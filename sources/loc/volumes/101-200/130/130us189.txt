WILLIAMSON v. NEW JERSEY.

189

Syllabus.

Judge Dillon, that taxes are not liens upon the property
against which they are assessed, unless made so by the charter, or unless the corporation is authorized by the legislature
to declare them to be liens. But here no taxes have been
assessed except those which have been released by the bondholders accepting new bonds for the interest of the year so
assessed. And it is too clear for argument that taxes not
assessed are no liens, and that the obligation to assess taxes is
not a lien on the property on which they ought to be assessed."
From the record before us, we think the decision of the
court below, that no lawful assessment of the tax had been
made; that no lien upon the lots in question exists; and that
the appellant is not entitled to the relief prayed for in his
cross-bill, accords fully with the decisions of this court, above
referred to.
As the points disposed of are decisive of the case, we deem
it unnecessary to discuss the effect of the temporary restraining order upon the validity of the collector's sale. The decree
of the Supreme Court is
Aflimed.

WILLIAMSON v. NEW JERSEY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 193. Argued March 12, 189.-Decided April 1, 1889.
The legislature of New Jersey, by a statute, enacted that a "poor farm,"
belonging to the city of New Brunswick, and situated in the township
of North Brunswick, should be at all times thereafter liable and subject
to taxation by that township so long as it should be embraced within its
limits. Subsequently, it was enacted by a statute, that the property of
the cities of the State, and all land used exclusively for charitable purposes should be exempt from taxation, and that all inconsistent acts
were repealed. The "poor farm" was used exclusively for charitable
purposes; Held:
(1) The provision of the first statute was repealed;
(2) The legislature could constitutionally repeal the power of taxation
given by the first statute;

Opinion of the Court.
(3) The first statute did not create a contract between the State and the
township, the obligation of which could not be constitutionally
impaired by its repeal.
The power of taxation on the part of a municipal corporation is not private
property, or a vested right of property in its hands; but the conferring
of such power is an exercise by the legislature of a public and governmental power which cannot be imparted in perpetuity, and is always
subject to revocation, modification and control, and is not the subject of
contract.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.
.lJr.John,S. IFoorkees for plaintiff in error.
-Mr. Robert Adrian for defendant in error.
AMr. Frederick TFeigel filed a brief for defendant in error.
AMm. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of
New Jersey. The case arose on a writ of certiorariissued by
that court at the instance of the mayor and common council
of the city of New Brunswick, to review an assessment for
taxation made by the township of North Brunswick, and a
levy made by the collector of that township, against a farm
known as the "poor farm," and personal property thereon,
situated in the township of North Brunswick, and owned by
the mayor and common council of the city of New Brunswick.
The case arose on the following facts, which were agreed upon
by the counsel for the respective parties:
By a special act of the legislature of New Jersey, approved
February 28, 1860, (Laws of 1860, c. 6[, p. 162,) pai'ts of the
townships of North Brunswick and Monroe, in the county
of Middlesex were set off and established as a separate township, to be called East Brunswick, and part of the township
of North Brunswick was set off and established as a separate
township, to be called the township of New Brunswick, and
the township committees of the said townships of North
Brunswick, East Brunswick and New Brunswick were author-

ized and required to divide the real and personal property of
the township of North Brunswick between said townships.
The poor farm of the original township of North Brunswick
was situated within the limits of what remained of the township of North Brunswick, after the setting off of the townships of East Brunswick and New Brunswick as aforesaid.
By a special act of the legislature, approved March 15,
1861, (Laws of 1861, c. 170, p. 507,) the said township of New
Brunswick and the city of New Brunswick were declared to
be one corporate body under the name of "The Corporation
of the City of New Brunswick," and the said corporation was
made subject to all the liabilities of the inhabitants of the
township of New Brunswick.
The poor farm and the personal property thereon were
never divided between the townships of North Brunswick
and East Brunswick and the corporation of the city of New
Brunswick, but the townships agreed to sell and convey their
interests in the same to said corporation.
By a special act of the legislature, approved February 18,
1862, (Laws of 1862, c. 37, p. 52,) the township committees of
North Brunswick and East Brunswick were authorized to
convey all the interests of the said townshi-s in said farm
and the personal property thereon to the said corporation;
and it was thereby further enacted that the said poor farm
and the personal property thereon should be at all times
thereafter liable and subject to taxation by the township of
North Brunswick so long as it should be embraced in the
limits of said township.
By virtue of the authority thereby given, the township
committees of said townships sold and conveyed said farm
and the personal property thereon to said corporation by deed
of conveyance bearing date March 27, 1862.
The said corporation of the city of New Brunswick entered
into possession of said farm and the personal property thereon
under the contract expressed in said deed of conveyance, and
is still in possession of the same, and the said farm is still
within the limits of the township of North Brunswick.
The said farm and property have been duly assessed by the

township of North Brunswick each year since said sale and
conveyance, and the taxes so assessed have been paid by the
corporation of the city of New Brunswick to the township of
North Brunswick up to and including the year 1877, when
further payments were refused on the ground that said poor
farm was used exclusively for charitable purposes, and therefore was not liable to taxation.
This certioraribrings up the assessment for the year 1878,
for the purpose of determining whether said farm and personal
property thereon are liable and subject to taxation by said
township of North Brunswick.

act approved February 18, 1862, is set forth in the margin.'

East Brunswick and the corporation of the city of New Brunswick, which

Brunswick, and owned by the city of New Brunswick, was
exempt from taxation; and that the poor farm referred to,
the buildings thereon and the furniture and fixtures therein,
were used exclusively for charitable purposes by the city of
New Brunswick, the owner thereof.
The questions considered by the Supreme Court of New
Jersey were (1) whether the 2d section of the act approved
February 18, 1862, was repealed by the general tax law of the
State, approved April, 11, 1866, (Revised Laws 1150,) the 5th
section of which enacted that the property of the cities of the
State, and all buildings used exclusively for charitable purposes, with the land whereon the same are erected and which
may be necessary for the fair enjoyment thereof, and the
furniture and personal property used therein, shall be exempt
from taxation; and the 32d section of which, after repealing
certain acts named, repealed all other acts or parts of acts,
whether special or local or otherwise, inconsistent with the
provisions of the act of 1866, except one act approved in 1864
and such special or local acts as had been approved since 1862;
(2) whether, if the legislature had, by the act of April 11, 1866,
declared its purpose to repeal the 2d section of the act of
February 18, 1862, such purpose could be constitutionally enforced.
The Supreme Court held 15 Vroom, (44 N. J. Law,) 165,
(1) that the declaration in the general law of 1866 that all acts
and parts of acts, whether special or local or otherwise, inconsistent with its provisions, were repealed, abrogated the provisions in the prior special act of 1862 for the taxation of the
poor farm and the personal property thereon by the township of
North Brunswick, because such provision in the act of 1862 was
inconsistent with the provision in the act of 1866 exempting
from taxation all property of the cities of the State and all
property used exclusively for charitable purposes; (2) that the
legislature could constitutionally repeal the power of taxing
said party of the second part, their successors and assigns, to the use of
the party of the second part, their successors and assigns.

their hands and seals the day and year first above written.

Opinion of the Court.

the poor farm and the personal property thereon, given by the
act of 1862 to the township of North Brunswick. The court
decided that the provisions of the two statutes could not stand
together, and that it was impossible to give full effect to the
language of the repealing provision of the act of 1866 and keep
in operation the second section of the act of 1862. It also
decided that the provision of the second section of the act of
1862 (lid not become, by reason of the subsequent conveyance
of March 27, 1862, to the corporation of the city of New
Brunswick, a contract between that corporation and the township of North Brunswick, the obligation of which the legislature was forbidden to impair; that one legislature could not
confer upon a township a power of taxation which a subsequent
legislature could not revoke against the objection of the township; that the power of a legislature over a corporation created
for the purposes of local government was supreme; that no
contract with such a corporation arose from the delegation to
it of taxing authority, citing Tinsman v. Belvedere Del. Railroad, 2 Dutcher (26 N. J. Law), 148; -Mayor v. Jersey City &
Bergen Railroad, 5 C. E. Green (20 N. J. Eq.), 360; and
Rader v. Southeasterly Road Dist., 7 Vroom (36 N. J. Law),
273; and that the power of taxation was not in any sense the
private property of the municipality, but was peculiarly a public and governmental power, and must, as such, be at all times
susceptible of repeal or modification, according to legislative
discretion, so far as the mere right of the township to exercise
it was concerned.
The judgment of the Supreme Court was that the assessment of taxes should be set aside. The collector of the township removed the case, by a writ of error, to the Court of
Errors and Appeals of the State, which affirmed the judgment, in an opinion 17 Vroom, (46 N. J. Law,) 204, adopting
the reasons given by the Supreme Court. The case having
been remitted to the Supreme Court, the collector has brought
it here by a writ of error to that court.
On the question as to the effect of the act of 1866, in repealing the 2d section of the act of 1862, we concur with the
highest court of New Jersey, that the provisions of the two

WILLIAMSON v. NEW JERSEY.
Opinion of the Court.

statutes cannot stand together, and that it is impossible to
give full effect to the language of the repealing provision of
the act of 1866, and keep in operation the 2d section of the
act of 1862. We must therefore hold, as the state court held,
that the 2d section of the act of 1862 was repealed by the
act of 1866. This leaves open only the consideration of the
question as to whether the 2d section of the act of 1862
created a contract, the obligation of which could not be constitutionally impaired by the repeal of such 2d section.
It is contended for the collector, that the tax provided for
by the 2d section of the act of 1862 is in the nature of a
ground-rent, and of a right reserved by the township of North
Brunswick, out of the land conveyed by the deed of March,
1862; that the fee of the poor farm belonged to the township
in its private and proprietary character; that the farm had
been acquired by the taxation of the inhabitants of the township; that the legislature could not deprive them of it without
their consent; that the township was authorized by the legislature to convey the farm to the corporation of the city of
New Brunswick for the consideration, in part, of the right of
the township of North Brunswick to tax it so long as it should
be embraced in the limits of that township; that, in taking
the title, the city of New Brunswick agreed to pay to that
township an annual sum to be determined in amount by the
annual tax-rate of that township, so long as the farm should
remain under, and receive the benefit of, the municipal government of that township; that the right thus reserved, of
levying and collecting such tax, became thereby vested in that
township, and the amount of tax, when determined, became
its private property; and that the case involves the question
of the authority of the legislature over the private property
and vested rights of the township, and not the question of its
authority over the public and governmental powers of the
township.
We concur in the views of the Court of Errors and Appeals
of New Jersey on this question. It is not the same question
as that involved in the principle recognized by this court, that
a provision in an act of a legislature, exempting certain speci-

OOTOBltP TEkM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

fled property from taxation by the authorities of a State or
a municipality, for all time or for a limited time, constitutes
a contract in respect of such property, the obligation of which
cannot be impaired by a subsequent legislature, and is, therefore, a contract within the protection of the Constitution of
the United States.
It is to be observed in the present case, that the act of February 18, 1862, does not assert or recognize the fact that the
privilege of taxing the poor farm in the future was a part of
the consideration for the conveyance of that farm by the township of North Brunswick. The act recites that the townships
of North Brunswick and East Brunswick had agreed to convey and sell to the corporation of the city of New Brunswick
their interest in the poor farm and the personal property
thereon, for the sum of $2611.13, "the value of the interest
of those townships therein." It then empowers the two townships to convey their interest in the poor-farm and the personal property thereon to the corporation of the city of New
Brunswick "for the sum aforesaid." It then enacts, in the 2d
section, which is a separate and independent section, "that the
said poor farm and the personal property thereon shall be at
all times hereafter liable and subject to taxation by the said
township of North Brunswick so long as it is embraced in the
limits of the said township of North Brunswick."
So, also, the deed of March 27, 1862, recites as its consideration the sum of $2611.13, paid by the corporation of the city
of New Brunswick to the grantors. No other consideration is
expressed. The act of February 18, 1862, is incorporated in
the deed, as the authority by virtue of which the grantors
convey the property.
It is not intended to suggest that, if the right of taxation
had been named in the act or in the deed as a part of the consideration for the conveyance, it would have made a different
case; but reference is made to the actual provisions of the act
and the deed solely for the purpose of showing that they
evince no idea on the part of the legislature, or of the parties
to the conveyance, that the perpetual right of taxation, now
asserted, formed any part of the consideration of the transaction.

WILLIAMSON v. NEW JERSEY.
Opinion of the Court.

The true principle involved in the case is, whether the power
of taxation on the part of a municipal corporation is private
property, or a vested right of property, in its hands, which,
when once conferred upon it by an act of the legislature, cannot be subsequently modified or repealed. Even without the
special provision of the 2d section of the act of February 18,
1862, it is to be presumed that the poor farm and the personal
property thereon would, while situated in the township of
North Brunswick, be subject to taxation by that township unless exempted from such taxation on the ground of a charitable use. The special question in this case arises, therefore,
solely out of the use of the words, in the 2d section, "at all
times hereafter." The provision of the 2d section, and the
contention here made on the part of the collector, necessarily
imply the authority of the legislature to confer the power of
taxation upon the township, and the non-existence of such
power unless conferred by the legislature. The question arising is, therefore, whether the legislature which passed the act
of February 18, 1862, could lawfully so grant the power of
taxation to the township in perpetuity, that a subsequent legislature could not repeal or modify such grant of power.
We are clearly of opinion that such a grant of the power of
taxation, by the legislature of a State, does not form such a
contract between the State and the township as is within the
protection of the provision of the Constitution of the United
States which forbids the passage by a .State of a law impairing the obligation of contracts. The conferring of such right
of taxation is an exercise by the legislature of a public and
governmental power. It is the imparting to the township of
a portion of the power belonging to the State, which it can
lawfully impart to a subordinate municipal corporation. But,
from the very character of the power, it cannot be imparted
in perpetuity, and is always subject to revocation, modification
and control by the legislative authority of the State. The
authorities to this effect are uniform. 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp.

Illinois, 27, 30; Gutzweller v. People, 14 Illinois, 142; Sangamon County v. City of Springfield, 63 Illinois, 66, 71.
In the present case the 2d section of the act of February 18,
1862, has no more force than if the words "at all times hereafter" had been omitted; and the section is to be construed as
if it only temporarily conferred the right of taxation on the
township, subject to be recalled at the pleasure of the legislature. There is no element of private property in the right of
taxation conferred upon a municipal corporation. Property
acquired by paying for it with money raised by taxation is
property. The legislation in question does not affect or interfere with any such property. The poor farm and the personal
property thereon are not the property of the township of
North Brunswick, but are the property of the corporation of
the city of New Brunswick. Nor is there anything violative
of any provision of the Constitution of the United States in
the enactment of the legislature of New Jersey, that the property in question shall be exempt from taxation because it is
used exclusively for charitable purposes. The long recognized
and universally prevalent policy of making such exemption is
a warrant for saying that the 2d section of the act of February
18, 1862, is fairly to be regarded as containing an implied
reservation that such exemption might be thereafter made, as
being the exercise of a public and governmental power, resting
wholly in the discretion of the legislature, and not the subject
of contract.
