that suit, and was fairly covered by the prayer for such relief as might be deemed just and equitable. Besides, if that
company was a party to the Vose suit, and we have seen that
it was, the decree, so far as it rescinds the agreement or contracts it had with the trustees, and restores to the Internal
Improvement Fund the lands covered by these contracts, was
not void. If erroneous, it could onl:r be avoided by an appeal.
It cannot be questioned in this collateral proceeding.
It results from what has been said that the conveyance
by the trustees to the Southern Inland Navigation Company
was subject to such decree as the court might render in the
Vose suit; and as the decree of December 1, 1873, rescinded
the agreements which the latter had with the former in respect to lands constituting a part of the trust fund, and restored to that fund the lands conveyed, or attempted to be
conveyed, to that company by the trustees, the conveyance of
February 10, 1871, and the mortgage of March 20, 1871, based
upon it, is invalid as against the present trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of Florida.

SYMNOTT v. SHAUGHNESSY.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE L mAR delivered the opinion of the court.
On the 24th of May, 1882, John Synnott and Peter Welch
commenced an action in one of the territorial courts of Idaho
Territory against Michael Shaughnessy, to have annulled the
sale of the Eureka Silver Mine, situated in Mineral Hill mining district, Alturas County, in that Territory, and to compel
him to reconvey the same to them as vendors. In their complaint the plaintiffs alleged that on the 5th day of July, 1881,
they were the owners each of an undivided one half, and in
the lawful possession, of the Eureka silver-mining claim, particularly describing it by metes and bounds, which they had
located in June, 1880, and upon which they had developed a
small seam or vein of galena ore, worth about $1000; that
this vein was all of the ore which had been discovered by
them, or either of them, upon the mining claim up to that
time, and that they were ignorant of the existence of any
other vein or body of ore, and believed that all the value that
was then attached to the mining claim arose from the developments they had made upon the claim and the ore they had
discovered, and did not exceed $2500; that on or about the
3d of July, 1881, the defendant by his agents or employ6s, had
discovered upon a part of the Eureka mining claim, remote
from the places where the plaintiffs had been at work, a large
and valuable vein, or body of ore, from eighteen inches to four
feet in thickness, extending about seventy feet continuously
along said vein, the existence of which rendered the mine worth
at least $100,000, and of the existence of which these plaintiffs
were wholly ignorant; that the defendant, by his agents and
servants, intending to cheat and defraud these plaintiffs, fraudulently and falsely concealed and suppressed from them the
knowledge of the existence of such vein or ore body, and misrepresented the facts concerning the same, and fraudulently
and falsely represented to them that no other ore body or vein
of ore existed in the mining claim, except such as was known
to these plaintiffs; that such false and fraudulent statements
were made by the defendant, his agent and employ~s, in order
to enable him to purchase the mining claim at a price far below

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

its real value; that by means of such false and fraudulent concealment and misrepresentations these plaintiffs, who believed
the same to be true, were made to believe that no other body
or vein of ore existed in the mining claim than that which was
known to them, and that the real value of the claim was not
more than $2200; that immediately prior to the discovery of
the ore vein or ore body by the defendant, these plaintiffs had
employed one Henry Porter as an agent to find for them a
purchaser of their claim at the sum of $2500, and agreed to
pay him ten per cent of that sum if he should make a sale
thereof at the price mentioned; that during such employment
of Porter, and while he was endeavoring to obtain a purchaser
for the mine, he, himself, first made the discovery of the aforesaid ore vein and ore body, which was unknown to these plaintiffs; that upon such discovery Porter concealed the same
from the plaintiffs, and falsely and collusively and for a consideration paid to him by the defendant, to wit, $1000, informed the
defendant of the existence of such large vein or ore body, and
then and there, in violation of his employment by these plaintiffs,
and in fraud of their rights, entered into the employment of the
defendant, and undertook and agreed to assist him in concealing from them the knowledge of the existence of the ore body
he had discovered, and in obtaining the mining claim from
them at the price of $2200, which was greatly below its real
value; that by reason of those false, fraudulent and collusive
acts of Porter, as well as the misrepresentations and concealments of the defendant, these plaintiffs were induced to part
with their property for the sum of $2200, and to execute and
deliver to the defendant a quit-claim deed of the Eureka mining claim, dated on the 5th day of July, 1881, which was
afterwards duly recorded; that by reason of such conveyance
thus fraudulently obtained from them, and if the same be not
declared fraudulent, null and void, they will sustain great
pecuniary loss and damage, to wit, $100,000; that since the
conveyance to the defendant of the mining claim he has been
in the possession of the same, and has extracted and taken therefrom a large quantity of ore and has made large profits therefrom, to wit, over $3000; and that the plaintiffs are ready and

Opinion of the Court.

willing and hereby offer to repay to the defendant the sum of
$2200, the purchase price of the mining claim, together with
interest from July 5, 1881, upon a reconveyance of the mining
property to them.
The prayer for relief was, (1) That the deed of July 5, 1881,
be declared fraudulent, null and void, and set aside by the
court, and the defendant be decreed to reconvey the mining
claim and premises to the plaintiffs upon their paving him the
purchase price thereof, together with lawful interest from the
date of the purchase; (2) that the defendant be decreed to
account to the plaintiffs for the net proceeds of the ore extracted by him from the mining claim since his purchase
thereof, and upon such accounting be decreed to pay the same
to the plaintiffs; (3) that the defendant, his agents and employ~s, be enjoined and restrained from interfering with the
mining claim, or extracting or clearing away any of the ore
therefrom; (4) that the plaintiffs be put in possession of the
mining claim by the process of the court; (5) That the defend
ant be decreed to pay the costs of this action; and (6) for
other and further relief.
The answer of the defendant denied specifically all the
material allegations of the complaint, and set out in detail
the circumstances attending the purchase of the mine, which,
if proved, would establish his good faith in such purchase, and
the absence of any fraudulent acts on the part of himself or
any of his agents connected with such transactions.
The cause having been heard upon the pleadings and proofs,
the court found the facts in favor of the defendant, and entered a decree in his favor. Upon appeal to the Supreme
Court of the Territory, that decree was in all respects affirmed; and an appeal from the latter decree brings the case
here.
The findings of fact by the trial court, and which were
adopted by the Supreme Court of the Territory, are twenty in
number, and elaborately set out all the facts and circumstances
attending the sale of the mine. The material facts, as gathered
from these findings, stated briefly, are as follows:
For some time prior to the 5th of July, 1881, the plaintiffs,

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Synnott and Welch, had owned the Eureka mine, and had lived
in a cabin near by. They had done considerable work in
developing it, and had found a small vein of ore, from which
they had extracted, through several tunnels, about 81000
worth of ore, then lying on the premises. They were desirous of selling the claim, and entered into an agreement with
one Porter, to pay him a commission of ten per cent on the
sale thereof, in case he realized from such sale $2500.
Under these arrangements Porter first applied to one John
Gilman to purchase the claim, but no agreement was reached
between them. Porter then, on the morning of July 5, 1881,
tried to induce one E. A. Wall (who afterwards acted as the
agent of the defendant Shaughnessy) to purchase the claim.
He informed Wall that he had a verbal option of purchase
at the price of $2000, and that his terms would be a commission of $500, or one fourth of the claim, if Wall should
purchase it. In the same interview he stated to Wall that
he thought he could show him something on the claim that
would induce him to buy it. Porter then having disclosed to
Wall that he had a further appointment with Gilman to resume negotiations regarding the claim, Wall declined to have
any further conference, or to make any terms for the purchase,
so long as negotiations with Gilman continued.
Porter then met Gilman, and they inspected the claim together. Porter showed him float ore which he had discovered
at two places on the claim, one of which was on and about
the path which Synnott and Welch had usually travelled from
their cabin to their work on the claim, and the other at a
point about fifty yards from that path. After this inspection
Gilman went immediately to Synnott and Welch, and had
further negotiations with them, but they failed to agree on
any terms. Synnott and Welch then informed Porter that
they were willing to sell the claim for $2000, but that in that
case could not allow him any commission.
On the evening of that day Porter again went to Wall, and
resumed negotiations. They went together over the Eureka
claim, and Porter showed Wall the float ore he had found,
and insisted on having one fourth of the claim for his option

Opinion of the Court.

and for showing the float ore. Wall informed him that if he
bought the claim it would be for the defendant Shaughnessy,
who might prefer to be the sole owner, and proposed that if
Porter would allow him ten days to decide he would either
allow him one fourth of the claim or pay him $1000, to which
Porter agreed, and at the end of that period, and after the
purchase, the $1000 was paid to Porter accordingly. After
their examination of the claim Wall went with Porter to the
cabin of Synnott and Welch and informed them that he would
buy the claim for $2000, to which they assented. Wall then
told them to come down to his office at Bullion and make out
their deed, and they agreed to do so. After Wall and Porter
had left, Gilman returned and resumed negotiations with
Synnott and Welch, finally offering them $1800 and one tenth
of the proceeds of the claim, or $2200 in money for the whole.
He also informed them of the fact that Porter had discovered
float ore on the place. After Gilman had gone away, Porter
returned to the cabin of Synnott and Welch, and the three
went together to Wall's office. On the way they informed
Porter of the offer made by Gilman, and intimated that they
would expect the same from Wall, because they were poor,
and could not afford to lose the $200, or pay any commission.
On their arrival at Wall's office, Porter informed Wall of
Gilman's offer, whereupon Wall told them that he would pay
$2200 for the claim, adding with some asperity, that Gilman
should not have it at any price. The deed from Synnott and
Welch to Shaughnessy for $2200 was then drawn and executed
and attested, and was acknowledged the following day.
The day after the sale Porter did some work on the claim
at one of the points where he had found float ore, and on the
following day Wall, as agent of the defendant, put miners at
work at one of the places where float ore had been observed,
and in the course of a few days, by an open cut 20 by 25 feet,
discovered a body of ore in place, which, when taken out,
weighed 23 tons, and netted the defendant about $800.
The ore exposed by Synnott and Welch was taken out and
sold by the defendant, netting him about $90.
The defendant afterwards expended about $23,000 in develVOL. cxxx-37

oping the claim, and discovered a large and valuable lode.
He has sold ore from it to the amount of about $3000. At
the time this suit was brought he had opened negotiations for
the sale of the claim at $150,000.
The plaintiffs in error rest their case upon two propositions,
viz.: (1) The defendant, with knowledge of the existence of a
large "body of ore" in this claim, by his agent, who made the
purchase, wilfully misled the plaintiffs in relation thereto, and
induced them to sell for a price which they would not have
sold for had they been truly informed of the facts. (2) The
defendant, by his agent (Wall), entered into an agreement to
pay the agent of the plaintiffs (Porter) a sum of money to
conceal from his principals his knowledge of the existence of a
valuable body of ore, which he had informed the defendant's
agent of, and then procured a conveyance from the plaintiffs
of the claim in fraud of their rights.
These two propositions, in our opinion, are clearly negatived
by the 12th, 14th and 15th findings of fact, which are as
follows:
"12. The evidence in the case does not show or tend to
show that Wall or Porter or any other person had discovered
or knew of the existence of any vein or lode of ore in place on
the Eureka mining claim, other than such as had been found
by and was known to Synnott and Welch, in their excavations,
at any time prior to the sale and execution of the deed."
"14. No false or fraudulent representations concerning the
Eureka mining claim were ever madd to said vendors or any
one else by the defendant, or by any agent or employ6 of his.
"15. No concealment of any material fact concerning said
mining claim was ever made by the defendant or by any
agent or employ6 of his. Neither the defendant nor any
agent of his bad ever discovered or knew of the existence of
any vein or lode on said claim (except such as Synnott and
Welch had exposed by their tunnels) prior to the sale, nor
until some days had elapsed after the sale."
In the assignment of errors, however, it is insisted that
these findings are not responsive to the allegations of the
complaint. It is said that the trial court did not make any

SYNNOTT v. SHAUGHNESSY.
Opinion of the Court.

findings on the following material issues: (1) It did not find
as to the value of the ore body discovered in the Eureka
mining claim by Porter, and by him shown to Wall at the
time the purchase was made by the latter for the defendant;
(2) it did not find as to the knowledge of the existence and
extent of such ore body by Wall, at the date last mentioned;
(3) it failed to find whether Porter discovered any ore body,
as alleged, and, if so, when, and what was its value and extent;
what concealments were practised by him upon the plaintiffs,
if any; what knowledge defendant or his agent had of these
concealments; whether plaintiffs were offered or received the
value of the claim at the time of the sale thereof; what the
defendant paid Porter the $1000 for; what the contract was
between Porter and Wall; and what were Porter's relations to
the vendors at the time of the sale.
We do not think there is much force in this contention. It
will be observed that the basis of this assignment of error is
the assumption that Porter, as the agent of the plaintiffs, prior
to the day the mine was sold, had discovered a valuable body
of ore, the knowledge of which he concealed from the plaintiffs,
and imparted to the defendant.
This assumption, as shown by the findings, to which we are
restricted, is entirely without foundation. Neither Porter nor
the defendant or his agent, Wall, ever discovered any vein or
lode of ore on the claim at any time prior to the sale thereof
by the plaintiffs. The counsel for appellants contend that the
court, in finding that Porter or Wall discovered no "vein " oi"lode," did not find that they discovered no "ore body." We
deem it sufficient to say that the context of the complaint shows
that those terms were used synonymously by the pleader, in
the common parlance of miners, and not with reference to any
technical distinction. The only indications of any such ore
body or vein that had been found were simply a few small
pieces of ore known as "float" ore, which did not of necessity
indicate the existence of any large ore body. Further, the
fact that Porter had found "float" ore on the claim was made
known to the plaintiffs before they made the deed for the
claim. Such purely surface indications, open to all ordinary

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

observers, and situated on or near the path along which the
plaintiffs travelled in going to and from their work, must have
been known to them, and are not such as to be made the subject
of concealment and misrepresentation. The fact, however,
that there was no such discovery of an actual vein or body of
ore demonstrates that there could have been no such fraudulent and collusive concealment and misrepresentation, as to its
limit and extent, as is charged in this complaint. It required
not only a considerable excavation, but also a great- outlay of
money and great labor on the part of the defendant to develop
the existence of a vein of ore.
This virtually disposes of both propositions advanced by the
plaintiffs in support of their contention. That the defendant
paid Porter $1000, there is no question. But that such sum
was paid him to conceal from the plaintiffs his knowledge of
the existence of a large ore body on the claim could not have
been true; for the findings state that he possessed no such
knowledge. It is presumable that the plaintiffs, as men of
ordinary intelligence, must have known that Porter was to
receive from the defendant, or his agent, Wall, a commission
for his work in the transactions connected with the sale of the
mine; for the findings show that they did not pay him anything out of the sum received from such sale, as their agent,
and informed him beforehand that while they were willing to
sell the claim for $2000, in that case they could not allow him
any commission. It really could make no difference to the
plaintiffs what he was paid, since they received for the claim
all they had asked for it, and in reality $200- more than they
had, a few hours before, agreed to take, and within $50 of
what they would have got if Porter had made the sale under
their first agreement with him.
There are no other features of the case that call for special
mention. In no aspect of it do we think either the law or the
equities are with the plaintiffs.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Idaho is, therefore,
Affi'med.
