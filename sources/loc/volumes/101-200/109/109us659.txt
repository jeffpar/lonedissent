BACHMAN v. LAWSON.
Syllabus.

United States having, in the phrase of Mr. Justice Story, "an
ubiquity throughoat the Union," may in their discretion, exercised through the appropriate officers, pay a debt, due to the
estate of a deceased person, either to the administrator appointed in the State of his domicil, or to an ancillary administrator duly appointed in the District of Columbia; and the exercise of their discretion in this regard cannot be controlled by
writ of mandamus.
It is hardly necessary to mention the proceedings in equity
upon the suit of Keyser. Though referred to in the petition
for the writ of mandamus in the general terms stated at the
beginning of this opinion, they have not been printed in full in
the record, as required by the eighth rule. The reason doubtless is, that both in the opinion of the court below and in the
argument in this court, while it is said that the administrator
appointed in Tennessee of the estate of John N. Pulliam was
made a defendant in that suit, and the bill taken for confessed
against him, it is admitted that he was not amenable as administrator to suit in this District, and that neither he, nor any
administrator hereafter appointed in Tennessee of the estate of
John J. Pulliam, could be concluded by that decree.
The result is, that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus
must be reversed, and the case remanded to that court, with
directions to

JUSTICE GRAY delivered the opinion of the court
This action was brought in the Superior Court of the City
of New York, by the members of the firm of Lawson &
Walker against the members of the firm of Bachman Brothers,
to recover compensation for services performed under a written agreement between them, dated April 25th, 1871, which
recited that the defendants had employed, and by power of
attorney of the same date had authorized, the plaintiffs to collect their "claim arising out of the capture of the ship Commonwealth and her cargo by the armed rebel cruiser, the
Florida;" and by which the plaintiffs agreed "to use their
best efforts, at their own expense, to collect the said claim in
the shortest practicable time;" and the defendants, in consideration of the premises, agreed to allow and pay to the plaintiffs "a compepsation equal to twenty-five per cent. of whatever sum shall be collected on said claim."
By the power of attorney, referred to in this agreement, the
defendants appointed the plaintiffs their attorneys to prosecute

and collect the claim by such lawful proceedings and means as
to them might appear expedient, but at their own cost and
-charge; and authorized them to receive on the defendants'
account whatever sums of money might be awarded on the
claim, and to give' in their name proper acquittances therefor;
to execute all papers necessary to secure the transfer of the
claim to any party, department, or government which might
assume the payment thereof; and to employ for the prosecution of the claim such attorneys as they might think fit.
The plaintiffs, who are average -adjusters, filed an abstract
of the claim in the Department of State, and in accordance
with the instructions issued by that Department, and from
papers and information furnished by the defendants, prepared
a memorial giving a full history of the circumstances relating
to the claim; and afterwards went to Washington several
times about this and other like claims; and after the passage of
the act of Congress of June 23d, 1874, c. 459, 18 Stat. 245, establishing the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, prepared and sent to the defendants for signature a petition to be
presented to that court, which, although repeatedly asked for,
was never returned; and the defendants, after endeavoring to
induce the plaintiffs to release them from the agreement, employed an attorney at law to prosecute their claim before that
court, which he did, and recovered thereon the sum of $3,034.16.
The plaintiffs brought this action to recover twenty-five per
cent. of this sum, less $125, the estimated expense which they
would have incurred had they proceeded and recovered the
money. The defendants, besides other defences presenting no
federal question, contended that the, agreement sued on had
been annulled and rescinded by the act of 1874. The judge presiding at the trial overruled the objection, and the jury returned
a verdict for the plaintiffs, on which judgment was rendered.
The defendants appealed to the general term of the Superior
Court, at which the judgment was reversed, and a new trial
ordered. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals,
which reversed the judgment of the general term, and remitted the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.
See 81 N. Y. 616. The Superior Court thereupon entered

Opinion of the Court.

judgment in accordance with the verdict, and the defendants
sued out this writ of error.
In support of the writ of error it was contended that the
agreement sued on had relation solely to the claim which existed at its date; that that claim was extinguished by the
operation of the Treaty of Washington, the Geneva Award,
and the payment by Great Britain to the United States of the
sum awarded; and that the claim successfully prosecuted
under the act of Congress and before the Court of Commissioners was a new claim, created by that act, and after the maling
of the agreement; or, if it could be treated in any respect as
the.same claim, was so changed in its character and circumstances that the agreement had no application to it.
But, as was said by Mr. Justice Story, delivering the judgment of this court, in a similar case:
"The right to indemnity f6r an unjust capture, whether against
the capt6rs or the sovereign, whether remediable in hfs own
courts, or by his own extraordinary interposition and grants upon
private petition, or upon public negotiation, is a right attached to
the ownership of the property itself." "'The very ground of the
that the municipal remedy is inadequate; -nd that the
treaty is,
party has a right to compensation for illegal captures, by an appeal to the justice of the government." "The right to compensation, in the eye of the treaty, was just- as perfect, though the
remedy was merely by petition, as the right to c6mpensation for
an illegal conversion of'property, in a municipal court of'justice."
"It recognized an existing right .to compensation, in the aggrieved
parties, and did not, in the most iemote degree, turn upon the notion of a donation or .atuity. It was demanded by our government as a matter of right," and as such itw-4s granted by Spain."
Corneg2/s v. 7ase, 1 Pet. 193, 215-217.

The claim established before the Court of Commissioners of
Alabam Calaims was manifestly thp very claim 6ontemplated
by the agreement in suit. It is described in that agreement as
a "claim arising out of the capture of the ship Commonwealth
and her cargo by the armed rebel cruiser the Florida.". The
agreement bears date only a fortnight before the Treaty of

BACHMAN v. LAWSON.
Opinion of the Court.

Washington was made and concluded, by which it was agreed
between the United States and Great Britain that all claims
growing out of acts committed by the Alabama and other vessels should be referred to a Tribunal of Arbitration. The
Florida was one of the vessels which were determined by the
Geneva Award to have put out fron British ports through
neglect of international duty on the part of Great Britain, and
compensation for the wrongs done by which to these defendants and others was included in the sum awarded in favor -of
the United States. The clalim of the defendants was one
for which compensation was justly due to them from Great
Britain ; was demanded by the United States from Great Britain
as a matter of right; as such was awarded to be paid and was
paid by Great Britain to the United States, in accordance with
the provisions of the treaty between the two nations, and with
the determination of the Tribunal of Arbitration created by that
treaty; and was paid by the United States to the defendants,
out of the money received from Great Britain, pursuant to the
directions of the act of Congress, and to the decision of the
Court of Commissioners established by that act. The defendants were the original owners of the claim, and the money was
granted and paid by the United States to them as such. The
money so demanded and received by the United States from
Great Britain, and paid by the United States to the defendants, was money collected on the claim described in the agreement. Comegy8 v. Tahse, above cited ; Pielps v. 2leDona

The other points relied on in support of the writ of error, so
far as they present any federal question, are based upon the
following provisions of the act of 1874:
"SECT. 18. In case any judgment is rendered by said court for
indemnity for any loss or claim hereinbefore mentioned against
the United States, at the time of the giving of the judgment the
court shall, upon motion of the attorney or counsel for the claimant, allow, out of the amount thereby awarded, such reasonable
counsel and attorney fees, to the counsel and attorney employed
by the claimant or claimants respectively, as the court shall de-

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

termine is just and .reasonable, as compensation for the services
rendered the claimant inf prosecuting such claims, which allowance shall be entered as part of the judgment in such case,'and
shall be made specifically payable as a part of said judgment for
indemnification to the attorney or counsel, or both, to whom
the same shall be adjudged ; and a warrant shall issue from the
treasury in. favor of the person to whom such allowance shall be
made respectively, which shall be in full compensation to the
counsel or attorney for prosecuting such claim; and all other
liens upon, or assignments, sales, transfers, either absolute or. conditional, for services rendered or to be rendered about any claim
or part or parcel thereof provided for in this bill, heretofore or
hereafter made or done before such judgment is awarded and the
warrant issued therefor, shall be absolutely null and void and of
none effect." 18 Stat. 249.'โข
It was argued that the act, by prescribing a mode of proceeding for collecting the claim which required the services of
attorneys at law, rendered the agreement in question inoperative, because the plaintiffs, not being such attorneys, were inscapable of-performing it. But the power of attorney executed
at the same time as the agreement, and referred to therein,
authorized the plaintiffs to use all such lawful means and proceedings, and to employ such attotneys, as they might think
fit, for the prosecution of the claim.
It 'Was further contended that. the section above quoted rendered illegal and void all dgreements, made before judgment,
to pay-compensation for services about any such claim. But
the prohibition is clearly limited 'to liens, sales, or assigments,
which create a right of property in the 'claim itself, and does
not extend to a mere personal agreement to pay as compensation for such services a sum of money equal to a certain proportion of the amount which may be recovered.
The other points made in argument present' no federal question, and therefore afford no ground upon which this court can
revise the judgment of the State court. _Yurdock v. XJfemphi8,
