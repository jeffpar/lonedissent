GUION v. LIVERPOOL, LONDON, AND GLOBE
INSURANCE (O.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF INDIANA.
Argned October 15th, 1883.-iecided November 5th, 1883.'

Appeal.

A person not a party in a suit cannot take an appeal in it.
On the 2d July, 1879, William H. Guion, claiming to have
an interest in the bonds of the appellee which were the subject
of controversy in the suit of Thp Indiana Southern Railroad
Company v. The Liverpool, Londo , & Globe Inmuranve Company, just reported, filed his petition in that suit in the court
below, asking to be admitted as a party to the suit for his own
protection. This petition was denied. Guion was allowed an
appeal on giving" bond and security for cost, but the transcript
does not show that he ever gave the bond.
The case was argued simultaneously with the case of The Indiana Southern Railroad Conpany, and by the same counsel

MR. CHIEF JUsTic WAITE, in delivering the opinion of the
court in that case, said:
The petition of Guion was for leave to appeal from a decree
in a suit to which he was not a party. We decided in Exparte
Cutting, 94 U. S. 14, that such an appeal could not be taken.
He had applied for leave to become a party, but this leave was
not given. So he is not a party to the decree from which he
appeals. But if he is, he has never perfected an appeal by
giving the hecessary security.
Appeal dismiesedfor want of jurisdicton.
