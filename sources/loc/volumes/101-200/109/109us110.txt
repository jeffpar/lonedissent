APPEAL FROM THE CIMCUrT COURT OF THE UTED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF LOUISIAHA.
Argued October 2 d, 1883.-Decided November 5th, 188.

Appeal-ontract-nsurance-Safage.
The owners of three steam-tugs which had pumping machinery were employed
by the master and agent of a ship sunk at a wharf in New Orleans, with a
cargo on board, to pump out the ship for a compensation of $50 per hour
for each boat, "to be continued until the boats were discharged." When
the boats were about to begin pumping, the United States marshal seized
the ship and cargo on a warrant on a libel for salvage. After the seizure
the marshal took possession of the ship and displaced the authority of the
master, but permitted the tugs to pump out the ship. After they had
pumped for about eighteen hours, the ship was raised and placed in a position of safety. The tugs remained by the ship, ready to assist her in case
of need, for twelve days, but their attendance was unnecessary, and not required by any peril of ship or cargo. .In libels of intervention, in the suit
for salvage, the owners of the tugs claimed each $50 per hour forthe whole
time, including the twelve days, as salvage. The claims were resisted by
insurers of the cargo, to whom it wa- abandoned. The District Court allowed $500 to each tug, and $500 to the crew of each tug. On appeal by
the owners Qf the tugs, the Circuit Court decreed to each of them $1,000.
On further appeal by them, this court affirmed that decree.
Held, That to enforce the contract as one continuing during the time claimed
would be highly inequitable ; and, as against the insurers of the cardo, the
right of the tugs to compensation must be regarded as having terminated
when the ship and cargo were raised, and the tugs must be regarded as
having been then dischargbl.
The decree of the Circuit Court was entered M1ay 24th, 1880. June 26th a
cross appeal to this court, returnable at its October term following, was
allowed. The bond thereon was filed in the Circuit Court July 5th. But
the appellants in it did not docket it, or enter their appearance on it, in this
court, until September 27th, 1883: Hrd, That it must be dismissed.

Statement of Facts.

These were three libels of intervention fied in the District
Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, against
the ship Tornado, her cargo and freight, and the proceeds
thereof in the registry of that court, to recover for salvage
services rendered by three steam-tugs, the Rio Grande, the
Norman and the Harry Wright.
The libel in the case of the Rio Grande alleged an employment of her owners on the 27th of February, 1878, by the
masters and agents of the Tornado, "to pump out and raise
said ship and her cargo," with the pumps and appliances of the
Rio Grande, for a compensation of $50 per hour, and claimed
$14,900, for 298 hours, from 6 o'clock P.m. on February 27ith,
till 4 o'clock .Am. on March 12th. It alleged that the marshal
of the United States seized the ship while the work was going
on, and directed the libellants to proceed under the contract to
finish the work.
The libel in the case of the Norman alleged an employment
of her owners on the 27th of February, by the master and
agents of the Tornado, "to, assist in pumping out and raising
said ship and cargo," by the use of the Norman and her appliances, for a compensation of $50 per hour, and claimed $13,900,
for 278 hours, from 6 o'clock P.m. on February 27th, till 8
o'clock Am. on M arch 11th. The'libel alleged that the ship
was under seizure by the marshal when the work was commenced, and that the marshal continued the services of the
Norman till the saving of the ship and cargo was fully assured.
The libel in the case of the Rio Grande alleged an.employment of her owners, on February 27th, to pump water, out of
the ship, and to 'remain near her afterwards ready to render
service, for a compensation of $50 per hour, and claimed $11,200,
for 224 hours, from 10 o'clock P.m. on February 27th, till 6 o'clock
The libel alleged that the ship was raised
A.M. on March 9th.
and saved, with her cargo, late in the afternoon of February
28th; and that the marshal, after he seized the ship and cargo,
continued the employment of the tug under said contract.
The resistance to these claims was made by the underwriters
on the cargo, to whom the cargo was abandoned. Their
answer alleged that the ship and cargo andz-hor freight were

seized by the marshal about midday of February 27th; that
the three tugs came about sundown on the 27th,but performed
no effective service in pumping during that night; that effective
pumping began the next morning; and that by noon on the
28th the ship was raised out of water, and was free from all
danger of sinking or again taldng in water.
The district court awarded $1,000 to each tug, one-half to
her owners and the other half to her crew. The owners of the
three tugs appealed to the circuit court, and that court
awarded to the owners of each tug $1,000, and they appealed to this court. The circuit coart found the facts and
the conclusions of law on which it rendered its decree. There
was no bill of exceptions, and the review of the decree is
limited to a determination of the questions of law arising on
the record. The material findings of fact by the circuit court
were as follows:
"The ship Tor~nado was a vessel of 1,720 tons burden, and.

had come to the port of New Orleans for a cargo of cotton, which
she had shipped and stowed away, to the amount of 5,195 bales.,
She was almost ready for sea, and was lying alongside the wharf
in the Third District of the city of New Orleans, at the foot of
Marigny street, when, on Sunday, the 24th of February, 1878, at
six o'clock A.m., smoke was found coming out of the main hatch,

and a number of the crew were at once sent to the nearest firealarm box, and the fire department of the city of New Orleans
"were quickly on the spot. The main hatch having been opened,
the fire-engines immediately commenced to throw water down
the main hatch, which they continued to do until nine o'clock
A.m., when the main hatch wa closed, and the steam gas-boat

Protector, being provided with apparatus for the manufacture
of carbonic acid gas, commenced to attempt to extinguish the fire,
which at that time was raging quite violently in the hold, by
attempting to fill the vessel with carbonic acid gas. This continued until nine o'clock

P.M.,

when the main hatch was opened,

and it was found that there was less smoke than there had been
before the experiment with the gas had commenced. The engineer of the Protector went down the main hatch, and having hooked on to some bales of the cotton they were hoisted up

and landed on the levee greatly charred. In the meantime the
fire-engines were pumping in water through the hatch hole, and
the smoke was increasing. A hole was then out in the deck abreast
the main rigging on the starboard side, and some fourteen bales
of cotton were got out of this hole. At six o'clock P.m. smoke
was greatly increasing and the hatches were again put on, and
the hole in the deck covered, and the Protector again commenced pouring carbonic acid gas into the hold of the vessel, and
continued doing so during the night. While these things were
going on, the harbor tug-boats, the Continental, the N. M.
Jones, the Belle D)arlington, the Fern, the Aspinwall, the
Charlie Wood, the Ida, the Ella Wood No. 2, the Joseph
Cooper, Jr., and the Wasp, had all got there, hearing that the
vessel was in peril, and were, with the fire department, engaged
in pouring water, with their more or less powerful pumps, upon
the fire, at all times when the gas experiments were not going
on. Arriving at the scene of the disaster, some earlier than
others, they were all there during the whole of the first day.
On Monday the 25th of February, at six o'clock in the morning, the main hatch was opened, and the hole that had been made
in the deck was uncovered, and the smoke was found&to be greatly
increased ; some thirty-two bales of cotton were at this time taken
out by the stevedores. The fire department was hard at work
pumping water, and several holes were qut in the decks, trying
to get at the seat of the fire. The main pumps were taken up
to allow the hose suction to be put down, and the Protector and
the steam engines were pumping out the water part of the day,
but the smoke kept on increasing. At six o'clock P.m. there
were twelve feet six inches of water in the hold, and the
draft of water aft was twenty-three feet eight inches, and forward twenty-five feet six inches. At eleven and a half P.M. the
smoke was still increasing and appearing, and the crew were
employed in landing the sails and new ropes, sizing stuff, and
all that could be got at, on the wharf. On Tuesday, the 26th of
February, at six o'clock Am., Canby, the regular stevedore of the
vessel, and his men, came on board and landed the boats and
water casks on the wharf, tore up the forward deck and carlings
and commenced to save cargo. By noon the stevedore Drysdale
had 181 bales landed, and Mr. Canby 100. The fire department
were pouring in water during the night and all the forenoon, and

still the smoke increased, and by noon the men were forced to
come up from the hold, and the fire brigade were set to work to
fill the ship with water, it having been determined by the captain
that the only chance of saving any part of the ship or cargo was
to fill her with water and sink her, it being deemed impossible to
stop the fire otherwise; and about seven o'clock P.m. of Tuesday,
February 26th, the ship sank, the water being two or three feet
above the main deck. On Wednesday, February 27th, Ellis, the
master, and Shultz, the agent of the Tornado, made a contract
with the tow-boat association to which the Norman,, Rio
Grande, and Harry Wright belonged, to pump out the Tornado for a compensation of fifty dollars per hour for each boat,
to be continued until the boats were discharged. After the making of said contract, and while the Tornado still lay upon the
bottom of the river, the Protector filed a libel for salvage
against the Tornado and cargo, and, by virtue of a warrant
issued on said libel, the United States marshal seized the Tornado and cargo when the said tow-boats were about to begin
pumping her out. After the seizure the marshal took possession
of the Tornado and displaced the authority of the master,
but permitted the said tow-boats to proceed and pump out the
*Tornado.
The said tow-boats commenced pumping out the
Tornado early in the evening of February 27th, assisted by
othier tugs and the fire department of the city of New Orleans,
and succeeded, with said assistance, at twelve o'clock M. of
Thursday, February 28th, in raising the Tornado and placing
her in a position of safety. The efficient work of pumping out
the Tornado was done between 6 A.m. and 12 m. of February
28th. The said pumping service was done without serious danger to the tow-boats by which it was rendered. The total valuation of the property saved was $140,090.75. The value of the
tow-boats in the aggregate was $75,000 ; and their daily expenses
were each $100, when actually at work. The usual charge made
by tugsin the porf of New Orleans is from $6 to $12 per hour for
pumping. The said tow-boats remained alongside the Tornado after she was raised, ready to render her assistance in case
it was needed, for the period of about twelve days, but such
attendance was unnecessary and not required by any peril of the
Tornado and cargo, and the fire department of the city was
also at hand ready to extinguish a fire in the Tornado should

it again break out. The three tow-boats of the appellants, at the
time of making the contract, were out of service, laid up on the
other side of the river, without crews or provisions, but were
immediately manned and victqalled and brought over and laid
alongside of the Tbrnado in the afternoon of Wednesday, the
27th of February. At that time there were no other tow-boats
alongside of the Tornado. The said tow-boats were provided
with machinery and pumps for extinguishing fires and pumping
out sunken ships."
The circuit court found the following conclusions of law from
these facts: 1. The contract made by the master and agent of
the Tornado for pumping her out was inequitable, and ought
not, under the facts of the case, to be enforced. 2. The service
rendered by the three tow-boats was a salvage service, but one
of low grade. 3. Each of them should be allowed $1,000. 4.
The costs'of the appeal should be paid out of the fund in the
registry. The decree was that the owners of each tug recover
.$1,000 from the fund in the registry, and that the costs of the
appeal be paid out of that fund.

delivered the opinion of the court.

After stating the facts as above set forth, he continued:
The sole question to be considered on the appeal of the appellants is, whether the amounts which the circuit court awarded
to them severally, as owners of the three steam-tugs, should'be
increased.-- The errors* assigned by the appellants are (1) that
the circuit court held that the contract for pumping out the
ship was inequitable, and ought not, under the facts of the case,
to be enforced; (2) that it held that the salvage service was of
a low grade; (3) that it allowed to each boat only $1,000.
These are all assigned as errors in conclusions of law. There
is no complaint made by the libellants of the conclusion of law
that the service was a salvage service.
In the case of The Connemara, 108 U. S., this court said:

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

"The services performed being salvage services, the amount
of salvage to be awarded, although stated by the circuit court in
the form of a conclusion of law, is largely a matter of fact and
discretion, which cannot be reduced to precise rules, but depends
upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each case."
We are of opinion, that no ground is shown, on the facts
found, for awarding a larger sum to the appellants than the
circuit court allowed them. The contract, as found, was a
contract made by the master and the agent of the ship with the
association to which the three tugs belonged, "to pump out"
the ship, for a compensation of $50 per hour for each boat, "to
be continued until the boats were discharged." This does not
give a very clear idea as to what the contract was. If the
pumping out should be completed, there could be no continuance of the service of pumping out the ship, or of the contract
to pump out the ship. If the contract was, that the compensation named sLoud continue, in any event, and whether the ship
was pumped out or not, until the boat should be discharged,
the attendance of the boats alongside of the ship, after she was
pumped out and raised and placed in a position of safety, the
boats being ready to render assistance, in case it was needed,
for a period of about twelve days, is found to have been unnecessary. and not required by any peril of the Tornado and cargo.
It is not found, as a fact, that the boats were formally discharged by the master or agent of the ship. But it is foundthat
after the contract was made, and while the ship still lay at the
bottom of the river, and when the boats were about to begin
to pump her out, the marshal seized the ship and cargo under
a warrant on a. libel for salvage filed against the ship and
cargo, and took possession of the ship, and displaced the
authority of the master, but permitted the boats to proceed and
pump out the ship, and that they, with other assistance,
pumped out the ship and raised her and placed her in a position of safety by a pumping service of about eighteen hours.
It is not found that the marshal requested or sanctioned in any
way the continued presence of the tugs after the ship was
raised and made safe. The authority of the master was displaced by the marshal. On these facts we are of opinion that

to enforce the contract as one continuing during the time
claimed by the libellants would be highly inequitable; and
that, as against the insurers of the cargo, the right of the
boats to compensation must be regarded as having terminated when the ship and cargo were raised, and the boats
must be regarded as having been then discharged, within any
fair interpretation which can be given to the contract. A compensation of $50 per hour for the eighteen hours of actual

pumping would amount to $900.

Every agreement for salvage

compensation is subject, as to amount, to the judgment of the
court as to its being equitable and conformable to the merits
of the case. Parsons on Shipping, 306; Tite Helen and George,
Swabey, 368; Jones on Salvage, 94 et seq.
The final decree of the circuit court was entered on the 24th
of Nay, 1880. On the 26th of June following, the underwriters
on the cargo filed a petition in the circuit court praying a
cross-appeal to thiis court from the decree, and it was allowed,
returnable at the October term, 1880. On the 5th of July following, the bond on the cross-appeal was filed in the circuit
court. But the appellants in the cross-appeal did not docket it
or enter their appearance on it, in this court, until September
27th, 1883; and the appellees in it are entitled to have it dismissed. Grigsby v. Purcell, 99 U. S. 505; Tlte S. S. Osborne,
