S. C. to be held, used, and enjoyed by him, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever, with the hope and trust, however, that he
will not diminish the same to a greater extent than may be necessary for
his comfortable support and maintenance, and that, at his death, the
same, or so much thereof as he shall not have disposed of by devise or

A. with no remainder to B.

The pleadings and evidence in this case disclose the following facts: On March 18th, 1872, Lewis Carusi, a bachelor
about 78 years of age, and a citizen of the city of Washington,
in the District of Columbia, being seized in fee of certain real
estate in said city, executed his last will and testament. In
the first item of the will he directed his just debts and funeral
expenses to be paid out of his personal estate. The second
item of the will was as follows:

Statement of Facts.
"And as to all my property, real, personal, and mixed, after the
payment of my just debts aid funeral charges as aforesaid and the
payment of the legacies hereinafter mentioned, I give, devise, and
bequeath the same to my brother Samuel Carusi, to be held, used,
and enjoyed by him, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns forever, with the hope and trust, however, that he will not
diminish the same to a greater extent than may be necessary for
his comfort-able support and maintenance, and that at his death,
the same, or so much thereof as he, the said Samuel Carusi, shall
not have disposed of by devise or sale, shall descend to my three
beloved nieces, Phillippa Estelle Caulfield, nie Carusi, Genevieve
E. Carusi, and Isolina E. Carusi, the daughters of my said brother
Samuel Carusi, as follows: To the said Phillippa Estelle Caulfield, nre Carusi, the"sum of five thousand -dollars ($5,000), the remainder of my estate to be divided between Genevieve E. Carusi
and Isolina E. Carusi, to share and share alike as tenants in common and not as joint tenants, and so that they, and they alone,
shall have the right to have, possess, use, and enjoy the same separate and apart from and independent of any husband either one
of them may have at the time of my decease or"at any time thereafter, and so that he or they shall have no right, privilege, or
.power to control or interfere with any part of my sdid estate in
any mannex whatsoever, and so that the same shall nqt-be subject
or liable to any debt that any such husband may have-incurred.
"I further hope, trust, and desire that in-the event either one
of my said nieces, daughters of the said Samuel Carusi, shall not
survive my said brother Samuel, that the share she might become
entitled to had she survived him may be conferred and fall to the
surviving niece or nieces. In no event shall any portion of my
estate be subject to the control or interference of any husband
either one of my said nieces may have at the time of my decease
or at any time thereafter.
(FI give and devise to my three nieces, dautgliters of my brother
Nathaniel Carusi, the sum of two thousand dollhrs ($2,000.)"
By the third and last item of the will the testator appointed
his brother, Samuel Qarusi, the sole executor thereof.

Afterwards, on July lSth, 1872, the said Lewis Carusi, as
party of the first part, executed a deed of that date which piurported to convey to his brother, Samuel Carusi, party of the

second part, in fee simple, all his real estate in the city of
Washington, upon trusts which were thus exl)ressed:
"In trust nevertheless to, for, and upon the following uses and
trusts, that is to say, in trust to sell and convey the whole or any
part of the said pieces or parcels of ground and premises at the
discretion of the said party of the second part, and to invest the
moneys arising out of such sale or sales in other property or securities for the use and benefit of the said party of the first part.;
and in the event of the death of the said party of the first part, so
much of said pieces or parcels of ground as may remain unsold,

or such other property as may be purchased, or such securities as
may be acquired, in manner aforesaid, to convey to such person
or persons as the said party of the first part may, by his last will
and testament or other paper-writing, under his hand and seal, by
two persons witnessed, designate and direct."
The appellant averred, and the defendants denied, that this
deed had been delivered by the grantor to the grantee therein
named.
Subsequently, on October 17th, 1872, Lewis Carusi executed
and delivered to his brother, Samuel Carusi, another deed, conveying to him absolutely in fee simple the same lands described
in said will and in the deed of July 18, reserving to himself the
rents and profits thereof during his life.
On October 25th, 1872, Lewis Carusi died, having made no
will other than that of March 18th, 1872, above mentioned.
After the death of Lewis, Samuel Carusi took possession of the
real estate described in said will and deeds, claiming an absolute title in fee simple thereto by virtue of said will and the
deed of October 17th, 1872, and continued in possession until
his death. On March 23d, 1877, he duly executed his last will
and testament, by which he devised to his wife, Adelaide S.
Carusi, for her natural life all his real estate, with remainder
in fee at her death to his children, John McLean Carusi, Samuel P. Carusi, Thornton Carusi, Estelle Caulfield, Genevieve
Carusi, and Isolina E. Howard, share and share alike, and ap-.
pointed his wife, the said Adelaide S., and his son, the said
John McLean Carusi, the executors thereof.

Statement of Facts.

Afterwards, on December 22d, 1877, Samuel Carusi died,
and on January 8th, 1878, his. will was admitted to probate
and record in the Orphans Court of the District of Columbia.
The bill in this case was fied by Isolina E. Howara, one of
the children and heirs at law of Samuel Carusi, against the defendants, who were her brothers anad sisters and devisees under
their said father's will. It averred the making by Lewis Carusi
of his said will and of the deeds of July 18th and October 17th,
1872, and specially averred the delivery by Lewis Carusi to his
brother Samuel of the first-mentioned deed. It averred that
the deed of October 17th, 1879, was made by Lewis Carusi
when he was, physically so feeble as to be unable to sign his
name, "1and when he was mentally incompetent to execute a
deed; that at the time said deed was made by him he had no
legal title to the real estate* therein described, having divested
himself thereof by the deed of trust of July 18th, 1872, and
that he was procured to make said deed of October 17th by
Samuel Carusi, for whose benefit it was made."
The bill further alleged that the will of Lewis Carusi was
propounded for probate and record in the proper court, but a
caveat having been filed against the probate thereof, no proceedings were taken or decree made in reference thereto.
The bill charged that the will of ,Lewis Carusi fully designated the beneficiaries of the trusts created by the deed of trust
of July 18th, 1872, and that Samuel Carusi had no estate in the
property belonging to Lewis Carusi which he could dispose of
by his last will so as to divest the plaintiff and her sisters of
their rights under the last will and testament of Lewis Carusi
and that Samuel Carusi was only a trustee to hold the property
during the lifetime of Lewis Carusi, and upon trust to convey
the same upon the death of Lewis to the complainant and hvr
sisters in manner set forth in Lewis Carusi's last will and in
saiddeed:'of trust.
The bill further alleged that Samuel Carusi, with the purpose
of defeating the provisions of the will and deed of trust executed
by Lewis Carusi, did, during his own lifetime, suppress the deed
of trust and claimed an absolute title in fee simple to all the
estate of Lewis Carusi under the will of the latter and the. deed

of October 17th, 1872. Finally, the bill alleged that Lewis
Carusi, during his lifetime, repeatedly
"Declared, in most finmistakable terms, that it was his intention to leave his estate, by any testamentary dispositidn he should
make thereof, to his nieces, to the -exclusion entirely' of .any
nephews that might survive him, and to the exclusion of the wife
and
of the said Samuel Carusi, should she survive him;
that it was the intention of Lewis Carusi to make provision at all
events for his said several nieces in preference to all persons and
to every person who might, by reason of affinity, have any claim
upon him or his estate."

The bill prayed for a. decree declaring the deed of trust dated
July 18th, 1872, to be in full force and .effect, and that the will

of Lewis Carusi was operative as designating the beneficiaries
under the deed of trust, and its terms and conditions; that the
will of Samuel Carusi, so far as it devises any part of the estate
of which Lewis Carusi died seized, might be declared null and
void; that a receiver might be appointed to take charge of and
manage the estate, and that the defendants, Adelaide S. Carusi.
and John'IfcLean Carus, named as executors of the will of
Samuel Carusi, might be enjoined from interfering in any way
with the estate of Samuel Carusi, and for general relief.

MR. JusTrcmE Woos delivered the opinion. of the court.
The case made by the bill of complaint is based on the will
of Samuel Carusi, and upon the deed of trust alleged to have
been executed and delivered July 18th, 1872. The contention
of complainant -is that, by the deed Lewis Carusi conveyed to
Samuel Carusi all his real estate in trust to convey the same to
such person or persons as the said Lewis Carusi might, "by his
last will and testament, or other paper writing under his hand
a-id seal, by two persons witnessed, designate and direct;" and
that although the will was= revoked by the truit deed, it was
nevertheless effectual as a desighation of the persons to'whoqi

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

said real estate was to be conveyed by Samuel Carusi, the
trustee; and that the complainant and her sister, Genevieve
Carusi, were the persons who were so designated by the will.
It is clear, therefore, that complainant's case can derive no aid
from the declarations of the testator, Lewis Carusi, alleged to
have been made before and after the execution of his will, in relation to the disposition which he intended to make of his property. It must stand or fall upon the designation made in the will.
It is clear, also, that the will is to receive precisely the same
construction, as an instrument designating the beneficiaries of
the trust deed, as it would have received as a last will duly
proven and recorded. The question is, therefore, what estate
did the testator intend to give the complainant by his will of
March 18th, 1872?
This will gives, fnrst, an estate in fee simple to Samuel Carusi;
it contains, second, the expression of a hope and trust that he
will not unnecessarily diminish the estate; and, third, it gives
to the nieces of the testator so much of his estate as Samuel
Carusi shall not at his death have disposed of by sale or devise.
We have, then, devised to Samuel Carusi an estate in fee simple,
with an absolute power of disposition either by sale or devise
clearly and unmistakably implied. Therefore, according to
the adjudged cases, the limitation over to the nieces of the testator is void.
The rule is well established that, although generally an estate
may bedevised to one in fee simple or fee tail, with a limitation over by way of executory devise, yet when the will shows
a clear purpose of the-testator to give an absolute power of disposition to the first taker, the limitation over is void.
Thus, in the case of Attorney-General v. .all, Fitg-G. 314,
there was a devise of real and personal estate to the testator's
son and to the heirs of his body, and that if he should die
leaving no heirs of his body, then so much of the real and personal estate as he should be possessed of at his death was devised over to the complainants in trust. The son in his lifetime
suffered a common recovery of the real estate, and made a will
as to the personal estate, and died without issue, and a bill was
filed against his executor to account. It was held by Lord

HOWARD v. CARUSI.
Opinion of the Court.

Chancellor King, aided by the master of the rolls and the chief
baron of the exchequer, that the devisee was tenant in tail of
the real estate, and had barred the plaintiffs by the common
recovery, anid that the xecutrix was not to account for the personal estate to the persons claiming under the limitation, for
that was void as repugmant to the absolute ownership and
power of disposal given by the will
In the case of Ro88 v. Ros, 1 Jac. & Walker, 154, a limitation over was declared void because it was limited upon the
contingency that the first taker did not dispose of the property
by will or otherwise: See also Cuthbert v. Purrier,.ac. 415;
Bourn v. G,085, I Russ. & Myhne, 614; .Hotmes v. Godson, 8
DeG. M. & G. 152.
The American cases are to the same effect. Thus, in Jack8on v. Bull, 10 Johns. 18, Charles Bull died seized of the premises in question. By his last will, after devising a certain lot
of land to his son Moses, he declared: "In case my son Moses
should die without lawful issue, the said property he died possessed of I will to my son Young, his lawful issue," &c. It
was held that the limitation over was void as being repugnant
to the absolute control over the estate which the testator intended to give.
In Ide v. Ide, 5 Mass. 500, the devise was to the testator's
son Peleg, his heirs and assigns, with the following provision:
" And further, it is my will that if my son Peleg shall die and
leave no lawful heirs, what estate he shall leave to be equally
divided between' my son John Ide and my grandson Nathaniel
Ide, to them and their heirs forever." Held that his limitation
over to John and Nathaiiel Ide was void because inconsistent
with the absolute unqualified interest in the first devisee.
To the same effect is the case of Bowen v. Dean, 110 Mass.
432, where a man devised all his estate, real and personal, to
his wife, "to hold to her and her assigns," but should she "die
intestate and seized of any portion of said estate at the time of
her.death}" then over. The wife took possession of the land
and died having made a- will by which she devised and bequeathed all her estate, real and personal. It was held, that
the will of the husband gave the wife, by necessary implica

Opinion of the Court.

tion, an absolute power of disposal, either by deed or will, and
this power having been fully executed by her will, nothing remained upon which the devise over in the will of her husband
could operate.
In .Odso v. Cooper, 4 Leigh, 408, the case was this: John
Cooper died in 1813 seized of the messuage and land in controversy, having, by his last will duly executed, devised, inter alia,
as follows: "I give to my son, William Cooper, the plantation
I live on, to him, and his heirs forever. In case he should die
without a son and not sell the land, I give the land to my son,
George," &c. The plantation on which the testator lived was
the land in controversy. George Cooper, the lessee of the
plaintiff, was the testator's son George mentioned in the devise,
who claimed the land under the limitation over to him therein
contained. The testator's son-William, to whom the land was
devised in the first instance, attained to full age, married, and
died, leaving issue one daughter, but without leaving or ever
having had a sqn, and without having sold the lInd. The'question referred to the court was whether, upon this state of facts,
George Cooper was entitled to the land. The court held that
a general, absolute, unlimited power to sell the land was given
to William Cooper by the devise, and he took a fee simple, and
that George Cooper was not entitled to recover. See also
Giffrd v. Noate, 100 Afass. 343; Hale v. .2arsJ, Ib. 468;
1?amsdell v. Ramsdell, 21 Me. 288.
The rule is thus stated by Chancellor Kent: "If there be an
absolute power of disposition -given by the will to the first
taker, as if an estate be. devised to A in fee, and if he dies
possessed of the property without lawful issue, the remainder
over, .or remainder over of the property which he, dying without heirs, should leave, or without selling or devising the same;
in all such cases the remainder over is void as a remainder because of the preceding fee; and it is void by way of executory
devise, because the limitation is inconsistent with the absolute
estate, or power of disposition expressly given, or necessarily
implied by the will." 4 Kent's Com., 271.
If the will of Lewis Carusi had remained unrevoked and had
been duly proven and recorded, and Samuel Carusi had died

HOWARD v. CAR USI.
Opinion of the Court.

intestate, with all the property devised to him by Lewis Carusi
undisposed of, the complainant would be entitled to no relief,
for she would have taken nothing by the will. If the w'll can
be held to degignate any beneficiary under the trust deed of
July 18th, 1872, it designated Samuel Carusi and not the complainant and her sisters.
But by the terms of Lewis Carusi's will, the complainant
and her sisters were only entitled to so much of the estate of
Lewis as Samuel should "not have disposed of by devise or
sale." The bill of complaint charges that Samuel Ca'rusi, by
his last will and testament, had devised to certain persons
therein named, among them the complainant, all the property
devised to, him by the last will of Lewis Carusi. There was,
therefore, no property of the estate of Lewis Carusi to which
the supposed devise to complainant and her sisters could apply.
The case of complainant receives no support from the precatory words of the will of Lewis Carusi. These words express
"the hope and trust that Samuel Carusi will not diminish the
same (viz., the property devised.to him by the will) to a greater
extent than may answer for his comfortable support," and the
testator then devises to complainant and her sisters what Samuel shall not have disposed of by devise or sale.
The words do not raise any trust in Samuel. He is not made
a tr:ustee for .any purpose, and no duty in respect to the disposition of the estate is imposed upon him. But even if the will
had contained an express request that Samuel should cofivey
to the complainant so much of the estate as he did not dispose
of by sale or devise, there would be no trust, for the will, as
we have seen, gives Samuel Carusi the absolute power of disposal.
In ZT ight v. Znig/t, 3 Beavan, 148, t was said by the :Master of the Rolls (Lord Langdale):
"If the giver accompanies his expression of wish or request by
other words, from which it is to be collected that he did niot intend
the wish to be imperative, or if it appears from the context that
the first taker was to have a discretionary power to withdraw any
part of the subject from the ish or request,
it has been
held that no trust was created."

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

And see S. C. nom. Rnhight v. Boughton, 11 Cl. & Fin. 513.
The rule is thus stated by Mr. Justice Story in his Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence, § 1070:
"Whenever the objects of the supposed recommendatory trust
are not certain or definite, whenever the property to which it is to
attach is not certain or definite, whenever a clear discretion

or choice to act or not to act is given, whenever the prior dispositions of the property import absolute and uncontrollable ownership, in all such cases courts of equity will not create a trust from
words of this character."

Atkyns," Turn. & Russ. 143; S'ead v. 3Iellor, 5 Ch.D. 225;

Eq. Jur. §§ 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017, and notes.
The views we have expressed render it unnecessary to consider other questions argued by counsel. It is quite immaterial
whether or not Lewis Carusi had mental capacity to execute
the deed of October 17th, 1872, or -,-hether he had any title
to the property described therein. If that deed had never
been executed the fact would not aid the complainant's case.
The result is that the decree of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia in general term by which the decree of
the special term dismissing the complainant's bill was affirmed
was right, and must itself be
