ConstitutionalLaw---Turis(iction--_Practica-wng' ,State..
1. The State of Georgia indorsed the bonds of a railroad company, taking a
lien upon the railroad as security-. The company failing to pay interest
upon the indorsed bonds, the governor of the State took possession of
the road, and put it into the hands of a receiver, who made sale of it to
the State. The- State then toole'possession. of it, and took up the indorsed bonds, substituting the. bonds- of the State in their place. The
holders of an-issue of mortgage" bonds- issued by the railroad company
subsequently to those indorsdd by the State, but before the default in
payment of interestk filed a bill in equity to foreclose- their own mortgage and to set aside the, said sale and to be let in as prior in lien, and
for other relief affecting the property, and. set forth the above facts, and
made the governor and the treasurer of the State parties. - Those officers
demurred - .2ed, that the facts in the bill show that the State is so interested in the property-that final relieftcannot be granted without making it a, party, and the court is without jurisdiction.
2. Whenever it is clearly seen that a State is an indispensable party to enable
the court, according to the rules which govern its procedure, to grant
the relief sought, it will refuse to take jurisdiction..
3. The cases at law and in equity in which-- the court has taken jurisdiction,
when the objection has been interposed that a State was a necessary
party-ta enable the court to grant relief, examined and classified.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. liford

and .Ar. Jose.ph ff. Choae for appel-

lees.
MR. JusTicE MLtzn delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of Georgia, dismissing the bill of complainant
on demurrer.
The bill is filed by Cunningham, a citizen of the State of
Virginia, against Alfred H. Colquitt, as governor of the State
of Georgia, J. W. Renfroe, as treasurer of the State, the Macon
and Brunswick Railroad Company, and A. Flewellen, W. A.
Lofton, and George S. Jones, styling themselves directors of
said railroad company, John H. James, a citizen of Georgia,
and the First National Bank of Macon.
The bill sets out, with reasonable fulness and with references
to exhibits which make its statements clear, what we will try
to state, as far as necessary, in shorter terms.
It alleges that on the 3d day of December, 1866, the assembly of Georgia passed an act authorizing the governor to
indorse the bonds of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company to the extent of $10,000 per mile, and that under this
authority the governor indorsed bonds td the amount of
$1,950,000, which were afterwards negotiated by said company. The statute under which this was done made the indorsement of these bonds to operate as a prior mortgage upon
all the property of the company, which could be enforced by a
sale by the governor upon default in payment of the bonds so
indorsed, or interest on them as it fell due. In addition to this
the company executed and delivered to the governor, on the
22d of June, 1870, a written mortgage confirming the lien
created by the statute, which was duly acknowledged and recorded.
October 27th, 1870, the legislature, by an act amending the
act of December 3d, 1866, authorized the governor to indorse
an additional $3,000 per mile of the bonds of the company,
which was done, and of this series of bonds the complainant
became the holder and owner of nineteen for $1i000 each.
It is then alleged that on July 1st, 1 73, the company failed

OCTOBER TERMI, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

to pay its interest coupons upon both these sets of indorsed
bonds, and that in a few days thereafter the governor, under
the power vested in him by the act of 1866, took possession of
the road and the property of the company and placed them in
the hands of Flewellen as receiver; and that on the first Tuesday in June, 1875, he sold said road to the State of Georgia for
the sum of $1,000,000, and made a conveyance of it to the
State accordingly, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the
bill. It.is also alleged that the State of Georgia has taken up
since that time the entire issue of $1,950,000, giving her own
bonds in place of the bonds which she had so indorsed.
The bill assails this transaction because the governor, in advertising the sale, gave notice that he would accept in payment
for bids bonds of the State at par, or bonds of the first series of
$1,950,000 at their market value, or cash, and would not receive any of the second series of $600,000 in payment. Also
because the sale was made improvidently, at a bad time, as the
governor was informed by his agent, Flewellen, and because
the governor was not authorized to bid for the property, and
the State had no constitutional power to make the purchase.
And it is furthr alleged that if the sale is not absolutely
void, it is voidable, because under the statutory and executed
mortgages the State is trustee of the property mortgaged for
the benefit of the bondholders, and her purchase can be set
aside by the beneficiaries under the trust when they elect to do
so. The bill insists that by the taking up and payment of the
first series of indorsed bonds their lien on the property is extinguished, and that of the second series is now become paramount, and this suit is brought to foreclose that mortgage lien.
And if the court shall be of opinion that the sale was valid,
then the bill insists that the holders of the second series were
entitled to be paidpro Tata under that sale, and that when thc
legislature of Georgia appropriates any money to pay the bonds
which it gave in exchange for $1,950,000 of the indorsed railroad bonds, the amount so appropriated should be' divided pro
Tata between these bonds and the $600,000 of the second series
of indorsed bonds.
The prayer of the bill is for the appointment of a receiver

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 449
Opinion of the Court.

to whom all the property of the company shall be delivered;
that the mortgage be foreclosed and the proceeds applied to
payment of the bonds of the second series so far as necessary
for that purpose; or, if the court shall be of opinion that
the sale was valid, that Renfroe be enjoined from paying
the coupons of interest on the State bonds exchanged for
the first series of bonds, and that the holders thereof be
made parties to the suit, and be compelled to account to
the holders of the $600,000 series of bonds for their pro
rata share of said exchanged bonds; and the bill prays
that Colquitt, the governor, and Renfroe, the treasurer,
and the three directors of the company, be compelled by
subpcena to appear and answer it and certain interrogatories in it, and produce certain papers; ahd that Renfroe be
enjoined from paying the coupons on the State bonds exchanged for the indorsed bonds; and that the State of Georgia
may come in and make herself a party defendant to this bill if she
should wish to do so; and there is a prayer for general relief.
To this bill there was filed by Flewellen, lofton, and Xones,
the directors, a demurrer and plea, as it is called. The plea is
to the effect that they have no interest in the road otherwise
than as agents of the State of Georgia, for which they hold
and control the Macon and Brunswick Railroad and all its
property and franchises of every description, and the plea and
demurrer both rely on the proposition that the court has no
jurisdiction of the case, because it cannot proceed without the
State as a party, and that the court cannot compel the State to
become a party to the suit.
Renfroe, the treasurer, filed a similar plea, and Colquitt, the
governor, fied a demurrer and a plea separately.
The ground of demurrer stated by the governor is that it is
apparent on the face of the bill that the court cannot take cognizance of the matters and things set up in said bill as against
the defendant, because it appears that he has no personal interest in the same, but that it is an attempt to make the State of
Georgia a party to the suit through the defendant as governor,
so as to bind the State by the judgment and decision of the
court in the case.
VOL. cIX-29

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

On this demurrer of Colquitt and the joint demurrer of the
three trustees the case was decided and the bill dismissed.
Mr. Justice Woods in dismissing it said:
"The bill is to all intents and purposes a suit against the State.
It is mainly her property, and not that of Alfred H. Colquitt or
J. W. Renfroe, that is to be affected by the decree of this court.
It is the-title of the State that is assailed. The attack is not made
against the State directly, but through her officers. This indirect
way of making the? State a party is just as open to objection as if
the State had been named as a defendant." 3 Wood's R. 426.
The failure of several of the States bf the Union to pay the
debts which they have contracted and to discharge other obligations of a contract character, when taken in connection with
the acknowledged principle that no State can be sued in the
otdinary courts as a defendant except by her own consent, has
led, in recent times, to numerous efforts to compel the performance of their obligations by judicial proceedings to which the
State is not a party.
These suits have generally been instituted in the circuit
courts of the United States, or have been removed into them
from the State courts.
The original jurisdiction of this court has also been invoked
in the recent cases of' The State of New Hampshire v. The
State of Loui iana and The State of New York v. The State of
Loui&sia , 108 U. S. 6. Th~se latter suits were based on the
proposition that the constitutional provision that States might
sue each other in this court would enable a State whose citizens were owners of obligations of Anbther State to take a
transfer of those obligations to herself and sue the defaulting
State in the court. The doctrine was overruled in those cases
at the last term by the unanimous opinion of the court.
In the suits which have been instituted in the circuit courts
the effort has been, while acknowledging the incapacity of
those couits to assume jurisdiction of a State as a party, to
proceed in such a manner against-the officers or agents of the

State government, or agai"t property of the State in their

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 451
Opinion of the Court.

hands, that relief can be had without making the State a
party.
The same principle of exemption from liability to suit as applied to the government of the United States has led to like
efforts to enforce rights against the government in a similar
manner. And it must be confessed that, in regard to both
classes of cases, the questions raised have rarely been free from
difficulty, and the judges of this court have not always been
able to agree in regard to them. Nor is it an eask matter to
reconcile all the decisions of the court in this class of cases.
While no attempt will be made here to do this, it may not
be amiss to try to deduce from them some general principles,
sufficient to decide the case before us.
It may be accepted as a point of departure unquestioned,
that neither a State nor the United States can be sued as defendant in any court in this country without their consent,
except in the limited class of cases in which a State may be
made a party in the Supreme Court of the U nited States by
virtue of the original jurisdiction conferred on this court by the
Constitution.
This principle is conceded in all the cases, and whenever it
can be clearly seen that the State is an indispensable party to
enable the court, according to the rules which govern its procedure, to grant the relief sought, it will refuse to take jurisdiction. But in the desire to do that justice, which in many
cases the courts can see ill be defeated by an unwarranted
extension of this principle, they have in some ifistances gone a
long way in holding the State not to be a necessary party,
though some interest of hers may be more or less affected by
the decision. In many of these cases the action of the court
has been based upon principles whose soundness cannot be
disputed. A reference to a few of them may enlighten us in
regard to the case now under consideration.
1. It has been held in a class of cases where property of the
State, or property in which the State has an interest, comes
before the court and under its control, in the regular course of
judicial administration, -without being forcibly taken from the
possession of the government, the court will proceed to discharge

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

its duty in regard to that property. And the State, if it choose
to, come in as plaintiff, as in prize cases, or to intervene in other
cases when she may have a lien or other claim on the property, will be permitted to do so, but subject to the rule that
her rights will receive the same consideration as any other
party interested in the matter, and be subjected in like manner
to the judgment of the court. Of this class are the cases of
Th Siren, 7 Wall, 152, 157 ; ihe Davis, 10 Wall. 15, 20; and
Clar-V. Barnardand others, 108 U. S.
'2. Another class of cases is where-an individual is sued in tort
for some act injurious to another in regard to person or prop(erty, to which his defence is that he has acted under the orders
of the government.
In these cases he is not sued as, or because he is, the officer
of the government, but as an individual, and the court is not
ousted of juriediction because he asserts authority as such officer.
To make out his defence he must show that his authority was
sufficient in law to protect him. See IitcAell v. Hamony, 13
How. 115 ; Bates v. Clark, 95 U. S. 204; Meigs v. .AhOlung,
9 Cranch, 11; Vllcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498; Brown v.
HMuger, 21 How. 305; Grsarv. .2WcDowell, 6 Wall. 363.
To this class belongs also the recent case of United State8 v.
Lee, 106 U. S. 196, for the action of ejectment in that case is,
in its essential character, an action of trespass, with the power
-in the court to restore the possession to the plaintiff as part of
the judgment. And the defendants, Strong and Kaufman, being
sued individually as trespassers, set up their authority as officers
of the United States, which this court held to be unlawful, and
therefore' insufficient as a defence. The judgment in that case
did not conclude the United States, as the opinion carefully
stated, but held the officers liable as unauthorized trespassers,
and turned them out of their unlawtul possession.
3. A third class, whch has given rise to more controversy, is
where the law has imposed upon an. officer of the government
a well defined duty in regard to a specific matter, not affecting
the general powers or functions of the government, but in the
performance of which one or more individuals have a distinct
interest capable of enforcement by judicial process.

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 453
Opinion of the Curt.

Of this class are writs of mandamus to public officers, as in
.ar~nury v. Xadison, 1 Cranch, 137; Kendaxl v. Stokes, 3
How. 87; United States v. Slhurtz, 102 U. S. 378; United
States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall 604.
But in all such cases, from the nature of the remedy by mandamus, the duty to be performed must be merely ministerial,
and must involve no element of discretion to be exercised by
the officer.
It has, however, been much insisted on that in this class of
cases, where it shall be found necessary to enforce the rights of
the individual, a court of chancery may, by a mandatory decree or by an injunction, compel the performance of the appropriate duty, or enjoin the officer from doing that which i
inconsistent with that duty and with plaintiff's rights in th6
premises.
Perhaps the strongest assertion of this doctrine is found in
the case of Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall 203.
In that case, the State of Texas having made a grant of the
alternate sections of land along which a railroad should thereaft&r be located, and the railroad company having surveyed the
land at its own expense and located its road through it, the commissioner of the State land office and the governor of the State
were, in. violation of the rights of the company, selling and
delivering patents for the sections to, which the company had
an undoubted vested. right. The cirquit court enjoined them
from doing this by its decree, which was affirmed in this court.
Judge Hunt did not sit in the case, and Justice Davis and
Chief Justice Chase dissented, on the ground that it was in
effect a suit against the State. Though there are some -expressions in the opinion which are unfavorably criticised in thE
opinions of both the majority and minority of this court in the
recent case of United States v. Lee, the action of the court has
not been overruled.
But it is clear that in enjoining the governor of the State in
the performance of one of his executive functions, the case goes
to the verge of sound doctrine, if not beyond it, and that the
principle should be extended no further. Nor was there in
that case any affirmative relief granted by ordering the gov-

OCTOBER TERAI, 1383.
Opinion of the Court.

ernor and land commissioner to perform any act towards perfecting the title of the company.

The case of theBoard of Liquidation v. ._WComb, 92 U. S.
531, is to the same effect. The board of liquidation was charged
by the statute of Louisiana with certain duties in regard to issuing new bonds of the State in place of old ones which might
be surrendered for exchange by the holders of the latter. The
amount of new bonds to be issued was limited by a constitutional provision. ]McoComb, the owner of some of the new
bonds already issued, filed his bill to restrain the board from
issuing that class of bonds in exchange for a class 6f indebtedness not included within the purview of the statute, on the
ground that his own bonds would thereby be rendered less valuable. This court affirmed the decree of the circuit court enjoining the bQard from exceeding its power in taking up by the
new issue a class of State indebtedness not within the provisions
of the law on that subject.
In the opinion in that case the language used by Mr. Justice
Bradley well and tersely thus expresses the rule and its limitations:
"The objections- to proceeding against State officers by mandamus or injunction are,- first, that it is in effect proceeding
against the State itself ; and, second, that it interferes with the
official discretion vested in the officers. It is conceded that
neither of these can be done. A State, without its consent, cannot be sued as an individual; and a court cannot substitute its
own discretion for that of executive officers, in matters belonging
to the proper jurisdiction of the latter. But it has been settled
that where a plain official duty requiring no exercise of discretion
is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who
will sustain a personal injury by such refusal may have a mandamus to compel performance; and when such duty is threatened
to be violated 'by some positive official act, any person who will
sustain personal injury thereby, for which adequate compensation
cannot be had at law, may have an injunction to prevent it."
It is believed that this is as far as this court has gone in
granting relief in this class of cases. The case of Osbo'ne v.

CUNNINGttA

v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 455
Opinion of the Court.

Bank of the United State8, 9 Wheat. 738, often referred to,
was decided upon this principle, and goes no further; for, in
that case, a preliminary injunction of the court forbidding a
State officer from placing the money of the bank, which he had
seized, in the treasury of the State, having been disregarded, the
final decree corrected this violation of the injunction, by requirixg the restoration of the money thus removed. See L aui6in
v. Jumez, 107 U. S. 711.
On the other hand, in the cases .of Iouifian v. JumeZ and
.Elliot v. Wltz, 107 U. S. 711, decided at the last term, very
ably argued and very fully considered, the court declined to go
any further.
rn the first of these cases the owners of the new bonds issued
by the board of liquidation mentioned in kvcComb's case, above
cited, brought the bill in equity, in the Circuit Court of the
United States, to compel the auditor of the State and the treasurer
of the State to pay, out of the treasury of the State, the overdue interest coupons on their bonds, and to enjoin them from
paying any part of the taxes collected for that purpose for the
ordinary expenses of the government. They at the same time
applied to the State court for a writ of mandamus to the same
officers, which suit was removed into the Circuit Court of the
United States. In this they asked that these officers be commanded to pay, out of the moneys in the treasury, the taxes
which they maintained had been assessed for the purpose of
paying the interest on their bonds, and to pay such sums as had already been diverted from that purpose to others by the
officers of the government.
The circuit court refused the relief asked in each case, and
this court affirmed the judgment of that court.
The short statement of the reason for this judgment is, that
as the State could not be sued or made a party to such proceeding, there was no jurisdiction in the circuit court either by
mandamus at law, or by a decree in chancery, to take charge
of the treasury of the State, and seizing the hands of the
auditor and treasurer, to make distribution of the funds found
in the treasury in the manner which the court might think

just.

OCTOBER TERM, 1-883.
Opinion of the Court.

The Chief Justice said:
"The treasurer of the State is the keeper of the money collected
-from this tax, just as he is the keeper of other public moneys.
The taxes were collected by the tax collectors and paid over to
him, that is to say, into the State treasury, just as other taxes
were when collected. He is no more a trustee of these moneys
than he is of all other public moneys. He holds them only as
agent of the State. If there is any trust the State is the trustee,
aiid unless the State can be sued the trustee cannot be enjoined.
* The officers owe duty to the State alone, and have no contract relations with the. bondholders.

They can only act as the State

directs them to act and hold as the State allows them to hold, It
was never agreed that their relations with the bondholders should
be other than as officers of the State, or that they should have any
control over this fund except to keep it like other funds in the
treasury, and pay it out according to law. They can be moved
through the State, but not the State through them.'
We ±hink the foregoing cases mark, with reasonable precision, the limit of the power of the courts in cases affecting the
rights of the State -or federal governments in suits to which
they are not voluntary parties.
In actions at law, of which mandamus is one, where an individual is sued, as for injuries to person or to property, real
or personal, or in regard to a duty which he is personally bound
to perform, the government does not stand behind him to defend him. If he has the authority of law to sustain him in what
he has done, ]ke any other defendant, he must show it to the
court and abide the result. In either case the State is not
bound by the judgment of the court, and generally its rights
remain unaffected. It is no answer for the defendant to say I
am an officer of the government and acted under its authority,
unless he shows the sufficiency of that authority.
Courts of equity proceed upon diferent principles in regard
to parties. As was said in Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280,
there are persons who are merely formal, parties without real
interest, and there are those who havefan iiterest in the suit,
but which will not be injured by the relief sought, and there

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 457
Opinion of the Court.

are those whose interest in the subject-matter of the suit renders
them indispensable as parties to it. Of this latter class the
court said, in SdeZd v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, "they are persons who not only have an interest in the controversy, but an
interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made
without affecting that interest or leaving the controversy in
such a condition that its final disposition may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience."
"In such cases," says the court in Barney v. Baltimore, 6
Wall. 280, "the court refuses to entertain the suit when these
parties cannot be subjected to its jurisdiction."
In the case now under consideration the State of Georgia
is an indispensable party. It is in fact the only proper defendant in the case. No one sued has any personal interest in the matter or any official authority to grant the relief
asked.
No foreclosure suit can be sustained without the State, because she has the legal title to the property, and the purchaser
under a foreclosure decree would get no title in the absence of
the State. The State is in the actual possession of the property,
and the court can deliver no possession to the purchaser. The
entire interest adverse to plaintiff in this suit is the interest of
the State of Georgia in the property, of which she has both the
title and possession.
On the hypothesis that the foreclosure by the governor was
valid, the trust asserted by plaintiff is vested in the State as
trustee, and not in any of the officers sued.
No money decree can be rendered against the State, nor
against its officers, nor any decree against the treasurer, as settled in Loui8iana v. Jumd.

If any branch of the State government has power to give
plaintiff relief it is the legislative. Why is it not -sued as a
body, or its members by mandamus, to compel them to provide
means to pay the State's indorsement?
The absurdity of this proposition shows the impossibility of
compelling a State to pay its debts by judieial process.
The decree of the circuit court i,9 ajirmed.

The bill in this suit was filed by Cunningham, a citizen of
Virginia, in behalf of himself and all holders of the second
series of the bonds of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad Company, indorsed by theState of Georgia, who may choose to be
made parties to the suit and share the expenses thereof.
The defendants are: The Macon and Brunswick Railroad
Company, a corporation of Georgia; Edward A. Flewellyn, W.
A. Lofton, and George S. Jones, citizens of Georgia, and styling
themselves "Directors of the Mvacon and Brunswick Railroad ;"
J. W. Renfroe, treasurer, and Alfred H. Colquitt, governor of
the State of Georgia, both citizens of that State; the First
National Bank of Macon, a corporation created under the laws
of the United States and located at Macon, Georgia, and John
H. James, a citizen of Georgia.
The suit relates to the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, of
which Flewellyn, Lofton, and Jones, as directors aforesaid, are
in possession, and which they are managing and operating in
-entire disregard; as the bill alleges, of the rights of complainant
and other holders of the before-mentioned bonds.
But the suit has other features of which no notice is taken in
the opinibn of the court. The bill alleges that on or about
July 2d, 1873, the then governor of Georgia not only seized the
railroad and all other property of the company, but certain
other property embraced in a deed of trust to one Whittle,
which was Mt covered by the statutory and executed mortgages, so far as the $1,950,000 series of indorsed bonds is concerned, becauae acquired by the company after the last of that
series had been indorsed, with funds other than the proceeds of
the bonds, but which was covered by the mortgages so far as
the $600,000 series is concerned, having been bought prior to
the indorsement of the latter bonds: The property covered by
the deed of trust to Whittle was, the bill alleges, transferred to
the trostees therein named, with directions to dispose of the
same and with the proceeds to redeem certain fare-bills of the
company; but said trust was never carried out by them, because
those fare-bills were fully paid out of the earnings of the railroad.

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 459.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, Field, JJ.

The bill charges that the sale at which the governor of
Georgia purchased the property for the State was void:
1. "Because neither the legislature nor the govbrnor had the
right to exclude the $600,000 series of indorsed bonds from being
used as so much cash, in the purchase of said road, at their face
value-certainly they were entitled to be so used, in the event of
the exhaustion of the $1,950,000, which themselves should have
been received as cash at par."
2. "Because the governor was not authorized to bid on said
property for the State, and the State had.no constitutional power
to make the purchase; or, if said sale is not void, it is certainly
voidable, because, under the statutory and executed mortgages,
the State is the trustee of the property mortgaged for the benefit
of the bondholders, and had no right to buy at her own sale, as
such trustee, without incurring the risk of having said sale set
aside at the instance of any beneficiary under the trust, and your
orator as such beneficiary, elects to set aside such sale."
The suit proceeds in part upon the general ground that the
mortgages in question are mortgages to the governor of
Georgia, as trustee for the bondholders, to secure the payment
of the bonds indorsed by the State, and not mortgages of indemnity to the State to save her harmless against the liability
incurred by her indorsement. If, however, the court should
be of opinion that the mortgages are for the indemnity of the
State, and that the sale of the railroad and purchase by the
State are valid, then the complainant insists that both series of
indorsed bonds stand upon an equal footing, and that the sums
paid by the treasurer of the State, in taking up the. coupons of
the State bonds which have been exchanged for the $1,950,000
series of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad indorsed bonds,
represent a portion of these proceeds, and should be paid 0ro
rata upon both series of bonds; and that when the legislature

The case went off in the court below on demurrers and pleas
which questioned the right of complainant to relief solely upon
-the ground that the suit was against the State, which i as not,
and could not be made, a party to the suit.
It is true, as stated in the opinion of the court, that the
property to which the suit relates is in the actual possession of
some of the defendants, who assert no individual claim thereto,
but are acting for and on behalf of the State. It is also true
that the apparent legal title to the property embraced by the
mortgages, other than such as was covered by the deed to
Whittle, stands in the name of the State. But the suit, as is
quite clear, proceeds upon the ground that Georgia, by her
officers, is not rightfully in possession, and that no valid title
passed to the State by virtue of the sale in question. The
issue is distinctly made by the bill, that the governor was not
authorized to bid in the property, and that the State hadL no
constitutional power to make the purchase. But the court
declines or fails to consider or pass upon these questions. If
the court had found that the sale under which the State.
claimed was valid, and that the governor had legal authority
to make the purchase in virtue of which the officers of the
State claim to be rightfully in possession in her behalf; or had
it been adjudged that the complainant and those united in
interest with him had no lien or claim upon the property, I
should not, perhaps, have expressed any dissent, however much
I mayhave differed with my brethren upon such questions. In
other words, if the State was ascertained to be the lawful
owner of and entitled to the possession of the property in
question, I should recognize the legal difficulties in the way of
enforcing a lien thereon for any purpose in behalf of others;
for the enforcement of such lien would, .in the case supposed,
necessarily disturb the rightful possession of the State, which
could not be sued against her will, and without whose presence
in the suit a final comprehensive decree could not be passed.
But such is not the case before us. The case to be determined is that made by the bill. Its avernents are admitted

by the demurrer and are not controverted by the pleas. They
show that the property, although held by officers of the State, as
her absolute property, is not rightfully so held. It is this aspect
of the present decision which constrains me to dissent from the.
opinion of the court. If the citizen asserts a claim or lien upon
property in the possession of officers of a State, the doors of
the courts of justice ought not to be closed against him, because those officers a8sert ownership in the State. The court
should examine the case so far as to determine whether the
State's title rests upon a legal foundation. If that title is found
to be insufficient, and if the State, claiming its constitutional exemption from suit, refuse to appear in the suit as a party of
record, the court ought to proceedto a final decree as betWeen the
complainant and those who are in possession of the property,
leaving the State to assert her claim in any suit she might bring.
This must be so, otherwise the citizen may be deprived of his
property and denied his legal rights, simply because the officers
of a State take possession of and hold it for the State.
Such was the ruling of this court in United Statev v. Lee, 106
U. S. 196. That was an action to recover the possession of
what was formerly known as the Arlington estate. The defendants held possession of the property in no other capacity
than as officers and agents of the United States. The attorney-general of the United States appeared, and in due form
gave the court, to understand that the property in controversy
was then, and for more than ten years had been, held, occupied,
and possessed by the United States, through their officers and
agents, as public property for public purposes, in the exercise
of their sovereign and constitutional powers, namely, as a military station, and as a national cemetery established for the
burial of deceased soldiers and sailors of the Union. Upon
these grounds it was contended that no action could be maintained which would disturb the control of those who were in
possession for the United States. The contention, in behalf of
the government, was that the United States could not be sued
without their consent, and that the maintenance of a suit
against their officers and agents for the purpose of ousting
them from the possession of the Arlington cemetery, would be

OCTOBER TERM,

an encroachment upon the powers entrusted by the Constitution to the legislative and executive departments.
But to this argument the response of this court was: That
under the American system of government the people, called
elsewhere subjects, were sovereign; that their "rights, whether
collective or individual, are not bound to give way to a sentiment of loyalty to the person of a monarch ;" that "the citizen here knows no person, however near to those in power, or
however powerful himself, to whom he need yield the rights
which the law secures to him when it is well administered ;"
that "when he, in one of the courts of competent jurisdiction,
has established his right to property, there is no reason why
deference to any person, natural or artificial, not even the
United States, should prevent him from using the means which
the law gives him for the protection and enforcement of that
right;" "that no man in this country is so high that he is above
the law; no officer of the law may set that law at defiance
with impunity; all the officers of the government, from the
highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound
to obey it." Upon examination of the doctrine that, except
where Congress has provided, the United States cannot be sued,
we held that it had no application to officers and agents of the
United States who, holding possession of property for public
uses, are sued therefor by a person claiming to be the owner
thereof or entitled thereto; but the lawfulness of that possession and the right or title of the United States to the property
may, by a court of competent jurisdiction, be the subject-matter
of the inquiry, and adjudged accordingly.
In the case just cited, we quoted, with approval, the language
of Chief Justice Marshall, in United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch
115, where, speaking for the court, he said that "it certainly can
never be alleged that a mere suggestion of title in a State to
property in possession of an individual must arrest the proceedings of the court, and prevent them looking into the suggestion
and examining the validity of the title."
In United States v. Zee, we also referred with approval to the
decision in Osborne v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738.
That was a suit by the Bank of the United States against the

CUNNINGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 463Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, Field, J.

auditor, treasurer, and other agents of the State of Ohio. The
State, by its officers, levied a tax upon the bank, which it refused to pay. The State officer seized the money of the bank
in payment of the tax, and delivered it to the treasurer of the
State. The latter held it when the suit was brought, and the
right of the State to hold the money in discharge of its taxes
was the fundamental question in the case. The State was not
made a party, because by the Constitution the judicial power
of the United States did not extend to a suit against one of the
United States by citizens of another State. It was conceded
that the State was the real party in interest. That of which
the bank complained were the acts of the defendants in their
official character, and done in obedience to the statutes of Ohio.
The contention, therefore, was, that as the State could not be
sued, the suit must be dismissed. But- to this the court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, replied:
"If the State of Ohio could have been made a party defendant,
it car scarcely be denied that this would be a strong case for an
injunction. The objection is that, as the real party cannot be
brought before the court, a suit cannot be sustained against the
agents of that party; and cases have been cited to-show that a
court of chancery will not make a decree unless all those who are
substantially interested be made parties to the suit. This is
certainly true where it is in the power of the plaintiff to make
them parties ; but if the person who is the real principal, the
person who is the true source of the mischief, by whose power and
for whose advantage it is done, be himself above the law, be
exempt from all judicial process, it would be subversive of the
best established principles to say that the laws could not afford
the same remedies against the agent employed in doing the wrong
which they would afford against him could his principal be joined
in the suit."
The relief asked was granted without the State becoming a
party to the record.
In United States v. Zee, the language just quoted from Osborne v. Bank of United States, was distinctly approved, and
the adjudged cases were held to show that the proposition,

OCTOBER TER31, 1883.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, Field, JJ.

that when an individual is sued in regard to property which he
holds in his capacity as an officer or agent of the United
-States, his possession cannot be disturbed when that fact is
3.rought to the attention of the court, has been overruled and
denied in every case where it has been necessary to decide it.
In my judgment it is impossible to reconcile the decision here
with the ruling in the Arlington case. As I concurred in the
opinion and judgment in. the latter case, I am constrained to
withhold my assent to the present decision. In United ,Slak8
v. Lee, the judicial power was deemed ample to oust officers of
the United States from the possession of property claimed by
them, not as individuals, but as the representatives of their
government. The possession of the government, by its officers,
did not prevent the court from inquiring into the alleged title
of the United States, and from awarding possession to those
who claimed it as their property. But, in the case before us,
the State of Georgia is allowed an exemption which the court
did not feel at liberty to extend to the United States. The claim
of complainant is, that he and others holding bonds indorsed by
that State have a lien upon property in the possession of certain
individuals. The latter assert a valid, complete title and the
right of exclusive possession in the State. But the complainant
contends that the alleged title of the State is not-good in law;
that the sale, in virtue of which the State asserts title and
holds possession, was not-a valid sale; that in any event the
State, or her governor, holds the title merely as a trustee for
others.
In effect, my brethren say that they will not determine these
matters, and that because it appears that th6 State is the sub.
stantial paity in interest, and that the defendants are only her
officers, in possession in her behalf, the complainant and those
united in interest with him must go out of court. It seems to
me that the grounds upon which the Court proceeds would
have led to a different conclusion, not only in United State v.
Zee, but in all the prior decisions therein referred to as authority for the judgment in that case.
The court say that the judgment in United Slates v. Zee
did not conclude the United States. So it may be said here,

CTJNNIITGRAA v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 465
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, Field, JJ.

that no decree rendered would have concluded the State of
Georgia, had she declined to appear in the suit. But as in the
former case the court did not decline to give relief because of
the mere assertion of title in the United States, so in this case
the mere assertion, of title in the State should not have prevented an adjudication as to complainant's claim. Had the
court ascertained that the property in contest was in the rightful possession and control of the State, then, but not before, the
question would have arisen whether the bill must not be dismissed, so long as the State refused to become a party to the
suit.
The court in its opinion reviews numerous cases other than
those I have referred to, and states the principles upon which,
in its judgment, they were decided. I content myself with
saying that the correctness of that review is not conceded.
Limitations ap.d qualifications are now placed upon former
decisions which their language, I submit, does not justify. A
doubt is now expressed as to whether Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall.
215, did not go beyond the verge of sound doctrine; this, notwithstanding the decision in the Arlington case was made to
rest largely upon _Davis v. Gray. In the Arlington case, we
quoted from Davis v. Gray, a suit in equity, the following
statement of the doctrine applicable to suits in the determination of which a State is interested:
"Where the State is concerned, the State should be made a
party if it can be done. That it cannot be done, is a sufficient
reason for the omission to do it, and the court may proceed to
decree against the officers of the State in all respects as if the State
were a party to the record. In deciding who are parties to the
suit, the court will not look beyond the record. Making a State
officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law
may have prompted his action, and the State may stand behind
him as a realparty in interest. A State can be made a party only
by shaping the bill expressly with that view, as where individuals
or corporations are intended to be put in that relation to the case."
The only comment made, in the Arlington case upon this'
language was "that though not prepared to say now that the
VOL. cIX-80

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.

court can proceed against the officer, in zffl respects, as if the
State were a party, this may be taken as intimating in a general way the views of the court at that time."
But I especially dissent from the statement by the court of
the question involved in .ouisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711.
Had the court there denied the relief asked upon the sole
ground that granting it would be "to take charge of the
treasury of the State, and, seizing the hands of the auditor and
treasurer, to make distribution of the funds found in treasury
in the manner which the court might think just," I should not,
in that case, have expressed any dissent from the action of my
brethren. I am unwilling by silence to accede to the suggestion that the substantial relief asked in louisianav. Tumel,
could not have been granted without taking charge of the
treasury of the State. There were in the hands of the
treasurer of Louisiana money raised by taxation under certain
constitutional and statutory provisions. It was money which,
by contract with creditors of the State, was set apart and appropriated to the payment of the interest due on designated
bonds of the State. The records of the State treasurer's office
showed the exact amount obtained by taxation for that purpose.
It was in the power of the officers of the State to have paid
that money out in discharge of her contract obligations without
the slightest confusion in the accounts of the State treasurer.
The contrary was not claimed by those officers. But the
treasurer and other officers declined to apply the money in
their hands for the purposes to which it had been dedicated.
They rested their refusal upon an ordinance passed by the
State, which was conceded on all hands to be in palpable
violation of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore.null and void. As a reason for not discharging a plain
official duty imposed by law, those officers referred to a void
provision in the Constitution of Louisiana, and. it was held
that there was no power in the courts of the Union to compel
the performance of that duty. This court declined to give any
relief against the State officedrs of Louisiana, partly upon the.
ground that the relief asked "will require the officers, against •
whom the process is issued, to act contrary to the positive

CUN NTGHAM v. MACON & BRUNSWICK R.R. CO. 467
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, Field, JJ.

orders of the supreme political power of the State, whose
creatures they are, and to which they are ultimately responsible in law for what they do." "They must," proceeded this
court, "use the public money in the treasury and under their
official control in one way, when the supreme power has
directed them to use it in another, and they must raise more
money by taxation, when the same power has declared that it
shall not be done." Thus the Constitution of the United States,
which is the supreme law of the land, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding,
was, as I then thought and still think, subordinated to "the
supreme political power" of the State of Louisiana.
My brethren declare it to be impossible to compel a State
to pay its debts by judicial process. As no decree was asked
against the State on the bonds held by complainant, and since
the State was not made a party to the record, it is difficult to
perceive why it was deemed necessary to make this declaration.
But if, by that declaration, it was meant that no State can be
sued as a party to the record, and no judgment rendered against
it as a party defendant, the proposition will not be disputed. I
submit, however, that under our system of government the
citizen may demand that the courts shall determine his claim
to, or his alleged lien upon, property, by whatever individuals
that property may be held, and that he cannot be denied an
adjudication and enforcement of that claim merely because the
individuals sued aw, ert right of possession and title in the
government they represent. The hardship and injustice of a
different rule is well illustrated in the present case, especially
as respects the property embraced by the deed of trust to
Whittle. The bill alleges, and the demurrer admits, that that
property was not covered by the statutory and executed mortgages upon which the State rests its claim. If these averments
are true, the State of Georgia has no pretence of right, by its
officers, to hold that property. But my brethren adjudge-if
I do not misapprehend the opinion-that the assertion by defendants of title in the State is sufficient to preclude judicial
inquiry into the rightfulness of their possession or the validity
of the State's title.

'.OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Syllabus.

My brethren say that "on the hypothesis that the foreclosure by the governor was valid, the trust asserted by plaintiff is
vested in the State as trustee, and not in any of the officers
sued." But, may not the court inquire whether that hypothesis
be sound I Must it be assumed to be sound because the officers
of the State so declare? Besides, if the alleged trust was
vested in the State as trustee-if, as claimed by complainant,
the State became the trustee of the property mortgaged for
the benefit of the bondholders-may not the court proceed to
a decree as between the parties to the record? If the trustee
cannot be made a party, and refuses to appear, the court ought
not, for that reason, to permit the interests of others to be sacrificed.
If the officers of the United States may be deprived of the
possession of property held by them for the government, but
the title to which is judicially ascertained, in an action against
them only, not to be legally in the United States, I do not see
why the courts may not, at the suit of the citizen, enforce his
claims upon property as against officers of a State, who may be
judicially ascertained, in a suit against them, not to be in rightfal possession for such State. Such relief would not conclude the
rights of the State, but would leave to her the privilege of
asserting her claim in any court of competent jurisdiction.
I am authorized by -MR. JusTIc. FIELD to say that he concurs
in this opinion.
