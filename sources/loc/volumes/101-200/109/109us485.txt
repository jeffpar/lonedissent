overruled by the later cases in the same State.
This action cannot, therefore, be maintained for the negligence of the engineman in running his engine too fast, or in
not giving due notice of its approach.
3. The statute of West Virginia, on which the plaintiff
relies, has no application to this case. There is no evidence
that the engine which struck the plaintiff was about to cross a
highway; and the main, if not the sole, object of the statute
evidently was to protect travellers on the highway. O')onndl

Conflict of Laws-Constittdional Law--furisdictin---Louisiana-PracticeProbateof Wills-Wills.
1. When an heir at law brings a suit in equity to set aside the probate of a
will in Louisiana as null and void, and to recover real estate ; and prays
for an accounting of rents and profits by an adverse party in possession,
who claims under the will, this court will refuse to entertain the prayer
for recovery of possession, if Ahe complainant has a plain, adequate, and
complete remedy at the common law. Hipp v. Babin, 19 Howard, 271,
affirmed.
2. Circuit courts, as courts of equity, have no general jurisdiction for annulling or affirming the probate of a will. Broderick's Will, 21 Wall.

not conferred, and it cannot be exercised by them at all, until, in a case
at law or in equity, its exercise becomes necessary to settle a controversy
of which a court of the United States may take cognizance by reason of
the citizenship of the parties.
4. If by the law obtaining in a State, a suit whose object is to annul and set
aside the probate of a will of real estate can be maintained, it may be
maintained in a federal court, when the parties are on one side citizens
of the State in which the will is proved, and on .the other citizens of
other States. Gainesv. -uentes, 92 U. S. 18, approved.
5. By the laws of Louisiana an-action of revendication is the proper one to be
brought for the purpose of asserting the legal title and right of possession of the heir at law to the succession, when another is in possession
nuider claim of title by virtue of a -will admitted to probate. In a proper
case as to parties this action can be brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States. And as it furnishes a plain, adequate and complete
remedy at law, it is a bar to the prosecution of a suit in chancery.

The appellants, who were complainants below, are alleged in
the bill of complaint to be, respectively, citizens of New York
or Missouri, or British subjects and aliens, the defendant being
a citizen of Mississippi.
It is set forth in the bill that Sarah Ann Dorsey died on July
4th, 1879, seized in fee simple of certain real estate, consisting

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

of two plantations in Tensas Parish, in Louisiana, an estate
called Beauvoir and other property in Harrison county, iMississippi, and real estate, not described, in Arkansas, besides a
large amount of movable and personal property, rights, and
credits, also not described; that she died, leaving no heirs in
the ascending or descending lines, the appellants being her
next of kin and sole legal heirs in'the collateral line, entitled to
succeed, in case of intestacy, to the whole of her estate; that
during her lifetime, on May 1oth, 1878, Mrs. Dorsey, by a
notarial act of procuration, constituted the defendant her agent
and attorney in fact, with full and special powers to take exclusive control, charge, and management of all her property
and estate, and all transactions and business in any manner
connecte l therewith, including the power,
"For. and in her name to sue and t' be' sued, to purchase,
lease, alienate, or encumber real estate situate anywhere, to borrow money, execute notes, or other evidences of indebtedness.
",That, in virtue of said agency, the defendant entered upon
and assumed the exclusive management of said property and
business, and took possession of all account books, title deeds,
and papers thereto appertaining, and continued in the exclusive
control, management, and possession as said agent to the time
said agency expired by the death of the principal, and since her
said death has still continued in said exclusive possession, management, and control.
"That though,, on the expiration of said agency, it was incumbent on and the duty of said defendant to render to said
heirs, all of whom, and their respective rights, were well known
to him, a full, fair, and correct account of his administration of
said agency, and to surrender to them, all and singular, the said
property, account books, title deeds, papers, &c., which had then
come into his possession, and which your orators had well hoped
he would have done, yet, on the expiration of his said agency,
said defendant, notwithstanding amicable demand, refuses still so
to do."
It is further alleged in the bill that the defendant claims that
the said Sarah Ann Dorsey, by her last will and testament,

-

488

Opinion of the Court.

bequeathed to him all her property, for his own sole use and
-benefit, and thereby constituted him her sole heir and executor,
and that, by viitue thereof, he is entitled in his own right to
â€¢said estate; -and the bill admits that on July 15th, 1879, the
defendant caused to be filed in the Second District Court for
the Parish of Orleans an instrument written and signed by
Sa ah Ann Dorsey, of which the following is a copy:
"BEAuvoi, HARRIsoN Co., Miss., Tan. 4, 1878.
III, Sarah Ann Dorsey, of Tensas Parish, La., being aware of
the uncertainty of life, and being now in sound health in mind
and body, do make this my last will and testament, which I write,
sign, and seal with my own hand, in the presence of three competent witnesses, as I'possess property in the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Arkansas. I owe no obligation of any sort whatever to any relatioin of my own ; I have done all I could for them
during mylife ; I therefore give and bequeath all my property, real,
personal, and mixed, wherever located and situated, wholly and
entirely, and without hindrance or qualification, to my most honored and esteemed friend, Jefferson Davis, ex-president of the
Confederate States, for his own sole use and benefit, in fee simple,
forever; and I herieby constitute him my sole heir, executor, and
administrator. If Jefferson Davis should not -survive me, I give
all that I have bequeathed to him to his youngest daughter,
Varina.
."I do not intend to share the ingratitude of my country towards
the man who is, in my eyes, the highest and noblest in existence.
"1'Intestimony whereof I sign this will, written with my
own
hand, in presence of W. T. Watthall, F. S. Hewes, and John C.
Craig, subscribing witnesses, resident in Harrison County, Mississippi"(Signed)
SARAH ANN Dons Y.
"At Mississippi City, on the fourth day of January, eighteen
hundred and seventy-eight, the above-named Sarah Ann Dorsey
signed and sealed this instrument, and published and declared
the same as and for her last will, and. we, in her presence and at
her request, and in the presence of each other., have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.
"W. T. WATTHALL.
"F. S: HwEEs.
"JOHN C. CRAIG."

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

But it is charged that the pretended will is not valid, but is
void, because at the time of writing and signing the same
Sarah Ann Dorsey was not of sound and disposing mind, because the same was written and signed by her when under the
undue influence of the defendant, which undue influence excited
and aggravated the causes depriving her of a sound and dis-:
posing mind, rendering her more susceptible to such undue influence, and because the motive and object inducing and controlling the testatrix to make the same were contrary to law.
The bill then proceeds to recite in detail a narrative of facts
alleged in support of these charges affecting the testamentary
capacity of Mrs. Dorsey and the integrity of the execution of
the instrument as her testament; and alleges further that the
defendant, "1though in nowise ignorant of the premises herein
before set forth touching the nullity of said alleged will,"
nevertheless resorted to proceedings before the Second District
Court for the Parish of Orleans for the probate thereof, "ex
jgarte and without any previous notification thereof, judicial or
extra-judicial." And it is thereupon further alleged:
"That by said proceedings it appears that on the 15th July,
1879, defendant, through his attorneys, filed his certain petition,

in which he alleges that by the tenor of the last will and testament
of Mrs. Sarah Ann Dorsey, dated 4th January, 1878, he is made
the legatee and executor of the deceased; that said will had been
on said day filed, and which he prays might be duly proved according to law; that thereupon an order was obtained that siid
will should be proved before the judge of said court forthwith;
that in accordance with said order, and on proof that -aid instrument was wholly written, dated, and signed in the handwriting o
the testatrix (the only proof essential under the laws of Louisiant.
and the practice of its courts for an ex parte probate of an oio.
graphical will), and on the further (and unusual in such ex part.
probate) sworn statement of two of the subscribing witnesses that
"the testatrix, Mrs. Sarah Ann Dorsey, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid will, was of sound and disposing mind," a
decree if probate, in usual form, was rendered, decreeing the probate and registry of the will and execution of its provisi6hs, in.

Opinion of the Court.

cluding the issuing of letters of executorship, on defendant's
complying with the provisions of law.
"That by said proceedings it further appears that without
previously qualifying as executor or applying for an order of inventory, or in any manner showing to the court the amount of the
indebtedness of the succession ; without tendering any security to
creditors or deferring his applicatibn for a reasonable time within
which creditors might, should they desire, demand of him security,
or heirs might contest the validity of the will, or any of its provisions, or the sufficiency of the testimony of its probate-proceedings not only usual, but, as to most of them, essential prerequisites
to any demand by a testamentary heir or universal legatee to be
put in possession of an estate; yet, notwithstanding this, said
defendant, on the said 15th July, by representing to the court that
the testatrix left no forced heirs and awed no considerable debt,
that he was willing. to accept and take the succession pure and
simple, and that in his opinion 'there is no necessity of further administration,' obtained an order, 'That, as the sole and universal
legatee of the late Sarah Ann Dorsey, petitioner, Jefferson Davis,
be put in possession of all the property, real, personal, and mixed,
left by her and wherever situated.'
"That by said proceedings and decrees said Second District
Court ceased to have jurisdiction over or regarding the administration of said succession, and, owing to his citizenship and the
limited jurisdiction of said court, defendant in the premises ceased
to be in any manner further amenable or subject to its jurisdiction.
"1That, although said proceedings and decrees, as your orators
are advised, are not res acjudicataagainst them, yet, nevertheless,
in virtue thereof, said will and its order of probate are and will remain a muniment of title in defendant to all and singular the
estate of said Sarah Ann Dorsey so long as said will and order of
probate shall remain unannulled and unrevoked through judicial
proceedings had .ontradictorily with said defendant."
-And it is further alleged that this decree of probate was unadvisedly rendered and should be revoked, cancelled, and recalled, for. the reasons rendering said will, of which it is the
probate, null and void, and because the testimony given in
support of the probate was false and erroneous, and because,
even if uncontradicteO, it would be insufficient.

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

It is further charged in the bill, that the defendant also
claims title to the estate in Mississippi called " Beauvoir," by
virtue of a sale to him of said property and a conveyance
thereof made by Sarah Ann Dorsey February 19th, 1879, a
copy of which is set out, which the applicants aver, however,
to be null aid void, for the same reasons on which they allege
the will to be void, and because at the time the defendant
occupied towards the, said Sarah Ann Dorsey such a relation
of trust and confidence, as that he had no right to purchase
the property, and that his consent to the sale thereof to himself,
without security for the payment of the price, which was.below
its value, was a violation of his trust, for which reasons, it is
claimed, said sale should be cancelled and annulled.
It is also alleged in the bill, "that, owing to the complicated
character of the said agency thus held by defendant, an account
thereof, as herein demanded, cannot properly be taken except
in a court'of equity."
The prayer of the bill is as follows:
"And that it may be decreed that the said alleged -ill of the
said Sarah Ann Dorsey, dated 'Beauvoir, Harrison County, Mississippi, January 4, 1878, and filed in the Second Distiict Court for
the parish of Orleans in the record of her succession under No.
41,376 of the docket, on the 15th July, 1879, be cancelled and annulled as absolutely void and of no effect in law; and that the decree of probate of said alleged will, and the decree recognizing
said defendant to be the sole and universal legatee of said Sarah
Ann Dorsey, and as such ordered to be put in possession of all the
property left by her, wherever situateA, both rendered on said 15th
July, 1879, and in extenso set forth in Exhibit B, be revoked,
cancelled, and recalled as absolutely void and of no effectin law;
and that the alleged sale and conveyance of propert situate in,
Harrison County, Mississippi, by said Mrs. Dorsey to defendant,
on the 19th February, 1879, and in extenso set forth in Exhibit C,
be cancelled and annulled as absolutely void and of no effect in7

such entitled to tlhe ownership and possession of all and singular
the property belonging to her estate, and which in any manner has
come into the- possession of said defendant, either as agent or
trustee.
"And that it be further decreed that said defendant come to a
full dnd fair account of all and singular his acts and doings of his
agency under the said act of procuration of May 10th, 1878 ; and
that it be decreed the defendant furnish to this honorable court a
full and detaile'd statement of all properties, real and personal, of
said Sarah Ann Dorsey, which came into his possession or under
his control and management as her agent, or of which he has taken
possession under and by virtue of said alleged will or said decrees
of the Second District Court of July 15th, 1879, or said alleged
sale of February 19th, 1879.
"And that it be further decreed that said defendant at once
surrender unto your orators, and, if so desired by them, jointly
with their coheirs, the possession of all said property, including all
books, papers, evidences, title-deeds, &c., which, belonging to
said estate, at any time since May 10th, 1878, has come into his
possession.
"And that defendant be perpetually enjoined and restrained by
the decree of this court from setting up or pleading said alleged
will, said decree of probate, said decree of possession, and said
act of sale, or any title, right, or claim thereunder, against your
orators as next of kin and legal heirs of said Mrs. Sarah Ann
Dorsey.
"And that it be further decreed that defendant make a full and
true discovery and disclosure of and concerning all and singular
the transactions and matters appertaining to or connected with
his said agency, as well during the lifetime as since the death of
his principal. And that defendant may be decreed to come to an
account with your orators, to be taken by and under the direction
and decree of this honorable court, of all his dealings and transactionsunder the agency assumed by him under the act of procuration of May 10th, 1878, or as trustee since Mrs. Dorsey's
death, and to pay over to your orators what shall be found due to
them by defendant upon the taking of said account."
To this bill the defendant below fied a demurrer, which de-

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court

murrer was sustained and a decree rendered dismissing the bill
without prejudice, to reverse which this appeal is prosecuted.
One of the main objects of this bill is to obtain from the de,
fendant an account of the rents and profits received by him of
the estate formerly belonging to Sarah Ann Dorsey, and, in
order thereto, a declaration that the legal title to that estate
is vested in them as her heirs at law and next of kin, ina decree
that the alleged will under which the defendant claims, and the
probate thereof, are nill and void. It is admitted that the de,
fendant is in possession, and that he holds adversely to the
appellants; and there is a prayer in the bill for a recovery of
the possession. In no respect does it differ from the frame of
the bill in Hipp v. Babi, 19 Howard, 271.
In that case the complainaits sought by a bill in equity to
recover possession of real estate to which they claimed title, as
against a judicial sale, alleged to be void as against them, under
,which .the defendants were in possession, and also for an account of rents and profits. The court refused to entertain the
prayer for the recovery of the possession, on the ground that
the remedy of the complainants at law was plain and adequate.
It was urged that the bill would, nevertheless, lie for the. account. To this Mr. Justice Campbell, delivering the opinion of
the court, replied as follows:
"Nor can the court retain the bill under an impression that a
court of chancery is better adapted for the adjustment of the account for rents, profits, and improvements. The rule of the court
is, that when a suit for the recovery of the possession can be properly brought in a court of equity, and a decree is given, that court
will direct an account as an incident in the cause. liut when a
party has a right to a possession which he can enforce at law, his
right to the rents and profits is also a legal right, and must be enforced in the same jurisdiction. The instances where bills for an
account of rents and profits have been maintained are those in
which special grounds have been stat.ed to show that courts of law
could not give a plain, adequate, and complete remedy. No in,
stances exist where a person who had been successful at law had
been allowed to file a bill for an account of rents and profits during
the tortious possession held against him; or in which the complex.,

OCTOBER ]ERT.,

ity of the account has afforded a moti -. ror the interposition of a
court of chancery to decide the title and to adjust the account."
This case was cited and its doctrine approved and applied in
the recent case of Boot v. _Raibway Co., 105 U. S. 189-212.
In the present bill no circumstances are alleged to except the
case from the general rule. The defendant did not sustain
towards the complainants at any time any relation of trust and
confidence; he was not their agent; and any right which they
can assert against him for the rents and profits of the estate is
altogether dependent upon their title to that estate, and cannot
arise until that has beeh established. The title which they
assert to that is not an equitable, but a legal title, as heirs at
law and next of kin of Sarah Ann Dorsey, and is to be established and enforced by a direct proceeding at law for the recovery of the possession which they allege the appellee illegally
'ithholds.
There is no ground, therefore, on which the bill
can be supported for the account as prayed for.
It is contended, however, for. the appellants that the bill
ought to have been maintained, for the purpose of decreeing
the invalidity of the will of Mrs. -Dorsey and annulling the
probate, so far at least as it gave effect to the will as a muniment of title.
It is well settled that no such jurisdiction belongs to the circuit courts of the-United States, as courts of equity; for courts
of equity, as such, by virtue of their general authority to
enforce equitable rights and remedies, do not administer relief
in such cases. The question in this aspect was- thoroughly
-considered and finally settled by the decision of this court in
the case of Broderick'8 T ll, 21 Wall. 503. It was elaborately
considered and finally determined in England by the House of
Lords in the case of Allen v. _YekPhemon, 1 House of Lords'
Cas. 191. In that country, it was undoubtedly the practice of
the courts of chancery to entertain bills to perpetuate the testimony of the witnesses to a will devising lands, at the suit of
the, devisee against the heir at law, it being alleged that the
latter disputed its validity; and this, as Blackstone says, 3 BI.
Com. 450, "is what is usuallymeant in proving a will in chan-

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

cery." It is also true, that a bill in equity, in the nature, of a
bill of peace, or qui timet, would lie at the suit of a devisee
against the heir at law, in which the validity of the will having
been sustained by the verdict of a jury on'the trial of an issue,
deviavit ve non, a decree might be passed establishing the will
and the title of the devisee under it, and perpetually enjoining
the heir at law from setting up any claim of.title against it.
Story on Equity Jurisprudence, Â§ 1447. The heir at law, it was
formerly held, was not entitled to file such a bill, for he could
bring his action of ejectment, and thus had his remedy at law;
although such a bill would be entertained if not objected to, or
if there were any impediments to the proper trial of the merits
on such an action. Bootle v. Blundell, 19 Ves. Jr. Oh. R. 494.
The modern rule is "that the usual and generally more convenient practice is to enable the heir t.proceed by ejectment, but
that it is open to the court to direct an issue, if from any cause
that course appears desirable." Boy8e v. 1ossborough,6 House
of Lords' Cas. 1-42. The manifest ground on which courts of
equity in England proceeded, in declining the jurisdiction in,
question was, that as to wills of personalty, the jurisdiction of
courts of probate was exclusive, and that as to devises, the remedy at law was plain, adequate, and complete. In this country, from a time anterior to the adoption of the Constitution,
the same distinction of jurisdiction has existed, all probate and
testamentary matters having been confided either to separate
courts of probate, under different denominations, or a special
jurisdiction over them having been vested in courts having
jurisdiction also over other subjects. For reasons growing out
of our policy, which subjected real estate equally ith personalty to the payment of debts, and in other respects freed it
from feudal fetters, the probate jurisdiction was extended, but
with varying effect in different States, over wills of land, as
well as of personal chattels; preserving, however, in some form,
the rights and remedies of heirs at law to contest their validity.
But it was almost universally recognized that no will could
have effect, for any purpose, until admitted to probate and
record by the local authority, although in some States, while
the original probfe was conclusive until set aside, for all put-

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

poses and as to all persons, in others it was conclusive, while in
force at all, only as to personalty and for the purposes of administration, and'not as a muniment of title as to devises. In
States where it is held to have a conclusive force, formal modes
are prescribed of contesting the validity of the instrument as a
will, and of the regularity and legality of the probate, by suits
regularly instituted solely for that purpose, and interpartme;
but such proceedings are generally regarded as the exercise
of probate jurisdiction, even if administered in courts other
than that of original probate, but the judgment, as in other
cases inter par8, binds only parties and privies. In those
States where the probate, although conclusive while in
force as to personalty and for the purposes of administration
merely, is only pirafacie evidence where the will is relied
on as a muniment of title to real estate, its validity may
become a question to be tried whenever and wherever a litigation arises doncerning real property, the title to which is affected by it, just as in England, in actions of ejectment between
the heir and the devisee, or those claiming through them." In
a State, of which 1few"York is an example, where, by its law,
its own courts of general civil jurisdiction are authorized thus
incidentally and collaterally to try and determine the question
of the validity of a willt and its probate in a suit involving
the title to real property, there can be no question but that the
circuit courts of the United States might have jurisdiction of
such a suit by reason of the citizenship of the parties, and in
exercising it would be authorized and required to determine, as
a court administering the law of that State, the same questions.
And where provision is made by the laws of a State, as is the
case in many, for trying the question of the validity of a will
already admitted to probate, by a litigation between parties in
which that is the sole question, with the effect, if the judgment
shall be in the negative, of rendering the probate void for all
purposes as between the parties and those in privity with them,
it may be that the courts of the United States have jurisdiction,
under existing provisions of law, to administer the remedy and
establish the right in a case where the controversy is -wholly
between citizens of different States. The judicial power of the

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

United States extends, by the terms of the Constitution, "to
controversies between citizens of different States ;" and on the
supposition, which is not admitted, .that this embraces only such
as arise in cases "in law and equity," it does not necessarily exclude those which. may involve the exercise of jurisdiction in
reference to the proof of validity of wills. The original probate, of course, is mere matter of State regulation, and depends
entirely upon the local law; for it is that law which confers the
power of making wills, and prescribes the conditions upon which
alone they may take effect; and as, by the law in almost all
the States, no instrument can be effective as a will until proved,
no rights in relation to it, capable of being contested between
parties, can arise until preliminary probate has been first made.
Jurisdiction as to wills, and their probate as such, is neither
included in nor excepted out of the grant of judicial power to.
the courts of the United States. So far as it is e parte and
merely administrative, it is not conferred, and it cannot be
exercised by them at all until, in a case at law or in equity, its
exercise becomes necessary to settle a controversy of which a
court of the United States may take cognizance by reason of
the citizenship of the parties. It has often been decided by this
court that the terms "law" and "equity," as used in the Constitution, although intended to mark and fix the distinction between the two systems of jurisprudence as known and practised
at the time.of its adoption, do not restrict the jurisdiction conferred by it to the very rights and remedies then recognized
and employed, but embrace as well not only rights newly created by statutes of the States, as in cases of actions for the loss
occasioned to survivors by the death of a person caused by the
wrongful act, neglect, or default of -another (Raivay Co. v.

Justice Campbell, delivering its opinion, that "the court has
repeatedly decided that the jurisdiction of the courts of the
United States over controversies between citizens of different
States cannot be impaired by the laws of the States, which
prescribe the modes of redress in their courts, or which regulate
the distribution of their judicial power."
In Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, it was decided that the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States, in a case for
equitable relief, was not excluded because, by the laws of the
State, the matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of its,
probate courts; but, as in all other cases of conflict between
jurisdictions of independent and concurrent authority, that
which has first acquired possession of the res, which is the subject of the litigation, is entitled to administer to it. W'lla 8

which the, judicial power of the United States may be extended;
and Congress may, therefore, lawfully provide for bringing, at the
option of either of 'the parties, all such controversies within the
jurisdiction of the federal judiciary."
And, referring to the nature of suits which, as in that case,
sought to annul the probate of a will and adjudge it to be
invalid, the court further said (p. 20):
"And if by the' law obtaining in the State, customary or statutory, they can be maintained in a State court, whatever designation that court may bear, we think they may be maintained by
original process in a federal court, where the parties are, on the
one side, citizens of Louisiana, and, on the other, citizens of other
States."
As that was a case in which the sole question .decided was

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

the right of the defendant to remove the cause from the State
court to the Circuit Court of the United States, under the act
of March 2d, 1876, 14 Stat. 558, it was assumed, and not decided, that the said suit brought in the State court was one
which, under the laws of the State, its courts were authorized
to entertain for the purpose of granting the relief prayed for.
The point decided was, that if it were it might properly be
transferred to a court of the United States.
It remains, therefore, in the present case to inquire whether
the complainants are entitled, under the laws of Louisiana, to
draw in question, in this mode and with a view to the decree
sought, the validity of the will of Sarah Ann Dorsey and the
integrity of its probate.
An examination of the decisions of the Supreme Court of
Louisiana on the subject will disclose that a distinction is made
in reference to proceedings to annul a will and its probate,
according to the objects to be accomplished by the judgment
and the relation of the parties to the subject. If the administration of the succession is incomplete and in j?&q, and the
object is to alter or affect its course, the application must be
made to the court of probates, which, in that case, .has possession of the subject and exclusive jurisdiction over it. If, on the
other hand, the succession has been closed, or has proceeded so
far that the parties entitled under the will have been put in
possession of their rights to the estate, then the resort of adverse claimants must be to an action of revendication in the
courts of general jurisdiction, in which the legal title is asserted
as against the will claimed to be invalid, making an issue involving that question.
In 0']Donogan v. Knox, 11 La. 384, the Supreme Court of
Louisiana said:
"It appears then that the jurisdiction of the courts of probate is
limited to claims against successions for money, and that all claims
for real property appertain to the ordinary tribunals, and .are
denied to courts of probate. The plaintiff in this case was therefore compelled, in suing for the property of the succession, to seek
redress in the district court, and whether she attacked the will, or

Opinion of the Court.
the defendant set it up as his title to the property, the court having the cognizance of the subject must of necessity examine into
its legal effect. And although the will may have been admitted
to probate and 'an order given for its execution, yet these are only
preliminary proceedings necessary for the administration of the
estate, and not a judgment binding on those who are not parties to
them.
When, therefore, in an action of revendication a testament with probate becomes a subject of controversy, it will surely
not be contended that a court of ordinary jurisdiction, having cognizance of the principal matter, shall suspend its proceedings until
another court of limjited power shall pronounce upon the subject;
for in that case the ordinary courts would sub'mit to another tribunal the decision of the main question in the cause, without
right of trial by jury, and would have little else to do than to
comply with its decree."
In Robert v. Allier's -Agent, 1T La. 4, the same court said:
"On the question of jurisdiction arising from the state of the
case we understand the distinction repeatedly made by this court
to be that whenever the validity or legality of a will is attacked
and put at issue (as in the present case) at the time that an order
for its execution is applied for, or after it has been regularly probated and ordered to be executed, but previous to the heirs or
legatees coming into possession of the estate under it, courts of
probate alone have jurisdiction to declare it void, or to say that it
shall not be executed. This is the purport and extent of the decision 'in the case of Zewis' Heirs v. His .Eecutoms, 6 La. 387 ; C.
of Pr., Art. 924, Â§ 1. But when an action of revendication is instituted by an heir at law against, the testamentary heir or universal legatee, who has been put in possession of the estate, and who
sets up the will as his title to the property, district courts are the
proper tribunals in which such suits must be brought. 6 Martin's
N. S.- 263 ; 2 La. Rep. 23 ; 11 La. Rep. 388."
In 1?acws v. _Rachal, 1 Rob. (La.) 115, it is also said:
"We cannot consider the question of jurisdiction as an open
one. ,The doctrine is now well settled that in a suitfor property,
whether the plaintiff attacks the will under which it is held or the
defendant sets it up as his title to the property claimed, the

Opinion of the Court.
courts of ordinary jurisdiction before whom the principal matter,
to wit, the action of revendication, is brought, must of necessity
pronounce on the validity of the will which is thus drawn in
question. The proceedings had in the court of probate for the
settlement of the estate, such as the probate of the will and the
order given for its execution, cannot have the effect contended for
by the appellant; they cannot be considered as a judgment binding on the plaintiffs, who were not parties to them." '
In Sucee8in of DuTle&m8, 10 IRob. (La) 193, it is said:
"This court has often held that the admission of a will to probate, and the order given for its execution, are only preliminary
proceedings necessary for the Administration of the estate, and do
not amount to a judgment binding on those who are not parties
thereto."
To the same effect are Suecesm&
of .Dupuy,4 La. Ann.
570 ; &oAle v. Dup/esi, 2 La. Ann. 724; A6ton v. Abston,15
La. Ann. 137.
In Shar.p v. Znox,2 La. 23, it was said:
"The petitioner himself shows that the defendant holds the
property claimed from him under a will and confirmatory act,
which she seeks to set aside. This she cannot effect except in a
court of'ordinary jurisdiction, i.e., in the district court."
In Hoover'8 Sucesion v. York, 30 La. Ani. 'T52, the suit
was simply to annul a will and the probate of a will, and to
have certain persons plaintiff declared heirs and entitled to
take as such. This, it was declared, was purely a probate proceeding, and cognizable alone by thd parish court in which
the succession was opened. "It was a matter incidentalto the
opening and settlement of the succession."
And the same principle governed the decision in Bla&ini v.
Bl8ini'8 Succemion, 30 La. Ann. 1388. That was an application in the probate court on the part of forced heirs, demanding
that their rights as such, known under the law of Louisiana as
their lUgitime, of which their ancestor could not deprive them
by his testament, should be recognized, so that they might

receive their share of the succession. The effect of allowing it
would be not to annul or invalidate the will, but merely to displace it, in the administration of the succession, to the extent
required by their indefeasible interest in it. It was objected to
the jurisdiction of the court that the succession had been closed
by a previous judgment sending the widow and testamentaxy
heir into possession; but the exception was overruled on the
ground that,the suit was of probate jurisdiction.
In Gibon v. Dooley, 32 La. Ann. 959, an action to annul a
will, it was held, might be brought in the parish court, although
the succession had been closed by a delivery of the property to
the instituted heir. The rule, as laid down in Robert v. Allier,
11 La. 15, was cited and approved, but was held not to apply.
The reason was given in these words:
"Here no action of revendication was instituted, but simply
a suit for the nullity of the will. There is no prayer for ejectment or that plaintiffs may be put, into or quieted in their possession of property claimed under the will."

By the law of Louisiana, C. of Pr., art. 4, a real action is
given, which relates to claims made on immovable property, or
to the immovable rights to which they are subjected, the object
of which is the ownership or the possession of such, property,
and, when prosecuted by one having the title against the person
in possession, is called the petitory action, and is the proper
action for the recovery of an universality of things, such as an
inheritance. -C. of Pr., art. 12. It is an action of revendication, C. of Pr., art. 43, and is the proper one to be brought for
the purpose of asserting the legal title and consequent right of
possession of the-heir at law to the succession, when another is
in possession under claim of title by virtue of a will admitted
to probate, as is abundantly shown by the citations already
made from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
We entertain no doubt that this action can be brought in a
proper case as to parties in the circuit court of the United
States.
The Louisiana Code of Practice, art. 556, et 8eq., provides for

ELLIS v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.

an action of nullity, whereby definite judgments may be revised, set aside, or reversed, which may proceed either on the
ground of vices of form or upon the merits, as that the judgment was obtained through fraud, and is a separate action,
commenced by petition, the adverse parties being cited as in
other suits. This action, with reference to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the United States, was the subject of consideration in Barrow v. Jltuntonr, 99 U. S. 80; but the present is not
an action of that description, for the relief prayed for is recovery of the possession of the inheritance, which, we have
seen, must be prosecuted in an action of revendication. Whether
the probate of a will is a definite judgment which can be the
subject of an action of nullity under these provisions of the
Code of Practice, is a question, therefore, which we are not
callel upon to discuss or decide. The case of Gainesv. Fuentes,
92 U. S. 10, was such an action of nullity, but, as before remarked, the point decided in that case was not that it would
lie, according to the law of Louisiana, but that if it would lie in
the State court it was removable to the circuit court of the
United States, because it presented a controversy wholly between citizens of different States.
The present suit is not an action of nullity, because it prays
for the recovery of possession of the, inheritance, to which the
appellants claim the legal title as heirs dt law of Sarah Ann
Dorsey. That claim, as has been shown, is properly the subject of an action of revendication, which furnishes a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law, and consequently constitutes a bar to the prosecution of a bill in chancery.
There is nothing left, therefore, as a ground of support for
the present bill, except so much of the case made By it as rests
upon the prayer for the cancellation of tle sale and conveyance of the Beauvoir estate by Mrs. Dorsey in her lifetime.
That relief is claimed in part on the ground of a constructive
fraud, growing out of the defendant's relation to her at the
time as a confidential agent; but we see nothing in the circumstances as detailed to forbid such a transaction between the
parties, and the charges of actual fraud and undue influence
applicable to this sale, considered as detached from the rest of

the case, are not of such character, even when admitted by the
demurrer, as in law would justify a recission. And as the case
for relief as to this sale is not made independently, but only as
part of the whole case intended to be presented by the bill, we
conclude that it must fal with the rest.
The demurrer was rightly sustained and the bill properly
dismissed.
Te decree is afflrmed.

TOWNSEND v. LITTLE and Others.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF

THE TERRITORY OF UTAH.

Argued November 26th, 1883.-Decided December 10th, 1888.

Constructive .Zotice-Deed,--raud--SecrelTrust-Statutea--Utah.
A, having acquired the right to occupy a tract of land in Salt Lake City, took
possession of it and erected a public house thereon, and lived in it with his
wife and B, his polygamous wife, carrying on a hotel there. He ceased to

maintain relations with B, as his polygamous wife, but he being desirous to
have the benefit of her services, both concealed this fact. He made a secret
agreement with her, that if she would thus remain she should have one-half
interestin the property. Ie acquired title to the property from the mayor
under the provisions of the act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 541, without
any disclosure of the secret agreement. Subsequently A's interest therein
passed into the hands of innocent third parties for value, without notice
of the claim of B under the secret agreement: Held,
1. That B had no rights in the premises as against innocent bona fide encumbrancers and purchasers without notice of her claim.
2. That the joint occupation of the premises by A and B, under the circumstances, was no constructive notice of B's claim of right.
8. The territorial act under which a deed of the property was made to A by
the mayor, directed that "deeds of conveyance of the same shall be
6xecuted by the mayor of the city or town, under seal of the corporation." A general'act of the Territory at the time the deed was made required deeds to be witnessed. The deed to A bore thb corporate seal, as
required by the special act; but was not witnessed: Held, that the
special act controlled the general act, and that the deed was good.

By an act of Congress passed March 3d, 1867, entitled
"An Act for the relief of the inhabitants of cities and towns
