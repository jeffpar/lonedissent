case, and by the same counsel.
MR. CHIEF Jus'iCE FULLER:

It was argued with that

These were suits in equity brought

by Taylor and Marshall against Beckham, and one Carter, asserting himself to be the president pro tempore of the Senate of
Kentucky, with the right to preside over that body though
Marshall was present, in which complainants prayed for injunctions restraining defendants from interfering with complainants in their offices. These suits were heard with the case of
Beckham v. Taylor and Mkiarshall, just decided. When the
Circuit Court of Jefferson County reached the conclusion that
Beckham was entitled to the office of Governor and entered
judgment of ouster, it dismissed the suits. From the decrees
appeals were taken to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, where
they were affirmed, and thereafter a writ of error from this
court was allowed.
It results from the conclusions announced in the j'receding
case that the writ of error must be dismissed, and it is so
ordered.
MR.- JUSTIcE MoKENNA concurred in the result.

v. Becl ham (No. 1), ante, 548.
