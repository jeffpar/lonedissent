Blackburn v. Portland Gold

.Xining Company, 175 U. S. 571.

In Mitchell v. Smale, the claim of Jordan was treated by the
court as coming within that ruling, but the case before us does
not. This was an ordinary action under a state statute for
wrongfully causing the death of plaintiff's intestate. No Federal question was in fact presented by the pleadings nor litigated at the trial. The liability depended on principles of general law applicable to the facts, and not in any way upon the
terms of the order appointing the receivers. Whatever the
rights of the receivers to remove the cause if they had been
sued alone, the controversy was not a separable controversy
within the intent and meaning of the act. This being so, the
case came solely within the first clause of the section, and we
are of opinion that it.was not intended by Congress that, under
such circumstances, there should be any difference between the
rule applied under the irst and the second clauses of section 2
of the act of 1887-8.

their State could not obtain, public moneys that could be applied in execution of the order of the Secretary of War within the time fixed by that
officer to complete the alteration of such bridge.

behalf of the United States against the plaintiffs in error as
Commissioners of the County of Muskingum, Ohio, having
power under the Liws of Ohio to control, alter and keep in repair all necessary bridges over streams and public canals on all
state and county roads.
The information was based upon the fourth and fifth sections
of the River and Harbor Act, approved September 19, 1890.
Those sections are as follows:
"ยง 4. That section nine of the River and Harbor Act of August 11th, 1888, be amended and reenacted so as to read as follows: That whenever the Secretary of War shall have good

Under power conferred by an act of the General Assembly
of Ohio, approved March 9, 1836, the authorities of the State,
between 1836 and 1840, constructed a series of locks and dams
on the Muskingum River between Marietta and Zanesville.
About the year 1838, under the authority of the State, a dam
was constructed across the main channel of the Muskingum River
at the rapids which entirely obstructed navigation at that point,
but locks and a side-cut canal were constructed so that boats could
pass southward to the river below the rapids. Immediately below that dam the'Commissioners of Muskingum County, about
the year 1874, under the authority of the state, constructed a
bridge across the river-the bridge here in question -whereby
the towns of Duncan Falls and Taylorsville on opposite sides of
the river were connected.
On the 2d day of May, 1885, the State of Ohio made a cession to the United States of the Muskingum River with its
improvements. The act of cession contained this provision:
"And for the purpose of enabling the United States to expend
any sum of money that is or may hereafter be appropriated by
Congress for the improvement of the Muskingum River, the
State of Ohio hereby transfers and cedes to the United States
the eleven locks and dams heretofore constructed by said State
on said river, together with all the grounds, canals and appurtenances belonging to the same, subject to the provisions of the
preceding sections of this act, as to the jurisdiction of the United
States over the lands and buildings authorized to be acquired
and constructed by said sections, and imposing penalties for
injuries to said work which shall extend and apply to the said
eleven docks and dams and their appurtenances hereby transferred and ceded to the United States, but the custody and
ownership of said Muskingum River improvement shall remain

Opinion of the Court.

in the State of Ohio, until such time as the United States appropriates sufficient money to properly improve and operate
the same." 82 Laws of Ohio, 220, 221.
The cession was accepted by the United States as is shown
by the River and Harbor Act of August 5, 1886, c. 929,
which contained this clause: "And the United States hereby
accepts from the State of Ohio the said Muskingum River improvements, and all the locks, dams and their appurtenances,
and the canals, belonging to said improvement, and all the
franchises and property of every kind and rights in said river,
and its improvements, now owned, held and enjoyed by the
State of Ohio, including all water leases and rights to use
water under and by virtue of any lease of water now running
and in force between the. State of Ohio and all persons using
said water, hereby intending to transfer to the United States
such rights in said leases and contracts as are now owned,
held or reserved by the State of Ohio; but not to affect any
right to the use of the water of said river now owned and
held by the lessees of any water rights under any lease or
contract with the State of Ohio. And the United States
hereby assumes control of said river, subject to the paramount
interest of navigation. The provisions of this act, so far as they
relate to the Muskingum River, shall not take effect, nor shall
the money hereby appropriated be available, until the State of
Ohio, acting by its duly authorized agent, turns over to the
United States all property ceded by the act of the General
Assembly aforesaid, and all personal property belonging to the
improvement aforesaid, and used in its care and improvement,
and any balance of money appropriated by said State for the
improvement of said river, and which is not expended on the
fifteenth day of July, 1886." 24 Stat. 310, 324.
By deed of January 31, 1887, the Board of Public Works
of Ohio, under legislative sanction, conveyed to the United
States all the lands and tenements, with the rights and appurtenances thereto belonging, then owned, held and enjoyed
by the State and theretofore occupied and used for canal and.
other purposes and known as the Muskingum River improvement.

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

During the years 1890 and 1891 the United States caused
to be constructed a lock at the head of the rapids in the dam
which the local authorities had maintained, and constructed
from that lock down the river, under the bridge and through
the rapids, an artificial canal outside of the main channel of
the river, and raised the locks and dam on the river below,
thus providing a new means of navigation at that point.
In the judgment of the United States' engineer having in
cha;rge the improvement of the Muskingum River, the construction by the Government of the new lock at Taylorsville
made it necessary to place a draw in the Taylorsville bridge
just below that lock. Of this fact the County Commissioners
were informed, and they were given an opportunity to submit
such statements, propositions and evidence bearing upon the
matter as they might deem pertinent. Finally the following
notice was issued from the War Department and served upon
the commissioners:
"WAR DEPARTMENT.
"WASHINGTON CiTr, February 25th,

1891.
"To the County Commissioners of Muskingum County, Ohio:
"Take notice that"Whereas the Secretary of War has good reason to believe
that the bridge owned and controlled by Iuskingum County,
Ohio, across the Muskingum River, between Taylorsville and
Duncans Falls, is an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of said river, (which is one of the navigable waters of
the United States,) on account of not being provided with a
draw span below the new United States lock No. 9 in said
river; and
"Whereas the following alteration will render navigation
through it reasonably free, easy and unobstructed, to wit, the
construction of a draw span in said bridge below the said lock
in accordance with the span shown on the map hereto attached; and
"Whereas to the 30th day of September, 1891, is a reasonable time in which to alter the said bridge as described above:

and fifth sections of an act of the Congress of the United States,
entitled 'An act making appropriations for the construction,
repair and preservation of certain public works on rivers and
harbors, and for other purposes,' approved September 19th,
1890, Redfield Proctor, Secretary of War, does hereby notify
the said County Commissioners of Muskingum County, Ohio,
to alter the said bridge as described above, and prescribes that
said alteration shall be made and completed on or before the
30th day of September, 1891.
"L. A. GRAwT,
"A88zstant Secretary of War."
No alteration of the bridge having been made by the Commissioners within the time limited by the Secretary of War,
the present information was filed against them on the 23d day
of November, 1891. The information, after referring to the
official character of the defendants and setting out the facts
showing the action of the War Department touching the proposed alteration of the bridge, charged that the defendants as
County Commissioners of Muskingum County "did unlawfully,
on, to wit, the 15th day of October, 1891, at the place aforesaid, and after receiving notice to that effect, as hereinbefore
required from the Secretary of War, and within the time prescribed by him, wilfully fail and refuse to comply with the said
order of the Secretary of War, and to make the alterations set
forth in said notice, contrary to the form of sections four and
five of an act of Congress approved September 19th, 1890."
A trial was had which resulted in a verdict of guilty. A
motion for new trial having been entered, the judges before
whom it was argued differed in opinion, and certified the following points of disagreement to this court: 1. Whether Congress has the power to confer upon the Secretary of War the
authority attempted to be conferred by said sections 4 and 5 of
the act of September 19, 1890, to determine when a bridge is
an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of a river.
2. Whether the failure to comply by persons owning and controlling the said bridge with the order of the Secretary of War
could lawfully subject them to a penalty for a misdemeanor.

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

This court held that since the passage of the judiciary act of
March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, c. 517, certificates of division of
opinion in criminal cases, according to ยง 651 and 697 of the
Revised Statutes, were not authorized. Un~ited States v. Rider,
163 U. S. 132, 139. The certificate of division of opinion in
this case was accordingly dismissed. Upon such dismissal the
motion for new trial was denied in the Circuit Court in accordance with the opinion of the presiding judge, and it was adjudged that each of the defendants be fined in the sum of ten
dollars. From that judgment the present writ of error has
been prosecuted.
We have seen that by the fourth section of the River and
Harbor Act of 1890 the Secretary of War was authorized,
after due notice to the parties interested and after hearing them,
to require persons or corporations owning or controlling any
bridge over a navigable waterway of the United States which
he had good reason to believe was an unreasonable obstruction
to the free navigation of such waterway, to so alter the bridge
as to render the navigation through or under it reasonably free,
easy and unobstructed; and that by the fifth section of the
same act it was made a misdemeanor for any person, corporation or association to wilfully fail or refuse to comply with the
lawful order of the Secretary.
The plaintiffs in error contend that those provisions are inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States in that
Congress has assumed to give the Secretary of War authority
to determine matters that are legislative in their nature.
On behalf of the Government it is contended that the act of
Congress has not delegated legislative power to the Secretary
but has only given to that officer authority to determine the
existence of certain facts as the foundation of such action by
him as might be necessary to give effect to the declared purpose of Congress to remove unreasonable obstructions to the
free navigation of the waterways of the United States. Field

The discussion of counsel also involved the question whether

Opinion of the Court.

partment-the expense to be incurred in the alteration of the
bridge in question, which was originally constructed in accordance with law, must not be borne by the United States, which
by its own agents made the proposed alteration of the bridge
necessary for the purposes of navigation.
These are questions of very considerable importance. But
in the view we have taken of the case, their determination is
not now necessary. The record presents another question
which, being determined in favor of the plaintiffs in error, requires a reversal of the judgment upon grounds that will protect them altogether against the present prosecution for not
complying with the order issued from the War Department.
At the trial in the Circuit Court it was proved that the notice
from the War Department to the County Commissioners to
make and complete the required alteration of the bridge between Taylorsville and Duncan Falls on or before September 30,
1891, was served in March of that year; that there were then
no funds in the hands of the Commissioners legally. available
for the purpose of making the proposed changes in the bridge;
and that under the laws of Ohio defining and limiting the
powers of the Commissioners, it was not possible for them
by any levy of taxes to raise the money necessary to alter the
bridge within the time limited by the notice from the Secretary of War.or before the commencement of this prosecution.
It has not been suggested, nor could it reasonably be held,
that the County Commissioners were bound, in any case, to
provide out of their own private estates the money (several
thousand dollars) necessary for the proposed alteration of the
bridge, or that they could be made liable criminally for not so
doing. The notice was addressed to them in their official capacity, and the prosecution against them was for failing to perform the duty alleged to be imposed upon them by the act of
Congress. What they could or could not lawfully do, in the
execution of the powers conferred upon them, must of course
be determined by the laws of the State under whose authority
they acted.
Assuming, for the purposes of the present decision, that the
words "the persons, corporation or association owning or con-

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

trolling any railroad or other bridge," may, under some circumstances, apply to officers of municipal corporations, charged generally with the control and repairing of bridges owned by such
corporations, the question remains whether any error of law was
committed at the trial to the prejudice of the plaintiffs in error.
The court charged the jury among other things: "Congress
had the constitutional power to confer upon the Secretary of
War the authority to determine when a bridge such as the
bridge in question is an unreasonable obstruction to the free
navigation of a river, and that the failure to comply by the
person owning and controlling any such bridge, as by the defendants in this case, if they should so find, with such a determination by the Secretary of War, after due notice and otherwise full compliance with the act of Congress in that behalf,
lawfully subjected them to prosecution for a misdemeanor, as
provided by the act of Congress."
To this instruction the defendants duly excepted. Assuming
the act of 1890 not liable to any constitutional objection, we
think that the court, in view of the evidence, erred in saying,
as in effect it did, that the mere failure of the defendants to
comply with the order of the Secretary brought them within
the act of Congress and subjected them to prosecution. The
charge ignored altogether the proof showing that the defendants had no public moneys which they could have applied to the
alteration of the bridge, and that under the laws of the State
no money could be obtained, by way of taxation so as to make
the required alteration within the time fixed by the Secretary
of War. The court made the guilt of the accused depeiid alone
upon the inquiry whether they had complied with the order of
the Secretary of War. This was error. It ought not to be
supposed that Congress intended, even if it had the power, to
subject officers of a State to criminal prosecution for not doing
that which it was impossible for them to do consistently with
the laws of the State defining and regulating their powers and
duties.
It is said that the record does not show that the Commissioners, prior to the order of the Secretary of War, suggested any
want of public moneys in their hands that could be used.in

RIDER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

altering the bridge or any want of power under the laws of the
State to raise money for such a purpose by taxation, within the
time limited for doing the work ordered. This is an immaterial circumstance. The Tecord does show that the Commissioners from the outset protested against the expense of the proposed alteration being put upon the county and insisted that the
United States, acting by its officers, having made that alteration necessary it should bear such expense. Ntothing done or
omitted to be done by the Commissioners estopped them from
making any defence which the facts in the case justified. The
liability of the Commissioners to criminal prosecution could not
depend upon their mere failure to state to the engineer in charge
of the Muskingum River improvements all that might have
been urged against the demand made upon them by that officer.
We are of opinion that, however broadly the act of 1890 may
be construed, it ought not to be construed as embracing officers
of a muncipal corporation owning or controlling a bridge who
had not in their hands, and under the laws of their State could
not obtain, public moneys that could be applied in execution of
the order of the Secretary of War within the time fixed by that
officer to complete the alteration of such bridge. If the court
on its own motion had instructed the jury, under the evidence
in this case, to find for the defendants, it could not be held to
have erred.
