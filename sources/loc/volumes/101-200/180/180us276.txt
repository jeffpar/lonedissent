LAMPASAS v. BELL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 115.

Argued December 3, 1900.-Decided February 11, 1901.

The ruling in Western Union Telegraph Company v. Ann Arbor Railroad
Company, 178 U. S. 239, that when a suit does not really and substantially
involve a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the
Constitution or laws of the United States, upon the determination of
which the result depends, it is not a suit under the Constitution and laws;
and that it must appear on the record, by a statement in legal and logical
form, such as is required in good pleading, that the suit is one which does
really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to a right
which depends on the construction of the Constitution, or some law or
treaty of the United States, before jurisdiction can be maintained on this
ground, is cited and followed.
The objection of the unconstitutionality of a statute must be made by one
having the right to make it, not by a stranger to its grievance.
As the city of Lampasas has no legal interest in the constitutional question
which it raised, and upon which it claims the right to come directly to
this court from the Circuit Court under the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,
to permit it to do so would make a precedent which would lead to the
destruction of the statute.
THIS suit was brought to recover the amount of certain unpaid
coupons for interest on "Lampasas City Water Work Bonds."
The main controversy on the merits depends upon whether the
plaintiff in error is the same municipal corporation which issued
the bonds or is its successor in liability. There are minor questions turning upon the provisions of ordinances and the observance of their requirements. Besides, a question under the
Constitution of the United States is claimed to have been raised

LAMPASAS v. BELL.
Statement of the Case.

in the Circuit Court by the plaintiff in error, and upon this is
based the right to bring the case here rather than take it to the
Circuit Court of Appeals. The facts are stipulated and are very
voluminous, but the view we take of the constitutional question
enables us to omit much detail.
The city of Lampasas was incorporated by special act of the
legislature in 1873, under the name of the " corporation of the
city of Lampasas," with boundaries containing an area of 553
acres. Its officers were to be elective, and consist of a mayor,
a board of aldermen of eight members, five of whom should constitute a quorum. Their term of office was to be two years and
until their successors should be elected and qualify. The act
made no provisions for the dissolving of the corporation. The
city was given power to construct water works, impose and collect taxes, not exceeding one per cent per annum, and to issue
bonds for public improvements.
Officers were elected, and the municipal government was exercised by them from 1873 to 1876. In 1876 a mayor and
aldermen were elected who favored abolishing the municipal
government. They formally resolved to resign and did so, and
abandoned their offices. What municipal government, if any,
existed between 1876 and 1883 the record does not show. It is,
however, stipulated that the city was the "county seat of Lampasas County and had a population in 1876 of about 800; that
until the year 1882 the said town was without railroad facilities,
when upon advent of a railroad it began to grow rapidly, and
by April, 1883, had a population of about 4500 people with
street railroad and other improvements. About 1S84 the population began to decline, and continued to decline until about
1890." Until 1882 the business part of the city was generally
confined to the court-house square and to streets laid out from
it and were within the territorial limits as originally incorporated. In 1882 and afterwards business houses were built outside of said limits but inside the boundaries as incorporated in
1883, hereinafter mentioned, and business has been transacted
there since.
In February, 1883, under the provisions of the general laws
of Texas, Title XVII of the Revised Statutes, a petition of

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

more than fifty qualified voters, living in and around the limits
of the city, was presented to the county judge who, in accordance with the prayer thereof', ordered an election to determine
whether the persons living within the limits in the petition
set out should incorporate as a city of more than 1000 inhabitants. The election was held, resulting in a majority vote for
incorporation - persons voting who lived inside and outside
of the limits of the special charter. Upon the return of the
election the county judge declared the result, and declared the
city duly incorporated within the limits petitioned for, which
embraced practically all of the lands within the special charter,
and extended nearly one half mile west, north and east thereof,
to and including the railroad depot-an area of 1495 acres.
A municipal government was organized with the officers
prescribed by the law-some of the aldermen residing outside
of the limits contained in the special charter-and exercised
all of the functions of a city of 1000 inhabitants organized under the general laws of the State, without any one contesting
or disputing the validity of its lawful right to do so, until November 4, 1889, when proceedings in the nature of quo warranto
were instituted to declare the incorporation of 18S3 invalid on
the ground that the special charter of 1873 had never been
repealed.
The suit was instituted without the direction of the attorney
general of the State or other executive officers, and without
making any of the creditors of the corporation parties. The
judgment of ouster was entered against the officers of the city,
which was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the
State.
aargen v. Texas, 76 Texas, 323.
The ousted officers thereafter ceased to act, and, upon authority of the county judge, officers were elected on the 22d of
March, 1890, as provided in the charter of 1873, and by persons living within the limits defined by said charter, and the
mayor and aldermen so elected organized March 19, and on
the 22d by unanimous vote resolved to accept the provisions of
" Title XVII of the IRevised Statutes of the State of Texas in
lieu of the charter granted by the legislature." A copy of the
resolutions was duly certified and recorded, as required by law,

LAMPASAS v. BELL.
Statement of the Case.

and the city at once assumned to act under the general charter
provided in Title XVII, and is now acting thereunder.
On December 26, 1890, there was added to the city by a vote
of the citizens of the added territory a greater part of the lands
west which were included within the limits of 1883, and one
tier of blocks additional and the city assumed, and has since
exercised jurisdiction over that part lying north and east of the
limits of 1873, and which was included within the limits of 1883.
The area added contained 428 acres, and embraced the greater
part of the residence property of the city outside of the original
charter limits of 1873. The property lying north and east of
the original limits, and not included within the incorporation
of 1890, contains seventy-seven residence houses, occupied by
persons, ninety per cent of whom follow some kind of business
within the town as defined by the limits of 1873.
The books and papers of the city government under the charters of 1873 and 1883 were lost, except the assessment rolls of
1889, from which it appears that the assessed value of all lands
within the city limits of 1889 was $664,420, personal property
about $400,000, and that the assessment was divided as follows:
As to lands, no division being shown as to personal property, viz.,
within the limits of 1873, $452,444; within that part added in
December, 1890, $157,915; and within the parts north and
east, $68,970. The assessment roll also showed the names of
438 voters, divided as follows: Old limits of 1873, 175; part
added in December, 1890, 167; parts north and east, 96.
In January, 1885, acting under the then charter, and not under the charter of 1873, the city, in good faith, upon the demand
of the business men of the city for fire protection, and to furnish water to the city, then having a population of 4500, determined to build a system of water works, and to pay for the
same by the sale of bonds, and to this end, after full and fair
discussion, passed the ordinances under which the bonds in controversy were issued.
The other facts relate to the passage of the ordinance providing
for the building of the water works for which the bonds were
issued; the advertisement of bids under the ordinance; the inability of the city to get other than cash bids; the awarding, in

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

consequence, of the contract to a bidder who was willing to
build a system for $40,000, whereas the actual cost of the work,
allowing nothing for profits to the contractor, was $26,276;
the location of the works, some portion being shown to be inside the limits of the new incorporation, and some portion outside such limits; the payment of interest on the bonds for 1889;
the decision of the city in 1892 by vote to take charge of the
public schools and maintain them, and in 1893 to build a school
building, and the issuing of bonds therefor amounting to $18,000,
bearing interest at six per cent, and by the proceeds of which a
school building was erected, it being believed and the fact certified to the state comptroller that the city had no outstanding
bonds; the form of the bonds and their indorsements, and the
formalities of their execution, and what appeared as to their
registration in the office of the state comptroller, and what
appeared as to the assessed value of the property of the city.
It was also stipulated that the defendant in error is the owner
and holder of 102 coupons, each for the sum of $35, maturing
at different dates, which coupons except as to due date and number of bond are of the following form:
$35.
"$35.
The City of Lampasas
will pay the bearer thirty-five dollars at the office of S. M.
Swenson & Son, in the city of New York, or at the treasurer's
189-, beoffice, in the city of Lampasas, on the 1st day of -,
ing six months' interest on bond No. "S. S. POTTS, Secretary."
And it was further stipulated that of those coupons, "fortytwo in number, being numbers 9 to 15, inclusive, on bonds
Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, became due more than four years before
the institution of this suit, and if plaintiff is entitled to recover
in this action he is entitled to recover the sum of $2100 principal and $452.70 interest, due on the remaining sixty coupons
mentioned in his petition."
From the facts the Circuit Court found the following:
"That within the city of Lampasas, as now organized and as
it has existed since 1890, there is embraced substantially all of
the persons and property embraced within the limits of said city

Opinion of the Court.

as it existed under the charter adopted in 1883 by vote of the
people, and which was recognized and acted upon by them as a
valid city government from its adoption until the quo warranto
proceedings against Largen and his associate officers in 1889,
during which time the officers assuming to act as officers under
said general charter were elected in good faith by all persons
residing within the limits of the charter of 1883, and as such
officers in good faith discharged the duties of their respective
offices without dispute by any person residing within the restricted limits of the charter of 1873 or by persons living outside of the same."
And as conclusions of law found:
"1. The coupons in suit constitute a valid and existing liability against the present city of Lampasas, except that coupons
Nos. 9 to 15, inclusive, being 42 in number, are barred by the statute of limitation, and the remaining 60 coupons sued upon, not
being barred by the statute, are valid, and the defendant should
be required to pay the same. S/apleigh v. San Angelo, 167
U. S. 646; City of 1a?.pasas v. Talcott, decided by Circuit
Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, on the - day of ,18-.
"2. Judgment is therefore rendered in favor of the plaintiff
against the defendant, the city of Lampasas, for the sum of
$2552.70, with interest thereon, at the rate of six per cent per
annum, from the date hereof, and all costs of suit. To the judgment rendered and the additional conclusion of fact the defendant in open court excepts."

MR.JUSTIoE McKNNA delivered the opinion of the court.
The principle and contention of the assignments of error,

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

which are based on the Constitution of the United States, are
expressed in the fourth assignment, as follows:
"The court erred in its last conclusion of facts, its conclusions
of law, and the judgment rendered thereon because the organization formed in 1883 under and by virtue of which the bonds,
the coupons of which are sued on, were issued, was not only
voidable, but wholly void, for the reason that such organization
was attempted to be formed under the general laws of the State
of Texas, with power to levy and collect taxes, which general
laws of the State of Texas then in force and embraced in
Title XVII of the Revised Statutes of 1879, relating to the
formation of municipal corporations, and the levy and collection
of taxes thereby, were in violation of section I of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in that
the boundaries of such corporations were not fixed by the legislature, nor do said statutes make any provisions by which said
boundaries can be fixed by any tribunal or official before whom
the residents of the territory proposed to be incorporated could
be heard as to whether they should be included in or made subject to taxation in the proposed corporation."
The same claim was made in substantially the same words in
the answer of the plaintiff in error in the court below, and the
specific injury alleged was "that the taxpayers residing withirn
the boundaries fixed by said act of 1873 will be required to pay
more than one half of the principal and interest due and to
become due on said bonds, whereby they will be deprived of
their property without due process of law."
This court has only jurisdiction by appeal or writ of error
directly from the Circuit Court in certain cases, one of which is
when " the Constitution or law of a State is claimed to be in
contravention of the Constitution of the United States." See. 5
of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 828.
But the claim must be real and substantial. A mere claim in
words is not enough. We said by the Chief Justice in Western
Unmon Telegraph Co. v. Ann Arbor Railroad, 178 U. S.239:
" When a suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States, upon the determination

LAMPASAS v. BELL.
Opinion of the Court.

of which the result depends, it is not a suit arising under the
Constitution or laws. And it must appear on the record, by a
statement in legal and logical form, such as is required in good
pleading, that the suit is one which does really and substantially
involve a dispute or controversy as to a right which depends on
the construction of the Constitution or some law or treaty of
the United States, before jurisdiction can be maintained on this
ground. Gold Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 199;
Blackburn v. Portland Gold Xining Co., 175 U. S. 571."
It is contended that the residents of the territory incorporated
in 1883, were not given an opportunity to be heard "whether
they should or should not be included in or made subject to
taxation in the proposed corporation." It is hence deduced
that the incorporation of 1883 was wholly void and in consequence the bonds sued on were also wholly void, because the
,law of the State under which the incorporation was made, to
wit, Title 17 of the Revised Statutes of 1879, relating to the
formation of municipal corporations, and the levy and collection
of taxes thereby, was in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. But what
concern is it of the plaintiff in error whether the residents of
such territory were or were not given an opportunity to be
heard? It had no proprietary right or interest in "territory
proposed to be incorporated;" it was put to no hazard of taxation without a hearing, nor can it stand in judgment for those
who had such interest or were put to such hazard. It was certainly the right of the residents of the territory to submit to
incorporation and accept its burdens and its benefits. And the
record shows that there was no question of its validity for
six years. When questioned it was not on the ground that it
was incorporated under an unconstitutional statute-not on the
ground that it was imposed without a hearing on unwilling subjects-but on the ground that the prior incorporation of 1873
had not ceased to exist.
We said in Clarc v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114, (quoting
from Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, section 196,) that "'a
court will not listen to an objection made to the constitutionality of an act by a party whose rights it does not affect, and

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
Syllabus.

who has therefore no interest in defeating it.'" That is, a legal
interest in defeating it. The objection of unconstitutionality
of a statute must be made by one having the right to make it,
not by a stranger to its grievance. "To this extent only is it
necessary to go, in order to secure and protect the rights of all
persons, against the unwarranted exercise of legislative power,
and to this extent only, therefore, are courts of justice called
Vellington, Petitioner, 16 Pick. 87, 96.
on to interpose."
It follows necessarily that the plaintiff in error has no legal
interest in the constitutional question which it raised, and upon
which it claims the right to come directly to this court from
the Circuit Court under section 5 of the act of 1891, supra.
To permit it to come here directly from the Circuit Court
would make a precedent which would lead to the destruction of
the statute. We repeat, the questions which can be raised under
any of the subdivisions of section 5 of the act must be real, the"
controversies they present must be substantial, not only from
the nature of the principles invoked, but from the relation of
the party to them by whom they are invoked.
Writ of error dismissed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 138. Argued December 21, 1900.-Decided February 25, 1901,

This is a case in which a court of equity is called upon to decide upon
which of two innocent parties is to fall a loss occasioned by the dishonesty of a third person. On the facts as stated by the court, it appears
thatthe relation thatexisted between Thompson, the executor of Dr. Saul
who left a legacy to the Missionary Society, and that society was that of
executor and legatee; that the relation between Thompson and Holly, the
purchaser of the estate sold by the executor, was that of attorney and client;
and that as between themselves, Holly and the society were absolute
strangers. The court, on the facts, holds that the pleadings and evi-
