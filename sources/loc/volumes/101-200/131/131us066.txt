OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Counsel fdr Parties.

All of these cases were tried by the court without a jury,
by agreement of the parties, as alleged in the record; but
there is no allegation that the stipulation was in writing, as
required by the statute; and, under the ruling in Bond v.
Dustin, 112 U. S. 60-, and .Dundee .Mortgage Com,patny v.
Hghes, 124-U. S. 157, no error can be examined in the rulings
of the court at the trial. We can only inquire whether the
declarations were respectively sufficient to sustain the judgments. As there appears to be no error in this regard, the
judgments are severally

ABENDROTH v. VAN DOLSEN.
ERROR TO THE CITY COURT OF NEW YORK.
No. 229. Argued April 12,13, 1889. - Decided May 13, 1889.

The connection of the plaintiff in error with the partnership of Griffith &
Wundram was not a matter in issue in the proceedings in bankruptcy
against that firm.
An adjudication of the bankruptcy of a firm, and of the members in whose
name the firm was doing business, in a bankrupt proceeding affecting
them alone, to which a special partner was not a party, does not estop a
copartnership creditor from setting up the liability of such special partner, imposed upon him by the statute, for non-compliance with its provisions.
A special partner in a partnership, who is not a party to proceedings in
bankruptcy against the partnership and the general members of it, is not
entitled to the stay of proceedings provided for in Rev. Stat. ยง 5118, until
the question of the debtor's discharge shall have been determined.
A discharge of two generhl partners in bankruptcy cannot be set up in
favor of a special partner in an action against the tbree as general partners on the ground that the special partner has. made himself liable as
a general partner.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

ABENDROTH v. VAi DOLSEN.
Opinion of the Court.
Mia. JuSTICE

LrAn delivered the opinion of the court.

This writ of error brings before the court for review a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for the city and county
of New York, affirming, on appeal, a judgment of the City
Court of New York. The former is, under the New York
Code of Civil Procedure, the highest court of the State to
which a decision of the latter court may, as a matter of right,
be carried by appeal for reversal or affirmance. The Federal
question involved relates to the construction of the Bankrupt
Act of March 2, 1867.
On the 18th of June, 1877, the defendants in error filed in
the Marine Court of the city of New York, now known as the
City Court of New York, a complaint against William P.
Abendroth, John Griffith and George W. Wundram, in which
they alleged "that at the times hereinafter mentioned the defendants were copartners in business, carrying on such business in the city of New York under the firm name and style
of Griffith & Wundram; that on or about the 7th day of
August, 1872, at the city of New York, the said defendants,
in and under their said firm name of Griffith & Wundram,.
made their certain promissory note in writing, bearing date
on that day, whereby they promised, three months after the
date thereof, to pay to the order of Van Dolsen & Arnott,
these plaintiffs, the sum of nine hundred , dollars, and thereupon delivered said note to these plaintiffs; that plaintiffs are
the holders and owners of said note, and the said note is wholly
unpaid; wherefore plaintiffs demand judgment against the
defendants for the sum of nine hundred ,3 dollars, .with interest from the 10th day of November, 1872, and for the costs
of this action."
The defendant Abendroth alone appeared and filed his
answer, which, after denying the partnership as alleged in the
complaint, set up as a further defence that it was a limited
partnership under the name of Griffith & Wundram, of which
Griffith and Wundram were the general partners and he a
special partner only, and as such special partner entitled, under
the statutes of New York, to exemption from liability for engagements of the firm as a general partner.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

For a third defence he pleaded, in bar and abatement, that,
prior to the commencement of the suit, certain bankruptcy
proceedings had been instituted in the District Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York, in bankruptcy, wherein an adjudication of bankruptcy 6f the said
firm of Griffith & Wundram was duly rendered by said court,
and wherein it was also declared and adjudged that said John
Griffith and George W. Wundram, the bankrupts in said bankruptcy, were the general partners, and the defendant, Abendroth, was the special partner thereof.
The case was tried before a jury, which, under the direction
of the court, found in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount
claimed, with interest, and judgment was entered accordingly.
Upon appeal the judgment was affirmed. To reverse that
affirmance this writ of error was sued out.
From the evidence in this case it appears that, on the 23d of
December, 1870, Abendroth, Griffith and Wundram formed a
limited partnership under the statutes of New York, under the
firm name of Griffith & Wundram, in wihich Griffith and
Wundram were designated the general partners and Abendroth the special partner. All the requirements of the statute,
as to the signing and publication of the articles, filing of the
certificate and affidavit and publishing the same, were strictly
complied with, except that the capital contributed by the
special partner was not paid in cash, as stated in the affidavit,
but by a post-dated check payable eight days after its execution, and cashed in ten days from its date, the day after the
firm went into business. Such misstatement in the affidavit
was held by the Court of Appeals of that State to render the
special partner liable as a general partner for the engagements
of the firm, under the following provision of the statute
authorizing the formation of limited partnerships:
"And if any false statement be made in such certificate
or affidavit all the persons interested in such partnership shall
be liable for all the engagements thereof as general partners."
On the 30th of November, 1872, Wundram presented his
petition in bankruptcy to the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York, setting forth

ABEITDROTH v. VA_N DOLSEN.
Opinion of the Court.

that he was a member of the copartnership consisting of himself and John Griffith, carrying on business under the firm
name of Griffith & Wundram within that judicial district;
that the members of said copartnership were, jointly and
severally, unable to pay their debts; and with the other
averments usual in such petitions. The usual schedules were
annexed to the petition. No mention was made of Ab6ndroth
in the petition, but in the schedule he was stated to be one of
the creditors of the firm, as were also the defendants in error
here, Van Dolsen & Arnott. Upon this petition an order was
issued requiring Griffith to show cause, etc. It contained no
reference to Abendroth, and was not directed to him nor
served upon him. After due proof of service on Griffith, the
adjudication in bankruptcy was made in these words: "It is
adjudged that John Griffith and George W. Wundram and
the copartnership of Griffith & Wundram became bankrupt
before the filing of the petition, and they are therefore declared and adjudged bankrupts accordingly."
It is proper to note here that in this adjudication there is no
reference to Abendroth as a partner, either general or special;
and no designation of the firm as a limited .partnership. The
usual warrant of seizure of the estate of the bankrupt, the
assignment of assets to the register in bankruptcy, the notice
to creditors, and the first meeting of the creditors, all followed
in the regular order of such proceedings. Abendroth was
chosen by the creditors as assignee in bankruptcy3 and accepted the office, with the approval of the judge. Upon the
face of the return it appears that Van Dolsen and Arnott did
not take any part in the selection of the assignee. At the
second meeting of the creditors Joseph McDonald & Co., creditors of the bankrupts, presented a petition to the register in
bankruptcy, setting forth that two days before the filing of
the petition in bankruptcy certain of the creditors had agreed
to sell their claims to Abendroth at twenty-five cents on the
dollar, had afterwards proved their debts in bankruptcy, and
had then assigned the same to Abendroth.. They asked that
Abendroth should not receive any dividend upon said assigned
claims, and that the proof of them should be expunged, and
the claims disallowed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

An order was made for a hearing on the petition before the
register, five days' notice being first given to the creditors
whose claims were thus opposed. Van Dolsen and Arnott
were not among such creditors, and it is not contended that
they received the notice above mentioned. The register having heard the case, made his report to the bankruptcy court,
in which he presented the questions that came before him;
among others, whether the debts assigned to Abendroth should
be disallowed because he was a special partner in the bankruptcy firm, the petitioners relying upon a provision of the
statutes of New York, in relation to limited partnerships, that
no special partner, except in particular cases, therein specified,
could be allowed to claim as creditor, in case of the bankruptcy
of the partnership, until the claims of all the other creditors
of the partnership should be satisfied. The register reported
his opinion to be that, in respect to these assigned claims,
Abendroth stood in the shoes of his assignors, and was a creditor as their representative, and in no other character. Upon
this report of the register, the judge of the District Court
adjudged that Abendroth was entitled to receive a dividend
on the assigned claims, and that they ought not to be expunged
or diminished. It appears that Abendroth and McDonald &
Co. have both proved debts, but that Van Dolsen and Arnott
were not among the creditors making such proofs.
The counsel for plaintiff in error does not contend that this
court should disregard the construction which the courts of
New York have given to the statutes of that State authorizing
the formation of limited partnerships; nor does he deny that
Abendroth incurred, at the formation of the partnership, a
statutory liability for the debts of the firm, by the misstatement in the affidavit respecting the time and manner of putting in his capital as a special partner. But he contends that
the plaintiffs are estopped from setting up this liability by the
proceedings in bankruptcy, above recited, which he claims had
the effect of an adjudication binding upon them that no such
liability existed. This contention involves two propositions:
first, that as Wundram's petition against Griffith alleged that
the two, Griffith and Wundram, composed the firm, it clearly

ABENDROTH v. VAN DOLSEN.
Opinion of the Court.

meant that they were all of the copartners; and that accordingly the adjudication must be held to have been an adjudication of the fact that Abendroth was not a member of the firm.
We have seen that through the entire proceedings in bankruptcy, from the inception to the adjudication, inclusive, nothing appears affirmatively or negatively with regard to Abendroth's membership of the firm, no reference to him of any
kind in the adjudication, and nothing in regard to him, except
as a creditor in the schedule annexed to the petition. We
concur in the opinion of the court below that the connection
of Abendroth with the partnership was not a matter in issue,
nor a point in controversy upon the determination of which
the adjudication was rendered.
An adjudication in bankruptcy partakes in part of the
nature of a judgment in 'em, and in part of the nature of a
judgment in personamr. With regard to the estate of the
bankrupt debtor, which has been by the court's warrant of
seizure, or by the surrender of the debtor, brought within the
possession and jurisdiction of the court, its orders, decrees, and
judgments as to the right and title to the property, or as to
the disposition of it among the parties interested, are binding
upon all persons and in every court. As a determination of
the legal status of the bankrupt, or of the relations of the
creditors to both, its judgment is conclusive in all courts where
it is pleaded. But as a determination of the legal status of a
person not a bankrupt, and who was not a party to the proceeding, and whose status as a bankrupt has never been a
question before the court, it unquestionably is not binding
upon any person not a party to such proceeding. In the cases
cited by the counsel for plaintiff in error, the adjudication
either determined the legal status of the bankrupt debtor or
related to the bankrupt estate brought within the jurisdiction
of the court. In this case the petition neither asserted nor
denied that Abendroth was a member of the bankrupt firm.
No process was served upon him to show whether he was or
was not such member; nor did he himself voluntarily appear
and petition to be declared the one or the other.
In our opinion an adjudication of the bankruptcy of a firm,

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

and of the members in whose name the firm was doing business, in a bankrupt proceeding affecting thein alone, to which
a special partner was not a party, does not estop a copartnership creditor from setting up the liability of such special partner imposed upon him by the statute for non-compliance with
its provisions.
The second ground involved in the contention of the plaintiff in error is, that there was, in the subsequent proceedings
before the register, an express adjudication that Abendroth
was a special partner and not a general partner; and that this
adjudication was binding upon all the creditors, including the
plaintiffs below in this action. We think this contention untenable. The question before the register in that proceeding was,
whether the proof of the claims referred to should be expunged, and the dividends upon them disallowed to Abendroth.
In his report to the court he expresses his opinion to be that
neither the fact that Abendroth was the assignee in bankruptcy, nor the fact that he was a special partner in the firm,
precluded him from drawing his share of dividends in the
claims referred to. This was certainly not an adjudication by
the court that he was a special partner. The district judge in
the order made by him did not pass on any question discussed
in the report of the register, except his conclusion that the
claims assigned to Abendroth, as aforesaid, ought not to be
expunged or diminished, and that he was entitled to the dividends on them; and he so ordered. The order, relating as it
did exclusively to a question as to the distribtftion of the assets
of the firm, contained no feature of an adjudication with
respect to Abendroth's copartnership. Indeed, it is manifest
from an examination of the register's report that he did not
consider that the question as to whether Abendroth was or
was not a special partner had any material bearing on the
question as to how the money in the hands of the assignee
should be distributed among the creditors. In either case he
considered that the claim should not be expunged or diminished. But even if, for the sake of argument, we concede that
this last order of the judge was in effect an adjudication that
Abendroth was a special partner, there is nothing in the judg-

Opinion of the Court.

ment of the court below which denies its validity. The latter
judgment also holds Abendroth to be a special partner, and as
such liable, under the statute, in the same manner that he
would be if he were a general partner. This is shown in the
opinion of the court, which very properly holds that the statute, in fixing this liability on account of non-compliance with
its provisions, does not change his special partnership into a
general one, but simply makes him liable as a general partner
to creditors. All his relations to his copartners, and their
obligations growing out of their relation to him as a special
partner, remain unimpaired. If before the firm became bankrupt he had been, under his statutory liability, forced to pay
a bill or note, or other general debt of the firm, be would have
been entitled to indemnity from his partners, and could have
recovered back from them the amount, with legal interest
thereon. The view presented by the Court of Appeals of New
York upon this point, in the case of .Duratnt v. Abendroth., 97
New York, 132, 144, is clear and satisfactory:
"Notwithstanding the erroneous statement in the affidavit
as to the payment of the capital, the partnership was, in form,
a limited partnership, and subject to all the rules applicable to
such partnerships. If it had uhdertaken to make an assignment with preferences, such assignment could not have been
sustained on the ground of the violation of the statute. That
violation could be taken advantage of only by creditors, and
its consequence simply was to give them recourse against the
special partner personally, as if he had been a general
partner."
Another ground relied on for reversal is, that the pendency
of the proceedings in bankruptcy is a good plea in abatement
of this action. Section 5106 of the Revised Statutes, cited in
support of this proposition, formerly ยง 21 of the act of March
2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 526, provides that "no creditor whose
debt is provable shall be allowed to prosecute to final judgment any suit at law or in equity therefor against the bankrupt, until the question of the debtor's discharge shall have
been determined; and any such suit or proceedings shall, upon
the application of the bankrupt, be stayed to await the deter-

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

mination of the court in bankruptcy on the question of the
discharge."
It is only necessary to say that Abendroth was in no sense
the bankrupt in those proceedings, nor was he endeavoring to
obtain his discharge as a bankrupt debtor in any proceedings
in bankruptcy pending at the time this action was commenced. He is not entitled, therefore, to any stay of proceedings which the statute, by its own express terms, provides exclusively .for the protection of the bankrupt.
The only remaining point relied on by plaintiff in error as a
ground for reversal of the judgment below is, that the defendants were sued in the action as general partners, and the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs determined that they were,
general partners; and that the adjudication in bankruptcy of
Griffith and Wundram was a judgment against the two
partners, which is a bar to any action subsequently brought
by the creditor against the two defendants as such general
partners. Against this view there is, we think, an insuperable
objection. By ยง 5118 of the Revised Statutes, formerly ยง 33
of the act of Mlarch 2, 1861, c. 176, 14: Stat. 533, the rule of
the common law, as declared by this court in M1ason v.
Eld'ed, 6 Wall. 231, that a'judgment against one upon a
contract, merely joint, of several persons, bars an action
against the others on the same contract, is rendered entirely
inapplicable to adjudications in bankruptcy. That section
provides: "Io discharge shall release, discharge, or affect any
person liable for the same debt for or with the bankrupt,
either as partner, joint contractor, indorser, surety, or otherwise."
If the discharge of the two bankrupt partners, which is the
final judgment in the proceedings, cannot estop the creditor
from afterwards setting up the liability of the third partner
for the joint debt, clearly the other and previous adjudication
in the course of the proceedings cannot be held to have that
effect. Though the action in the court below was brought
against the three defendants, the jury was directed by the court
to render its verdict against Abendroth alone, and the judgment
was entered up against him alone, thus fully recognizing the
