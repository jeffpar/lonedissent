article known in trade as "watch enamel" was dutiable at 40
per cent ad valorem, under the last clause of schedule B of
section 2504 of the Revised Statutes, as "manufactures of
glass, or of which glass shall be a component material, not
otherwise provided for," or to a duty of 25 per cent ad valorem
as "watch materials," under schedule X of section 2504: and
it was held that the article was not a manufacture of glass,
but was dutiable as "watch materials." But in that case it is
stated that the article there in question .was known to the
trade as "watch enamel," and was used only, so far as was
disclosed by the evidence, for enamelling the faces or dials of
watches. It does not appear by the report of that ca~e
whether or not there was any earmark upon the imported
article to indicate its proposed use. That case was not, in its
facts, at all like the present one, and this case must be decided
upon the facts shown by the record.
Judgment afJrmed.

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
APPEAL

FROM THE OCRUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTEI
DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 852. Argued October 27, 28, 29, 1890. -Decided

March 9,1891.

The judgment at law on which the bill in this case is based, absolved the
,defendant from any primary obligation of debtor to creditor, and left it
chargeable only as trustee of a fund out of which plaintiff's claim was to
be paid; and it was unquestionably correct.
To the extent that the city of New Orleans may be considered as such a
trustee, it is a compulsory trustee by force of the legislation of 1871,
and not a voluntary and contractual trustee, and its responsibility should
be restricted to the narrowest limits.
In failing to collect the uncollected assessments, the city was guilty of no
dereaction of duty as trustee.
The various assessment proceedings, taken in connection with the decision
of the Snpreme Court approving the homologation of the tableaux, may
have operated, if not to cast a specific lien upon the streets and other
-public grounds, at least to charge upon the city an obligation to the
drainage fund for a proportionate share of the total cost of the drainage;

Statement of the Case.
but the city has, by its issues of city bonds in exchange for warrants,
paid an amount on account of -drainage far in excess of all the assessments charged against it, and nothing is due from it as trustee on this
account.
By the purchase of the property of the canal company under the act of
February 4, 1876, the city did not assume the duty of completing the contemplated work, and did not incur any responsibility for injuries resulting from its non-completion.
A municipality which abandons a contemplated work of -public improvement, assumes thereby no obligation to parties who have invested on the
faith and expectation of beaefit from the completion of the work.
When a contract for local improvements in a municipality is entered'into,
the contractor must look to the special assessments, and to them alone,
for his compensation, and if they fail, without dereliction or wrong upon
the part of the corporation, neither justice nor equity will tolerate that
It be charged as debtor therefor.

Ox-March 18, 1858, the State of Louisiana passed an act to
levee, drain and reclaim certain lands situate in the parishes of
Orleans and Jefferson, comprising the cities of New Orleans,
Jefferson and Carrollton, the whole area thereof being 26,026
acres. These lands were separated into three districts, entitled
draining districts. To carry this act into effect a board of commissioners was appointed for each district. They were given
full power to do the work, each in its district. Payment was
provided for in this way: The commissioners were to prepare
a plan of the district to be drained, showing the work to be
done, the subdivision of the ground into lots, blocks, etc., with
the names of the several owners thereof, and to deposit such
plans in the office of the recorder of mortgages in the parish in
which the lands were situated. After publication the several
District Courts within whose jurisdiction the lands to be
drained were situated were directed to decree that each portion
of the property situated within the limits mentioned in the
notices is subject to a first mortgage lien and privilege in favor
of such. board of commissioners for such amount as might be
assessed upon the property for its proportion of the cost of
draining, with interest thereon at six per centum per annum
from demand thereof. The decree was to be recorded.in the
office of the recorder of mortgages, and the lien and privilege
mentioned therein were declared to "take precedence over all

Statement of the Case.

mortgages, liens and privileges whatsoever, whether tacit, conventional, legal or judicial, and shall attach to said property
until the amount assessed and the interest thereon shall have
been paid in full." The commissioners were thereafter to levy
such uniform assessments upon the superficial or square foot
within the drainage section as might be necessary for payment
of the work. This statute also provided, that, on non-payment
ofthe assessment, judgment might be recovered therefor in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and the land so assessed sold
according to law. An appropriation of eighty-one thousalid
dollars of. the swamp-land fund was made by the legislature,
for the purpose of aiding in carrying out the -purposes of
this statute. By a supplementary statute, of March 17, 1859,
the several boards of commissioners were authorized to issue
bonds, to be designated draining bonds. By these bonds it
was contemplated that money should be raised at once for the
payment of the work, in anticipation of the collection of the
assessments. On March 1, 1861, another statute was passed,
providing a summary remedy for the collection of these assessments. This statute declared that the homologation of the
tableaux of assessment should operate as a judgment against
the property assessed, and the owners thereof, on which execution might issue as on judgments rendered in the ordinary
mode of proceeding. Some work was done under these statutes, by the direction of the commissioners, but the exact
amount is not disclosed, though evidently but an inconsiderable fragment of that which was contemplated. The boards of
commissioners made plans and assessments in their several districts, as required.. The assessment rolls were approved, and
homologated, and judgments rendered against the parcels of
land and the owners thereof as the same were described in the
assessment rolls. As the assessment was to be upon the superficial foot, obviously within the limits of the city. of New
Orleans, some -portion of the assessment would rest upon the
streets and other public grounds; and in the tableaux the city
of New Orleans was named as the owner thereof, and judgments were rendered against it, as owner, for sums amounting
in the several districts to $719,926.63.

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Statement of the Case.

On March 2, 1869, an act was passed to repeal the laws
creating the draining districts, and turning over to the mayors
of the cities of New Orleans, Jefferson and Carrollton, and to
the police jury of the parish of Jefferson, the control of the
work and the possession of the property. Nothing seems to
have been done under this act, and it is significant only as a
declaration of the legislature of the failure of the boards theretofore created under prior statutes. On March 16, 1870, an
act was passed uniting the cities of New Orleans and Jefferson
into one city-the city of New Orleans.
On February 24, 1871, the legislature passed an act entitled
"An act to provide for the drainage of New Orleans." This
act empowered the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal
Company to excavate draining canals and build protection
levees within the corporate limits of New Orleans and Carrollton. The location of these levees and canals, whether large
or small, was to-be designated by the board of administrators
of New Orleans, and all lands -to be acquired for such purposes were to be held by such board for the benefit of that
city. To provide funds for paying for this work, all property
and rights acquired and held under prior statutes, by drainage
commissioners or others, for the purposes of carrying into
effect the drainage system, including therein real estate, plans,
books and all uncollected assessments, were transferred to the
board of administrators of the city of New Orleans; and all
assessments theretofore made were confirmed, and ih addition
the board was authorized to make an assessment of two mills
per superficial foot upon the lands within the draining districts.
The statute also provided that all moneys so collected should
be placed to the credit of the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf
Ship Canal Company, and held as funds to be applied only for
the drainage in accordance with the provisions of the act, and
held in trust for the payment of such company, and ultimately
for the benefit of the city of New Orleans should the same not
be required for the purposes of drainage. The act also provided the price that should be paid - fifty cents per cubic yard
-for the work to be done. In pursuance of this act, W. H.
Bell, the surveyor of the city of New Orleans, devised a scheme

Statement of the Case.

for draining the lands, and prepared a plan of the work, which
-was entitled "chart of draining sections of New Orleans, showing present canals, with proposed protection levees and reservoir canals, May, 1872." He made an estimate of the cost
which, after itemizing different portions, closed with the statement that "the whole work ought not to cost over three millions of dollars." On April 21, 1871, the city council, of the
city of New Orleans passed an ordinance, (ordinance No. 814,)
which recited that the provisions of the act of 1871 made it
mandatory upon the council to provide for an extensive system
of drainage, and to recognize the claims and accounts of and
make settlements with the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship
Canal Company for performing such work; and that the city
council deemed certain portions of said act unconstitutional as
depriving it of its proper control of the drainage system, and
of its right voluntarily to contract for the work and agree on
the price therefor; yet, in view of the importance of the work
and the needs of the city, it ordained that "all matters appertaining to drainage, and the protection of the city from inundation, be placed under the immediate charge of the administrator of improvements, aided by the city surveyor," and
directed a plan to be made, etc., of the work. Section 4 reads
as follows: "The city shall issue warrants for the payment of
the work as required by the act of the legislature, and in case
of non-realization or non-collection of assets provided' for
therein, the same to bear eight per cent per annum interest;
the said warrants to be issued with the understanding, to be
inscribed therein or endorsed thereon, that they shall not be
enforceable by suit and judgment, but if not paid within one
year out of the proceeds of the draining tax and assets they
shall be fundable in bonds of the city, bearing eight per cent
interest, payable semi-annually, having ten years to run, and
with due provision for retiring the same, and securing the
punctual payment of interest and gradual extinction of the
principal. The city shall have power to sell said bonds or give
the same in payment of the work. performed; but no sale or
exchange shall be made at a price less than eighty cents on
the dollar, exclusive of interest, and any holder of any fundable

Statement of the Case.

warrant, after thirty days' notice, if not paid in money, may
demand bonds for the same at eighty cents on the dollar."
On April 26, 1872, an act was passed by the legislature
making provisions for the debt of the city of New Orleans.
Section 13 reads as follows: "That for unbonded debts existing December 31, 1871, and unpaid at the time of the passage
of this act, or caused by receipts of certificates of 1871, for,
revenues proper of 1872, and for excavations and levees, drainage machinery and revetments authorized by law or required
for the protection of the city from overflow or inundation, the
city may issue from time to time, as they may be required,
bonds of the denominations of five hundred and one thousand
dollars, having fifty years to run, and bearing seven per cent
interest, principal and interest payable in gold in New York
and New Orleans, and at any other points that the council
may designate, with quarterly codpons, and that the bonds thus
issued shall be called the new consolidated debt of New Orleani. No bonds shall be issued but by authority of the council, nor for a lower rate than ninety cents on the dollar. All
issued for excavations and levees authorized by act No. 30 of
1871, or by drainage laws previously enacted, shall be marked
'drainage series,' and all taxes collected for drainage, and not
required for the payment of drainage warrants, shall be devoted to the purchase from the lowest bidder of bonds issued
for drainage; no bid to be accepted above par, and the right
reserved to the council to reject all unsatisfactory bids."
The canal company entered upon its work, but, becoming
embarrassed, on 'May 22, 1872, assigned all its rights to Warren Van Norden. By statute of March 23, 1874, the city of
Carrollton was annexed to the city of New Orleans, so that
the whole drainage district came within the limits of the
latter city. The canal company, or its assignee, proceeded
with the work, continuing it from July 21, 1871, to May 26,
1876. By January 1, 1875, the cost of the work performed
amounted to $1,713,635.35. During that time the city officials
issued drainage warrants to the amount of $1,422,263.69, and
the holders of the warrants exchanged them for bonds endorsed
"new consolidated gold bonds, drainage series," at ninety

Statement of the Case.

cents on the dollar. On January 1, 1875, by amendni6nt to
the constitution of the State, the city of New Orleans was forbidden to increase its municipal debt, in any manner or form,
or under any pretext. This amendment in terms allowed the
exchange of old for new bonds, permitted the issue of drainage warrants, payable only from drainage taxes, and not otherwise. On February 24, 1876, an act of the legislature was
passed authorizing the purchase by the city from the canal
company and its assignee of all their rights, under prioi statutes, and all tools, implements and machinery in their possession or belonging to.them, and the payment fok the same in
drainage warrants of the same character and payable in the
same way as those provided in the act of 1871. At that time
the work done by the company and its assignee amounted to
$2,242,514.78. On June 7, 1876, the city of New Orleans pullchased, as 'authorized, the rights and property above described,
the consideration for the same being three hundred thousand
dollars in drainage warrants. Little, if any, work was done thereafter bythe city, and the abandonment of the work resulted in
largely destroying the value of that whichhad been done, the
rusting and decay of the machinery and tools, and the inundation and overflow of the portions of the lands attempted to be
drained. The complainant being a 5bonaflde holder of some
of the warrants issued to the canal company after the passag
of this constitutional amendment above referred to, commenced
his action at law and recovered a judgment, which reads as
follows: "It is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, James Wallace Peake, do have and recover of and from
the defendant, the city of New Orleans, as provided by act
No. 30 of 1871, as successor of the drainage commissioners
established under acts 165 of 1858 and 191 of 1859, and the
various acts of the. legislature of Louisiana supplementary
thereto and amendatory thereof, the sum of six thousand dollars ($6000) with eight per cent interest thereon from July 9,
1875, and costs of suit, both the sum recovered and costs of
suit to be paid out of said.drainage fund."
Thereafter this bill was filed in behalf of himself, as well as
all other parties interested.

MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after stating the facts as above,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The bill in equity in this case was based on the judgment at
law. That judgment determined the direct liabilities between
the parties. It absolved the defendant from any primary
obligation of debtor to creditor. It left it chargeable only as
trustee of a fund out of which plaintiff's claim was to be paid.
It was like a judgment, which in fact against an estate is nominally entered against the administrator thereof, to be satisfied
out of the property of the estate and not out of the individual
property of the administrator. The propriety of this judgment has not been questioned. No proceeding for review or
reversal has been instituted. It has been accepted by the complainant as a correct adjudication of the rights between the
parties; and in passing, it may be observed that its adjudication of rights was unquestionably correct. The scope of the
entire legislation, from its inception in 1858 to its close in
1872, was local improvements for the benefit of adjacent property, with payment only through special assessments; and did
not contemplate a work of general benefit, whose expense was
chargeable to the municipality at large. The legislation of
1858, 1859 and 1861, under which the work was commenced,
ignored the municipality entirely. It subdivided an area,
of which the city was a portion, into draining districts, and
cast upon a board of commissioners for each draining district
the responsibility of the work and the assessments. The
scheme was one of special assessments, as distinguished from
municipal tax for general benefits. The distinction between
the two is obvious 'and well recognized. It is stated by Cooley

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

in his work on Taxation, page 416: "The general levy of
taxes is understood to exact contributions in return for the
general benefits of government, and it promises nothing to the
persons taxed, beyond what may be anticipated from an administration of the laws for individual protection and the general public good. Special assessments, on the other hand, are
made upon the assumption that a portion of the community
is . to be specially and peculiarly . benefited, in the enhancement of the value of property peculiarly situated as regards a
contemplated expenditure of public funds; and, in addition to
the general levy, they demand that special contributions, in
consideration of special benefit, shall be made by the persons
receiving it. The justice of demanding the special contribution
is supposed to be evident in the fact that the persons who are
to make it, while they are made to bear the cost of public
work, are at the same time to suffer no pecuniary loss thereby;
their property being increased in value by the expenditure to
an amount at least equal to the sum they are required to pay.
This is the idea that underlies all these levies."
While the acts of 1871 and 1872 bring the municipal defendant into a scheme for subsequent duties, they do not bring it
in as a primary debtor, for whose benefit the work is to be
done, but simply as the agency by which the special assessments are to be collected; the trustee, as it were, of the special
assessments for the benefit of the contractor. So that while
the judgment at law measures the rights and obligations of
the parties to this bill in equity, if we were at liberty to look
beyond the judgment to the antecedent facts, we should be
compelled to hold that the judgment rightfully determined
those obligations; that the city never was chargeable with the
burden of primary indebtedness, but stood to the plaintiff only
as assessor and collector of the special.assessments. Properly
accepting this judgment at law as an adjudication of the measure of his-rights against the city, the complainant. charges the
defendant with three violations of duty out of which he claims
a recovery. He charges, in the first place, that the city did
not collect these'assessments when it ought to and could have
done so. Secondly, he says that as owner of- streets and pub-

Opinion of the Court.

lie grounds it was directly liable to the drainage fund for a
large amount, which it has not paid; and that, therefore, its
failure as collector to collect from itself as debtor to the fund,
authorizes a court of equity to proceed directly against it for
those unpaid assessients. And, thirdly, he says that by the
purchase under the authority of the act of 1876 the city assumed the duty of completing the contemplated work; that,
failing to do so, it became responsible for all injuries resulting
from such non-completion; and that, in consequence of such
non-completion, anticipated collections failed and special assessments became non-collectible, and the failure becomes a
proper ground of recovery against the city for any amount
which could have been, but was not, collected.
Before considering these matters, it should be premised that
to the extent that the city of New Orleans may be considered
a trustee, it is a compulsory, and not a voluntary and contractual trustee. The legislation of February 24, 1871, by
which, for the first time, it became connected with these local
improvements and assessments, gave it no option as to price or
party, but, prescribing and naming both, gave it simply discretion as to the places and extent of the work. It authorized
and empowered the canal company to dig the works and fixed
the price therefor. The obligations cast upon the city were
purely statutory, and while they were, in respect to the party
doing the work, and the collection of assessments, somewhat
in the nature of a trust, they are more to be regarded as statu'tory obligations, a failure to discharge which puts less strain
on the moral sense. Indeed, the statute connects rather the
officers of the city than the city itself'with the work. It is
true the 4ct provides that the title to the lands necessary for
the works shall be procured and held for the benefit of the
city of New Orleans; but it requires that such title shall be so
procured and held by the board of administrators of the city.
It also provides that the extent and nature of all improvements shall be designated by such board; and that such board
shall be required to build and run all workl and drainage
machines necessary to lift the water from the drainage canals
over into Lake Pontchartrain, and to do all other work neces-

sary to facilitate the work of the contractor selected and employed by the State. The administrator of accounts was
directed to draw the warrants on the administrator of finance
for the work done. All the assets and assessments accumulated and made under the prior statutes were transferred to
the board of administrators of th6 city. The prior assessments
were confirmed and made exigible at such time and in such
manner as the board of administrators might designate; and
such board was authorized to make an assessment of two mills
per superficial foot. So, that, while the title of the act is, "to,
provide for the drainage of .New Orleans," and while the city
comes into the statute as a party to be ultimately benefited,
and whose officers are charged with the administration, yet,
nowhere in its sections is the burden and duty of the work
cast upon the municipality as such. The paramount idea of
the statute seems to be not the casting of a duty upon the city,
to be discharged in such manner and by such means as it shall
select, but rather to transfer from the boards of the original
draining districts to certain officers and agents of the city the
duty of carrying into effect the drainage system.
We do not mean to be understood as affirming that no duty
or liability was cast upon the city by this statute as such, or
that the action of the city council thereafter and on April 27,
1871, was not within at least the implication of the statute.
All we mean to say is, that neither the full power nor the
general duty was cast upon the city, and that the designation
of its board of administrators as the agency to carry on the
work of drainage already undertaken by statutory direction.
by the local boards of separate districts placed upon the city
only a limited responsibility for that which such board might
do or omit to do.
The, significance of these observations is clear. There is
wide divergence in the authorities as to the circumstances
under which the liability of a city to a contractor for local
improvements arises in.case of the non-payment of the special
assessments. Into that field of inquiry we do not care to
enter. See 1 Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 4th ed., sections 481 and following, and notes.

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

If ever there was a case in which the responsibility of a city
should- be narrowed, this is one. By the legislation of the
State, it was denuded of all freedom of action. It had no
choice of contractor or price. Neither the-property to be
taxed, nor the means or method of collecting the assessments,
was intrusted to its discretion. This is not a case in which
there was a failure on the part of the legislative body, the city
council, to prescribe and provide' sufficient machinery for the
collection of assessments. No superintendence of the financial
department, whether as to the property to be assessed, the
amount of the assessment or the collection the-reof, was
intr'isted to the municipality. All this financial power was
placed directly, by state action, without its consent, in one of
its official boards. Thus denuded of freedom of action, it may
properly insist upon the narrowest limits of responsibility. If
the financial duty was devolved, without its consent, upon one
of its administrative boards, and such board was -derelict of
duty, it may properly say to a complaining party, your remedy
was mandamus, to compel prompt and efficient action by that
board. In respect to a kindred question, the neglect of the
city council, Judge Dillon pertinently asks, "why should all
be taxed for the failure of the council to do its duty in a case
where the contractor has a plain remedy, by mandamus, to.
compel the council to make the necessary assessment and proceed in the collection thereof with the requisite diligence?"
Section 482, 1 Dillon'on Municipal Corporations, 4th ed.
If that suggestion be pertinent where the dereliction is
that of the city council, the legislative assembly of a city, the
body charged primarily with the duty of making suitable provision for the discharge of all municipal obligations, how much
more is it true when such general legislative assembly is without power and charged -with no duty, and full responsibility
rests with a separate administrative board? The contractor is:
specially interested in the full and prompt discharge of its.
duty by this administrative board. The remedy of mandamus
is open-to him to compel its action. On what principle of
right and justice can he ignore this remedy and charge the
municipality and burden all the taxpayers of the city?
VOL.cxxxix-23

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

But supposing the dereliction of this board of administrators
was an omission on the part of the- city, what then, under the
facts of this case, would be the measure of liability? It will
be noticed that neither expressly nor by implication was there
any guaranty of payment, as appeared in the case of .femis
v. Brown, 20 Wall. 289. Whatever obligations were assumed
were only those of collection. The mere fact of non-collection
does not prove dereliction of duty. From 1858 to' 1871 this
drainage work, with the duty of assessment and collection,
was vested in certain local boards. The total assessments
during those years.amountod to $1,433,152.25. The amount
collected in cash and warrants was $334,941.62. In addition;
there was transferred to the commissioners, on non-payment
of assessments, lands of the nominal value of $11,239.11; or
a total collection of about half a million on a million and a
half of assessments. It stands to reason, and scarcely needs
the support of testimony, that during these many years the
available assessments were collected; and that what remained,
which was the large bulk, was charged upon property not
worth the assessment, and for that reason was not collectible.
The testimony of Mr. Guthrie, who was the representative of
the canal company and its assignee, is "that he would not
take the property bought in by the commissioners for nonpayment of assessments, and pay the taxes thereon." If they,
duting these many years, were unable to collect but a small
fraction of the assessments in cash, if -the property they took
was not worth the taxes, what can be said of the balance, or
the possibility of enforcing the collection of assessments.
thereon?
Further than that, we are not limited to mere matters of
inference. It appears afirmatively that the city provided an
office and officers for the collection of these taxes; and, according to the testimony given by the assignee of the canal company, the officer in charge was diligent in his efforts to collect
the tax. It appears, also, that the canal company had an
agent to look after this matter of collection of taxes, who
offered all reasonable inducements to secure their payment.
Again, the assignee of 'the canal company, pursuing the rem-

Opinion of the Court.

edy which was open to him, of mandamus to compel the seizure and sale, under proper writs, of the real estate subject to
these assessments for the payment of certain warrants, secured
an order of the court therefor. Fifteen hundred and seventyone writs were issued in obedience thereto, and the gross

proceeds of these writs was $32,466.6q.
supporting testimony of the agent of such assignee to induce
the belief that the most available property was that pursued
by these proceedings. Still further, the efforts to collect were
largely hindered by two decisions of the Supreme Court of
Louisiana. One, in the case of Te Sucee..vion (!f hrwin, 33
La. Ann. 63, by which practically the creati6n of the fourth
drainage district, and the assessments therein, were declared
null and void; and the other, in the case of Davidson v. The
City, 34 La. Ann. 170, in which it was ruled "that a judgmient
for a drainage tax will not be enforced when it is shown that
the property, far from being benefited, was injured by the
alleged drainage."
When to all these-is added the fact that large portions of
these draining districts were swamp and overflowed lands;
when one of the burdens of complaint here is, that the city,
by failing to complete this .work of drainage, had left the
lands in such condition as to be of practically no value; it is
obvious that if the duty of collection rested primarily and
absolutely on the city, it would be difficult to hold it derelict
of duty therein, and, renders very pertinent the language of
,the learned .Circuit Court which decided this case in the court
below, (38 Fed. Rep. 779,): "As td failure to collect, when
these assessments were handed over to the city to collect they
had been assessed 13 years, and for that period had been in
the hands of commissioners 'created expressly for the conduct
of the-drainage system, and with no other business. If such
bureaus had failed to collect for such a period, the inference is
strongly forced upon us that the assessments were substantially
uncollectible, especially by a municipal corporation, herself
crushed by debts. This is corroborated by the'outcome of the
mandamus proceedings taken by Van Norden, transferee of
the company, and as warrant-holder, to compel the citV to

issue writs of J'ierifaciam,against the owners in 1876.

To the

application for that writ the city answered that the cost of
the proceeding would equal, in her opinion, the amount realized. The result showed her estimate to be nearly correct;
for the cost of the 125 writs selected by the warrant-holders,
and therefore presumably the best for the purpose, was $34,000,
and the amount collected under them only $36,000."
The second contention is that the city was itself a debtor to
this drainage fund for nearly $700,000; that it had misappropriated a portion of the fund which it did receive; that as
trustee of these assessments it was its duty to collect from itself as debtor to such fund; and that having failed so to do it
can be properly charged in this proceeding. Cosiderable discussion took place on the argument, and is also found in the
briefs, as to whether streets and other public property can be
subjected to a lien for a share of the cost of local improvements, or whether the city stands in such relation to these
properties that it can be held liable as owner. It is unnecessary to enter into the merits of this discussion. It may be that
streets and other public grounds cannot be sold for non-payment of assessments for local improvements or other taxes,
and it may be that the city is not technically their owner, and
yet, at the same time, it may be true that the city, as representing the public, may, under proper proceedings, be chayged
as debtor for the proportion of the cost of local improvements,
which, by the rule established, would fall upon such public
property.
Neither do we need to examine the various decisions of the
Supreme Court of Louisiana, cited by counsel, or seek to determine what is the law of that State in respect to this matter.
For the purposes of this case we assume that the various assessment proceedings, taken in connection with the decision of the
Supreme Court approving the homologation of the tableaux,
operated, if not to cast a specific lien upon the streets and
other public grounds, at least to charge upon the city an obligation to the drainage fund for that share of the total cost of
the drainage determined by the proportion of the superficial
feet of streets 'and other public grounds to the entire area of

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of tihe Court.

the drainage districts. Upon that assumption the obligation
of the city to the drainage fund amounted to several hundred
thousand dollars. Assuming that to be true, the contention of
appellee is that it has paid into that fund far more than such
amount. It is admitted that the city has issued sixteen hundred thousand dollars of its own bonds, taking up thereby a
proportionate amount of the drainage warrants. It is not
questioned by complainant that if this issue of bonds is to be
taken as a payment of its iilebtedness to the drainage fund,
its obligations to that fund have been fully discharged, and, in
addition, that the amount of such contribution in excess of
its obligations to that fund more than covers all alleged misappropriation thereof. In other words, the sixteen hundred
thousand dollars exceeds both the obligations of the city to
the fund and its alleged misappropriation of any part thereof.
But the contention of complainant is that there is nothing in
the legislation, the ordinance, the warrants, the bonds, or other
proceedings, which expresses an intent to make this contribution one in discharge of such indebtedness; and that, if it
simply gave these bonds to the fund, if other and ultimate
corporate benefit was the consideration of their issue, it cannot
be affirmed that they were intended or ought to be taken as
payment of the original obligation created by the assessment
proceedings. The answer to this view is clear and just. It is
true that ordinance number 814, which provides for the refunding of warrants" into city bonds, contains no declaration
-that such refunding shall be in discharge of the city's obligation, as assessee, to the drainage fund; and that the assessment proceedings contain no receipt or release of the city as
assessee, by reason of its issue of bonds. On the face of the
record thefe is no discharge of the city's obligation as assessee;
and if we rest upon the letter, it perhaps could not be denied
that the .city is still a debtor to that fund; but equity looks
beyond the form to the substance of things, and these are substantial facts: For thirteen years a drainage system-had been
in force, in respect to which the city had no duty and no obligation other than as supposed owner and assessee of certain
public grounds. The assessment proceedings had proceeded

OCTOBER TER.M, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

so far that there was a large apparent obligation of the city
to the drainage fund. In 1871 an act of the legislature is
passed, empowering the canal company to complete the work,
transferring to a subordinate administrative body of the city
all assessments theretofore made, and imposing upon it the
further duty of assessment and collection. No provision is
made by the legislative act for payment for the work done or
to be done, otherwise than, through the collection of these
local assessments. In that emergency the city, by ordinance,
says to the contractor named by the State, go on with the
work, and if the warrants issued in payment therefor be not
satisfied out of the assessment collections at the end of the
year, they may be exchanged for city bonds. The work progresses, and warrants are issued and exchanged for city bonds,
which have passed into the markets of the world and remain
the undisputed obligations of the city, and to an amount far
in excess of all the assessments charged against the city. In
other words, the city, as assessee, owing the drainage fund a
certain debt, puts into that fund twice the amount of the debt.
Can any creditors of that fund thereafter equ'itably charge the
city as debtor to that fund, because when it put its moneys
into that fund it did not in express language §ay. I put these
in in discharge of my indebtedness? It will be borne in mind
that no new consideration passed from the contractor for this
cortribution of the city to the drainage fund. No legislative
act contemplated direct obligation on the part of the city.
Yrom first to last all meant local improvement, to be paid by
special assessments; and the contractor, all these years, had
only legislative authority to look to the special assessments for
payment. Its contract was entered into and performed, with
knowledge that the only legal right it had for payment consisted in these assessments. Without further consideration,
the city put into this fund these bonds, and they were accepted
by the contractor. It is doubtless true that the motive of the
city was to anticipate the collection of the assessments, and to
put into the hands of the contractor available assets to insure
speedy performance of the work, but the obligation of the
contractor was to do the work, and it gave no new obligation,

PEAKE v. NEW OIRLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

no new consideration, to the city or any other party, for these
bonds. To say after this contribution of the city to this fund,
a contribution without consideration except in discharge of its
debt to the fund, that because it was not expressed that the
contribution was to be taken as in discharge of the indebtedness, a court of equity will permit the contractor or its assignees to treat the contribution as a donation and charge the
contributor as a debtor, would be a mockery of justice and an
insult to equity. It must be borne in mind that a city is not
like a private individual, with absolute freedom of contract
and donation. It is simply the representative of the citizens
and taxpayers, a trustee for their interests; it has no general
powers of donation, and its contribution to a fund can never
be considered as a donation when there is an indebtedness to
that fund to be discharged. Indeed, if there were no indebtedness, the contribution, as a whole, might well be considered
as ultra vires, and, if by the issue of negotiable securities to
that fund an indefeasible obligation had been assumed bythe
city, it might in equity hold that fund as debtor to it for such
amount. Much stress is placed by counsel for appellant on
this point, and large reliance is placed on the fact that in these
bond transactions there was no declaration of. an intent to
appropriate them to the payment of the city's indebtedness, as
assessee, but, as we have indicated, such omission does not
militate against the rights created by the contribution. If the
city, as assessee, owed this fund seven hundred thousand dollars, it may rightfully answer to any demand of the contrac-'
tot, or its assignees, that it pay such amount into the fund, I
have already paid it, and it is no reply to that answer to say,
when you paid it you did not declare that you .paid it in discharge of that indebtedness. It is enough that the city paid
it, and paid it without other consideration than the discharge
of its indebtedness. We think this contention of the appel'
lant must also fail.'
The remaining proposition is, that under the authority of
the act of February 2-, 1876, the city purchased from the
canal company and its' transferee all rights, franchises and
privileges possessed, and all tools, machinery and apparatus

OCTOBER TERMhf, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

belonging to said company or its transferee; that having made
such purchase, it abandoned the work then incomplete; and
that the failure to complete the woric left large portions of the
re aty within the drainage districts of comparatively no value,
and thus rendered impossible the collection of the assessments.
One satisfactory answer to this is, that the testimony indicates
that if the work contemplated had been completed the property would have still remained, in its valueless condition of
swamp and overflowed lands, without other and furher work.
It would, to say the least, be ignoring the significance of a
large amount of testimony, to hold that, if the work as conteiplated had been finished, the lands would have been drained
and made valuable; but we do not base our decision upon the
results of :a completion, of the contemplated work; we rather
place-, it upon the other ground -that a municipality which
abandons a contemplatedand intended work of public improvements, assumes thereby no obligation to any parties who have
invested on the faith and expectatioh of benefit from. the completion of the work. When. a city or State contracts with an
individual or company for the doing of certain work, the right
remains to the contracting parties, at jny time, to abandon,
that work; no obligation arises to third parties, who become
interested in one way or another in the completion of the
work; there is no guaranty that the contracting parties may
not at any time abandon it; or abandoning it, that any contingent, further, "nd speculative liability will arise in favor of
such third parties. When the city bought out the contractor,
it did, not assume his debts. A municipality may, with tie
consent of its contractor, at any time abandon contracted
work.: Such abandonment does not make the city liable for the
debts of the contractor. So when the city purchases from
the contractor his property invested, and his rights existing in
the contract, such purchase creates no assumption of his debts.
Having purchased, it may abandon the work; and 'creditors
of the contractor cannot charge it as debtor on the theory that
if the work had been completed their claims would have become of value. Into every contract between a municipality
.11d an individual there enters, as between a.contract between

two private individuals, the right of determination at any time
by agreement of parties, and such abandonment creates, as to
third parties, no other or higher rights as against either the
contracting parties than existed at the time of the mutually
agreed upon abandonment. This contention, also, of complainant must fail.
We have given this case long consideration. The multitude
of facts presented, the large interests involved and the learned
and cogent arguments of counsel have compelled such con:
sideration. We appreciate fully the appeal made by the distinguished counsel for complainant in closing his argument
with this quotation from the opinion of three of the justices
of this court in lferriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, 520 :
"It is certainly of the highest importance to the people of
every State that it should make provision, not merely. for the
payment of its own indebtedness, but for the payment of the
indebtedness of its different municipalities. Hesitation to do
this is weakness; refusal to do it is dishonor. Infidelity to
engagements causes loss of character to the individual; it
entails reproach upon the State." And we trust that this
court will never falter in its duty of brushing away all false
pretences, and holding every municipality obedie'nt to the
spirit as well as the letter of all its contract obligations. At
the same time it is equally the duty of this court, as of all
others, to see to it that no burden is cast upon taxpayers, citizens of a municipality, which does not spring from that which
is justly and equitably a debt of the municipality; and, when
a contract for local improvements is entered into, the contractor
must look to the special assessments, and to them alone, for
his compensation, and if they fail, without dereliction or wrong
on the part of the city, neither justice nor equity will tolerate
that it be charged as debtor therefor.
The decree will be

I will state as briefly as possible the view we take of the three
controlling questions involved-: Whether the city became,
debtor to the drainage fund for the assessments on the streets
and other public places; whether it is liable as trustee for the
individual assessments uncollected; and whether its debt and
liability, if any, has been discharged either directly by payment or indirectly by an equitable set-off.
Did the city of New Orleans become debtor to the drainage
fund for the assessments upon the streets, squares and other
public areas? Counsel for the- appellee contend that it did
not; and in support of that position rely upon several proposi"
tions, the first of which 'only demands notice.
It is contended that as the city of New Orleans and the
parish of Jefferson were not by the acts of 1858, .1859 and
1861 expressly declared liable, or giireh anything to do with
the execution of the works in question - which works-were of
the kind usually constructed at the expense of the individuals
benefited - the legislature did not intend that the city and
parish should be numbered among the contributors, and that
as a general rule such assessments are not construed to include
public property.
The questions raised on this proposition involve the powers,
capacities and liabilities of the city of New Orleans, a municipal corporation of the State of Louisiana, and consequently a
part of its governmental machinery; a fact to be kept steadily
in view when questions of the legislative power are being examined. And furthermore, the conclusions of the Supreme
Court of Louisiana on those questions, even if they are different from the usual holdings (and we do not mean to imply
that they" are) should hat-e great, if not controlling, weight
with this court. It seems to us that this point has been settled
by tha.t tribunal. The case at bar does not present the first
instance in the history of New Orleans of the experiment of
drainage based on area taxation. In.the year 1835 a company
was incorporated for that purpose, in which the city was a
stockholder. The company taxed every foot of land, including streets; etc: Litigation ensued. The point of liability was
directly raised and distinctly decided. The Supreme Court

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J., Fuller, 'C. JI., Lamar, J.

sustained the tax on the streets and said: "The large proportion of the expense by which this burden is thrown upon the
city for these streets meets, in some measure, that equity which
has been urged upon our consideration, that as the work has
been undertaken for the public good, the public ought to bear
the charge of it, notwithstanding the benefit to the owner of
the'soil." Draining Company,petitioner, 11 La. Ann. 338, 343.
Indeed, what could be more just than that a local assessment, directly beneficial to all, should, in some form and to
some extent, at least, be provided for by a general contribution? Why should the cost of it be defrayed by one species
of property alone? And how obtain that contribution more
simply than by an assessment on the public property, although
such assessment may not be enforceable by a sale, and must be
otherwise provided for?
The decision above quoted was made in the year 1856. Two
years later the first of the statutes now under consideration,
thai of 1858, was passed. It is hardly conceivable that the
legislature which passed that act were ignorant of the decision
of 1856, or of the construction placed upon the statute of 1835.
Or that, knowing it, they still intended to produce a different
result in the act of- 1858, not by adopting different but by
reproducing almost the identical terms. The latter statute is
substantially, indeed almost literally, a reproduction of the
former; and that former statute had just been construed by
the Supreme Court.
In the case of Mlarquez v. New Orleans, 13 La. Ann. 319,
the court held that the city as the owner of the middle ground,
or public promenade, running along the centre of Claiborne
Street, was liable for one-half of the cost of improving that
street, and in .the case of cross streets, was liable for the
whole cost, since as to these parts there were no abutting
owners. The city was treated, and the case decided, exactly
as if it were an individual proprietor.
So also in the cases of Correjolles v. Succession of Fanchor,
26 La. Ann. 362, and of Barber Paving Co. v. Gogreve, 41
La. Ann. 251, a question arose. in respect to the ownership by
the city of the public places, and the same conclusion was

361,.

reached. How these cases may be reconciled with that of
Xiques v. Bjao,7 La. Ann. 498, 503, cited by the counsel for
appellee to the point that public places are not held in fee, and
that the terml "title" is not applicable to them, or whether
they overrule it and all similar questions, are imnaterial inquiries. The court, in the four cases cited, held the city to be
a proprietor, in the contemplation of the laws providing 'for
local assessments, and in the absence of any express statutory
direction on that point; and such is the exact question here.
We therefore consider that question settled; especially when
considered in connection with the fact that these assessments
have been reduced to judgments and confirmed by courts of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of which -s well as the
regularity of the assessments has been recognized and approved by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. State of Touisiana ex rel. -Fan Nordem v. iJayor &cc. of ffew Orleans, 27
La. Ann. 497.
We now advert to the claim of the appellant that the city
is liable, for the drainage, fund, as delinquenit trustee., Tliat
liability is asserted, on three distinct grounds: 1st, because the
city unjustifiably failed to collect the .assessincnt due the
fund; 2d, because it failed, as subrogee of the original contractor, to continue the work of drainage, and thus secure, under
the decisions of the Louisiana courts, the collectibility of the
assessments; 3d, because she has paid out moneys belonging
to the fund for purposies not permitted by the law. A short
outline of some of the history of these matters will be proper.
The act of 1858 established the first, second and third drainage-districts; organized a district lboard in each, with full control of the drainage in .thatidistrict; gave the board the power
to levy a uniform assessment per square foot on the land to be
draixied, not to exceed $350,000 in the aggregate, in each district; made the assessments first liens on the lands assessed;
provided, in case of non-payment, that judgment therefor
should be recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction;
that lands be sold for arrearages, costs and interest; and that
the respective boards mightpurchase the, same, and hold or
dispose of them for the benefit of the districts.

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J., Fuller, C. J., Lamar, J.

The act of 1859 authorized the boards to borrow $350,000
for each district and to issue bonds therefor; and directed the
boards, on issuing bonds, to make assessments in conformity to
the act of 1858, to be collected in not less than ten annual
instalments, and to be applied exclusively to the payment
or purchase of such bonds, and the payment of the interest'
thereon.
The act of 1861 provided that copies of the assessments
made as above should be filed in certain designated courts,
and, after notice, approved and homologated, and that they
should then constitute judgments against the property assessed
and the owners thereof, on which executionis might issue as on
judgments rendered in the ordinary mode, and that ten per
cent be added to pay counsel fees and costs.
Under these statutes the boards organized, made the assessments, ciused some of them to be homologated, collected a
portion of the money and did some. of the work. Until 1869
they continued to exist and to be more or less active in discharging their duties. The system, however, did not prove
satisfactory by reason of the absence of responsibility and of
unity of action on the part of the several boards. The act of
1869, therefore, consolidated the districts, abolished the boards,
and appointed a commissioner, who was to succeed to their
property, collect the assessments and levy and collect others
on such parts of the district as were not included in the tableaux turned over to him. The commissioner, however, was
not to do the work. That was to be done by a company, which
was to receive all the collections in return for certain work.
By the act of 1871 an entirely new scheme was devised.
The Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal Company was
authorized to do the work needed; the city board of administrators was empowered to locate the canals and levees, and
required to build and run the machines necessary to lift the
water over from the canals into the lake; the city surveyor to
furnish the company monthly estimates of the work done, on
which warrants were to be issued by the city auditor; the city
treasurer to pay those warrants.f rom any funds in the treasury
to the credit of the company; and, if there was not the money

necessary, to endorse the date 'of presentation, the warrant to
bear interest therefrom. To provide tbe necessary funds, all
the assets and the assessments provided for by the acts of 1858,
and the various acts supplementar'y thereto, were transferred
to the city,, and the city was subrogated to all the rights,
powers and faculties thereby conferred. The city was expressly required to collect the assessments, (which were, at the
same time made exigible and confirmed,) in time to provide
for the payment of the warrants. It was authorized to assess
those lands in the three original districts, and such iothers
included in the levees, as had not been already assessed; the
assessments to bp enforced as in, the prior acts. All moneys
collected were to be passed: to the credit, of the company, for
the payment only of the drainage of New Orleans and Carrollton; and all property, not money, received, to be held in trust,

These large assets, having come to the hands of the city for
the purposes of a great public trust, it was bound to relieve
itself of the charge assumed by it in some way consistent with
the rule of reasonable diligence. In view of its antecedent
agency, and its coiperative action in the creation of the trust
and its more than willing acceptance of it, added to the fact
that it was the party to be ultimately benefited, we are not
prepared to accept the .theory that it was a compulsory and
not a voluntary or contractual trustee, a failure to discharge
whose obligations puts less strain upon the moral sense than
if the obligations had been purely statutory. And in this
connection, it is well to observe that this bill was filed for the
purpose of an accounting. A trustee, city or not- it is immaterial- receives large assets, of which its own liability
forms a considerable part; and the simple question is, how
shall it relieve itself of the charge? How does the city do
so in this case? Not by collection and disbursement according to the law and her duty, for it is conceded that about
$1,400,000 was never collected. But(1) By a claim that the assessments were greater than the
value of the lands, and, therefore, that they could not be collected from the lands. To this proposition there are several
answers: First, as well argued by counsel for the appellee, it
cannot be generally true in fact, since the lands are those on
which the great city of New Orleans is built, and the assessments ranged from $69 to $140 per acre; second, in those
instances in which the assessment was greater than the vahle
of the lands, if there were any such, then the statute made
provision by which the lands themselves, on failure of the
owners to pay, should be sold and bought in by the city for
the fund, and the duty of the city was to do this -in fact, it
was done by the original board of the 15th district in the case
of the asylum property; third, the statutes also provided, as
has been seen, that personal executions should be issued
against the owners for arrearages, damages and costs, and there
is no showing, in our opinion, of anything like reasonable diligence in the use of this valuable right-a right which the
Supreme Court of the State, in 1874, recognized and adjudged.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J., Fuller, C. J., Lamar, J.

We are impressed with the conviction that, although under
the act of 1871, it was the duty of the city to press the collection of these funds at the rate of about $25,000 per month,
yet it did nothing more than keep an office open at which the
assessees might voluntarily pay, or not pay, as they wished.
(2) By a claim that the decision of the Supreme Court in the
Succe8sion of Irwin, 33 La. Ann. 63, held that certain personal
judgments obtained by the summary processes given by the
act of 1871 were void, and nullified the homologation of the
tableaux for the entire fourth. district. This decision was not
rendered until the year 1881, the city then having had charge
of this matter for ten years. The decision cannot, of course,
be successfully offered as an apology for the antecedent supineness of so long a period. Prior to that, the Louisiana courts
had been enforcing the statute of 1871, as we have already
shown. And, further, in regard to the Irwin case, if it was of
such, grave import as to effectually prevent the collection of
these moneys, then it was probably violative of contract rights,
and on proper proceedings could have been avoided. If it was
not of such import, then it is no answer to the obligation of
the city to make the collections aforesaid. In fact, the testimony in this case would indicate that the city was deliberately
obstructing, not forwarding, the collection of these funds.
In December, 1873, after having failed to collect the taxes
to pay the warrants when due, the city adopted an ordinance
allowing the taxes to be paid, in warrants, thus compelling the
contractor to sell at a discount or get no money at all. After
collecting only $88,000 in three and a half years, with warrants falling due at the rate of $25,000 a month, and making
no effort to collect except to keep an office, and never having
issued an execution up to January, 1875, the city then denie?
the right of the warrant holders to have execution, and resisted
the mandamus that resulted in the judgment of the Supreme
Court sustaining such right. The city did not make any effort,
worthy of mention, to collect the tax from the owners independent of the land. After the purchase of the plant from
the contractor in 1876, under the statute passed to that end,
and the subrogation of the city to all the right of such con-

tractor, it deliberately abandoned the work, let the canals
already dug fill up and the boats and other appliances, for
which about $300,000 of warrants were issued, rot unused. By
reason of that abandonment and the consequent non-completion of the system the Supreme Court of Louisiana decided, in
the case of Davidson v. T/te City qf Yew Orleans, 3-4 La. Ann.
170, that the tax could not be enforced. In 1881, pending the
decision of the Davidson case, the mayor, by direction of the
council, issued a proclamation advising the non-payment of
drainage taxes until the validity thereof should be passed on
by the Supreme Court, notwithstanding the previous judicial
history of these transactions. In 1883 the council appointed
a committee to investigate and report whether any drainage
taxes were being collected and by what authority, and published in their proceedings the report whereby it was declared
the large amount of taxes due and outstanding were not collectible, and in which was set forth the method by which the
assignees might get relieved from the assessments.
Such are substantially the charges made by the appellant to
show that the city, after seeking and accepting the trust, was
opposing its execution, instead of enforcing it.
(3) By a claim that the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Davidson v. Hrew O2leans, 32 La. Ann. 245, to the
effect that a judgme.nt for a drainage tax will not be enforced
where it is shown that the property received no benefit from
the drainage, was a great hindrance, as its effect was to release
from their liability for the assessment more than half of the
first and third drainage districts and almost the whole of the
second. The ground of the decision was the abandonment bthe city of the work it was charged to do. It is manifest that
the city cannot relieve itself of the obligation to collect the
assessments avoided by its own default. To meet this proposition the appellee contends that the cost of completion would
have been so great that the assessments would have been more
than exhausted in completing the work, and the outstanding

be considered money in hand. The appellee states the amount
necessary to have completed the system, as projected, "at
nearly or quite $700,000." The dues .of the city alone would
have- completed the work according to'appellant's own statement and have left a balance for the benefit of warrant holders
of about $725,000..
But the appellee also claims.that when completed there
would still have been lands in the district unbenefited, on
which the total assessments would have amounted to $500,000,
and that these assessments, according to the Davidson case,
would not have been collectible. If all that were correct and
if the city had no other resources for finishing of work than
these assessments, still a margin of about $225,000 would have
been left for the benefit of warrant holders. On the other
hand, however, we cannot yield assent to the Davidson decis-ion. We cannot and do not accept the proposition that where
the legislature passes on the necessity of a great public work
like this, and organizes a district for its prosecution, the assessments made are void unless the property assessed is directly
and evidently benefited. What question of that kind may exist, is a question of the district,not of the individual properties.
The Davidson decision would wreck every work of a like character we ever knew. The entire levee systems of the Mfississippi River would be swept away at once, for the taxes would
be void as to all lands above overflow from the river unleveed,
and as to all those which lie so low as to remain wet and
untillable in the absence of a supplemental system of drainage,
even after the completion of the levees. Admit the principle that
these general assessments or,taxes are to be brought to the testof particular benefits, and the most unexpected and disastrous
consequences would follow., Moreover, our criticism on the
Irwin case, as to its violation of contract rights already fixed,
applies to the Davidson case, if possible, with even greater, force.

The next point calling for our consideration is the proposition of appellee that the liability, if it existed, has been discharged, either directly by payment, or indirectly by an
equitable set-off. It was upon this ground the Circuit Court
proceeded, and upon this ground the opinion of the majority
rests. This claim is based upon the fact that, proceeding
under act No. 73 of 1872, the city retired about $1,600,000 of
drainage warrants by issuing for them its own seven per cent
fifty-year gold bonds. The claim resolves itself into two
heads, one of payment and one of set-off. But in order to
consider either it will be necessary to advert again to the history of those bonds. The act of 1858, inaugurating the drainage enterprise, provided, as we have seen, for the expenses by
an assessment on lands to be a lien on them reducible to judgment. The act of 1859 authorized the issue of the bonds by
the commissioners of each district,- not to exceed $350,000 in
each district, to the payment and purchase of which, and the
payment of interest thereon, the assessments were exclusively
devoted. Then followed the act of 1861, which made the
assessments personal liabilities, on which,. when reduced to
judgment, common executions might. issue. Then the act of
1869 abolished the several boards of commissioners, in order to
get rid of the obstruction arising from want of harmony among
them, appointed a commissioner for the entire territory, and
ordered the construction of the drainage canals to be paid
from the assessments so collected. Then came the act of 1871.
It provides for certain canals and levees to be dug and constructed by the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal Company; for the supervision of the work, and the administration
of the funds by the city; and for the application of the assessments when collected only to drainage. Here first appears
the direction to draw warrants on account of work done; and
it is directed that if warrants were not paid, on presentation,
they should draw eight per cent interest. Provision was
made for assessments in addition to those already levied.
During all this there was evidently felt the pressure of, the
actual 'fact that the assessments were not collected with
sufficient regularity and promptness to meet the urent do-

mands of a scheme so 6xtensive, as Well as of the want of a

more acceptable security to contractors for the large expenditures entailed. Therefore, two months after the passage of
'the act bf 1871, the city ordinance provided that, "in case the
Warrants issued for drainage works to be done by the Mississippi and M exican Gulf Ship Company should not be paid
within one year out of the proceeds of the drainage taxes and
assessments, they should be fundablel in bonds of the city,
bearing'eight per cent interest, payable semi-annually, having
ten years'to run, and with 'due provision for retiring the same,
ant securing the punctual payment 'of interest and gradual
extinction of principal."
Then followed act Noo:73 of 1872. This is the statute under
which the bonds in 'fact issued, and an analysis of which is
indispensable here. Its objects, as expressed in its title, were,
" To authorize the, council of the city of N'ew Orleans to levy
a police tax; to regulate the levies of taxes, the proceedings
of ta# suits, and the jurisdiction of the District Courts for the
plhrish of Orleans in reference thereto; to define and punish
forgery in certain cases; to authorize the funding of the floating debt; to consolidate, limit and provide for the debt'of the
city of New Orleans, principal and interest; to authorize a tax
for the support of the city govel-nment, and to establish a fiscl agency, defining its duties, and for the better enforcement
of the collection of all'taxes."
Section 13 of the act runs thus:
"S&b. 13. Be it fuwther enacted, etc.' That for unbonded
delts existing December 31, 1871, and unpaid at the time of
the passage of this act, or caused by receipts of certificates of
1871; for revenues propei of 1872, and for excavations' 'and
levees, drainage machinery and revetments authorized by law
or required for the ' protection of the city from overflow and
inundation the city may issue from time to time, a8 they may
be required, bonds of the denominations of five hundred and
one thousand'dollars, having fifty 'years to run, and bearing
seven per cent interest, ifrincipal and interest payable' in gold
in New York or'New Orleans, and at any other points that
the council may designate, with quarterly coupons, and that

the bonds thus issued shall be called the new consolidated debt
of New Orleans. No bonds shall be issued but by authority
of the council, nor for a lower rate than ninety cents on the
dollar; all issued for excavations and levees, authorized by act
No. 30 of 1871, or by drainage laws previously enacted, shall
be marked "Drainage Series," and all taxes collected for
drainage, and not required for the payment of drainage warrants, shall be devoted to the purchase from the lowest bidder
of bonds issued for drainage; no bid to be accepted above par,
and the right reserved to the council to reject all unsatisfactory bids."
Proceeding under this statute, the city issued about $1,600,000 of the drainage bonds, taking up therewith warrants
issued for work done. It is claimed that in issuing those
bonds the city thereby paid of both its own assessed dues to
the drainage fund, as well as discharged any liability it may
have been under on account of its non-feasance or mis-feasance
as statutory trustee of the fund. We cannot accept that
view.
It seems to us clear that it was not the intention of the legislature that such should be the effect of the issue of those
bonds. That intention must of course control, as it is a question of the power of the municipality to issue negotiable
bonds. The section authorized a series of bonds to be issued,
and directed "that the bonds thus issued shall be called the
new consolidated debt of New Orleans." They were to constitute one debt, the consolidated debt, not a variety of
debts, nor even two distinct debts; and the statute manifestly
proceeded on the idea that this one consolidated debt is to
be paid, as all city debts are paid, out of the property of the
city, and that without any express declaration to that effect.
United ,tates v. lVew Orleans,98 U. S. 381. The purposes for
which the bonds were to be issued were: (1) for unbonded

overflow, or inundation;" one as well as the other, one no less
than the other.
Now,, certain of those bonds were to be marked," Drainage
Bonds.' What bonds, and why?, The statute in words answers: "All issued for the excavations and levees authorized
by act No. 30 of 181i, or by drainage laws previously enacted." No bonds could be lawfully so marked, except such
as were issued ". for, excavations and levees;" not for drainage
macbinery pr revetments; not even for excavations and levees
to be thereafter made, unless they were such as the statutes
named authorized; not for excavations and levees previously
made, since ,they were already settled for by warrants, whatever such warrants might be worth; still less for the debts or
liabilities of the city, however they may have been incurred.
The city could not properly thus mark any bonds issued for
any purposes except those expressly limited in the statute those issued in payment for excavations and levees authorized
to be made by the act of 1871, and the preceding acts. And
why? For a reason entirely in harmony with the whole tendency of the entire series of statutes, and with the requirements of good faith to the contractors working under those
statutes; for the purpose of expediting the workand of giving increased value to those particular bonds.
The appellee contends that these bonds have only the force
of warrants, and could only be paid, out of the proceeds of the
assessments already made, notwithstanding they had fifty
years to run before payment could be demanded at all. Not
so; they were privileged bonds in the series. And, beside
the general liability of the city, the statute provided that all
the proceeds of assessments not needed, to pay off warrants, if
any, coming in, (and in doing which the issue of that class was,
pro tanto, prevented and rendered unnecessary,) should be an
additional special fund with which the city should purchase
said bonds before maturity at a price agreed on not exceeding
par, thereby giving the bondholders, or some of them, if there
were, any such excess of receipts, an option to get their money
before maturity. Whether a sound one or not, such was
clearly the scheme, and it presupposed the continued existence

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J., Fuller, C. J., Lamar, J.

and the continued collection of the assessments after the issue
of the bonds; and plainly excludes the idea that such issue is
to extinguish the assessments, or any of them. Not an intimation is given of any difference between one class of assessments and another; those of the city and those of individuals.
Therefore, the city had no power to issue such bonds for the
purpose of paying the assessments. It had, perhaps, the
power to issue bonds of the unmarked sort for that purpose, if
Van Norden, the transferee of the company's rights, had "consented to receive them for that purpose; but it was not
claimed that this was done or tried. The question is, as to
the effect of the issuing of the marked bonds.

Moreover, in issuing these bonds the city had no intention
to pay its assessments thereby; nor were they received with
any such intention or understanding by the receiver of them.
This is amply shown by the following facts:
(1) It was the regular custom to mark on the assessient
rolls all the payments made. No such entry was made in this
case.
(2) The issue of bonds, after they were authorized, was
always and largely in excess of the homologated judgments
against the city on its assessments.
(3) Judgments were being constantly rendered against the
city on her assessments, after she had issued bonds far ahead
of even her claimed liability, yet she never presented any
claim for payment.
(4) The city administrator of public accounts in his report
to the city council, July 1, 1872, said that the city had already
issued certificates for $485,081 of the new consolidated
bonds, drainage series; and he states the amount due by the
city for the streets to be $763,378.69, the total amount originally assessed against the city. On the theory of payment it
would have been only $258,297.69. To constitute payment,
money or some other valuable thing must be delivered by the
debtor to the creditor for the purpose of extinguishing the
debt, and the creditor must receive it for the same purpose.

'737; Wooel v. Guarantee T'ust Co., 128 U. S. 416; QueaA v.
Ashwell, 16 Q. B. D. 190, 22-1. These views are reinforced, if
they' need reinforcement, by the fact that the real question of
payment or no payment lies between the city in its ordinary
municipal capacity on the one hand and the city in its extraordinary capacity as statutory trustee on the other.' Payment is a contract implying both proposal and acceptance;
and under- such conditions could the city have made such a
contract without a clear statutory authority? 'We think not.
If the legislature had designed to authorize the city to extinguish its own liability in this manner, it would'have said so.'
The remaining point to be noticed is that of the equitable
set-off. The argument of the appellee on this line is as follows: The act of 1872 was only an enabling act to terminate
the power of the municipality to issue bonds of the same tenor
as the warrants which were takren up; that is to say, payable
out of the drainage fund if' that should suffice. The case, as
here reg arded then, is clearly that of a trustee, who has,'by
error, issued securities for the advantage of the cestui quo trust.
Having so issued the securities, it must result, inevitably, that
the city is to be credited with the amount to the extent of
which she has relieved the fund.
It is obvious that the entire force of' this argument rests on
the proposition that the drainage bonds were to be .issued,
payable only out of the drainage fund, and did not import, as
contemplated by the statute, any direct liability on the city;
also, that there was no error in the act of issuing the bonds.
We have already, in the preceding passage, analyzed the statute, and shown that according to our view, a direct liability
on the city was exactly what was intended, the provision as
to the drainage fund in connection with those bonds being
merely a cumulative provision for them. That view, of course,
disposes of this argument, since it denies the major premise.
Outside of the statute we will mention one or two facts
confirmatory of the view that it was not the intention to have
the drainage bonds paid from the assessments. First,' assessments in 1872 were less by or about $200,000 than the known
sum needed to complete the system devised by the act of

PEAKE v. NEW ORLEANS.

Opinion of the Court.

1871 ; secondly, although the assessments were collected while
the bonds were issued, so slowly and meagrely, as we have
seen, that fact, overwhelming if they were to constitute the
only resource for payment, seemed not to have the slightest
effect on either the city or the contractor in this matter; and,
finally, the fact, that the bonds were made payable fifty years
after date seems of itself a sufficient contradiction of the idea
that the only source for payment at that late date was these
assessments.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the court below erred
in dismissing the bill. We think an account should have been
stated on the basis indicated herein in its general outlines.
The city was trustee by statute, and can be called to account
by any person in interest. Exactly h6w the decree, when
rendered, and the ascertainment of liability thereby made
should have been enforced, it is hardly worth while to discuss
in a dissenting opinion. The usual remedy is by mandamus
where a public body cannot be subjected to ordinary process.
That is a matter of detail only. The fact that the public
property could not be sold on execution is no reason for
absolving the city altogether from liability. The city should
at least have paid what it -itself owed on the assessments in
question.
Upon these grounds we feel constrained to withhold our
assent from the opinion and judgment of the court.
