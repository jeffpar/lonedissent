v. HAM-ILL.

Opinion of the Court.

.r. George TF. Van Slyck for Elizabeth A. L. Hyatt, opposing.
PER Cu1Aim.

This is an application for a writ of error

made to the court in session, under the apprehension on the
part of counsel that it was directed to be so presented. We
have, therefore, considered it, with the result that the writ
must be denied. Dae Tile .Zfg,Co. v. -Hyatt,125 U. S. 46;
Walter A. TWood Co. v. Skinner, ante, 293.
We wish it to be distinctly understood that in future no
such application will be entertained, except when a Justice
of this Court, upon consideration of the record, has deemed
it proper under special circumstances to endorse thereon a
request that counsel be permitted to proceed in that way.
Writ refused.

Opinion of the Court.

matter of this suit, and in certain letters patent, in respect to
which the bill herein was filed by McClosky against Hamill.
A decree dismissing the bill was entered in the Circuit Court
on April 21, 1883. Judgment for costs was rendered June 16,
1883. The record does not show the judgment of June 16,
but the petition for appeal states that "on the 21st day of
April, 1883, a decree was made in said suit and duly entered,
whereby it was ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said
bill of complaint be dismissed, and that the said McClosky pay
to the above-named respondent .the costs of said suit, to be
taxed, and thereupon the said costs were taxed; and on the
16th day of June, 1883, the final decree was entered in said
cause, including judgment for the amount of said costs as
taxed, and execution was duly issued for said costs, etc."
The application for the allowance of an appeal. was dated
June 15, and the appeal allowed June 16, 1885. The citation
was signed June 16 and the appeal bond executed June 1I,
1885. The petition for and allowance of appeal and the citation were filed in the Circuit Court June 19, and the appeal
bond June I, 1885.
The final decree was that of April 21, 1883, and the appeal
was not taken in time. Rev. Stat. ยง 1008; Sitsby v. Foote, 20
How. 290. And had the judgment for costs of June 16, 1883,
been the final decree, still the result must be the same, as the
papers on appeal were not filed in the Circuit Court within two
years thereafter. Credit Co. v. Arkansa Cent. Railway Co.,
128 U. S. 258. The appeal must therefore be
Dismissed..
