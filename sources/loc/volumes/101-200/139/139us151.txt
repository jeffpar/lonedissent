TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR THE

DISTRICT OF KANSAS.

No. 1072. Submitted January 12,1891.-Decided March 2,1891.
In Kansas, if the description in a deed of land sold for non-payment of
taxes departs from the description contained in the assessment roll and
the prior tax proceedings, such prior description, if imperfect and insufficient, avoids the deed, although the description in the latter may be
sufflciexit and complete.

JUSTICE

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action of ejectment to recover the possession of
seven lots in Kansas City, Kansas. Defendant rested his
.defence on tax deeds for the several lots, and the single question is as to the validity of those tax deeds. A jury being
waived, the case was tried by the court; and findings of fact
were made, froi which the court, as a conclusion of law, held

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

that the tax deeds were invalid by reason of a misdescription
of the lots in the tax proceedings. Our inquiry is limited to
the question whether, upon the findings, the conclusion was
correct.
From these findings it appears that the present value of the
lots is in excess of five thousand dollars. This suit was commenced prior to February 12, 1884. It further appears that
in. 1878 sale was made for the taxes of 187V; that thereafter
the purchaser paid the taxes of 1878, 1879 and 1880; and
that his total investment for these taxes was $104.80. The
statutes of Kansas in force at the time of these proceedings
gave to an-investor in taxes twenty-four per cent interest. It
certainly is a large demand on an investment of $10-.80 to
insist upon title to property worth more than five thousand
dollars; and when by the laws of the State there is given
a fixed and prior lien for the investment, and interest thereon
at twenty-four per cent, it is impossible not to observe that
the large interest ought to satisfy any reasonable person. IBut
the purchaser rests on the letter of his bond, and he has a
legal right so to do; but under such circumstances he must
rest alone on its letter. He has no overpowering equity to
justify a large and liberal interpretation of statutory proceedings. Surrounding circumstances may sometimes sustain an
imperfect description in a voluntary deed by a grantor, but
seldom one made in hostile tax proceedings. In Tallman v.
White, 2 Comstock (2 N. Y.) 66, it was said that "an assessment for taxes of non-resident land is fatally defective if it
contains such a falsity in the description of the parcel assessed
as might probably mislead the owner, and prevent him from
ascertaining by the published notices that his land was to be
sold or redeemed. Such a mistake or falsity defeats one of
the obvious and just purposes of the statute-that of giving
to the owner an opportunity of preventing the sale by paying
the tax." In "Hill v. .2owry, 6 Gray, 551, the rule is laid
down that a tax deed, "taking effect only as the execution of
a statute power, should be construed with some strictness, so
as to enable the grantee to identify the land, and to enable
the owner to redeem it;" and it was held that a deed which

STOUT v.

Opinion of the Court.

bounded the land correctly on two sides, on the third by land
on which it was in fact bounded only in part, and on the
fourth by land from which it was separated by the land of
another person, was void for uncertainty. Now the description in one of these tax deeds, and so far as the question here
is concerned they are all alike, is "lot 246 Armstrong Street,
Kansas City, Kansas, situated in the county of Wyandotte
and State of Kansas." There was a lot in that city answering
to this description; but such description does not conform to
that found in the assessment roll and prior tax proceedings;
and it was adjudged by the Supreme Court of Kansas, in the
case of Hewitt v. Storchl, 31 Kansas, 488, that in making a tax
deed the county clerk has no power to go beyond the description in the prior tax proceeding; and if he adds anything
thereto, such addition does not aid or materially benefit the
deed. In other words, the description in a tax deed does not
end the question. If it is a departure from that contained in
the assessment roll and prior tax proceedings, such prior
description, if imperfect and insufficient, avoids the deed,
although the description in the latter may be sufficient and
complete.
In that case the description in the assessment roll and prior
tax proceedings was of a lot in Challiss's addition; that in the
deed was of a lot of the same number in L. C. Challiss's addition. Plats of two additions to the city of Atchison had been
filed - one named "Challiss's addition" and the other "L. C.
Challiss's addition." There was an error in recording the first
plat, which was attempted to be corrected by the second, which
also included territory other than that described in the first;
and the latter plat, with its description, became the recognized
plat of the entire addition. So, to perfect the description, which
in the assessment roll was Challiss's addition, in the tax deed
the clerk described the lot as in L. C. Challiss's addition. In
respect to this departure, that court observed in an opinion by
Chief Justice Horton: "It is unnecessary for the purpose of
this case to decide whether the tax-toll, of 1872, or the tax certificate of May 15, 1873, sufficiently described lot 19, in block
16, in L. C. Challiss's addition to the city of Atchison. A tax

deed to be valid must not only substantially conform to the
requirements of the statute, but must correspond with the proceedings upon which it is based in all essential particulars. The
county treasurer must give to the purchaser, on the payment
of his bid, a certificate describing the lands purchased in accordance with the records of the tax proceedings in his office. If
the land be not redeemed within the time prescribed by the
statute, the county clerk of the county where the land is sold,
on presentation to him of the certificate of sale, must execute
in the name of the county, as county clerk, to the purchaser,
his heirs or assigns, a deed to the land remaining unredeemed;
but he has no power to insert in the deed executed by him
another and different description from that contained in the
tax proceedings. While it is sufficient to describe lands in all
proceedings relative to assessing, advertising or selling the
same for taxes, by initial letters, abbreviations and figures to
designate the township, range, section or parts of section, and
also the number of lots and blocks, and 'while it is competent
for the county clerk, instead of using such initial letters, abbreviations and figures in tax deeds executed by him, to write out
in full the words which such initial letters, abbreviations, etc.,
represent, yet he is not to make any material or suUstantial
variance in the description of the property inserted in the deed
from that set forth in the prior tax proceedings upon which it
is based. Each act of the tax proceedings must substantially
correspond with its immediate antecedent. Blackwell on Tax
Titles, 434."
That case is decisive of this. For while the tax deed describes lot 246, Armstrong Street, the assessment roll describes
the property as lot 246, Armstrong block.- It is true the ninth
finding of fact shows that "upon the plat of Kansas City,
Kansas, and in conveyances of land and in tax-sale proceedings
in the old city of Kansas City, Kansas, the lots are numbered
by streets and. not by the block, and ' Ewing,' ' Joy,' ' James,'
'Wood' and 'Armstrong' are names of streets in said city;"
and the eighth finding also shows, that "on the first page of
the tax roll, and in respect to other lots, underneath the printed
heading 'block' appeared the written words 'Ewing Street;'"

STOUT v. MASTIN.
Opinion of the Court.

and the contention is, that where thereafter, on subsequent
pages, adjoining the printed word "block," appeared the written word "Armstrong," or "James," "Wood," or "Joy," it
was to be understood as describing not block but street; and
that the peculiarity of description obtaining in Kansas City,
Kansas, by lot and street rather than by lot and block, as
obtains elsewhere. in the State, was fully indicated by the
entry on the first page of the tax roll -in respect to " Ewing
Street." While it appears affirmatively from this ninth finding
that the custom was to describe lots by number and street, and
not by number and block, yet, it does not appear that there
were no blocks known by these descriptive names, "Armstrong," "Wood," "James," etc. It is common knowledge
that in many cities lots which are on streets, and are entitled
to the appropriate number of lots on such streets, have, in general understanding, a peculiar and separate description by virtue
of being in certain blocks, or facing on certain open squares;
and it is not found that such peculiarity of description, generally known and accepted, did not obtain in the city of Kansas
City, Kansas. If the description in the tax roll was inaccurate,
and it was sought to perfect that description by evidence aliunde,
it should have appeared affirmatively; not merely that the description by reasonable correction might apply to the lots in
controversy, but also that it was not applicable to any other
lots. Such fact does not appear in these findings; and as a
party claiming under a tax deed necessarily relies on the letter
of his bond, he cannot, where the description in the proceedings
upon: which his deed is based is inaccurate, content himself with
the act of the county clerk in making in the tax deed a sufficient correction, but must also show that the description in the
tax proceedings, though inaccurate, could not be mistaken.
From the findings of fact the conclusion of the Circuit Court
cannot be adjudged erroneous, and, therefore, its judgment for
