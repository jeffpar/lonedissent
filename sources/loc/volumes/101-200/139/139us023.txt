ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY C(. v. GREENALGH.

23

Opinion of the Court.

the grant, or by the State, yet the continued possession and
use of the propierty by the company were, in fact, subject to the
condition that the rights of settlers upon the lands at the time
should not be interfered with, where such settlements had been
made in good faith, as was the case in the present instance.
And it would be in the highest degree inequitable to allow the
company to have all the benefits of the extension of time to
complete its road, so as to avoid any forfeiture of its privileges and franchises, without at the same time holding it to
the conditions affecting t'ie rights of settlers upon the lands
of the company, in consideration of which the extension was
made.
We think, therefore, that the defendant James W. Greenalgh, under the patent issued to his co-defendant Charles, upon
proof of the latter's settlement and subsequent improvements,
had the better right to the land in controversy, and the decree
of the court, below is
