OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

We think that the thread composed partly of wool and
partly of cotton is a thread of "other materials" within the
meaning of the act. Congress having enacted that duties on
all-wool goods should not be evaded by the introduction of a
cotton thread, we can hardly conceive it possible that they intended to permit an evasion by the introduction of a thread
partly of wool and partly of cotton, making the fabric nearer
an all-wool fabric than if the thread had been composed
wholly of cotton.

WILSON v. EVERETT.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE

DISTRICT OF COLORADO.
No. 268. Argued and submitted March 26, 1891.-Decided April 13,1891.

Instructions to a jury upheld, where they could not have prejudiced the
party complaining.
On a writ of error, this court cannot review any error committed by a jury
in finding an amount of damages; nor take cognizance of a complaint
that a motion for a new trial was overruled, or that the verdict of the
jury was contrary to law and not warranted by the testimony.
As the writ of error was sued out merely for delay, this court awarded 10
per cent damages on the amount of the judgment, in addition to interest.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

MR. JUSTICE BL.TCHFoRD delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action at law, brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Colorado, by William S.
Everett and James M. Robinson, against William J.-Wilson,
to recover the sum of $65,000, for alleged services performed

Opinion of the Court.

by the plaintiffs at the request of the defendant, between
June 1, 1883, and November 1, 1885, in and about the sale of
certain lands and personal property..
The bill of particulars alleged that the services were rendered
at the request of the defendant in and about negotiating a sale
by him to the New United States Cattle Ranch Company,
Limited, of London, England, of the Circle Ranch, located on
the Republican River and its tributaries, in the States of Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska, with the appurtenances and the
cattle and horses which were, on or about December 14, 1883,
upon the range belonging to or connected with the said Circle
Ranch, and the buildings and dwellings, and certain personal
property belonging to or connected with the ranch, and thewater rights and other rights and privileges pertaining thereto.
A supplemental bill of particulars averred that the services
were rendered under an oral employment of the plaintiffs by
the defendant, by which they were to receive for their commissions, in the first instance, $5000, and all that the property
should sell for over $225,000; that this employment was made
some time in the summer or fall of 1883, and reiterated and
renewed in Chicago about February, 1884; that, by a subsequent arrangement; the defendant agreed to pay the further
sum of $10,000; that the services were rendered and negotiations were carried on, partly by letter, partly by telegram and
partly orally through agents of the plaintiffs in London, England; that it was impossible to state the time consumed in
such correspondence and'negotiations; that the same took
place at intervals between the time of the first employment
and the conclusion of the sale in the spring of 18841; that the
plaintiff Everett made one' trip from Chicago to Denver, in
December, 1883, occupying about two weeks, the purpose of
which was to confer with the defendant and settle and adjust
the terms of an agreement to be executed by the defendant
and to be submitted to the proposed purchaser; that both of
the plaintiffs made another trip to Denver, in February, 1884,
remaining three weeks or thereabouts; that there were oral
negotiations between the plaintiffs and the agents of the purchaser, both in Chicago and in Colorado, -hich extended over.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

several weeks; and that the number of hours or days consumed, or .the number of hours or days consumed in the
negotiations in London, could not be stated.
The answer of the defendant denied the allegations made.
Before the trial, the plaintiff Robinson died, and the cause
proceeded in the name of Everett as survivor, and was tried
by a jury, which rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, on the
21st of January, 1887, for $10,000.
On the next day, in the same term, the jurors being all
present and in the jury-box, the following interrogatory, presented by the plaintiff, was asked by the court of them: "Did
you include in your verdict the plaintiff's claim for any excess
over the sum of $225,000, denominated in the evidence the
surplus or profits?" To this the jurors by their* foreman
answered: "Our understanding is that Mr. Wilson never
rpceived anything in excess of 8225,000." It was ordered by
the court that this question and the answer thereto be entered
of record in connection with the verdict of the jury, for further
consideration as occasion might arise. The defendant moved
for a new trial, which motion was denied; and a judgment
was entered for the plaintiff for $10,000 and costs, to review
which the defendant has brought a writ of error.
The defendant specifies four parts 'of the charge of the
court to the jury, to which he excepted and of which he
complains. His principal contention is, that the plaintiff
ought not to have recovered more than $5000, and that the
allowance by the jury of more than that sum arose from the
alleged erroneous instructions excepted to.
The first alleged error is in giving the following instruction
to the jury: " N ow, with such an arrangement as this, obviously if it was carried out upon those terms, it was going
to be a question of some importance as to who was to wait
for the deferred payments - if the plaintiffs. were to wait, or
the defendant, Mr. Wilson, and whether Mr. Wilson would
be responsible directly to the plaintiffs for this money, or
whether he was only to stand in the relation of a sort of
trustee for them, and to give them the money whenever he
should get it from the English company; and, so far as I can

WILSON v. EVERETT.
Opinion of the Court.

see in the evidence, there is nothing very explicit upon that
subject, as to any understanding or agreement between them,
unless it may be what occurred in Chicago in February, 1884,
about the time these parties were coming over to look at the
property."
The instruction so complained of contains no proposition
of law, and merely calls the jury's attention to the matter of
fact in controversy, and to the absence of anything explicit
in the evidence on the subject. This instruction could have
worked no prejudice to the defendant, because the amount of
the verdict shows that the jury did not allow any part of the
plaintiff's claim based on a sale for an amount in excess of
8225,000, and their answer to the special inquiry of the
court also shows that they failed to do so. The contention
of the defendant that he never received anything in excess of
$225,000, therefore, was adopted by the jury. Furthermore,
the court subsequently instructed the jury that, if there was
any sum to be paid after the defendant should have received
$225,000, and only any such amount over that sum as he
should receive, he could not be liable for that, because he had
not yet received it.
The next alleged error is in the following instruction to the
jury: "I think Mr. Everett says that then there was an express understanding he was not only to have fifty thousand
dollars, which was in the understanding and agreement of the
parties up to that time, but that he was to have ten thousand
more, and five thousand more, making sixty-five thousand in
all, and that this was all to be paid by Mr. Wilson if the contract should go on. I believe Mr. Wilson denies this." This
is only a correct statement of what the respective parties
claimed, as the court understood the case, and there was no
intimation by it as to whether one claim or the other was
sustained by the evidence. The court further on, at the request of the defendant, stated to the jury that the weight of
the evidence, as to whether one witness or another should be
accepted, was. for their consideration, and said: "The force
and strength of the evidence is entirely as it shall stand with
you and affcct your judgment."

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The third alleged error is that the court instructed the jury
as follows: "Now, the question is what you can gather from
all that took place between them in the way of an agreement
on the part of Mr. Wilson to pay these parties for their services. Was there any agreement to pay them for their services; and, if so, how much and when was he to pay -upon
the completion of these contracts, after they were executed some part-and, if so, how much, and more, if it should be
received from the English company; and, if so, how much?
If his liability was contingent upon receiving the money Irom
the English company it must be said that he has not received
it - that is to say, parties have paid in money only the sixtythree thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and some
twenty-odd thousand dollars received from the sale of cattle,
which is to be counted as payment, and then what was got
under the sale of the chattel mortgage." We perceive no
error in this instruction.
The fourth alleged error is in instructing the jury as follows:
"If there was another and a different sum and a larger sum
. be paid only when it should be received from the
English
company in excess of the sum of two hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars, then he cannot be liable for that, because he
has not received that sum from the English company. I
think that ought to make plain to you the grounds upon which
you ought to proceed in arriving at a verdict in this case. If
you find from the evidence that any sum was due to these
plaintiffs upon the completion of this contract with this company -and by its completion I mean when it was executed
and the property was passed over, and so on, delivered to the
English company - then the plaintiffs are entitled to that.
If there was any sum to be paid after Mr. Wilson should haye
received two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, and'
only any such amount over that sum as he should receive
from the English company, then he cannot be liable for that,
because he hasnaot yet received it." We cannot see any error
in this instruction.
All the instructions complained of in these assignments of
error, except the second, involve only the matter of the surplus

Statement of the Case.

over $225,000, and, as it clearly appears that that portion of
the plaintiff's claim was disallowed, there could have been no
prejudice to the defendant.
The principal ground of complaint by the defendant seems
to be that the jury had no basis for finding a verdict for
$10,000, but that their verdict should have been for either
$5000 or $15,000. But this was a question to be reached only
through a motion for a new trial; and we cannot, on this
writ of error, review any error committed in that respect by
the jury, if there were one. Nor can we take cognizance of
the complaint that the court overruled the motion for a new
trial, or that the verdict of the jury was contrary to law and
not warranted by the testimony. The case was fairly submitted to the jury, and the issues involved were passed upon
by them.
As a supersedeas bond was given in this case, and thus the
writ of error has delayed the proceedings on the judgment,
and as it appears to us to have been sued out merely for delay,
we award damages on the amount of the judgment at the rate
of ten per centum, in addition to interest. Rev. Stat. § 1010;

NATAL v. LOUISIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

No. 2l. Argued and submitted March 30, 1891.-Decided April 13, 1891.
An ordinance passed by the city of New Orleans, under authority conferred

market within six squares of any public market of the city, under penalty
of being sentenced, upon conviction before a magistrate, to pay a fine of
twenty-five dollars, and to be imprisoned for not more than thirty days
if the fine is not paid, does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States.
