TREGEA v. MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 13. Argued January23, 24, 21, 1696.

Decided November 16, 1696.

The laws of California authorize the bringing of an action in its courts by
the board of directors of an irrigation district, to secure a judicial determination as to the validity of the proceedings of the board concerning a proposed issue of bonds of the district, in advance of their issue.
The Modesto District was duly organized under the laws of the State,
and its directors, having defined the boundaries of the district, and having determined upon an issue of bonds for the purpose of, carrying out
the objects for which it was created, as defined by the laws of the State,
commenced proceedings in a court of the State, seeking a judicial determination of the validity of the bonds which it proposed to issue. A
resident of the district appeared and filed an answer. After a hearing,
In which the defendant contended that tile judgment asked for would be
in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the proceedings
resulted in a judgment in favor of the district. Appeal being taken to
the Supreme Court of the State, it was there adjudged that the proceedigs were regular, and the judgment, with some modifications, was sustained. The case being brought here by writ of error, it is Held, that.a
Federal question was presented by the record, but that the proceeding
was only one to secure evidence; that in the securing of such evidence
no right protected by the Constitution of the United States was invaded;
that the State might determine for itself in what way it would secure
evidence of the regularity of the proceedings of any of its municipal
corporations; and that unless in the course of such proceedings some
constitutional right was denied to the individual, this court could not
interfere on the ground that the evidence might thereafter be used in
some further action in which there might be adversary claims.

ON March 7, 1887, the legislature of the State of California
passed an act, (Stat. Cal. 1887, 29,) whose scope and purpose
were disclosed in the first section:

OCTOBER TERM, 1896
Statement of the Case.
"SEC. 1. Whenever fifty, or a majority-of freeholders owning lands susceptible of one mode of irrigation from a common source, and by the same system of works, desire to
provide for the irrigation of the sane, they may propose the
organization of an irrigation district under the provisions of
this act, and when so organized such districts ,shall have the
powers conferred, or that m.ay hereafter be conferred, by law
upon such irrigation districts."
This act was amended in 1889 and 1891, (Stat. Cal. 1889,
15; 1891, 53, 142, 147, 274,) the amendments looking to a
mere perfection of the system. In a general way it may be
remarked that the system contemplated was substantially
this: Upon petition of the requisite number of inhabitants of
a proposed district and publication of -notice the board of
supervisors of the county in which the district, or the lai'ger
portion of it, was situated was required to examine into the
matter at a regular meeting, and after its determination to
give notice and call an election, at which all the electors of
the proposed district were entitled to vote. If two-thirds of
th&votes cast were in favor thereof an order was to be entered
on the minutes of the board declaring the proposed district
organized into a municipal corporation. Provision was made
for directors, three or five in number, to be elected from separate divisions or from the district at large, who constituted the
governing board of the new corporation. They had charge of
the construction of the irrigation works, of the levy of taxes, and
the borrowing of money. They were authorized to submit to
the voters the question of issuingbbnds for a specified amount,
such bonds to be the obligations of the district, and to be
paid by taxation in the ordinary manner of discharging
municipal obligations. Section 12 reads that "the use of all
water required for the irrigition of the lands of any district
fokmed under the provisions of this act, together with the
rights of way for canals and ditches, sites for reservoirs, and
all other property required in fully carrying out the provisions
of this act is hereby declared to be a public use, subject to
the regulation and control of the State, in the manner prescribed by law."

TREGEA v. MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

181

Statement of the Case.

This was simply carrying into the statute the language of
the state constitution, secti6n 1, article 14, which is as
follows:
"SEc. 1. The use of all water now appropriated, or that
may hereafter be appropriated, for sale, rental or distribution,
is hereby declared to be. a public use, and subject to the control and regulation of the State, in the manner to be prescribed by law."
The constitutionality of this law has been settled in the
case of Fallbrook Irrigtion .District v. Badley,'ante, 112,
just decided, which was argued with this case.
On February 16, 1889, two acts were passed, (Stat. Cal.
1889, 18, 21,) for changing the boundaries of irrigation districts by taking in adjacent territory or excluding some of the
territory within the original boundaries. On March 16, 1889,
(Stat. Cal. 1889, 212,) a further act was passed authorizing
action in the courts at the instance of the board of directors
for a judicial determination of the validity of the proceedings
in respect to the issue of bonds, and this, if desired, before the
bonds had been actually disposed of. The purpose of this act
is thus stated by the Supreme Court of California, in the
opinion filed in the present case:
"As the validity of the bonds when issued depends upon
the regularity of the proceedings of the board and upon the
ratification of the proposition by a majority of the electors,
it is matter of common knowledge that investors have been
unwilling to take them at their par value while all the facts
affecting their validity remain the sulject of question and
dispute."
"To meet this inconvenience, for the security of investors,
and to enable the irrigation districts to dispose of their bonds
on advantageous terms, the supplemental act under which this
proceeding was instituted was passed."
In the summer of 1887 the Modesto Irrigation District was
organized under authority of the act of March 7, 1887. The
conformity of the proceedings taken in its organization to the
requirements of the act is not denied. The area of the district
as organized was 108,000 acres. The board of directors, after

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Statement of the Case.

estimating and determining that $800,000 were necessary for
the proper construction of the irrigation works, ordered a
special election to be held on December 14, 1887, to enable
the voters of said district to pass upon the question of the
issue of bonds to.that amount. The'election was had, and resulted in a large majority in favor of the issuing of the bonds;
out of 515 votes cast, 439 were in the affirmative. On January 3, 1888, the board of directors met at a regular meeting
and ordered the bonds of the district to the amount of
;800,000 to be issued in the manner and form prescribed by
law. On or about June 4, 1889, certain parties owning tracts
of land within the boundaries of the irrigation district proceeded under the terms of the exclusion act to petition for an
exclusion of their lands from its limits. These proceedings
culminated in an order of July 20, 1889, excluding a tract of
28,000 acres, and leaving only 80,000 acres within the district.
On July 31, 1889, no bonds having as yet been issued under
the order of January 3, 1888, the board of directors entered a
new order for the- issue of bonds to the amount of $400,000.
The resolution which was passed described the denomination
and form of the bonds thus to be issued, and directed that
notice be given that sealed proposals would be received up
to September 3, 1889, for the purchase of such bonds. On
August 1, 1889, the day after the entry of the last order, a
petition was filed by the board of directors in the Superior
Court of Stanislaus County, seeking a judicial determination,
in accordance 'with the act of March 16, 1889, of the validity
of the proposed issue of bonds. The petition as filed set forth
only the order of July 31, 1889, for the issuance of bonds to
the amount of $400,000, and asked that they be declared valid.
In these proceedings Tregea, a resident of the district, appeared and filed an answer. The case, as between the board
of directors and Tregea, came on for trial on October 21, 1889,
and, after the testimony had all been received and during the
argument, the plaintiffs were permitted to amend their petition so to include therein the order of the directors of January 3, 1888, for the issue of $800,000 in bonds, and a prayer
for. the confirmation thereof. No one had notice of this

Statement of the Case.
amendment except the defendant Tregea. He demanded
that, in consequence of such amendment, a trial should be
had de tovo, but the court overruled his application, granted
leave to file an amended answer, and permitted further evidence only in respect to the new matter set out in such
amended pleadings. On November 29, 1889, written findings
of fact and conclusions of law were filed and judgment
entered, which judgment was in the following language:
"Wherefore, by reason of the law and the finding aforesaid,
it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the proceedings by
and under the direction of the board of supervisors of said
county which are recited in the said findings, which were had
for the organization of said irrigation district, the boundaries
of which are described in said finding, including in said proceedings the election in said finding mentioned, which was
held for the purpose of determining whether said proposed
district should be organized as an irrigation district, be, and
the same he,'eby are, approved and confirmed; and it is further
ordered, adjudged and decreed that the proceedings had by
and under the direction of the said board of directors which
are recited in said petition and said findings, which were had
for the purpose of the issue and sale of the bonds of said district to the amount of eight hundred thousand dollars; including in said proceedings the said election mentioned in said
petition and findings, which was held for the purpose of determining whether the bonds of said district should be issued;
also the proceedings by and under the direction of said board,
which are recited in said findings, by which a certain tract of
land in said findings described, which was included within the
boundaries of said district as it was organized as aforesaid,
was excluded from said district, and by which the boundaries
of said district are defined and described as said boundaries
were and remained upon and after the exclusion from said
district of said tract of land, which said boundaries are in said
findings described, and also the proceedings by and under the
direction of said board by which it was ordered that bonds of
said district to the amount of four hundred thousand dollars,
parcel of said amount of eight hundred thousand dollars of

Opinion of the Court.

said bonds, be offered for sale in the manner provided by law,
be, and each and all of said proceedings is, and are hereby,
approved and confirmed; and it is further ordered, adjudged
and decreed that the said Modesto Irrigation District; ever
since its organization as .aforesaid, has been and now is a duly
and legally Organized irrigation district, and that said irrigation district possesses fall power and authority to issue and
sell from time to time the bonds of said irrigation district to
the amount of eight hundred thousand dollars."
The defendant appealed from this judgment and decree to
the Supreme Court of the State which, on March 19, 1891,
modified the decree of the Superior Court by striking out so
ihuch thereof as confirmed the order of January 3, 1888, for
the issue of $800,000 of bonds of the district, and, as so modified, affirmed it. The opinion of that court is found in 88
California, 334. To reverse this judgmient of the Supreme
Court of the State the defendant sued out a writ of error
from this court.

MR.JUSTICE BREWER, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion.of the court.
A motion was made to dismiss this case on-the ground of
the lack of a Federal question. It appears from the opinion

TREGEA v. MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

185

Opinion of the Court.

of the Supreme Court of the State that the defendant contended before it that the attempt to bind the reconstituted
district- that is, the district diminished by the exclusion of
28,000 acres, and in which his property was situated-by a
vote of the district prior to such exclusion in respect to the
issue of bonds, was in violation of section 10, article I of the
Constitution of the United States; and that it overruled and
denied such contention. So there was considered by the
Supreme Court of the State the distinct question of an
alleged conflict between the proceedings confirmed by the
decree of the lower court and rights claimed under the' Constitution of the United States, and the decision was against
those rights. Further, the real contention of the defendant
was and is that the operation of this statute is to deprive him
of property without due process of lav. The burden of his
case from the first has rested in the alleged conflict between
proceedings had under the irrigation statute and the Federal
Constitution; so that beyond the express declaration in he
opinion of the Supreme Court of the State, we may look to
the real matter in dispute, and these unite In forbidding us
to say th'at no Federal question was presented. The motion
to dismiss on that ground must be overruled.
But going beyond this matter, we are confronted with the
question whether, in advance of the issue of bonds and before
any obligation has been assumed by the district, there is a
case or controversy with opposing parties, such as can be submitted to and can compel judicial consideration and judgment.
This is no mere technical question. For, notwithstanding the
adjudication by the courts of the State in favor of the validity
of the order made for the issue of four hundred thousand
dollars of bonds, and, notwithstanding any inquiry and determination which this court might make in respect to the
matters involved, there would still be no contract executed;
no obligation resting on the district. All that would be
accomplished by our affirmance of the decision of the state
court would be an adjudication of the right to make a contract, and, unless the board should see fit to proceed in the
exercise of the power thus held to exist, all the time and labor

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

of the court would be spent in determining a mere barren
right-a purely moot question.
We are not concerned with any question as to what-a State
may require of its judges and courts, nor with what measures
it may adopt for securing evidence of the regularity of the
proceedings of its municipal corporations. It may authorize
an auditor or other officer of state to examine the proceedings and make his certificate of regularity conclusive evidence
thereof, or it may permit the district to appeal to a court for
a like determination, but in either event it is a mere proceeding to secure evidence.
The directors of an irrigation district occupy no position antagonistic to the district. They are the agents and
the district is the principal. The interests are identical,
and it is practically an ex parte application on behalf of
the district for the determination of a question which may
never in fact arise. It may be true, as the Supreme Court
say, that it -is of advantage to the district to have some
prior determination of the -validity of the proceedings in
order to secure the sale of its bonds on more advantageous
terms, but that does not change the real character of this
proceeding.
This is not the mere reverse of an injunction suit brought
by an inhabitant of the district to restrain a board from issuing bonds, for in such case there-is an adversary proceeding.
Underlying it is the claim that the agent is proposing to do
for his principal that which he has no right to do, and to bind
him by a contract which he has no right to make; and to
protect his property from burden or cloud the taxpayer is
permitted'to invoke judicial determination. If in such suit an
injunction be granted, as is prayed for, the decision is not one
of a moot question, but is an adjudication which protects the
property of the taxpayer.
The power which the directors claim is a mere naked power,
and not a power coupled with an interest. It is nothing to
them, as agents, whether they issue the bonds or not; they
neither make nor lose by an exercise of the alleged power;
and if it be determined that the power exists, still no burden

TREGEA v. MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

1S7

Opinion of the Court.

is cast upon the property of the district because no bonds are
issued save by the voluntary act of the board.
It may well be doubted whether the adjudication really
binds anybody. Suppose the judgment of the court be that
the proceedings are irregular, and that no power has been by
them vested in the district board, and yet notwithstanding
such decision the board issues, as provided by the act, the
negotiable bonds of the district, will a bona fide purchaser of
those bonds be estopped by that judgment from recovering on
the bonds against the district? The doctrine of lis pendens
does not apply. Neither is any such adjudication binding
in respect to negotiable paper unless the party purchases
with .nowledge of the suit or the decree.

99 U. S. 362; Orleans v. Platt, 99 U. S. 676; Cass County
v. Gillett, 100 U. S. 585; Empire v. .Darlington, 101 U. S.

v. Smith, 111 U. S.556; Scotland County v. Hill, 112 U. S.
183.
The case of Carroll County v. Smith is instructive on this
question. In that case, before the issue of the bonds in suit,
an injunction had been issued by the chancery court of the
county enjoining the county officials from issuing and delivering the bQnds, which injunction was afterwards sustained and
made perpetual by the judgment and decree of the Supreme
Court of the State. Notwithstanding which the county offi.
cials fraudulently and illegally issued the bonds, .and this
court sustained a judgment on those bonds in favor of a bona
j.de holder, saying in the opinion: "The defendant in error
was no party to that suit, and the record of the judgment is
therefore no estoppel. The bonds were negotiable, and there
was, therefore, no constructive notice of any fraud or illegality by virtue of the doctrine of lis pendens. Marren County
v. MAarcy, 97 U. S.96. It is not alleged in the plea that the
defendant in error had actual notice of the litigation, or of the
grounds on which it proceeded, or that any injunction was
served upon the board of supervisors; and, if he had, that
notice would have been merely of the question of law, of

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

which, as we have seen, he is bound to take notice, at all
events, and which is now for adjudication in this case."
The case of Scotland County v. Bill, supra, contains noth-'
ing in conflict with this, for that deter.mines only the effect of
actual notice of the pendency of a suit, the point of the decision being expressed in these words of the Chief Justice:
"The case of Marren County v. Marcy, 97 U. S. 96, decides
that purchasers of negotiable securities are not chargeable
with constructive notice of the pendency of a suit affecting
the title or validity of the securities.; but it has never been
doubted that those who buy such securities from litigating
parties, with actual notice of the suit do so at their peril, and
must abide the result the same as the parties from whom they
got their title."
But if a judgment in such a proceeding as this cannot be
invoked by the district as res judicata in an action brought
against it by the holders of bonds thereafter wrongfully issued,
can a judgment in favor of the power be invoked by the
holder of such bonds as conclusive upon the district upon the
ground of res judicata? In order to create estoppel by judg- ment must there not be mutuality?
We do not mean to intimate that it may not have effect as evidence, like the certificate of an auditor declared by a legislature to be conclusive,
but is it not simply as evidence and not as resjudicata?
Some light rmay be thrown on this question by reference to
A matter of a somewhat. kindred nature. In States which
provide for the organization of corporations under general
statute different modes of procedure are prescribed. In some
States it is suffThient for the parties desiring to incorporate to.
prepare a charter, acknowledge it before some official, and file
it with the secretary of state, or other public officer, and the
certificate of such officer is made the evidence of the incorporation. In other States the parties may file a petition in
some court, and that court upon presentation thereof examines
into the propriety of the incorporation, and if satisfied thereof
enters a decree declaring the petitioners duly incorporated,
and the copy of such decree is th&evidenrce of the incorporation. Does the difference in procedure between these two

TREGEA v. MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

189

Opinion of Harlan, Gray and Brown, JJ.

cases create any essential difference in character? Is the-one
executive and the other judicial? Suppose, in the latter case,
the statute had provided that either one of the petitioners
might appeal from the decree of a lower to the Supreme
Court of the State, in order to obtain a final adjudication in
favor of the propriety of such incorporation, would this court
entertain a suit in error to reverse such adjudication by the
highest court of the State? Would it not be held in effect,
whatever the form, a mere expczrte case to obtain a judicial
opinion, upon which the parties might base further action?
It seems to us that this proceeding is after all nothing -but one
to secure evidence, that in the securing of such evidence no
right protected by the Constitution of the United States is
invaded, that the State may determine for itself in what way
it will secure evidence of the regularity of the proceedings of
any of its municipal corporations, and that unless in the course
of such proceeding some constitutional right is denied to the
individual, this court cannot interfere on the ground that.the
evidence may thereafter be used in some further action in
which there are adversary claims. So on this ground, and
not because no Federal question was insisted upon in the state
court, the case will be
Dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE GRAY and MR. JUSTICE
BROWN are of opinion that, as the judgment of the state court
was against a right and privilege specially set up and claimed
by the plaintiff in error under the Constitution of the United
States, such judgment, if not modified or reversed, will conclude him, if not all holders of taxable property in the Modesto Irrigation District, in respect of the Federal right and
privilege so alleged; consequently, it is the duty of this court
to determine, upon its merits, the Federal question so raised
by the pleadings and determined by the judgment of the state
court. They are also of opinion that the principles announced
in Fallbr'ook IrrigationDistrict v. Bradley, etc., just decided,
sustain the conclusions of the state court upon this Federal
question and require the affirmance of its judgment.
