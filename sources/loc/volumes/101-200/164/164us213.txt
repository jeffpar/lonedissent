Statement of the Case.

UNITED STATES v. VERDIER.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Wo.49. Argued October 20, 1896.- Decided November 16, 1896.

In actions in the Court of Claims interest prior to the judgment- cannot be
allowed to claimants, against the United States; but the provisions of
Rev.Stat. ยง 96G peremptorily require it to be allowed to the United States,
against claimants, under all circumstances to which the statute applies,
and without regard to equities which might be considered between private parties:

Tnis was a petition by the administrator of James R.
Verdier, deceased, for the payment of a balance of $1300.41
claimed to be due him upon a readjustment of his accounts
as postmaster at Beaufort, South Carolina, from July 1, 1866,
to April 30, 1869.
Upon a hearing in the Court of Claims that court made the
following findings of fact:
"1. James M. Verdier was a duly qualified postmaster at
Beaufort, S. C., from July 1, 1866, to the 30th day of April,
1869.
"2. Upon his retirement from office he appeared as indebted to the United States, on the face of his postal accounts,
in the sum of $929.20. June 28, 1870, an action was brought
by the United States against him on his official bond, in the
United States District Court of South Carolina, to recover
said sum, and July 5, 1870, the jury returned a verdict in
favor of the United States for the sum of $1063.20, which
verdict was, upon motion of Verdier's attorney, set aside.
"October 31, following, the attorney for said Verdier consented that the case be submitted to the court, and upon said
date the jury returned a verdict in favor of the United States
against Verdier for the sum of $1059.03; the costs were
$36.80; total, $1095.83. Judgment thereon was duly signed
January 25, 1871.
"3. November 3, 1885, application was made to the Postmaster General by- the administrator for a review and react-

justment of decedent's salary as postmaster aforesaid, under

the provisions of the act of March 3, 1883, c. 119, 22 Stat. 487.
December 23, 1885, said salary was readjusted and the sum of
$2892.84: found due said decedent's estate. August 4, 1886,
c. 903, a sum of money was appropriated by Congress to pay,
this and similar allowances. 24 Stat. 256, 307, 308.
"4. March 4, 1887, decedent's postal account was audited
,by the Auditor for the Post Office Department, who charged
his account with the aforesaid judgment and interest thereon
from July 5, 1870, to August 4, 1886 (the date of appropriation), and costs of suit, the total thereof being the sum of
$2296.77, and deducted this sum from the amount of salary
credited to said account, showing a balance of $596.07.

"June 20, 1887, .the United States attorney for the aforesaid district was instructed to satisfy said judgment, which
was accordingly done July 25, 1887.
"5. The sum of $596.07 was paid plaintiff, who gave the following receipt:
"'Mailed Sept. 14, 1887. Received Sept. 26, 1887,

General, No. 4655, for 596 dollars .07 cents in my
favor on the postmaster at New York, State of N; Y.,
to the

"'W. J. VERDIER, Admninistrator'"
Upon these facts the court found as a conclusion of law that
the petitioner was entitled to recover in the sum of $1233.57,

the United States appealed.

Mr.. JUSTicE BRoww, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.

UNITED STATES v. VERDIER.
Opinion of the Court.

The contest in this case is really over a question of interest.
Upon the termination of his services as postmaster, Verdier
was found, upon the face of his accounts, to be indebted to
the government. Suit was brought against him upon his
bond, and a verdict obtained July 5, 1870, for $1063.20, which
was subsequently set aside; but the action ultimately resulted in a judgment against him, rendered Janu'ary 25, 1871,
in the sum of $1095.83.
By Rev. Stat. ยง 966, "interest shall be allowed on all judgments in civil causes recovered in a circuit or district court
in all cases where, by the law of the State in which
such court is held, interest may be levied under process of
execution on judgmerts recovered in the courts of such State;
and it shall be calculated from the date of the judgment, at
such rate as allowed by law on judgments recovered in the
courts of such State." We see no reason why this section, or
ยง 3624, fixing the rate of interest upon delinquent accounts of
public officers at six per cent, does not apply to this case.
Verdier was, therefore, properly charged with interest upon
the judgment. Anis v. Smith, 16 Pet. 303.
By the act of July 1, 1864, c. 197, 13 Stat. 335, the system
which had theretofore prevailed of paying postmasters by a
commission upon the receipts of their offices was changed;
and postmasters were divided into five classes, and paid by a
salary gauged by'their compensation for the two consecutive
years preceding the act. The classification of postmasters
was determined by the Postmaster General upon the basis
of the c6minissions previously paid to them, and the exact
amount of their salaries fixed within certain limitations provided by the act for each class. There was a further provision in the second section that the salary should be reviewed
and readjusted by the Postmaster General once in two years,
upon the basis upon which the salary was originally fixed;
but that such change should not take effect until the first day
of the quarter next following the order for the same. This
section was amended by the act of June 12, 1866, c. 114, 14
Stat. 59, 60, by adding a proviso that when the quarterly
returns of any postmaster showed that the salary allowed was

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

ten per cent less than it would have been on a basis of commissions, the Postmaster General should review and readjust
under the provisions of the prior act.
It will be observed that these acts of 1864 and 1866- were
both prospective in their operation. United States v. cLean,
95 U. S. 750. We mrst assume that when Verdier took office
July 1, 1866, his sala:y was fixed by the Postmaster General
under the act of 1864, this being the date at which the first
biennial term fixed by the act of 1864 expired. It would
seem that no readjustment could then be made until the lapse
of two years, or until July, 1868, unless, upon satisfactory
representation, it was deemed expedient by the Postmaster
General. If a readjustment had been made under these acts,
it would have operated prospectively only, and until April 30,
1869, when he ceased to serve as postmaster. Why a readjustment was not made does not appear. It may have been
for the absence of quarterly returns, as there is no finding that
such returns were made. It may have been by simple neglect
of the Postmaster :General to comply with the law; but there
is no evidence of his refusal to do so, and in any event the
government would not be liable for his n6glect in that particular. United States v. Eirkpatrick,9 Wheat. 720; United
States v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 565. It was not until 1883 that
the Postmaster General was authorized to readjust the compensation of postmasters and to make such readjustments
retrospective.
By the act of March 3, 1883, c. 119, 22 Stat. 487, the Postmaster General was authorized and directed to readjust the
salaries of postmasters, whose salaries had not theretofore
been readjusted under the act of 1866, "who had made sworn
returns of their receipts and business for readjustment of
salary" to the department, or who had "made quarterly
returns in conformity to the then existing laws and regulations, showing that the salary allowed was ten per centum
less than it woul have been upon the basis of commissions,"
such readjustment to be made in accordance with the act of
1866, and "to date from the beginning of the quarter succeeding that in which such sworn returns of receipts and business

Opinion of the Court.

or quarterly returns were made; provided, that every readjustment of salary under this act shall be upon a written application signed by the postmaster or late postmaster or legal
representative entitled to such readjustment."
Pursuant to this statute application was made by the administrator of Verdier for a review and readjustment of his salary
as postmaster, and on December 23, 1885, his salary was readjusted, and the sum of $2092.8-1 found to be due his estate.
On August 4, 1886, an act was passed by Congress, c. 903,
24 Stat. 2.56, 307, appropriating a sum of money to pay this
and similar allowances. Verdier's account was finally audited
March 4, 1887. In this statement he was charged with the
judgment and interest thereon from July 5, 1870, to August 4,
1886 (the date of the appropriation), the total being the sum of
$2296.77, and was credited with the amount of his readjusted
salary and a balance of $596.07 found to be due him. This
sum was subsequently paid, the receipt of petitioner's administrator taken for the amount, and the judgment against Verdier
satisfied of record July 25, 1887. On September 28, 1888, this
petition was filed to recover the difference between the original verdict and the amount which was deducted from his
readjusted salary upon final settlement.
By the act of 1883 no readjustment could be made, except
upon the application of the postmaster, and when that application was made in this case, the salary was for th6 first time
readjusted. Until this time the debt was not liquidated-in
fact it would be more accurate to say that it did not exist.
Th6 argument is made that, as the readjusted salary was earned
prior to the verdict against Verdier of July 5, 1870, he ought
not to be charged with interest upon the judgment against
him for the sixteen years which elapsed from that time until
August, 1886, when the act of Congress appropriating money
for the payment of readjusted salaries was passed; or, which
is nearly the same thing, that the government should be
charged with interest upon his readjusted compensation from
the time he'left the office. It would certainly seem to be equitable that, if the government were indebted to Verdier at the
time it obtained judgment against him, it should not charge

Opinion of the Court.

him with interest upon its judgment. But interest being a
matter of purely statutory regulation, we are bound to give or
withhold it as the statute directs. By the judgment of the
District Court of South Carolina, Verdier became i~ndebted to
the government on January 25, 1871, in the sum of $1095.83,
and as lie did not pay the debt at the time, he. was properly
chargeable with interest. Rev. Stat. ยง 966.
Upon the other hand, the government did not become a
debtor to Verdier until his claim was liquidated, and by Rev.
Stat. ยง 1091, no interest can be allowed upon any claim against
the government up to the time of the rendition of judgment
thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly
stipulating for the payment of interest. The theory upon
which interest is claimed seems to be that the Postmaster
Genera] was in fault for not' having readjusted Verdier's salary
under the act of 1866, and that Verdier ought not to be prejudiced by such default. The Whole difficulty in the case, however, arises from the fact that there were claims upon both
sides. Did the case of the government stand alone, there
could be no doubt whatever that Verdier's estate would be
properly chargeable with interest. Upon the- other hand, if
his accounts had been settled and paid at the expiration of

his term, and a claim were now made under the act of 1883,
it would not be claimed that the government would be chargeable with interest. The equity of petitioner's claim, if there
be any, arises from the fact that while interest was running
against him on his judgment, the government was equitably his
debtor. Were the case between private individuals perhaps
interest would be chargeable to both parties; but we are
unable to see how the fact that there were mutual claims can
authorize us to disregard the plain letter of the statutes.
There is really no greater hardship in denying the petitioner
interest than there would have been if he had not been a
judgment debtor of the government.
An inherent vice of .petitioner's argument is in the assump.tion that he and the government stand upon an equality with
respect to interest. The truth is that in its dealings with
individuals public policy demands that the government

UNITED STATES v. VERDIER.
Opinion of the Court.

should occupy an apparently favored position. It may sue,
but, except by its own consent, cannot be sued. In the matter of costs it recovers but does not pay, and the liability of
the individual would not be affected by the fact he had a
judgment against the government which did not carry costs.
So the statute of limitations may be pleaded by the government, but not against it ; nor is it affected by the laches of its
officers. United ,ites v. Barker, 2 Wheat. 395; T/te Antelope, 12 Wheat. 54:6; United States v. .foLemore, 4 How.
286; United States v. Boyd, 5 How. 29; United States v.
98 U. S. 486; Simmons v. Ogle, 105 U. S. 271;
Thomp)sozn,
United States v. Ki 'patrick, 9 Wheat. 720; United States
v. Nic oll, 12 Wheat. 505; Gaussen v. United States, 97
U. S. 584. Under the bankruptcy law, it was a preferred
creditor, and its claims were paid even before the wages of
operatives, clerks or house servants. Rev. Stat. ยง 5101. In
short, the equities which arise as between individuals have
but a limited application as between the government and a
citizen.
Nor is it strictly true to say that the government was indebted to Verdier at the date of its judgment against him.
He had performed services for which an indebtedness was
subsequently voluntarily created by the government; but
until the readjustment was made the law imposed no obligation upon the government to pay him an increased salary.
Verdier could not have availed himself of it as a set off or
counter claim to his own debt tG the government, and in fact
it never became a debt until the claim was liquidated under
the act of 1883. As was said by this court in United States
.Lean,
95 U. S. 750, 753: "The law imposes no obligav. M
tion upon the government to pay an increased salary unless
a readjustment has preceded it. And by the act of 1866 the
Postmaster General is not to readjust an existing salary unless the quarterly returns made show cause for it. Now, if
it be conceded that the quarterly returns madb on the last
day of each quarter, beginning with June 30, 1871, made it
the duty of the Postmaster General to make a readjustment
immediately on the receipt of the returns, still his readjust-

ment was an executive act made necessary by the law in
order to perfeQt any liability of the government. If the executive officer failed to do his duty, he might have been constrained by a mandamus. But the courts cannot pe~formn
executive duties or treat them as performed when they have
been neglected. They cannot enforce rights which are dependent for their existence upon a prior performance by
an executive officer of certain duties he has failed to perform.
The right asserted by the claimant rests upon a condition
unfulfilled." In that case, as stated by Mr. Justice Miller in
Af3cLean v. 7ilas, 124 U. S. 86, 87, this court held that the
Court of Claims could not "perform the duty of readjusting
the salary under the acts which conferred that power on the
Postmaster General, and that there was no legal liability
against the United States for the amount claimed by him
until that officer had readjusted the salary in accordance
with those acts of Oongress"; and in Mc Lean v. 'Filasit was
held that the statute did not contemplate. a readjustment
oftener than once in two years as a legal duty or obligation
on the part of the Postnaster General.
Verdier's claim for interest in this case is based upon the
assumption that the Postmaster General neglected his duty
in failing to readjust his salary. We have shown that if he
had performed his statutory duty his action would have been
prospective only, and would have covered but comparatively
a short period of Verdier's services; but however this may
be, the government is not chargeable for his neglect in that
particular.
It results'that the judgment of the court below must be
reversed, and the case remanded with direction to dismiss the
petition.
MR.TUSTICE GizY did not hear the argument and took no
part in the decision of this case.
