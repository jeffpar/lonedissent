APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT
FOR THE

COURT OF THE UNITED

NORTHERN DISTRICT

No. 196. Argued March 30, April 3,1893.-

STATES

OF ILLINOIS.

Decided April 24,1893.

A debt due from a railroad company to a car company for rental of cars
prior to the commencement of a suit to foreclose a mortgage on the road
and the appointment of a receiver, is held not to be a preferred debt,
having priority over the mortgage debt.
A similar debt accrued during the receivership is examined, and is settled
as to amount and allowed.
The car company in such case is not allowed interest.
After property of an insolvent passes into the hands of a receiver or of an
assignee in insolvency, interest is not allowed on the claims against the
fund.

Tins is an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, in a
proceeding to foreclose a mortgage executed by the Peoria
and Rock Island Railway Company to secure its first mortgage bonds to the amount of $1,500,000.
The original bill was filed in October, 1874, by Veeder G.

of the State of Nqew Jersey, as holders of certain mortgage
bonds, and on behalf of all of the holders of such bonds.
Among others it made the trustee in the mortgage given to
secure the bonds, and William R. Hamilton, Benjamin E.
Smith and William Denmson, defendants, and, beside setting
forth the default in the covenants of the mortgage, charged,
among other things, that these mortgage bonds were issued,
as it was represented, for the purpose of constructing and
equipping the said railroad, and that they were placed upon
the market for general sale by the firm of Turner Bros.,
bankers, of the city of New York, who assumed and represented themselves to be the financial agents for the railway
company, and, as such agents, represented by pamphlets,
statements, and otherwise that the road of the said railway
company was a completed road, built by subscriptions to its
capital stock, that the capital stock, amounting to $2,000,000,
had all been paid in, that the said road was open and being
operated successfully; and, finally, that the said bonds were
offered for sale by the said company for the purpose of placing upon the road the equipment necessary for the business
offered, and to construct cars, engines, depots, and machinehouses, such as were required by the business of the company
The bill charges that the complainants purchased and became the holders of their bonds in reliance upon these representations, and that the entire issue of bonds was sold by
Turner Bros. under like representations, that these representations were in fact false and fraudulent, and that the officers
of the railway company and the defendants, Smith, Dennison,
and Hamilton, directed and authorized them to be made,
knowing them to be false. It is charged that in June, 1870,
while Hamilton was president of the railway company, a contract was made with Smith and his associates for the construction of the railroad, and that Dennison was one of the
associates of Smith in this contract, that by the terms of the
contract Smith and his associates agreed to iron, depot, and
moderately equip with rolling stock the railway, and the railway company was to deliver to him, for himself and associates

Statement of the Case.

$1,250,000 of the capital stock of the company, and the entire
$1,500,000 of the first mortgage bonds, that the $1,250,000
of the capital stock was immediately upon the making of the
contract issued and delivered to Smith for himself and his
associates, being a large majority of all of the capital stock of
the company, and that Smith and Dennison and their associates thereby obtained absolute control of the management of
the railway company, and caused such officers and directors to
be elected as were friendly to their schemes and in their control, that the road was insufficiently constructed and insufficiently equipped on the part of Smith and his associates, that,
desiring to sell the bonds, and having control of the manage.
ment of the company, Smith and his associates fraudulently
caused the bonds to be offered for sale through Turner Bros.
as the financial agents of the railway company, and as for its
benefit upon the said representations, and that in fact the
bonds were not put upon the market and sold for the benefit
of the railway company, and it was not intended or expected
to use the proceeds thereof for the purpose of placing the
necessary equipment upon the road as was represented, but,
on the contrary, the entire proceeds of the bonds were received
by and divided among Smith and his associates, and that the
railway company has never had any other or greater equipment of rolling stock than that furnished by Smith under his
construction contract before the sale of the bonds.
The bill charges further that in 1871, owning and controlling the capital stock of the railway company, Smith and his
associates caused Smith, Dennison, and Hamilton, and others
in their interest, to be elected directors, Hamilton to be elected
president, and Smith to be elected vice-president of the railway company, and that as such they continued to control the
affairs of the railway company down to the time of the filing
of the bill.
Among other charges of fraud in the bill it is charged that
Smith, Dennison, and others of the directors of the railway
company had caused the railway company to hire cars from
the Western Car Company at an exorbitant rate, and that
these contracts for the use of cars were made and continued

by reason of the control of Smith and his associates over the
affairs of the railway company
The bill sought a foreclosure of the mortgage and prayed
for the appointment of a receiver.
On the 23d of January, 1875, an order was entered appointing John R. Hilliard receiver of the Peoria and Rock Island
Railway Company and its property, and on the 1st of February, 1875, Iilliard, as receiver, went into the possession and
into the operation of the said railway Hilliard remained in
control and operated the railroad until after its sale in 1877,
and until possession was delivered by him, under the order of
court, to the purchasers who had become organized as the
Rock Island and Peoria Railroad Company, and who have
ever since operated this railroad.
A decree of foreclosure was rendered on the 11th day of
January, 1877. It.directed a sale to be made by the master
in chancery of the franchises and property of the railway
company It contained directions as to the application of the
proceeds of the sale, ordering, among other things, that, after
payment of specific sums provided for, the balance should be
paid to the clerk of the court, who should apply the same,
under the direction of the court, first, to the payment of all
remaining claims of intervening creditors, as they should be
allowed by the court, and next to the payment of the bonds
and coupons secured by the mortgage, which should be outstanding and unpaid. It authorized the master to receive
from the purchaser or purchasers, after payment of the sum
of $100,000 of the amount of his bid, for the balance of the
sum bid, in lieu of cash, outstanding and unpaid bonds and
coupons at such percentage as the court should direct on the
approval of the sale, and it authorized the purchaser or purchasers of the property and franchises of the railway company
to reorganize under and by virtue of the provisions of the
charter of the said railway company, and to be invested with
all the rights, franchises, privileges, and powers of the said
railway company
On September 17, 1877, an order was entered approving
the master's report of sale, and ordering that the sale made

to Ransom R. Cable for $550,000 be confirmed. The purchaser Cable was directed by this order to deposit all such
bonds and coupons as he should desire to pay in on account
of the purchase with the clerk of the court. The court also
ordered that all petitioners for allowance of intervening claims
complete their proofs of such claims by the 1st of October,
1877.
On the 14th of December, 1877, an order was entered by
the court approving the report of the master, showing the
execution of a deed by him of the property under the foreclosure decree to the Rock Island and Peoria Railway Company, in pursuance of an order entered on the 11th of
December, 1877, and approving the deed, a copy of which is
set forth in the order. This order also approved penal bonds
in the sum of $100,000 each, payable to the clerk of the court,
for the use of whomsoever should become interested, one of
such bonds being expressly conditioned for the payment to
the Western Car Company of any amount which should be
found due to it, reciting the intervention of that company and
the claims asserted by it against the proceeds of the sale of
the property of the railway company
The original intervening petition of the Western Car Company in this cause was filed on the 11th of December, 1876.
It asserted that at the time of the appointment of the receiver
the railway company was indgbted to the car company in the
sum of $35,106.49 and interest thereon, for car rentals under
contracts made between the railway company and the car
company It also claimed the sum of $1500 under the terms
of these car contracts for the value of 2 box cars destroyed
by the railway company and not replaced. It claimed that
the furnishing of cars to the railway company under these
contracts was in the nature of supplies furnished to it by
means whereof the company had been enabled to transact its
business, and prayed that the receiver might be ordered to
pay his indebtedness to the petitioner out of any moneys in his
hands or income received from the business of the railway
company
To this original petition were attached statements of account,

as exhibits, showing the amount claimed by the car company
against the railway company prior to the appointment of the
receiver, and also copies of two contracts between the car
company and the railway company, one bearing date Aarch
5, 1872, for the leasing of 70 box cars and 20 stock cars, the
other bearing date October 1, 1873, for the leasing of 150 box
cars.
To this original petition answers were filed by both the
complainants in the original cause and the receiver. The
answer of the complainants in the original cause charged that
these contracts were fraudulent and void, for the reason that
at the time when they were made Benjamin E. Smith was the
owner of a large amount of the stock of the car company, and
its president and in control of its operations, and Hamilton
was the owner of a considerable portion of its stock,,and the
remainder of its stock was owned and controlled by the
associates of Smith and Hamilton, that at the same time
Smith was the vice-president of the railway company and the
owner and holder of a great portion of its stock, and controlling its operations through the officers and agents whom he
named and appointed, and Hamilton was the president of
the railway company, and that Smith, Hamilton, and their
associates owned and controlled the majority of its capital
stock, and with their associates combined to defraud the
owners and holders of the firtt mortgage bonds, and made
these contracts for leasing cars for that purpose. The answer
further charges that the rental reserved by these contracts
was exorbitant, and that the fair rental for the cars in question did not exceed the sum of $10 per month per car, whereas
the contracts reserved a rental of $20 per month per car,
and that the car company received from the railway company
moneys to the amount of more than 876,000.
The answer of the receiver stated that the books of the railway
company showed credits to the car company for rental of cars
to the amount of $115,686.70, and payments made to the car
company prior to his appointment, amounting to $76,031.70,
and that since his appointment he had paid over to the car
company, under the order of court, $6237.01. It alleged that

the two cars were destroyed in the possession of the railway
company more than six months prior to his appointment, and
charged that the rental reserved by the contracts was extortionate, and that the cars were not worth to the railway company and could not be made worth more than from $7 to $10
per month per car. The receiver also stated that he had not as
receiver used these cars under the said contracts, or in anywise
adopted, recognized or confirmed the contracts.
Both answers, that of the complainants to the original bill
and of the receiver, denied that the rental of the cars was in
the nature of supplies or that the car company should have
precedence or priority awarded to it over the bondholders.
On March 14, 1877, the car company filed its amended petition. In this it represented that when Hilliard was appointed
receiver the railway company was in possession of 240 cars
belonging to the car company under the two contracts. That
on June 11, 1875, the former contracts were modified and
changed by another contract made between it and the receiver,
by which it rented to the receiver 138 of these cars, and that
an additional clause was appended to that contract renting to
the receiver 56 other cars. The amended petition set out
verbatim this contract with the receiver and the additional
clause appended to it, and charged that the receiver continued
in possession and use of the 138 cars and the 56 cars, and
claimed that there was due from the receiver to the car company for the rental of these cars $15,281.34, with interest.
It is also claimed that the rental due for the use of its cars
by the receiver was in the nature of a current operating expense, and a lien on the road and its property superior to that
of the mortgage, and prayed that in case the fund in the hands
of the receiver should not be sufficient to pay these claims, the
payment thereof might be enforced as a first lien on the road
and property of the railway company, and paid out of the
proceeds of any sale thereof.
To this amended petition were attached statements of rentals
charged to be due to the car company from the receiver.
On -ay 26, 1877, an order was entered, directing the
amendment to the petition of the car company, filed March

14, 1877, to be stricken out as an amendment to the petition
theretofore filed, and ordering that it stand as a petition
against the receiver, and giving the car company leave to file
a supplemental petition.
This supplemental petition was filed May 26, 1877. It
averred, as supplementary matter, that the receiver had notified the car company that he would not keep the 138 cars in
service after May 1, and that he had returned 88 of said cars,
and proposed returning the remaining 50, that the receiver
had neglected to keep the cars in repair, as provided in the
contract, and had returned them in bad order and out of repair, and that the car company had been obliged to put them
in the shops for repairs, and had thereby sustained large
damages.
That as to the 56 cars, and to the rental due on them, the
receiver had notified the car company that he did not, and
would not, recognize any liability to it for the use or rental
of the 56 cars.
On the 27th of June, 1877, the receiver filed his answer to
the amended petition of the car company, in which he stated
that when he took possession as receiver of the property of the
railway company only 135 of the 138 cars came into his possession. That during the months of February and March,
1875, he used the 135 cars and paid the car company $12 per
month per car, that about April, 1875, he obtained leave from
the court to rent these cars at a rate not to exceed $10 per
month per car, and executed the agreement dated June 11,
1875, a copy of which is set out in the amended petition of the
car company
That in April, 1877, he became satisfied that the cars so
rented could not be used to advantage at the rental of $10 per
month, and notified the car company that he should return
them on May 1, 1877, and that he did return them from time
to time, as collected.
That when he received these cars into his possession as receiver they were in poor condition and out of repair, and he
was obliged to and did make large and extensive repairs on
them, and that he kept them and returned them in better re-

pair than when he received them, and that they were in good
repair for use on said road.
As to the 56 cars the receiver stated that he did not receive
these cars from the car company, and did not agree with the
car company to pay it any rental for them, and never executed
and delivered to the car company the alleged writing in reference to the same, that Mr. Ingersoll, who was his attorney and
the attorney of the car company, brought a replevin suit in the
United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Elinois against the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company,
and under the replevin writ in that suit caused the 56 cars to
be seized, he and one Whiting giving the bond necessary for
the obtaining of the writ, and, in order that the bondsmen
might have security to indemnify themselves upon their bond,
they kept these cars in their possession and obtained leave
from the receiver to store them on the side tracks held by him
as receiver; that it was afterwards agreed between Ingersoll
and the receiver that when the receiver should have occasion
to use more cars than he then had as receiver he might use
these 56 cars, paying the usual mileage rate of one cent per
mile run, when the replevin suit should be determined, but that
the cars should only be used for the local business of the receiver's road, and should not be allowed to run or go off from
that road. The answer further stated that he had used the
cars to some extent under his agreement, and was ready to
account for such use when the replevin suit should be determined, and to surrender the cars at that time.
The answer farther stated that in 1875 the general agent of
the car company was in Peoria, and that Ingersoll and this
general agent then expected the replevin suit to be decided
before the December following, and this agent desired, if this
was done, to make some arrangement for renting these 56 cars
without being required to return them again to Peoria, and the
copy of the contract of June 11, 1875, belonging to the receiver, being then in the possession of Ingersoll, as the receiver's
attorney, Ingersoll endorsed upon it the additional clause or
memorandum, a copy of which the car company had set out in
its amended petition, and the receiver signed this as a memo-

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

randum, but it was never given to or delivered to the car
company or any one for it, and never passed out of the control
of the receiver, and that the receiver had, and claimed to have,
no power or authority or intention to make any contract for
the rental of the said cars, and instructed his attorney not to
allow this memorandum to go out of his possession or to make
any contract in relation thereto, even if the replevin suit should
be decided, unless the court should first authorize the making
of such contract as to the said 56 cars. And the receiver
averred that the replevin suit had never been decided, that he
had never had the full use of the cars, and denied that he
owed any rental thereon, and stated that he had never applied
for leave of court to make any contract for the rental of the 56
cars, because the circumstances under which such contract was
to be made had never arisen.
On July 3, 1877, the complainants in the original cause
filed an amended answer to the petition of the car company,
in which the car company asserted and asked for payment
of the balance due for rentals prior to the appointment of the
receiver. This amended answer sets out more strongly the
alleged fraudulent character of these car contracts between
the car company and the railway company
It shows the construction contract on June 1, 1870, made
by the railway company with Benjamin E. Smith and his
associates, that Smith was the president of the car company,
and Dennison and others were associates of Smith in the construction contract and in the car partnership and company,
that Smith and his associates received from the railway company 12,000 shares of its stock, which constituted a large
majority of the entire stock, and also received all of the first
mortgage bonds of the company, that they caused these bonds
to be advertised for sale and procured their sale by means of
false representations, representing, among other things, that
the bonds were sold by the railway company for the purpose
of placing the necessary equipment upon its road, and that
complainants purchased their bonds relying upon these false
representations, and they charged that in fact the bonds were
not held by the railway company nor were the proceeds thereof

THOMAS v. WESTERN CAR COMPANY.
Statement of the Case.

used in furnishing the equipment for its road, but were used
for the private benefit of Smith and his associates.
This amended answer further shows that about January 1,
1872, Smith and his associates united themselves together in
a partnership known as the Western Car Company, and that
Hamilton, who was then the president of the railway company, and Charles W Smith, who had been appointed by
Benjamin E. Smith the general manager of the railway company, also became partners in this car partnership, and that
the partnership furnished the cars to the railway company
and made these contracts with it under these circumstances,
that afterwards Smith and his associates and other partners
in the Western Car Company organized themselves into a
corporation under the laws of Delaware, but that this corporation was but a continuation of the partnership bearing the
same name, and was controlled, governed and directed by
Smith and his associates.
That during 1872 and until the 1st of February, 1875, Smith
and his associates controlled and dictated all the contracts
and business operations of the railway company, that Hamilton, its president, Benjamin E. Smith, its vice-president, and
all of its directors were chosen and appointed by Smith and
his associates, that the contracts made and dictated by them
were fraudulent and void in equity, and that the amount
agreed by these contracts to be paid as rental was grossly
excessive.
They claimed further that the railway company had paid
to the car company for the use of its cars more than their use
was worth, and that the car company should be precluded
from claiming any sum whatsoever as due for rental, and was
estopped from claiming to own the cars.
On October 16, 1877, which was after the time fixed by the
court for closing proofs in all intervening claims, the car company filed a further amendment to each of its intervening
petitions. Its original petition it amended by praying that
whatsoever sum should be found due to it might be paid out
of the proceeds of the sale of the road. It also alleged that
the reasonable rental for all the cars named in each of its peti-

OCTOBER TERM:, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

tions, irrespective of any contract price, was, up to the end of
July, 1874, $20 per month per car, and from that time to the
appointment of the receiver $15 per month per car, and from
that time on at least such amount as is named in the contract
between it and the receiver.
Its petition against the receiver it amended by charging
that at the time of the appointment of the receiver and of his
entry into the possession of the railway, he took possession of
100 cars which had been rented by it to the railway company,
and which were known as White Line cars, that the receiver
held these cars for some months and returned them some
time in March or April, 1875, in bad condition and out of
repair, and that the petitioner upon receiving them was
obliged to expend moneys in their repair.
It also charged, as to the 56 cars, that the replevin suit con.
cerning them had been decided by the court m favor of the
car company, that since the receiver was appointed he had
held and claimed the right to hold these cars, pending the
replevin suit, and refused to pay rent for them, and it claimed
rental due for their use, amounting to $13,000. It also claimed
that these 56 cars were badly out of repair, and so damaged
for want of ordinary necessary repairs that it would cost the
car company $9500 to put them in good repair.
Afterwards, and on October 31, 1877, it filed a petition
praying for an order directing the receiver to return the 56
cars, and on this petition the receiver was ordered to surrender
and deliver these cars to the car company
On these issues a large quantity of evidence was offered
before the master by both parties.
The respondents claimed that the only amounts that were
in equity due to the petitioner, and should be allowed to it
from the fund in court, were the balance of rentals due from
the receiver on the 134 cars, $8789.86, the mileage earned by
the 56 cars, $3496.78, and the value of one car lost and not
returned by the receiver, $450, making a total of $12,736.64.
The master's report in this intervening cause, filed June 22,
1885, found, as to the amount claimed as due from the railway company prior to the receivership, that the question as to

THOMAS v. WESTERN CAR COMPANY.
Statement of the Case.

whether the contracts were fraudulent and void was "ummportant," in view of "the practice of the court in cases of this
character to allow against the fund or the receiver claims of
this kind established by the testimony as reasonable and just,
which have accrued during the period of six months prior to
the appointment of the receiver, and during the receivership,
independent of any contracts which may have previously
existed, unless such contracts have been recognized and
adopted by the court", and that for the period of six months
prior to the receivership there was due the car company a balance of $2062.99. The master disallowed claims as to lost cars
and repairs on White Line cars.
As to the claims against the receiver, the master found the
car company entitled to the balance remaining unpaid of the
rental of the 135 cars, at the rate which the receiver had
agreed to pay, amounting to $8807.97. He also found under
protest the car company entitled to the sum of $14,046.55
paid out for repairing these cars after their return by the
receiver. As to this allowance for repairs, the report says
"I have found it difficult to deal with this branch of the case
for the reason that while it appears that the bills which have
been presented for these repairs were actually paid by the
petitioner, it is also evident in many instances these repairs
were extravagantly conducted, and that in many respects they
were rendered necessary by their condition before they came
into the hands of the receiver, and there is much testimony in
the case showing this to have been the fact. It is also apparent from the testimony that in many cases cars were practically rebuilt and renewed. Upon a very careful examination
of all the testimony bearing on this branch of the petitioner's
claim, I find it impossible to separate items of this account in
such a way as to equitably charge this respondent with such
portion of the repairs as he should be called upon to pay upon
the basis of the claim of the petitioner, although in my estimation the effect of the testimony is to show that a credit at
least to some extent of the amount charged by the petitioner
upon this item should be applied to the reduction of this
claim,"

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

The master allowed the petitioner mileage on the 56 cars
up to December 1, 1875, and a rental of $10 per car per month
from then until they were surrendered, although, as he says,
"perhaps it (a contract as to these cars) was not finally consummated or delivered." He also allowed $5650, the full
amount claimed as expended in repairing these latter cars,
though he finds that they came into the receiver's possession
in bad condition, for the same reason which he had given as
to the claim for repairs to the 138 cars, that he was unable to
make an equitable distribution of this. The master disallowed
all claims for interest, and found the total amount of $43,816.69
due to the car company
To this report exceptions were taken by the car company,
the complainants in the original bill, and the receiver, which
were argued before Mr. Justice Harlan in June, 1887, and on
August 29, 1888, his opinion in this intervening cause was
filed. 36 Fed. Rep. 808.
In this opinion the contracts between the car company and
the railway company are held to be fraudulent and void as
to the railway company But the court holds that nevertheless
the car company is entitled to be reasonably compensated for
the use of its cars, without reference, however, to the contracts.
As to what would be a reasonable compensation, the court
holds that "a fair compensation for the use of these
would be such amount as similar cars to be used in the same
manner and upon similar roads would commonly rent for in
the open market."
The court then states the general principles which have
been established by the decisions of this court as to charging
the income of the receivership with the payment of certain
classes of liabilities of the railroad company incurred prior to
the receivership, and their payment from the proceeds of the
sale of the railroad prior to the mortgage indebtedness. It
holds that the six months rule, which is the general rule in the
Seventh Circuit, should govern, and finds the car company
entitled to $8162.99, as the balance due to it for the use of the
cars during the six months prior to the receivership, thus in-

creasing by $6100 the allowance made by the master on this
branch of the case.
As to the claims against the receivership, the court found
that the receiver was chargeable with the rental of 138 cars,
instead of 135, as found by the master,.amounting to $9667,
and with the $14,046.55 paid by the car company for repairs
on these cars. The court also allowed the car company the
rentals claimed for the 56 replevied cars, $12,857.32, though,
as the opinion states, "with great difficulty" It also allowed
the $5650.32 claimed for repairs of the replevied cars. The
total amount found due to the car company was $50,775.52,
and interest at six per cent was allowed on this sum from
June 22, 1885, the date of the filing of the master's report.
On October 9, 1888, the final decree was entered, from
which the complainants in the original foreclosure suit prayed
and were allowed an appeal.
After the entry of the decree, Ransom R. Cable filed a petition, praying that the decree might be opened, and that he
might be made a party defendant thereto and to the intervening cause, for the purpose of prosecuting an appeal therefrom,
or be allowed to prosecute an appeal from said decree in the
names of the complainants in the original cause. This petition
represented that a decree directing the sale of the railroad
property and franchises was rendered January 11, 1877, and
that at this sale under this decree the petitioner had become

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The questions presented by this record for our determination arise out of objections by the appellants to allowances
made by the court below in favor of the Western Car Company, the appellee, and which company was permitted to
intervene in the foreclosure proceedings brought by the appellants against the Peoria and Rock Island Railway Company
The first contested question is as to the propriety of the allowance of the sum of $8162.99 for the use of cars of the Western
Car Company for a period of six months prior to the receivership.
It cannot be said that in no case can indebtedness for necessary supplies, which accrued before the appointment of a
receiver, be allowed priority to the mortgage bonds. It was
held in -Miltenbergerv Logansport Railway, 106 U. S. 286,
311, that "many circumstances may exist which may make it
necessary and indispensable to the business of the road and the
preservation of the property, for the receiver to pay preexisting debts of certain classes, out of the earnings of the receivership, or even the corpus of the property" It is, however,
added that "the discretion to do so should be exercised with
very great care. The payment of such debts stands, przma
facte, on a different basis from the payment of claims arising
under the receivership, while it may be brought within the
principle of the latter by special circumstances. It is easy to
see that the payment of unpaid debts for operating expenses,
accrued within ninety days, due by a railroad company suddenly deprived of the control of its property, due to operatives
in its employ, whose cessation from work simultaneously is to
be deprecated, in the interests both of the property and of the
public, and the payment of limited amounts due to other and
connecting lines of road for materials and repairs, and for unpaid ticket and freight balances, the outcome of indispensable
business relations, when a stoppage of the continuance of such

Opinon of the Court.

business relations would be a probable result, in case of nonpayment, the general consequence involving largely, also, the
interests and accommodation of travel and traffic, may well
place such payments in the category of payments to preserve
the mortgaged property in a large sense, by maintaining the
good will and integrity of the enterprise, and entitle them to
be made a first lien."
This subject received further consideration by this court in
the case of Kneeland v Amerwan -Loan Comrnpay, 136 IU.S.
89, 97, and where it was said "The appointment of a receiver vests in the court no absolute control over the property,
and no general authority to displace vested contract liens.
Because in a few specified and limited cases this court has declared that unsecured claims were entitled to priority over
mortgage debts, an idea seems to have obtained that a court
appointing a receiver acquires power to give such preference
to any general and unsecured claims. It has been assumed
that a court appointing a recemver could rightfully burden the
mortgaged property for the payment of any unsecured indebtedness. Indeed, we are advised that some courts have made
the appointment of a receiver conditional upon the payment
of all unsecured indebtedness in preference to the mortgage
liens sought to be enforced. Can anything be conceived
which more thoroughly destroys the sacredness of contract
obligations 2 One holding a mortgage debt upon a railroad
has the same right to demand and expect of the court respect
for his vested and contracted priority as the holder of a mortgage on a farm or lot. So, when a court appoints a receiver
of railroad property, it has no right to make that receivership
conditional on the payment of other than those few unsecured
claims which, by the rulings of this court, have been declared
to have an equitable priority No one is bound to sell to a
railroad company, or to work for it, and whoever has dealings
with a company when property is mortgaged mu~t be assumed
to have dealt with it on the faith of its personal responsibility,
and not in expectation of subsequently displacing the priority
of the mortgage liens. It is the exception and not the rule
that such priority of liens can be displaced." And, accord-

ingly, all claims for rental of cars prior to the appointment of
the receiver were disallowed.
Tested by the principles asserted in these cases, the claim
for car rental that had accrued prior to the receivership cannot
be maintained, but should have been disallowed.
The case of a corporation for the manufacture and sale of
cars, dealing with a railroad company, whose road is subject
to a mortgage securing outstanding bonds, is very different
from that of workmen and employes, or of those who furnish,
from day to day, supplies necessary for the maintenance of the
railroad. Such a company must be regarded as contracting
upon the responsibility of the railroad company, and not in
reliance upon the interposition of a court of equity
In the present case it appears, in the contract between the
car company and the railroad company, that the former
reserved the express right to terminate the contract and
demand possession of the cars forthwith upon any failure by
the railroad company to promptly pay the interest or the pnncipal of any of its bonds or other liabilities. Such a provision
shows that the car company was aware of the existence of the
outstanding bonds, and protected itself by other methods than
relying upon the possible order of a court which might
appoint a receiver. Moreover, it appears in this case that the
principal officers of the car company were in control df the
railroad company and its operations, and must be treated as
having full notice of the financial condition of the railroad
company, and as having leased the cars to it in reliance upon
its general credit, rather than in expectation of displacing the
priority of the mortgage liens.
The item of $966-7, allowed for a balance of rental of cars
that accrued during the receivership from February 1, 1875,
to the surrender of the cars, appears to us to come fairly
within the doctrine of this court as a proper allowance.
The next contested claim is for $12,857.32, allowed by the
court below for rental of the 56 cars which had been replevied
by the Western Car Company from the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company, and placed in the control of the
receiver of the Peoria and Rock Island Railway Company

THOMAS v. WESTERN CAR COMPANY.
Opinion of the Court.

It is contended by the appellants that these cars were not
necessary for the use of the receiver, and were put in his
custody as a matter of convenience for the car company, and
that, at any rate, the amount charged for their use, and allowed
by the court below, was excessive. They claim that a mileage
charge for the actual use of the cars would be an equitable
allowance. The evidence upon this branch of the case is
conflicting and confusing. The learned judge of the court
below, in his opinion, says: "Looking at all the circumstances,
I am of opinion that the endorsement by the receiver on the
agreement of June 11, 1875, signed by him, that the 56 cars
delivered to him, 'being the cars replevied from the Chicago
and Northwestern Railroad Company,' shall be retained by
him ' upon the same terms set forth' in the above agreement,
'commencing on the first day of December, 1875,' should turn
the scale, and as the terms of the agreement of June 11, 1875,
were not unreasonable, and as the endorsement was one which
the receiver might reasonably have made in the interest of a
fair administration of the property in his hands, I approve the
finding of 812,857.32 as the rental of the replevied cars while
they were under the control of the receiver."
Our conclusion, reached with some difficulty, and after a
careful consideration of the evidence, is to accept the views of
the court below, and to allow this claim.
The next matters of contention are the allowances made by
the court below on account of repairs of the rented cars, being
$14,046.55 for repairs on the 138 cars rented under the agreement of June 11, 1875, and $5650.32 for repairs on the 56
replevied cars.
It should be observed that the sums so allowed were not for
repairs made by the receiver, but for moneys expended by the
car company in rebuilding and repairing the cars after they
were surrendered to the car company by the receiver. By the
contract between the receiver and the car company it was
provided that the former should keep the cars in good repair
for use on the road. Hilliard, the receiver, testified that the
condition of the cars, when he was appointed, was very poor,
and in this he was corroborated by other witnesses. He also

states that when they were delivered up to the car company
they were in as good condition as, and better than, when he
received them. Mozier and Doyle, who were familiar with
their condition when the receiver took possession of them, and
who had made repairs on them while the receiver used them,
testified that the condition of the cars waa better when
delivered up than when they came into the hands of the
receiver
There is, however, testimony on behalf of the car company
to the contrary Our consideration of the conflicting evidence
brings us to the conclusion that the car company is entitled to
an allowance on account of repairs, but not to the amount
awarded by the court below The master reported on this
subject as follows "I have found it difficult to deal with this
branch of the case, for the reason that while it appears that
the bills which have been presented for these repairs were
actually paid by the petitioner, it is also evident that in many
instances these repairs were extravagantly conducted, and that
in many respects they were rendered necessary by their condition before they came into the hands of the receiver. It is
also apparent from the testimony that in many cases cars were
practically rebuilt and renewed." And in respect to the 56
replevied cars he says "'It is apparent from the testimony
that these 'cars were received in bad condition, after having
been used for two or three years by the railroad, from which
they appear to have been taken by the receiver, partly, at
least, upon the suggestion and for the accommodation of the
petitioner."

IHe further reported that he found it impossible from the
testimony to determine to what extent the respondent was
liable for the payment of this charge, and that he was unable
to make what might finally be regarded as an equitable distribution of this liability, and was, therefore, obliged to charge
the respondent with the full amount of the payments shown

to have been made on this account. If, indeed, it was impossible, under the evidence, for the master to discriminate between what was expended to put the cars into running order
for use, as stipulated for in the contract, and the amount

THOMAS v. WESTERN CAR COMPANY.
Opinion of the Court.

expended in rebuilding the cars, it may be that the proper
conclusion would have been to disallow the claims altogether;
However, we are not disposed either to allow the claims for
repairs in full, or to refuse wholly to regard them. We agree
with the court below in thinking that the contract bound the
receiver to keep the cars in good running order, and if he did
not do so, to be charged with what was reasonably expended
by the car company on that behalf after they were surrendered.
Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion
that some allowance is properly chargeable against the receivership on this account.
In fixing the amount of such an allowance we do not find
ourselves wholly left to conjecture. Theodore Mozier, the
master mechanic of the Peoria and Rock Island Railroad
Company, certified that he made an inspection of 138 of these
cars at the time they were surrendered to the car company
by the receiver, and he estimated that the sum of $99-.20
would suffice to put them in fair running order. James Doyle,
who was for some years in the employ of the Peoria and
Rock Island Railway Company, and afterwards in that of the
receiver, in the car shops, assisted Mozier in inspecting these
cars. He states that, in his opinion, the cars were in poor
condition when they came into the hands of the receiver and
were in better condition when surrendered by him. He gave
a detailed statement of repairs put upon these cars while in
possession of the receiver, amounting to $1440. The testimony
on the part of the car company consists chiefly of evidence of
the amounts actually paid for repairs and reconstruction of
the cars after they were surrendered. But it fails -indeed,
show how much of such paydoes not pretend to try -to
ments was due to the original condition of the cars and how
much to the wear and tear while in the hands of the receiver.
It is affirmatively found by the master that, in many instances, the repairs were extravagantly conducted, that in
many cases the cars were practically rebuilt and renewed,
and that in many respects the repairs were rendered necessary
by their condition before they came into the hands of the
receiver.

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

We think it is clear that the object and scope of the repairs
put upon the cars was not merely to put them in running
order, but to renew them, so as to put them in a condition
acceptable to a new lessee. The expenditure for such repairs
is shown to have been about $100 per car, and it was testified
by General Huidekoper, a witness on behalf of the car company, and a person of large experience in such matters, that
the cost of a general overhauling and rebuilding of cars is
from $50 to $80, and that $36 a year for ordinary repairs
and $80 every two years for general repairs would keep the
cars in good order.
Assuming, then, that the proportion of the amount shown
to have been expended in the renewal of these cars was $80
per car, and the rest in ordinary repairs of the kind contemplated by the contract, and deducting from the claims as made
for the entire number of the cars, to wit, $19,695, the estimated
cost of reconstruction, as certified to by Huidekoper, $13,920,
there remains the sum of $5775, representing ordinary repairs,
and to that extent we approve the decree of the court below
in allowing for repairs.
The final matter of contention is the allowance of interest.
We think the court below was plainly right in rejecting the
car company's claim for interest based upon the statute of
Illinois, prescribing interest at the rate of six per cent per
annum for moneys after they become due on "any bond, bill,
promissory note or other instrument of writing." But the
learned judge was of opinion that some allowance of interest
should be made, because of what he deems to have been a vexatious and unreasonable delay in the payment of what was justly
due the car company As against this view of the case it is
urged that the delay was occasioned by resisting demands made
by the car company, which the result of the litigation shows
were excessive, if not extortionate.
We cannot agree that a penalty in the name of interest
should be inflicted upon the owners of the mortgage lien for
resisting claims which we have disallowed. As a general rule,
after property of an insolvent passes into the hands of a receiver or of an assignee in insolvency, interest is not allowed on
