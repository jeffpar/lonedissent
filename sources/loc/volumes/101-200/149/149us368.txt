essential or important for the safety of the public, the security
of passengers and employes, or the protection of the property
of adjoining owners. The imposing of proper penalties for

company to fence its roads and to construct proper cattle
guards, is taking property of the defendant without due process of law, falls with the supposed invalidity of such consequential damages which we hold to be within the discretion of
the legislature to impose.
