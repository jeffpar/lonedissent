OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

"1. No proper bond for appealing said cause to this court
has been given, and none was required by said Circuit Court
to be given, but in allowing this appeal, said court assumed to
excuse and dispense with the bond required by law, whereby
the allowance of appeal is rendered invalid and this court
acquires no jurisdiction thereby
"2. This appeal is not taken and prosecuted by the party
against whom the decree of the court below was rendered.
"3. It is apparent upon an inspection of the record that said
appeal is frivolous and utterly groundless, and was taken for
the purposes of delay merely"

Opinion of the Court.

Railway Company, St. ILouis & San Francisco Railway Company, Southern California Railroad Company Accompanying the motion was the following "Statement "
" May 22, 1889, complaint was filed before the Interstate
Commerce Commission against the appellees by the Board of
Trade of Sal Bernardino, California, alleging said companies'
maintenance of freight rates discriminative against San Bernardino, and in violation of the act of February 4, 1881, to
regulate commerce (24 Stats. 379).
" Upon hearing, order was entered by the Commission on
July 19, 1890, requiring the appellees to change and modify
such rates. The appellees failed to obey such order, whereupon the Interstate Commerce Commission commenced this
proceeding to enforce such obedience in the UT S. Circuit
Court for the Southern District of California, on May 1, 1891,
pursuant to section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act
(amended act of March 3, 1889, 25 Stats. 859). That court
decreed in favor of the appellees on April 25, 1892, on the sole
ground that upon the proof presented the alleged unlawful
discrimination in rates did not exist, (50 Fed. Rep. p. 295,
Trans. p. 202,) and thereupon, on May 14, 1892, (Trans. p.
4163,) the Commission appealed to this court.
"Such decision was rendered and this appeal was taken
after the creation of the Circuit Courts of Appeals. The
question is whether such direct appeal lies to this court."
