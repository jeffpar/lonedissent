WISCONSIN CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY v.
PRICE COUNTY
ERROR TO THE SUPREIME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
No. 76. Argued and submitted November 6, 7, 1889. -Decided

March 3, 1890.

No State has power to tax the property of the United States within its limits.
Where Congress has prescribed conditions upon which portions of the public
domain may be alienated, and has provided that upon the performance
of 'the co4ditions a patent shall issue to the donee or purchaser, and all
such conditions have been complied with and the tract to be alienated
is distinctly defined, and nothing remains but to issue the patent, then
the donee or purchaser is to be treated as the beneficial owner of the
'land, holding it as his own property, subject to state and local taxation;
but when an official executive act, prescribed by law, remains to be done
before the tract can be distinctly defined, and before a patent can issue,
the legal and equitable'titles remain in the United States, and the land
is not subject to local taxation.
[he act of the Secretary of the Interior in approving the selection,of indemnity lands by a railroad land-grant. company, to supply deficiencies
in selections within the place limits, is judicial, and until it is done the
company has no equitable right in the selected tracts; and this rule is
not affected by the fact that such a refusal was given under a mistake
of law, and was subsequently withdrawn, and an assent given.
A mere dictum in an opinion, not essential to the decision, is not authorita.tive and binding.

I kpril, 1884, the plaintiff in this suit, the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, a corporation created under the laws
of Wisconsin, was the owner of certain lands situated in the
town of Worcester, in the county of Price, in that State, and
had a patent for them from the State bearing date on the 25th
of February, 1884, upon -which taxes had, in the year 1883,
been assessed by that county, although, as claimed by the plaintiff, the title to a part of these lands was at that time in the
United States, and to the remainder of them in the State of'
Wisconsin. Upon a claim that the lands were thus exempt
from taxation, the plaintiff, in April, 1884, brought the present suit in a Circuit Court of the State, to obtain its judgment

that the state taxes were illegal, and to-enjoin proceedings.fbi

their enforcement.
The. facts, out of which this claim that the lands were
exempt from' taxation arose, are briefly these; On the 5 th
of May, 1864, Congress passed an act making a grant of lands
to the State of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of three
distinct lines of railway, betw een, certain designated points.
13 Stat. 66, c. 80. One of these lines is now held by the
plaintiff. The grant, in aid of it is in the third section of the
act, the language of which is as follows:
"That there be, and is hereby, granted to the State of
Wisconsin, for the purpose of aiding in-the construction of
a railroad from Portage City, Berlin, Doty's'Island, or Fond
du Lac, as said, State may determine, in a,northwestera direction, to Bayfield, and thence to. Superior, .on Lake, Superior,
every alternate section of public land, designated by odd numbers, for ten sections in width on each side of, said road,. upon
the same terms and conditions as are contained in the act
granting lands to said state, to aid in .the construction of
railroads in said state, approved June three, eighteen, hun-,
dred and fifty-six. But in, case it shall appear that the United
States have, when the -line or- route of said road is definitely
fixed,' sold, reserved, or otherwise disposed of, any sections or
parts thereof, granted as- aforesaid, or, that the right of pre'
emption or homestead has attached to the same, that it shall
be lawful for any agent or agents of said state, appointed by
the governor thereof, to select, subject.to the approval of -the'.
Secretary of the,Interior, from the lands of, the United States
nearest to the.tier of sections above specified, as much public
land in alternate sections, or parts of, sections, as shall be equal
to such lands as the United States have sold or otherwise
appropriated, or to which the right of preemption or homestead has. attached as aforesaid, which lands (thus selected-in

and parts of sections designated by odd numbers as aforesaid,

use and purpose aforesaid : Provided, That the lands to be
so located shall in no case be further than twenty miles from
the line of said road."
The seventh section enacted: "That whenever the companies to which this grant is made, or to which the same may
be transferred shall have completed twenty consecutive miles
of any portion of said railroads, supplied with all necessary
drains, culverts, viaducts, crossings, sidings, bridges, turnouts,
watering places, depots, equipments, furniture, and all other
appurtenances of a first-class railroad, patents shall issue con3eying
the right and title to said lands to the said company
entitled thereto, on each side of the road, so far as the same
is completed and coterminous with said completed section, not
exceeding the amount aforesaid, and patents shall in like manner issue as each twenty miles of said road is completed: Provided, however, That no patents shall issue for any of said
lands unless there shall be presented to the Secretary of
the Interior a statement, verified on oath or affirmation by
the president of said company, and certified by the governor
of the state of Wisconsin, that such twenty miles have been
completed in the manner required by -this act, and setting forth
.with certainty the points where such twenty miles begin and
where the same end; which oath shall be taken before a judge
of a court of record of the United States."
The ninth section declared: "That if said road mentioned
in the third section aforesaid is not completed within ten years
from the time of the passage of this act, as provided herein,
no further patent shall be issued to said company for said
lands, and no further sale shall be made, and the lands unsold
shall revert to the United States."
By the act of Congress of April 9, 1874, the time for the
completion of the road and lor the reversion of the lands was
extended to December 31, 1876. 18 Stat. 28, c. 82.
All the lands embraced by section three of the act of 1864
were granted in 1866 by the State of Wisconsin to the Portage and Lake Superior Railroad Company and to the Winnebago and Superior Railroad Company, respectively, companies
which had been incorporated under the laws of that State.

Statement-of the Case.

'Private and Local Laws of Wisconsin of 1866, c. 314, ยง 8;,
c. 362, ยง 9. In 1869 the consolidation of these two companies,
under the name of the Portage, Winnelago and Superior
Railroad Company, was authoriied by the State, and, in 1871,
the name of the consolidated company was changed to the
Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, the plaintiff in this
suit.

The Portage, Winnebago and Superior Railroad Company
duly filed the location of its road from Stevens' Point to Bayfield on October 7, 1869; and in December following the
Commissioner of the General Land Office withdrew from sale,
preemption and homeitead entry the odd-numbered sections
of land within .the twenty-miles limit dlong the line of the
location. The road was *builtin sections of twenty miles each.
Section six and portions of sections five and seven fell within
Price County. Section five was completed in February, 1874,
section six in December, 1876,' and section seven in June, 1877.
The whole number of acres in the odd-numbered sections
along the line of the railroad within the ten-mile limits was
1,377,383.93. Of this number 789,622 acres had been disposed
of by the United States before the act of May 5, 1864, was
passed, and 161,659.53 were disposed of after its passage and
before the line of the road was located in October, 1869.
The plaintiff, the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company,'
received from the United States, prior to lovember 16, 1877,
patents for the 240,363.54 acres within the place limits, that
is, within ten miles on either side of the line of the road as
located, and patents for 203,459.62 acres within the indemnity
limits, that is, between ten and twenty miles of the line of the
road. On January 9, 1878, the company received from the
United States a patent for 162,622.89 acres, and on August 10,
1878, a patent for 29,398.51-acres, both of these patents covering, land within the place limits. No other patents were
issued by the United States to the company previous to the
commencement of this suit, and the patents issued did not
include the land upon which the taxes were assessed, to restrain the collection of which the suit is brought. Of the
lands in question, eleveniparcels of forty acres each-lay within

the place limits. The remainder of the lands lay within the
indemnity limits. A list of selections of lands within the
place limits claimed by the company on account of the sixth
section of the road from Stevens' Point to Bayfield, was filed
in the local land office on December 5, 1876; they included,
among other lands, the eleven forties mentioned. A list of
selections of land within the indemnity limits claimed by the
dompany on account of the same section of railway, Was filed
in that office on the 9th and 15th of December, 1876; they
included the remainder of the lands referred to in the complaint. Repeated demands were made by the railroad company, from the time these lists were filed until after the trial
of this cause, for patents covering the lands referred to, but
no patents were granted for any of them. -A full statement
of the efforts to secure patents is given in the testimony of the
vice-president and general legal manager of the company.
It appears from this statement, the accuracy of which is not
questioned in any particular, that up to the time of the decision of this court in Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston Ra4road v. United States, 92 U. S. 733 which was rendered in
April, 1876, it had-been the practice of the Land Department
to allow grantees by the United States of land to aid in the
construction of railroads, whose grants were similar in their
,tefims to the one under consideration here, to take land from
the indemnity limits in lieu of lands sold or otherwise disposed
by the United States prior to the passage of the act, and of
lands to which a predmption or homestead right had previously
attached; but that this practice was subsequently changed in
consequence of the language of the court in that case and its
supposed decision that indemnity could be allowed only for
such lands as were sold or reserved or otherwise disposed of, or
to which the right of preemption or -homestead had attached,
between.the passage of'the act and the time the line or route
of the road. was definitely fixed.
The Commissioner of the General Land Office, in a letter
addressed.to the Secretary of the Interior, under date of. November 16, 1877, contained in the record, stated-that this practice had-existed since the-inauguration of -the railroad land

question that the practice was erroneous; that indemnity could
only be allowed for lands sold or disposed of after th passage
of the granting act, and applying that rule to the grant under.
consideration the company had received patents for 41,820.09
acres in excess of the indemnity authorized. The Secretary of
the Interior, in answer to this letter, under date of December
26, 1877, referred to the decision of the Supreme Court, and
held in pursuance of it that lands sold or disposed of by the
United States prior to the passage of the act granting lands to
the State of Wisconsin were exceptedfrom the operation of the
grant, and that indemnity could not be obtained for the lands
thus lost - citing from the opinion of the court to show that
such was its decision. The Secretary concluded by stating that
in accordance with that rule the company had already received
41,820.09 acres in excess of what it was entitled to, and instructed the commissioner to call upon the company to relinquish its claim to that quantity of land, in order that it might
be restored to the public domain. Repeated efforts were afterwards made by the agents of the company to induce the
Secretary of the Interior to change his views upon that point,
but without success. Accordingly, no selections of indemnity
lands for lands lost from the grant within the placre limits.
along the line of the constructed road known as section six'
were ever approved by him, and no patehts of the United States
were issued for such lands, or for any lands within the place
limits along that section, until after this suit was commenced.
Raving failed to secure any patent from the United States,
the plaintiff made application in February, 1884-, to the State
of Wisconsin for a patent, and, on the 25th of that month, a
patent by the State was issued to it embracing the lands mentioned in the complaint. When application was thus made to
the officials of the State, a careful examination was had by
them of the selections in order to determine whether any of
the parcels were swamp lands.
* There was no controversy concerning the facts of the case,
and the trial court found substantially 'as follows:
1. That the lands described in the-complaint were all wild,

unoccupied, and unimproved and situated in the town of Worcester in the county of Price, and were a portion of the lands
granted 'to the State by the third section of the act of Congress of May 5, 1864, for the purpose of constructing what.is
now the plaintiff's railroad.
2. That eleven forties of the land described were situated
within the ten-mile limits of said grant, and all the rest within
the indemnity limits, and all in odd-numbered sections.
8. That all of said lands were assessed in that town in 1883
and put on the tax-roll, and the amount of tax carried out
against each respective piece, but were not assessed to the
plaintiff by name, or to any one else, or to "unknown owners,"
and that none of the real estate included in the assessmentroll for that year was assessed to the owners thereof ; that a
warrant was attached to said tax-roll and the roll, with' said
warrant attached, placed in the hands of the town treasurer
for collection; that the taxes were unpaid thereon, and the
town treasurer returned the same to the county treasurer as
delinquent.
4. That on the 25th of February, 1884, the plaintiff received
a patent from the State for all said lands, and thereby acquired
the absolute title in fee to the same; that until then the
plaintiff cotild get no title to the lands and had no right to
sell or convey the same; that until they were segregated and
identified and the grant applied thereto, the grant was "a
float."
5. That the plaintiff's.right to the lands. was in dispute
between the State and the United States; that said lands and
others were withheld from tle State and the plaintiff by the
Secretary of the' Interior, and thereby the issue of patents
therefor by the United States was delayed; that the plaintiff
did not in'any manner cause the delay, but, on the contrary,
was diligent and persistent in its efforts to procure the patents;
that the delay in their issue was caused entirely by the government of the United States and the General Land Office,
against the protest of both the plaintiff, and the State, and in
spite of continued and unintermitted efforts made by both to
obtain their issue by the Interior Department.

6. That the ]ands described had at the time the taxes wer6
levied and assessed thereon in 1883 been selected as lands"to
which said land grant applied, but said selections had not been
approved by the Secretary of the Interior and had not been
certified to the State, or in any manner identified as lands for.
which the plaintiff would evgntually receive patents, but, on
the contrary, the Secretary of the Interior refused to recognize
the right of the State to the lands or to approve the. selections
made.
As conclusions of law the court found, in effect:
1. That it was not the intent and meaning of 'the act of
Congress that said lands should be subject to taxation until
they had been earned by the plaintiff and patented by the
United States; that while they had been in truth earned bythe plaintiff before they were assessed for taxation, yet the
plaintiff's right to the same and to patents therefor had been
denied by the Secretary of the Interior; that the plaintiff
could not exercise control over them until it should be determined whether it was entitled to receive patents for them as
part of the lands granted.
2. That the lands were "a float" as long as the pliintiff's
right thereto was not admitted and recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, but denied and disputed by him and.
patents therefor withheld by him against the will and request
of the plaintiff, and hence during such time the lands were
not subject to taxation by the State.
3. That said lands were not subject to taxation in 1883, and
that the taxes levied and assessed thereon for that year were
illegal and- void for the reason that said lands were then exempt from taxation.
4. That said tax was a cloud upon the plaintiff's title to
said lands, and it was, therefore, entitled to the relief prayed
for in the complaint.
Upon these findings judgment in favor of the plaintiff perpetually restraining the defendants from collecting said taxes
was entered. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court
of the State, by which the judgment below was reversed; and
the cause remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to.

Mr. Willis Hand, -Mr. Xt. Barry and Mrf. John C. Spooner,

Mr. JusTicn FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

It is familiar law that a State has no power to tax the property of the United States within its limits. This exemption of
their property from state taxation - and by state taxation
we mean any taxation by authority of the State, whether it
be strictly for state purposes or for mere local and special
objects-is founded upon that principle which inheres in
every independent government, that it must be free from any
such interference of another government as may tend to destroy its powers or impair their efficiency. If the property of
the United States could be subjected to taxation by the State,
the object and extent of the taxation would be subject to the
State's discretion. It might extend to buildings and other
property essential to the discharge of the ordinary business of
the national government, and in the enforcement of the tax
those buildings might be taken from the possession and use of
the United States. The Constitution vests in Congress the
power to "dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory'or other property belonging to
the United States." And this implies an exclusion of all
other authority over the property which could interfere with
this right or obstruct its exercise. 'an Brocklin v. State of
Tennessee, 1171 U. S. 151, 168.
This doctrine of exemption from taxation of the property of
the United States, so far as lands are concerned, is in express

tIerms. affirmed in the constitution of Wisconsin, which ordains
that the State- shall never interfere with the primary disposition of the soil, within the same by the United States, nor
with any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing
the title in such soil to bona f&d purchasers thereof; and no
tax shall be imposed on land the property of the United States."
Constitution of 1848, Art. I, sec. 2.
It follows that all the public domain of the United States
within the State of Wisconsin was in 1883 exempt from state
taxation. Usually the possession of the legal title by the
government determines both the fact and the right of ownership. There is, however, an exception to this doctrine with
respect to the public domain, which is as well settled as the
doctrine itself, and that is, that where Congress has prescribed
the conditions upon which portions of that domain may be
alienated, and provided that upon the performance of the
conditions a patent of the United States shall issue to the
donee or purchaser, and all such conditions are complied with,
the land alienated being distinctly defined, it only remaining
for the government to issue its patent, and until such issue
holding the legal title in trust for him, who in the meantime
is not excluded from the use of the property -in other words,
when the government has ceased to hold any such right or
interest in the property as to justify it in withholding a patent
from the donee or purchaser, and it does not exclude him from
the use of the property- then the donee or purchaser will be
treated as the beneficial owner of the land, and the same be
held subject to taxation as his property. This exception to
the general doctrine is founded upon the principle that he who
has the right to property, and is not excluded from its enjoyment, shall not be permitted to use the legal title of the
government to avoid his just share of state taxation.
Thus, in Carrollv. ,Saford,3 How. 441, 461, the complainant had entered certain lands belonging to the United States,
in the local land office, paid for them the required price, and
received from the office a land certificate. Patent' were
issued for them, but, before their issue, the lands were assessed
for taxation and sold for the taxes. The question whether

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

they were subject to taxation by the State after their entry
and before the patents were issued was answered in the
affirmative. Said the court: "When the land was purchased
and paid for, it was no longer the property of the United
States, but of the purchaser. He held for it a final certificate,
which could no more be cancelled by the United States than a
patent;" and again: "It is said the fee is not in the purchaser, but in the United States, until the patent shall be
issued. This is so, techiiically, at law, but not in equity. The
land in the hands of the purchaser is real estate, descends to
his heirs, and does not go to his executors or administrators."
And again: "1Lands which have been sold by the United
States can in no sense be called the property of the United
States. They are no more the property of the United States
than lands patented. So far as the rights of the purchaser are
considered, they are protected under the patent certificate as
fully as under the patent. Suppose the officers of the government had sold a tract of land, received the purchase money,
and issued a patent certificate: can it be contended that they
could sell it again, and convey a good title? They could no
more do this than they could sell land a second time which
had been previously patented. When sold, the government,
until the patent shall issue, holds the mere legal title for the
land in trust for the purchaser; and any second purchaser
would take the land charged with the trust."
In Witehrspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 218, a similar question arose and was in like manner answered. Said the court:
"In no just sense can lands be said to be public lands after
they have been entered at the land office and a certificate of
entry obtained. If public lands before the entry, after it they
are private property. If subject to sale, the government has
no power to revoke the entry and withhold the patent. A
second sale, if the first was authorized by law, confers no
right on the buyer, and is a void act,;" and again: "The contract of purchase is complete when the certificate of entry is
executed and delivered, and thereafter the land ceases to be a
part of the public domain. The government agrees to make
proper conveyance as soon as it'-can1. and in the meantime

WISCOINSIN RAILROAD O. v. PRICE COUNTY. 507
Opinion of the Court.

holds the naked legal fee in trust for the purchaser, who has
the equitable title." See, also, Railway Co. v. Prescott, 16
Wall. 603, 608; Railway Co. v. AcShane, 22 Wall. 444, 461.
In the light of these decisions,,it will be necessary, in order
to determine the liability of the property held by the plaintiff
to taxation in 1883, to consider the nature and extent of its
interest in the property at that time acquired under the grant
of Congress of May, 1864, and by its subsequent construction
of the road.
Numerous grants of land were made by Congress between
1860 and 1880 to aid in the construction of railroad; some
directly to incorporated companieg, others to different States,
the lands to be by them transferred to companies by whom
the construction of the roads might be undertaken. The
different acts making these 'grants were similar in their general provisions, and so many of them have been, at different
times, before this court for consideration that little can be
said of their puiport and meaning, the title they transfer, and
the conditions upon which the lands could be used and disposed of, which has not already and repeatedly been said in
its decisions. Each grant gave a specified quantity of lands,
designated by sections along 'the route of the proposed road,
with the exception of such as might, when the line of the
road should be definitely fixed, have been disposed. of or
reserved by the government, or to which a preemption or
homestead right might then have attached. For these excepted sections, which otherwise would have been taken from
those designated along the line of the road, other laiids beyond
those sections within a specified distance were allowed to be
selected. The title cohferred was a present one, so as to insire
the donation for the construction of the road proposed agai1Tt
any revocation by Congress, except for non-performance of the
,work within the period designated, accompanied, however, with
such restrictions upon the use and disposal of the lands askto
prevent their diversion from the purposes of the grant. It was
the practice of the Land Department, as shown by the evidence
in this Pecord, up to the decision of Leavenworth, Lawrence &
Galveston RailroadCo. v. United States, in April, 1876, 92 U. S.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

733, to allow deficiencies in the quantity of land intended to be
granted, arising from sales or other disposition made before the
date of the grant, as well as those made subsequently, and those
arising from the attachment of preemption or homestead rights,
to be supplied from lands lying beyond the "original sections,
within what were termed the indemnity limits. This practice
was held in Winona & St. Peter RailroadCo. v. Barney to have
been correct. 113 U. S. 618, 625. As the court there said: "The
policy of the government was to keep the public lands open at
all times to sale and preemption, and thus encourage the settlement of the country, and, at the same time, to advance such
settlement by liberal donations to aid in the construction of
railways. The acts of Congress, in effect, said: 'We give to the
State certain lands to aid in the construction of railways lying
along their respective routes, provided they are not already
disposed of, or the rights of settlers under the laws of the United
States have not already attached to them, or they may not be
disposed of or such rights may not have attached when the
routes are finally determined. If at that time it be found that
of the lands designated any have been disposed of, or rights of
settlers have attached to them, other equivalent lands may be
selected in their place, within certain prescribed limits.' The
encouragement to settlement by aid for the construction of
railways was not intended to interfere with the policy of
encouraging such settlement by sales of the land, or the grant
of preemption rights." The court accordingly held that the
indemnity clause covered losses from the grant by reason of
sales and the attachment of preemption rights previous to the
date of the act, as well as by reason of sales and the attachment of preiemption rights between that date and the final
determination of the route of the road.
After the decision of the court in the Leavenworth case the
Land Department changed its practice and refused to allow the
deficiencies, arising from sales or other disposition made, orfrom the attachment of preemption or homestead rights before
the date of the act, to be made up from selections within the
indemnity limits. But that decision did not warrant the
change.' The question in that casq was not, for what deficien-

WISCONSIN RAILROAD CO v. PRICE COUNTY. 509
Opinion of the Court.

cies indemnity could be had, but what lands could be taken
for deficiencies which existed. If what was then said indicated that deficiencies which could be supplied were limited to
such as might arise after the passage of the act, it was a mere
dictum not essential to the decision, and therefore not authori
tative and binding. The refusal of the Land Department,
therefore, to allow the deficiencies arising in the sections
within the place limits in this case to be supplied by selectiofis
from the indemnity lands, and to issue patents of the United
States for them, was erroneous.
The question now arises as to how far this refusal affected
the legal or equitable title of the company to the lands taxed
in 1883, for which it only obtained a patent in 1884. The
lands' taxed amounted to eleven parcels of forty acres each
lying within the original sections named in the grant, that is,
within the ten miles limit from the line of the road, and the
remainder were. within the indemnity limits. Neither. were
allowed, because, by excluding the deficiencies arising before
the date of the grant from. indemnity, the whole amount of
the lands granted had already-been' patented. So far as the
eleven parcels of forty acres each are concerned, the right of
the plaintiff to them and, to a patent for them had as early as,
1877 become complete under the terms of the granting act.
The line of the railroad had been definitely fixed on the 7th
of October, 1869 ; and the three twenty-mile sections, numbers
five, six, and seven, were all completed- in June, 1877, and
supplied with tl~e buildings and appurtenances specified in the
act to entitle the company to patents for them from the United
States. The title conferred by- the grant was necessaril \ an
imperfect one; because, until the lands were identified by' the
definite location of the road, it could not be known wl~t
specific lands would be embraced i the sections named. The
grant was, therefore, until such location, a float. -But when
the route of the road was definitely fixed, the sections granted
became susceptible of identificatieni and the title attached to
them and took effect as of the date of the grant, so as to cut
off all intervening claims. Schulenberg.v. H~arriman,.21 Wall.

733, 741; Xfissour, .ansas 8
-Yansas Pacific Railway, Co., 97 U. S. 491, 496; Railway
Co. v. Baldwin, 103 U. S. 426, 429. The road having been
built as early as June, 1877, and supplied, as required, with
the appurtenances specified, the company wa entitled to have
the restrictions upon the use of the land released. It had
then, to the eleven forty-acre parcels which were capable of
identification,- an indefeasible right or title; it matters" not
which term be used. Thesubsequent issue of the patents by the
United States was not essential. to the right of the company
to those parcels, although in many respects they would have
been of great service .to it. They would have served to
identify the lands as coterminous with the road completed;
they would have been evidence that the grantee had complied
with the conditions of the grant, and to that extent that the
grant was relieved of possibility of forfeiture for breach of
them; they would have obviated the necessity of any other
evidence of the grantee's right to the lands; and they would
have been evidence that the lands were subject to the disposal
of the railroad company with the consent of the government.
They would have been in these respects deeds of further
assurance of the patentee's title, and, therefore, a source of
quiet and peace to it in its possessions.
There are many instances in the reports where such effect as
is here stated has been given to patents authorized or directed
to be issued to parties, notwithstanding they had previously
received a legislative grant of the premises, or their title had
been already confirmed. In Langdeau v. ..anes, 21 Wall.
521, 529, we have one of that kind. There, this court said:
"In the legislation of Congress a patent has a double operation. It is a conveyance by the government, when the government has any interest to convey; but where it is issued
upon the confirmation of a claim of a previously existing title,
it is documentary evidence, having the dignity of a record, of
the existence of that title, or of such equities respecting the
claim as justify its recognition and confirmation. The instrument is not the less efficacious as evidence of previously existing rights because it also, embodies words of release or transfer

from the government." We are of opinion, therefore, that
these eleven forty-acre parcels were in 1883 subject to taxation
by the State of Wisconsin. The lands had become the property of the railroad company, and there was nothing to hinder
their use and enjoyment. For that purpose it is immaterial
whether it be held that the company then had a legal and
indefeasible title to -the lands, or merely an equitable title to
them to be subsequently perfected by patents from the govern-.
ment.
But as to the remainder,of the lands taxed, which fell within
the indemnity limits, the case is different. For such lands no
title could pass to the company not. only until the selections
were made by the agents of the State appointed by the governor, but until such selections were approved by the Secretary
of the Interior. The agent of the State made the selecions,
and they had been properly authenticated and forwarded to
the Secretary of the Interior. But that officer never approved
of them. Nor can such approval be inferred from his not formally rejecting them. He refused, as already stated, to issue
to the company any patents for any more lands, insisting that
it"
had already received over 40,000 acres too much, and he
directed the Commissioner of the General Land Office to
require the company to restore this excess to the governient.
The approval of the Secretary was essential to the efficacy of
the selections, and to give to the company any title to the
lands selected. His action in that matter was not ministerial
but judicial. He was required to determine, in the first place,
whether there were any deficiencies in the land granted to the
company which were to be supplied from indemnity landg;
and, in the second place, whether the particular indemnity
lands selected could be properly taken for those deficiencies.
In order to reach a proper conclusion on these two questions
he had also to inquire and determine whether any lands in the
place limits had been previously disposed of by the -government, or whether any preemption or homestead rights had
attached before the line, of the road was definitely fixed.
There could be no indemnity unless a loss was establishecq.
And in determining whether a particular selection could be

taken as indemnity for the losses sustained, he was obliged to
inquire into the condition of those indemnity lands, and determine whether or not any portion of them had been appropriated for any other purpose, and if so, what portion had been
thus appropriated, and what portion still remained. This
action of the Secretary was required, not merely as supervisory of the action of the agent of the State, but for the protection of the United States against an improper appropriation
of their lands. Until the selections were approved there were
no selections in fact, only preliminary proceedings taken for
that purpose; and the indemnity lands remained unaffected in
their title. Until then, the lands which might be taken as
indemnity were incapable of identification ; the proposed selections remained the property of the United States. The gov,ernment was, indeed, under a promise to give the company
indemnity lands in lieu of what might be lost by the causes
mentioned. But such promise passed no title, and, until it was
executed, created no legal interest which could be enforced in
the courts. The doctrine, that until selection made no title
vests in any indemnity lands, has been recognized in several
decisions of this court. Thus in Ryan v. RailroadCo., 99 U. S.
382, 386, in considering a grant of land by Congress, in aid of
the construction of a railroad, similar in its general features to
the one in this case, the court said: "Under this statute, when
the road was located and the maps were made, the right of the
company to the odd sections first named became ipso facto
fixed and absolute. With respect to the Ilieu lands,' as they
are called, the right was only a float, and attached to no specific tracts until the selection was actually made in the manner
prescribed." And again, speaking of a deficiency in the land
granted, :itsaid: "It was within the secondary or indemnity
territory where that deficiency was to be supplied. The railroad company had not and could not have any claim to it
until specially selected, as it was, for that purpose." The
selection had been approved by the Secretary.
In St. Paul &c.Railroadv. Winona &c. Railroad,112 U. S.
'720, 731, the court, speaking of a previous decision, said: "The
reason of this is that, as no vested right can attach to the lands

in place -the odd-numbered sections within sik miles of each
side of the road -. until these sections are ascertained and
identified by a-legal location of the line of the road, so in.
regard to the lands to b.e selected within a still larcer limit,
their identification cannot be known until the selection' is
made. It may be a long time after the line of the road is
located before it is ascertained how many .sections, or parts of
sections, within the primary limits have been lost by sale or
preemption. It may be still longer before a selection is made
to supply this loss."
In Sioux City &c. Railroad v. Uhicago &c. Railway, 117
U. S. 406, 408, where the railroad grant as-to indemnity lands
was substantially similar to the one in this case, and one of
the questions was as to the title to the indemnity lands, the
court said: "No title to indemnity lands was vested until a
selection was made by which they were pointed out and- ascertained, and the selection made approved by the Secretary of
the Interior."
In Barney v. linona &c. Railroad,117 U. S. 228, 232, the
court said: "In- the construction of land-grant acts, in aid
of railroads, there is a well-established distinction observed
between ' granted lands' and ' indemnity lands.' The former
are those falling within the limits specially designated, and
the title to Which attaches when the lands are located by an
approved and accepted survey of the line of the road filed in
the Land Department, as of the date of the act of Congress.
The latter are those lands selected in lieu of parcels lost by
previous disposition or reservation for other purposes, and the
title to which adcrues only from the time of their selection."
The same view has been held by different Attorneys General,
of the United States, in'their official communications to heads
of the departments, where selections of the public lands have
been, granted, subject to the'approval of the Secretary of the
Interior, Cape .MendocinoLighthouse Site, 14 Opinions Attys.
Gen. 50, PortageLand Grant, Ib. 645, and such has been the
consistent practise of the Land Department. The uniform language is, that no title to indemnity lands becomes vested in
any company or in the State until the selections are made;
