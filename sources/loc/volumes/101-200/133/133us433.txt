The case is not open to the objection that the plaintiff
endeavored to extend and 'enlarge by parol the provisions of a
written instrument under the guise of proving its considera-,
tion; and the cases on that subject do not apply.
Although the instrument in question states that the defendants have agreed to receive from the plaintiff, an assignment.
of the plaintiff's contract with the railroad 'company "in trUst
for said company;" that the defendants "assume said contract in their capacities aforesaid;" that they have paid, the
$15,000 "in their capacity aforesaid," and the assignment ig
inade to them "as aforesaid;" and that the plaintiff'"appoints
them, "trustees as aforesaid," his attorneys; and although
they "as aforesaid accept the assignment," their agreement to
save the plaintiff harmless from any and all liability by reasbr
of the contracts named is an 'absolute personal agreement on
their part.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the

On June 14, 1887, the Fidelity National Bank of Cincinnati drew-a draft for
$100,000 on the Chemical National Bank of New York City, payable to
the order of the American Exchange National Bank of Clicago, and put
it into the hands of one W., who delivered it for value to K. & Co. They
endorsed it 'for deposit to their accouilt in the Chicago Bank, which
credited its amount to them and paid their checks against it. It was not paid: Held, that the draft' w.as 'a foreign bill of exchange; that W. did
not act as the agent of the Cincinnati Bank; and that in a suit by the ChiVOL. cxxx-28

cago -Bank against the receiver of the Cincinnati Bank, which had failed,
to recover the amount of the draft, the Chicago Bank was a bona fide
holder and owner of it for value, and want of consideration could not be
shown by the receiver.
The fact that the draft was payable to the order of the plaintiff was not
notice to it that W. was not its purchaser or remitter; and the Cincinnati
Bank had represented to the plaintiff that W. was a bona fide holder of
the draft, for his use in making good trades of his with K. & Co.
An instrument signed by the Cincinnati Bank, dated June 14, 1887, addressed
to the Chicago Bank, stating that W. & Co. had deposited $200,000 to
the credit of the latter bank, for the use of K. & Co., was put by the
former bank into the hands of W. & Co., who delivered it to K. & Co.,
who deposited it with the Chicago Bank, which gave credit for its amount
to K. & Co. as cash, and paid with a part of it an overdraft of K. & Co.
and honored their checks against the rest of it. In a suit by the Chicago
Bank against the said receiver to recover the $200,000: Held, that the
instrument was in its legal character a certificate of deposit; that the
plaintiff was an innocent purchaser of it, for value; that, as the Cincinnati Bank had represented to the plaintiff that it had received from W. &
Co. consideration for the paper, it was estopped fromA setting up the
falsity of such representation; that the plaintiff did not take the paper
under such circumstances as would put a man of ordinary prudence on
inquiry; and that there was nothing to lead the plaintiff to suspect that
the money represented by the paper was that of the Cincinnati Bank.
A defence set up to the suit on the certificate of deposit was, that H. (the
vice-president of the Cincinnati Bank), its assistant cashier, and W.,
of W. & Co., conspired to defraud that bank by using its funds in specuJating in wheat in Chicago, through K. & Co., so as to make a " corner"
in wheat: Held, that rumors on the board of trade and in the public press
that H. was the real principal for whom W. was acting, could not affect
the plaintiff; and that the plaintiff could not refuse to honor the checks
of K. & Co. against the deposit, on the ground that K. & Co. intended to
use the money to pay antecedent losses in the gambling wheat transactions.
The statute of Illinois, I Starr & Curtis, Stat. 1885, pp. 791, 792, §§ 130, 131,
and the case of -Pearce v. Foote, 113 Illinois, 228, do not apply to the
present case.
Where losses have been made in an illegal transaction, a person who lends
money to the loser, with which to pay the debt, can recover the loan, notwithstanding his knowledge of the fact that the money was to be so used.
An obligation will be enforced, though indirectly connected with an illegal
transaction, if it is supported by an independent consideration, so that
the plaintiff does not require the aid of the illegal transaction to make
out his case.
It does not appear that the plaintiff had knowledge or notice that the paper
in suit was delivered to it to be used through it by K. & Co. in connection
with an attempt to corner the market.

delivered the opinion of the court.

These are appeals by David Armstrong, receiver of the
Fidelity National Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio, from decrees rendered against him by the Circuit Court of the. United States
for the Southern District of Ohio, in two suits in equity,
brought against him in that court by the American Exchange
lational Bank of Chicago, Illinois. The first case will be
referred to as No. 1110, and the second case as No 1111.
No. 1110 was commenced on the 5th of November, 1887,
by a petition, which was demurred to by the defendant. -The
demurrer was overruled, the defendant answered the petition,
and there was a replication to the answer.. Then. bv leave of

Opinion of the Court.

the court, a bill in equity was filed in place of the petition.
The bill sets forth the following-facts :The plaintiff is a corpogration under the laws of the United States, doing a general banking business in Ohicago, Illinois. The defendant is the receiver
of the Fidelity National Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio, a corpora
tion created under the laws of the United States, which did a;
general banking business in Cincinnati, Ohio. On the 15th
of June, 1887, the plaintiff became the owner and holder of a
draft drawn by the Fidelity Bank on the Chemical Natfonal
Bank of the city of New York, a copy of which, with all
credits and endorsements thereon, is as follows:
"The Fidelity National Bank.
CiNconNATI, June 14, 1887. No. 16,412.
"$100,000.00.
"Pay to the order of American Exch'ge Nat. B']I, Chicagb,

"Bn9. E. Horxms,.

"To the Chemical National Bank, New York City."

Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago,, 15 June, 1887. A. L. Dewar, cash."
-At the time the draft was drawn, Benjamin E. Hopkins was
the assistant cashier of the Fidelity Bank,.and by its authority
the signature, "Benjamin. E. Hopkins, A-s. Cas.," was used
for the signature of that bank. Within a reasonable time
after the plaintiff became the owner of the draft, to wit, Qn
June 17, 1887, it was presented to the drawee for payment,
which was refused. It was protested for non-payment, 'and
notice of the demand, refusal, and protest was forthwith given
to the Fidelity Bank; anid thereupon that bank became Iliable
to -the -plaintiff in the suim- of '$100,000, with interest from
June 17; 1887.- After the draft was drawn and the plaintiff
had become its oiVner, the Fidelity Bank, without- the knowl-

Opinion of the Court.

edge of the plaintiff, ordered the drawee not to pay the draft;
and the drawee, in refusing to pay it, was acting in accordance
with such instructions. On the 27th of June, 1887, the
Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, acting
under the statute, appointed the defendant receiver of the
Fidelity Bank. On the 12th of July, 1887, a decree was
Tendered by the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Western Division of the Southern District of Ohio, in a proceeding instituted by such Comptroller against the Fidelity
Bank, adjudging that its franchises had been forfeited and
declaring it to be dissolved. In September, 1887, the claim of
the plaintiff was presented to the receiver in due form, but
he rejected it.
The prayet of. the bill is for a decree that such claim for
$100,000, with interest from June 17, 1887, to June 27, 1887,
is a valid claim against the estate in the hands of the defendant as receiver, and that he be directed to satisfy it by paying
dividends upon it from' the assets of the Fidelity Bank; and
for general relief.
The' defendant answered the petition, and, after the bill was
filed, it was ordered that such answer stand for an answer to
the bill, and that the replication which had been filed to it
stand also.
The defence set up in the answer is that the plaintiff is not
the owner of the draft; that it was signed by Hopkins, and
canri6&nto the possession of the plaintiff, without any consideration paid for it by the plaintiff to the Fidelity Bank; and
that that bank never received any consideration from any
person for it, and is not indebted to the plaintiff on account
of it.
It was admitted of record that the draft was prdsented to
the drawee within the reasonable time allowed by law, that
payment was refused, that it was protested for non-payment
and that notice of demand, refusal, and protest was given in
due tine to the Fidelity Bank; and also that the defendant,
on October 31, 1887, declared, and has paid, a dividend of 25
per cent on all -clairas against the Fidelity Bank and the
receiver, approved or adjudicated as valid claims.

ARMSTRONG v. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK. 439'
Opinion of the Court.

Besides cases Nos. 1110 and 1111, a third suit was brought,
and testimony was taken in all three of them at the same
time. It was stipulated of record that all -depositions taken
or to be taken in any one of the three cases might be read
by either party in all of them.
After a hearing on pleadings and proofs, .a decree .was
entered on the 3d of December, 1888, in No. 1110, setting
forth that, on the 15th of June, 1881, the plaintiff became
and had ever since been the owner of the draft in question;
that it was duly presented to the drawee and payment refused,
and the Fidelity Bank had due notice; that the claim was
duly presented to the receiver and rejected; that it is a just
and valid claim, and should have been allowed by him; that
the plaintiff is a bona ftde holder of the draft for a valuable
consideration before maturity, without notice of any want of
consideration, free from all equities or defences whatsoever;
and directing the defendant to allow the claim as one for
the full amount of $100,000 against the assets in his -hands
as..receiver, to satisfy it by.paying such dividends as had.
been made theretofore and as should be made thereafter
from the assets of the Fidelity Bank in'due course of administration, and to pay the dividend of 25 per dent already
declared October 31, 1887, with interest from that date until
the date of payment, and also the costs of the suit. From
that decree the defendant has appealed.
No. 1111 was commenced by a petition filed on the 5th of
November, 1887, which was .demurred to and the demurrer
was overruled. The defendant then answered the petition;. a,
replication was filed to the answer, and then leave was granted
to the plaintiff to file a bill in equity instead of the, petition.
That bill sets forth as follows, in addition to the same formal
matters set forth in the bill in No.. 1110 : On the 14th of June,
1887, the Fidelity Bank issued a certificate of deposit, or letter
of advice, addressed to the plaintiff, of which the following is
a copy:

OCTOBER TERMI, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

"Briggs Swift, president; E. L. Harper, vice-president; Ammi
Baldwin, cashier; Benj. E. Hopkins, ass't cashier.
"U. S. depository. The Fidelity National Bank. Capital,
$2,000,000.00; surplus, $400,000.00.
"CrOINNATI, June 14th, 1887.
"The American Exchange National Bank, Chicago, Illinois.
"Gentlemen: Messrs. Wilshire, Eckert & Co. have deposited
two hundred thousand ($200,000.00) dollars to your credit for
the use of C. J. Kershaw & Co.
"Respectfully yours,
BFNJ. E. HoPxINs, As. Cas."

"At the time this certificate of deposit was issued, Benjamin E.
Hopkins was the assistant cashier of the Fidelity Bank, and
.his signature, "Benj. E. Hopkins, As. Cas.," was used as the
signature of that bank. The certificate was delivered by it to
the plaintiff on the 15th of June, 1887, and the plaintiff has
owned it ever since. On the faith thereof, the plaintiff, at the
request of said 0. J. Kershaw & Co., on said 15th of June,
paid to said C. J. Kershaw & Co., and upon their orders, the
full amount of $200,000, and by means thereof became entitled
. to recover from the Fidelity Bank the full amount of the certifipate. On June 18, 1887, the plaintiff presented the certificate to the Fidelity Bank, at its banking office in Cincinnati,
and demanded payment thereof, which was refused. The
plaintiff became indebted to the Fidelity Bank in the sum of
$1302.77, for a balance on general account. After deducting
such balance, there was due from the latter to the plaintiff, at
the time of such demand, $198,697.23, which amount is still
due, with interest from June 18, 1887. In September, 1887,
that claim was presented to the defendant for allowance, but
he rejected it.
The prayer of the bill is for a decree that the claim, amounting to $198,697.23, with. interest from June 18, 1887, to June
27, 1887, is a valid claim, against the assets in the hands of the
defendant as receiver, and that he be directed to satisfy it by
paying dividends upon it from the assets of the Fidelity Bank
in due course of administration..

ARMSTRONG v. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK.

441

Opinion of the Court.

The answer to the petition and the replication thereto were
ordered to stand in respect to the bill, and like stipulations
were made as in case No. 1110.
The defence set up in the answer is as follows: One Joseph
Wilshire was a member of the firm of Wilshire, Eckert & Co.
E. L. Harper, Benjamin E. Hopkins (the assistant cashier of
the Fidelity Bank) and Wilshire conspired to defraud the
Fidelity Bank. Harper,, Hopkins and Wilshire, with other
persons, were, at and before the 14th of June, 1887, engaged
in what is called "1a deal" in wheat, Which is speculating in '
wheat, in Chicago, by buying very. large amQunts of wheat
on paying a margin or percentage of the purchase price, and
entering into, contracts for future delivery to them of wheat in
lUrge quantities, upon which- contracts they were advancing
and paving a margin or part of the price of the wheat. The
object of the speculation and purchase under the contracts was
to enable said parties to own and -control all the wheat then in
Chicago or to arrive within the time of the performance of the
contracts, and thereby to create what is called a "corner " in
the market; that is to say, by contracting for the purchase and
delivery of more wheat than exists and can by any possibility
be delivered, to create a fictitious value or price therefor, effect
an advance in the market price of wheat in Chicago, and realize a profit thereon to Harper, Hopkins and Wilshire, and such
other persons as. might be engaged with them in the speculation. Harper, Hopkins and Wilshire conspired together unlawfully to abstract from the Fidelity Bank its money and to
embezzle its funds in the possession or control of Harper and
Hopkins as its officers, and, by. drawing bills of exchange and
other evidences of indebtednessin the name of the bank, to uge
its credit and resources for their own benefit, not in the pros_.
cution of its legitimate business, but in the purchase of- wheat:
in Chicago and contracts for the future delivery of wheat, in
the prosecution of said unlawful speculation. The letter of'
advice addressed to the plaintiff, set forth in the bill, was sighil
by Hopkins and delivered by Harper to Wilshire, in the execution of the scheme to abstract the funds of the hank and unlawfully use its credit in the speculation in wheat, and for no

Opinion of the Court.

other purpose. Wilshire, Eckert & Co. did not deposit any
part of the $200,000 mentioned in the letter of advice, in the
Fidelity Bank, to the credit of the plaintiff, for the use therein
expressed. The letter was unlawfully and fraudulently addressed to the plaintiff, when in fact no money had been deposited by any person to the credit of the plaintiff with the
Fidelity Bank, and in the execution of said scheme. At the
time of the alleged delivery of the letter of advice to the
plaintiff, it had notice that Harper, Hopkins and Wilshire
were engaged in said speculation, and were using the credit
and funds of the Fidelity Bank unlawfully for such purpose,
and that the letter of advice was written and signed for such
purpose, and delivered to Wilshire and by him to the plaintiff,
to be used by and through the plaintiff, and by C. J. Kershaw
& Co., who were, and to the plaintiff were well known to be,
brokers, in the purchase of wheat for the account of Wilshire
and his confederates, and had full knowledge that the purchases were in the execution of an unlawful combination to
control the market for wheat and thereby enhance the value
thereof in Chicago. The terms of the agreement between
Wilshire, representing the firm of Wilshire, Eckert & Co., and
his confederates, and the circumstances connected therewith,
were such that the plaintiff was put upon inquiry, and could
not and did not bonaXde make advances to C. J. Kershaw &
Co., nor become entitled to receive from the Fidelity Bank any
part of the amount of such advances, and, if made by the
plaintiff, they were not made in the regular course of business,
but in bad faith and with such notice. The Fidelity Bank did
not become indebted to the plaintiff in any amount, and the
claim is not a valid one and ought not to be allowed.
On the 3d of December, 1888, after a hearing on pleadings
and proofs, a decree was made setting forth that, on the 15th
of June, 1887, the plaintiff became the owner of the certificate
of deposit or letter of advice set out in the bill ; that, on the
faith thereof, and without notice of the matters set forth in
the answer, the plaintiff, on the 15th of June, 1887, advanced
to C. J-. Kershaw & Co. the full amount of $200,000, and by
reason thereof then became entitled to recover from the Fidel.

Opinion of the Court.

ity Bank'the full amount of the certificate; that, on the 18th
of June, 1887, the plaintiff presented the certificate to the
Fidelity Bank and demanded payment thereof, which was refused; that, after the Fidelity Bank became indebted to the
plaintiff in said sum of $200,000, the plaintiff became indebted
to the Fidelity Bank, in the sum of $1302.77V, being a balance
due on general account; that, after ded--ing such balance,
there was due from the Fidelity Bank, at the time of such demand, $198,697.23; that the claim therefor was presented to
the defendant and rejected; and-that the plaintiff is a bonafide
holder of the certificate, for valuable consideration, without
notice of any want of consideration, afid free from any equities
or defences whatsoever. The decree adjudges that the claim
is a valid claim for $198,697.23 against the assets in the hands
of the defendant as receiver, and directs him to satisfy the
same by paying thereon such dividends as had been made theretofore, and should be made thereafter, from the assets of the
Fidelity Bank, inrdue course of administration, and to pay the
dividend of 25 per cent already declared, October 31, 1887;
with interest from that date until the time of 'payment, and
also the costs of the proceeding. From this decree the defendant has appealed.
Case No. 1110 will be first considered. The receiver contends
that the draft is not a valid claim against the funds in his
hands; that there was no endorsement of it by the plaintiff,
which was the payee, to a bonafte holder; that the draft came
into the possession of the plaintiff without any consideration
being paid therefor by it to the Fidelity Bank, and that bank
never received any consideration from any person for it; anq
that the plaintiff does not occupy the position of an endorsee
of it for value.
The facts in evidence, as we understand them, are these: The
draft numbered 16,412 was deposited with the plaintiff by one
of its regular customers, 0.J. Kershaw & Co., 6n June .15, 1887,
and was endorsed bythe plaintiff's cashier and by that firm for
deposit, thus: "Dep. acct. C. J.-Kershaw & Co. C. J. Kershaw & Co." This draft was endorsed over oin the same day
by the plaintiff to the American Exchange National Bank of

Opinion of the Court.

New York, for collection for account of the plaintiff, and was
duly presented to the drawee on the 17th of June, 1887. Payment was refused, the draft was duly protested and returned
to the plaintiff, and notice of protest was duly given to the
drawer. Another draft for $100,000, numbered 16,413, and not
involved in cithe- of the suits Nos. 1110 and 1111, was drawn
by the Fidelity Ba.- on the Chemical National Bank of New
York City to the order of C. J. Kershaw & Co., and was endorsed and deposited with the plaintiff by that firm on June
15, 1887. It also was sent forward, payment was refused, it
was protested, and notice was. given to the drawer. A claim
for its amount having been rejected by the receiver, a suit was.
brought on it by the plaintiff against the receiver, and a decree
was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for its full amount. The
third suit was No. 1111.
The plaintiff and the Fidelity Bank were corresponding
banks, and made collections for each other. The copart iership
of C. J. Kershaw & Co. was composed of Charles J. Kershaw
and Ramilton Dewar, as general partners, and Charles B.
Eggleston, as special partner.- It was engaged in the grain
commission business on the board of trade in Chicago, and
kept its sole bank account with the plaintiff. In March, 1887,
and before that time, it began to purchase wheat on orders
from Wilshire, Eckert & Co., who were commission rherchants
in Cincinnati; and it was buying wheat also for J. W. Hoyt,
another commission merchant in Cincinnati. It did not know
the principals for whom Wilshire, Eckert & Co. and Hoyt were
acting, and did not know until the 30th of May-that they were
acting for the same principal. It was the custom of Wilshire,
Eckert & Co. to transfer money to Kershaw & Co., for such
purchases, by advising, the latter that a certain §am bad been

Co. then drew a draft against such deposit, and deposited the
draft to their own credit with the plaintiff. Kershaw & Co.
selected the .Fidelity Bank as the bank in which they wished
the funds to be deposited. After the two ba-%nks became correspondents, money was transmitted also by certificates of deposit, substantially like the one in No. 1111 ; and, prior to the

15th of June, 1887, the Fidelity Bank had issued and sent to
the plaintiff four such certificates, on printed forms, reading as

These certificates were issued for five different deposits made

On the 2d of May, 1887, the Fidelity Bank sent another
telegram to the plaintiff, announcing that Wilshire, Eckert &
Co. had deposited with it, to the credit of the plaintiff, for
account of Kershaw & Co., $100,000.
The. Fidelity Bank, therefore, had advised the plaintiff,
prior to June 15, 1887, that it had received six different
deposits to the credit of the plaintiff for the use of Kershaw
& Co., amounting in the aggregate to $353,000, and that four
of those deposits, amounting to $250,000, had been made by
Wilshire, Eckert & Co. It was the custom of the plaintiff, on
receiving such certificates -of deposit, to place the amount of
the same to the credit of Kershaw & Co., and allow them to
check against the same as deposits of money; and the four
certificates were all paid by the Fidelity Bank.- It was also
the custom of the plaintiff to place to the credit of Kershaw
& Co., as cash, any drafts which they drew on Cincinnati and
deposited with it.
On the 13th of June, 1887, Wilshire was in Chicago, and
promised Kershaw & Co., that he would deposit on the next
day $200,000 for their use, in the Fidelity Bank. Wilshire
returned to Cincinnati that night, and on June 14th Kershaw
& Co., in anticipation of that deposit, left their draft for
$200,000 with the plaintiff, asking the latter to find out by
telegram if the deposit had been made, and if so, to forward
the draft for collection. The plaintiff telegraphed to the
Fidelity Bank, on June 14, as follows: "Has two hundred.
thousand been placed with you- for C. J. K. & Co. ?" The

Fidelity Bank on the same day 'replied: "Not yet made," and
,the draft was not sent forward. In consequence of this promise of Wilshire, and the previous course of dealing between the
.two banks, the plaintiff was prepared to receive, on the
morning of June 15, as hereafter mentioned, the certificate of
deposit for $200,000.
The state of the account of Kershaw & Co. with the plaintiff, on the morning of June 14, 1887, was this: They-owed
the plaintiff $380,378.37 overdraft and $280,000 in notes;
against which the plaintiff held as collateral security 692,688
bushels of wheat, 5000 bushels of corn, and certain wheat
then being loaded for shipment. The total value of such
collateral, on the morning of that day, was $736,000, and the
total indebtedness of Kershaw & Co. to the plaintiff w-s
$660,378.37. During that day there was a panic in wheat,
and the price fell from 92 cents to 74A, cents a bushel. The
security of the plaintiff fell in value at a corresponding rate,
and at 1 o'clock in the afternoon was worth only $544,894.
Itershaw & Co. then owed the plaintiff $525,477.01, namely,
$280,000 in notes and $245,477.01 overdraft. Thereupon the
plaintiff stopped paying the checks of Kershaw & Co., the
amount of the checks refused being about $60,000.
The state of the account between the Fidelity Bank and
the plaintiff on the 14th of June, 1887, was as follows: The
former owed the latter a balance of something over $100,000,
consisting in part of a draft drawn on the forrher by Wilshire,
Eckert & Co., to the order of Kershaw & Co., on the 13th of
June, and deposited by Kershaw & Co. with the plaintiff on
that day. The plaintiff, in accordance with its custom, had
treated such draft as a cash item, and had paid the checks
of Kershaw & Co. against it, on the 14th. On the night of
the 13th, that draft had been sent by the plaintiff to the
Fidelity Bank for payment, and on the 14th the latter telegraphed the plaintiff that it was paid. Payment was made
by placing the amount to tbl credit of the plaintiff on the
books of the Fidelity Bank. On the same day (June 14) the
plaintiff telegraphed to the Fidelity Bank, "remit at once
hundred thousand, clearing-house currency or gold;" in re-

Opinion of the Court.

sponse to which it received, on the morning of the 15th,
$50,000 in currency by express, and a draft for $50,000, drawn
by the Fidelity Bank on the Chemical National Bank of 1ew
York, which was duly paid by the drawee. At the close of
business on the 14th of June, the plaintiff had security enough
to make itself whole as respected Kershaw & Co., and it had
called upon the Fidelity Bank for substantially the whole
balance of account due from that bank, and the same had been
sent on. The plaintiff had, therefore, no inducement to take
any unusual risk, in regard to the transactions now to be
stated.
Just after the plaintiff had closed its bank for business on
the 14th of June, it received the following telegram:
"CINCINNATI,

0., 6/14, 1887.

"Am. Ex. Nat. -Bank:
"Joseph Wilshire will be at your bank to-morrow morning
with six hundred thbusand dollars to make his' trade with
Kershaw and others good if they are protected until he arrives.
"FI:IELrrY NAT. BArx."
The cashier of the plaintiff sent for Kershaw & Co., showed
them this telegram, and told them that, while the plaintiff
wanted to do everything in its. power to assist them, it could
not agree to protect them in any manner. Kershaw & Co.
replied in substance that if Wilshire came from Cincinnati
that night, he would arrive about 8 o'clock the next morning,
and that they needed no protection for the time before his
arrival. Kershaw & Co. then suggested and dictated the following telegram, which was sent by the cashier of the plain-.
tiff:

The same night, two telegrams were received by the plaintiff, which read as follows:

"FmE='TY

NAT. BANK."

Kershaw & Co. were also advised by telegram from Cincinnati the same afternoon that $600,000 would be sent to Chicago
that night.
Wilshire arrived in Chicago on the morning of June 15, and
went to the plaintiff's- bank, where he had an interview with
Kershaw, Dewar and Eggleston, all the members of the firm
of Kershaw & Co. Kershaw and Dewar figured up how
much money they needed, and estimated that they needed
$68,000 to settle up trades through the clearing-house of the
board of trade, $90,000 to deposit for additional margins,
and $60,000 to make good the checks Which the plaintiff had
refused to pay the day before, making a total of $218,000.
The cashier of the plaintiff took down those figures at the
time. Wilshire went out and shortly afterwards returned
with an envelope from which he took four drafts, (one of
which was the draft in suit in No. 1110,) and the certificate of
deposit in suit in No. 1111. Each of the four drafts was for
the sum of $100,000, dated June 14, 1887, and drawn by the
Fidelity Bank on the Chemical National Bank of New York.
One, was-payable to the order of Wilshire, Eckert & Co., one
to the order of J. W. Wilshire, (not sued on,) one to the order
of C. J. Kershaw & Co., and the other (in suit in No. 1110) to
the order of the plaintiff. The four drafts and the certificate
of deposit made up the suin of $600,000.

ARMSTRONG -v. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK.

451

Opinion of the Court.

The two instruments involved in suits Nos, 1110 and 1111
were taken by Wilshire from the envelope and delivered by
him to Kershaw & Co. The plaintiff took them on deposit
from Kershaw & Co., and placed the amounts of them to the
credit of the latter, in accordance with the usual course of
business, together with another of the drafts, for the sum of
$100,000. Kershaw & Co. thus received $400,000 of the paper,
Irwin, Green & Co. receiving the remainder, $200,000. The,
evidence shows ,that the two drafts and the certificate'"of
deposit were taken by the cashier of the plaintiff on its behalf,
and placed to the credit of Kershaw & Co. by the plaintiff,
without any agreement or arrangement fon the part of, the
plaintiff, except to credit them to Kershaw & Co. as cash.
Before the plaintiff received' this $400,000, the account of
Kershaw & Co. with it was overdrawn $245,477,01, as before
stated. On receiving the deposit the plaintiff placed to the
credit of Kershaw & Co., as cash, in a single item, $399,200,
the full amount of the deposit less $800 charged for exchange. This was according to the usual course of business
between the plaintiff and Kershaw & Co., and according to
the understanding of the parties at the time. This deposit
cancelled the overdraft of $245,477.01, and left a balance to
the credit of Kershaw & Co., on the morning of June 15, of
$153,722.99.
As soon as the plaintiff opened its bank on
that day there was a run upon the account of Kershaw & Co.,
and before 11 oclock in thle morning the plaintiff had paid orcertified their chebks to th, amount of $239,930.78. Meanwhile the plaintiff received on deposit $25,249.40, but this was
a draft drwn against a shipment of wheat, which,'the plaintiff had held as collateral security, and the plaintiff's condition
was not bettered thereby. The plaintiff,- therefore, in reliance upon such deposit of $399,200, not only cancelled Kershaw &. Co.'s overdraft of $245,477.01, but 41so gave them
$239,930.78 of fresh money, making a total of $485,407.79.
By crediting the paper as cash, and using it ta cancel the
overdraft, the plaintiff also waived its right to sell for that
purpose the grain which it held as collateral security. The
result was that when the plaintiff did sell, the grain, after the

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court

paper of the Fidelity Bank was dishonored, it realized only
$449,194.88 for the same grain which, when the plaintiff
stopped paying Kershaw & Co.'s checks on June 14, was
worth $544,894, being a shrinkage of $95,699.12.
When the plaintiff had paid Kershaw & Co.'s checks to
the amount of $239,930.78, their account was overdrawn
$60,958.39; and when it was found by Kershaw & Co. that
it would take $200,000 (instead of $68,000) to pay their
differences in the board of trade clearing-house, the plaintiff
refused to certify their checks for $200,000, and they therefore
suspended payment.
The Fidelity Bank placed the amount of the certificate of
deposit involved in suit No. 1111 to the credit of the plaintiff,
and the latter charged the same on its books to the Fidelity
Bank, as a cash deposit, and notified the Fidelity Bank that
it had done so. From the 28th of April, 1887, when the
Fidelity Bank sent the first certificate of deposit to tl3 plaintiff, down to the 15th of June, 1887, the Fidelity Bank bad
represented that Wilshire, Eckert & Co. were depositing funds
with it, which it was remitting to the plaintiff ; and the telegrams of June 14, 1887, from the Fidelity Bank, held out
Wilshire as the owner of the $600,000 which he was to take
to Chicago to protect the trades. During the six days while
the Fidelity Bank remained open after the paper in question
was taken by the plaintiff, the Fidelity Bank made no cornplaint that the plaintiff had not acted in all the transactions
in an honest manner, and in accordance with the instructions
of the Fidelity Bank.
What took place betveen the officers of the Fidelity Bank and
Wilshire, which the receiver alleges in his answer amounted
to a conspiracy to embezzle the funds of that bank, was not
revealed to the plaintiff until it was disclosed by the evidence
taken in the suits.
. In regard to No. 1110 it is contended by the receiver that
the draft could not take effect until it was delivered to the
plaintiff; that such delivery must have been made by the
Fidelity Bank; that therefore Wilshire was acting for that
bank in delivering the draft; and that, as between the Fi-

Opinion of the Court.

delity Bank and the plaintiff, want of consideration may be

shown.
I
The draft in questiom was drawn in Ohio, upon, a bank in
New York, and was payable in New York. It was, therefore,
a foreign bill of -exchange. Where there are four parties to
such a bill, namely, the drawer, the drawee, the payee, and
the remitter or purchaser, the usual course of business is for
the drawer to deliver it to the remitter or purchaser, and for
the latter to deliver it to thepayee, In such a course of dealing, the remit.ter does not act as the agent of the drawer, but
acts for himself, and in a suit on the bill by the payee against
the drawer, want of consideration cannot be shown, if the
payee is a bona)&& holder for value. Munroe v. Bordier,.8

When Wilshire went to the plaintiff's bank, on the morning. of -June 15, 1887, he.came duly accredited by the Fidelity
Bank as the purchaser of the $600,000 of paper which he
brought ; and he acted as such in delivering the draft in suit
No. 1110. The fact that the draft was payable to the order
of the plaintiff was not, inconsispite
with the representation
that Wilshire held it as purchaser and remitter. Wilshire
received value for it from Kershaw & Co., and acted with
them in getting the draft placed to their credit as cash by the
plaintiff; so that the plaintiff became the holder of the draft
for value. Wilshire gave to Kershaw & Co. the $400,000 on
account of*the' indebtedness of Wilshire, Eckert & Go. to
them. As W'ilshire delivered the paper to Kershaw & Co.
with the knowledge of the plaintiff,. and with the understanding that the plaintiff was to take it and place it to the credit
of Kershaw & Co., the past indebtedness of Wilshire, Eckert
& Co. to Kershaw & Co. was a sufficient consideration to
give to the plaintiff a good title to the paper for the use of
Kershaw & Co.; and it is manifest that the inducement to
Wilshire to give the paper -to Kershaw & Co. was chiefly the
consideration that the plaintiff would give credit at once to

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

Kershaw & Co. for the 'amount. This credit was given, and
on. the faith of it the plaintiff paid to Kershaw & Co. on
their checks, $239,930.78.
The plaintiff thus became the
owner of the paper which it received on deposit. Clark v.

We do not think that the fact that the draft was payable to
the order of the plaintiff was notice to the plaintiff that Wilshire was not its purchaser or remitter; or that the manner in
which the plaintiff acted after taking the draft for deposit
shows that the plaintiff was not a bona fide holder for value.
The draft for $100,000, in suit No. 1110, and the draft for
$100,000 to the order of Kershaw & Co., showed a difference
in form, which was noticed by the assistant cashier of the
plaintiff, who feared that the Fidelity Bank might claim subsequently that the draft payable to the order of the plaintiff
was a part of the $200,000 mentioned in the certificate of deposit in suit in No. 1111. He therefore sent to the Fidelity
Bank this telegram:
"O CIAGO, 15 June, 1887.
"F Fidelity NationalBank, Cincinnati, Ohio.
.

"Your draft on New York, number sixteen four twelve, delivered us this morning, is made payable to our order. Why
was this done, and is the amount charged against us or is it
intended for use of W., as he may direct? Answer quick.
"AMERIOAN

ExoHANGE NATioN&L Biw."

This telegram was sent, as the cashier says, "as an extra
precaution ;" but, without waiting for a reply to it, the plaintiff paid the checks of Kershaw & Go. until their account was
not onlyj exhausted but was overdrawn $60,958.39, when fur-

ERICAN EXCHANGE BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

ther payment of. their checks was stopped. This was two
hours before any reply by telegram was. received from the
Fidelity Bank. When the reply came, it did not disavow the
authority of Wilshire to use the draft No. 16,412 as a part of
the $600,000, the reply being as follows:
"OCnwNATi, Ohio, June 15, 1887.
"American .ExchangelVaiona Bank, Chicago.
'"We want number sixteen four twelve to apply on your account, and have wired parties. Please send all drafts to us
and order Cincinnati National to deliver one to-day. Party
that controls special account out of city. Answer.
"FiDELy NATIONAL BANK."

The inference to be drawn'from this telegram was that draft
No. 16,412 had been given to Wilshire for his use, b.ut that
since it had been issued something had occurred which made
the Fidelity Bank desire to withdraw it, if it could'obtain the
consent of the parties in interest, to whom it had wired. " The
telegram from the plaintiff was sufficient to notify the Fidelity
Bank that Wilshiie was using draft No., 16,4-12 ad a 'part bf
the $600,000 ; and it gave the Fidelity Bank an opportunity
to "answer quick" that Wilshire had no right to use that draft
in that way if such were the fact. There was nothing in the
reply telegram from the Fidelity Bank, even if it had been
received in time, to warn the plaintiff, not to place that draft
to the credit of Kershaw & Co., and nothing to discredit WrilsAire's title to it. After that, and until"the time when the
Fidelity Bank-closed its doors, it made no claim that ihe draft
No. 16,412 was not' issued in good faith as a part of the
$600,000, or that the plaintiff had appliea it wrongly to the
credit of Kershaw & Co.
While the plaintiff was paying the checks of Kershaw*& Co.,'
the two drafts for $100,000 each and the certificate of depotit
were in the hands of its assistant cashier, on the way to be
entered upon its books, and While they were in his hands he
made out the following deposit ticket:

*

This ticket was handed to the teller with the deposit, before
the note at the bottom was put upon it; but immediateiy
afterwards the assistant cashier went back to the teller and
added the note. This deposit ticket was not made out when
the deposit was made.
It appears that when the deposit was taken, the cashier of
the plaintiff made out a deposit ticket showing one item of
$400,000 deposited by Kershaw & Co., which ticket was
made out at their request when they handed the deposit to
the cashier and told him to place it to their credit. That deposit ticket did not come to the hands of the assistant cashier,
and he made out the above deposit ticket; but there is no
evidence to show that the latter deposit ticket was ever seen
or assented to by Kershaw & Co., br by Wilshire. It appears that Kershaw & Co. did not know that the plaintiff
had not placed the deposit at once to their credit on its books,
although they did know of the telegram which the plaintiff
sent to the Fidelity Bank. The above deposit ticket was thus
made out by the assistant cashier of the plaintiff, for the use
of the,plaintiff; and it did not change in any way the terms
of the deposit as between the plaintiff and Kershaw & Co.,
being only a private memorandum for the guidance of the
paying teller. The credit on the books of the plaintiff was
not made in accordance with the terms of that ticket, the

credit being in one item, of $399,200, and unconditional, the
note at the bottom of the ticket not being carried into
the books of the plaintiff.
These words in the telegram of June 15 from the Fidelity
Bank," Please send all drafts to us, and order Cincinnati National to deliver one to-day. Party that controls special account out of -city," are explained thus: On the 14th of June,
Irwin, Green & Co. deposited with the plaintiff a draft of
theirs on the Fidelity Bank for $217,862.50, which the plaintiff
sent to the Cincinnati National .Bank for collection. It was
presented on the 15th of June to the Fidelity Bank, which
refused to pay it, alleging that the deposit against which the
draft was drawn had not been made. Irwin, Green & Co.,
however, held a certificate of deposit issued by the Fidelity
Bank, and their draft was drawn against that deposit. The
party, Hoyt, who controlled the special deposit was out of
the city of Cincinnati, but he was in Chicago, and said that
the draft was all right, and ought to be paid. The telegram
from the Fidelity Bank contained also the request that the
plaintiff should order the Cincinnati National. Bank to turn
over to the Fidelity Bank, without payment, such draft for
$217,862.50, and should send directly to the Fidelity Bank all
drafts upon the latter.
On the 16th of June, four telegrams passed between Wilshire and the plaintiff, which show that the plaintiff did "not
suspect that Wilshire had any connection with the Fidelity
Bank or its officers. The first was as follows:
"Cn-oTNNATI, Ohio, 6/16, 1887.
"To Am. Ex,. Bank:
"After yesterday's understanding Kershaw must be protected to-day. Should this be done, all is well, if not, fear
trouble to all.

The plaintiff replied as follows, under date of June 17th:
"WlIrire, Cincnnati, Ohio:

On the 16th of June the plaintiff received the following letter from th.e Fidelity Bank:

A ]MSTRONG v. AMERICAN EXCHANGt BANK.

459

Opinion of the Court.

The telegram dated June 17, from the plaintiff to Wilshire,
shows that the plaintiff was determined to avoid trouble over
draft No. 16,412, which it had credited to Kershaw & Co., but
which the Fidelity Bank had charged to the plaintiff.
Wilshire left Chicago during the night of June 15, knowing
the exact condition of things between Kershaw & Co. and the
plaintiff. Be reported to Harper at Cincinnati the next morning, and at the very time when he was sending his two telegrams of June 16 to the plaintiff, he and Harper were arranging further to defraud the plaintiff by stopping payment of
the drafts which Wilshire took to Chicago. They telegraphed
the Chemical National Bank not to pay them, and when the
four drafts were presented it refused to pay them. Harper
and Hopkins, on the 16th of June, charged draft No. 16,412 to
the plaintiff on the books of the Fidelity Bank, but they entered it in the transactions of June 15, and changed the footings of the column in which the entry was made.
In reply to the suggestion that the plaintiff took the draft
No. 16,412, as collateral security, and therefore was not a bonz
fde holder of it, it is to be said that the plaintiff took the
deposit as a cash deposit, and that there was no agreement
with Kershaw & Co. that the deposit should be held only as
security; because the amount of the deposit was credited as
cdsh on the books of the plaintiff, at or about 11 o'clock on the
morning of June 15, and the plaintiff paid the checks of Kershaw & Co. on the faith of the deposit of the draft.
The conclusion of the whole matter is, that the Fidelity
Bank represented to the plaintiff that Wilshire was a bonafide
holder of draft No. 16,412, for his use in making good his
trades with Kershaw & Co.; that the plaintiff, relying on such
representations, took the draft on deposit -fromKershaw & Co.,
placed it to their credit, and paid their checks; and that,
under those circumstances, the Fidelity Bank was estopped
from showing that Wilshire was not a bonajde holder of the
draft, and the receiver stands in no better position than the
Fidelity Bank.
The decree of the Circuit Court in No. 1110 was, therefore,
right.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opiion of the' Court.

As to No. 1111, the paper in question was in its legal
character a certificate of deposit. Hart v. Life Association,
54 Alabama, 495; Long v. Straus, 107 Indiana, 94; Lynch v.
Goldsmith, 64. Georgia, 42, 50; Rowe v. lartness, 11 Ohio St.
440; Miller v. Austen, 13 How. 218.
The certificate stated that Wilshire, Eckert & Co. had deposited so much money. The Fidelity Bank telegraphed to
the plaintiff that Wilshire would come with so much money.
It intended that the plaintiff slioald take the paper as money.
The plaintiff did take it as money, and the Fidelity Bank
entered the paper on its books as being its. own check upon
itself. 'Wilshire went to the plaintiff on the morning of June
15 as the purchaser and controller of the certificate in like
manner as he went as the purchaser and controller of draft
No. 16,412. At the request of Wilshire, Eckert & Co., the
Fidelity Bank issued the certificate directly to the plaintiff.
What has been said -before, in relation to the claim of the
plaintiff as the holder of the 'draft No. 16,412, applies with
equal'force to its claim as the holder of the certificate. It was
a, pnrchaser, and an innocent purchaser, for value, of both
pieces of paper. There is no question of negotiability, because
the suit is brought *by the original payee, and the paper was
applied by- the plaintiff for the use of Kershaw & Co., as
directed by the certificate.
As soon as the paper was delivered to and accepted by
the plaintiff, the Fidelity Bank had entered into a contract
with it to pay $200,000. The suit is for the amount which
the Fidelity Bank agreed to pay, and not for damage sustained
by the plaintiff through the misrepresentation of that bank.
The, plaintiff accepted the contract in good faith, by placing
$200,000 to the credit of Kershaw & Co.; and it also charged
-$200,000 to the Fidelity Bank, and notified that bank that it
had done s9. The Fidelity Bank acted on that contract, after
it was notified of its acceptance by the plaintiff, by placing
$200,000 to the credit of the plaintiff, and charging that
amount to Wilshire, Lokert & Co. The plaintiff was not
required to pay the Fidelity Bank-anything upon the contract,
because the Fidelity Bank represented that Wilshire, Eckert
& Co. had paid for it.

ARMSTRONG v. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK. "461
Opinion of the Court.

The plaintiff was required, if it acceptdd the contract, to give.
the benefit of it to Kershaw & Co. It did that by at once
giving Kershaw & Co. credit "or 3200,000; and tbat.amount
still stands on its books to the credit of Kershaw &Do. The
defendant cannot escape the consequences of the contract pf
the Fidelity Bank by saying that the statement of that bank
that it had received from Wilshire, Eckert & Co. the consideration for the contract was false, because he is estopped from
'setting up for his protection the falsity of that statement after
the plaintiff hli acted upon it. The plaintiff is seeking to
recover iapon a contract, and the receiver is defending by
setting up the false representation of the Fidelity Bank.
The suggestion is not a sound one that the plaintiff took the
paper under such circumstances as would put a man of ordinary prudence upon inquiry. The Fidelity Bank, prior to June
14, 1887, had notified the plaintiff of four deposits made with
the former by Wilshire's firm, for the use of Kershaw & Co.,
in April and May, 188%, amounting together to $250,000. For
each of those d6posits the Fidelity Bank had issued paper similar to that in suit in No. 1111. The amounts were placed'to
the credit of Kershaw & Co. by the plaintiff, and were paid by
the Fidelity Bank to the plaintiff in the due course of business.
Nothing passed between the two banks to indicate that the
Fidelity Bank knew what Wilshiro's -firm was doing with the
-money, until the telegram of June 14, from the Fidelity Bank
to the plaintiff, was received by the latter. The plaintiff was
banker for Kershaw & Co., and had that day stopped payment
of their checks. Kershaw & Co. were the brokers of Wilshire's
firm, and had bought a large quantity of wheat for them for
future delivery, which needed immediate protection by the'deposit of margins. The Fidelity Bank was the banker in Cincinnati of Wilshire's firm, and the two banks were regular
correspondents. It was n.tural for Wilshire to ask his bank to
send the telegram to Kershaw & Co.'s bank, and there was nothing in that to put a prudent institution upon inqui"y.' It was
natural that the cashier of the plaintiff should understand that
the two banks were carrying on the telegraphic correspondence
solely for the -benefit of their respective customers ; and the'

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff was led to expect that Wilshire would arrive the next
morning with $600,000 of his own money, to use in making
good his trades with Kershaw and others. There was nothing
in the telegram to lead the plaintiff to understand that Wilshire would be in Chicago with $600,000 of the money of the
Fidelity Bank, to make good trades of his for that bank. The
appearance of Wilshire the next morning with $600,000 would
naturally lead the plaintiff to believe that it was his own
money, and the same money spoken of in the telegram of the
day before from the Fidelity Bank.
' There was nothing in the paper brought by Wilshire to lead
the plaintif. to suspect that the money was the money of the
Fidelity Bank. The paper was all in proper form to be controlled by Wilshire, and-to be used by him to protect his
trades with Kershaw and others. The cashier of the plaintiff
had suggested by telegram to the Fidelity Bank, on the 14th
of June, that Wilshire.should bring currency. As he brought
paper, which, if the plaintiff took it, must be treated as money,
and as the plaintiff had another draft on the Fidelity Bank for
$21T,862.50, deposited by Irwin, Green & Co., which was then
in Cincinnati for collection, the cashier of the plaintiff, before
finally taking the paper, asked Wilshire if the Fidelity Bank
was solvent. This indicated no suspicion of the true state of
facts, as they were subsequently disclosed, and the question
was a natural one to be put to a person who was having large
money transactions with the Fidelity Bank, and who had just
endorsed. its two drafts for $100,000 each. The attorney of
the plaintiff was at the bank, and before its cashier took the
paper he told the attorney what Wilshire had said, and that
everything appeared perfecfly straight. He would not have
talen the paper and paid out nearly $24:0,000 on the faith of
it if he had suspected that it was otherwise than the bonafle
paper of the Fidelity Bank, issued for a like amount of money
received by that bank.
When the plaintiff learned that the Fidelity Bank had refused to pay the Irwin, Green & Co: draft for $217,862.50,
and when it had received the telegram of the Fidelity Bank
asking that that draft be turned over to it without payment,

ARMSTRONG v. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

it lost confidence in the solvency of the Fidelity Bank; bul
it still believed Wilshire to be the true principal, and telegraphed him to put his money in another bank. Wilshire
replied by telegram, on June 16: "Will go to work at once
and arrange matter; but you must see 1Kershaw through without fail. You should have wired us sooner, and would have
fixed you up as desired," thus keeping up the deception.
The rumors on the board of trade and in the public press
that Harper was the real principal for whom Wilshire was
acting, cannot affect the plaintiff. There is no evidence that
any officer of the plaintiff ever heard any rumor connecting
Harper's name with the purchases of grain. Even if the
plaintiff had learned as a fact that Harper was buying wheat
through Wilshire, that would not have been notice that the
statement in the certificate of deposit, that Wilshire, Eckert
& Co. had deposited $200,000, was false; nor would it have
been notice that Harper was using the funds of the Fidelity
BE ak. The drafts and the certificate of deposit were all of
them signed by Hopkins, the assistant cashier of the Fidelity
Bank. Nothing occurred to make the plaintiff suspicious of
the bona Jfie character of the paper; and Wilshire, by delivering the paper, affirmed the statement of the Fidelity Bank
thqt his firm had deposited $200,000 to the credit of the
plaintiff. Wilshire was concerned in concealing the truth.
He had come for the express purpose of deceiving the plaintiff ; and the latter-cannot be charged with negligence in not
asking for information from him. There "isno evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had any suspicion that Harper,
,Hopkins and Wilshire had conspired together to embezzle the
funds of theyidelity Bank, or that the paper was signed by
Hopkins, and delivered by Harper to Wilshire, to be used in
purchasing wheat. The success of the conspiracy depeiided
on the concealment of the fact that Wilshire, Eck.ert & Co.
were not depositing with the- Fidelity Bank the amounts for
which it was issuing its papeh. There was authority to issue
the paper, if Wilshire, Eckert & Co. made the deposit; and
the consequence of the fraud must fall upon the Fidelity Bank,
and not upon the, plaintiff.

OCTOBER TERAT, -1889.
Opinion of the Court.

As to the suggestion that the plaintiff was not warranted in
giving an immediate credit of $200,000 to Kershaw & Co. on
the faith of the certificate of deposit, it is to be said that so
far as the face of the paper is concerned it was left to the
option of the plaintiff either to give Kershaw & Co. the immediate use of the money, or to await the collection of the
money on the certificate. It is apparent that the Fidelity
Bank, in issuing the paper, intended that the plaintiff should
use it as money, and the emergency upon Kershaw & Co.
required such use of it.
In reply to the claim on the part of the receiver that if the
plaintiff caa recover at all it can recover only 'the money which
it .paid out in reliance on the certificate, it is to be said that
that instrument is a contract by the Fidelity Bank offering to
the plaintiff to become its debtor in the sum of $200,000, and
asking it to become a creditor of the Fidelity Bank, for the
benefit of Kershaw &.Co., the object beihg to convert a credit
in Cincinnati, for which Wilshire, Eckert & Co. had paid, into
a credit in Chicago with the plaintiff, as the banker of Kershaw & Co., for the use of that firm. Tbe plaintiff accepted
this offered contract, assumed the relation of creditor to the
Fidelity Bank, for the use of Kershaw & Co., and at once
gave them credit for $200,000, thus fully complying with the
contract. When the plaintiff placed $400,000 to the credit of
Kershaw & Co., it paid them that amount; and the legal
effect of the transaction was the same -as if the plaintiff had
given $400,000 in currency to Kershaw & Co., and they had
deposited it to their credit in some other bank.
The plaintiff held Kershaw & Co.'s check for $256,878.18,
which it was carrying. The check was regular and the plaintiff
had a right to have it paid at once. It had not been charged
up, for there was only $11,401.17 in Kershaw & Co's account
against which to charge it; but in stating the overdraft on
the evening of June 14, we have treated it as if it had been
debited. That check was paid by the plaintiff and charged to
Kevshaw & Co., on the morning of June 15, in reliance upon
the deposit of the Fidelity Ban. paper for $400,000. The
ilaintiff had the right to apply the deposit of Kershaw & Co.

ARMSTRONTG 'v.. AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

to the payment'of their indebtedness to it whici was due. ' It
Was the understanding of Kershaw & Co. that al" of theii outstanding checks should be paid from the deposit. In addition
to cancelling the check for $256,878.18, the plaintiff paid out
$239,930.78 on June 15. It therefore paid 'but during that
day $496,808.96.- If received on deposit $399,200 in Fidelity
Bank paper, and $25,249.40 in a draft drawn against a shipment of vheat, and there was a credit upon its books of $11,4017 at the beginning of business on that day. The debit
side of the account was therefore $496,808.96, and the cridit
$435,850.57, being an excess of debit of $60,958.39.
The plaintiff also forbore to sell the grain which. it held as
collateral- security for Kershaw & Co.'s indebtedness, and
which was worth on June 14, at the lowest market price of,
that day, $5441,894. After 'payment of the Fidelity Bank.
paper was refused, the plaintiff sold the, grain for $449,194, a
shrinkage of $95,700. There was no agreement that the plaintiff should hold the grain, but the deposit of $400,900 made it
unnecessary to sell it, and good faith toward Kershaw & Co.,
under the circumstances, required that that should not be
done. The plaintiff, therefore, iii reliance upon the paper of
the'Fidelity Bank, paid the check of Kershaw & Co. for $256,878.18, gave them $239,930.78 of Trther money, and suffered
a loss of $95,700 on the collateral security which it held.
We do not think that the matter of the application of the
proceeds of the collateral security has anything to do with
eitherof the cases.
As Kershaw & Co. deposited, and the plaintiff credited, the
three pieces of Fidelity Bank paper as a -single cash item,
whatever the plaintiff did on the faith of the deposit 'of $400,000 was done on the faith of each piece of paper which went
to make up that deposit. When the plaintiff accepted the
certificate of deposit, it was at liberty to use the credit for
$200,000 in any manner which it and Kershaw & Co. might
agree upon, the only requirement made by the Fidelity Bank
being that the credit shouldbe applied to the use of Kershaw
& Co. It was applied to such use as much by paying-their
indebtedness to the plaintiff as by paying what they owed to

Opinion of the Court.

any other party. As the plaintiff is seeking to recover on a
contract with which it has fully complied on its part, the receiver must fully comply with the other part of it; and if
Wilshire, Eckert & Co. did not put $200,000 in the Fidelity
Bank to the credit of the plaintiff, as that bank declared they
had done, the receiver must make good the representation by
placing a like amount to the credit of the plaintiff.
As to the defence that Harper, Hopkins and Wilshire, with
other persons, on and before June 14, 1887, were engaged in
purchasing wheat on contracts-for future delivery, and otherwise, with the object of creating a "corner" in the market;
that at the time of the delivery of the paper to the plaintiff it
had notice that they were engaged in such. speculation; and
that the certificate of deposit was delivered to Wilshire and by
him to the plaintiff to be used, through the plaintiff and by
Kershaw & Co., who were, and were well known to the plaintiff to be, brokers engaged in the purchase of ,wheat, in such
speculation, for the account of Wilshire and his confederates;
the defence amounts to this, that if the plaintiff received money
frdm the Fidelity Bank to be transferred to Kershaw & Co.,
it could refuse to pay over the in6ney to the latter if it knew
that they intended to use the money to pay a gambling debt
wbich the Fidelity Bank had contr'acted.
When the plaintiff received th4 deposit from Kershaw &
Co., it was bound to honor their checks against it; and it could
not refase~to pay them on the ground that Kershaw & Co. intended to make an improper use of the money. If Wilshire,
Eckert & Co. and Kershaw & Co. w e engaged in gambling,
and the former had-deposited money in the Fidelity Bank tW
be transferred to the plaintiff, in ordei' that Kershaw- & Co.
might check out the amount from the plaintiff's bank in payment of losses sustained in the gambling transactions, and'1th
banks knew that the money was to be so used, still the Fidelity
Bank, having received the deposit, could not refuse to pay it
over to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff, having received it, could
not refuse to honor the checks of Kershaw & Co., drawn
agaiist it. Tenant v. Elliott, 1 B. & P. 3 ; Far ner v. Russell,

Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483 ; kHc.Micken v. Pern,1.8 How. 507.
Nor do we think that the statute of Illinois, 1 Starr & Curtis, Stat. 1885, pp. 791, 792, sections 130, 131, or the case of
Pearce v. Foote, 113 Illinois, 228, haa any application to the
present case. That statute makes it an offence to "corner"
the market, or to attempt to do so, and makes void all contracts to reimburse or pay any money or property knowingly
lent or advanced at the time and place of any play or bet, to
any person gambling or betting. The two banks were not
attempting to corner the market in wheat. Whether Wilshire
and his confederates were engaged in attempting to do so, and
had made purchases for that purpose through Kershaw & Co.
as brokers, is another question. This is not a suit by Kershaw
& Co. against Wilshire or his firm, or against the Fidelity
Bank. It is a suit on a contract made by the Fidelity Bank'
with the plaintiff; and the receiver cannot defend it on the
ground that the plaintiff knew that if it paid over the money
to Kershaw & Co., as the Fidelity Bank requested, the money
would be used in an illegal transaction.
In Pearce v. Foote, sup, Foote made an express agreement with -certain commission men to trade exclusively in
differences in options, declaiing that he did not want to buy
any provisions, but simply to speculate and settle on differences.
He lost a large sum in such transactions, and endorsed over to
the commission men certain notes. The court held that such
options were gambling contracts, and that, as the' statute of
Illinois provided that any person who. should lose in a gam-'
bling transaction might recover, back -roi the winner what-.
ever he should pay on account of such loss, Foote could recover
the value of the notes from the commission men. But the
plaintiff is not the winner in any gambling transaction. The
purport of the decision in Pearce v. Foote is that, as-the commission men participated in the illegal transactiol, they could
not take the ground that' their interest was only that of a
commission. The plaintiff is not in the situation of the commission men, and the receiver is not in,the situation of Foote.

OCTOBER TERM 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

.The cases which have been decided in regard to the statute of
Illinois arose between brokers and principals, or between winner and loser, aid do not apply to the case at bar.
Jt is contended, however, by the receiver that the money
advanced by the plaintiff to Kershaw & Co., on the 15th of
June, was advanced knowingly at the time in the course of an
attempt to corner the market and to aid IKershaw & Co. in
doing so. The statute of Illinois makes void any contract
"for the reimbursing or paying any money or property knowingly lent or advanced at the time and place of such play or
bet to any person or persons so gaming or betting." This is
not a suit against Kershaw & Co. to recover money lent to
them; nor is it true that the plaintiff advanced money to
them to assist them in attempting to corner the market. It
is not averred in the answer, nor proved, that Kershaw & Co.
were engaged in such an attempf. The averment of the
answer is that Harper, Hopkins, Wilshire, and other persons
to the defendant unknown, were engaged in such an attempt,
and that Kershaw & Co. were acting as brokers; but it is not
averred that the brokers had any knowledge of the object of
their principals, and the evidence shows that they had no such
knowledge. The money which the plaintiff advanced to Kershaw & Co., on the 15th of June, was not lent to them on an
agrtement by them to repay it; but it was advanced to them
in consideration of the deposit with the plaintiff of the
$400,000 of Fidelity Bank paper. Nor is there any proof
that any of the money paid by the plaintiff to Kershaw & Co.,
on the 15th of June, was paid out for wheat purchased for
Wilshire, Eckert & Co. The burden was on the receiver to
show clearly that the money paid out wai upon illegal transactions. He fails to do. so; and much more does he fail to
show that the money was paid for present purchases; that is,
in the language of the statute, that it was advanced "at the
time and place" of the purchases, and not to pay debts
incurred in the making of past purchases. If it were shown
that the plaintiff advanced money to Kershaw & Co,, on the
15th of, June, to be used in paying for wheat which Kershaw
& Co. had purchased at some time in the past, in ah attempt

to corner the market, it would not follow -that the plaintiff
could not collect from them such advances.
Where losses have been made in an illegal transaction a
person who lends money to the loser with' which to pay the
debt capi recover the'loan, notwithstanding his knowledge
of the fact that the money was to, be so used. A nstrong v. Toler, 11 Wheat. 258; Zimbro v. Bullitt, 22 How.

Tyler v. Carlisle, 79 Maine, 210; MeGavock v. Puryear, 6
Coldwell, 34; Waugh v. Beek, 114 Penn. St. 422.
It is not shown, as is claimed by the receiver, that in
advancing the money to Kershaw & Co. the plaintiff became
a participator in an illegal attempt to corner the market, or
that it had aided in such an attempt by previously advancing
money to them upon a part of the wheat as collateral security.
Although the plaintiff had advanced money from time to time
to them upon wheat as collateral security, there is no evidence
-that it knew, or -had any reason to suspect, that the wheat
was purchased in an attempt to corner the market.
An obligation will be enforced, though indirectly connected
with an illegal transaction, if it is supported by an indepen-'
dent consideration, so that the plaintiff does not require the aid
of the illegal transaction to make out his case. Armstrong v.

Although the contract between the two banks was made
in the State of Illinois, it was to be performed in the State
of Ohio; and, the receiver being estopped from saying that
Wilshire, Eckert & Co. did hot-deposit the $200,000 in the
Fidelity Bank to the credit of the plaintiff, it is the law of
Ohio (Eirman v. Insurance Co., 35 Ohio St. 324) that he
cannot be heard to say that the plaintiff acquired the certificate of deposit in connection- with an illegal transaction.
The result, however, of the evidence is that it does:,not
appear, as alleged in the. answer of the receiver, that the

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff had knowledge or notice that the paper in suit was
.delivered to it to be used through it by Kershaw & Co. in
connection with an attempt to corner the market. A detailed
discussion of the evidence would not be profitable.
We think, therefore, that the Circuit Court was right 'in
making a decree against the receiver in No. 1111.
In both of the cases it is claimed that the court erred in
adjudging that the plaintiff was entitled to interest on the 25
per cent dividend on its claim, from October 31, 1887, until
the time the dividend should be paid. As authority the
receiver cites the case of White v. Zwx, 111 U. S. 784.
But we do not think it applies. In that case a judgment
was obtained for a claim by White, in June, 1883, which included interest on his claim to -iat time. While the claim
was in litigation, the receiver had paid ratable dividends of
65 per cent to other creditors. After the judgment in favor
of White, the Comptroller of the Currency calculated the
amount due him as of December 20, 1875, the time when the
bank failed, and paid him 65 per cent on that amount. lHe
contended that the dividend should be calculated on his claim
with interest to the time of the judgment; but this court
sustained the action of the Comptroller. In the present case,
the claims of the plaintiff, as allowed, do not include interest
beyond the date when the bank failed. Interest upon the
dividend which it ought to have received on the 31st. of
October, 1887, is a different matter. The allowance of that
interest is necessary to put the plaintiff on an equality with
the other creditors. That point was not decided in White v.
Enox; and we think the Circuit Court did not err in allowing
such interest.
It results that the decrees in both cases must be
