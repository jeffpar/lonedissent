BALT. TRACTION CO. v. BALT. BELT RAILROAD.

Syllabus.

such cases was taken away, although preserved by the joint
resolution of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1115, as to pending cases
and cases wherein the appeal. should be taken before July 1,
1891. The appeal was allowed January 7, 1891, but the decree
did not take final effect as of that date for the purposes of an
appeal, nor until February 11, 1892, because the application for
rehearing was entertained by the court, filed within the time
granted for that purpose, and not disposed of until then.
Aspen Mining &o. Co. v. Billings, 150 U. S. 31.
The appeal bond was not given until April 15, 1892, but the
record was filed in this court April 19, 1892, which was one of
the days of the October term, 1891, of this court. Notwithstanding this, however, and without considering the question
as to whether this appeal was properly prosecuted, in respect
of parties, within Hardee v. Wilson, 146 U. S. 179, we are of
opinion that as the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and this
court had not, long after July 1, 1891, the taking of a new
appeal became necessary upon the denial of the rehearing, and
this could only be to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. CincinnatiS&fe 1Lock Co. v. G'randRapids

BALTIMORE TRACTION COMPANY v. BALTIMORE
BELT RAILROAD COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE BALTIMORE CITY COURT.
No. 994.

Submitted December 11, 1893. -Decided January 8,1894.

A public act of the State of Maryland providing for the condemnation of
land for the use of a railroad company was held by the Court of Appeals
of that State to require notice to the owner of the land proposed to be
condemned, when properly construed. Held, that this court had no
jurisdiction over a writ of error to a court of that State, when the only
error alleged was the want of such notice, which, it was charged, invalidated the proceedings as repugnant to the Constitution of the United
States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.
MOTION TO DlSMISs.

The case is stated in the opinion.

.Mr. John Z Cowen and Xr'. WTilliam Irvine Cross for the
motion.
Mr. Nicholas P. Bond opposing.
THE CHIEF JUsTICE: These were proceedings in condemnation, commenced June 15, 1892, in accordance with section
167 of article 23 of the Code of Public General Laws of the
State of Maryland, plaintiff in error appearing therein.
It was objected below that that section violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,
in that the owner of land condemned thereunder might be
deprived of his property without due process of law because
the act did not provide for any notice to him of the proceedings; but it had been previously decided by the Court of
Appeals of Maryland that the act, properly construed, required notice. Baltimore Belt Railway Co. v. Baltzell, 75
Maryland, 103.
We are bound to accept this conclusion of the state court as
to the proper construction of the statute of the State. Green
v. -Neal,6 Pet. 291; Davie v. Briggs, 97 U. S. 628; L-ouisville
&c. Railway v. Mississippi, 133 U. S. 587, 590. At the time
of these proceedings, therefore, notice was required. No suggestion is made that the validity of the statute was drawn in
question as repugnant to the Constitution of the United States
in any other particular, and as the want of requirement of
notice did not exist, the alleged ground of our jurisdiction
fails.
Wpit of error dismissed.
