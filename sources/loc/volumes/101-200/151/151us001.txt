AND OMAHA RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL

FROM

THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF

THE UNITED STATES FOE

THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN.
No. 73.

Argued November $, 9,1893. -Decided January3, 1894.

The United States granted lands to the State of Wisconsin, to aid in the
construction of railroads. The State granted a portion of these lands
to a company, called in the opinion of the court The Omaha Company,
for the purpose of constructing a defined railroad. It also granted
another portion of them to another company, called in the opinion of
the court the Portage Company, for the purpose of constructing another
and different, and to some extent competing railroad. The latter grant
was conditioned upon the completion of the road by the grantee within
a specified period. Work was begun upon the Portage road, but in 1873
the company became embarrassed, and then broke down. In 1878 the
legislature of Wisconsin extended the time for the construction of the
Portage Company's road three years. In 1881 a contract was made with
A. for its completion, under which work was resumed with vigor and was
diligently prosecuted, with every prospect that the road would be completed within the extended time. In 1882, before the expiration of that
extension, the legislature of that State passed an act revoking the grant
to the Portage Company, and bestowing it upon the Omaha Company.
As a result of this the work which A. was diligently performing under
his contract was arrested; he was prevented through the direct and active
efforts of the Omaha Company from completing his performance of it;

Syllabus.
the profits which he would have received from it were lost to him; and
the land grant was wrested from the Portage Company. A. then commenced an action at law against the Portage Company, in which a judgment was recovered by his administratrix. Execution thereon being
returned nulla bona, a bill in equity was filed in the Circuit Court of the
United States by the administratrix against the Omaha Company, to
reach the land grant in its hands. The bill charged that the Omaha Company had conspired with and bribed certain officials of the Portage
Company, who, through circumstances named in the bill, had become
sole stockholders in that company, to wrest the land grant from the
Portage Company, and to prevent A. from completing his contract. It
set forth sundry steps in the alleged conspiracy, and charged that the
legislature of Wisconsin had been induced by the conspirators to pass the
act forfeiting the land grant and bestowing it upon the Omaha Company.
The defendant demurred and the demurrer was sustained by the Circuit
Court. Held:
(1) That the demurrer admitted that A. had suffered the wrongs complained of in consequence of the interference of the Omaha Company;
(2) That it must be assumed, as conceded by the demurrer, that the
officials of the Portage Company had been bribed by the Omaha
Company to betray their trust, and that the legislature had been
induced by false allegations to revoke the grant to the Portage
Company and to bestow it upon the Omaha Company;
(3) That as the breaking down of the Portage Company and the ruin
of its contractor was the natural and direct result of all this, the
contractor could resort to equity to enforce against the land grant
in the hands of the Omaha Company the judgment which he had
obtained at law against the Portage Company;
(4) That it must be presumed that the legislature, in transferring the
grant to the Omaha Company, did not intend to affect thereby
the rights of the Portage Company against the Omaha Company
in the courts;
(5) That as there was nothing in the words of the grant to the Omaha
Company which expressly tied up the granted land, it passed to
that company subject to seizure and sale in satisfaction of any of
its obligations;
(6) That the Omaha Company, by reason of -its conduct in this matter,
became, as to the creditors of the Portage Company, a trustee
ex maleficio in respect of this propeity.
If one maliciously interferes in a contract between two parties, and induces
one of them to break that contract to the injury of the other, the party
injured can maintain an action against the wrongdoer.
When a man does an act which in law and fact is a wrongful act, and
injury to another results from it as a natural and probable consequence,
an action on the case will lie.
A sole stockholder in a corporation cannot secure the transfer to himself of

all the property of the corporation so as to deprive a creditor of the corporation of the payment of his debt.
When an act of the legislature is challenged in a court, the inquiry by the
court is limited to the question of power, and does not extend to the
matter of expediency, to the motives of the legislators, or to the reasons
which were spread before them to induce the passage of the act; and, on
the other hand, as the courts will not interfere with the action of the
legislature, so it may be presumed that the legislature never intends to
interfere with the action of the courts, or to assume judicial functions to
itself.

THis was an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Western District of Wisconsin dismissing plaintiff's bill.
The bill was filed on the 23d of May, 1888, against the
Chicago, Portage and Superior Railway Company, the Chicago,
St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Company and the
Farmers' Loan and Trust Company. The Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Company was the only
defendant served with process. It appeared, and, on the 28th
of July, filed a demurrer to the bill which, after argument,
was sustained, and on September 2, 1889, the decree of dismissal was entered. 39 Fed. Rep. 143; 39 Fed. Rep. 912.
The facts as stated in the bill were as follows: By two acts,
of date June 3, 1856, and May 5, 1864, respectively, 11 Stat.
20, c. 43, and 13 Stat. 66, c. 80, Congress granted lands to the
State of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of certain railroads,
among others one "from a point on the St. Croix river or
lake, between townships twenty-five and thirty-one, to the
west end of Lake Superior, and from some point on the line of
said railroad, to be selected by said State, to Bayfield." These
land grants were accepted by an act of the legislature, approved October 8, 1856, (Laws Wisconsin, 1856, 137,) and by a
joint resolution of the legislature of the State, of date March
20, 1865, (Gen. Laws Wisconsin, 1865, 689,) and a map of
definite location was duly filed and accepted by the Secretary
of the Interior.
By an act of March 4, 1874, (Laws Wisconsin, 1874, 186,
c. 126,) the State granted to the North Wisconsin Railway
Company, whose name was subsequently changed to Chicago,

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Company, and
which is the defendant herein, (to be hereafter called the
Omaha Company,) that portion of the land grant applicable to
the construction of the road from a point on St. Croix River
to Bayfield, and to the Chicago and Northern Pacific Air-Line
Railway Company, whose name was subsequently, and before
1878, changed to that of the Chicago, Portage and Superior
Railway Company, (hereafter called the Portage Cofnpany,)
so much of said grant as was applicable to the construction of
the road from the west end of Lake Superior to a junction
with the line running from St. Croix River to Bayfield.
The eighth section of this act, which is the granting section
to the latter company, is as follows:
"There is hereby granted to the Chicago and Northern
Pacific Air-line Railway Company all the right, title, and
interest which the State of Wisconsin now has, or may hereafter acquire, in or to that portion of the lands granted to said
State by said two acts of Congress as is or can be made applicable to the construction of that part of the railway of said
company lying between the point of intersection of the
branches of said grants, as fixed by the surveys and maps on
file in the Land Office at Washington, and the west end of
Lake Superior. This grant is made upon the express condition
that said company shall construct, complete, and put in operation that part of its said railway above mentioned as soon as a
railway shall be constructed and put in operation from the
city of Hudson to said point of intersection, and within five
years from its acceptance of paid lands as herein provided, and
shall also construct and put in operation the railway of said
company from Genoa northerly, at the rate of twenty miles
per year."
The value of the lands thus granted was, at the time of the
wrongs hereinafter described, $4,000,000.
By section 12 the company was required within sixty days
to file with the secretary of State an acceptance of the grant
upon the terms and conditions named therein, and also such
security for the construction of the road as should be required
by the governor. Both of these conditions were complied with.

Statement of the Case.

Genoa, named in section 8, was the town on the southern
boundary of the State of Wisconsin, at which the line of the
Chicago and Northern Pacific Air-line Railway entered the
State, and Hudson was the place on the St. Croix River,
described in the acts of Congress as the initial point of the
road to be aided.
On March 16, 1878, an act was passed by the legislature of
Wisconsin, (Laws Wisconsin, 1878, 442, c. 229,) extending the
time for the construction of the Portage Company's road three
years.
In the panic of 1873-74 the Portage Company had broken
down, under a load of debts and embarrassments, and remained
inactive until 1880. At that time it secured the services of
Willis Gaylord to assist in extricating it from its embarrassments, and in continuing the construction of its road. William H. Schofield, an experienced railway projector and
financier, was induced to accept the office of president, and
the coiperation and assistance of the New Yorlk, New England and Western Investment Company (hereafter called the
Investment Company) was secured.
A new mortgage for $25,000 a mile, and a new issue of
stock, was provided for. Seven hundred thousand dollars of
the new bonds and one million of the new stock were to be
issued in full satisfaction of all outstanding stock, bonds, and
other demands. In pursuance of these arrangements, it issued
certificates of stock for one million dollars, in the name of
A. A. Jackson, general solicitor of the Portage Company,
which, endorsed by him .in blank, were deposited with the
Trust Company, and it also executed its orders to the number
of ninety, calling for the delivery to John C. Barnes or bearer
of a designated amount of said million dollars of stock in ten
per cent instalments. These orders were in the following
form:

These orders were all delivered to John C. Barnes in exchange for and redemption of all the theretofore outstanding
stock of the Portage Company, which stock was at once
cancelled, with the exception of two certificates for $25,000,
which, by oversight or design on the part of Charles J. Barnes,
vice-president of the Portage Company, remained in his custody uncancelled.
The situation after these arrangements were made was such
that the entire outstanding stock was in the possession and
control of C. J. Barnes, J. C. Barnes, and A. A. Jackson, yet
held by them in trust for the company. The further stock
provided for was to be issued from time to time to assist in
the sale of the bonds until enough of the latter had been disposed of to construct the road. These arrangements having

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.
Statement of the Case.

been perfected, the Portage Company, through its president,
sought the alliance and support of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company of Canada, which had recently completed an extension of its road to Chicago.
Three contracts were entered into, of dates June 16, 1881,
July 10, 1881, and September 30, 1881, by which the bonds of
the company were to be disposed of and money enough advanced for the construction of the road. The bill sets out
fully the nature and scope of these contracts, and copies of
them are attached as exhibits. It is unnecessary here to say
more than that, by them, taken in connection with the prior
arrangements of the Portage Company, the latter obtained
satisfactory assurances of abundant funds, and was placed in
a position to fully perform its agreement with the State and
construct the railroad by at least May 5, 1882- all this, of
course, upon the condition of no outside and wrongful interference.
Relying upon the.sufficiency of its arrangements for money,
it, on August 18, 1881, entered into a contract with Horatio
G. Angle for the construction of about sixty-five miles of its
railway, being that portion covered by the land grant heretofore referred to. By the.terms of that contract Angle was to
receive $8500 per mile in cash and $5000 per mile in the fullpaid stock of the company, on condition that he completed the
road on or before May 5, 1882. It also contracted for steel
rails and fastenings to be delivered as the work of construction proceeded.
Angle commenced work, and had made such progress that,
on the 20th of January, 1882, he had 1600 men employed
along the line, and it was an assured fact that, unless interfered with, he would complete the railway, according to the
terms of the contract, on or before May 5, 1882.
The bill further charges that about this time the Omaha
Company conspired with other parties to wrest from the
Portage Company its land grant, and to that end to prevent
the completion of the contract by Angle and the construction
of the road.
In the carrying out of this conspiracy, the conspirators

8

Statement of the Case.

bribed Charles J. Barnes and A. A. Jackson, officers of the
Portage Company, and who, either personally or as attorneys
in fact for John C. Barnes, had the control of all the outstanding stock of the Portage Company, though holding it in trust
for the benefit of the company, to betray their trust and transfer the stock to one L. J. Gage, for the benefit of the Omaha
Company.
Having thus secured the control of the stock, they caused
notice thereof to be given to the officers of the Grand Trunk
Railway Company. These gentlemen, finding that the control
of the Portage Company was passing into the hands of hostile
interests, surrendered the collateral which had already been
transferred to them, and declined to proceed further in the
contracts which had been entered into.
Continuing the execution of this conspiracy, the Omaha
Company notified the general manager of the Portage Company of the purchase of the outstanding stock, and advised
and induced him to telegraph officially to the engineer-in-chief
in charge of the work of construction, who had engaged in
that work seven engineering corps, to forthwith call in these
engineers, suspend their work, and pay them off. They also
caused the general manager to notify the contractor, Angle,
that the control of the company had been changed, and the
English capitalists forced out, and also to telegraph to the
merchants at Duluth and Superior City (who were furnishing
supplies to the 1600 men at work) that the company had been
sold out, advising them to protect themselves, because the
company could not pay or protect them.
In consequence of these notices, the several engineering
corps were broken up, the engineers left the work, all the
tools, material, and other personal property belonging to the
contractor and the company were attached at the suit of these
merchant creditors, and the 1600 laborers dispersed and wnt
elsewhere for work.
In further execution of this conspiracy it endeavored to
bribe the president and directors of the Portage Company and
the Investment Company to turn over the organization of the
Portage Company at once to them. Failing in this, it caused

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

Statement of the Case.

a bill to be filed in the Circuit Court for Cook County,
Illinois, falsely charging the president and board of directors

with incurring imprudent obligations and otherwise thus impairing the value of the million and twenty-five thousand
of stock, purchased as heretofore set forth, and praying for
a temporary injunction which, on February 11, 1882, was
granted without hearing or notice, and restrained the president and other officers of the Portage Company from doing
any act or thing whatsoever in the name oil behalf of the
company during the continuance of the injunction.
In still further execution of the conspiracy, the Omaha
Company caused the fact of the abandonment of the work
and the dispersion of the laborers engaged thereon to be
promptly and widely published throughout Wisconsin, and
especially among the members of the legislature, then in
session at Madison -concealing at the same time the means
by which this had been accomplished.
Further, through its own agents, and especially through
Jackson and Barnes, the corrupted officers of the Portage
Company, it falsely represented to the legislature that no
special progress had been made in the matter of constructing
this road; that no considerable number of men had ever been
at work, and that the Portage Company had finally abandoned
it, and was wholly without means or credit to prosecute it.
On the strength of these representations the legislature,
without inquiry or hearing, on February 16, 1882, (Laws
Wisconsin, 1882, p. 11, c. 9,) hurriedly passed an act forfeiting
and revoking the grant to the Portage Company and bestowing it upon the Omaha Company, which forfeiture and regranting were confirmed by an act passed March 5, 1883.
Laws of 1883, 19, c. 29.
The contract with Angle having been thus broken by the
Portage Company he commenced an adtion at law against
that company. While this action was pending Angle died,
but a revivor was had in the name of the present plaintiff,
and on January 31, 1887, she recovered a judgment in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District
of Wisconsin for $205,803.19.

M . JusTicE BREWER,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
That which attracts notice on even a casual reading of the
bill -the truth of all the allegations in which must be taken,
upon this record, to be admitted by the demurrer -is
the
fact that, while Angle was actively engaged in executing a
contract which he had with the Portage Company -a contract whose execution had proceeded so far that its successful
completion within the time necessary to secure to the Portage
Company its land grant was assured, and when neither he nor
the Portage Company was moving or had any disposition to
break that contract or stop the work - through the direct and
active efforts of the Omaha Company the performance of that
contract was prevented, the profits which Angle would have
received from a completion of the contract were lost to him,
and the land grant to the Portage Company was wrested
from it.
Surely it would seem that the recital of these facts would
carry with it an assurance that there was some remedy which
the law would give to Angle and the Portage Company for
the losses they had sustained, and that such remedy would
reach to the party, the Omaha Company, by whose acts these
losses were caused.
That there were both wrong and loss is beyond doubt. And,
as said by Croke, J., in Baiy v. Merrell, 3 Bulst. 91, 95,
"damage without fraud gives no cause of action; but where
these two do concur and meet together, there an action lieth."

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. lRAILWAY.

11

Opinion of the Court.

The Portage Company held a land grant worth four millions
of dollars. It had contracted for the construction of its road,
such construction to be completed in time to perfect its title
to the land. The contract had been so far executed that its
full completion within the time prescribed was assured. The
contractor had sixteen hundred men employed. The rails had
been purchased. The company had lifted itself out of the
embarrassments which years before had surrounded it. It had
taken up all its old sfock but $25,000, which was ignorantly
or wrongfully withheld by one of its officers. It had issued
one million of new stock, had authorized a new issue of bonds,
and had arranged for the cancelling of all its obligations with
seven hundred thousand of these bonds and one million of
stock. It had consummated arrangements with a wealthy
company for the advancement of moneys sufficient for its
work, and had gone so far as to place in the hands of that
company one hundred thousand of its bonds, upon which
$50,000 in cash was to be advanced. Except through some
wrongful interference, it was reasonably certain that everything would be carried out as thus planned and arranged.
At this time the Omaha Company, which was a rival in
some respects, and which had located a line parallel and contiguous to the line of the Portage Company, interferes, and
interferes in a wrongful way. It bribes the trusted officers
of the Portage Company to transfer the entire outstanding
stock into its hands, or at least place it under its control.
Being thus the only stockholder, it induces the general manager
to withdraw the several engineering corps, whose presence
was necessary for the successful carrying on of the work of
constructing the road; to give such notice as to result in the
seizure of all the tools and supplies of the contractor and the
company, and the dispersion of all laborers employed. To
prevent any action by the faithful officers of the Portage
Company, it wrongfully obtains an injunction tying their
hands. In the face of this changed condition of affairs the
company, which had negotiated with the Portage Company
and was ready to advance it money, surrendered the one
hundred thousand of the bonds, and abandoned the arrange-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

meat. By false representations to the legislature as to the
facts of the case, it persuaded that body to revoke the grant
to the Portage Company and bestow the lands upon itself.
That this was a wrongful interference on the part of the
Omaha Company, and that it resulted directly in loss to the
contractor and to the Portage Company, is apparent, It is
not an answer to say that there was no certainty that the
contractor would have completed his contract, and so earned
these lands for the Portagb Company. If such a defence were
tolerated, it would always be an answer in case of any wrongful interference with the performance of a contract, for there
is always that lack of certainty. It is enough that there
should be, as there was here, a reasonable assurance, considering all the surroundings, that the contract would be performed
in the manner and within the time stipulated, and so performed
as to secure the land to the company.
It certainly does not lie in the mouth of a wrongdoer, in the
face of such probabilities as attend this case, to say that perhaps the contract would not have been completed even if no
interference had been had, and that, therefore, there being no
certainty of the loss, there is no liability.
Neither can it be said that the Omaha Company had a right
to contend for these lands; that it simply made an effort,
which any one might make, to obtain the benefit of this land
grant. No rights of this kind, whatever may be their extent,
justify such wrongs as were perpetrated by the Omaha Company. Here, bribery was resorted to to induce the trusted
officers of the Portage Company to betray their trust, and to
place at least the apparent ownership of the stock in the hands
of the rival company.
Without notice, without hearing, and by false allegations,
it secured an injunction to stay the hands of the honest officers
of the Portage Company. Such wrongful use of the powers
and processes of the court cannot be recognized as among the
legitimate means of contest and competition. It burdens the
whole conduct of the Omaha Company with the curse of
wrongdoing, and makes its interference with the affairs of the
Portage Company a wrongful interference.

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

13

Opinion of the Court.

Further, by false representations as to what the Portage
Company has done and intends to do, it induced the legislature of the State to revoke the grant to the Portage Company
and bestow it upon itself. The result, and the natural result,
of these wrongful actions on the part of the Omaha Company
was the breaking down of the Portage Company, the disabling
it from securing the means of carrying on this work, the dispersion of the laborers, and the prevention of the contractor
from completing his contract. It will not do to say that the
contractor was not bound to quit the work, but might have
gone on and completed his contract, and thus earned the lands
for the Portage Company; nor that the wrongful act of the
trusted officers of the Portage Company in betraying their
trust could have been corrected by the Portage Company by
appropriate suit in the courts; that the law in one shape or
another would have offered redress to the Portage Company
for all the wrongs that were attempted and done by the
Omaha Company. Granting all of this, yet the fact remains
that the natural, the intended, result of these wrongful acts
was the breaking down of the Portage Company, the unwillingness of the foreign company to furnish it with money, and
the prevention of the contractor from completing his contract.
It is not enough to say that other remedies might have existed and been resorted to by the Portage Company, and that
notwithstanding the hands of its officers were tied by this
wrongful injunction. It is enough that the Portage Company
did break down; that it broke down in consequence of these
wrongful acts of the Omaha Company, and that they were
resorted to by the latter with the intention of breaking it
down.
It has been repeatedly held that, if one maliciously interferes
in a contract between two parties, and induces one of them to
break that contract to the injury of the other, the party injured can maintain an action against the wrongdoer: Green
v. Button, 2 Cr. Mees. & R. 707, in which the defendant, by
falsely pretending to one party to a contract that he had a
lien upon certain property, prevented such party from delivering it to the plaintiff, the other party to the contract, and was

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

held responsible for the loss occasioned thereby. Lumley v.
6ye, 2 El. & BI. 216, in which a singer had entered into a contract to sing only at the theatre of the plaintiff, and the defendant maliciously induced her to break that contract, and was
held liable to the damages sustained by the plaintiff in consequence thereof. Bowen v. Hall, 6 Q. B. D. 333, 337, in which
it was held that an action lies against a third person who maliciously induces another to break his contract of exclusive
personal service with an employer, which thereby would naturally cause, and did in fact cause, an injury to such employer.
In the opinion of Brett, L. J., it was said "that wherever a
man does an act which in law and in fact is a wrongful act,
and such an act as may, as a natural and probable consequence
of it, produce injury to another, and which in the particular
case does produce such an injury, an action on the case will
lie. This is the proposition to be deduced from the case of
Ashby v. TFkite. If these conditions are satisfied, the action
does not the less lie because the natural and probable consequence of the act complained of is an act done by a third person; or because such act so done by the third person is a
breach of duty or contract by him, or an act illegal on his
part, or an act otherwise imposing an actionable liability on
him." TFralker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555, in which a manufacturer was held entitled to maintain an action against a
third party who, with the unlawful purpose of preventing him
from carrying on his business, wilfully induced many of his
employs to leave his employment, whereby the manufacturer
lost their services, and the profits and advantages which he
would have derived therefrom. Benton v. Pratt, 2 Wend.
385. Rice v. Manley, 66 N. Y. 82, in which a party had contracted to sell and deliver to plaintiffs a quantity of cheese,
but having been made to believe through the fraud of the
defendant that the plaintiffs did not want the cheese, sold and
delivered it to him, and it was held that an action could be
maintained against the defendant for the damages which the
plaintiffs sustained from failing to get the cheese. Jones v.
Stanly, 76 IN. 0. 355, 356, in which the court said: "It was
decided in HasTlins v. Royster, 70 N. 0. 601, that if a person

Opinion of the Court.

maliciously entices laborers or croppers to break their contracts with their employer and desert his service, the employer may recover damages against such person. The same
reasons cover every case where one person maliciously persuades another to break any contract with a third person. It
is not confined to contracts for service."
Under these authorities, if the Omaha Company had by its
wrongful conduct simply induced the Portage Company to
break its contract with Angle, it would have been liable to him
for the damages sustained thereby. A fortiori,when it not
only induces a breach of the contract by the Portage Company,
but also disables it from performance.
But there is still another aspect in which these transactions
may be regarded. The Omaha Company became by its
wrongful acts the sole stockholder in the Portage Company.
It matters not that it might have been dispossessed of this
position by appropriate action in the courts. It was, for the
time at least, the sole stockholder. As such sole stockholder,
it took advantage of its position and its power to strip the Portage Company of its property and secure its transfer to itself.
Now, "what rights, if any, a corporation may have against a
sole stockholder who wrongfully causes the transfer of all the
property of the corporation to be made to himself, need not be
inquired into. It is clear that this stockholder cannot secure
this transfer from the corporation to itself of the property of
the latter so as to deprive a creditor of the corporation of the
payment of his debt.
To put it in another way: The Portage Company, a corporation, owed Angle $200,000. It had property with which
that debt could be paid. The Omaha Company became the
sole stockholder in the Portage Company. As such sole stockholder, it used its powers to transfer the property of the Portage Company to itself, and its conduct all the way through
was marked by wrongdoing.
Whatever the Portage Company might do, Angle may
rightfully hold the sole stockholder responsible for that payment, which the corporation would have made but for the
wrongful acts of such stockholder.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

But the stress of the defendant's contention is not that the
bill fails to state a case of wrong for which, generally speaking, the law would give a remedy, but that the action of the
legislature of the State in revoking the land grant to the
Portage Company and donating it to the Omaha Company is
conclusive upon the courts, and prevents any recovery; and,
secondly, that although actionable wrong on the part of the
defendant may be disclosed by the bill, the only remedy which
the plaintiff has therefor is an action at law for damages,
and no grounds are shown for the interposition of a court of
equity.
With respect to the first of these matters, it is insisted that
the Portage Company was in default at the very time that
these wrongs, on the part of the Omaha Company, were
charged to have been committed and the act of forfeiture
was passed. By section 8 (the granting section) of the act of
March 4, 1874, it was provided: "This grant is made upon
the express condition that said company shall construct, complete, and put in operation that part of its said railway above
mentioned, as soon as a railway shall be constructed and put
in operation from the city of Hudson to said point of intersection, and within five years from its acceptance of said lands
as herein provided, and shall also construct and put in operation the railway of said company from Genoa northerly, at
the rate of twenty miles per year." The act of March 16,
1878, reads that "the time limited for the construction of the
,ailway

.

.

is hereby extended three years."

It is said

that this act in effect merely struck out the word "five" in
the clause quoted, and substituted therefor the word "eight,"
leaving the other conditions of the grant unchanged. It is not
claimed in the bill that the Portage Company had ever constructed any part of its road from Genoa northward, or that a
railway had not been constructed and put in operation from
the city of Hudson to the point of intersection, and, therefore,
it is urged that it is not shown that the Portage Company was
not in default or that the legislature had not the absolute
right to forfeit, as it did, by the act of February 16, 1882. It
is contended, on the other hand, by the plaintiff that the ex-

tension was an absolute extension of three years from May 5,
1879, irrespective of the other two conditions in the original
grant, and gave to the Portage Company an interest in the
land grant which the legislature had no power to take away
before May 5, 1882. It is further insisted by the defendant
that, even if this claim of the plaintiff be sustained, the act of
March 5, 1883, confirming the revocation and resumption of
the land grant to the Portage Company, and the regranting
of the same to the Omaha Company, was after the expiration
of the full limit of extended time as thus claimed by the plaintiff, and that then the Portage Company had unquestionably
failed to earn the grant and had lost all right to the land.
Hence, it is said that there was, in whatever aspect the matter
may be looked at, a valid resumption by the State of the grant
which it had made conditionally to the Portage Company and
a regrant of the lands to the Omaha Company; that the act
of the legislature cannot be questioned; that full knowledge
of all the situation must be presumed, and that no inquiry
is permissible as to the motives which actuated the legislature, it being presumed that everything which it did it did
rightly.
In this respect, the case of Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87,
130, is relied upon. In that case a purchase of a large body
of lands was made by James Gunn and others in the year
1795, from the State of Georgia, the contract for which was
made in the form of a bill passed by the legislature. The
title to some of these lands thus acquired passed by conveyances to Peck, who conveyed them to Fletcher. An action
was brought on certain covenants in that deed. The third
covenant was that all the title which the State of Georgia
ever had in the premises had been legally conveyed to Peck,
The second count assigned, as a breach of
the grantor.
this covenant, that the original grantees from the State of
Georgia promised and assured divers members of the legislature, then sitting in general assembly, that if the said members
would assent to, and vote for the passing of the act, and if
the said bill should pass, such members should have a share
of, and be interested in all the lands purchased from the said
VOL. Cii-2

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

State by virtue of such law. And that divers of the said
members, to whom the said promises were made, were unduly
influenced thereby, and, under such influence, did vote for the
passing of the said bill; by reason whereof the said law was
a nullity, etc., and so the title of the State of Georgia did not
pass to the said Peck. In respect to this matter the court,
by Chief Justice Marshall, observed, among other things, as
follows:
"This is not a bill brought by the State of Georgia to annul
the contract, nor does it appear to the court by this count
that the State of Georgia is dissatisfied with the sale that has
been made. The case, as made out in the pleadings, is simply
this: One individual who holds lands in the State of Georgia,
under a deed covenanting that the title of Georgia was in the
grantor, brings an action of covenant upon this deed, and
assigns, as a breach, that some of the members of the legislature were induced to vote in favor of the law, which constituted
the contract, by being promised an interest in it, and that
therefore the act is a mere nullity.
"This solemn question cannot be brought thus collaterally
and incidentally before the court. It would be indecent in
the extreme, upon a private contract between two individuals,
to enter into an inquiry respecting the corruption of the
sovereign power of a State. If the title be plainly deduced
from a legislative act, which the legislature might constitutionally pass, if the act be clothed with all the requisite forms
of a law, a court, sitting as a court of law, cannot sustain a
suit brought by one individual against another founded on the
allegation that the act is a nullitr in consequence of the
impure motives which influenced certain members of the legislature which passed the law."
The rule upon which this decision rests has been followed
in many cases and has become a settled rule of our jurisprudence. The rule, briefly stated, is that whenever an act of
the legislature is challenged in court the inquiry is limited to
the question of power, and does not extend to the matter of
expediency, the motives of the legislators, or the reasons which
were spread before them to induce the passage of the act.

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

19

Opinion of the Court.

This principle rests upon the independence of the legislature
as one of the coiirdinate departments of the government. It
would not be seemly for either of the three departments to
be instituting an inquiry as to whether another acted wisely,
intelligently, or corruptly. Upon that rule it is insisted that
these two acts of the State of Wisconsin cannot be impeached;
that whatever wrongs may in fact have been done by the
Omaha to the Portage Company, the legislature of Wisconsin,
in the exercise of its undoubted power, has taken away the
lands from the Portage and given them to the Omaha Coi-'
pany, and, as its power is undoubted, no court can interfere
or inquire as to why or under the influence of what motives
or information those acts were passed; nor can any court
decree, either directly or indirectly, that those lands which
were taken away from one company and given to the other,
either legally or equitably, still remain the property of the
first company, and subject to the payment of its debts.
But it must be remembered that the wrongs of the Omaha
Company were done before the legislature passed either the
act of 1882 or that of 1883, and it is to redress those wrongs
that this suit was brought. Can it be that the legislature,
by passing those acts, condoned the wrongs, and relieved
the Omaha from any liability to the Portage Company? iDid
the resumption of the land grant and the regrant to the
Omaha Company make lawful its acts in bribing the officers
of the Portage Company? Did it relieve the Omaha Company from any liability for the wrongful use of the process
of the courts in the injunction? Could it act judicially and
in effect decree that the wrongs done by the one company
to the other created no cause of action? A right of action
to recover damages for an injury is property, and has a legislature the power to destroy such property? An executive
may pardon and thus relieve a wrongdoer from the punishment the public exacts for the wrong, but neither executive
nor legislature can pardon a private wrong or relieve the
wrongdoer from civil liability to the individual he has wronged.
The wrong was not one done by the State or in the act of the
legislature in taking away the land grant, but in such proceed-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

ings on the part of the Omaha Company as put the Portage
Company in a position which apparently called for the action
of the legislature. There is no more challenge of the validity
of this legislation by suing the Omaha Company for the
wrongs it did leading up to this legislation than there is in
challenging the validity of a criminal proceeding by an action
against the prosecutor for malicious prosecution. It may be,
as counsel claim, that the legislature is presumed to act with
full knowledge of the situation; that it knew of the wrongs
'done by the Omaha to the Portage Company; knew that
those wrongs had disabled the Portage Company from proceeding with the work; knew that thereby a cause of action
had arisen to the contractor, Angle, against the Portage
Company, and also against the Omaha Company; and with
all that knowledge in possession deliberately passed the statutes
referred to, and yet it does not follow that its legislation was
intended or was potent to relieve the Omaha Company from
liability. There is in this suggestion no impugning the
motives, the wisdom, or the power, of the legislature. It acts
as the guardian of the public interests, to which all private
interests must yield, and it may well have thought that, notwithstanding the wrong that bad been done by the Omaha
Company, the fact was obvious that the Portage Company
had become disabled, and could not go on with the work;
and that in subserviency to such public interest it was
necessary that the grant be taken away from the former and
given to the latter company, in order thus to expedite the
construction. As the courts will not interfere with the action
of the legislature, so it may rightfully be presumed that the
legislature never intends to interfere with the action of the
courts, or to assume judicial functions to itself. It may be
presumed to have left to the courts the redress of the private
wrongs done by the Omaha Company. In other words, it
may have acted upon considerations like these: Public interest
requires the speedy building of this road; the Portage Company cannot build it, the Omaha Company can if aided by
this grant; therefore, the public interests demand a taking
away of the grant from the one company and giving it to the

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

21

Opinion of the Court.

other. If the disabled condition of the Portage Company
has been brought about, by the wrongs of the Omaha Company, the courts are open, and the accepted maxim in those
tribunals is, that where there is a wrong there is a remedy.
It thus subserves the interests of the public and leaves the
redress of the wrong to that department which has not only
the requisite jurisdiction, but also the appropriate machinery
for ascertaining the amount of the injury, and enforcing the
due compensation.
Look at this from the opposite standpoint: When this matter was brought to the attention of the legislature, and its
action invoked, was it confronted with only these alternatives?
Must it, even if it could, as a condition of subserving the
public interests, condone the private wrong done by the one
company to the other, or must it let the public interests be
neglected until such time as the question of private wrong has
been determined, or must it, without the possession of the
suitable machinery for investigation, arbitrarily determineas a condition of this transfer in subservience to public interests -the measure of injury done by the one company to the
other, and the amount and character of the compensation to
be rendered? Large and unnecessary stress would be laid
upon the legislature if the question of public interest was
always to be thus hampered by suggestions of injury and compensation between private individuals. While if there be no
such stress, abundant freedom of action is open to the legislature, the distinction between the separate functions of the
co~irdinate departments of the government is preserved, and
at the same time public interest and private justice may be
secured. The legislature may proceed with sole regard in all
its actions to the public interests, with the assurance that all
questions of wrong and loss between individuals will be settled
in the judicial department, and that its own action in subserviency to the public interest will bar no redress of a private
wrong unless such bar be absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of the public interest.
But it is said that to permit this suit to be maintained, and
to subject these lands in the possession of the Omaha Corn-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

pany to the satisfaction of the judgment against the Portage
Company, is, pro tanto, to nullify the.action of the legislature;
that in taking the lands away from the one company and giving them to the other, it intended that the transfer should be
absolute, without limitation, and subject to no contingencies
or burdens. But it affirmatively expressed no such intention;
it simply made the transfer, leaving the property subject to
all the burdens and contingencies which might arise in the
ordinary course of law. Suppose at the time of this transfer
from the one company to the State, and from the State to the
other company, there was an existing judgment in favor of
the Portage against the Omaha Company, would it be for a
moment contended that there was anything in the transfer
which prevented the Portage Company from satisfying its
judgment by a seizure and sale of the lands thus transferred
to the Omaha Company? Unless there were in the words of
the grant to the Omaha Company something which expressly
tied up that land, it passed to the company, subject to seizure
and sale in satisfaction of any of its past or future obligations.
Even if it be conceded that, under a true construction of the
grant, taken in connection with the act extending the time
for three years, the Portage Company was in default on February 16, 1882, and the legislature had then the absolute right
to forfeit the grant, such concession would be no answer to
the cause of action set out in the bill. For who can say that
the legislature would have exercised that right of forfeiture ?
The mere fact that the Portage Company could not enforce
at the time a legal right to the lands as against the State does
not absolve the Omaha Company from liability for those wrongs
which resulted in putting the Portage Company in a condition
naturally calling for legislative action in furtherance of the
public interest. If nothing of the kind had been done by the
Omaha Company, and the Portage Company was, as it is
stated, proceeding diligently in the work, with reasonable
assurance that it would be completed within three or four
months, it is fair to presume that the legislature would not
have disturbed the grant, but would have permitted the Portage Company to fully earn that which it had already partially

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &o. RAILWAY.

23

Opinion of the Court.

earned. The selection of the Portage Company in the first
instance was, of course, made by the legislature in good faith,
and the time was extended with the intent that the Portage
Company should do the work and have the grant, and if the
legislature saw that the company was doing the work and
would have it promptly completed, respect for the good faith
of the legislature compels the conclusion that but for the
untoward circumstances precipitated upon the Portage Company by the wrongful acts of the Omaha Company the act of
February 16, 1882, would never have been passed. Assuredly
it does not lie in the power of the wrongdoer, the party whose
wrongs created that condition which induced the legislative
forfeiture, to excuse its wrongs on the ground that the legislature had the power to forfeit, and might have done it anyway. The cases of Benton v. Pratt,2 Wend. 385, 390, and Rice
v. Manley, 66 N. Y. 82, 85, are suggestive upon this question.
In the former of these cases it appeared that certain parties had
contracted with the plaintiff to purchase of him twenty hogs,
to be delivered at a future day, nothing having been done to
make the contract binding under the statute of frauds. While
the plaintiff was driving his hogs and preparing to fulfil his
6ontract, the defendants, knowing the facts, fraudulently represented that he did not intend to deliver them, and thus
induced those third parties to buy their hogs, and when the
plaintiff arrived with his they refused to take them simply
because they had already a full supply. The point was made
that the plaintiff could not recover because there was no binding contract between him and the third parties, but the point
was overruled, the court saying: "It was not material whether
the contract of the plaintiff with Seagraves & Wilson was
binding upon them or not, the evidence established beyond all
question that they would have fulfilled it but for the false and
fraudulent representations of the defendants." And in the
latter case the plaintiffs had made an agreement with one
Stebbins to purchase from him a quantity of cheese, to be
delivered at a future day, and that contract, too, was not
binding by reason of the statute of frauds. The defendant
knowing of this, fraudulently, by means of a fictitious tele-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

gram, persuaded Stebbins that the plaintiffs did not want the
cheese and would not take it, and thus himself secured a purchase of it. Here, too, it was objected, in defence to an action
against him for the damages caused by a failure on the part
of the plaintiffs to obtain the cheese from Stebbins, that there
was no contract which could be enforced against Stebbins for
the sale and delivery of the cheese, but the court overruled the
objection, saying: "Plaintiffs' actual damage is certainly as
great as it would have been if Stebbins had been obliged to
perform his contract of sale, and greater, for the reason that
they cannot indemnify themselves for their loss by a suit
against Stebbins to recover damages for a breach of the contract. Suppose a testator designed to give A a legacy, and
was prevented from doing it solely by the fraud of B; in such
case, while A has no right to the legacy which he can enforce
against the estate of the testator, yet both law and equity will
furnish him appropriate relief against B, depending upon the
facts of the case. (Kerr on Frauds, 274, and cases cited;
Bacon Ab. Fraud, B.) Suppose A made a parol contract with
B for the purchase of land, and B is ready and willing to convey, but is prevented from so doing by the fraudulent representations of C as to A, by which B is deceived and
induced to convey to C; in such case, although A could not
have compelled B to give him the conveyance, it would be a
reproach to the law to hold that C would not be liable to A
for the damage caused by the fraud." The same line of
thought applies to the case before us. While it cannot be
affirmed with certainty that the legislature would not have
passed the act of forfeiture, yet it is reasonable to presume
that it would not, and that its act was induced by the situation
of the Portage Company, which situation was brought about
by the wrongful acts of the Omaha Company.
Our conclusions in respect to this matter may be summed
up thus: The Portage Company would have completed the
work but for the wrongful acts of the Omaha Company. In
consequence of the disability thus caused, and also moved by
the false representations of the Omaha Company, the legislature resumed its grant and made a regrant to the Omaha

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RILWAY.

25

Opinion of the Court.

Company. The validity of that act is conceded. It is to be
presumed the legislature acted with proper regard to the
public interests, and without any improper motives or inducements. Conceding all this, it is equally to be presumed that
it left the redress of private wrongs to the judicial department. It attached no conditions to the grant to the Omaha
Company which would prevent the appropriation of those
lands to the satisfaction of any claims against that company.
And hence to hold the Omaha Company as trustee for the
creditors of the Portage Company, in respect to these lands,
neither impeaches the validity of the action of the legislature
nor casts any imputation upon its knowledge or motives. It
may also be noticed that the purpose of this grant, from
Congress in the first place and from the State to the companies in the second place, was to aid in the construction of
the railroad. That purpose having already been accomplished,
there is no thwarting public policy, or the purposes of the
grant, if the lands granted shall now be appropriated, through
the processes of the courts, to the satisfaction of any claims
against the Omaha Company.
Passing now to the other of the two objections, it may be
conceded that an action at law would lie for the damages
sustained by the Portage Company, through the wrongful
acts of the Omaha Company. Indeed, that is a fact which
underlies this whole case. Yet, while an action at law would
lie, it does not follow that such remedy was either full or
adequate. Waiving the question as to the solvency of the
Omaha Company, and assuming that any judgment against it
for damages could be fully satisfied by legal process, there
remains the proposition that it is contrary to equity that the
defendant should be permitted to enjoy unmolested that par-'
ticular property, the possession of which it sought to secure,
and did in fact secure, by its wrongful acts. Ought the Portage Company to be compelled to experiment with the solvency of the Omaha Company before coming into a court of
equity? While no express trust attached to the title to these
lands, either in the Portage or in the Omaha Company, while it may be conceded that when the legislature resumed

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the grant it took the title discharged of any express trust or
liability in favor of the creditors of the Portage Company,
and might have transferred an absolute title to any third
party beyond the reach or pursuit of the Portage Company,
or its creditors,- yet it is still true that the lands were given
to the Portage Company, as they had been given by Congress
to the State in the first instance for the purpose of aiding in
the construction of this road; that a part of the work necessary for such construction had been done, and there is, therefore, an equity in securing, to the extent to which the work
had been done, the application of these lands in payment
thereof. And when the Omaha Company, by its wrongdoings, secured the full legal title to those lands, equity will
hold that the party who has been deprived of payment for
his work from the Portage Company, by reason of their
having been taken away from it, shall be able to pursue those
lands into the hands of the wrongdoer, and hold them for the
payment of that claim which, but for the wrongdoings of the
Omaha Company, would have been paid by the Portage Company, partially at least, out of their proceeds. While no
express trust is affirmed as to the lands, yet it is familiar
doctrine that a party who acquires title to property wrongfully may be adjudged a trustee ex malefcio in respect to that
property.
In Pomeroy Eq. Jur. § 155, the author says, citing many
cases: "If one party obtains the legal title to property, not
only by fraud or by violation of confidence or of fiduciary
relations, but in any other unconscientious manner, so that he
cannot equitably retain the property which really belongs to
another, equity carries out its theory of a double ownership,
equitable and legal, by impressing a constructive trust upon
the property in favor of the one who is in good conscience
entitled to it, and who is considered in equity as the beneficial
owner." And again, in section 1053: "In general, whenever
the legal title to property, real or personal, has been obtained
through actual fraud, misrepresentations, concealments, or
through undue influence, duress, taking advantage of one's
weakness or necessities, or through any other similar means or

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

27

Harlan, J., Dissenting.

under any other similar circumstances which render it unconscientious for the holder of the legal title to retain and enjoy
the beneficial interest, equity impresses a constructive trust on
the property thus acquired in favor of the one who is truly
and equitably entitled to the same, although he may never perhaps have had any legal estate therein; and a court of equity
has jurisdiction to reach the property either in the hands of
the original wrongdoer, or in the hands of any subsequent
holder, until a purchaser of it in good faith and without
notice acquires a higher right, and takes the property relieved
from the trust. The forms and varieties of these trusts, which
are termed ex malefcio or ex delicto, are practically without
limit. The principle is applied wherever it is necessary for
the obtaining of complete justice, although the law may also
give the remedy of damages against the wrongdoer."
These authorities are ample to sustain this suit. The
property was in the Portage Company for the purpose of aiding in the construction of this road; work was done by the
plaintiff in that direction. Equity recognizes a right that that
property should be applied in the payment for that work.
The wrongdoing of the defendant, the Omaha Company, has
wrested the title to this property from the Portage Company
and transferred it to itself. It has become, therefore, a trustee
ex malesftio in respect to the property. It follows from these
considerations that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer
to this bill, and the decree of dismissal must be
Reversed, and the case remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrer, and for further proceedings in conformity to law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

"The Farmers Loan and Trust Company, a New York corporation, brings this suit in its capacity as trustee in a mortgage
or deed of trust executed January 1, 1881, by the Chicago,
Portage & Superior Railway Company, a corporation of Illinois and Wisconsin, having power to construct and equip a
railroad from the city of Chicago to a point on the north line
of the former State, at or near the village of Genoa, Wisconsin, thence by way of Portage to Superior, at the west end of
Lake Superior. The object of the mortgage was to secure
the payment of the principal and interest of negotiable bonds
which the railway company proposed to issue, to the amount
-of $10,200,000, and to that end it conveyed to the plaintiff, as
trustee, its entire road, together with all lands, land grants,
franchises, privileges, powers, rights, estate, title, interest, and
property belonging or appertaining thereto, including a certain
grant of lands made by the United States to the State of Wisconsin, and by the latter to the mortgagor company. The
mortgage authorized the trustee, upon default in the payment
of interest, to enter upon the premises, and also, in certain
contingencies, to sell the mortgaged property. It provided,
among other things, that the right of action under it shall be
vested exclusively in the plaintiff and its successors in trust,
and that under no circumstances should individual bondholders
institute a suit, action, or other proceeding, on or under the
mortgage, for the purpose of enforcing any remedy therein
provided.
"The bill shows that bonds to the amount of $5,000,000 were
executed, and a part of them issued and sold; and that, in
respect to the latter, the mortgagor company (which will be
,called the ' Portage Company ') was in default as to interest.
It is alleged that the defendant, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway Company, (which will be called the
'Omaha Company,') wrongfully claims to be the owner of
the lands granted by the State to the Portage Company, such
claim being founded upon enactments of the legislature of
Wisconsin which, the plaintiff avers, are unconstitutional, null,
and void. It is also alleged that even if said enactments vested
the legal title in the Omaha Company, the latter, for reasons

to be hereafter stated, ought not to be pewnitted by a court of
equity to hold the lands or their proceeds against the plaintiff and the creditors of the Portage Company. A decree is
asked declaring this mortgage or deed of trust to be a first
lien on the lands, including such as had been or might be certified to the State by the United States as indemnity lands
under the above grant.
"In connection with this general outline of the present suit,
it is necessary to state the history of these lands as disclosed
by the legislation of Congress and of this State.
"By an act of Congress, approved June 3, 1856, there was
granted to Wisconsin, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from Madison or Columbus, by the way
of Portage City, to the St. Croix river or lake, between townships 25 and 31, and from thence to the west end of Lake
Superior, and to Bayfield; and also from Fond du Lac, on
Lake Winnebago, northerly to the state line, every alternate
section of land, designated by odd numbers, for six sections in
width, within fifteen miles on each side of said road respectively; the lands to be held by the State, subject to the disposal
of the legislature, for no other purpose than the construction
of the road for which they were granted or selected, and disposed of only as the work progressed.
"The fourth section provided that the lands be disposed of
by the State only in manner following, - that is to say: that
a quantity not exceeding one hundred and twenty sections,
and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of the
roads, respectively, might be sold; and when the governor certified to the'Secretary of the Interior that any twenty continuous miles of either road were completed, then another like
quantity of the land granted might be sold; and so, from
time to time, until the roads were completed; and if they
'are not completed within ten years, no further sales shall be
made, and the land unsold shall revert to the United States.'

Harlan, J., Dissenting.

"'SE. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and
after its passage and publication.'
"It will be seen from the above statement that the grant in
the eighth section of the act of the Wisconsin legislature of
March 4, 1874, embraced so much of the lands granted by the
acts of Congress of June 3, 1856, and May 5, 1864, as were
applicable to the construction of the part of the road of the
Portage Company 'lying between the point of intersection of
the branches of said grants, as fixed by the surveys and maps
on file in the Land Office at Washington, and the west end of
Lake Superior,' - a distance of about sixty-five miles. That is
the road to which this suit relates.
"According to the most liberal construction of the act of
Mar.ch 4, 1874, and that of March 16, 1878, the time limited
for the completion of that road expired, at least, in May, 1882,
eight years after the railway company filed its bond, as required by the ninth section of the act of 1874. It is conceded
that the Portage Company never completed its land-grant division. Nor did it ever construct any part of the road from
Genoa northerly, as required by the act of 1874.
"The bill alleges that the Portage Company broke down in
the monetary panic of 1873-4, under a large load of debts
and embarrassments, and lay dormant until late in the year
1880, when its stockholders employed one Gaylord to find
parties able and disposed to revive it and put it on the way of
success; that the work of its rehabilitation had so far progressed
that in the fall of 1881, and early in 1882, the company borrowed large sums of money and expended them in pushing the
construction of the land-grant division in which it was interested; that, on the 19th of January, 1882, more than one-half
of the substructure of that division had been completed; that
at the time last named more than sixteen hundred men were at
work upon it, and its construction, in ample time to lay the
rails and complete the division before May 5, 1882, was assured.
"It is further alleged that the Portage Company would
have completed its land-grant road but for the following
causes: 1. The passage by the state legislature of the act of
February 16, 1882, revoking and annulling the grant contained

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

in the act of March 4, 1874, which destroyed the credit of the
company while it was actively engaged, under many disadvantages, in the construction of its road. 2. That the Omaha
Company, its agents and emissaries, interfered with and
defeated the efforts of the Portage Company to complete
its road within the required time.
"Although the act of June 3, 1856, provided that if the
roads therein named were not completed within ten years no.
further sales should be made, and the lands unsold should
revert to the United States; and although the only extension
of the period for such completion ever made by Congress was
for five years from and after the passage of the act of May 5,
1864, no question is made in the present suit as to the title of
these lands being in the State at the date of the passage of. the
act of March 4, 1874, for all the purposes indicated in the acts
of Congress. This, perhaps, is because of the decision in Schulenberg v. Harriman, 21 Wall. 44, 64, in which the court had
occasion to interpret the acts of June 3, 1856, and May 5,
1864; holding that the requirement that the lands remaining
unsold after a specified time shall revert to the United States,
if the road be not then completed, was nothing more than
'a provision that the grant shall be void if a condition subsequent be not performed;' that when a grant upon condition
subsequent proceeds from the government, no individual can
assail the title upon the ground that the grantee has failed to
perform such condition; and that the United States having
taken no action to enforce the forfeiture of the estate granted,
'the title remained in the State as completely as it existed on
the day when the title by location of the route of the railroad
acquired precision, and became attached to the adjoining alternate sections.' See also _ckfilckea v. United States, 97 U. S.
204, 217; Grinnell v. Railroad Company, 103 U. S. 739,
744; -Fan T yol v. Enevals, 106 U. S. 360, 368; St. Louis,
Iron Mountain &o. Railway v. .M'oGee, 115 U. S. 469, 473.
These authorities also indicate the mode in which the right to
take advantage of the non-performance of a condition subsequent, annexed to a public grant, may be exercised, namely,
by judicial proceedings authorized by law, the equivalent of

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

37

Harlan, J., Dissenting.

an inquest of office at common law, finding the fact of forfeiture, or adjudging the restoration of the estate on that ground,'
or by 'legislative assertion of ownership of the property for
breach of the condition, such as an act directing the possession
and appropriation of the property, or that it be offered for
sale or settlement.'
"The questions to which the attention of the court has been
principally directed relate, more or less, to the act of February 16, 1882, revoking and annulling the grant to the Portage Company. The main contention of that company is that
the grant of 1874, the acceptance thereof, and the bond given
for the performance of the condition as to the construction of
the land-grant division, constituted a contract, entitling it to
earn the lands by completing the sixty-five miles of railway,
to the west end of Lake Superior, by May 5, 1882, without
opposition or hindrance on the part of the State; consequently,
it is argued, the forfeiture declared by the act of 1882 impaired -the obligation of that contract, and was unconstitutional and void.
"On the part of the Omaha Company it is contended that
one of the conditions of the grant to the Portage Company
was that it would construct and put in operation its road from
Genoa northerly at the rate of twenty miles each year; that
no part of that road had been constructed when the act of
1882 was passed; and that, by reason of such default, the
State had the right to withdraw the grant from the latter
company, without regard to what had or had not been done
towards the construction of its land-grant division. To this
the plaintiff replies that the obligation which the Portage
Company assumed with reference to its road from Genoa
northerly was not made, nor intended to be made, a condition
of its right to earn the lands applicable to that part of the
road between the point of intersection of the Bayfield branch
with the branch extending to the west end of Lake Superior;
and that, consistently with the acts of Congress, the State
could not make the right to earn these lands depend upon the
construction of any part of its line, except that which Congress
intended to aid by the grant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

"It is also contended by the Omaha Company that the
grant to the Portage Company was beyond the power of the
State to make; that the mode in which the State disposed of
the lands to the latter company was inconsistent with that prescribed in the act of Congress, - that is, that the State had no
authority, in advance of the completion of the road, to dispose
of the land, by sale, conveyance, or otherwise, beyond one
hundred and twenty sections, or to make any additional contract in respect to their disposition. To this the plaintiff
replies that the act of 1864, by necessary implication, permitted the State to dispose of the lands, subject to the conditions of the grant, as to the time when the absolute title should
pass from the State to the corporation earning them, and as
to the time within which the road should be completed. Such,
it is claimed, was all that was done by the act of 1874.
"As will be seen from the views hereafter expressed touching other questions, it is not necessary to decide whether the
eighth section of the act of 1874 made the construction by the
Portage Company of its road from Genoa northerly a condition of the grant to it of these lands, or whether such a condition could have been legally imposed by the State. The
court is inclined to the opinion that if the Portage Company
had duly performed the condition prescribed as to the completion of its land-grant division, its right to the lands applicable to that division, and expressly set apart to aid in its
construction, would not have been affected by its failure to
construct the Genoa branch. But the decision will not be
placed upon that interpretation of the legislation in question.
" Nor will it be necessary to determine the other questions
above stated, nor the question as to the validity of the revocation contained in the act of February 16, 1882. For if it be
assumed that such revocation was a nullity, as impairing the
obligation of the alleged contract between the Portage Company and the State, especially because made before the expiration of the period limited for the completion of its road, and
while the company was engaged in constructing it; if the
mode in which the State disposed of the lands to the Portage
Company be conceded to have been consistent with the acts

AN GLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

39

Harlan, J., Dissenting.

of Congress; and if the authority of that company to mortgage the lands in order to raise money for the construction of
the road be admitted; still, there remain, in the way of granting the relief sought, these stubborn, indisputable facts:
"First. That no corporation could acquire, and, therefore,
could not pass, an interest in the lands, except subject to the
condition prescribed in the act of the state legislature as to
the time within which the land-grant division should be completed, and, therefore, subject to the right of the State, in
some appropriate mode, to resume its ownership and possession of the lands for any substantial failure to perform that
condition;
"Second. That the road was not constructed or completed
within the time prescribed by the acts of March 4, 1874, and
March 16, 1878;
" T14rd. That, after the expiration of that period, the revocation, annulment, and resumption declared by the act of
February 16, 1882, and the grant in the same act to the
Omaha Company, were in all things confirmed by the act of
March 5, 1883, which, besides, repealed the latter statute and
all previous acts interfering with or in any manner conflicting
with such act of confirmation.
"If the act of February 16, 1882, was a valid exercise of
power by the legislature, that, plainly, is an end of this branch
of the case. But if it was unconstitutional and void, upon any
ground whatever, its passage did not, in a legal sense, deprive
the Portage Company of the right to proceed with the work
of construction, and, by completing the road within the required time, become entitled to receive patents, or to compel
any corporation or persons to whom patents were wrongfully
issued to surrender the title. The validity and effect of the
confirmatory act of March 5, 1883, does not depend upon the
validity of the act of February 16, 1882; for if the latter act
was void, it was clearly within the power of the legislature,
by the act of 1883,-neither the road, nor any twenty continuous miles thereof, having at its date been completed by
the Portage Company, - to withdraw or annul the grant to
that company, and to make a new grant of the lands to

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

another corporation. The revocation in the act of March 5,
1883, of the grant to the Portage Company, accompanied by
a confirmation, in the same act, of the grant of the same lands
to the Omaha Company, was equivalent to a revocation, made,
for the first time, on that day, and to an affirmative grant,
then, for the first time, to that company. The passage by the
legislature, in 1882, of an act that was void did not prevent it
from passing a valid act, in 1883, touching the same subject.
In Strother v. Lucas, 12 Pet. 410, 454, it was said: 'That a
grant may be made by a law, as well as a patent pursuant to
law, is undoubted (6 Cranch, 128); and a confirmation by a
law is as fully, to all intents and purposes, a grant, as if it
contained in terms a grant de novo.' See also Field v. SeabuT, 19 How. 323, 334; -Langdeauv. lanes, 21 Wall. 521,
530; 87idell v. Grandjean, 111 U. S. 412, 439;- WhTiney v.
.Morrow, 112 U. S. 693, 695.
"It results from what has been said that, unless restrained
by some legal obligation or contract from revoking the grant to
the Portage Company, after the expiration of the time limited
for the completion of the road to the west end of Lake Superior, the power of the State to pass the act of March 5, 1883,
cannot be questioned. Were the hands of the State tied by
any such obligation or contract? It has already been said
that the mere revocation of February 16, 1882, if invalid, did
not put the State under any legal obligation to forbear the
exercise of any power it had after, and by reason of, the failure
of that company to complete its land-grant road within the
time stipulated.
"Assuming that the completion of the road, within the time
limited, was rendered impossible by the act annulling the grant
made to the Portage Company, it is contended that the case
comes within the familiar rule that 'where a condition subsequent be possible when made, and becomes impossible by act
of God or the king's enemy, or the law, or the grantor, the
estate, having once vested, is not thereby divested by the
failure, but becomes absolute,' citing Co. Litt. 206 a, 206 b; 4
Kent Com. 130; Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 230, 231. This rule
cannot be applied to the present case. It is not to be disputed

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &c. RAILWAY.

41

Harlan, J., Dissenting.

that the revocation of the grant to the Portage Company had
an injurious effect upon its credit. But, in a legal sense, such
revocation by an unconstitutional, void act of legislationwhich the plaintiff affirms the act of February 16, 1882, to be
-cannot
be said to have made impossible the performance of
the condition upon which the company's title to the lands
depended. The attempted revocation by the legislature, in
1882, and the loss by the company of credit in financial circles,
do not, in law, hold the relation of cause and effect. The
contrary view is not sustained by Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall.
203, 230. While the court there recognized the rule excusing
the performance of a condition subsequent where performance
was rendered impossible by the act of the law, or of the
grantor, it was alleged in the bill, and admitted by the demurrer, that the State, by plunging her people into civil war,
had herself prevented the railroad company from earning the
grant of lands made in aid of the construction of its road. A
condition of war, it was conceded, wholly precluded the completion of the road. But, even in that case, performance
within a reasonable time was held to be essential to any claim
to have the benefit of the grant. Here, there has not been
performance by the Portage Company in respect to any part
of its land-grant division. If the act of 1882 was void, and if,
despite its passage, the Portage Company had completed the
road within the required time, it would not be disputed by the
plaintiff that, as between the company and the State or any
other grantee of the State, the equitable title to lands would
have been in that company. Its misfortune - assuming the
representations as to its general financial condition to be true
was, that it had no credit of consequence except such as it
got from the State's grant of lands; a circumstance that cannot control the determination of the question whether the
act of 1882, in a legal sense, rendered it impossible to complete
the road in time. If this be not so, it would follow that the
act of 1882 would excuse or not excuse the failure of the Portage Company to complete the road within the time, as the
evidence was the one way or the other touching its financial
ability to have done so, apart from the credit given by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

grant of the lands in dispute. But the rule invoked by the
plaintiff surely does not rest upon such a shifting foundation.
Within that rule, the impossibility to perform a condition subsequent is either one arising from some obstacle interposed by
the grantor, actually precluding or preventing performance by
the grantee, or one that ensues, as matter of law, from something that the grantor did or caused to be done. There is no
claim of actual interruption by the officers or agents of the
State of the construction of the road; and, assuming the act
of 1882 to have been unconstitutional, it cannot be true, in
any legal sense, that non-performance of the condition, as to
the completion of the road within the prescribed time, resulted
from the mere passage of that act.
"It remains to consider other aspects of the case that have
been presented with marked ability by the counsel for the
plaintiff.
"It is contended, in substance, that the forfeiture of the land
grant was caused by false representations made to the legislature by the Omaha Company, which desired the transfer of
the grant to itself to aid in the construction of its own road,
and that that company by fictitious suits, and by corruptly
conspiring with officers of the Portage Company, wrongfully
and fraudulently prevented the latter company from performing the condition in respect to the time within which the road
was to be completed; consequently, the lands and their proceeds should be subjected by a court of equity to the debts of
the Portage Company, secured by its land mortgage. The
principal allegation of the bill as to what the Omaha Company
did is: ' Furthermore, it, and at its instance, others employed
by it, and especially the said A. A. Jackson and C. J. Barnes,
who were well known as officers of the Portage Company,
and understood to be authorized to speak in its behalf, falsely
represented to members of said legislature that the Portage
Company had made no substantial progress towards the construction of said land-grant division, and never had any considerable number of men at work thereon, and was wholly
without means or credit to prosecute said work; that it had
at last voluntarily and finally abandoned all attempt to con-

ANGLE v. CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &o. RAILWAY.

Harlan, T., Dissenting.

struct the same, and that it was willing to have the grant to
it forfeited and given to the Omaha Company; whereupon,
the legislature of Wisconsin, relying on these false representations, and without inquiry or hearing, hurriedly passed the act
of February 16, 1882, above named, to forfeit the said land
grant of the Portage Company and confer it on the Omaha
Company.'
"Undoubtedly the Omaha Company was both willing and
anxious that this land grant should be wrested from the Portage Company and transferred to itself; and to effect that
end it appeared by its agents before legislative committees
for the purpose of showing that the Portage Company did
not have the means or credit necessary to construct, and never
would construct, the road in question within the time fixed.
And it may be assumed, for the purposes of this case, that the
agents of the Omaha Company made representations as to the
condition of the other company that were not in all respects
consistent with the truth or with fair dealing. Still, the question arises, how is a judicial tribunal to ascertain the extent
to which the action of the legislative department in revoking
this grant was controlled or influenced by representations
made to its members by the Omaha Company about the other
company ? Can the courts, in any case, assume that the legislature was not fully informed, when it passed a statute relating to public objects, as to every fact essential to an intelligent
determination of the matters to which that statute relates?
Must it not be conclusively presumed thai in disposing of lands
held in trust for public purposes it was controlled entirely by
considerations of the public good, and not, in any degree, by
false representations of individuals having private ends to subserve, and having no special concern either for the general
welfare or for the rights of other individuals?
"These questions are all answered in numerous adjudged
cases, the leading one of which is Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch,
87, 130, 131. That was an action for breach of certain covenants in a deed made by Peck for lands embraced in a purchase
by Gunn and others from the State of Georgia, under an act
passed by the legislature of that State. One of the covenants

. OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Harlan, J., Dissenting.

alleged to have been broken was that all the title the State
ever had in the premises had been legally conveyed to Peck,
the grantor. It was assigned, in substance, as a breach of
that covenant that the act there in question was a nullity, and
-so the title of the State did not pass to Peck, because its passage was procured by corruption and undue influence used by
the original grantees from the State upon members of the
legislature. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court,
said:
"' That corruption should find its way into the governments
of our infant republics, and contaminate the very source of
legislation, or that impure motives should contribute to the
passage of a law, or the formation of a legislative contract, are
.circumstances most deeply to be deplored. How far a court
-of justice would in any way be competent, on proceedings
instituted by the State itself, to vacate a contract thus formed,
and to annul rights acquired under that contract by third
persons having no notice of the improper means by which it
was obtained, is a question which the court would approach
with much circumspection. It may well be doubted how far
the validity of a law depends upon the motives of its framers,
and how far the particular inducements operating on members
.of the supreme sovereign power of a State, to the formation
of a contract by that power, are examinable in a court of justice. If the principle be conceded that an act of the supreme
sovereign power might be declared null by a court, in conse,quence of the means which procured it, still would there be
difficulty in saying to what extent those means must be
applied to produce this effect. Must it be direct corruption?
or would interest or undue influence of any kind be sufficient?
Must the vitiating cause operate on a majority? or on what
number of the members? Would the act be null, whatever
might be the wish of the nation? or would its obligation or
nullity depend upon the public sentiment? If the majority of
the legislature be corrupted, it may well be doubted whether
it be in the province of the judiciary to control their conduct;
and, if less than a majority act from impure motives, the
principle by which judicial interference would be regulated is

brought by one individual against another, founded on the
allegation that the act is a nullity, in consequence of the
impure motives which influenced certain members of the legislature which passed the law.'
"It is true that there is no suggestion in the present case that
the act of revocation of February 16, 1882, was procured by
bribery or corruption practised upon members of the Wisconsin legislature. But the charge is that that body was induced
by false representations, made by the agents of the Omaha
Company, to do what they would not otherwise have done.
This difference in the facts does not make the principles
announced in Fletcher v. Peck inapplicable to the present
case; for, if an act of legislation cannot be impeached by
proof of corruption upon the part of those who passed it,
much less can it be made a matter of proof that legislators
were deceived or misled by false representations as to facts
involved in proposed legislation of a public character. The
principle upon which Fletcher v. Peck rests excludes all extrinsic evidence of witnesses as to the motives of legislators,
or as to the grounds of legislative action. In Eaxparte .McArdle, 7 Wall. 506, 514, the court said: 'We are not at
liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature. We
can only examine into its power under the Constitution.' In
Doyle v. Continental Insutrance Co., 94 U. S. 535, 541: ' If
the act done by the State is legal, is not in violation of the
Constitution or laws of the United States, it is quite out of
the power of any court to inquire what was the intention of
those who enacted the law.' So, in Soon ling v. Crowley,
113 U. S. 703, 710: 'The rule is general with reference to
the enactments of all legislative bodies, that the courts cannot inquire into the motives of the legislators in passing them,
except as they may be disclosed on the face of the acts, or
inferable from their operation, considered with reference to
the condition of the country and existing legislation. The

motives of the legislators, considered as the purposes they had
in view, will always be presumed to be to accomplish that
which follows as the natural and reasonable effect of their
enactments. Their motives, considered as the moral inducements for their votes, will vary with the different members
of the legislative body. The diverse character of such motives,
and the impossibility of penetrating into the hearts of men
and ascertaining the truth, preclude all such inquiries as
impracticable and futile.'
"It was well said by the Supreme Court of Michigan, in
Plank Road Conpany v. TW.oodull, 25 Michigan, 103: 'The
legislature will not only choose its own mode of collecting
information to guide its legislative discretion, but from due
courtesy to a coirdinate department of the government, we
must assume that those methods were the suitable and proper
ones, and that they led to correct results; and if the records
show no investigation, we must still presume that the proper
information was obtained, for we must not suppose the legislature to have acted improperly, unadvisedly, or from any
other than public motives, under any circumstances, when
acting within the limits of its authority.'
"To the same generaf effect are many other cases: Aldridge
v. Williams, 3 How. 24; A-faynard v. ]Hill, 125 U. S. 190,
209; Johnson v. Higgins, 3 Met. (Ky.) 566, 576; Sunbtry &
Erie Railroad v. Cooper, 33 Penn. St. 278, 283 ; Stark v. .McGowan, 1 Nott & McCord, 387, 400; People v. -Flagg,46
N. Y. 405; Wright v. Defrees, 8 Indiana, 298, 302; Jones v.
Jones, 12 Penn. St. 350, 357.
"For the reasons stated, evidence as to the falsity or truth
of the representations made by the Omaha Company, or its
agents, to the legislature, or to legislative committees, in
respect either of this land grant or of the Portage Company,
as well as evidence as to any efforts by the Omaha Company
to bring about the revocation of the grant made to the other
company, is immaterial to the present controversy. Such
evidence cannot be made the basis' of judicial determination
without entrenching upon the independence of a cordinate
department of the government, and impairing its right to

proceed, in the exercise of its functions, upon such information as it deems necessary. An adjudication as to rights
acquired by individuals under public enactments, based upon
an inquiry as to whether those individuals made false representations to the legislature, or as to whether the legislature
was probably influenced by such representations, is an indirect
interference with the power of the legislature, acting within
the limits of its authority, to enact such laws as it deems best
for the general good. The courts must, of necessity, presume
-whatever may be averred to the contrary -that no general
statute is ever passed either for want of information upon the
part of the legislature, or because it was misled by the false
representations of lobbyists or interested parties. They must
restrict their inquiries to the validity of such legislation. Such
is the established doctrine as to legislative enactments relating to public objects, although a different rule is recognized
by some courts in respect to private statutes alleged to have
been procured by fraud practised upon the legislature by those
claiming benefits under them.
"What has been said disposes of the suggestion that the dispersion of the force employed by the Portage Company in the
early part of the year 1882 in the construction of its road, the
suspension of the work of construction, and its inability to
raise the necessary funds for the completion of the road
within the time stipulated, was the result of the machinations
of agents of the Omaha Company, acting by its authority, and
of the corrupt conspiring by those agents with officers of the
Portage Company, whereby those officers neglected to do
towards the timely completion of the road what, in fidelity to
their employers, they might have done.
" Whether this arraignment of the Omaha Company is justified by the evidence, or whether the Portage Company could, in
its weak financial condition in 1882, have completed the road
within the required time, if its plans had not been interfered
with, in the manner stated, it is not necessary to determine.
For, as already indicated, if all that is said in respect to the
conduct of the Omaha Company were clearly established, the
settled principles of law forbid the court from assuming that

the legislative department of the State when it passed the act
of 1882, as well as the confirmatory act of 1883, was not in
possession of every fact affecting the justice of such legislation. These principles cannot be disregarded in order to
remedy the hardships of particular cases. If each member
of the legislature was aware when that act was passed of
everything which it is alleged was done by the Omaha Company in regard to this land grant and its rival company, and
yet in discharge of what it deemed a public duty, and in
order to secure the speedy completion of a public highway,
supposed to be imperatively required by the interests of their
constituents, the legislature passed the confirmatory act of
1883, and thereby selected the beneficiary of the grant made
by Congress in aid of the construction of that highway, the
conduct of the Omaha Company surely would not constitute
any ground why a court of equity should attempt to thwart
the wishes of the legislative department. That is precisely
what would be done if the court took from that company the
benefit of the grant deliberately made to it by the legislature
in aid of the construction of its road. Legislative enactments,
relating to public objects, so far as they confer rights upon
individuals, must stand, if they be constitutional, without any
attempt upon the part of the courts to conjecture or ascertain
what the members of the legislature would or would not have
done under any given state of facts established by extrinsic
evidence.
"It is further said, in behalf of the plaintiff, that the Omaha
Company became, as early as January and February, 1882,
the owner of every share of the capital stock of the Portage
Company, and of a large part of its bonded and floating indebtedness; that the former company built a road from M ud
Lake to Superior City, parallel to and a few yards from the
half-graded line of the latter company; and that the road so
built was such an one as was described in the acts of Congress
of 1856 and 1864. Upon these facts the plaintiffs rest the
contention, that as that road was constructed by a corporation
which was the sole stockholder and a principal creditor of the
Portage Company, and as the law avoids forfeitures where

practicable, the condition imposed by the State may be regarded as having been duly performed, within the rule that
' any one who is interested in a condition may perform it, and
when performed, it is gone forever;' citing 2 Crabbe's IReal
Prop. 815; 2 Washb. Real Prop. (2d ed.) 12, and other authorities.
"The court is unable to assent to this view, for the reason, if
there were no other, that what was done by the Omaha Company towards the construction of its road to Superior City
was not done by it as a stockholder and creditor of the Portage Company. It did not elect or intend, in that capacity, to
perform the condition imposed by the State upon the latter
company. The record conclusively establishes the fact that in
constructing the road to the west end of Lake Superior the
Omaha Company proceeded under its own charter, and represented its own stockholders, and not the stockholders of the
other company. It built its own branch road, and did not
complete the road commenced by the Portage Company. It
was so understood by the plaintiff; for it alleges in the bill that
' in the year 1882 the Omaha Company constructed its branch
to Superior City, alongside of the partially constructed line of
the Portage Company, and has ever since operated the same.'
And this is consistent with the second section of the act of
February 16, 1882, which made the grant to the Omaha Company upon the express condition that it would continuously
proceed with the construction of the road then 'in part constructed &y it between said point of intersection and the west
end of Lake Superior,' and complete it on or before December 1, 1882. It is impossible to suppose that the Omaha Company ever intended to perform the condition imposed upon
the Portage Company in reference to the latter's road. It
performed the condition imposed in the act granting these
lands in aid of the construction of its road. The plaintiff's
whole case proceeds upon the theory that the Omaha Company sought to prevent any result that would be beneficial to
the other company. It would, therefore, be a perversion of
the rule, upon which the plaintiff relies, and inconsistent
with the entire evidence, to say that the Omaha Company was

interested in performing, or intended to perform, or that the
State regarded it as performing, the condition in question for
or in behalf of the Portage Company. That would make the
Omaha Company do something for another corporation which
it did not elect to do, and was not in law bound to do.
" Many other questions have been discussed by the counsel
of the respective parties, about which the court forbears any
expression of opinion. Their determination is rendered unnecessary by the conclusions reached upon the principal
points."

FAMOUS SMITH v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE OIROUIT

COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.
No. 1003. Submitted November 15, 1893. -Decided January 0, 1894.
A Cherokee Indian being indicted in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the Western District of Arkansas for the murder of a white man, it
was set up in defence that the murdered man was also an Indian, and
that the court was therefore without jurisdiction. The evidence for the
defence showed that the murdered man was generally recognized as an
Indian, tirat his reputed father -was so recognized, and that he himself
was enrolled, and had participated in the payment of bread money to the
Cherokees. To offset this the government showed that he had not been
permitted to vote at a Cherokee election, but it also appeared that he had
not been in the district long enough to vote. Held,
(1) That the burden was on the prosecution to prove that he was a
white man;
(2) That the testimony offered by the government had no legitimate
tendency to prove that the murdered man was not an Indian.

Tins was a writ of error to review the conviction of the
plaintiff in error for the murder of one James Gentry, alleged
to have been "a white man and not an Indian," on August 1,
1883, in the Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory. The case
was tried before the Circuit Court of the United States for the
