UNITED STATES v. LA TOURRETTE.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 1087. Submitted January 22, 1894. -Decided

February 5, 1894.

A post chaplain in the Army of the United States, commissioned by the
President under the act of March 2, 1867, c. 145, § 7, is entitled, in computing his. longevity pay under the act of July 15, 1870, c. 294, § 24,
(Rev. Stat. § 1262,) to be credited with his service as a chaplain, employed by the officers composing the council of administration, at a
military post approved by the Secretary of War, under the act of July 5,
1838, c. 162, § 18, and the acts supplementary thereto.

THIS was a petition filed in the Court of Claims by James
A. M. La Tourrette, and prosecuted after his death by his
executrix, to recover the sum of $333.75, for longevity pay as
a chaplain in the Army from February 7, 1885, to April 26,
1887, inclusive. The facts found by the Court of Claims were
in substance as follows:
On February 6, 1865, the claimant was elected and appointed
chaplain for the post of Fort Columbus, New York Harbor,
by the council of administration at the post, under the provisions of the act of July 5, 1838, c. 162, § 18; and of the
supplementary acts of July 7, 1838, c. 194, § 2; March 2,
1849, c. 83, § 3; and February 21, 1857, c. 55, § 2. 5 Stat.
259, 308; 9 Stat. 351; 11 Stat. 163.
The action of the post council was approved by the Secretary of War; and the claimant's appointment or employment
as post chaplain was subsequently announced in a special
order of the War Department of May 19, 1866, as follows:
"Fort Columbus, New York Harbor, is announced as a
chaplain post, to date from February 6, 1865, in place of Fort
Wood, New York Harbor, discontinued as such from that
date. The Reverend James A. M. La Tourrette is announced
as post chaplain to Fort Columbus, New York Harbor, from
February 6, 1865. He will, in connection with his present
duties at Fort Columbus, perform also those of Fort Wood, as
heretofore."

UNITED STATES v. LA TOURRETTE.
Statement of the Case.

Under that appointment, he served until April 6, 1867; but
received no commission; it did not appear that he was required to take an oath of office ;'his employment was not for
any fixed or definite time; and he was paid for services on
the certificate of the post commander.
Under the provisions of the act of March 2, 1867, c. 145,
§ 7, (14 Stat. 423,) he was nominated by the President to the
Senate for appointment as post chaplain, March 18; confirmed
by the Senate, April 3; commissioned accordingly by the
President, April 6, to rank from April 3; and formally
accepted the appointment, April 27, 1867. On March 23,
1890, he was retired from active service as post chaplain,
under the act of June 30, 1882, c. 254. 22 Stat. 118.
His service as chaplain under the act of July 5, 1838, together with his service as post chaplain under the act of March
2, 1867, was continuous and uninterrupted from February 6,
1865, to March 23, 1890.
He was not borne on the Army Register before 1867. In
the registers from 1867 to 1878, inclusive, his name appears,
with the date of "original entry into service," April 3, 1867.
The registers from 1879 to 1881, inclusive, refer to that date
as "date of commission;" and these registers, as well as those
for 1882 and since, record the beginning of his service as chaplain of a post, February 6, 1865, and as post chaplain, April 3,
1867, accepted April 27, 1867.
From April 27, 1867, to March 23, 1890, he was paid his
salary, with longevity pay, computed for the most part by
crediting him with his service from February 6, 1865; but
since February 6, 1885, with his service from April 27, 1867,
only. If he is to receive credit for the time from February 6,
1865, to April 26, 1867, the longevity pay due him is the sum
of $333.75, more than he has received.
On these facts, the Court of Claims decided, as a conclusion
of law, "that the decedent, during his service from February
6, 1865, to April 26, 1867, was in the Army of the United
States, within the meaning of the law," and therefore entitled
to recover the sum claimed, and gave judgment accordingly.
The United States appealed to this court.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Dodge and .Mr. Charles C.
Binney for appellants.
Mr. Joseph W. Striker for appellee.
-MR. JuSTICE

GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
This claim for longevity pay is based on the provision of
the act of July 15, 1870, c. 294, § 24, reenacted in the Revised
Statutes, by which "there shall be allowed and paid to each
commissioned officer below the rank of brigadier-general,
including chaplains and others having assimilated rank or
pay, ten per centum of their current yearly pay for each term
of five years of service." 16 Stat. 320; Rev. Stat. § 1262.
"Service" in this statute evidently, as both parties admit,
means military service; and the question is whether the claimant was in that service from February 6, 1865, to April 26,
1867.
This question is best answered by reading the provisions of
previous acts of Congress, referred to by counsel, which are as
follows, the significant words being printed below in italics:
By the act of July 5, 1838, c. 162, § 18, "it shall be lawful
for the officers composing the council of administration at any
post, from time to time, to employ such person as they may
think proper to oficiate as chaplain, who shall also perform
the duties of schoolmaster at such post; and the person so
employed shall, on the certificate of the commanding officer of
the post, be paid such sumfor his services, not exceeding forty
dollars per month, as may be determined by the said council
of administration, with the approval of the Secretary of War;
and in addition to his pay, the said chaplain shall be allowed
four rations per diem with quarters andfuel." 5 Stat. 259.
By the supplementary act of July 7, 1838, c. 194, "theposts
at which chaplains shall be allowed shall be limited to the
number of twenty, and shall be first approvea by the Secretary
of War, and shall be confined to places most destitute of
instruction." 5 Stat. 308.
By the act of February 11, 1847, c. 8, § 7, " during the war

UNITED STATES v. LA TOURRETTE.
Opinion of the Court.

with Mexico, it shall be lawful for the officers composing the
councils of administration of the several regiments constituting
a brigade, either regular or volunteer, in the service of the
United States, to employ some proper person to officiate as
chaplain to such brigade:" " Provided that the chaplains
now attached to the regular army and stationed at different
militaryposts may, at the discretion of the Secretary of War,
be required to repair to the Army in Mexico whenever a majority of the men at the posts where they are respectively
stationed shall have left them for service in the field; and
should any of said chaplains refuse or decline to do this when
ordered so to do by the adjutant-general, the office of such
chaplain shall be deemed vacant, and thepay and emoluments
thereof be stopped." 9 Stat. 124.
By § 3 of the act of March 2, 1849, c. 83, entitled "An act
to provide for an increase of the medical staff, and for no
additional number of chaplains of the Army of the Uhnited
States," the provisions of the act of 1838 "are extended so as
to authorize the employment of ten additional chaplains for
military posts of the United States." 9 Stat. 351.
By § 1 of the act of February 21, 1857, c. 55, entitled "An
act to increase the pay of oficers of the Army," the pay of
commissioned officers of the Army is increased; and by
§ 2, it is provided "that the Secretary of War be authorized,
on the recommendation of the council of administration, to
extend the additional pay herein provided to any person
serving as chaplain at any post of the Army." 11 Stat. 163.
By the act of July 1?, 1862, c. 200, § 9, "the compensation
of all chaplains in the regular or volunteer service or army
hospitals shall be one hundred dollars per month and two
rations a day when on duty;" "chaplains employed at the
military posts called 'c haplains' posts' shall be required to
reside at the posts; and all chaplains in the United States
service shall be subject to such rules in relation to leave of
absencefromr duty as are prescribed for commissiofied officers
of the United States Army stationed at such posts." 12 Stat.
595.
By the act of April 9, 1864, c. 53, § 1, "the rank of chaplain

Opinion of the Court.

without command in the regular and 'volunteer service of the
United States is hereby recognized;" by § 2, the pension act
of July 14, 1862, c. 166, is "so amended as to include chaplains
in the regular and volunteer forces of the Army ;" and by § 3,
"it shall be the duty of chaplains in the military service of
the United States to make monthly reports to the adjutantgeneral of the Army, through the usual military channels, of
the moral condition and general history of the regiments,
hospitals or posts to which they may be attached." 13 Stat. 46.
These acts, all of which were passed before the period in
question, unequivocally show that such chaplains as the claimant was during that period -being
employed, by the officers
composing the council of administration at the post, to officiate
as chaplain, and actually serving as such, at a military post of
the United States, with the approval of the Secretary of War;
receiving monthly for their services a sum approved by him,
and allowed, in addition to their pay, rations and quarters; !
subject to the same rules as to leave of absence from duty as
commissioned officers of the Army; required to report monthly
to the adjutant-general of the Army through the usual military
channels; and called indifferently "chaplains attached to the
regular army and stationed at military posts," or "chaplains
of the Army of the United States" -should be considered,
according to the understanding and intention of Congress, as
holding the office and rank of chaplain in the Army, and
consequently as in the military service, within the meaning of
the longevity pay act.
Moreover, the act of March 2, 186[, c. 145, § 7,(under which
the claimant was afterwards commissioned,) by providing that
"the post chaplains now in service," as well as those thereafter
to be appointed, should be commissioned by the President,
distinctly recognized that the former were already in "service,"
which, in this act, as in the longevity pay act, clearly means
the military service of the United States. 14 Stat. 423.
