intent of Congress, and with the rule of construction judicially
established in similar cases, than to leave the question, whether
"toys" or "earthenware" was the fitter name for these articles, to be decided by the opinion of jurors, based upon their
personal knowledge or experience. The jury having been
distinctly instructed that if they found that there was no trade
designation of these articles as toys, and that they were not
chiefly used as playthings for children, the verdict should be
for the defendant, the defendant has no just ground of exception to the instructions given, or to the refusal to instruct as
requested.
The only other exception argued is to the exclusion of the
testimony of two witnesses as to what each of them was told,
upon inquiring for such articles, at a large toy-shop in Philadelphia just before the trial. This testimony was rightly
excluded. Upon the question of the ordinary meaning of the
word "toys," it was irrelevant. If such testimony could have
been competent under any circumstances to prove a commercial meaning, (which we do not intimate,) it certainly had
no tendency to prove what that meaning was at the time of
the passage of the act of 1883.

SOUTHWORTH v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROMX THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 171.

Argued December 15, 18,1893. -Decided

January 8,1894.

8283 complaints being made to a commissioner of a Circuit Court charging
that number of persons with violating the provisions of Rev. Stat. ยง 5512,
by fraudulently obtaining registration in Louisiana, that number of warrants were issued and delivered to the marshal. 6903 of the persons
against whom the warrants issued were not found. 1380 were arrested,
77 of whom were held for trial, and the remaining 1303 on examination
were discharged. The commissioner presented his account to the court,
claiming in each of the 8283 cases the fee of .$10,allowed by Rev. Stat.
ยง 1986 for "his services in each case, inclusive of all services incident to
the arrest and examination." The Circuit Court approved and allowed
the claim only as to the 77 cases, and that was paid. The commissioner

brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover a fee of $10, in each of
the other 8206 cases. The government demurred to the petition, and it
was dismissed. The claimant appealed from this judgment. Held,
(1) That the refusal of the Circuit Court to approve the account of the
commissioner, though no bar to the recovery, might be a matter
for consideration in respect to the good faith of the transaction;
(2) That the payment of the claim for the 77 cases conceded the sufficiency of the complaint on which, in each case, the proceeding
was founded;
(3) That when a defendant was arrested and an examination held, there
was a criminal case entitling the commissioner to a fee, although
the examination resulted in a discharge;
(4) That when no arrest was made, and no examination took place, no
case had arisen within the meaning of Rev. Stat. ยง 1986, entitling
the commissioner to a fee.

Tn's id an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims.
The action was commenced by John P. Southworth on December 16, 1882, to recover the sum of $82,830, for services as a
Circuit Court commissioner for the District of Louisiana.
The petition alleged that during the year 1876, 8283 complaints were made to him as such commissioner, charging certain persons named therein with the violation of section 5512,
Revised Statutes; that on such complaints the petitioner, as
commissioner, duly issued warrants against the persons named,
and delivered them to the marshal of the district; that of the
persons named in these complaints and warrants 6903 were
not found, and 1380 were arrested ;'that of those arrested 77
were held for trial, while the remiaining 1303 were, on examination, discharged.
The complaints are stated to have all been in this form:

The petition further alleged that the petitioner, as commissioner, made a docket entry of all the proceedings in each
case, as required by law, including therein the title of the case
with the name of the defendant, the drawing of the affidavit
or complaint and the date of the same, the issuing of the
warrant and itd date, the return of the officer, the arrest and
examination of the person charged in each case where an
arrest was made, the number of oaths administered and affidavits filed, and that he also kept full and correct files in
each case of all the papers therein, including affidavits, warrants, etc. ; that he presented his account, duly verified by his
oath, to the district attorney of said District of Louisiana,
who submitted the same in open court to the District Court,
and the court passed upon the same by approving the account
as to the seventy-seven cases in which the persons arrested
were held for trial, the amount of which was, as afterwards
admitted, paid by the government, and disallowing and refusing to certify the same as to the other cases. It further
alleged a presentation of his claim to the proper accounting

officers of the United States for settlement, and their refusal
to allow the same.
A demurrer to this petition having been sustained, 19 C. Cl.
278, the plaintiff amended, by adding allegations to the effect
that act iNo. 50 of the session laws of the general assembly of
iLouisiana, for the year 1874, required a registration of voters
for the election in 1876, and showing in a general way the facts
and circumstances which justified the commissioner, as claimed,
in finding that there was probable cause to believe that offences had been committed, and in issuing the warrants.
A demurrer to this amended petition was thereafter filed
and sustained, and judgment rendered dismissing the petition.
Pending the proceedings in the Court of Claims the petitioner died, and the suit was revived in the name of the
present plaintiff, his executrix.
Section 5512, Revised Statutes, is in chapter seven of the
title "Crimes."
By section 1982 the commissioners, with
other officers, are "a u thorized and required, at the expense of
the United States, to institute prosecutions against all persons
violating any of the provisions of chapter seven of the title
' Crimes,'" and by section 1986 the commissioner is "entitled
to a fee of ten dollars for his services in each case, inclusive of
all services incident to the arrest and examination."

MR. JUsTICE BREWE.E, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The magnitude of this claim is startling. If the fact be, as
stated in the report of the Comptroller, attached as an exhibit
to the petition, that these complaints were filed and warrants
issued during the twelve days from October 26 to November
6, or at the rate of about seven hundred a day, as only one
out of six of the persons named was ever found and arrested,

SOUTHWORTH v. UINITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

it is calculated to arouse a suspicion that these proceedings
were not had in the due and orderly administration of crimi-

nal law, and with a view to the arrest and punishment of
offenders, but rather for the sake of rolling up a pecuniary
claim against the government, or from some other equally dishonest motive. But it does not follow that the demurrer was
properly sustained or that the claim can rightfully be denied
by reason of the mere suspicion of wrong. If there had been
but a single case before the commissioner, and the proceedings
in that, as stated, be sufficient to establish a valid claim
against the United States, then the demurrer ought to have
been overruled, for the mere multiplication of the cases, even
into the thousands, does not, as a matter of law, disclose any
illegality. The facts attending the prosecutions should be
fully presented in order that the bonaftdes of the transaction
may be determined. We pass, therefore, to consider the
petition as though it alleged but one case before the commissioner, one complaint filed, one warrant issued, and one party
arrested.
That the refusal of the court to approve the account is no
bar to the action is settled by United States v. Knox, 128
U. S. 230, although such refusal may be a matter for consideration in respect at least to the good faith of the transaction.
United States v. Jones, 134 U. S. 483.
It is insisted by the government that the complaint does not
state an offence; that in consequence there was no foundation
for the issue of the warrant, or for the subsequent proceedings,
and hence that there was in law no case before the petitioner
as commissioner. We quote from the brief this statement of
the alleged defects:
"It is not alleged that the accused did register; nor that he
had no lawful right to register; nor that the registration books
upon which his name appeared were made for an election at
which a Representative in Gongress might be chosen; nor,
indeed, for any election whatever.
"It is, of course, perfectly clear that the affiants do not
pretend to swear, as to facts, that accused fraudulently
obtained registration contrary to law, but merely to express

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

a conclusion from the fact of non-residence at a certain
place."
โข It may be conceded that the*offence is not stated with the
fulness and technical accuracy required in an indictment, but
we do not think that the complaint can be treated as an absolute nullity. In the seventy-seven cases in which the parties
were arrested and held for trial it would seem that its sufficiency was conceded, for the account therefor was allowed
and paid. While no estoppel is created by the act of the
government in making such payment, yet it is significant as
showing that no technical accuracy in a complaint is considered
essential. Doubtless the defect in a complaint may be so great
as to suggest a lack of good faith on the part of the commissioner, but it would be placing an undue burden on such
officers to hold that their right to compensation rested on the
fact that the offence was stated with such precision as to be
beyond the reach of challenge. It is sufficient if the complaint
is full enough to clearly inform the defendant of the offence
with which he is charged. It was well said by the Supreme
Court of Alabama, in Crosy v. -Hawviorn,25 Alabama, 221,
223:
"In preliminary proceedings of this nature, which are
usually had before justices of the peace, technical accuracy
cannot be expected, and is not required. It is sufficient, if,
giving to the language employed its ordinary signification,
the court may gather from it that an offence against the
criminal law has been committed or attempted. If such proceedings were to be subjected to the rigid rules of criticism,
and all the constituent elements of the offence sought to be
investigated were required to be set forth in the affidavit or
warrant with certainty, the administration of the criminal law
would be greatly embarrassed, and offenders would often go
unpunished, by reason of the hazard which the justice who
issues, the party who procures, and the officer who executes
the warrant for arresting them would incur. We must be
content to gather the meaning of the party from the affidavit,
and disregard the want of technical accuracy of description."
There can be no mistake as to what was intended to be

SOUTHWORTH v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

charged in this complaint. It in effect alleges that the defendant was registered upon the registration books of a named
ward, and registered as claiming to reside at a given number
on a particular street in that ward; that he did not reside in
such place, or in the ward or parish of Orleans, and that,
therefore, he was fraudulently registered in violation of a
specified section of the statutes. Fraudulent registration is
the crime charged, and charged with particularity of section,
ward, residence claimed, and section of the statute violated.
Whether a party arrested upon a warrant issued on such
complaint could be discharged on habeas corpus, it is unnecessary to determine. Ex -parte "W'atins,3 Pet. 193, 203. For
it cannot be that a commissioner guarantees to the government
the sufficiency of the complaint filed before him, and is entitled
to no compensation if it be found defective. If he has proceeded in good faith to render services to the government,
acting upon a complaint manifestly intended to charge an
offence, and, the defendant having been arrested upon such
complaint holding an examination, and rendering a judicial
decision thereupon -in the language of the statute, "hearing
and deciding on criminal charges," he is entitled to compensation. We conclude, therefore, that this affidavit is not so
defective as to deprive the Commissioner of a right to compensation for services rendered in good faith in the proceedings
founded thereon.
It, of course, cannot be tolerated, in the absence of express
language, that compensation is to be paid when the defendant
is bound over for trial, and not when he is discharged. That
when the defendant is arrested and examination held there is
a "criminal case," is clear. Counselman v. H'itahcocek, 142
U. S. 54'T; United States v. Patterson, 150 U. S. 65. That,
unless there be an arrest and examination, there is no "case"
within the meaning of section 1986 is equally clear. The
amount allowed, ten dollars, precludes the idea that the mere
filing of a complaint and issue of a warrant is sufficient. And
the language of the statute is plain. The allowance is "for
his services in each case, inclusive of all services incident to
the arrest and examination."

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Syllabus.

It follows from these considerations that a cause of action
was stated as to the 1303 cases in which there was an arrest,
examination, and discharge of the defendant, and that the
Court of Claims erred in sustaining the demurrer to this
petition. Judgment will, therefore, be
Reversed, and the case remanded, with instructions to overrule the demurrer, and for further proceedings in con*fornit/to law.

MILLER v. EAGLE MAINUFACTURING
APPEAL FROM

THE CIRCUIT COURT

COMPANY.

OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.
No. 143. Argued December 11, 12,1893. -Decided

January 8,1894.

No patent can issue for an invention actually covered by a former patent,
especially to the same patentee, although the terms of the claims may
differ.
The second patent, in such case, although containing a claim broader and
more generical in its character than the specific claims contained in the
prior patent, is also void.
But where the second patent covers matter described in the prior patent,
essentially distinct and separable, and distinct from the invention covered
thereby, and claims made thereunder, its validity may be sustained.
A single invention may include both the machine and the manufacture it
creates, and in such case, if the inventions are separable, the inventor
may be entitled to a monopoly of each.
A second patent may be granted to an inventor for an improvement on the
invention protected by the first, but this can be done only when the new
invention is distinct from, and independent of, the former one.
It is only when an invention is broad and primary in its character, and the
mechanical functions performed by the machine are, as a whole, entirely
new, that courts are disposed to make the range of equivalents correspondingly broad.
The invention claimed and protected by the letters patent issued June 7, 1881,
to Edgar A. Wright, for new and useful improvements in wheeled cultivators, was anticipated by the claim in letters patent No. 222,767, granted
to him December 16, 1879, for improvements in wheeled cultivators.
The first claim in the said letters patent of June 7, 1881, was anticipated by
letters patent No. 190,816, issued May 15, 1877, to W. P. Brown for an
improved coupling for cultivators.
