OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

principle which the same court had previously laid down in
Commissioners of Sinking Fund v. Green & Barren River
lTavigation Co., '79 Kentucky, '73, and Commonwealth v.
Owensboro &c. Railroad, 95 Kentucky, 60, that a distinct
contract contained in a charter was not subject to the act
of 1856. Indeed, I do not understand upon what other theory
a positive acceptance of the taxation imposed by the Hewitt
Act was required of these banks.

delivered the opinion of the court.

The relief sought by the plaintiff in error was the nullity of
certain taxes levied by the city of Owensboro for the years
1893 and 18941. The grounds upon which this relief was
prayed are in all material respects like unto those relied on in
the two cases against the city of Owensboro, just decided.
The charter and an amendment extending the same were
both enacted after the act of 1856.
Indeed, this case along with the other two were disposed of
by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in the same opinion, because of the identity of the questions presented.
