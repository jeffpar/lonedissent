Statement of the Case.

MlcINTIRE v. PRYOR.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 109.

Argued January 4, 5, 1899. -Decided

February 20, IS99.

The facts in this case, as detailed in the statement of the case and the opinion of the court, show that a gross fraud was committed by the plaintiffs
in error against the defendants, to dispossess them of the property in
question; and in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, the
fraud, so glaring, the original and persistent intention of McIntire
through so many years to make himself the owner of the property, the
utter disregard shown of the rights of the plaintiff as well as of the
mortgagee, the false personation of Emma Taylor, and the fact that
the decree can do no harm to any innocent person, this court holds that
these facts do away with the defence of laches, and demand of the court
an affirmance of the action of the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia, granting the relief prayed for by the plaintiffs below.

THIS was a bill in equity filed in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia by Mary C. Pryor against Edwin A.
McIntire, Martha McIntire and Hartwell Jenison to obtain
the nullification and avoidance, upon the ground of fraud, of
a certain foreclosure of real estate in the city of Washington.
The facts were in substance that, in May, 1880, the plaintiff Mary C. Pryor, being the owner of parts of lots twentyone and twenty-two in square numbered 569, conveyed the
same by trust deed to Edwin A. McIntire to secure the
defendant Hartwell Jenison in the sum of $450 for money
advanced by Tenison, which was represented by a note made
by the complainant and her husband Thomas Pryor, since
deceased, payable one year after date, with interest at the
rate of eight per cent, payable quarterly.
Default having been made in payment of the note, the
property was regularly advertised for sale under the deed of
trust, and, after a week's postponement on account of the
weather, was sold on June 17, 1881, and bought in nominally
by Jenison for $806, the difference between $450, the amount
of the Jenison loan, and $806, the amount for which the prop-

erty was sold, being the taxes which had accrued on the property, together with the expenses and commissions attending
the sale, which amounted all told to $839.19. In this connection the plaintiff averred that the defendant McIntire
had represented to her husband, Thomas Pryor, that the sale
would be only a matter of form, and that he, Pryor, could
buy in the property, and that time would be given him to
pay the indebtedness; that the sale was made without the
knowledge of Jenison, the holder of the note secured by the
deed of trust; that, as had been previously agreed, Pryor,
the husband of the plaintiff, did in fact become the purchaser
at the trustees' sale for the sum of $700, and the property
was struck off to him; that they were not disturbed in the
possession of the property for some time, when McIntire
called on them and told them that they might pay rent to
him, and that it would be applied to the payment of the principal of the debt, and that accordingly they paid rent until
September, 1884, at the rate of six dollars per month, with
the understanding that this would be applied to the liquidation of the note, and that when the same was paid the property would be reconveyed to the plaintiff. On June 29, 1881,
a few days after the sale, a deed was executed to Jenison, for
the nominal consideration of $806, and on the same day Jenison gave a new note to one Emma Taylor for the sum of $425,
and secured the same by a deed of trust on the same property,
the note being payable one year after date with eight per cent
interest. Subsequently, and on April 21, 1882, Jenison conveyed the property outright to Emma Taylor on receiving
the $425 note.
Subsequently, and in May, 1884, Emma Taylor conveyed
the property to Martha McIntire, the sister of the defendant
Edwin A. McIntire. By reason of some supposed defect in
the deed from Jenison to Taylor, Jenison subsequently, and
on September 27, 1887, made a quitclaim deed of his interest
in the property to Martha McIntire, who, in October, 1886,
built four houses upon the property, two fronting on F street
and two in the rear facing an alley, of which she has had the
use and enjoyment ever since.

OCTOBER TERIM, 1898.
Statement of the Case.

Plaintiff's averments in this connection were that the sale
by McIntire under the Jenison deed of trust was made in his
own interest, with the fraudulent intent of getting possession
of the property; that the $425 note given by Jenison to
Emma Taylor, secured by a deed of trust, was fictitious and a
part of the same scheme; that Emma Taylor was a fictitious
person; that the deeds to her were void; that the deed from
her to Martha McIntire was also fictitious, and that the subsequent deed from Jenison to Martha McIntire of September 27,
1887, was procured by the fraudulent representations of Edwin
A. McIntire.
The prayer was that the sale under the deed of trust be set
aside; that an account be taken of what was due by the plaintiff upon the note for $150, and upon the payment of the same
that the plaintiff be declared the owner of the property, and
that the trustees be required to account to her for rents, issues
and profits received by them on account of such property
since the foreclosure sale.
The answer of Edwin A. McIntire denied all allegations of
fraud and deceit; averred that the sale was bona fide in all
respects; that he had no interest whatever in the property,
and that it belonged to his sister Martha McIntire, who bought
it in the regular course of business, and who, in her answer,
denied that she participated in or had anything to do with any
fraudulent scheme to get possession of the property, or that
she had knowledge of any fraud on the part of her brother,
and alleged that she was a true and bona fide purchaser of
the property in dispute.
Jenison also answered the bill, stating that he had directed
the sale to be made and the property bought in for him, if
necessary for his protection; that he made the deed to Emma
Taylor, as well as the quitclaim deed to Martha McIntire, and
that he knew nothing whatever of any fraud on the part of
Edwin A. McIntire.
Upon a hearing upon pleadings and proofs, the Supreme
Court rendered a decree dismissing the bill upon the ground
of laches. Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, which
reversed the decree of the court below; remanded the case to

McINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Statement of the Case.

the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, with instructions to take an account of the indebtedness due by the plaintiff to Jenison, together with an account of the rents and
profits collected by the defendants, and directed that upon
the coming in of such report a final decree be passed annulling
each and all of the several trust deeds that clouded the title
to said premises, and awarding possession thereof to plaintiff
upon her paying the amount due Jenison, and to the defendant Martha McIntire, upon the statement of the account. 7
D. C. App. 417.
In compliance with these instructions the Supreme Court
subsequently entered a final decree in favor of the plaintiff,
for $1664.93, and set aside the deed of trust from plaintiff
and her husband to Edwin A. McIntire, and all the subsequent
deeds, six in number, which operated as a cloud upon plaintiff's title.
Another appeal was taken from this decree to the Court of
Appeals, which affirmed the decree of the Supreme Court, 10
D. C. App. 432, whereupon Edwin A. Mclntire and Martha
McIntire took an appeal to this court.
Shortly after the commencement of this suit, four other
suits were begun by Elizabeth Brown, Annie Ackerman, John
Southey et al. and Joseph Hayne and wife, for similar purposes as the above, to procure the annulment of certain deeds
of real estate to and from Emma Taylor, based upon her supposed fictitious character. The details of the fraud set forth
in these bills were different, but in all of them the fictitious
character of Emma Taylor was charged, and in all of them,
but one, Martha McIntire purported to have become the
owner of the property. For the purpose of saving the expense
of repeating testimony, it was stipulated that the testimony
in each of the cases, so far as relevant, might be read and considered by the court as having been taken in each of the other
cases. The Court of Appeals entered a decree in each of
these cases, except one which was dismissed on the ground of
laches, granting the relief prayed. The amount involved in
the other cases, except the Pryor case, was insufficient to give
this court jurisdiction; but upon the appeal to this court the

BROWN,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Two questions are presented by the record in this case:
First, that of fraud in the sale and subsequent manipulation
of the property in suit; and, second, that of laches in instituting these proceedings.
1. The question of fraud necessarily involves the examination of a large amount of testimony, and a scrutiny of the
successive steps taken, which finally re.sulted in the transfer
of the property from its original owner, Mary Pryor, to its
present owner of record, Martha McIntire.
The bill avers and the answer admits the execution of a
deed of trust May 2, 18S0, by the plaintiff and her husband
to Edwin A. McIntire as trustee, to secure a note for $450,
payable to Hlartwell Jenison one year after date, with interest
at eight per cent. The transaction originated four years previously, (May 2, 1876,) when the plaintiff and her husband
placed upon the same property a deed of tvust, in which Brainard I. Warner and Henry McIntire were named as trustees,
to secure a note of $500, payable to George E. Emmons two
years after date, with interest at ten per cent. This loan
had been made through the agency of B. IH. Warner & Co.,
real estate agents, and the note appears to have been purchased as an investment by Jenison, who was then a clerk
in the Treasury Department. Upon the maturity of this
note, May 2, 1878, twenty-five dollars were paid by way of
interest, and fifty dollars on account of the principal, but
nothing was done until 1880, when the deed of trust for 8450
was given. Jenison appears to have purchased the first note

McINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

at the suggestion of Henry McIntire, a brother of Edwin
A., who was also a clerk in the Treasury Department. Jenison states that Edwin A. collected what was paid upon the
note and attended to the second deed of trust himself, in
which his name was substituted as trustee in the place of the.
trustees named in the first deed. Jenison appears never to
have seen the Pryors, nor their property, having entire confidence in McIntire's integrity. The property seems to havw
been worth at that time from $1800 to $2400, and was occupied by the plaintiff's husband as a wood and coal yard. Both
the Pryors were uneducated colored people, Pryor making
his living by whitewashing, sawing wood, and selling coal,
and his wife by taking in washing. The husband died about
three months before this suit was begun.
The note fell due May 2, 1881. Neither principal nor interest was paid, and upon the following day, May 3, a warranty
deed appears to have been executed by plaintiff and her husband to Martha MoIntire, a sister of the principal defendant,
for tle nominal consideration of five dollars. It does not
clearly appear why this deed was executed, as it was never
recorded. Upon its face it is an ordinary warranty deed, and
although the Christian name of the grantee, Martha, is obviously written over an erasure, attention is called to this
fact in the testamentary clause. The grantors' signatures
are probably genuine, although the deed appears to have
been procured of the plaintiff in total igrorance of its contents or purport. Indeed, she had never seen Martha McIntire and knew absolutely nothing about her. Edwin A.
McIntire's explanation is that Pryor came to him; said that
he could not pay the note, and asked him whether he could
get a purchaser of the property who would take it off his
hands and assume the incumbrance and taxes, which he
represented to be twenty or thirty dollars; that he offered
it to his sister as an investment; had the deed made to her
for a nominal consideration, with the understanding that she
would assume the incumbrance and give Pryor a lease on the
property for a year. He afterwards ascertained that the taxes
were ten times the amount he had supposed, and reported the

OCTOBER TERIM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

fact to his sister, who thereupon declined to take the property,
which accordingly went to a foreclosure. In explanation of
the erasure lie said the deed was first made to his uncle David
iMcIntire. who was looking out for bargains in real estate, and
then altered to Martha McIntire and noted on the deed itself.
It seems somewhat singular that neither of these parties
should have been willing to give five dollars for a piece of
property worth at least $1800, and subject only to the lien of
a mortgage of about $475, and $250 of special taxes; and
equally singular that the Pryors should have been willing to
dispose of their equity in the property for so small a sum.
Indeed, it is difficult to believe that they knew what they
were doing when they signed the deed.
But as nothing has ever been claimed by virtue of this deed,
it is practically out of the case, except so far as it tends
strongly to show an original design on the part of Edwin A.
McIntire, who had entire charge of the transaction and witnessed the deed, to vest the title to the property in.some
member of his family, whom the other evidence in the case
shows him to have used as a mere catspaw for himself..
Failing to induce his sister to take the property, McIntire,
as trustee, obtained written authority from Jenison to sell
upon foreclosure of the deed of trust, advertised the property
for sale upon June 10, and after a postponement sold the same
on June 17, but to whom the property was struck off, and
who was the real purchaser, is somewhat uncertain. There is
a wide divergence in the testimony on this point. Plaintiff
swears that the first intimation she had of the sale was the
display of the auctioneer's flag in front of the property, which
was then occupied as a coal yard. Not understanding what
it meant, her husband went to see Mentire, who came down
that day, and "said that the trustee was pushing him, and he
was compelled to put the flag up and have a sale, but that he
would allow my husband to bid it in and would knock it down
to him." Three or four witnesses, who were present at the
sale, swore that the property was struck off to Pryor. Plaintiff swore to the same effect, but she was so far from where
the auctioneer stood that it was very doubtful whether she

McINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

could have heard it. She also swore to an agreement that she
was to pay a rent of six dollars a month for the property,
which was to be applied .on the purchase money. Certain it
is that rent was paid for the property after the sale and until
some time in 1883, sixteen receipts for which, signed by
McIntire, are produced. This testimony with regard to the
sale and the arrangement for payment is wholly denied by
McIntire, who produces a bill for auctioneer's services, showing the sale of the property to Jenison, to whom on June 29,
18S1, McIntire executed a deed of the property in alleged
pursuance of the foreclosure sale, upon an expressed consideration of $806, but kept the same from record unknown to Jenison for a period of nearly ten months, and until April 21,
1882, when he caused the same to be recorded. Did the case
stand upon this testimony alone we should entertain grave
doubts whether the oral evidence was sufficiently definite and
credible to overcome the testimony of Mclntire, the documentary evidence of the receipts for rent and the deed to
Jenison in pursuance of the sale; but all doubts in this particular are fully resolved by the subsequent conduct of McIntire with reference to the property.
It seems that Jenison, being unable or unwilling to pay the
expenses of foreclosure, which amounted to $87.88 and accumulated taxes to the amount of $278.81, for the purpose of
raising money to pay these, executed a note to one Emma
Taylor for $425, payable in one year, and secured the same
by a deed of trust upon the property to the defendant
MclIntire as sole trustee. This deed was also executed on
June 29, 1881, and was of even date with the deed executed
by M cIntire to Jenison in pursuance of the foreclosure.
The testimony in this case turns largely upon the existence
and identity of Emma Taylor. It is charged in the bill that
she is a fictitious person, and that a sistbr of Mclutire's, whose
name was Emma T. McIntire, was represented and held out
by him as Emma Taylor. Certainly, so far as witnesses have
sworn to having seen Emma Taylor, they might easily have
been led into supposing that his sister was this person. All
that we know definitely of Emma Taylor is that from April 1,

OCTOBER TERAM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

1881, to September 6, 1884, her name appears as grantor or
grantee in seventeen different deeds, having an aggregate
consideration of some $13,000. Copies of nine of these deeds
appear in the record, in all but one of which she is described
as of the city of Philadelphia, although all of these deeds,
both to and from herself, were executed in Washington and
acknowledged before the same magistrate. No letters written
by her are produced, and but one addressed to her. This
bears date September 19, 1887, and was written by McIntire,
asking for her address. The letter seems to have been addressed simply to "1Pittsburg, Penn.," on some information of
her being there, and to have been returned to the writer.
This letter was probably a subterfuge. The transactions in
which she appears as a party all seem to have been carried
on through McIhtire as agent, who collected rents and other
moneys, paid taxes and made repairs on her account. She
seems then to have disappeared as suddenly as she originally
appeared, and McIntire professes himself entirely unable to
find her, or learn of her present whereabouts. This is certainly a feeble and suspicious explanation. In view of the
number and magnitude of the transfers to which she was a
party, we should have reason to expect that her existence
could be established beyond the shadow of a doubt. If she
were a resident of Philadelphia, as now claimed, jcIntire
could hardly have failed to have had correspondence with
her; to have known her address and to have been able to find
dozens of her friends, relatives or neighbors, who could have
proved that she was a living person. If she were a resident
of Washington during these years, where did she live? In
what bank did she keep the money she invested in real estate?
Who were her acquaintances and why did she vanish so suddenly after these large transactions? She could scarcely have
failed to leave a correspondent here, and that correspondent
could scarcely have failed to be fcIntire himself. It is incredible that a woman so well off and so alert in matters of
business should have disappeared at the moment when her
presence was indispensable and left no trace behind her.
What have we in lieu of what we might naturally have ex-

McINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

pected? A few witnesses who swear they saw her once and
saw her under circumstances which indicated that they had
seen a woman who passed under that name, and who might
have been a wholly different person-one, who took a deed
from her, and after testifying that he had never seen her, on
being recalled said that he "somehow had the impression"
that upon one occasion she had been pointed out by McIntire's
clerk in his office as Emma Taylor. The clerk himself, who
was in McIntire's employ five years, has no recollection of
ever meeting her, but had heard her name mentioied, and
thinks he must have seen her from the faut that he witnessed
a deed purporting to have been signed by her. Another,
who kept an ice cream parlor on G street from 1876 to 1879,
saw her once or twice in McIntire's office, and heard her
called Emma Taylor by a lady who used to -come to his parlor with her. Another, who used to visit McIntire's office
every day in 1879, saw a lady frequently come there, whom
he was informed was Emma Taylor, and that she talked about
buying real estate. It appears, however, that there was no
deed to her prior to April 1, 1881. Another, who had her
studio on F street, used to take -her meals at the same dining
room, heard her spoken of as M[iss Taylor, but never spoke
to her herself, and did not know whether her name was
Emma Taylor or not. Another, named Atkinson, who was
with McIntire until the latter part of 1880, testified that he
saw a woman a number of times in the office whose name
he understood was Emma Taylor, and that she was a different person from Emma T. McIntire. Another testified that
he had met her at the office of the magistrate before whom
she made her acknowledgments.
In addition to this most indefinite testimony, we have only
the testimony of Edwin A. McIntire, Martha McIntire and
Emma T. McIntire, two of whom are parties to this suit and
strongly interested in the result. Emma T. McIntire testifies
that she was never called Emma Taylor, and that her middle
name was not Taylor, and that she never executed any of
the deeds purporting to have been signed by Emma Taylor.
Neither she nor her sister seems to have met her more than

OCTOBER TERN, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

three or four times. It further appears that all the deeds
to Emma Taylor, even from McIntire himself, carried to the
recorder's office for record, were returned to McIntire, though
this was denied by him, and that rents due to Emma Taylor
were all paid to him. It seems, too, that he paid all the taxes
upon her property, though he swears he has no recollection
of doing so.
We give but little weight to the certificate of the magistrate who was not sworn as a witness, that Emma Taylor
appeared before him and acknowledged the deeds to which
her name was appended as grantor, since it would have been
practically easy for McIntire to represent another person as
Emma Taylor.
The testimony of McIntire himself with regard to Emma
Taylor is extremely unsatisfactory. Notwithstanding the number and magnitude of the transactions in which he took part
and acted as her agent, he has no explanation of the manner
in which the consideration for these deeds was paid or received by her, the bank in which it was deposited, or from
which it was drawn, and is unable to produce a single check
or letter signed with her name. His memory is excellent
where he cannot be contradicted and as to unimportant details, but fails him utterly as to the leading facts of the transactions. While for three years his relations with her must
have been constant and confidential, collecting and disbursing
moneys for her and looking out for real estate investments,
yet he produces no account with her, and professes to have
completely forgotten that he ever collected rent for her at
all. One Alfred Brown" who bought property from her in
May, 1883, gave $200 in cash and twelve notes of $75 each,
payable at intervals of three months, the last maturing in
May, 1886, swears that he paid every one of them as they
fell due to McIntire personally; yet McIntire swears he has
no recollection of collecting these notes, and that Emma disappeared from Washington about 1884. He tells us that she
was a woman who was constantly looking out for bargains
in real estate, yet the records show that all her transactions
were with him or through his agency, and in every case in

McLNTIIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

which she became the purchaser of lands the title ultimately
became vested in his sister Martha. In this connection it is
a suspicious circumstance that whenever she made a conveyance, the deed was not usually recorded for years afterwards,
when the necessity for making a complete chain of title required it to be put on file. Upon the other hand, the deeds
made to her as grantee were immediately placed on record.
None of the parties to whom she gave or from whom she
received deeds of property ever met her, nor did the clerk in
Mclntire's office during these years recollect that he had ever
seen her.
iHe accounts for his inability to produce letters, receipts,
accounts or written evidences of any sort, showing his transactions with her, by an utterly improbable story of a fire in
his office, which seems to have conveniently consumed all
these documents, including a large ledger, in which her accounts were contained, and to have spared everything else,
leaving no mark of fire or even the stain of smoke upon documents showing his relation to others. He professes to have
thought that Emma Taylor was engaged in one of the departments, because she came down F street after the hour the
departments would close, but never asked her in what department she was employed, and the compiler of the "Blue Book"
swears that no such person was in the employ of the Government in Washington at that time. All the witnesses who
testified to having seen a person of that name fixed the time
as prior to the date of her first deed, April 1, 1881; and not
one of them, except the McIntires, is able to identify her as
the Emma Taylor who signed the deeds in question.
There is strong evidence tending to establish the identity
of Emma Taylor and Emma T. McIntire. A niece of McIntire's sweirs that she always understood that the initial in
the name of Emma T. McIntire stood for Taylor, and that she
was always called Emma Taylor to distinguish her from witness' sister Emma V. McIntire. This witness is corroborated
by the production of the family Bible, from which it appears
that Emma T. McIntire's father was named Edwin Taylor
'McIntire. Her own explanation, that her middle initial stood

Opinion of the Court.

for Tinsey Ush or Tots -a pet name given her in infancy by
her father -does not seem plausible in the face of this testimony. In addition to this, a large number of documents,
signed both by Emma Taylor and Emma T. McIntire, were
introduced in evidence for other purposes, and a comparison
of the signatures shows a resemblance between some of them
which is difficult to account for, except upon the theory that
they were written by the same person, although the later ones
signed by Emma Taylor show an evident attempt to disguise
her hand.
But it is useless to pursue this subject further. The testimony of the three McIntires is too full of contradictions and
absurdities to be given any weight. While under certain circumstances the other testimony for the defendant might be
sufficient to prove that there was such a person as Emma
Taylor, when considered with reference to what we have a
right to expect in a case of this kind, it falls far short of it,
and when read in connection with plaintiff's testimony upon
the same point, we are left in no doubt that Emma Taylor was
a clumsy fabrication. If the person put forward by McIntire
to personate her were not his own sister, it was some one
whom he used for that purpose. Under whatever view we
take we are satisfied that Emma Taylor was a creation of
iM-cIntire's brain, born of the supposed necessities of his case,
and bolstered up by the false testimony of himself and his
sisters. Stat nominis izmbra.
The subsequent proceedings in the case show a consummation of the fraud by which the property was ultimately vested
in Martha McIntire. The deed of trust given by Jenison to
Emma Taylor was never formally foreclosed. It seems that
McIntire had promised Jenison that he would try and find a
purchaser of the property before the note fell due on June 29,
1882, so that he might get back a part of the $450 loaned to
Pryor, none of which he had received ; but professed himself
unable to do so, and so informed Jenison, a man of perfect
integrity but of little experience and much unwisdom in business methods, who seems to have had entire confidence in
him, and on April 13, 1882, addressed him a note, in which he

Opinion of the Court.

stated that he was not in a condition to carry the property;

that he should doubtless have to submit to a sacrifice by a
forced sale, and requested him to advertise and do the best he
could in its disposition. Considering that the property was
worth from $1800 to $2400, when the mortgage to Emma
Taylor was only $425, the interest on which was less than $40
per year, while the Pryors were paying six dollars a month
rent, it would appear that Jenison was completely hoodwinked
as to its actual value.
After some futile efforts to induce McIntire to put the property up at auction, he was finally persuaded, on April 19, 1882,
more than two months before the Emma Taylor note was due,
to deed the property to Emma Taylor. This deed was recorded immediately and at the same time with his deed upon
foreclosure to Jenison, which had been executed ten months
before. Both of these deeds, after being recorded, were returned to McIntire. This was the last step necessary to consummate the fraud by which the plaintiff lost her property,
and Jenison lost the money he had loaned her upon the deed
of trust. Had McIntire been content to defraud the Pryors
of their property, he might, after his duties as trustee had
been fully discharged, have purchased of Jenison, who doubtless would have been glad to sell for the amount of his mortgage and interest; but his desire also to defraud Jenison of
this amount made it necessary for him to introduce another
party to purchase Jenison's interest, from whom his sister
Martha (that is, himself) might pose as a bona fde purchaser.
In this he overreached himself.
The title remained of record in Emma Taylor until May 31,
1884, when she made a warranty deed to the defendant Martha McIntire for the expressed consideration of $2500. Subsequently, and on September 27, 1887, Jenison and wife made
a quitclaim deed, apparently of further assurance, to Martha
McIntire, for a consideration of $100, paid by the check of
Edwin A. McIntire. The answer av ers this deed to have been
made to cover and cure a defect in the deed from Jenison to
Taylor, but on its face it purported to pass to the grantee,
Martha McIntire, all claims for drawback or rebate on account

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

of special taxes upon the property, and it is probable that this
was its main object.
We do not care to discuss the question whether Martha
McIntire was a bonaXfde purchaser of this property. So far as
it turns upon her ability to pay the $2500 named as a consideration, it is at least doubtful. So far as it turns upon her actual
payment of this consideration, it is more than doubtful. If
Emma Taylor were a fictitious person, and the deed from her
a forgery, the title of Martha McIntire falls to the ground, except so far as it depends upon the quitclaim deed of Jenison
to her of September 27, 1887, which it is not improbable was
procured by Edwin A. McIntire for the very purpose of giving a semblance of title in case Emma Taylor were eliminated
from the case. But whatever was done by Martha McIntire
to this property; whatever title she acquired was through the
agency of her brother, and she is as chargeable with his frauds
as if she had committed them personally. United States v.
State Banke, 96 U. S. 30; Gristoold v. 11aven, 25 N. Y. 595;
Reynolds v. IVitte, 13 S. 0. 5. It was held by this court in
the case of Tlie -DistilledSpirits, 11 Wall. 356, that the rule
that notice of fraud to an agent is notice to the principal applies not only to knowledge acquired by the agent in the particular transaction, but to knowledge acquired by him as agent
in a prior transaction for the same principal, and present to
his mind at the time he is acting as such agent. Much more
is this the case where the fraud is committed by the agent
himself in obtaining the title to the property for the benefit
of his principal. But further than this, we have little doubt
that the property was really purchased for the benefit of
McIntire himself. While Martha Mclntire signed the contract
for the construction of the house upon these lands, the testimony of the contractors shows that they supposed they were
doing the work for McIntire himself; that they had no dealings with Martha; that they were paid by checks signed by
McIntire himself; although she came down and looked at the
houses, and seemed to be pleased with them.
We agree with the Court of Appeals that in view of their
strong pecuniary interest in the case, the improbability of

Opinion of the Court.

many of their statements, the obvious fabrication of the Emma
Taylor story, and the manifest subservience of the sisters to
their brother's schemes, no confidence whatever can be placed
in the testimony of either member of the family. This conviction is strengthened by a circumstance appearing in the
testimony, although not directly relevant to the issue, that
there was another sister, Sarah I. McInt.ire, who died in Philadelphia, January 10, 1881, leaving a deposit of $1196.60 in
the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. To obtain this money
19, 1881, was prea power of attorney, bearing date Aril
pared by McIntire, purporting to be signed by Sarah I. McIntire,
though she had been dead three months, and acknowledged
before a notary public in Washington. It was also signed by
McIntire as a subscribing witness, and by virtue of its authority
Martha McIntire drew the money from the bank.
2. The question of laches only remains to he considered.
The sale was made under the foreclosure of the Jenison mortgage, June 17, 1881. The bill was filed October 21, 1890, a
delay of nine years and four months. Upon the theory of
the plaintiff, however,-and it is upon her allegations and
proofs that the question of laches must be determined,- the
sale was made in her interest. The rent paid by her was to
be applied by Mclntire toward the extinguishment of the
Jenison mortgage, and there was nothing definite to apprise
her to the contrary until the fall of 1886, when she saw the
contractors beginning to build, and notified them that the
property belonged to her and not to McIntire. But four years
elapsed from this time and the property has not been shown to
have greatly increased in value except by the improvements,
which were allowed to the defendants upon final decree.
We have a right to consider in this connection that the
plaintiff is an ignorant colored woman; that she has been
wheedled out of her property by an audacious fraud, committed by one in whom she placed entire confidence and who
assumed to act as her agent; that this agent procured the
title to the property to be taken in his own interest for little
more than a nominal sum by the false personation of Emma
Taylor; that the property is still controlled and probably

Opinion of the Court.

owned by himself; that the position of the property and of
the parties to the suit has not materially changed during the
time the plaintiff has been in default, nor the property shown
to have rapidly risen in value, and that the rights of no bona
fide purchaser have intervened.
We have no desire to qualify in any way the long line of
cases in this court, too numerous even for citation, in which
we have held that where the fraud is constructive, or is proved
by inconclusive testimony, or by evidence falling short of conviction, and the property has greatly increased in value, great
diligence will be required in the assertion of the plaintiff's
rights. But these were all cases either of bills to establish a
trust, to open settled accounts, bills not involving fraud, or
where the fraud was not clearly proven, or where, with knowledge of the facts, the fraud had been deliberately acquiesced
in, bills to impeach judicial proceedings, or where the property
had passed into the hands of persons innocent of the fraud,
or with no actual notice that a fraud had been committed.
Granting all that may jbe fairly claimed of these cases,
there is another class having a different bearing, in which it
has been held that in case of actual fraud a delay, even
greater than that permitted by the statute of limitations, is
not fatal to the plaintiff's claim. The leading case is that of
_3fichoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, which was a case of actual
fraud committed by trustees of real estate against their ceseti
que trust. A bill filed thirty-six years after the commission
of the fraud was held not to have been too late. In that
c.ase a purchase by an executor through a third person, of
property of the testator, was held to be fraudulent and void,
though the sale was at public auction, judicially ordered, and
the result of the evidence was that a fair price was paid.
Said Mr. Justice Wayne, in delivering the opinion of the
court, (page 560) : "In a case of actual fraud, courts of equity
give relief after a long lapse of time, much longer than has
passed since the executors, in this instance, purchased their
testator's estate. In general, length of time is no bar to a
trust clearly established to have once existed; and where
fraud is imputed and proved, length of time ought not to

XIINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

exclude relief. . . . There is no rule in equity which
excludes the consideration of circumstances, and, in a case of

actual fraud, we believe no case can be found in the books in
which a court of equity has refused to give relief within the
lifetime of either of the parties upon whom the fraud is
proved, or within thirty years after it has been discovered
or becomes known to the party whose rights are affected
by it."
So, in Prevost v. Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481, 497, it was said by
Mr. Justice Story: "It is certainly true that length of time
is no bar to a trust clearly established; and in a case where
fraud is imputed and proved, length of time ought not, upon
principles of eternal justice, to be admitted to repel relief.
On the contrary, it would seem that the length of time during
which the fraud has been successfully concealed and practised,
is rather an aggravation of the offence and calls more loudly
upon a court of equity to grant ample and decisive relief."
In Baker v. WAiting, 3 Sumn. 475, one Tidd, being the
owner of certain land, employed the defendant Whiting as
his agent to care for the same, pay all taxes, etc. Whiting
allowed the land to be sold for taxes in 1821 and bought it
in himself, keeping the plaintiff uninformed of the facts.
The bill was filed in 1837 by the heirs of Tidd, who died
shortly after his employment of Whiting. In delivering the
opinion, Mr. Justice Story remarked: "Then it is said the
plaintiffs are barred from any right in equity by the mere
lapse of time.

.

.

But what is more particularly appli-

cable to the present case, twenty years had not elapsed before
the filing of the bill; and I apprehend that, in case of a trust
of lands nothing short of the statute period, which would bar
a legal estate or a right of entry, would be permitted to operate in equity as a bar of the equitable estate."
In Allore v. Jewell, 94 U. S. 506, which was a bill to cancel
a conveyance of land alleged to have been obtained by the
grantor a few weeks before her death, when from her condition she was incapable of understanding the nature or effect
of the transaction, it was held that a lapse of six years before
bringing suit to cancel the conveyance could not avail the

defendant, where he had possession of the land and a reasonable rent therefor was equal to the value of his improvements,
and there had been no loss of evidence preventing a fall presentation of the case.
In Xeader v. Aforton, 11 Wall. 442, three sisters obtained
in 1839, from the governor of California, a tract of land which
was approved by the departmental assembly and possession
delivered. Some years after, the husband of one of the sisters, named B3olcoff, suppressed or destroyed this grant and
fabricated a pretended grant to himself, and also certain
other papers intended to prove the genuineness of such fabricated grant. Upon these papers the sons of Bolcoff, he having died, obtained a confirmation of their claim to the land,
the land commissioners supposing that the fabricated papers
were genuine; and upon such decree a patent issued to the
claimants. The fabricated character of these papers being
discovered, the grantee of the rights of the three sisters
brought a suit in equity to have the defendants holding under
the patent declared trustees of the legal title and compel a
transfer of that title to him. Held: that the suit, which was
begun in 1865, would lie, and that laches could not prevail as
a defence where the relief sought was granted on the ground
of secret fraud, and it appeared that the suit was commenced
a reasonable time after the fraud was discovered.
In Insurance Co. v. Eldredge, 102 U. S. 545, 548, a deed of
trust of lands to secure a promissory note was released without the surrender or payment of the note, and without express
authority of the holder. It was held that a subsequent purchaser with notice took the land subject to the equitable
rights of such holder. The extent of the delay does not
clearly appear in the report, but in the opinion of the court
it is said by Mr. Justice Field: "The company, as already
stated, must be deemed to have known of the want of power
in the trustee to release the property from the Coburn deed,
and it does not lie in its mouth to object that the complainant did not sooner seek to set aside the priority of lien thus
gained; nor can it aver that his claim to have the instrument
cancelled, by which this priority was secured, is a stale one,

Opinion of the Court.

when asserted within the period allowed by law, and no
rights of third parties as bonafide purchasers have intervened
to render inequitable the assertion of his original lien."
In Bowen v. Evans, 2 H. L. 257, a bill filed to set aside a
sale of lands made nearly fifty years before under a decree,
on the ground of irregularities in the proceedings and fraud in
the sale, it was held that, in the absence of proof of fraud
on the part of the purchaser, or that the estate was sold under
the value by reason of any corrupt bargain, the sale was not
impeachable; but in delivering the opinion Lord Chancellor
Cotteuham observed: "So, when much time has elapsed since
the transactions complained of, there having been parties who
were competent to have complained, the court will not, upon
doubtful or ambiguous evidence, assume a case of fraud,
although upon fraud clearly established no lapse of time will
protect the parties to it, or those who claim through them,
against the jurisdiction of equity depriving them of the fruits
of their plunder."
The case of Hopkins v. Hammond, 143 U. S. 224, a leading
case in this court, is not to the contrary. In this case two
partners owned real estate in common, some of which was
used in the partnership business. One died making the other
by his will a trustee for the testator's children, with power
of sale of all the real estate, and directing that the business be
conitinued. After carrying on the business for some time the
trustee sold the real estate by auction, and bought portions of
it in through a third person, and accounted for half of the net
proceeds. The transaction was open and known to all the cestuis que trustent, and was objected to by none of them. It
was held that there was nothing in this to indicate fraud;
that the purchase was not absolutely void but voidable, and
might be confirmed by the parties interested, either directly
or by long acquiescence, or by the absence of an election to
avoid the conveyance within a reasonable time after the facts
came to their knowledge. There was a delay of nearly twenty
years in this case. In delivering the opinion the Chief Justice
said: "Each case must necessarily be governed by its own
circumstances, since, though the lapse of a few years may be

OCTOBER TERM:, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

sufficient to defeat the action-in one case, a longer period may
be held requisite in another, dependent upon the situation of
the parties, the extent of their knowledge or means of information, great changes in values, the want of probable grounds
for the imputation of intentional fraud, the destruction of specific testimony, the absence of any reasonable impediment or
hindrance to the assertion of the alleged rights, and the like."
A bare statement of these facts will show that it has no application to the case now under consideration.
So in Felix v. Patrick,145 U. S.317, where a bill was filed
after a lapse of twenty-eight years to impeach a title fraudulently acquired through the location of certain land script, and
the land was shown to have increased enormously in value by
being taken within the limits of a city, and to have been
largely occupied by persons who had bought on the strength
of the apparent title, and erected buildings of a permanent
character, it was held that the complainant was barred by
laches, but in the opinion of the court it is said: "The law pronounces the transaction a fraud upon her, but it lacks the element of wickedness necessary to constitute moral turpitude.
If there had been a deliberate attempt on his part by knavish
practices to beguile or wheedle her out of these lands, we
should have been strongly inclined to afford the plaintiffs' relief at any time during the life of either of the parties; but as
the case stands at present justice requires only what the law,
in the absence of the statutory limitation, would demand the repayment of the value of the script with legal interest
thereon."
In Norris v. ilaggin,136 U. S.386, plaintiff filed his bill in
1884, alleging an actual fraud committed against him by his
two attorneys in 1859, twenty-five years previously, and that
he had only discovered the fraud a short time before commencing his suit. The case was heard on demurrer to the
bill, and the court found that "there are many things about
the bill which are peculiar and calculated to throw suspicion
on the claims." It also found that the statement that the complainant had only come to a knowledge of the alleged fraud
within a short time of the filing of the bill was shown by the

IcINTIRE v. PRYOR.
Opinion of the Court.

statements in the bill itself to be false, and that he had known
of the alleged fraud for over fifteen years, and that a number
of other matters alleged in the bill and amended bill were
shown by other contradictory statements to be false, and
thereby the whole claim was rendered suspicious; that there
were ambiguities in the bill, etc. Taking the whole case as
stated by the complainant himself, the court thought that the
bill had properly been dismissed by the court below. It is
evident that the bill was dismissed upon the ground that the
fraud was doubtfully or ambiguously alleged, the claim suspicious and that knowledge of the fraud had existed for a long
time.
We do not wish to be understood as holding that the plaintiff, even in the case of actual fraud, may wait an indefinite
time, or always so long as the statute of limitations would
permit him to bring an action at law before asserting his
rights; but where the fraud -is clearly proven, the court will
look with much more indulgence upon any disability under
which the plaintiff may labor as excusing his delay. As was
said in Townsend v. 7anderwerker, 160 U. S. 171, 186 "The
question of laches does not depend, as does the statute of limitation, upon the fact that a certain definite time has elapsed
since the cause of action accrued, but whether, under all the
circumstances of the particular case, plaintiff is chargeable
with a want of due diligence in failing to institute proceedings
before he did."
The circumstances of this case are so peculiar; the fraud
so glaring; the original and persistent intention of McIntire
through so many years to make himself the owner of the
property, so manifest; the utter disregard shown of the rights
of the plaintiff, as well as of Jenison, the mortgagee, upon
whose ignorance in the one case and whose confidence in
the other he imposed so successfully; the false personation of
Emma Taylor, and the fact that the decree in favor of the
plaintiff can do no possible harm to any innocent person,
demand of us an affirmance of the action of the Court of
Appeals. Its decree is accordingly
