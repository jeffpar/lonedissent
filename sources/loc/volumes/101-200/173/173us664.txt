OWENSBORO

NATIONAL

BANK v. OWENSBORO.

ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY.
1Eo. 148.

Argued February 27, 28, 199.-Decided April 3,1899.

A State is wholly without power to levy any tax, either direct or indirect,
upon national banks, their property, assets or franchises, except when
permitted so to do by the legislation of Congress.
Section 5219 of the Revised Statutes is the measure of the power of States
to tax national banks, their property or their franchises, that power
being confined to a taxation of the shares of stock in the names of the
shareholders, and to an assessment of the real estate of the bank.
The taxing law of the State of Kentucky, under the provisions of which
the tax in controversy in this case was imposed, is beyond the authority
conferred by Congress on the States, and is void for repugnancy to that
act.
The tax here complained of having been assessed on the franchise or intangible property of the corporation, was not within the purview of the
authority conferred by the act of Congress, and was therefore illegal.

THis suit was originally instituted in a court of the State of
Kentucky by the plaintiff in error, the Owensboro National
]Bank. The relief prayed was that the city of Owensboro
and its tax collector Simmons be perpetually restrained from
enforcing the collection of alleged "franchise" taxes for the
years 1893 and 1894, claimed by the defendants to have been
assessed under authority of a revenue act of the State of
Kentucky enacted November 11, 1892, as amended. The
taxes in question were laid upon the amount fixed by the
state board of valuation and assessment provided for in the
act, which valuation equalled the combined sum of the par
of the capital stock of the bank, its surplus and undivided

Statement of the Case.

profits. It is admitted on the record that the avails of the
bank to the amount of the valuation were invested in nontaxable bonds of the United States. Various reasons why'
the taxes should be declared illegal were urged in the petition and the amendments thereto. Without going into detail,
all the grounds are substantially included in the following
summary:
1. That the levy of the taxes in question impaired the
obligation of an alleged irrevocable contract entered into in
1886 between the bank and the State, and embodied in a
legislative enactment referred to as the Hewitt Act, which
contract was protected from impairment by the Constitution
of the United States;
2. That the taxes complained of were unlawful, because
they were not laid on the shares of stock in the names of the
shareholders, but were actually imposed on the property of
the bank, contrary to the act of Congress;
3. That if the taxes were not on the property of the bank,
then they were imposed on its franchise or right to do business, derived from the laws of the United States, which the
State was, under the law of the United States, without power
to tax either directly or indirectly;
4. That even if the taxes were otherwise valid, they were
unlawful, because discriminatory, inasmuch as certain state
banks whiph were incorporated prior to the year 1856 were
entitled to a low rate of taxation resulting from charter contracts, and it was illegal to tax national banks at a higher
rate than that assessed against the most favored state
bank;
5. That the law under which the taxes were levied and the
modes of procedure adopted in carrying the law into effect
operated to produce inequality in taxing the property of the
bank, to its disadvantage, as compared with other property
within the State, contrary to the state constitution;
6. That the rate of taxation imposed by the city of Owensboro for the year 1893 was in excess of that authorized by
the state constitution or laws;
7. That if the taxes complained of were considered laid,

OCTOBER TERINI 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

not upon the capital or franchise of the bank, but upon the
shares of stock in the names of the shareholders, then they
were discriminatory as against shareholders who were the
heads of families, as such shareholders were not permitted to
deduct from the assessment against their shares an exemption
authorized by a statute of the State in favor of the class of
individuals referred to;
8. That if the bank could be legally taxed upon its property
of any kind it was a foreign corporation as to the State of
Kentucky, and could only be taxed to the extent that its property was invested and had been earned in the city of Owensboro.
The petitions and the amendments thereto were demurred
to, and an answer filed reserving the demurrers. M otions
were made to dissolve a preliminary injunction which had
been allowed. On these motions testimony was heard. The
court dissolved the injunction and sustained the demurrers, and,
the plaintiff failing to plead further, the petition and amended
petitions were dismissed. On appeal the Court of Appeals of
the State of Kentucky affirmed the judgment of the lower
court, and the cause was then brought here for review.

Mr. JusTicE WHITE, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The claim of contract arising from the Hewitt Act need
not be considered, as it is disposed of adversely to the contentions of the plaintiff in error by the opinion expressed in Citizens' Savings Bank of Owensboro v. Owensboro, just decided.
We therefore dismiss that subject and the questions arising
from it from further consideration.
The other issues which the cause presents group themselves
under two distinct headings: First, a contention that the taxes

OWENSBORO NATIONAL BANK v. OWENSBORO.

667

Opinion of the Court.
levied were illegal, because imposed in violation of the act of
Congress regulating the method of taxation which the respective States may exert against national banks or their stockholders as such; second, because the taxes imposed are discriminatory.
This latter question has a twofold aspect, since some of the
charged discriminations are asserted to be in violation of the
act of Congress, and others are claimed to arise because of an
asserted contravention of the state law and constitution. Of
course, we are concerned only with the discrimination claimed
to constitute a violation of the law of the United States. We
need not, however, dissect the discriminations relied upon so
as to separate the Federal from the state questions in this regard, at least until we have disposed of the contention that the
taxes were levied upon the bank and its property in violation
of the laws of the United States, since if error in this regard
is found, the taxes will be illegal, and it will become unnecessary to determine whether they were discriminatory even
from a Federal aspect.
Were the taxes complained of levied upon the bank, its
property or franchise, and if so were they legal? is the question which then arises on the threshold of the case.
Two elements are involved in the determination of this question - that is, the extent of the power of the respective States
to tax national banks, and the ascertainment of the scope and
purport of the law by which the taxes complained of were
levied.
Early in the history of this Government, in cases affecting
the Bank of the United States, it was held that an agency,
such as that bank was adjudged to be, created for carrying
into effect national powers granted by the Constitution, was
not in its capital, franchises and operations subject to the taxing powers of a State. _M'Culloch v. Jzfarylan, 4 Wheat.
316; Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738.
The principles settled by the cases just referred to and
subsequent decisions were thus stated by this court in Davis
v. -EmiraSavings Bank, 161 U. S.283:
"1National banks are instrumentalities of the Federal Gov-

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

ernment, created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily
subject to the paramount authority of the United States. It
follows that an attempt, by a State, to define their duties or
control the conduct of their affairs is absolutely void, wherever such attempted exercise of authority expressly conflicts
with the laws of the United States, and either frustrates the
purpose of the national legislation or impairs the efficiency
of these agencies of the Federal Government to discharge the
duties, for the performance of which they were created.
These principles are axiomatic, and are sanctioned by the
repeated adjudications of this court."
It follows then necessarily from these conclusions that the
respective States would be wholly without power to levy any
tax, either direct or indirect, upon the national banks, their
property, assets or franchises, were it not for the permissive
legislation of Congress.
The first act providing for the organization of national
banks, passed February 25, 1863, c. 58, 12 Stat. 665, contained
no grant of power to the States to tax national banks in any
form whatever. Doubtless the far-reaching consequence to
arise from depriving the States of the source of revenue which
would spring from the taxation of such banks, and the error
of not conferring the power to tax, early impressed itself
upon Congress; for the following year, act of June 3, 1864,
c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, power was granted to the States, not to
tax the banks, their franchises or property, but to tax the
shares of stock in the names of the shareholders. This provision subsequently was amended and supplemented in various
particulars, act of February 4, 1868, c. 6, 15 Stat. 341, and the
result of this legislation is embodied in section 5219 of the
Revised Statutes, which is as follows:
"SE . 5219. Nothing herein shall prevent all the shares
in any association from being included in the valuation of
the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares,
in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the State within
which the association is located; but the legislature of each
State may determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the shares of national banking associations located

OWENSBORO NATIONAL BANLK v. OWENSBORO.

669

Opinion of the Court.

within the State, subject only to the two restrictions, that
the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed
upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens
of such State, and that the shares of any national banking
association owned by non-residents of any State shall be
taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not
elsewhere. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the
real property of associations from either state, county or
municipal taxes, to the same extent, according to its value, as
other real property is taxed."
This section, then, of the Revised Statutes is the measure
of the power of a State to tax national banks, their property
or their franchises. By its unambiguous provisions the power
is confined to a taxation of the shares of stock in the names
of the shareholders and to an assessment of the real estate of
the bank. Any state tax therefore which is in excess of and
not in conformity to these requirements is void.
So self-evident are these conclusions that the adjudicated
cases justify the deduction that they have been accepted from
the beginning as axiomatic and unquestioned, since the controversies as to taxation of national banks illustrated in the
opinions of this court mainly depend, not upon any attempted
exercise of a power to tax the property and franchises of the
banks, but involved controversies as to whether, when the
shares of the stock in the names of the shareholders had been
assessed according to law, the tax could be imposed upon them
because of alleged discrimination or other illegalities.
Does then the Kentucky statute tax the shares of stock in
the names of the shareholders, or does it impose a tax upon
the bank, its property or franchise?
Without undertaking to recapitulate the provisions of the
Kentucky statutes, in virtue of which the taxes here in question were imposed, we content ourselves with reiterating, in
the margin,' the statement of the taxing statutes of Kentucky

made by the court in Adams Express Convpan.y v. Kentycky,
166 U. S. 171, 175, et seq.
The effect of the statutory provisions contained in the third
article contains the general provisions relating to the assessment and collection of taxes 'upon all property.' Sections 4019 and 4020 are as follows:
' SFc. 4019. An annual tax of forty-two and one-half cents upon each one
hundred dollars of value of all property directed to be assessed for taxation,
as hereinafter provided, shall be paid by the owner, person or corporation
assessed. The aggregate amount of tax realized by all assessments shall
be for the following purposes : Fifteen (15) cents for the ordinary expenses
of the government; five (5) cents for the use of the sinking fund; twentytwo (22) cents for the support of the common schools, and one-half of one
cent for the Agricultural and TMechanical College, as now provided by law,
by an act entitled "An act for the benefit of the Agricultural and Iechanical College," approved April twenty-ninth, one thousand eight hundred and
eighty, including the necessary travelling expenses of all pupils of the State
entitled to free tuition in said college, and who continue students for the
period of ten months, unless unavoidably prevented.
' SEC. 4020. All real and personal estate within this State, and all personal
estate of persons residing in this State, and of all corporations organized
under the laws of this State, whether the property be in or out of the State,
including intangible property, which shall be considered and estimated in
fixing the value of corporate franchises as hereinafter provided, shall be
subject to taxation, unless the same be exempt from taxation by the constitution, and shall be assessed at its fair cash value, estimated at the price
it would bring at a fair voluntary sale.'
Article two relates to the assessment of property by the assessors, to
whom every person in the Commonwealth must give in a list of all his property under oath.
Section 4058 provides for schedules with interrogatories to be propounded
to each person, ' with affidavit thereto attached, to be signed and sworn to
by the person whose property is assessed.' The schedules contain a long list
of items, including all forms of tangible and intangible, real, personal and
mixed property; the enumeration being exceedingly minute. The first eleven
items relate to bonds, notes secured by mortgage, other notes, accounts, cash
on hand, cash on deposit in bank, cash on deposit with other corporations,
cash on deposit with individuals, all other credits or money at interest, stock
in joint stock companies or associations, stock in foreign corporations.
The third article covers the assessment of corporations, corporations generally, banks and trust companies, building and loan associations, turnpikes.
Sections 4077, 4078, 4079, 4080, 4081, 4082 and 4091 are as follows:
'Sac. 4077. Every railway company or corporation, and every incorporated bank, trust company, guarantee or security company, gas company,

which are provided for in section 4095 of this article, the place or places
where such local taxes are to be paid by other corporations on their franchises, and how apportioned, where more than one jurisdiction is entitled
to a share of such tax, shall be determined by the board of valuation and

the value of all other assets; the total amount of indebtedness as principal,
the amount of gross or net earnings or income, including interest on investments, and incomes from all other sources for twelve months next
preceding the fifteenth day of September of the year in which the statement is required; the amount and kind of tangible property in this State,

extend beyond the limits of this State, the said board will fix the value of
the capital stock as hereinbefore provided, and that proportion of the value
of the capital stock, which the length of the lines operated, owned, leased or

value of the corporate franchise of such corporation liable for taxation in
this State; and such corporate franchise shall be liable to taxation in each
county, incorporated city, town or district through, or into which, such
lines pass or are operated, in the same proportion that the length of the
line in such county, city, town or district bears to the whole length of lines
in the State, less the value of any tangible property assessed, or liable to
assessment, in any such county, city, town or taxing district.
' SEc. 4082. Whenever any person or association of persons, not being
a corporation nor having capital stock, shall, in this State, engage in the
business of any of the corporations mentioned in the first section of this

of the rights or interests of the holders thereof in the business or capital
and property employed therein, shall be deemed and treated as the capital
stock of such person or association of persons for the purposes of taxation

thirty days' notice, shall be deemed delinquent, and a penalty of ten per
cent on the amount of the tax shall attach, and thereafter such tax shall
bear interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum ; any such corporation,
company or association failing to pay its taxes, penalty and interest, after
becoming delinquent, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on
conviction, shall be fined fifty dollars for each day the same remains unpaid,

with the provisions of the constitution of Kentucky in
reference to taxation."
In the Express com2pany case the court said (pp. 180, 181)
"Taking the whole act together, and in view of the provisions of sections 4078 to 4081, we agree with the Circuit
Court that it is evident that the word 'franchise' was not
employed in a technical sense, and that the legislative intention is plain that the entire property, tangible and intangible,
of all foreign and domestic corporations, and all foreign and
domestic companies possessing no franchise, should be valued
as an entirety, the value of the tangible property be deducted,
and the value of the intangible property thus ascertained be
taxed under these provisions; and as to railroad, telegraph,
telephone, express, sleeping car, etc., companies, whose lines
extend beyond the limits of the State, that their intangible property should be assessed on the basis of the mileage of their
lines within and without the State.

There is noth-

ing in the statute which exempts any intangible property
owned by any corporation, company or individual taxpayer
from taxation, or discriminates between them.

.

The

tax mentioned in section 4077 is not an additional tax upon
the same property, but on intangible property which has not
been taxed as tangible property."
True it is, since the decision referred to, the Court of Appeals of the State of Kentucky has, it is asserted in the case
of Louisville Tobacco Warehouse Company v. Commonwealth,
on a rehearing, 49 S. W. Rep., examined the terms of section
4077, and is stated to have said:
"The latter clause, ' also every other corporation, company
or association having or exercising any special or exclusive
state board of equalization to equalize the assessments returned to them
from each county."

By section 4092, banks and trust companies are required to file the report referred to in section 4078 by a date named. The section also prescribed when taxes are payable, and that upon failure to file the reports
" or to pay said taxes, said banks and trust companies shall be subjected
to the same fines and penalties as prescribed in section fifteen (4091) of
this article."

Opinion of the Court.

privilege or franchise not allowed by law to natural persons,
or performing any public service,' seems to us to have been
added for the purpose of including such corporations as were
not strictly ejusdem generis with the companies previously
enumerated, but which might possess exclusive privileges;
and, as a provision for the future, to impose the intangible
property tax upon corporations to be thereafter created, which
might have exclusive privileges, or perform public services.
"The only authority relied upon in support of the contention that this language includes all corporations is the case
of Western Union Telegrapjh Con~pany v. Norman, 77 Fed.
IRep. 27. But that case was in relation to a company specificallyi named in the statute under consideration. The question
here presented did not arise in that, and was, presumably,
not argued; and the suggestion made by the learned judge
who delivered that opinion was made in argument in reaching a conclusion, to reach which the dictum cited was not
necessary."
In deciding that the conviction of the corporation for wilfully failing to file with the state auditor the statement required by the Kentucky Statutes, sections 4077 and 4078, was
erroneous, the court in that case, it is also stated, has, moreover, further observed:
"Nor can the appellant corporation be said to have any intangible property subject to taxation under this statute. Its
tangible property-its warehouse, drays and personal property -is of no greater value in the hands of the corporation
than it would be if owned and managed by the natural persons who are its stockholders. This is also true of its choses
in action, etc. The value of its capital stock must necessarily
be the value of its tangible property, choses in action, etc.
It had no intangible property subject to taxation under the
statute, and, as matter of law, could have none. . . . The
revenue law of the State is not unconstitutional because it
does not require natural persons, possessing no special franchise or privilege, to make report of special privileges and
franchises for taxation; nor is it unconstitutional in failing to
require a report from all classes of corporations which can

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

possess the intangible property sought to be taxed by this
statute. The tax upon tangible property of all corporations
is elsewhere provided for."
The opinion, however, from which the foregoing extracts
are made, has not as yet been reported. But, if the Court of
Appeals of Kentucky has given to the state statute the construction indicated, the ruling does not affect the present case,
as banks are specifically mentioned in the statute.
The tax then, as defined in the law, as interpreted by the
Court of Appeals of Kentucky and by this court in the opinions from which we have excerpted, is a tax nominally on the
franchise of the corporation, but in reality a tax on all the intangible property of the corporation. The proposition then
comes to this: Nothing but the shares of stock in the hands
of the shareholders of a national bank can be taxed, except
the real estate of the bank. The taxes which are here resisted
are not taxes levied upon the shares of stock in the names of
the shareholders, but are taxes levied on the franchise or intangible property of the corporation. Thus, bringing the two
conclusions together, there would seem to be no escape in reason from the proposition that the taxing law of the State of
Kentucky is beyond the authority conferred by the act of Congress, and is therefore void for repugnancy to such act.
It is, however, urged that whilst the taxes may not be in
form imposed on the shares of stock in the names of the
shareholders, and may be in form a tax on the franchise or
property of the bank, nevertheless they are equivalent to a tax
on the shares of stock in the names of the shareholders, and
therefore do not violate the act of Congress. But this proposition concedes that the taxing statute does not conform to the
act of Congress, and yet invokes its permissive authority, since,
as already shown, without the grant made by the act of Congress there would be no power to tax at all. Passing, nevertheless, this contradiction, and looking beneath the mere form,
we come to the substance of things. The alleged equivalency,
in order to be of any cogency, must of necessity contain two
distinct and essential elements - equivalency in law and equivalency in fact. Does it contain either? is the question.

OWENSBORO NATIONAL BANK v. OWENSBORO.

677

Opinion of the Court.

To be equivalent in law, involves the proposition that a tax
on the franchise and property of a bank or corporation is the
equivalent of a tax on the shares of stock in the names of
the shareholders. But this proposition has been frequently
denied by this court, as to national banks, and has been overruled to subh an extent in many other cases relating to exemptions from taxation, or to the power of the States to tax,
that to maintain it now would have the effect to annihilate
the authority to tax in a multitude of cases, and as to vast
sums of property upon which the taxing power is exerted in
virtue of the decisions of this court holding that a tax on a
corporation or its property is not the legal equivalent of a tax
on the stock, in the names of the stockholders. A brief review
of the two classes of cases, by which the doctrines just stated
are overwhelmingly established, will make the foregoing result
clear.
The earliest case in the reports of this court is Van Allen v.
The Assessors, (1865) 3 Wall. 573. The tax was on the shares
of stock in the names of the shareholders, pursuant to the act
of Congress. Two issues were presented, one, the assertion
that the state banks were assessed on their capital and surplus,
and therefore that stockholders in national banks were substantially discriminated against. This was held to be well
taken; clearly, therefore, deciding that there was no equivalency between taxing the capital and surplus in the hands of
the bank and taxing shares in the names of the shareholders,
for if the two had been equivalent the decision would necessarily have been otherwise. The other question in the case was
thus stated by the court, through Mr. Justice Nelson, page 581:
"The main and important question involved, and the one
which has been argued at great length and with eminent
ability, is, whether the State possesses the power to authorize the taxation of the shares of these national banks in the
hands of stockholders, whose capital is wholly vested in stock
and bonds of the United States."
This question was examined, and it was decided that, as the
shares of stock in the hands of the shareholders were distinct
and different subjects-matter of taxation from the property or

Opinion of the Court.

rights of the bank, that therefore the power conferred by Congress could be exercised so as to tax the shareholders even although the property of the bank was invested in non-taxable
bonds of the United States, because the two were distinct and
different things.
It is to be remarked that it is patent from th6 opinion of
the court that, if the shares of stock had been considered as
in anywise the equivalent of the bonds, in which the property
of the bank was invested, the tax would have been held invalid, despite the authority to tax the stock given by the act
of Congress, as such authority would not have been construed
as authorizing a violation of the faith of the United States by
taxing bonds issued by the Government which were not subject
to taxation. It follows then that not only did this decision
refute the claim of equivalency between the tax on the bank
or its property or franchises and the tax on the stock in the
names of the stockholders, but by a negative affirmative it
demonstrates that if the two are equivalent the tax in this
case would be illegal, since the record here admits that a
sum, at least the equivalent of the capital, surplus and undivided profits of the bank, was invested in bonds of the
United States. The contention of equivalency then destroys
itself, and if it were conceded would bring about the illegality
of the tax, in support of the legality of which the argument
is advanced.
Following this came the decision in People v. Tax Commissioners, (1866) 4 Wall. 244, in which, reiterating the decision
in 'an Allen v. The Assessors, it was held, because the property of the bank was distinct and separate from the shares of
stock in the names of the shareholders, therefore the latter
were not entitled to deduct exempt property belonging to the
bank from the assessment on their shares. The court said,
again through Mr. Justice Nelson, and in part quoting from
the opinion in the Van Allen case, (p. 258):
The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of
the bank, real and personal; and within the powers conferred
upon it by the charter, and for the purposes for which it was
created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as

OWENSBORO NATIONAL BANK v. OWENSBORO.

Opinion -of the Court.

a private individual can deal with his own. . . . The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net
profits earned by the bank, in the employment of its capital,
during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the numnber of his shares; and upon its dissolution or termination, to
his proportion of the property that may remain, of the corporation, after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct,
independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like
any other property that may belong to him;' and, we add, of
course, is subject to like taxation."
The next case in order of time is Bradley v. The People,
(1866) 4 Wall. 459. The question which the case presented
was whether a tax on the property or rights of the bank was
the legal equivalent of a tax on the shares of stock in the
names of the shareholders. The argument of counsel was
that in determining this question the method was immaterial,
but the substance would be considered. The argument urged
(p. 460): "Neither the National Government, the creator of
the species of property now taxed, nor the shareholders can
be interested in the methods which may be adopted by the
State for the imposition of the tax." The court, through Mr.
Justice Nelson, after referring to the decision in 'an Allen
v. The Assessors, and the tax there imposed, said (p. 462):
"It was in that case attempted to be sustained on the same
ground relied on here, that the tax on the capital was equivalent to tax on the shares, as respected the shareholders.
But the position was answered that, admitting it to be so,
yet, inasmuch as the capital of the state banks may consist
of the bonds of the United States, which were exempt from
state taxation, it was not easy to see that the tax on the
capital was an equivalent to a tax on the shares."
In N5ational Bank v. Commonwealth, (1870) 9 Wall. 353, a
statute of the State of Kentucky which imposed a tax of fifty
cents a share on bank stock, or stock in any moneyed corporation, of loan or discounts, owned by individuals, corporations or societies, was held to authorize a tax on the shares
of the stockholders, as distinguished from the capital of the
bank invested in Federal securities, and this, although the tax

was collected from the bank instead of the individual stockholders. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice
Miller, a summary statement was made of the doctrine enunciated in the prior decisions recognizing the distinction
between the property owned by an incorporated bank as a
corporate entity and the property or interest of the stockholders in such bank, commonly called a share.
These cases, interpreting the act of Congress, have never
been questioned, and indeed form the basis upon which the
taxation of the shares of stock in the names of the shareholders allowed by the act of Congress has been made effica-

cious for the purpose of bringing a vast amount of property
within the taxing power of the States, which would have
been excluded had not the principles which the cases
announced been established. If the postulate upon which
they necessarily rest be overthrown by saying that there is
an equivalency between the taxation of the property
of the bank and the shares of stock in the names of
the stockholders, it would follow that the principles upheld
by the cases would disappear with the destruction of the
reasons upon which they were placed. It would then
necessarily follow that the grant by Congress of authority
to tax the shares of stock in the names of the shareholders
could not be exercised where the bank held bonds of the
United States exempt from taxation ; that the two things
being the same, the shareholders would be entitled to deduct
the property of the bank from the sum of the taxation of the
shares; in other words, that the right to tax the shareholders
would be a vain thing.
It has been suggested that other cases decided since the
cases referred to, whilst not questioning the latter, in effect
admit a doctrine which tends to a contrary result. We do
not stop to review in detail the cases from which this result
is claimed to arise. They are: Palmel, v. ifc2Eahon, 133 U. S.
660 ; Bank of Redemption v. Boston, 125 U. S. 60 ; Davenport
-Hational Bank v. Davenport Board of Equalization, 123

tion. In all the cases referred to the taxation was specifically
imposed on the shares of stock in the name of the shareholders, and the question presented, in various forms, was
whether the provisions of state taxing laws, created a discrimination in favor of other moneyed capital and against
the shareholders in national banks, contrary to the act of
Congress. On these questions, interpreting the act of Congress
with the liberality of construction resorted to in the Fan
Allen case and those which followed it, the court in most of
the instances rejected the charge of discrimination. The
result of the cases in question tended to give efficient vitality
to the grant of Congress to tax the shares of stock in the
names of the shareholders. The argument now relied on
would, if it were adopted, operate to destroy the power to
tax, which the act of Congress sanctions.
It cannot be doubted that, as a general principle, it is settled
that the taxation of the property, franchises and rights of a
corporation is one thing and the taxation of the shares of stock
in the names of the shareholders is another and different one.
This doctrine has been applied to sanction the taxation of the
one where the other was covered by a contract of exemption.
As the result of its application, it is unquestioned that much
property has been brought within the range of the taxing
power which otherwise would have escaped taxation- It is
unnecessary to multiply citations on this subject, as the question has been in recent cases reviewed and restated fully by
the court. Thus, in Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, 161 U. S.
134, 146, it was said, through Mr. Justice Peckham:
"The capital stock of a corporation and the shares into
which such stock may be divided and held by individual
shareholders are two distinct pieces of property. The capital
stock and the shares of stock in the hands of the shareholders
may both be taxed, and it is not double taxation. ('an -Allen
v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; People v. Commissioners, 4 Wall.
244, cited in .Farringtonv. Tennessee, 95 U. S. 687.)
"This statement has been reiterated many times in various
decisions by this court, and is not now disputed by any one.
In the case last cited Mr. Justice Swayne, in delivering the

opinion of the court, enumerated many objects liable to be
taxed other than the capital stock of a corporation, and
among them he instanced, (1) the franchise to be a corporation; (2) the accumulated earnings; (3) profits and dividends;
(4) real estate belonging to the corporation and necessary for
its business; and he adds that 'this enumeration shows the
searching and comprehensive taxation to which such institutions are subjected where there is no protection by previous
compact.' And in Tennessee v. TWitworth, 117 U. S. 129,
at page 136, Yr. Chief Justice Waite, in delivering the opinion
of the court, says: ' That in corporations four elements of taxable value are sometimes found: First, the franchise; second,
the capital stock in the hands of the corporation; third, the
corporate property; and, fourth, the shares of capital stock
in the hands of the individual stockholders.'
"The surplus belonging to this bank is ' corporate property,'
and is distinct from the capital stock in the hands of the corporation. The exemption, in terms, is upon the payment of an
annual tax of one half of one per cent upon each share of the
capital stock, which shall be in lieu of all other taxes. The
exemption is not, in our judgment, greater in its scope than
the subject of the tax."
And, in the case of 3LVew Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, 167
U. S. 371, although it was held that the capital of the bank
was exempt from taxation by a charter contract, and that,
owing to the peculiar provisions of the charter, it would
violate the contract to compel the bank to pay a tax levied
on its shareholders, nevertheless the exemption did not preclude the levy of a tax upon the stock in the names of the
stockholders, the court said (p. 402):
"The doctrine that an exemption of the capital of a corporation does not, of necessity, include the exemption of the shareholders on their shares of stock is now too well settled to be
questioned."
There being then no equivalency between the assessment
of the bank and'the assessment of the shares in the names of
the shareholders, it follows that the tax here complained of,
which was assessed on the franchise or intangible property

Opinion of the Court.

of the corporation, was not within the purview of the authority conferred by the act of Congress, and was therefore
illegal.
Whilst this conclusion suffices to dispose of the case, we
advert to the contention that although there may not be a
legal equivalency, there is nevertheless one in fact, and therefore the tax should be sustained. It may be that in the case
before us, there is a coincidence between the sum of the tax
levied upon the corporation and the amount which would
have been imposed had the shares of stock in the names of
the shareholders been assessed according to the act of Congress. But that this is not the necessary result of the taxing
statute is too plain to require comment. The fact that it is
not is well illustrated by Henderson Bridge Com~pany v. Kentucky, sup'a, for there the tax which was sustained on the
franchise or intangible property of the corporation admittedly
enormously exceeded the total of the capital stock, and proceeded upon the theory that the bonds issued by the corporation were an element to be taken into consideration in fixing
the value of the franchise or intangible property. If the
mere coincidence of the sum of the taxation is to be allowed
to frustrate the provisions of the act of Congress, then that
act becomes meaningless and the power to enforce it in any
given case will not exist. This follows since if mere coincidence of amount and not legal power be the test, only a pure
question of fact would arise in any given case. The argument
that public policy exacts that where there is an equality inamount between an unlawful tax and a lawful one, the unlawful tax should be held valid, does not strike us as worthy of
serious consideration.

ment, as interpreted, settled policies of taxation have been
evolved embracing large amounts of property which would not
otherwise be taxable, and which, as we have seen, will escape
taxation if the past development of the system be destroyed
by recognizing, without reason, a principle inconsistent with
the law and destructive of the safeguards which it imposes.

Syllabus.

From the foregoing conclusions, it results that as the taxes
were imposed upon the bank and its property or franchise,
and not upon the shares of stock in the name of the stockholders, such taxes were void, and

LAKE SHORE AND MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RAIL-

WAY COMPANY v. S.MITH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN .
NO. 227. Argued March 14,15, 1699.-Decided April 17, 1699.

The provision in the act of the legislature of 'Michigan, No. 90, of the year
1891, amending the general railroad law, that one thousand-mile tickets
shall be kept for sale at the principal ticket offices of all railroad companies in this State or carrying on business partly within and partly without the limits of the State, at a price not exceeding twenty dollars in the
Lower Peninsula and twenty-five dollars in the Upper Peninsula; that
such one thousand-mile tickets may be made non-transferable, but whenever required by the purchaser they shall be issued in the names of the
purchaser, his wife and children, designating the name of each on such
ticket, and in case such ticket is presented by any other than the person or
persons named thereon, the conductor may take it up and collect fare, and
thereupon such one thousand-mile ticket shall be forfeited to the railroad company; that each one thousand-mile ticket shall be valid for two
years only after date of purchase, and in case it is not wholly used within
the time, the company issuing the same shall redeem the unused portion
thereof, if presented by the purchaser for redemption within thirty days
after the expiration of such time, and shall on such redemption be entitled to charge three cents per mile for the portion thereof used, is a violation of that part of the Constitution of the United States which forbids the taking of property without due process of law, and requires the
equal protection of the laws.
In so holding the court is not thereby interfering with the power of the legislature over railroads, as corporations or common carriers, to so legislate as to fix maximum rates, to prevent extortion or undue charges, and
to promote the safety, health, convenience or proper protection of the
public; but it only says that the particular legislation in review in this
