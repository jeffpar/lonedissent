KANSAS CITY, LAWRENCE, AND SOUTH KANSAS RAILROAD .COMPANY v. THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIROUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF-

ANSAS.

Argued October 18,19, 18M6.-Decided November 8, 188.

The acts of Congress of March 8, 1863, 12 Stat. 772; July 1, 1864, 13 Stat.
839; and July 26, 1866; 14 Stat. 289, granting lands to the State of Kansas
for railroad purposes, are to be construed in pari materia,and as having
the one purpose of building a single road from Fort Riley, down the Neosho
Valley, to the southern line of that State, and not as distinct grants for
different roads, which may come in conflict in the claims under them in re-'
gard to the lands granted..
The junction of this road with the one from-Leavenworth by way of Lawrence,
in the direction of Galveston Bay, as provided in the act of 1863, was not
required to be on the very crest of the Neosho Valley, as reached by the
latter road, but at a convenient point f6r such crossing in the narrow valley
of the Neoslio River; and as this point has been adopted by the companies
building both roads, and accepted by the officers of the Land Department
in selecting indemnity lands, there is no sufficient reason to be found in the
point of junction to vacate the certification of these lands to th6 State for
the company Nyhich has built the road and received the patents of the State.
Nor is there any.'ther sufficient reason found in the record in this case for setting aside the evidences of title to these lands issued to the corporation
which built the road within the time required by law, to the approval of
the officers of the government, whose primary duty it was to certify these
lands, and who did so within the scope of their powers.

This was a bill 'in equity brought by the Attorney General
of the United States, to quiet the title to certain lands in Kan-

sas. The decree bplow was in favor of the Attorney General,
from which the railroad company appealed. The case is stated
in the opinion of the court.
-Yr. George W. .erary, .ir. John F. Dillon and .Xv. A.
T. Britton (Mr. James Hagerman and -Mr. A. B. Browne
were with them on the brief), for appellant.
-Yrr. William 1awrence (representing settliers), for appellee,
argued the following general propositions:
First Pro~position.-Theclaim of title under: (1) The landgrant act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 72; (2) The Kansas
act of February 9, 1864, accepting the grant of said act of
Congress; (3) The patent issued by the Governor of Kansas
to the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Company. The defendant,
as grantee of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Company, has
no title under these.
Second Proposition.-The court cannot support the patent,
or any claim of title, by ignoring the statutes and proceedings
recited in the patent as the authority for issuing it, and by
reference to other statutes or proceedings, dehors,,even if by
possibility the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of
Kansas might have considered them and made them available
to give title, when, in fact, if they considered them, they rejected them, and refused to give title under them.
Third Proposition.-Theassignment made March 19, 1866,
to the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad Company, by the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa F6 Railroad Company, of its
right to build the. Emporia Branch, with its franchises and
land rights connected therewith, and the construction of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas road as made, give no right to
any indemnity lands-no authority to make a selection thereof.
The resolution of the Legislature of Kansas of February 26,
1867, ratifying said assignment, is void.
tFourth Proo&ition.-If the assignment by the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa F4 Company to the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Company is valid, yet the latter company acquired no
title under the act of 1863 to the lands in controversy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Citations for Appellee.

Tifth Proosition.-The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Company never acquired any legal or equitable title to any of the
lands now in controversy, under or by virtue of the act of July
26, 1866.
Sixth Proposition.-Itis submitted that th8 lands in controversy are not subject to any land grant, because included in
the New York Indian Reservation under the treaty of January 15, 1838, never legally revoked.

M . JusTIOP MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of the District of
Kansas. The suit is brought by B. H. Brewster, Attorney

I OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

General of the United States, for and on behalf of the United
States. The object of it is to set aside certain instruments in
writing, which, if they are valid, are supposed to convey title
from the United States for a considerable quantity of land in
southeastern Kansas.
An act of Congress, approved July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 289,
granted to the State of Kansas "every alternate section
of land or parts thereof designated by odd numbers to the
extent of five alternate sections per mile on each side of the
road, and not exceeding in all ten sections per mile;
for the purpose of aiding the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Southern Branch, the same being a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Kansas, to construct and operate
a railroad from Fort Riley, Kansas, or near that military reservation, thence down the valley of the INeosho River to the
southern line of the State of Kansas, with a view to an extension of the same throughl a portion of the Indian Territory to
Fort Smith, Arkansas.

.

.

There is the usual clause in this grant providing that if
"it shall appear that the United States have, when the line of
said road is definitely located, sold any section or any part
thereof, granted as aforesaid, or that the right of preemption
or homestead settlement has attached to the -same, or that the
same has been reserved by the United States for any purpose
whatever, then it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to cause to be selected for the purposes aforesaid, from
the public lands of the United States nearest-to the sections
above specified, so much land as shall be equal to the amount
of such lands as the United States have sold, reserved, or otherwise appropriated, or to which the right of homestead settlement or preemption has attached as aforesaid, which lands,
thus indicated by the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,
shall be reserved and held for the State of Kansas for the use
of said company by the said Secretary, for the purpose of the
construction and operation of said railroad, as provided by this
act."
This railroad company, for whose benefit the gant was
made to the State: of Kansas, afterwards changed its name, by

KAN. CITY, &c., R. R. CO. ,. ATTORNEY GENERAL, 687
Opinion of the Court.

a valid procedure, into that of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas
Railroad Company. Under this latter name it built the road
contemplated by this grant, which was completed in due
time, and asserted a claim before the Commissioner of the
General Land Office for the lands now in question as indemnity for others lost by the previous sale, appropriation, or
other disposition of them under the clause above cited in the
act of 1866. These lands were on that demand certified to the
State of Kansas, and by the State patented to the railroad
company. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad Company afterwards, for a valuable consideration, conveyed them
to the appellant in the present case, the Kansas City, Lawrence
and Southern Kansas Railroad Company.
The object of this suit is to vacate and declare void the certification of the lands by the Secretary of the Interior to the
State of Kansas, as well as the patents issued by that State to
the railroad company. There is no allegation of fraud, accident, or mistake, except as the alleged want of authority or
power in the officers of the United States to certify these lands
to that State may be a*mistake in law. Unquestionably, if
there was no such power, the government has a right by this
proceed'ng to have those instruments declared void and set
aside as a cloud upon its title. The authority of the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the
Interior to make this certificatioA of the lands to that State
for the benefit of this company depends upon the true construction of this act of 1866, and of certain other statutes on
the same subject.
Since the railroad company has constructed the road as contemplated by the statute, and has received the patents for the
lands found in place along the line of this road, that is to say,
every alternate section, of odd numbers, which had not been
previously disposed of, and as the officers of the government
have certified the lands now in controversy to be properly
selected in lieu of suca as were not found in place, it would seem
to devolve upon the Plaintiffs to show some reason why this
authority has not been properly exercised, for the statute declares that the Secretary shall indicate thee indemnity lands.

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

It was his primary duty, and that of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, to ascertain whether any lands, and, if so,
what amount, were not found subject to the act by reason of
previous disposition under the homestead or preemption laws
or reservations, and to select the indemnity lands. They have
accordingly, both in the bill and in argument. set up the facts
which they suppose to show the invalidity of these transfers.
The first of these, and the most important, is, that by an act
of arch 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 772, and a supplementary act of
July 1, 1864, 13 Stat. 339, these lands became appropriated to
the building of another road through the same region of countrf and through the same lands, the grant being to the State
of Kansas for the purpose of building that road. It is argued
that these grants, instead of being made by Congress in aid of
one and the same road, are different and conflicting grants,
and that the earlier grants of 1863 and 1864 prevent the M.,
K. & T. R. R. Co. from realizing the bounty of Congress on
that subject, because there is in the grant to the State for the
benefit of the Union P acific Railroad Company, Southern
Branch, an express reservation of 'any lands granted previously for railroad purposes. The language of the act of
1866 on this subject is as follows:
"Provided, that any and all lands heretofore reserved to the
United States by any act of Congress, or in any other manner
by competent auithority, for the purpose of aiding in any' object of internal improvement, or for any other purpose whatsoever, be, an& the same are hereby, reserved to the United
States from the operations of this act, except so far as it may
be found necessary to locate the routes of said road and
branches through such reserved lands, in which case the right
of way only shall be granted, subject to the approval of the
President of the United States."
As the lands granted by the prior acts of 1863 and 1861
had, by the act of the Legislature of Kansas, been granted to
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa F4 Railroad Company, a then
existing corporation of that State, for the purpose of building
a road, with the same general description as to its course down
the valley of the Neosho River, which might have run through
-

KAN. CITY, &c., R. R. CO. v. ATTORNEY GENERAL. 689
Opinion of the Court.

these same lands if it had been built by the latter company, it
is argued with great earnestness that these lands were'necessarily reserved, under this clause of the act of 1866, from the,
grant, as being reserved by the authority of Congress for the
purpose of aiding in that object of internal improvement. If
the A., T. & S. F. R. R. Co. had built a line of road along the
same general course and through the shme lands, twenty miles
in width, that the M., K. & T. R. R. Co. has occupied with its
road, and asserted a claim to these lands, or to any of them,
the argument would be almost irresistible.
If, at the time that the act of 1866 was passed, the A., T. &
S. F. R. R. Co., or any other company than the one to which
the grant of 1866 was made, was intending to build a road, or
expected to build one, or had any authority from the State of
Kansas to build one, under the acts of 1863 and 1864, the
argument would have force. But on tho 9th day of March,
1866, which was four months prior to the act of 1866, the A.,
T. & S. F. R. R. Co. entered into an agreement with the U. P.
IR. R. Co., Southern Branch (afterwards known as the M., K. &
T. R. I. Co.), by which the latter company assumed all the
obligations of the former in regard to building the road which
that company had assumed in accepting the grant by the
State of Kansas, in consideration of which the A., T. & S. F.
:R. IR. Co. assigned to the U. P. R. R. Co., Southern Branch,
all its right, title, and interest in'the lands appropriated to the
building of that road by the acts of March 3, 1863, and July
1, 1864, and by the acts of the Kansas Legislature conferring
these lands on that company. So that, with the exception of
the ratification of this agreement and assignment by the State
of Kansas, and so far as the two railroad companies themselves could make such an assignment, the IT. P. R. R. Co.,
Southern Branch, to whom the grant of 1866 was made, had,
before the passage of that act, become possessed of all the
rights existing under the acts of 1863 and 1864 with regard to
building a railroad down the Neosho valley.
It is not to be supposed that Congress was ignorant of this
transaction, nor that, if the representatives in Congress of the
State of Kansas had been opposed to this transfer, they would
vOL. cxvni--44

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

have consented to the passage of the act of 1866. ]But, as that
State did ratify this transfer by the one company to the other
within six or eight months after it was made, it is reasonable
to suppose that Congress, in legislating upon such an important grant of public lands for public uses, did not intend to
have two parallel roads for a long distance within the narrow
strip of the Neosho Valley, but did intend by all this legislation to secure one road, and, being aware of the transfer by
the A., T. & S. F. R. R. Co. to the U. P. Ra. IR.Co., Southern
Branch, and of the willingness of the State of Kansas, when
her legislature could meet, to ratify that transfer, designed by
the act of 1866 to place also in the hands of the latter company the same right and the same grant for the same purposes, and for the one road.
In supporof this view it will be seen that, in the later act
of 1866, Congress, departing from the principle of the former
acts of making the grant directly to the State without prescribing by what means or by what corporations it should construct the road, declares expressly that the grant is made to the
State of Kansas for the benefit of the U. P. R. R.Co., Southern
Branch, and it did this obviously for the purpose of consolidating all these grants into one grant in the hands of that company, which already had all the rights vested by the other
statutes necessary to enable it to build this road down the
Neosho Valley.
The history of the legislation of Congress and of the State
of Kansas on this subject almost conclusively shows that the
several statutes are to be taken and construed as in pari
materia, and that the only object was the building of one
road. By the act of 1866 there was no grant in aid of any
other road but that one. The act of 1863 made the grant to
the State of Kansas for the purpose of aiding in the construe'tion of a road from the city of Atchison, by way of Topeka,
the capital of the State, to the western line of the State, with,
a branch ftom where this road crosses the _eoeho, down the

valley of that river to the point where a road from Leavenworth and Lawrence south, for which a grant was made in the
same act, crosses the Neosho Valley. In this act no corpora-

Opinion of the Court.

tion is named, but it was left to thei State, fo which the grant
was in terms made, to emplqy such agency in the way of a
corporation, private individuals, or ts own officers, for the
building of the road, as it might ch ose. This point of intersection with the Neosho River was some distance south of
Fort Riley, through which the main branch of the U. P. R. R.,
Eastern Division, passed on its way from the Missouri River
to the Pacific Coast, and was at or near the town of Emporia.
In 1864 Congress passed an act making an additional grant of
lands to the State for a railroad from Emporia, by way of
Council Grove, to a point near Fort Riley, on the branch
Union Pacific Railroad in said State. Both of these acts were
accepted by the State of Kansas, and both the lands granted,
and the right to build the roads mentione4 in these acts of
-Congress were conferred upon thd A., T. & S. F. R. R. Co. by
the State. These two pieces of road, if ever they were built,
would necessarily constitute one continuous road from Fort
Riley down the Neosho Valley to the point where the road
should cross the line of the Leavenworth, Lawrence nd Fort
Gibson Railroad, and this is the road built by the M., K. & T.
R. R. Co. under the act of 1866,. and under its contract with
the A., T. & S. F. R. R. Co. and the grants of the State of
Kansas.
Now, it is a strained construction of the act of 1866, in the
face of all the probabilities of the case; imputing to Congress,
in which that State had two .Senators and several members of
the House of Representatives, great carelessness, to hold that
they intended each one of these separate statutes to stand by
itself and the claims to be asserted under them to be distinct
grants for different railroads. It is much fore reasonable and
consonant to all we know of the transaction, and in consideration of the almost certainty that Congress had in view tho
single purpose of building one road down the Neosho Valley,
from Fort Riley to the point of intersection with the other
road, and that it was aware of the agreement between the
A., T. & S. F. R. R. Co. and its grantee in the act of 1866, to
hold that it intended by the later act to ratify and make
good the right which the U. P. R. R. Co., Southern Branch,

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

already had to the same lands for the purpose of building that
road.
The fact that the act of 1866, while in general terms granting these lands to the State of Kansas, declared tha- that
State should'hold them for the benefit of the U. P. R R. Co.,
Southern Branch, so far from militating against this view of
the subject, tends to confirm it. Intending to ratify, to make
good, and add'to the force of the title of that company, which
it hhd derived from its agreements with the A., T. & S. F. R. R.
Co., it did not leave it even in the power of the State of Kansas to confer these lands upon any other company than this
one, and thereby prevented all conflict of claims under these
several grants. This view of the subject was taken by Mr.
Browning, Secretary of the Interior, in a letter addressed to
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, March 25, 167,directing the withdrawal of the' lands along the line of the
road from public sale or preemption for the benefit of the U.
P. IR.R. -Co., Southern Branch, and it has been acted upon by
the Land Department and by the various Secretaries of the
Interior, from that day to this, as the true construction of the
statutes.
It'is true that when the-M., K. & T. R. R. Co. made its application for the lands now in controversy, as indemnity lands,
it asserted rights under the acts of 1863 and 1864 by virtue of
the assignment Qf the A., T. & S. F. IR.R. Co., and the ratification of that assignment by the State of Kansas, and also under
the act of 1866 directly to that company; and it is true that
the Secretary of the Interior, while acknowledging the claim
to have been made under all the acts, certified the lands to the
State of Kansas in accordance with the terms of the acts of
1863 and 1864, instead of issuing patents directly to the rail.
road company, as was provided for in the act of 1866. But
since that company had all the rights conferred by all three of
these statutes, and by the *ratification by the State of Kansas of
the transfer from the-A., T., & S. F. R. R. Co., and since that
State, after these lands.were certified to it for the benefit of
this company, issued to it patents of the State for those lands,
'it is obvious that the company thus acquired the real owner-

Opinion of the Couft.
ship and the equitable interest in the lands which it had earned
by building the road, in accordance with the provisions of all
the statutes and all the contracts made upon the subject. If
there be any informality in the attempt of the Secretary of
the Interior and of the State of Kansas to confer upon the railroad company the legal title to these lands, it is for the company to seek relief and -to have those informalities corrected,
not for the United States to set aside its solemn instruments in
which those rights are evidenced, and under which not only
the railroad company then interested, but its grantee, the
present appellant, holds these lands or has sold them to innocent purchasers. So far, then, as this objection goes, that one
of these acts of Congress nullifies the others, we think it to be
untenable.
Another objection strongly insisted upon arises out of the
language of the act of 1863. That act provided for two roads,
with branches to each. The first was a road from the city of
Leavenworth, by way of the town of Lawrence, to the southern
line of the State, in the direction of Galveston Bay, in Texas.
The second was a road from the city of Atchison, by way of
Topeka, to the western line of the State, in the direction of
Fort Union and Santa Fg,in New Mexico, with a branch from
where this last-named road crosses the Neosho River, down
the valley of that river to the point where the said first-named
road enters the said Neosho Valley. This branch down the
Neosho Valley is the road now under consideration, and the
grant of lands of 1863 is to the point on its line where the
first-named road, the Leavenworth, Lawrence & Fort Gibson,
enters the said Neosho Valley.
It is said that the road of the M., K. & T. R. R. Co., which
we have already held to represent the grant of Congress under
this statute, was not constructed to the point where the L., L
& F. G. R. R. entered the Neosho Valley, but that those two
roads joined at a point far within the entrance of the L., L. &
F. G. R. R. into the valley. The -distance is said to be about
eight or ten miles, and this is supposed.to defeat the right of
the company building this road to the lands on each side of it.
But we are of opinion that this is foo narrow a construction of

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.

Opinion of the Court.
the language describing the point at which the two roads mentioned'in the same statute were expected to meet and cross
each other. The construction thus asserted requires that the
exact point of the high ground on the north of the Neosho
River should be ascertained with great precision where the
railroad of the other company, coming from the north, enters
the valley. It seems to us, however, that the purpose of Congress was to make a grant of lands along the N~eosho Valley
to the company which should build it to the most appropriate
point, wherever that might be, in this narrow valley at which
the two roads might chance to come together; and that, as
the road has been built and the lands earned, and the officers
of the Federal Government having charge of the matter have
accepted this place of junction as the proper one to govern the
selection of lands for the company building the road, and since
neither of those roads make any objection to this decision, and
it is impossible to see how any substantial right of any person
can be injured by it, that it is the duty of the court to accept
the location of the road as a proper location, in accordance
with the action of the officers of the Land Department; and
that it is not a case for the Government of the United States to
interfere to set aside its own-action in the matter, under the
loose terms employed in the acts of Congress.
In support of this view of the subject it must appear to any
thinking mind that the grant of lands to the M., K. & T. R. R.
Co. would not be defeated if the other road from the north
did not build into the valley of the Neosho River at all; and
yet, if the strict and literal construction of the phrase, "where
that road enters the valley," should be adopted, that would be
the effect upon the grant. The purpose of Congress being to
have these roads cross within the narrow valley of the Neosho
River, and the grant of lands to the M., K. & T. R. R. Co.
terminate at the point where it came to a junction with the L.,
L. & F. G. R. R., the latter being continued on to the south,
we do not think this objection sufficient to justify a decree setting aside the action of the officers of the government.
It is to be observed that this objection is raised under the
language of the act of 1863, and that the act of 1866 contains

Opinion of the Court.

no such requirement as that with reference to the crossing of
the roads, it being declared in the latter act that the road is to
be built down the valley of the :Neosho River to the southern
line of the State. Of course, if the act of 1866 is, as we suppose, supplementary to the acts of 1863 and 1864, the description of the route of the road Vind its terminus in tbe later act
is the one which must govern the grant of lands.
Another objection urged to the ownership of the lands by
this company under the patents from the State of Kansas is,
that the company has received more lands than it was entitled
to under the grant. We do not think it necessary to enter into
the details of the evidence of how much land was granted, how
much was found in place, and how much the road was entitled
to as indemnity for lands not so found in place. In the first
place, we are not at all satisfied by the evidence in. the record
that the lands received are in excess of the various grants to
this company. In the next place, the issue is not made fairly
in the bill, and certainly no particular certificate nor any particular patent from the State of Kansas is pointed out as being
the one which contains the excess over the grant, and it is not
possible for the court, under any evidence or any pleading, to
ascertain which of these certificates and of these patents, or
what particular portions of them, should be held void and what
valid. United Statem v. Burlington & fMissouri River Railroad, 98 U. S. 334.
And lastly, while we are not disposed to hold the action of
the officers of the Land Department of the government as absolutely conclusive upon such a subject as this, we see no reason
why their deliberate action, with careful attention, and all the
means of ascertaining what was right, should be set aside in this
case. There are other grounds urged for granting the relief
sought by the bill, but they are not sufficient to justify such
a decree, nor are they important enough to require further discussion here.
The decree of the Circuit Court is 'ever8ed, and the caee remanded to it, with direction8 to dimiss the bill.
