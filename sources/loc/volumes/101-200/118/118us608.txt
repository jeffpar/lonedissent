NEW YORK ELEVATED RAILROAD v. FIFTIh
NATIONAL BANL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Submitted October 2, 156.-Decided November 1, 1886.

The value of the matter in dispute in -this court is determined by the amount
of the judgment below, without regard to the amount of the verdict.
Jurisdiction of a cause having once attached in this court, cannot be defeated
by plaintiff below waiving or releasing enough of the judgment to bring it
within the jurisdictional amount.

This was a motion to dismiss on the ground that the matter
in dispute did not exceed the sum or value of $5000. The
suit was brought by the Fifth National Bank of the City of
New York against the New York Elevated Railroad Company, to recover damages for injuries to real.estate. A.trial
was had, which resulted in a verdict against the raih'oad company, on the 9th of June, 1886, for 5000. At the time of the
rendition of the verdict the railroad company moved for a new
trial. This motion was denied on the 10th of August, and, on
the 26th of the same month, a judgment was entered for
$5068.33, that being the amount of the verdict, with interest
added to the date of the judgment. The claim now made was,
that the value of the- matter in dispute was to be determined
by the verdict, without the interest.

I. The subject-matter involved in this appeal, exclusive of

Opinion of the Court.

costs, is only $5000, and the Supreme Court is therefore, under
tlhe statute, without jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and the
WYalker v. United States, 4
.rit of error should be dismissed.

565; Railroad Co. v. Trook, 100 U. S., 112; MAerrill v. Petty,
16 Wall, 338; .ilton v. Dickinson, 108 U. S. 165.
II. The subject "matter in dispute" is the amount of the
verdict, and that being only $5000, no review by the Supreme
Court will lie. It can make no difference that interest has accru6d in the meantime, and been added in the judgment. The
"matter in dispute," the subject of grievance, is the verdict,
and not the interest, and jurisdiction depends on that; and
that being only $5000, exclusive of costs, the Supreme Court
obtains no jurisdiction. .knapp v. Banks, 2 How. 73; Malker
v. Unnited Stzte8, supra. And see Josuez v. Conner, 75 N. Y.
156.
III. Defendant in error has a right to waive or release any
part of the jqdgment, and, as it releases or waives the accrued
interest between the time of the rendition of the verdict and
the time of the entry of the judgment, the subject, or matter in
dispute, must necessarily only be $5000, exclusive of costs, and
consequently there is no jurisdiction to review. Defendant in
error waiving this interest, plaintiff in error cannot allege that
it is in dispute.

court.
The rule is settled that, when a writ of error is sued out
from this court by the defendant below, and no question is
presented growing out of a partial defence to the action, or a
counter-claim or a set-off, the value of the matter in dispute is
fixe4l by the amount of the judgment. Gordon v. Ogden, 3 Pet.
