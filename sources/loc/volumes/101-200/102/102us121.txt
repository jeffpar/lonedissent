jurisdiction.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Louisiana.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
*1

Mr J D _ouse and Mr William Grant for the appellant.
.r Charles B. Singleton, Jr., contra.
MR. CmIi' JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the

court.
From this record it appears affirmatively that the only dispute between the'parties is as to the right of the insurance
association to withhold a transfer of stock until an indebtedness of a stockholder to it for $2,074.86 is paid. Such being
the case, we have no jurisdiction of this appeal. In Gray v
Blanchard (97 U. S. 564) we held that a writ of error must
be dismissed when it appears from the record, taken as a whole,
that the amount actually in controversy between the parties
was not sufficient to give us jurisdiction.
Appeal dismzssed.

1. An appeal is the only mode by which the appellate jurisdiction of this court

and if does not lie before a final decree, has been rendered.
2. A proceeding in the court below for contempt cannot be re-examined here by
an appeal or a writ of error.

MOTION to dismiss a writ of error to the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Southern District of New York.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
