Neither do we see any error of which the United States can
complain in respect to the costs. Full costs were recovered up
to the time the debt was paid. This implies that after that
time each party must pay his own costs. It is clkar a plea of
payment puts darrzen was waived, because the parties, when
submitting the case, agreed on the fact of payment after the
suit was commenced, and in terms said that the only issue
between them was in respect to the commissions. This stipulation as to what the issue was is equivalent, for the purposes
of review here, to an admission of record that proper pleadings
had been filed to raise that issue.

[Sup. Ct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
On the 10th of March, 1852, the legislature of Mississippi passed an act to incorporate the Mississippi Central
Railroad Company
Sects. 17 and 18 of that act are as follows "SCT. 17. Be it further enacted, that the boards of police
of the several counties of Madison, Holmes, Carroll, Yallabusha,
Lafayette, and Marshall, together with such other counties as are
adjoining or adjacent to the counties through which said railroad
may pass, may for their respective counties subscribe for capital
stock in said railroad, not to exceed in amount two hundred thousand dollars for any one county- Provided,however, that an election shall be holden in the county for and on account of which said
stock is proposed to be subscribed, by the qualified electors thereof,
at the regular precincts of said county, ten days' notice of the time
of holding such election, and of the amount proposed to be subscribed, being first given by the board of police, and if at such
election a majority of the qualified electors voting shall be in favor
of such subscription, then said board shall make such subscription
for and in behalf of the county for the amount specified, but if a
majority of those voting shall be opposed to such subscription, the
same shall not be made.
"SECT. 18. Be it flirther enacted, that said several boards of
police, either before or after any election held as provided in the
seventeenth section of this act, may direct, that whenever any tax
shall be collected in their respective counties for the payment of
the capital'stock so subscribed by the county, which tax the several
boards of police are hereby authorized to assess and collect firom
the taxable property or real roperty of the county as said board
may elect, that the sheriff or tax-collector shall issue to the person
paying such tax a certificate specifying the amount of tax so paid,
and on account of what railroad the same is paid, which said certificate or certificates shall be transferable by indorsement, and whenever any person, either by payment of taxes as aforesaid, or by
indorsement as aforesaid, shall hold a certificate or certificates, in
amount equal to one or more shares of the capital stock of said
railroad company, be may present the same to the treasurer of said
company, who shall thereupon take up the said certificate or certificates and issue to the holder of them certificates for one or more
shares of stock in said company, and such holder of said certificate

of stock shall be for such stock substituted to the right of the
county as a stockholder to the number of shares named in said
certificate."
On the 19th of April, and during thu same session of the
legislature, a supplemental act was passed, by which, if the act
should be approved by a vote of the several counties through
which the road might be located, a tax of five percent on the
assessed value of all lands lying within five miles, and two and
one half per cent on all lying over five miles and under ten, of
the road, was to be collected annually for a term of four years
to aid in the construction of the road. Sect. 4 of this act is as
follows "S&CT. 4. Be it further enacted, that whenever any sheriff or
tax-collector shall collect any tax by virtue of this act, he shall give
to the person or persons paying the same a certificate therefor,
which certificate shall be transferable by indorsement, and whenever any person or persons, either by payment of taxes as aforesaid, or by indorsement as aforesaid, shall hold a certificate or
certificates in amount equal to a share of the capital stock of said
railroad company, he may present tlhe same to the treasurer of said
company, who shall thereupon take up the said certificate or certificates, and issue to the holder of them a certificate for a share of
stock in said company, which certificate shalf entitle such person to
all the rights and privileges of a stockholder in said railroad company."
On the 28d of November, 1859, the Memphis, Holly Springs,
and Mobile Railroad Company was incorporated. Sect. 7 of
that act of incorporation gave authority to the board of directors "to issue, sell, negotiate, mortgage, pledge, or hypothecate
the bonds or notes of the company, as well as any notes, bonds,
scrip, certificates, or other property for the payment of money,
or other property which said company shall or may, receive as
donations, or in payment of subscriptions to the capital scock
of said company, or other dues thereto." Sect. 8 provided that
the board of directors might require each subscriber, at the
time of subscribing, or at any time thereafter, to pay a part,
not exceeding ten per cent, of his subscription to the capital
stock in cash, and that no further payment should be demanded

WELLS V. SUPERVISORS.

[Sup. Ct.

until in the opinion of the board a sufficient amount of the
capital stock had been subscribed, with the means and credits
of the company, to construct the road. No calls were to be
made except on thirty days' notice, and the amount called for
at any one time could not exceed thirty per cent to each subscriber of the amount of his subscription. Sect. 15 is as follows "SECT. 15. Be it further enacted, that the sects. 17 and 18 of an
act passed by the legislature of this State, and approved March 10,
1852, entitled 'An Act to incorporate the Mississippi Central Railroad Company,' regulating county subscriptions to the capital stock
of said company, be, and the same are, adopted as part of this act,
so f r as the provisions of the same may be applicable."
By sect. 16 the company was authorized to consolidate with

other railroad companies.
No organization is shown to have been perfected under this
act, and, Feb. 20, 1867, another act was passed, of which the
title and the only portion pertinent to this case are as follows "An Act to revve and amend an Act entitled 'A-n Act to incorporate the iXemphis and Hfolly Sprtngs and 3fobile .Railroad
Company,' approved _Nov. 23, 1859, and for other -Purposes.
",SECT. 1. Be it enacted by the legislature of the State of Mississippi, that the above-recited act be, and the same is hereby,

revived, and that the style of said railroad company shall hereafter
be known as the IMemphis, Holly Springs, Okolona, and Selma
Railroad Company,' and, as many of the original incorporators
are now dead, that N. B. Forrest" [&c.] "all of the State of-Mississippi, together with those who may hereafter become stockholders,
their successors, &c., shall be said corporators.
"SECT. 2. Be it further enacted, that said company shall have
sixteen years in which to construct the said road, and shall commence the same in three years from and after the passage of this
act."
When these several acts were passed, the Constitution of
Mississippi, adopted in 1832, was in force. This constitution
contained no limitation on the power of the legislature to

Oct. 1880.]

authorize counties to become stockholders in, or to lend their
credit to, railway or other corporations. A new constitution
went into effect in 1868, art. 12, sect. 14, of which is as follows "The legislature shall not authorize any county, city, or town to
become a stockholder in, or lend its credit to, any company, associaton, or corporation, unless two-thirds of the qualified voters of
such county, city, or town, at a special election, or regular election, to be held therein, shall assent thereto."
At a special election held for that purpose on the 20th of
November, 1869, the people of the county voted a subscription
to the capital stock of the Memphis, Holly Springs, Okolona,
antd Selma company, and on the 21st of July, 1870, the name
of the company was changed by a special act of the legislature
to the Selma, Marion, and Memphis Railroad Company
On the 19th of April, 1872, a general act was passed " to
authorize counties, cities, and towns to subscribe to the capital
stock of railroads," which gave any county through which any
railroad should pass authority to subscribe any sum to the
capital stock, if two-thirds of the legal voters should give their
assent in the manner specially provided for. Such subscriptions were to be paid in the twenty-year coupon bonds of the
county, bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent per
annum. Taxes were to be levied and collected to pay the
principal and interest of these bonds as they matured, and it
was further also provided "that certificates of shares in the
capital stock of said companies shall be issued to all persons
paying taxes for the principal and interest of said bonds, to
the amount paid by them, whenever the receipts for the taxes
so paid shall be equal to one or more shares of the capital
stock."

Under date of July 1, 1872, the board of supervisors of
Pontotoc County, which was the legAl successor of the board
of police, under the authority of the vote of Nov 20, 1869,
issued to the Selma, Marion, and Memphis Railroad Company
coupon bonds having twenty years to run, and bearing interest,
payable semi-annually, at the rate of eight per cent per annum,
amounting in the aggregate to $150,000. The plaintiff being

WELLS v. SUPERVISORS.

[Sup. Ct.

the holder for value of a large amount of the coupons of these
bonds, payable January and July, 1873, and January, 1874,
which were not paid on presentation at maturity, brought this
suit for their recovery
The court below gave judgment
against him as on demurrer to the declaration, which presented
substantially the foregoing facts, and to reverse that judgment
this writ of error has been brought.
The controlling question in this case is whether there was
authority in law for issuing the bonds to which the coupons
sued on were attached. If there was not, it has always been
held that no recovery can be had in an action on the bonds or
coupons. It is also settled that unless the power to issue bonds
for the payment of municipal subscriptions to the stock of railroad companies is given in express terms, or by reasonable
implication, no obligation of that kind can be created.
In Mississippi, as a general rule, the boards of supervisors
of counties have no other financial powers than "to levy such
taxes as may be necessary to meet the demands of their re-

spective counties," and to " direct the appropriation of the
money that may come into the treasury " Code (1880), sects.
2148 and 2158, Code (1857), c. 59, sect. 4, arts. 16, 30.
This, it has been held by the highest court of the State, gives
no power to borrow money In Beam an v Leake County (42
liss. 247), decided in 1868, the court, referring to an act then
under consideration, passed in December, 1863, but which in
no manner affects this case, said, "The act just referred to is
the only one of a general nature empowering boards of police
to borrow money, and without some such act they could not
lawfully do so in their official characters." The policy of the
State from its earliest history seenis to have been to require
municipal organizations to meet their current liabilities by
current taxation, and in Hawkins v CarrollCounty (50 id. 762)
it was expressly declared that "the grant of power to such a body
of an extraordinary character, ,such as is not embraced in the
general scope of its duties, must be strictly construed."
Such being the general law of the State, we come to coisider the special legislation on which this case depends, that
is to say, sects. 17 and 18 of the act of 1852, in connection
with the other provisions of the act of 1859, into which these

Oct. 1880.]

WELLS V. SUPERVISORS.

sections were incorporated by adoption. Undoubtedly sect. 17
authorized a subscription to the"stock of the railroad company
for the county, after a majority of the electors of the county
had in the proper way given their consent, and it is possible, if
there had been nothing more, that, under the rule of construction stated in Lynde v. Mke County (16 Wall. 6), the .subscription might have been paid in bonds. It seems to us,
however, that the provisions of sect. 18 are such as to exclude
any such presumption. By that section the boards of police
(supervisors) were authorized to assess and collect a tax on
the taxable property or the real property of the county, at
their election, "for the payment of the capital stock so subscribed." No other mode of payment was provided for. This
of itself, when considered in the light of the settled policy of
the State to require the current liabilities of counties to be
discharged by current taxation, would seem to indicate an
intention not to confer upon the counties the power of funding
this kind of liability But when it is taken in connection with
the further provision of the same section, which authorizes the
boards of police to direct that the railroad company issue to
the tax-payers, in lieu of the county, stock to the amount of
their taxes paid, the intention is even more apparent. As
stock was to be issued by the company to an amount equal to
the taxes paid, it would seem as though it could not have been
supposed that before the tax was collected any payment of the
subscription was to be made, or any stock issued, that could in
any manner interfere with this privilege of the tax-payers.
So, too, the company could only be required to issue stock upon
and to the amount of the subscription. As the tax-payer was
to be entitled to stock to the full amount of his payment, it
follows that the tax must have been intended to pay the subscription, and not bonds. We are not unmindful of the fact
that the language of this part of the section is such as to leave
it optional with the board to give this direction or not, but it
may nevertheless be referred to, as we think, to strengthen the
presumption arising from the other provisions, that the subscription was not tQ be paid through taxation, directly or indirectly, until the money to be raised inthat way had actually
been collected. This statute conferred an extraordinary power

WELLS V. SUPERVISORS.

[Sup. Ct.

on the boards of police. It authorized them to create a new
liability for their respective counties, and provided a special
way of discharging that liability The liability and the mode
of discharge were provided for in the same statute. This being
so, the mode prescribed is exclusive of all others.
This case differs materially from Lynde v The County,
supra. There the tax voted was to be levied annually during
a period not exceeding ten years, and the amount for each
year definitely fixed. As this was done for the purpose of
building a court-house, the court very properly held the vote
implied permission to borrow money to accomplish the object
in anticipation of the collection of the tax, which must necessarily be delayed a considerable number of years. Here the tax
was to be levied to pay the subscription, that is to say, to pay
the company the amount subscribed when, by the terms of
the subscription, that obligation was to be met. As the
statute on its face contemplated no delay in raising the money
by taxation, no implication of a power to borrow in anticipation of the tax can arise. The subscription might be made,
but the money must be raised by taxation to meet it. The
railroad company cannot complain, for when it received the
subscription it knew, or ought to have known, from what
source the money was to come to meet the payment, and it
impliedly gave its consent to such delays as were necessarily
incident to the mode of collection. The other provisions of
the charter, as to calls on subscribers to meet their subscriptions, were not necessarily applicable to counties. Counties
were to pay as they agreed, and when the tax was collected.
It may be true, as is urged, that the collection of the full
amount of the subscription in a single year would be oppressive,
but it by no means follows that this must necessarily have been
done. These sections are to be construed in the act of 1859
precisely as they would be in that of 1852, except so far as
they may have been modified by the other provisions in 1859.
The original act of 1852 is to be considered in connection with
the supplemental act passed a little later. Being zn par
matena, and enacted at the same session of the legislature,
they are to be taken together as one law From the supplemental act it is apparent that the object of the legislature was

Oct. 1880.]

WELLS v. SUPERVISORS.

to raise money by taxation to aid in the construction of the
road, and to require the company to give the tax-payers stock
for the money they paid. This is entirely inconsistent with
any idea of the payment of interest. As the special tax on
adjoining lands was large, it was extended over a period of
years. This amount was fixed, and not left to the discretion
of any one. In respect to the country at large the plan
adopted was different. There it was left for the people to
determine for themselves how much the subscription should
be, and for the county and the company to agree when it
should be paid. In this way the tax might be extended over
a series of years, but as stock was to be issued by the company for all payments made, it could not have been intended
to tax beyond the actual amount of the subscription. Consequently, if time was given by the company to make the payment, it must be without interest.
This construction of the act is strengthened by what actually happened. The revived and amended charter was passed
in 1867, and the subscription voted in 1869. When the sub"scription was made does not appear, but certain it is that no
bonds were issued to make the payment until after the policy
of the State in respect to funding this class of liabilities was
changed by the act of 1872. Then, although confessedly that
act did not apply to this case and its provisions were not followed, the subscription was paid by binding the tax-payers
of the county to pay in the aggregate $390,000, instead of
$150,000, as was voted. This we think could not be done.
It is further argued that, because the seventh section of the
act of 1859 authorized the railroad company to sell any bonds
it might receive as donations or in payment of subscriptions,
the power of counties to issue bonds in payment of their subscriptions must be inferred. We cannot so understand that
provision. This gave power to sell bonds if in the course of
business they should get to be the property of the company,
but the implied prohibition against their issue by counties
still remains.
It is also said that the provision m sect. 18 for giving individual tax-payers stock for the amount of their taxes paid cannot be considered as in any manner precluding an implication

OGDEN V. COUNTY OF DAVIESS.

[Sill. Ct.

of the power to issue bonds, because the same provision is
found in sect. 4 of the act of 1872. There is this difference
between these provisions of the two acts
in that of 1852
the railroad company is to issue the stock to the tax-payer,
while that of 1872 simply says that certificates of shares shall

be issued, without saying by whom.

But it is not for us at

tins time to determine the legal effect of that part of the act
of 1872. Power to issue bonds is given in express terms by
that act, and stock was to be issued to all persons "paying
taxes for the principal and interest of said bonds," while in
the act of 1852 the tax was to be collected " for the payment
of the capital stock so subscribed," and stock was to be issued
by the company to the persons holding certificates of the paymenDt of this tax.
On the whole, we think the court below was right in holding that the issue of bonds in this case was not authorized by

law'

Different questions will arise if the railroad company,

or any one who has been subrogated to the rights of the company, shall attempt to enforce the payment of- the original

subscription by the county

Judgment affrmed.

OGDEN V. COUNTY OF DAViESS.
1 An act of the General Assembly of Missouri, approved Jan. 4, 1860, authorizes counties, towns, and cities to subscribe to the stock of a railroad company which it incorporated, and issue bonds in payment therefor. The
seventh section enacts that "upon the presentation of a petition of the
president and directors of said company to the county court of any county
through which said road may be located, praying that a vote may be
taken in any strip of country through which it may pass, not to exceed
ten miles on either side of said road that the inhabitants thereof are
desirous of taking stock in said road and of voting upon themselves a
tax for the payment of the same,-it shall be the duty of said county
court to order an election therein, and shall prescribe the time, place, and
manner of holding said election, and if a majority of the taxable inhabitants shall determine in favor of the tax, it shall be the duty of said court
to levy and collect from them a special tax, winch shall be kept separate
from all other funds and appropriated to no other purposes, and as fast
as collected shall cause the same to be paid to the treasurer of said com-
