GREENWOOD v. RANDALL.
Opinion of the Court

record. Nis pleadings were their pleadings, and the issues
which he had presented for trial were their issues. The
trustee did not see fit to take steps at that time for a removal;
neither did they. When the term ended, the term at which
the cause, as a cause, could be first tried had passed by, and all
right of removal under the act of March 3d, 1875, then in
force, was gone.
It is true that the creditors got leave to file pleadings within
ninety days, and that their answers and cross-bills were in
before that time expired, but this operated only as an amendment of the original pleadings and created no new right of removal. As was said in Babbitt v. Clark, 103 U. S. 612, "the
act of Congress does not provide for the removal of a cause at
the first term at which a trial can be had on the issues as
finally made up by leave of court or otherwise, but at the first
term at which the cause, as a cause, could be tried."
Without considering any of the other questions presented by
the record,
We reverse the decree, and remand the cause to the District
Court, with instructions to send the case back to the State
courtfrom which it was improperly removed.
