ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 261. Submitted December 18, 1899.-Decided January 22,1900.
The plaintiff in error executed and delivered to the defendant in error a
bond for $4900 (with a mortgage of real estate in Illinois to secure it),
payable "ii gold coin of the United States of America of the present
standard weight and fineness." Default being made, the defendant in
error brought suit to foreclose the mortgage, praying judgment according
to the bond and mortgage. The plaintiff in error demurred, alleging that
the matters and things set out in the bill were contrary to public policy
and void, because it was not lawful for the parties to make any money
but gold and silver a money tender in payment of the debt, and for other
reasons get forth in the statement of the case, below. This was overruled, and, as no further answer was made, the trial court held that the
debt and interest, etc., were due amounting to the sum of $5350.76 and
decreed that if the sum due was not paid within five days, the mortgaged real estate should be sold. This decree was sustained by the
Appellate Court, whose judgment was sustained by the Supreme Court
of the State. Held, that the state Circuit Court, having simply held
plaintiffs in error to respond in lawful money, and entered its decree
accordingly, and the Supreme Court having decided that plaintiffs in
error could not complain of that decree, because not prejudiced thereby,
this was not a decision against any right secured by the Constitution or
laws of the United States specially set up or claimed by plaintiffs in error
in those courts.

Statement of the Case.

against Robert Rae, Jr., and his wife for the foreclosure of a
certain mortgage or trust deed on real estate in that county,
given by them to secure a bond whereby Rae acknowledged
that he was bound to the company "in the sum of ninetyeight hundred dollars ($9800.00) in gold coin of the U nited
States of America, of the present standard weight and fineness," and which recited that the company had advanced to him "the principal sum of forty-nine hundred dollars (84900),
which said sum, together with interest thereon, costs, charges •
and expenses, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of
seventy-eight hundred sixty-seven dollars and twenty cents
($7867.20) is to be repaid within ten years from date in gold
coifn as aforesaid, in monthly instalments of sixty-five dollars
and fifty-six cents ($65.56) each, payable on the first day of each
"
calendar month during the said term of ten years.
The bill alleged default in the payment of certain monthly
instalments, and that, in pursuance of the terms of the bond
and trust deed, the company had declared the entire amount
of the loan due and payable, and prayed "that upon the hearing hereof the court will ascertain upon an accounting how
much id due to the complainant under the terms of said bond
and trust deed, and will decree the payment of any amount so
found due, by a short day, in gold coin of the United States
of the present standard weight and fineness;" and for sale and
foreclosure, if the amounts decreed were not paid.
Defendants demurred to the bill, and set forth the following
causes of demurrer:
"(1) The matters and things set out in the complainants' bill
are contrary to public policy and void. (2) Because it is not
lawful for the complainants and the defendants to make any
money but gold and silver money a money tender in payment
of any debt contracted in the United States to. be paid in th6
United States. (3) That so much of the act of Congress of
February 28, 1878, entitled 'An act to authorize the coinage
of the standard silver dollar, and to restore its legal tender
character,' which provides that gold and silver money of the
United States shall be a legal tender for payment and discharge of debts and obligations is valid, but the proviso per-

mitting parties to make such special contracts as they please
as to the payment of debts and obligations in money other
than gold and silver is void. (4) That the contract or mortgage set forth in said bill and the relief prayed therein is void,
as against public policy. (5) That by virtue- of article I, section 8, paragraph 5, of the Constitution of the United States,
Congress alone has ' power to coin money and regulate the
value thereof,' and that by article I, section 10, paragraph 1,
of said Constitution it is pfovided .that 'ho State shall coin
money, emit bills of credit, or make anyt.hing bat gold and
silver coin a tender' in payment of debtsf in contracts made in
the United States to be performed in the United States. Said
defendants claim, jointly and severally, the benefits of said constitutional provisions. (6) That said bill should be dismissed
for want of equity."
The demurrer was overruled, defendants excepted, elected
to abide by it, and refused to answer over.- The bill was thereupon taken as confessed, and the Circuit Court on the evidence
entered a decree of foreclosure, finding that the defendant
Rae, Jr., "being indebted to the complainant in the 'sum of
$4900 for a loan made by the complainant to said defendant,
executed and delivered to the complainant his bond, bearing
date the 1st day of August, 1895, which bond is correctly set
out at length in complainant's bill ;" that to secure the bond
.id trust deed was duly given and recorded, and was a valid
and first lien on the premises therein described; that default
had been made in the payment of instalments as alleged, and
that the whole amount had been declared due; and that there
was due from defendant to complainant, for principal and
accrued interest, the sum of $5350.76, together with some
other items; and decreed that if the sums due were not
paid within five days the real estate mortgaged should be
sold in satisfaction.
* Defendants appealed to the Appellate Court of the State
of
Illinois" for the First District, and assigned for error the action
of the Circuit Court in overruling the demurrer, etc., and in
not dismissing the bill because it claimed there was due the
sum found to be due in gold coin of the United States of the

present standard in weight and fineness. The decree was
affirmed by the Appellate Court. Rae v. ffomestea? Loan c
Guaranty Company, 76 Ill. App. 548.
From that decree, defendants appealed to the Supremie
Court of Illinois, by which it was affirmed. Rae v. Guaranty
Loan & Trust CJompany, 178 Illinois, 369, 371. The opinion
of the Supreme Court was as follows: "The elaborate and
able argument for appellants cannot be considered on what
appears from this record, as the' decree does not find or require judgment in any particular kind of money, but finds a
sum due in dollars and cents. Even if it-were assumed that
contracts of this character could not be sustained, still, by the
final decree the appellants are not prejudiced, -they cannot
be heard to complain in an appellate tribunal. If the character of money in which payment is contracted to be made be
rejected from the contract, still the liability for payment in
some kind of legal tender would exist, hence by the decree no
prejudice resulted to appellants in overruling their demurrer."
The present writ of error was then brought and defendants
in error moved to dismiss or affirm.

FuLLER, after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
The Circuit Court of Cook County did not find the sums
due as due, nor decree their payment, in gold coin of the
United States. The record does not show that when the
instalments matured any demand was made for their payment
in gold, nor that a tender of money other than gold was made,
or, if made, that such tender would not have been accepted.
The presumptions are entirely to the contrary. The Circuit
Court decreed that the liability be discharged in any lawful
money of the United States, and the Supreme Court held that

defendants below could not be heard to complain of a decree
by which they were not prejudiced. This was a ground broad
enough to sustain the judgment without reference to any Federal question supposed to be involved.
According to the terms of section '709 of the Revised Stat,utes, we exercise jurisdiction over the final judgments and
decrees of state courts,, where the validity of a treaty or statute of, or authority exercised under, the United States, is drawn
in question and the decision is against their validity; or where
the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under,
any State, is drawn in question on the ground of repugnancy
to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and
the decision is in favor of their validity; or where any title,
right, privilege or immunity is claimed under the Constitution,
or any treaty or statute of-or commission held, or authority
exercised under, the United States, and the decision is. against
the title, right, privilege or immunity specially set up or
claimed by either party, under such Constitution, treaty,
statute, commission or authority.
The decision of the -Supreme Court of Illinois was not
against the validity of a treaty or statute of, or auth6rity
exercised under, th6 United States; nor was it in favor of the
validity of any statute of, or authority exercised under, the
.State of Illinois, asserted to'be repugnant to the Constitution
or laws of the United States; nor was it agaipst any title,
right, privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed by
plaintiffs in error.
The validity of part of the act of Congress of February 28,
1878, c. 20, 20 Stat. 25, was questioned, but plaintiffs in error
cannot bring the case here on the objection that that contention was not sustained.
The benefit of clause five, section eight, of article one, of
the Constitution, empowering Congress to coin money and
regulate the value thereof, and of clause one, section ten, of
article one, providing that no State shall coin money, emit
bills of credit, or make anything but gold and silver coin a
tender for the payment of debts, was claimed; but the state
courts did not deny to Congress any power granted, nor assert

in respect of the State any power prohibited, and it did not
appear that plaintiffs in error were deprived of any benefit
secured by either of those provisions.
Plaintiffs in error pointed out no provision of the Constitution, or of any law of the United States, forbidding the making of contracts payable in gold coin of the United States,
but contended that contracts so made payable were void
because opposed to public policy. The state Circuit Court,
however, simply held plaintiffs in error to respond in lawful
money, and entered its decree accordingly, and the Supreme
Court decided that plaintiffs in error could not complain of
that decree, because not prejudiced thereby. This was not a
decision against any right secured by the Constitution or laws

LINDSAY AND PHELPS COMPANY v. MULLEN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES- FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.
No. 44. Argued April 6, 1, 1899. -Decided January 15,1900.
The provision in § 2400 of the statutes of Minnesota of 1894, requiring each
surveyor general to survey all logs and timbers running out of any boom
now chartered or which may hereafter be chartered by law in his district, refers to corporations organized under a general law, as well as to
those whose organization is provided for by special act.
The business of booming logs on the waters of streams running through
the forests of the West is a lawful business, add the Minnesota Boom
Company was a lawfully organized corporation for the purpose of doing
such lawful business.
The statute of Minnesota requiring all logs running out of a .boom to be
surveyed, inspected and scaled is compulsory, and such legislation was
within the power of the State.
The scale bills in this case were certified as required by the laws of the
State, and, being so certified, were competent evidence; and, when taken
in connection with other evidence, supported the affding of the court
that the work was done as alleged.
A record in the books of the surveyor general is not preliminary to a right
to a lien for such work.
