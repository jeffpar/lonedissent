Opinion of the Court.

MORAN v. DILLINGHAM.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT "COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 248. Submitted April 17, 1899.-Decided May 1, 1899.

The provision of the act of 1891, c. 517, ยง 3, that no judge before whom
"a cause or question may have been heard or tried" in a District or Circuit Court shall sit "on the trial or hearing of such cause or question"
in the Circuit Court of Appeals, disqualifies a judge, who has once
heard a cause upon its merits in the Circuit Court, from sitting in the
Circuit Court of Appeals on the hearing and decision of any question, in
the same cause, which involves in any degree matter on which he.had
occasion to pass in the Circuit Court.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.

M/R. JUSTICE

GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of certiorari heretofore granted by this court,
under the act of March 3,1891, c. 517, ยง 6, to review a de-'
cree made by Judge Pardee and J'udge Newman in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upon an appeal to
that court from the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of Texas.
The leading question presented by the writ of certiorari is
whether Judge Pardee was disqualified to sit at the hearing
of that appeal by the provision of ยง .3 of that act, "that no
justice or judge before whom a. cause or.question may have
been tried or heard in a District Court or existing Circuit
Court, shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals." 26 Stat. 827.
If Judge Pardee- was so disqualified, the decree in which he
took part, even if not absolutely void, must certainly be set
aside and quashed, without regard to its merits. .American

Co. v. Jacksonville Railway, 148 U. S. 372,

387.

The material facts bearing upon the question of his disqualification, as appearing by the record now before this
court, are as follows:
Upon a bill in equity, filed April 2, 1885, in the aforesaid
Circuit Court of the United States, by the Morgan's Louisiana
and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company against the
Texas Central Railway Company, to foreclose a mortgage
of its railroad and other property, Judge Pardee, on April 4,
1885, made an order, appointing Benjamin G. Clark and
Charles Dillingham joint receivers of the property, and appointing John G. Winter special master as to all matters
referred or to be referred to him in the cause.
Upon a petition filed in that cause by Dillingham, representing that he had been the active receiver for seventeen
months, and praying for an allowance for his services as such,
Judge Pardee, on December 4, 1886, made an order "that the
receivers be authorized and directed to place Charles Dillingham upon the pay roll of the receivers for the sum of one
hundred and fifty dollars per month, as an allowance upon his
compensation as receiver in this cause; this allowance to *date
from the possession of the receivers, and to continue while
Mr. Dillingham gives his personal attention to the business of
the company or until the further order of the court."
On April 12, 1887, Judge Pardee made a final decree in
the cause, for the foreclosure of the mortgage; for the sale
of the mortgaged property by auction; and for the payment
by the purchasers of "all the indebtedness of the receivers incurred by them in this cause, including all the expenses and costs
of the receivers' administration of the property," "and also the
compensation of the receivers and their solicitors;" appointing Dillingham and Winter special master commissioners to
make the sale, and to execute and deliver a deed to the purchasers; and reserving the right to any party to the cause, as
well as to the receivers and master commissioners, to apply to
the court for orders necessary to carry that decree into execution. Appeals from that decree were taken by the Morgan's

Opinion of the Court

Louisiana and Texas Railway and Steamship Company and
by the Texas Central Railway Company to this court, which
on November 21, 1890, affirmed that decree. 137 U. S. 171.
Pursuant to that decree, on April 22, 1891, all the property
mortgaged, except some not immediately connected with the
railroad, was sold to Mforan, Gold and McHarg, trustees for
bondholders. On their petition filed in the cause, Judge
Pardee, on August 28, 1891, made a decree directing Dillingham and Clark, receivers, to execute and deliver a deed, and
to deliver possession, to the purchasers, of all the property,
real and personal, of the Texas Central Railway Company, in
the State of Texas, used for and pertaining to the operation
of its railway; and providing "that nothing in this decree
contained is intended to affect, or shall be construed as affecting, the status of any pending or undetermined litigation in
which said receivers appear as parties; uch litigation shall
continue to determination in the name of said receivers, with
the right reserved to said purchasers, should they be so
advised, to appear and join in any such litigation; and nothing in this decree contained is intended to affect, or shall be
construed as affecting, the receivership of any of the property
of the defendant railway company other than the property so
transferred to said purchasers, possession of which said property other than that so transferred is retained for further administration, subject to the orders of this court;" and "that
said purchasers or said receivers may apply at the foot of this
decree for such other and further relief as may be just." The
property was accordingly delivered to the purchaser&in September, 1891. On November 6, 1891, on like petition of the
purchasers, Judge Pardee made a similar decree, except in
directing the deed to the purchasers to be executed and delivered by Dillingham and Winter, special master commissioners, and in other particulars not material to be mentioned.
Dillingham afterwards, and until April, 1895, continued to
draw and pay to himself the sum of $150 a month, and returned quarterly accounts to the master crediting himself
with those sums. On August 25, 1891, he presented a petition, entitled in the cause, to the master, praying him to

Opinion of the Court.

"make to him such an allowance for his services as receiver
in the above entitled cause, from the date of his appointment
until his discharge, as to said master may seem just and
proper." About the same time, a compromise was made
between him and the purchasers, pursuant .to which he was
paid, in addition to the allowance of $150 a month for the
past, the sum of $20,000 for services as receiver; and he
signed a paper, entitled in the cause, acknowledging that he
had received from them the sum of $20,000 "in full of my
fees and charges as receiver of the Texas Central Railway
Company, as per agreement." At the hearings before the
master upon Dillingham's accounts, it was contested between
him and the purchasers whether he was entitled to $150
monthly since the compromise. The master reported that he
was; and exceptions by the purchasers to his report were
referred on April 8, 1895, by order of Judge McCormick, to
Abner S. Lathrop, as special master, who, by his report, filed
September 26, 1896, found that Dillingham was entitled to
the monthly allowance of $150 until April, 1893, but was not
entitled to it from April, 1893, to April, 1895. That report,
on exceptions taken by the purchasers and by Dillingham,
was confirmed by decree of Judge Swayne on December 5,
1896; and from that decree Dillingham took an appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
All the proceedings above stated were filed in and entitled
of the cause of !organ's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and
Steamshp Company v. Texas Central Railway Company.
The hppeal of Dillingham was heard in the Circuit Court of
Appeals by Judge Pardee and Judge Newman, who, for reasons stated in their opinion, delivered by Judge Newman,
sustained Dillingham's exceptions to the master's report,
reversed the decree of Judge Swayne, and remanded the
cause to the Circuit Court "with instructions to overrule and
discharge the inotions attacking the receiver's accounts." 52
U. S. App. 425, 432. Moran, Gold and McHarg, the purchasing trustees, thereupon applied for and obtained this writ of
certiorari. 169 U. S. 737.

whom "a cause or question may have been tried or heard," in
a District or Circuit Court, "shall sit on the trial or hearing.
of such cause or question," in the Circuit Court of Appeals,
manifestly was to require that court to be constituted of judges
uncommitted and uninfluenced by having expressed or formed
an opinion in the court of the first instance. Whatever may be
thought of the policy of this enactment, it is not for the judiciary to disregard or to fritter away the positive prohibition of
the legislature.
The enactment, alike by its language and by its purpose, is
not restricted to the case of a judge's sitting on a direct appeal
from his own decree upon a whole cause, or upon a single
question. A judge who has sat at the hearing below of a
whole cause at any staga thereof is undoubtedly disqualified
to sit in the Circuit Court of Appeals at the hearing of the
whole cause at the same or at any, later stage. And,-as "a
cause'" in its usual and natural meaning, includes all questions
that have arisen or may arise in it, there is strong reason for
holding that a judge who has once heard the cause, eitker
upon the law or upon the facts, in the court of first instance,
is thenceforth disqualified to take part, in the Circuit Court of
Appeals, at the hearing and decision of the cause or of any
question arising therein. But, however that may be, a judge
who has once heard the cause upon its merits in the court of
first instance is certainly disqualified-from sitting in the Circuit
Court of Appeals on the hearing and decision of any question,
in the same cause, which involves in any degree matter upon
which he had occasion to pass in the lower court.
In the present case, all the decrees and orders of Judge
Pardee in the Circuit Court, as well as the decree of Judge
Swayne from which the appeal in question was taken, were
made in a-nd entitled of the original 'cause of the bill in equity
to foreclose the mortgage of the Texas Central Railway Company. The order appointing Dillingham and Clark receivers
upon the filing of the bill, the order allowing Dillingham
for his services as receiver the sum of $150 a month from his'
taking possession and "while he gives his personal attention to
the business of the company or until the further order of the

court," the final decree of foreclosure and sale, and the decrees
for delivery of possession to the purchasers, were all made by
Judge Pardee; and the appeal, in the hearing and decision of
which he took part, from the decree of another judge concerning the compensation of Dillingham as receiver, involved a
consideration of the scope and effect of his own order allowing that receiver a certain sum monthly.
The necessary conclusion is that Judge Pardee was incompetent to sit on the appeal in question, and the decree in which
he participated was not made by a court constituted as required
by law; and therefore thiis court, without considering whether
that decree was or was not erroneous in other respects, orders
the
Decree of the Circuit Court of Apeals to be set aside and
quashed, and the case remanded to that court to be there
heard and determined according to law by a bench of com-

petent judges.

OF

THE COUNTY

OF RNG5S

STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 248. Argued April 19, 1599. -Decided

May 1, 19.

If the petition of a woman, claiming to be the widow of a man supposed
to have died intestate, for the revocation of letters of administration
previously granted to his next of kin, and for the grant of such letters
to her, is dismissed by the surrogate's court upon the ground that a decree of divorce obtained by her in another State from a former husband
Is void; and she appeals from the judgment of dismissal to the highest
court of the State, which affirms that judgment; and, pending a writ
of error from this court, it is shown that a will of the deceased was
proved in the surrogate's court after its judgment dismissingher petition, and before her appeal from that judgment; the writ of error must
be dismissed.

THE statement of the case is in the opinion of the court.
