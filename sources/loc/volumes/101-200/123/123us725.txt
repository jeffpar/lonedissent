'RADFORD v. FOLSOI.
Opinion of the Court.

RADFORD v. FOLSOM.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.

FOR

Submitted December 8, 1837.-Decided December 19, 1887.

An appeal allowed in open court is of the date of Its allowance, and to be
kept in force should reach this court before the end of the term to which
it is made' returnable.
An appeal being allowed in open court, leaving the amount of the appeal
bond to be settled afterwards, the acceptance of a bond by the District
Judge after the expiration of the term at which the decree was rendered,
and without issue and service of citation, does not operate as a new
appeal as of the date of the acceltance of the bond.
The appearance of an appellee by counsel, without citation, at a term after
the term at which the appeal is returnable, and a motion to dismiss the
appeal for want of filing the transcript of the record during the return
term, do not waive the citation.

delivered the opinion of the

court.
This suit was brought to foreclose a mortgage given to
secure several alleged debts. On the 2d of April, 1884, the
bill was dismissed on its merits as to the principal one of the
debts and some others, but as to the rest, and as to matters
contained in a cross-bill of the .defendants, the cause was
referred to a master to find certain facts and state certain
accounts. The complainant on the same day prayed an appeal to this court, which was allowed, but never docketed
here.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

On the 10th of October, 1885, the court, after overruling
certain exceptions to the master's report, entered a second and
last decree, which was against the complainant, for $14,)84.77.
At the end of that decree was the following:
"And the complainant prays an appeal from the foregoing
decree, which appeal is by the court hereby allowed, and the
penalty of the appeal bond, if the same is to operate as a
dollars, but if the same is not to
supersedeas, is fixed at
operate as a supersedeas, then the penalty of the appeal bond
dollars."
is fixed at
The next term of this court thereafter began October 12,
1885, and the appeal was not docketed here during that term.
On the 8th of February, 1886, there was filed in the office
of the clerk of the Circuit Court, an order made by the District Judge at his chambers, and after the term at which the
decree was rendered, fixing the amount of the appeal bond at
$20,000 if for supersedeas, and at $2000 if for costs only. On
the 8th of March the complainant filed a motion; to modify
the amount of the appeal bond. On the 8th of June, while
this motion was pending, the complainant filed with the clerk
of the Circuit Court an appeal bond dated March 1, 1886, in
the penal sum of $25,000, which had been approved by the
District Judge as a supersedeas bond. On the 2d of October
the motion to modify the amount of the appeal bond was
overruled by the court, "on the ground that the case was
then in the Supreme Court of the United States." The case
was docketed in this court October 15, 1886. It does not
appear that any citation has ever been signed or served.
This motion was made on the 8th of December, 1887, during
the present term, to dismiss the case, "because each of said
appeals became null and void when the return term of this
court passed without a transcript of the record being filed in
this court and being docketed herein."
The first appeal taken in open court on the 2d of April,
1884, became inoperative by .reason of the failure to docket
the same in this court before the end of October Term, 1884.
Whether the decree from which, that appeal was taken was a
final decree, or interlocutory only, it is unnecessary now to

Syllabus.

consider. The appeal allowed in open court October 10, 1885,
also became inoperative as it was not docketed here before
the end of October Term, 1885, and this too whether the
bond approved by the District Judge after the term was
accepted to perfect that appeal or not. If an appeal at all,
it was of the date of its allowance in open court, and to be
kept in force it should have reached here before the end of
the term to which it was made returnable. Grisbyv. Purcell,

The acceptance of the bond by the District Judge cannot
be considered as the allowance of a new appeal at that date,
because that was after the term at which the decree was rendered and no citation was ever issued or served. Hfewitt v.
Filbert,116 U. S. 142. The appearance of counsel for appellee
at the present term on the making of this motion is not a
waiver of the citation. It would have been different if there
had been a general appearance at the last term, that being the
term to which the appeal if it had been properly taken would
have been returnable. United States v. Armejo, decided April
