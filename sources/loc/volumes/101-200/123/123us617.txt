some other person than the grantee; that no formal words are

necessary to create such an estate; and that, whenever a manifest intention is exhibited that another person shall have the
benefit of the property, the grantee shall be declared a trustee.
Section 2632 provides that every voluntary deed shall be void
as against subsequent bona fide purchasers for value without
notice of such voluntary conveyance. It follqws, from these
provisions, that as the deed in this case was recorded in due
time, it was valid as against the defendant, who had notice of
it before the mortgage to him of Mlay, 1870, was executed, and
before the sheriff's sale in 1876. This result is in accordance
with the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia. Gordon.

Mu. CHIEF JusTIcE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.
A judgment was rendered September 28, 1885, by the District Court of Arizona, in and formthe county of Pima, against
L. Zeckendoif & Co., the appellants, and in favor of Johnson,
the appellee, for $4304.93, "with interest on $2800-of said
sum, aJt the rate of two per cent per month from the date
hereof until paid, and interest on $1504.33, at the rate of ten
per cent per annum from the date hereof until paid." This
judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory,
on appeal, November 8, 1886. From that judgment of affirmance this appeal was taken, which the appellee moves to dis,"miss, on the ground that the value of the matter in dispute
does not exceed $5000, as now required by law. Act of -March
3, 1885, c. 355, 23 Stat. 443.
The value of the matter in dispute is to be determined by
the amount due at the time of the judgment brought here for
review, to wit, the judgment of the Supreme Court of the
Territpry, and not at the time of the judgment of the District Court. Adding the interest to the judgment of the
District Court until the date of that of the Supreme Court,
as we must for the purpose of determining our jurisdiction,
The Patapsco,12 Wall. 451 ; N. Y. Elevated Pailroadv. Fifth
N7 ational Bank, 118 U. S. 608, we find that. the amount due
at the time of the judgment of the Supreme Court was considerably more than $5000. The motion to dismiss is, therefore, denied.
But, on looking into the record, we discover that the errors
assigned relate only to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings. -These we cannot consider. The findings
of fact by the court below are conclusive, and cannot be reexamined here. The Abbotsfo'rd, 98 U. S. 440, and cases there
cited. Upon the facts as found there can be no doubt of the
correctness of the judgment. It is apparent if the case is kept
here longer it will be for delay only. For that reason the
motion to affirm is granted.
