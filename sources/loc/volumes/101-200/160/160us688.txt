the boundary line between it and the State of Iowa, which
are reported in 6 How. 659, and 10 How. 1, it -was further
said:
"Complainant states that it is highly important to the
States of Iowa and Missouri that the - question of boundary
should be speedily and finally settled; that heretofore the
peace of the people of the States of Missouri and Iowa, especially in the county of Mercer, in the former, and the county
of Decatur, in the latter, have been seriously disturbed in consequence of frequent conflicts of jurisdiction arising from differences of opinion as to the location of the said state line
between said counties.
"Complainant further states that the State of Missouri has
no adequate relief at law, and, as the controversy herein involves questions of jurisdiction and sovereignty, it is respectfully prayed that the State of Iowa may be made a defendant
in this proceeding, and that she may be permitted to answer
the matters and things herein set forth, and upon a final, hearing that the northern boundary line of the State of Missouri, it
being the boundary line between the complainant and defendant, be by the order and decree of this court ascertained and
established; that the rights of possession, jurisdiction, and
sovereignty of the State of Missouri to all the territory south of
the line heretofore marked and run out by said J. C. Sullivan

of Missouri, and that'said State of Missouri be quieted in her
title thereto, and that the defendant, The State of Iowa, be
forever enjoined and restrained from disturbing the said State
of Missofiri, her officers and her citizens, in the full enjoyment
and possession of the territory lying south of said line, and
that such other and further relief may b6 granted as the nature
of the case may require."
The State of Iowa; by its Attorney General, filed its answer, *denying some of the allegations in the bill, admitting
others, making further averments on its own part, and coitcluding:
"Said respondent, with the view to have.an ultimate and final
decision of the controversy, prays that this answer may also
be treated as a cross-bill, and joins in the prayer of said complainant that the said boundary line between said complainant
and respondent be, by the order and decree of-this court, ascertained and established, and to that end that a commission be
appointed, in such manner as to this court shall be deemed
proper, to retrace the line traced and marked by the commission of this court in 1850, and as set ,forth in the decree of this

be by such commissioners marked with fixed and enduring
monuments, and that the title of the State of Iowa in and to
dl iind or territory north of the line thus found -and marked
be forever quieted in the said respondent, and for such other
and further relief as equity and good conscience may require."
To this answer the State of Missouri filed replication as
follows:
"Complainant, for its reply to respondent's answer herein,
states that it is true, as heretofore alleged in complainant's
petition heretofore filed in this cause, that the officers of the
State of Iowa are exercising jurisdiction over territory lying
south of the boundary line between the States of Missouri and
Iowa.

Opinion of the Court.

"Complainant, for further reply to respondent's answer
herein, states that it is necessary, in order that conflicts of
jurisdiction should be avoided between said States, that the
true boundary line, as heretofore established under a decree
of this court by Hendershott and Minor, in 1850, should be
reestablished and relocated, and to this end it is asked that
the court may enter a decree relocating and reestablishing
said line, and that such other and further orders may be made
herein as are necessary to effect the same."
The parties further stipulated, each by its Attorney General,
as follows:
"It is hereby agreed that the above entitled cause may be
submitted to the court on the petition, answer, and reply of the
parties hereto, and if to the court it seems proper that a commission of two civil engineers or surveyors may be appointed to
retrace the line established and decreed by the Supreme Cou'rt
of the United States in the case of The State qf fissouri v. The,
State of Iowa, one of such commissioners to be appointed by
the State of Missouri and one by the State of Iowa, and if the
parties are unable to agree that they may appoint a third, that
such commission shall proceed without unnecessary delay and
retrace the line as run and located by IHendershott and Minor
in 1850 between the 50th and 55th mile-posts on said line,
beginning and ending the survey at such points as may be
necessary to ascertain the true original line between said mileposts, and, having found said true line, to mark the same by
plain and enduring monuments and make report of their said
retracing and survey of said line to this court."
