ALLISON v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE

moRrr
CooURT oF THE UNITED STATES FOR TH.
WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 698. Submitted November 20, 1895. -Decided December 16, 1.895.
When a person indicted for the commission of murder, offers himself at
the trial as a witness on his own behalf under the provisions of the act
of March 16, 1879, c, 37, 20 Stat. 30, the policy of that enactment should
not be defeated by hostile intimations of the trial judge. Hicks v. Uited
States, 150 U. S. 442, affirmed.
The defendant in this case having offered himself as a witness in his own
behalf, and having testified to circumstances which tended to show that
the killing was, done in self-defence, the court charged the jury: "You
must have something more tangible, more real, more certain, than that
which is a simple declaration of the party who slays, made in your presence by him as a witness, when he is confronted with a charge of murder.
All men would say that." Held, that this was reversible error.
Other statements made by-the court to the jury are held to seriously trench
on that untramhelled determination of the facts by'a jury to which parties accused of the commission of crime are entitled.
What is or what is not an overt demonstration of violence sufficient to
justify a resistance which ends in the death of the party making the
demonstration varies with the circumstances; and it is for the jury, and
not for the judge, passing upon the weight and effect of the evidence, to
determine whether the circumstances justified instant action, because of
reasonable apprehension of danger.

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Statement of the Case.
Where the charge of the trial judge takes the form of animated argument,
the liability is great that the propositions of law may become interrupted
by digressioB, and be so intermingled with inferences springing from
forensic ardor, that the jury will be left without proper instructions,
their province of dealing with the facts invaded, and errors intervene.

JoHw ALLisoN, some twenty years old, was indicted for the
murder of his father, William Allison, on the fifth day of
January, 1895, at the Cherokee Nation in the Indian country,
in the Western District of Arkansas, found guilty by a jury,
under the instructions of the court, and sentenced to be hanged,
whereupon he sued out this writ of error.
The evidence tended to show that the Allisons resided up to
the year 1893 in the State of Washington; that the parents
had been divorced; that the father had repeatedly threatened
the lives of the members of his family, and for an assault upon
one of his sons and his son-in-law, by shooting at.them with a
pistol, had been sent to the penitentiary for a year; and that
thereupon the family left the State of Washington and came
to the Indian country. In about a year the father appeared,
first at Hot Springs, Arkansas, where one daughter had located,
and then in the neighborhood of the other members of the
family in the Indian country; and at once began threatening
the lives of the entire family, and particularly that of his son
,John. A great variety of vindictive threats by the deceased
in Washington, at Hot Springs, and in the Indian country
was testified to.
Evidence was also adduced that on one occasion he came to
the house where the mother and her children were living and
demanded to see the children, who (except John and one whom
he had seen) were -not at home, and he then wished to see their
mother, who objected to meeting him; that he persisted,
-whereupon his son John, who had a gun in his hand, told him
he must leave, and the father dared John to come out and he
wojald fight him outside, but John answered that he did not
want any trouble with him- only wanted him to stay away
from there, and the deceased replied: "God damn you, I will
go off and get a gun and kill the last damned one of you;"
that.h1 subsequently told his son-in-law to tell John Allison

ALLISOIN v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

"that he would blow his God damned brains out the first
time he seen him; told him to tell him he would kill his
mother and the entire family ;" that the day after this occurrence John Allisoh and his mother made an affidavit to get a
peace warrant for William Allison, and on, that occasion John
told the prosecuting attorney that the old man threatened his
life, and he thought he was in danger, and asked him if he
killed the old man what would be done with him,. and he
replied that "if the old man came to his house and raised a
racket and tried to carry out his threats that he told me he
had made on him,. I told him he would be justified in doing it,"
but that he must not go "hunting the old man up and trying
to kill him," andthat John said, "I will not bother him; if he
will let me alone, I will let him alone;" and that this was
five or six days before the killing. The 'vidence further
tended to show that the deceased had been in the habit of
carrying a pistol; that he stated that he had one; that on
lNew Year's day he threatened' one of the witnesses with that
weapon,, and another witness testifiel to catching a glimpse
of it once when he. put his hand around to his hip pocket;
but that he had no pistol on him wh en- he waa killed. The
deceased was staying at the house of one Farris, and a witness testified in rebuttal to conversing with John when he
was ''warming'' on one occasion at the barn - presumably
Farns' barn.- and asking him why he did not go up to the
house, and he said he did not want -to go up there; that he
was afraid he and his father would have some trouble; that
he was afraid his father would hurt him; and that he was
going to kill him just as quick as he caught him away from
the house.
As to the circumstances immediately surrounding the honficide, the defendant testified that he and a man by the name
of Rucker had Iillcd a deer near Bucker's the day before,
and that he had promised Rucker to come back the next day
to hunt for others, and was riding by Farris' place, which was
on the road to Rucker's, with his gun in his hand, on that
errand, on the morning of January 5, when he saw a person
whom he took to be his brother Jasper up at Farris' house;

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

that this person turned out to be Farris with his brother's
coat on; but he stopped at the stable thinking that his
brother would come down that way, as he had learned from
his sister that his brother was to be at the place at that time
kfor the purpose of removing some household goods; that he
'did not go up to the house because he did not want to meet
his father; that shortly after he arrived at the barn his father
came through the gate, and he stepped to one side to let him
go into the barn if he wished to, but deceased did not go
towards the-door, came straight towards him, and when he got
a few feet from him said: "You have got it, have you? " and
threw his hand back as if he was going to get a pistol; "made
a demonstration that way," and that this demonstration and
the threats he had made led defendant to believe that he was
going to'draw a pistol, and he fired; that he fired three shots,
but none after the deceased fell. Defendant was corroborated
by iRucker and others in many particulars, but contradicted
by the government's witnesses in respect of firing after his
father was down, they testifying that he fell at the first shot.
.M. William -1. Cravens for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Assistant Attorney GeneraZ Thitney for defendants in

error.
M . OCmEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
It was claimed on behalf of defendant that the homicide
was excusable because committed in self-defence, in that, his
life having been repeatedly threatened by deceased, when he
saw him on this occasibn moving his hand as if to take a pistol from his hip pocket, he believed, and, as a prudent man,
might reasonably have believed, at that time and under those
circumstances, that he was in imminent and deadly peril which
could only be averted by the course he pursued; or that, at the
most, he could only be found guilty of manslaughter for acting
under an unreasonable access of fear, but without malice.
The threats were conceded; and there was evidence that

ALLISON v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

-the deceased was in the habit-of carrying a pistol; that he had
recently carried one in his hip pocket; that he had sent word
to defendant that he should kill him on sight; that defendant
had started on a hunting expedition that morning; and that
his stopping at Farris' place was accidental; but the facts
that he at first stepped away from his father, and that the
latter advanced on him and made the threatening demonstration as if to draw a pistol, which the defendant knew he was
accustomed to have upon him, apparently depended on defendant's testimony alone. The question for the jury to determine, from all the facts and circumstances adduced in evidence,
was the reasonableness of the belief, or fear, of the existence
of such peril of death or great bodily harm as would excuse
the killing. And it was for the jury to test the credibility
of the defendant as a witliess, giving his testimony such
weight under all the circumstances as they thought it entitled
to, as in the instance of other witnesses, uninfluenced by instructions which might operate to strip him of the competency accorded by the law.
We repeat what was said by -Mr. Justice Shiras, speaking
for the court, in -Hicks v. United States, 150 U. S. 442, 452:
"It is not unusual to warn juries that they should be careful
in giving effect to the testimony of accomplices, and, perhaps,
a judge cannot be considered as going out of his province in
giving similar caution as to the testimony of the accused
person. Still, it must be remembered, that men may testify
truthfully, although their lives hang in the balance, and that
the law, in its wisdom, has provided that the accused shall
have the right to testify in his own behalf. Such a privilege
would be a vain one if the judge, to whose lightest word the
jury properly enough give a great Weight, should Intimate
that the dreadful condition in which the accused finds himself
should deprive his testimony of probability. The wise and
humane provision of the law is, that 'the person charged shall
at his own request, and not otherwise, be a competent witness.' The policy of this enactment should not be defeated
by hostile intimations of the trial judge, whose duty it is to
give reasonable effect and force to the law."

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

Similar views have been expressed in many cases in the
state courts.
In Commonwealth v. vpight, 107 Mass. 403, it was held that
thern was no presumption either way as to the truthfulness of
a defendant's testimony in a criminal case, and that his testimony is to be considered and weighed by the jury, taking all
the circumstances of the case and all the other evidence into
consideration, and giving such weight to the testimony as in
their judgment it ought to have.
"It cannot," observed Scholfield, J., in Chambers v. The
People, 105 Illinois, 409, "be true that the evidence given by
the defendant charged with crime is not to be treated the
same as the evidence of other witnesses. It could not even
be true, as a universal proposition, that, as matter of law, it is
not to have the same effect as the evidence of other witnesses.
Many times it certainly cannot have that effect, but there are
times when it can and should, - and of this the jury are made
the judges."
And see Greer v. State. 53 Indiana, 420; Veatch v. State,
56 Indiana, 584; Buckley v. State, 62 Mississippi, 705; State
v. Johnson, 16 iNevada, 36.
Among the errors assigned in the present case was one to
so much of the charge as is given below in italics, in respect
of which a sufficient exception was preserved. The trial judge
said:
"You have heard in argument here, incidentally dropped,
no doubt, because these things have been repeated here so
often in this court that every child knows what the law of
self-defence is, that if a man thinks he has a right to slay he
can slay. That is a great misapprehension of what this propieans.- If that was the
osition of the law is and what it,
case how many men, when they were arraigned for the killing
of a human being, would not assert that they thought they
had a right to kill; they might be mistaken, but they thought
so. They perhaps had a misunderstanding of the law, but
then they thought they had the right to kill. What a perversion of this protection agency called the law of the land
this would be 1 No, that is not the law. It must be shown

by the evidence that the party who was slain was at the time
doing something that would satisfy .areasonable man, situated
as was the defendant, that the deceased, William Allison, then
and there was about to do that which would destroy the life
of the defendant, and that he could no. prevent.it except by
doing as he did do. The question as to whether that is the
state of case or not is a question that isto be fnallypassed upon
by the.juries of the country, and by you in this case, and you
must have something more tangible, More real, more certain,
than that which is a simple declaratibn of the party who slays,
made in your presence -by him as a witness- when he is confronted with a charge of murder; All men would say that.
_Nro man breated would say otherwise when confronted by such
circumstances, and the juries, as a matter of fact, would have
nothing to do but to record the finding which was willed or
.esaablishedby the declarationof the party who did the klling."
In this there was error. While the trial judge may not
have intended to be understood that the defendant could
not prove his defence by his own testimony, and had it in his
mind simply to warn the jury. that they should not rely on
the defendant's opinion that his conduct was justifiable, but
on the facts, or what reasonably appeared to him to be such,
we think these:..remarks had a much' wider scope, and
must have beeh so understood by the jury. The "state of
case" put to the jury was whether William Allison was at
the time doing something that would satisfy a reasonable
man, situated as defendant was, that he was about to do what
would destroy defendant's life,; and which defendant could not,
prevent except by doing as he did; and the question as to the
existence of that state of case was required by the instruction
to be passed on by the jury on something more than. defendant's declaration, which, it was stated, would certainly- be
made by any mai. created when confronted with .acharge of
murder.
Defendant had testified to the facts upon which he based
his belief that he was in peril, and itWas for the jury to say
from the evidence whether t1~e facts as he stated them actually or apparently existed, and whether the.homicide could,

Opinion of the Court.

therefore, be excused either wholly or in part. And if the
jury regarded the remarks of the court as applicable generally
to defendant's testimony, then defendant was practically deprived of its benefit, and the statute enabling him to testify
was rendered unavailing. In our opinion the liability of -the
jury to thus understand these observations was so great that
their utterance constitutes reversible error.
Nor was this error obviated by what, some time after -the
intervening portion of the charge occupies six closely printed
pages - was said by the trial judge, as follows : "The defendant has gone upon the stand, and he has made his statement.
See if it is in harmony with the statements of witnesses you
find to be reliable. If they are not, they stand before you as
contradicted. If they are, they stand before you as strengthened as you may attach credit to the corroborating facts. In
passing upon his evidence you are necessarily to .consider his
interest in the result of this trial, in the result of this case.
He is related to the case more intimately than anybody else,
and you are to apply the principle of the law that is laid
down everywhere in all civilized countries, commanding you
to look at a man's statements in the light of the interest that
he has in the case. There is no odor of sanctity thrown
around the statements of the defendant as a witness, as is
sometimes supposed, because he is charged with crime. You
are to view his statements in the light of their consistency, their
reasonableness, and their probability, the same as the statements of any other witness, and you are to look at them in
the light of the interest he has in the result of the case." If
this could be, in any aspect, treated as a modification of the
previous assertions of the court, it was too far separated from
that connection 'to permit us to attribute that operation to it,
ahd, moreover, it was in itself erroneous. As a witness, a defendant is no more to be visited with condemnation than he
is to be clothed -with sanctity, simply because he is under accusation, and there is no presumption of law in favor of or
against his truthfulness.
Exception was taken, not with much precision, but, we aredisposed to hold, sufficiently to save the point, to the following

ALLISON v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

instruction, given in discussing the question of malice aforethought:
"Now, of course, you are to distinguish (and I have to beparticular upon this point; I have my reasons for it, aiid it is
not necessary to name to you what they are) between a case
where a man prepares simply to defend himself and keeps
himself in the right in that defence, and a state of case where
he prepares himself recklessly, wantonly, and without' just
cause to take the life of another. If he prepares himself in the
latter way, and he is on the lookout for the man he has thus
prepared himself to kill and he kills him upon sight, that is murder, and it would shock humanity or even the most technical
and hair splitting court to decide anything else. That can be
nothing else but murder. If he is in the right - if he is in
the right at the time of the killing - and simply prepared himself to defend his. own life, that is preparation not to take the
life of another, but preparation to defend himself. That is
the distinction, a distinction that is clear and comprehensive."
And also to this in reference to the exercise of the right of
self-defence:
"The first proposition is as follows: ' A man, who, in the
lawful pursuit of his business' -I will tell you after a while
what is meant by that. I will tell you, in short, in this connection it means that the man is doing at the time just exactly
what he had a right to do under the law. When so situated
- is attacked by another under circumstances which denote
an intention to take away his lie, or to do him some enormous
bodily harm, may lawfully kill the assailant, provided he uses
all the means in his power, otherwise, to save his own life or
to prevent the intended harm -such as retreating as far as he
can, or disabling his adversary without killing him, if it be in
his power.' Now, that means by its very language that the
party was in the right at the time. If he was hunting up his
father for' the purpose of getting an opportunity to slay him
without just cause and in the absence of legal provocation, he
was not in the right, and the consequence would be that he
would be deprived of the law of self-defence, as you willlearn
presently, when such a condition as that exists. Now, of

OCTOBEIR TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

and I am this particular again for
certain reasons -you are to draw the distinction between a
state of case where a man arms himself, where there is ill will,
or grudge, or spite, or animosity, existing, and he hunts up his
adversary and slays him, and the state of case where he simply
arms himself for self-defence. He has a right to do the latter
as long as he is in the right, but he has no right to do the
former, and if he does the former and slays because of that
condition he is guilty of murder."
We are of opinion that defendant's objections to these portion§ of the chqrge are well founded , The hypothesis upon
which the defence rested on the trial was that John Allison
had a gun with him on the morning of the tragedy, in order
to hunt deer, and that his stopping at Farris' place, which was
on his way to Rucker's, was accidental. His testimony to
this effect was corroborated, and was not contradicted.
Justice and the law demanded that so far as reference was
made to the evidence, that which was favorable to the accused
should not be excluded. His guilt or innocence turned on a
narrow hinge, and great caution should have beela used not to
complicate and confuse the issue. But the charge above quoted
ignored the evidence tending to show that defendant had not
armed himself at all, but had a gun with him for purposes of
sport, and that his halt at Farris' had no connection whatever
with the deceased; and invited the jury to contemplate the
spectacle of a son hunting up his father with the deliberately
preconceived intention of murdering him, unrelieved by. allusion to defensive matter, which threw a different light on the
transaction.
If defendant were "in the right at the time of the killing,"
the inquiry as to how he came to be armed was immaterial,
or, at least, embraced by that expression. If there were evidence, and as to this the record permits no doubt, tending to
establish that defendant carried his gun that morning for no
purpose of offence or defence, then this disquisition of the
court was calculated to darken the light cast on the homicide
by the attendant circumstances as defeildant claimed them to
be; and of this he had, just cause to complain, even though
.course, in this connection -

ALLISON

. UNITED. STATES.

Opinion o the Court.

there were competent evidence indicating that he harbored
designs against his father's life, as frequently intimated by the
court - intimations which we fear seriously trenched on that
untrammelled determination of the facts by a jury to which
parties accused are entitled.
As will have been seen, the theory of the defence was that
defendant was in terror of. his life by reason of the threats of
deceased to take it, and was, therefore, led to interpret the
alleged menacing action of deceased as demonstrating an intention then and there to carry those threats into execution.
The bearing of the previous threats then was veqy important,
and in relation to them the trial judge admonished the jury
as follows:
"Now, then, these mitigating facts which reduce the killing
so as to make it manslaughter cannot be previous acts of violence exerted at some other time, and so far in the past as
that there was time for the blood to cool, or the party to
think or to deliberate -it cannot be an act of that kind that
can be taken into account to mitigate the crime.. Nor can
they exist in the shape of previous threats, made at some other
time than the killing, or, if you please, if the proof had shown
that they were made at the -time of the killing, because threats
of violence, mere threats of that character, cannot be used to
justify nor to mitigate a killing, unless they are coupled with
some other condition which I will give you in connection
with the law given you showing the figure that threats cut in
a case. . . . If threats were made previous to the time of
the killing, and they were not coupled with the condition that
they may be used to illustrate, as I will give it to you presently,
and the party kills because of those threats, that is evidence
of spite, that is evidence of grudge, that is evidence showing
that he kills because of ill will and special animosity existing
upon his part against the party who is slain."i
After much intervening discussion on other matters, the
subject was returned to thus:
"You want to know, of course, what figure threats cut.
Evidence has been offered here of threats made by the deceased. You want to know what office they perform in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

case, how you are to view them, whether you are to say that
the law authorizes you to say that if a man has been threatened at some time previous to the killing and that he kills
because of these threats, or he kills when no overt demonstration of violence, really or apparently, is being made by the
party slain at the time, whether or not those threats can be
taken into consideration by you to excuse that killing or to
mitigate it. . . . Now, you see, they do not cut any office
at all in favor of a defendant unless at the time, in this case,
his father was doing some act, making some actual attempt,
to execute the threat, as shown by some adt or demonstration
at the time of the killing, taken in connection with the threat,
that would induce a reasonable belief upon the part of the
slayer that it was necessary to deprive his father of life in
order to save his own or prevent some felony upon his person.
That is the law, stated plainly, as to the office of communicated threats . . . If he (the deceased) was doing some
act, or making some demonstration that really or apparently
was of a character that indicated a design to take life, then
the defendant could couple previous threats made with the act or
demonstration. Now, the act or demonstration must have gone
sufficiently far to show a reasonable purpose or to induce a rea-.
sonable belief, when coupled with threats, under the circumstances, that that was William Allison's purpose at the time.
'It must have gone to that extent. It must have gone sufficiently
far, the overt act done by him, as to induce a reasonable belief,
when coupled with threats, that that was his purpose. .
Now, you see that no matter how many threats William Allison
may have made against his family, and no matter to what extent
this family broil had gone, this defendant because of threats
of that character could not hunt him up and shoot him down
because of those threats. If that was the state of case the
threats cannot be considered in his favor, but they may be
considered to show that he killed him because of malice, because of malice aforethought existing, because of a spirit of
spite, or ill will, or grudge, that he was seeking to satisfy by
that sort of attack."
Defendant excepted to so much of these instructions as ruled

ALLISON v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

that threats to take his life might be treated as constituting
evidence of spite, or ill will, or grudge on his part.
In Wiggins v. People, 93 U. S. 465, it was held that, on a
trial for a homicide committed in an encounter, where the
question as to which of the parties commenced the attack is in
doubt, it is competent to prove threats of violence against
defendant made by deceased, though not brought to defendant's knowledge, for the evidence, though not relevant to show
the quo animo of the defendant, would be relevant, under such
circumstances, to show that at the time of the meeting deceased was seeking defendant's life.. Wharton Orim. Ev.
§ 757; Stokes v. People, 53 N. Y. 161; CdmpbeZl v. People, 16
Illinois, 17; Peopl4 v. Scoggins, 37 California, 676; Roberts
v. State, '68 Alabama, 156. It is from the dissenting opinion
in Wiggins' case that the trial judge indulged in quotation in
connection with the undisputed proposition that a peson's
life is not to be taken simply because he has made threats.
Here the threats were recent and were communicated, and
were admissible in evidence as relevant to the question- whether
defendant had reasonable cause to apprehend an attack, fatal
to life or fraught with great bodily injury, and hence was
justified in acting on a hostile demonstration and one of much
less pronounced character than if such threats had not preceded it. They were relevant because indicating cause for
apprehension of danger and reason for promptness to repel
attack, but they could not have been admitted on a record
such as this, if offered by the prosecution as tending to show
spite, ill, will, or grudge on the part of the person threatened;
nor could they, being admitted on defendant's behalf, if coupled
with an actual or apparent hostile demonstration, be turned
against him in the absence of evidence justifying such a construction. The logical inference was that these, threats excited apprehension, and another and inconsistent inference
could not be arbitrarily substituted. If defendant; to use the
graphic language of the court, hunted his father up and shot
him down merely because he had made the threats, speculation as to his mental processes was uncalled for. If defendant
committed the homicide because of the threats, in the sense

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court;

of acting upon emotions aroused by-them, then some basis
must be laid by the evidence other than the threats themselves before a particular emotion different from those they
would ordinarily inspire under the circumstances, could be
imputed as a motive for the fatal shot.
What is or is not an overt demonstration of violence varies
with the circumstances. Under some circumstances a slight
movement may justify instant action because of reasonable
apprehension of danger; under other circumstances this would
not be so. And it is for the jury, and not for the judge, passing upon the weight and effect of the evidence, to determine
how this may be. In this case it was essential to the defence
that the jury should be clearly and distinctly advised as to the
bearing of the threats and the appearance of danger, at the
moment, from defendant's standpoint, and particularliy so as
it did not appear that the deceased then had a pistol upon
him, though there was evidence that it was his habit to carry
one, and that he had had one immediately before.
We think that the language of the court inthe particulars
named is open to the criticism made in reference to like
instructions under consideration in Tompson v. United tatmes,
155 U. S. 271, 281, where we remarked: "While it is no doubt
true that previous threats will not, in all circumstances, justify
or, perhaps, even extenuate the act of the party threatened in
killing the person who uttered the threats, yet it by no means
follows that such threats, signifying ill will and hostility on
the part of the deceased, can be used by the jury as indicating
a similar state of feeling on the part of the defendant. Such
an instruction was not only misleading in itself, but it was
erroneous in the present case, for the further reason that it
omitted all reference to the conduct of the deceased at the
time of the killing, which went to show an intention then
and there to carry out the previous threats."
Other exceptions to parts of the charge were taken, but,
while not to be understood as holding that there was no error
in respect thereof, we do not feel called upon to prolong this
opinion by their consideration, and they may not arise upon
another trial.
