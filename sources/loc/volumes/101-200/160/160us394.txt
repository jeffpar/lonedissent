SPALDING v. CHANDLER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
No. 86. Argued December 2, 1895.-Decided January 6, 1896.

The Indian reservation at Sault Ste. Marie, under the treaty of June 26,
1820, with the Cippewas, continued until extinguished by the treaty of
August 2, 1855; and upon the extinguishment of the Indian title at that
time the land included in the reservation was made, by § 10 of the act of
September 4, 1841, not subject to preemption.

THE plaintiff in error claimed the land in dispute in this
controversy under an alleged preemption entry. The claim of
the defendant in error rested upon a patent from the United
States. The case is stated in the opinion of the court.

known as the "Indian Reserve," 'which land had 'been
patented by the United States to the defendant, and to have
the defendant ordered to execute a conveyance of the legal

title.
The facts in the case, as deveiopd 'upon the trial, were as
follows: On June.26, 1820, 7 Stat. 206, the Chippeway tribe
of Indians ceded to the United States sixteen square miles of
land. The tract deded commenced at the Sault and extended
two miles up and the same distafice down the river with a
depth of four miles, including a portage, the site of' the village of Sault' Ste. AMarieL and the old French fort. Schoolcraft's American Lakes,' p. 140. One of the objects of the
expedition which effected the signing of the treaty was to
prepare the way for an American garrison at the Sault.
Ib.p. 135. At the time of the signing of the treaty there
were about f6rty lodges of Chippewa Indians,. containing a
population of about two hundred souls, resident at thg Sault,
who subsisted wholly upon the whitefish Which were very
abundant at the foot of the Falls near by the village. Ib.
p. 133. The village settlement of the whites consisted of
about fifteen or twenty buildings. Ib.p.132. 'By the third
article of the treaty it was provided that "the United States
will secure to the Indians a perpetual right of fishing at th6
Falls of St. Mary's, and also a: place of encampment upon the
tract hereby ceded, convenient to the fishing ground, which
place shall not interfere with the defences of any military
work which may be erected, nor with any private rights."
The military post of Fort Brady was established on a part of
the tract within a few years following the execution of the
treaty.
On March 24, 1836, 7 Stat. 491, the Ottawa and' Chippewa
Nations ceded to the United States a large tract of territory,
including in its general limits the sixteen square miles above
mentioned. By article third of this treaty the right of fishing and encampment was preserved' to the Indians in -the
following words: "It is' understood that the reservation for

Opinion of the Court.

a place of fishing and encampment, made under the treaty of
St. Mary's, of the 16th of June, 1820, remains unaffected by
this treaty." In 1845, under the directions of the surveyor
general for the Northwest Territory a survey was made at
Sault Ste. Marie, and upon the map of said survey was noted
the territory occupied by the military, as shown by the stockade or high posts around such occupation, and also the ground
then in the occupation of the Indians under the treaty of
1820, and each of said reservations was respectively noted
upon the map as the "Military Reserve" and the "Indian
Reserve." At the time of the making of the survey of 1845
there was no occupation of the Indian reserve other than by
Indians, and a raceway bounded the reserve on the south.
By an act approved March 1, 1847, c. 32, 9 Stat. 146, Congress established the Lake Superior land district in Michigan,
embracing therein, among other land, the territQry ceded by
the Chippewas under the treaty of 1820, and provision was
made for a geological survey and examination of the lands
therein. It was provided in the closing sentence of section 2
that all non-mineral lands within said district should "be sold
in the same manner as other lands under the laws now in force
for the sale of the public lands, excepting and reserving from
such sales section sixteen in each township for the use of
schools, and such reservations as the President shall deem
necessary for public uses."
On April 3, 1847, pursuant to the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Treasury, based upon a communication from
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, acting on the
suggestion of the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury, the President
ordered that certain described lands in the northern peninsula
of Michigan, or so much thereof as miight be found necessary,
should be reserved for public uses, and in said described land
was included the north fractional half of fractional township
47 north., of range 1 east, which embraced the Indian reserve
in question as also the site of Fort Brady.
On August 25, 1847, as the result of a report of Brigadier
General Brady, commanding the Fourth Military Department,
the acting Secretary of War made application to the Commis-

Opinion of the Court.

sioner of the General Land Office "to cause to be reserved
from sale the sections colored in red o the enclosed plat, embracing sections 4, 5, and 6 of township 47,,range I ehst, and
an additional tract adjoining the last-named section 'on the
west not designated by number on the- plat." .On August 27,
1847, the Commissioner wrote to the Secretary, of the Treasury, calling his attention to the fact that sections 4, 5, and 6
of township 47 north, range 1 east, had been reserved for
public uses by the President on April 3, 1847, and requested
that the Secretary make application "to the President for an
order for the reservation of fractional, sections 1 and 2, township 47 north, range I west, under the 'same act, for the use of
Fort Brady." On August 30, 1847, this comnmunication was
transmitted to the President by the Secretary of the Treasury,
together with a diagram exhibiting the location of 'the.lands,
and the President was asked to give his sanction to the proposed reservation. "The request was compliedwith. Sections
1 and 2, township 47 north, range 1 west, lay to the westward
of theIndian reserve, and the military post as then occupie.
was east of the Indian encampment.
The report of General Brady above referred to accompanied
a plat prepared under his direction by Lieutenant -Westcott,
commandant at Fort Brady, of land- which had been surveyed
for military purposes. General Brady stated in his report "In making this reserve, I kept in- view the probability
that some day the government might build there a pernianent work.
"As you have in your letter: of instructions to me on this
subject desired me to give my views in relation to that post, I
shall merely observe that I believe thait the best interests of
the government-and that' of the comnmunity at large would
be benefited by the government not offering for sale any of 'the
lots fronting on the line of the canal from the reserve to the
head of the rapids, believing, as I m6st assuredly. do, that

a ship canal there no one can know, and until the canal is
made those lots had better remain with the present owner.
Should they go into the hands of individuals before the canal
is completed, great would be the expense to get back the land
necessary for the completion of this important wor ."
The village of Sault Ste. Marie 'was incorporated by the
legislature of MichiganApril 2, 1849, (Laws of Michigan, 1849,
No. 255, pp. 336, 337,) and included within its boundaries the
military reserve of Fort Brady and the Indian reserve.
This act of incorporation was repealed in 1851, but while in
force, to wit, on September 26, 1850 c. 71, an act was approved, 9 Stat. 469, which provided for the examination and
settlement of claims for land at the Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan. By section 2 of the act, the Commissioner of the General Land Office was, authorized to cause the register and
receiver of the land office at Sault Ste. Marie to be furnished
with a map, on a large scale, of the lines of the public surveys
at the Sault Ste. Marie. And it was further provided in said
§ection that : "It shall be the duty. of the Secretary of War
to direct the proper military officer, on the application of the
register and receiver, to designate or cause to be designated
upon the map aforesaid the position and the extent of lots
necessary for military purposes, as also the position and the
extent of any other lot or lots which may be required for
other public purposes, and also the position and the extent of
the Indian agency tract and of the Indian reserve." Specific
directions with regard to the survey and map in question were
also given in the seventh section of the act.
On February 15, 1853, the Commissioner of the General
Land Office acknowledged receipt of a communication from
the register and receiver at Sault Ste. Marie, of date 24th of
September, 1852, wherein it had been suggested tbat a modification be made of the western boundary of the military reservation, so as to obviate a conflict with town and town lot claims,
and the Commissioner advised the register and receiver that
the Secretary of War had approved of the Westcott survey
as the true limits of the military reservation. In their report
of April 4, 1853, on the settlement of land claims at Sault Ste.

Marie, the register and receiver, under the head of " Reservations," say: "In accordance with the second section of said
act, (September 26, 1850,) and the instructions, the military
reservation of Fort Brady, according to IWestcott's survey,'
so called, the Indian reserve, the' Indian agency reserve and
the Ste. Marie's canal reservation, of four hundred feet in
width, as located by Capt. Canfield on the 14th of October,
1852, acting under authority from the governor of Michigan,
have been designated on the plat of the public survey of said
village accompanying our abstracts, and our adjudications have
been confined strictly to claims outside of said reservation, and
in no instance have we confirmed claims, or any portion of
the same, within said reservations."
The survey under the act of 1850 is known as the Whelpley
survey. As the map of survey indicates, the limits of the
military reserve shown by the survey embraced simply the
land required for the then use and occupation of the fort, and
not the land reserved in. 184'7 by.the orders of the President.
The military reserve noted on the Whelpley map lay outside
of and to the east of the Indian reserve. Pending the settleiient of the claims of settlers on-the lands at Sault Ste. Marie,
under this act of 1850, an act of Congress was approved
August 26, 1852, c. 92, 10 Stat. 35, granting to the State of
Michigan the right of way and a donation of public lands for
the construction of a ship canal round the Falls of St. Mary.
The work of constructing this canal was begun in 1852, and it
was completed in the year 1855, and, as authorized and constructed, extended entirely across the Indian reserve as delineated.on the 1845 and Whelpley maps of surveys, cutting, the
reservation into three parts, two of which lay north of the
canal and one south of the canal.
August 2, 1855, thee Ohippewa Indians released to the
United States, 1:1 Stat. 631, the privileges retained by them
under the treaty .of 1820. The language employed was:
"The said Chippewi. Indians surrender to the United States
the right of fishing at the Falls of St. Mary's, and of encampment convenient to the fishing grounds, secured to them by
the treaty of June 16, 1820."

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

On September 10, 1859, one Byron D. Adsitt built a small
house on one of the tracts north of the canal, went into possession of the same, fenced a portion of the land, and planted
a small garden. A month thereafter he paid $45.63 to the
register of the land office at Marquette, Michigan, and entered
for preemption "the lot designated on the maps of the United
States survey in the land office at Marquette, Michigan, as
Indian reserve, (subject to all the provisions, requirements,
and conditions of the act of Congress, entitled ' An act granting to the State of Michigan the right of way and a donation
of public land for the construction of a ship canal around the
Falls of Ste. Mary's in said State,') in section six (6) township
47 north of range 1 east." The described land was said to
contain 36.50 acres of land, be the same more or less. The
papers in the case were forwarded to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office at Washington, who replied on April 9,
1860, that the claim was cancelled, because the land claimed
was not subject to preemption, and the register was directed
to note the cancellation on his books and plats, and to notify
Adsitt to make application for a refunding of his payment.
The Commissioner called the attention of the register to a
previous letter of June 9, 1853, by which two claims were
cancelled, because within the "reservation for Fort Brady,"
as -made by the President's order of September 2, 1847,
heretofore referred to.
The evidence introduced at the trial was to the effect that
this tract called the Indian reserve was occupied by the Indians
to the knowledge of witnesses from 1845 to 1885, the Indians
living at first in wigwams and latterly in log houses, and
about the time of Adsitt's attempted preemption the Indians
had at least a half dozen houses on the reserve north of the
canal, those located there being employed at fishing in the
rapids, or in carrying people over the rapids, and selling their
catch of fish to the post, villagers and those passing through
the canal in boats. They were not known to raise any crops
from the land. The ground was rocky and not suitable for
agricultural purposes.
On August 7,1860, Adsitt, for the expressed consideration.

of one dollar, conveyed, by quitclaim deed, all his right and
title in the lands in question to plaintiff in error. Spalding,
however, testified that the actual consideration paid by him
was hot less than one hundred dollars. * He did not occupy
the property.
On May 17, 1881, the defendant located what was known.
as Porterfield scrip on the particular tract in the reserve, upon
which Adsitt had erected the house. Upon learning of the
application for a patent, complainant recorded the deed from
Adsitt,. and mailed a written protest against the issuance of a
patent to the land department at Washington. The Commissioner of the General Land. Office replied to Spalding, by
letter of date January 18, 1882, informing him that Adsitt's
entry had been cancelled April 9, 1860, and directed him to
apply for a refinding of the purchase money, enclosing blanks
therefor. On December 15, 1883, a patent for the land
(9.101 acres) was issued to defendant in error. Between the
fall of 1887 and the spring of 1888 a canal was dug to furnish
power, and an electric light plant was constructed upon the
tract. The aggregate cost of the plant, with the machinery
therein, was in the neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars.
Spalding knew of the improvements as they progressed, but
took no steps to assert his alleged rights until the filing of the
bill in this action, November, 1888. The testimony for the
defence tended to show that the land was of no value except
for the purpose of water power.
. Upon the hearing of.the cause in the Chippewa Circuit
Court, a decree was entered for the defendant, and, on appeal,
the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
State. The cause was then brought into this court by writ of
error.
While we are strongly inclined to the opinion that the circumstances of this case are not such as should call into active
exercise the powers of a court of equity on behalf-of the complainant, even though his grantor upon his attempted entry
of the Indian reserve was entitled to a patent upon the certificate issued to him by the receiver of the land office at Marquette, we have concluded to dispose of the case on the ground

Opinion of the Court.

upon which the Supreme Court of the State based their affirmance of the judgment of the trial court, to wit, that the land
sought to be preempted was land which had been an Indian
.reservation, the Indian titlie to which had been extinguished
while the preemption act of September 4, 1841, c. 16, 5 Stat.
453, was in force. By the tenth. section of that act it was
provided that no "Indian reservation to which the title has
been or may be extinguished by the United States at any
time during the operation of this act

.

.

.

shall be liable

to entry under and by virtue of the provisions of this act."
The reasons for the exemption from preemption of land
which had been used as an Indian reservation are clearly set
forth in the opinion of the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, announced in Roots v. Shields, 1 Woolworth, 340.
He said (p. 362): "Whenever a town springs up upon the
public lands, adjoining lands appreciate in value. .The reasons
are obvious, and the fact is well known. So, too, when a railroad is built through a section of country, the same result
follows. So, too, in respect of lands which have been reserved
for the use of an Indian tribe, when the Indian title is extinguished, the same may be said. While such lands are held as
reserve, population flows up to their boundaries and is there
staid; it of course constantly grows more and more dense, so
that when the reserve is vacated the lands have increased in
value, and are always eagerly sought after. The other classes
of lands mentioned in the exception, as, for instance, those on
which are situated any known salines or mines, have some
intrinsic value above others. Now all these classes of lands
are excepted from thb operation of the act, and for one common and obvious reason, that being of special value, the government desires to retain the advanta'ge of their appreciation,
and is unwilling that any individual, because of a priority of
settlement, which certainly can be of but brief duration, should,
to the exclusion of others equally meritorious, reap benefits
which he did. not sow."
It has been settled by repeated adjudications of this court
that the fee of the lands in this country in the original occupation of the Indian 1ribes was from the time of the formation

SPALDING v. CEANDLER.

of this government vested in the United States. The Indian
title as against the United States was merely a title and right
to the perpetual occupancy of the land with the privilege of
using it in such mode as they saw fit until such right of occupation had been surrendered to the government. When Indian
reservations were created, either by treaty or executive order,
the Indians held the land by the same character of title, to
wit, the right to possess and occupy the lands for the uses and
purposes designated. By the treaty of June 16, 1820, the Indians ceded to the
United States a tract of land lying between the Big Rock and
Little Rapid in the river, St. Mary's, and running back from
the river so as to include sixteen square miles of land, but by
the third article of the treaty it was provided that the " United
States will secure to the Indians a perpetual right of fishing
at the Falls of St. Mary's, and also a place of encampment
upon the tract hereby ceded, convenient to the fishing grounds,
which place shall not interfere with the defences of any military work which may be erected, nor with any private rights."
It is not necessary to determine how the reservation of the
particular tract subsequently known as the "Indian Reserve"
came to be made. It is clearly inferable from the evidence
contained in the record that at the time of the making-of the
treaty of June 16, 1820, the Chippewa tribe of Indians were
in the actual occupation and use of this Indian reserve as an
encampment for the pursuit of fishing.. This view is confirmed by the provisions of the second article of the treaty of
August 2, 1855, 11 Stat. 631, by which treaty, in the first
article thereof, "the Indians surrendered to the United States
the right of fishing at the Falls of St. Mary's, and of encampment convenient to the fishing grounds, secured to them by,
the treaty of June 16, 1820." By said secoid article it was
provided that: "The United States will appoint a commis
sioner who shall, within six months after the ratification of
this treaty, personally visit and examine the said fishery and'
place of encampment, and determine the value of the interest'
of the Indians therein as the same originally existed."
But whether the Indians simply continued to encamp where

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

they had been accustomed to prior to the making of the treaty
of 1820, whether a selection of the tract afterwards known as
the Indian reserve was made by the Indians subsequent to the
making of the treaty and acquiesced in by the United States
government, or whether the selection was made by the government and acquiesced in by the Indians, is immaterial.
The clear duty rested upon the government to see that a
tract was reserved for the purposes designated in the treaty.
United States v. Carpenter,111 U. S. 347, 349. If a survey
was necessary for that purpose, it was the duty of the government to cause such survey to be made (Ib.), and -it appears
from the evidence that in 1845, in a survey, made by the
authority of the government, the exterior boundaries of
the Indian reservation were delineated upon the map of
the survey then made, and such boundaries were subsequently adopted in the survey under the act of 1850. The
fact, therefore, is undisputed that the thirty-nine-acre tract
attempted to be pregmpted by Adsitt was accepted by both
parties to the treaty of 1820 as a place of encampment, in
conformity to the treaty of 1820, convenient to the fishing
grounds, and a place which did not interfere with the defences
of any military work then or thereafter contemplated to be
erected, nor with any private rights. If the reservation was
free from objection by the government, it was as effectual as
though the particular tract to be used was specifically designated by boundaries in the treaty itself. The reservation thus
created stood precisely in the same category as other Indian
reservations, whether established for general or limited uses,
and whether made by the direct authority 5f Congress in the
ratification of a treaty or indirectly through the medium of a
duly authorized executive officer.
It is fairly to be implied from the language employed in the
third article of the treaty of 1820 that an encampment location retained, selected, or assigned, as the case might be,
reserved for the use specified in the treaty of 1820, should not
thereafter be appropriated by the government for other uses
than the defences of any military work. Private rights could
not, without the authority of Congress, be acquired in the

Opinion of the Court.

tract during the occupancy of the reservation under the treaty,
for the lands in question lost their character as public lands in
being set apart or occupied under the treaty, and. became
exempt from sale.and preemption. -Missou'i,Kansas & Texas
.Raiwa~yv., Roberts, 152 U. S. 114, 116, 118.
On the trial below there was no attempt to prove that Congress ever made provision for the erection of military works
which rendered necessary an intrusion upon the fishing encampment. The land actually appropriated for the then use
of Fort Brady was located considerably to the east of the
Indian reserve, and private settlements were made upon the
intervening lands. The general grant of authority conferred
upon the President by the act of March 1, 184:7, c. 32, 9 Stat.
146, to set apart such portion of lands within the land district
then created as were necessary for public uses, cannot be
considered as empowering him to interfere with reservations
existing by force of a treaty. The land was appropriated in
a sense which exempted it from a reservation'made in such
general terms, at least so long as the Indian right of user
remained unextinguished.
In the absence of express authority to set apart for public
uses lands already reserved and appropriated for a particular
use, we cannot infer an intention in the grant of power contained in the act of 1847 to authorize interference with the
Indian reservation, particularly when such appropriation, as
the record- shows, was not made for then existing public
necessities, but, as the letter of General Brady set out in the
statement of facts shows, was merely a provision contemplated
for the possibilities of the future, both with reference to a
canal and the enlargement of military works, neither of which
projects had then been sanctioned by Congress. The purposes
of the treaty could not be defeated by the action of executive
officers of the government. United States v. Carpenter,supra.
As a mdtter of fact, therefore, the Indian reserve continued to
exist and to be used for the purposes for which it came into
existence long after the President's orders of 1847. As stated,
the reserve was not extinguished or the rights of the Indians
to the use of the tract destroyied or curtailed by those orders,

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

and if the reservation for public uses and for the purposes of
Fort Brady made by the President's orders was valid, the
operation of those orders so far as the Indian reserve was concerned was clearly postponed until after the extinguishment
of the reserve either by a voluntary cession to the government, a cessation or abandonment of the use or the arbitrary
exercise by Congress of its power to appropriate the same.
The eiistence of the reserve, however, was expressly recognized by Congress in the act of September 26, 1850, authorizing the ascertainment and settlement of claims to lands at
Sault Ste. Marie. 'The map of the survey ordered to be made
of the village was required to have noted upon it the boundaries not only of the military reserve, but of the Indian
reserve. We conclude, therefore, that, until the treaty of
August 2, 1855, this Indian reservation was not extinguished.
It is true that the act of August 26, 1852, c. 92, 10 Stat. 35,
which granted to the State of Michigan the right of locating
a canal through the public lands, known as the military reservation at the Falls at St. Mary's River in said State, authorized by such description the location of the canal mainly
across and through the Indian reserve. It seems probable
that the bill in question was drafted after consultation and
with the approval of the War Department, the officials of
which department had in 1847 sought the reservation by the
President of lands at Sault Ste. Marie, in the belief that a
canal was not a far distant possibility, and the designation of
the land in question as the military reservation may properly
be ascribed to that source. There is nowhere contained in
the act, however, an allusion to the treaty of 1820, or an
express declaration of an intention to interfere with the Indian
reserve or the rights of the Indians in any portion of the reserve.
And the express recognition by Congress of the existence of
the reserve contained in the act of 1850, under which proceedings were being had at the time of the passage of the act of
1852 for a survey of the village and a map of the same, with
the notation thereon of the various reservations, forbids the
assumption that Congress no longer, regarded the Indian
reserve as in existence. Whatever the reason, however, for

SPALDING v' CJtANDLER.
Opinion *of the Court.

the omission to make mention .ofthe Indian reserve, the power
existed in Congress to invade the sanctity of the reservation
and disregard the guarantee contained in the treaty of 1820,
even against the consent of the Indians, party to that treaty,
and as the requirement of the grant necessarily demanded the
possession of the portion of the reserve through which the
canal was to pass, the effe6t of that act was to extinguish so
much of the Indian reserve as was embraced in the grant to
the State for canal purposes. Wi.souri, Zansas & Texas
Railway v. Robe'ts, ssura, 116-117 .
As to the remaining portions of the reserve, however, the
use and the right of use by the Indians continued, and, until
they surrendered that right by the treaty of 1855, the reservecontinued to exist. If the reservations made by the orders of
1847 were not then operativeit is clear that upon the extinguishment of the Indian title to possess and occupy the reserve
the land stood simply in the category of lands included within
an Indian reservation, the title to which had been extinguished
by the United States during the operation of the act of September 4, 1841, c. 16, and, consequently, by the tenth section
of that act, 5 Stat. 456, the land was not subject to preemption. It follows that the attempted preEmption-by Adsitt in
1859 was illegal, the Commissioner of the General Land Office
properly ordered the cancellation of the entry certificate, the
plaintiff in error acquired no right to the land in question by
the quitclaim deed of Adsitt, and hence his bill wasproperly
dismissed. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State
of Michigan is, therefore,
