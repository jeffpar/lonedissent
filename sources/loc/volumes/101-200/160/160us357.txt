BARTLETT v. LOCKWOOD.
Syllabus..

3. The admission of certain statements made by the defendants while they were under arrest and handcuffed was also
objected to. No exception was taken to- the admission of
this testimony, and the court properly held that the mere
presence of officers is not an influence. Confessions are not
rendered inadmissible by the fact that the parties are in
custody, provided that such confessions. are not extorted by
inducements or threats. Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 588;
Sarf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 55. The so called confessions~show merely that the defendants acted in a somewhat
suspicious manner when first arrested, saying, "If we killed
him, you prove it;" "that is for us to know, and you to find
out." And that they refused to tell their names. There was
clearly no objection to this testimony.
No exception was taken to the charge, and after a careful
reading of it, we see nothing of which the defendants were
justly entitled to complain.
The judgment is therefore

BARTLETT v. LOUKWOOD.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 95. Argued December 3,4, 1895. -Decided

January 6,1896.

In an action in the state courts of New York against the collector of the
port of New York, the health officer of that port, and the owners of
warehouses employed for public storage, to recover damages suffered by an importer of rags by reason of their having beein ordered
to the warehouses by the collector and disinfected there, and detained
until the charges for disinfection and storage were paid, a ruling by the
highest court of the State that the direction of the collector to send the
rags to the storehouses was pursuant to the requirement that they should
be disinfected, and was in aid of the health officer in the execution of his
official power by the observance of the regulations made by him - that
the collector gave no order for their disinfection - that the health officer
gave no such order- that the defendants assumed to disinfect them
without authority, and hence that their charges were illegal - but that,
as the collector had properly sent the goods to the warehouses for such

ac ion as the health authorities might see fit to take, the plaintiffs
became liable for storage and lighterage, presents no Federal question
for review by this court.

THIS was a motion to dismiss a writ of error sued out by the
firm of E. B. Bartlett & Co., defendants in the court below, to
review a judgmenc obtained against them in the Supreme
Court of New York by the firm of Lockwood & McClintock,
for a conspiracy to have certain cargoes of rags belonging to
the plaintiffs condemned as unclean and infectious property.
With the firm of E. B. Bartlett & Co. was also impleaded as
defendant Dr. William M. Smith, sued as an individual, but
alleged to be at the time of the transaction Health Officer
of the port of New York.
The complaint alleged in substance that in May, 1885, plaintiffs imported by ship Vigilant from Japan, and by barque
Battaglia from Leghorn, about three thousand bales of rags
of which plaintiffs were entitled to the possession and control; that the defendant Smith, the Health Officer of the
port, with intent to injure plaintiffs, conspired with the firm
of Bartlett & Co. to have such rags condemned as unclean and
infectious property, and to require them to be disinfected
under a process used by Bartlett & Co. so that they would be
entitled to charge plaintiffs therefor, and to hold such rags
until such charges were paid; that Smith, under color of his
office, wrongfully and unlawfully caused such rags to be taken
from the vessels, and transferred to the place of business of
said Bartlett & Co. for the purpose of having the same disinfected, although he, as well as Bartlett & Co., knew that the
rags were clean and free from any infectious matter, were
not dangerous to health, and did not require to be disinfected;
that by reason of such wrongful conspiracy and acts, the rags
were taken by Bartlett & Co. and kept by them from June 5
to October 1, during which time they were partially subjected
to a pretended process of disinfection, which Was ineffectual
and worthless for any real purpose of disinfection, and which
greatly damaged and injured the rags, but which process was
fraudulently and collusively approved of by said Smith, with intent to give Bartlett & Co. the monopoly of the disinfection of

BARTLETT v. LOCKWOOD.

rags, so that they might be able to extort from plaintiffs and
others large sums of money for such so called disinfection; that
plaintiffs protested against such conduct, demanded possession
of their rags, which defendants refused to deliver, until the
charges for'the transfer and disinfection were paid, by reason
of which acts plaintiffs suffered large damages.
The answer of defendants, Bartlett & Co., denied the conspiracy charged in the complaint; admitted defendant Smith
to be the Health Officer, but denied "that he had fall charge
and contr6l over vessels and cargoes coming into the port,
except as authorized by the statutes of the State of New York,
and the regulations of the United Statbs and the port of New
York."
The action was tried in the Supreme Court before a jury,
and a verdict rendered for-the plaintiffs as against the defendant firm of Bartlett & Co. for $8000, the jury disagreeing as
to the defendant Smith. Judgment having been entered upon
this verdict, -defendants appealed to the General Term, which,
upon a hearing before three judges, directed that, upon plain.tiffs stipulating to reduce the original judgment in the sum of
$1675.16, the judgment as to the residue be affirmetl. The
stipulation was given, and the judgment reduced accordingly.
Defendants appealed from this judgment to the Court of
Appeals, which ordered that the judgment should be reversed,
and a new trial granted unless plaintiff stipulated to reduce the
recovery of damages to $3182.52. 130 N. Y. 340. The case
being remitted to the Supreme Court, and the plaintiffs having
given the stipulation required by the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs
for $3914.05, to review which judgment defendants sued out
this writ of error.
.Mr.
eny W. GoodricA for plaintiffs in error.
The Federal questions presented are these:
(1) Has the Treasury Department the right, under section
4792 of the Revised Statutes, to order the disinfection of the
rags in question ? and

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

(2) Whether a specific designation of the place and manner of such disinfection is required to be given by the Health
Officer of the port?
The court held as follows
"The Collector, under his authority, in view of the regulation for disinfection of the rags on the two vessels adopted by
the Health Officer, was justified in directing, as he did, the
sending o the rags to these places, and the expenses of such
transfer were presumptively a lien upon the property to
which they related. No specific order or direction of the
Health Officer is essential for that purpose; it is sufficient that
it was done pursuant to regulations within his power, made
by him."
Thus, it will be seen that the question is squarely presented
as to whether the collector had the right to order the disinfection, the Court of Appeals having held that the collector
was justified in sending the goods for disinfection, and that
the charges incurred therefor were correct charges and a lien
upon the goods, but that he could not order the disinfection
withcut the specific direction of the Health Officer, and hence,
that the charges for disinfection were unlawful. The Collector, in ordering the disinfection of the goods, acted under
the authority of the Treasury Department, and that authority of the Treasury Department was derived from section
4792 of the Revised Statutes, which directed the Department
to aid the state officials, it being remembered that the state
officials had designated Baltic Stores and Robbins' IReef as the
places, and the process in this suit as the method, of disinfecting.

Mr. -Fran-

BRowN, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
There is certainly nothing in the pleadings in this case to
indicate a Federal question. It is simply an action of con-

Opinion of the Court.

spiracy to injure the -plaintiffs,and it does not appear, from
the complaint that the validity of any statute of the United
States, or of any authority exercised under the United States,
was drawn in question. The answer of the principal defendants, Bartlett & Co., sets up no claim of privilege or immunity
under any statute of the United States, or any authority
exercised thereunder. Indeed, there is nothing anywhere
in the record to indicate that any Federal statute or authority was specially set up or claimed in the state court.
Error, however, is assigned to the action of the court in
holding that, under the statutes of-the United States, neither
the Treasury Department nor the Collector had- a right to
order the disinfection of the plaintiffs' rags, and also in holding that the rags were not disinfected under the order of such
department or the Collector of Customs.
The real question is whether the acts of which plaintiffs
complain were done in pursuance of Federal or state authority, or were the unauthorized acts of the defendants themselves. While, under its power to regulate foreign and
interstate commerce, the authority of Congress to establish
quarantine regulations, and to protect the country as respects
its commerce from contagious and infectious diseases, has
never in recent years been questioned, such power has been*
allowed to remain in abeyance; and Congress, doubtless in
view of the different requirements'of different climates and
localities, and of the difficulty of framing a general law upon
the subject, has elected to permit the several States to regulate the matter of protecting the public health as to themselves seemed best. Their power to do this was recognized
by this court in .Morgan v. Louisiana, 118 U. S. 455. Congress has also confirmed such power by requiring (Rev. Stat.
4792) that "the quarantines and other restraints established by
the health laws of any State respecting any vessels arriving
in, or bound to, any port or district thereof, shall be duly
observed by the officers of the customs revenue,

and

that all such officers of the United States shall faithfully aid
in the execution of such quarantines and health laws, according to their respective powers and within their respective pre-

cincts, and as they shall be directed, from time to time, by the
Secretary of the Treasury."
Upon the trial it was shown that the Vigilant arrived at
the New York quarantine May 30, 1885, with 2920 bales of
rags belonging to the plaintiffs. The Health Officer passed
her at quarantine, and gave her a permission to proceed, which
stated as follows with respect to the cargo: "Cargo general
(rags excepted). The vessel has permission to proceed."
There was some dispute as to whether the words "rags
excepted" were a limitation upon the permission of the vessel
to proceed, or a qualification of the words "general cargo;"
The testimony of the Health Officer indicated that it meant
that the vessel was to be allowed to proceed to her dock, and
discharge her cargo, other than rags. Both parties evidently
acted upon the theory that these words did not require an unloading of. the rags at quarantine, as the vessel was allowed
to proceed, and did proceed, to her dock, and on June 1, a
permit was granted by the proper Health Officer of the city
of New York "to land and store said rags, provided the same
be not broken from the bulk in the bales they are now in."
Thereupon plaintiffs went to the custom-house to enter the
goods, but the Collector declined to receive, the entry, and
plaintiffs went with their counsel to Washington, to lay the
matter before the Secretary of the Treasury.
At this time, the subject, so far as it came within the jurisdiction of the Federal authorities, was regulated by two circulars issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, the first of which
bore date of November 15, 1884, and prohibited "the unlading in the United States of old rags shipped from and after
the 20th instant from foreign ports, or countries now or hereafter known to be infected with contagious or epidemic
diseases;" and further provided that "no old rags shall be
landed at any port of the United States except upon a certificate of the United States consular officer at the port of
departure that such rags were not gathered or baled at, or
shipped from, any infected place, or any region contiguous
thereto." The second circular, dated December 22, 1884,
modified previous circulars, and directed that "no old rags,

BARTLETT v. LOCKWOOD.
Opinion of the Court. *

except those afloat on or before January 1, 1885, on -vessels
bound directly to the United States shall be landed in the
United States from any vessel, -nor come into the, United
States by land from any foreign country, except upln disinfection, at the expense of the importers, as provided in this
circular, or as may hereafter be provided." Certain processes
of disinfection were specified in this circular, and other directions given for landing and storing rags for the purpose of
disinfection.
A letter bearing date .January 1, 1885, addressed to the
Collector of Customs at New York, in reference to the landing
and storage of rags to be disinfected, approved of the selection
of the Baltic stores in Brooklyn, which belonged to the defendants Bartlett &. Co., as a 'proper place for that purpose, and
directed that "where rags requiring disinfection form part of
a cargo, they will be. placed on lighters as fast as'discharged,
and the lighter loads will be. taken to the place .above designated." It appeared from this letter that Mr. Bartlett, one of
the defendants, had written a letter to the department, touching the selection -of a warehouse for the storage and disinfection of old rags; that the matter had been referred to the
Health Officers of New York and Brooklyn, both of whom
agreed as to the propriety .of designating the Baltic stores for
that purpose. Two days after this. letter was written, and on
January 14, the Collector of the port made a general ordek
that "on the entry of old 'rags shipped on and after the 1st
instant, and which have not been disinfected prior to importation, the permit to land will have written on the face thereof
directions to the inspector to send the igs to the Baltic stores
in Brooklyn, by bonded lighters for disinfetion ;" and further providing that, upon evidence that the rags had been
satisfactorily disinfected, an order for their delivery would be
made.
These were the iegulatiois in force at the time plaintiffs
made their visit to Washington. The Secretary of the
Treasury, upon examining the law upon the subject, became
satisfied that there was no statute which gave him any authority, except in aid of the Health Officers of the ports, (Rev.

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

Stat. § 4792,) and in accordance with such conclusion, he telegraphed the Collector of Customs on June 5 that "as to
rags per Vigilant, from "Japan, which importers claimed were
-mostly on board prior to January 1st, you are directed to
submit all to Health Officer Smith, and to be governed by
him in the matter." On June 6 the Collector wrote to the
Health Officer notifying him of the receipt of this telegram,
and asking to be advised whether, in his judgment, as Health
Officer of the port, the rags might, with safety to the public
health, be allowed to be landed, and, without disinfection, to
go into consumption. In reply to this, the Health Officer
wrote upon the same day detailing the result of many medical
conferences and sanitary investigations, and stating that he
did not claim that it was. necessary for the protection of the
public health that all rags should be disinfected, although it
was "impossible to determine what may and what may not
be admitted with absolute assurance of safety," and concluding that it seemed advisable that for the present the rule for
the disinfection of rags should be general, and that the rags
on the Vigilant should not be an exception to the rule.
He did not, however, give any positive directions that the
rags should be disinfected, and testified upon the stand that
he gave no order that these rags should be disinfected, either
at Bartlett's store or elsewhere.
Before, however, the Secretary of the Treasury had acted
in the matter, and before his telegram to the Collector of
June 5 had been sent, a general order was issued by the Collector on June 3, directing the inspector on the Vigilant to
allow to be landed and sent "to the public store No. -, E. B.
Bartlett's, South, all merchandise for which no permit or order
shall have been received by him contrary to this direction,"
with certain exceptions, that did not include rags, in the body
of the paper, although the words, "Rags, A. W. H.," were
written across the face of it. On June 9, the Collector made
a further order that "the inspector in charge of the ship
Vigilant from Hiogo, Japan, under general order made June
3, 1885, will allow to be landed and will send on bonded
lighters to Baltic stores, (E. B. Bartlett & Co.'s, South,) for

BARTL19TT v. LOCKWOOD.
Opinion of the Court.

disinfection, all rags for which no permit shall have been received, and will make return thereof, as of an order or permit."
On the.following day, June 10, the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to his conclusion that there was no statute
which gave him any authority in respect to the landing and
disinfecting of imported rags, except iii aid of the Health
Officer, issued a circular or order to all Oollectors of Customs.
in the following terms: "Whereas it has been conclusively
shown to the department that, under existing laws, no general
regulation can be legally framed, whereby the disinfection
of old rags can be accomplished in foreign ports to the satisfaction of the several health authorities, therefore it is
ordered -

"1. That all circulars of .this department concerning the
disinfection of imported old rags are hereby revoked, and that
all old rags hereafter imported from foreign countries shall
only -be admitted for entry at the 'custom-house upon the
production of permits from the health officers at the potts of
importation, duly authorizing the landing of the same.
"2. Vessels carrying, old rags, arriving at anyUnited States
quarantine, will be detained by the quarantine officers, and
held subject to the order of the proper health authorities at
the port of destination."
On the same day, Dr. Smith, the Health Officer of lNew
York, gave a certificate that the rags per ship Vigilant from
Hiogo, Japan, "to be disinfected, are not from a cholerainfected port.",
The rags were accordingly, and in pursuance of the Collector's instructions of June 9, taken to the Baltic stores and.
there disinfected by the defendants, who paid the lighter's
charges, made out a bill for these as well as for disinfecting
and storage, amounting to $4904.90, for which they claimed
a lien upon the property.
The case of the Battaglia did not differ materially from
that of the Vigilant. The barque arrived and was entered at
the custom-house on June 6, 1885, with 150 bales of rags
belonging to the plaintiffs. On June 9, a general order was
made, allowing the discharge of the cargo, but "omitting rags."

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

On June 11, the Secretary of the Treasury wrote to the Collector at New York, stating that the consignees desired to be
covered by the circular of June 10, which placed the control
-of the disinfection with the Health Officer, and that the department had no objection to this. On June 13, the Collector
enclosed a copy of this letter to the Health Officer, inquiring
of him whether he would designate the place and process
appropriate. From a letter written by the Collector to the
Secretary of the Treasury, June 19, 1885, it would appear
that the Brooklyn Commissioner of Health refused to allow
the unloading of the rags in Brooklyn unless they were
approved by the Health Officer, and that he therefore ordered,
under Rev. Stat. § 2880, the unloading of the rags and their
transfer by bonded lighter to Robbins' Reef, for disinfection,
provided the health officials of New York city would permit
such transfer from the Battaglia to the bonded lighter. On
June 17, the Health Officer certified that the rags were "to
be disinfected at Robbins' Reef, if Health Commissioner of
Brooklyn will not give permit for Baltfc stores." The
charge for the lighterage of these rags and for their disinfection and storage amounted to $409.25, for which amount
defendants claimed a lien upon them.
As we have observed already, there is nothing in the record from which a Federal question can be raised in this case.
If we look beyond the record, to the opinions of the court,
we find that the General Term held 1. That the Revised Statutes did not authorize the Collector to take possession of these rags as unclaimed goods,
and store them in a private bonded warehouse, such as the
Baltic stores.
2. That the acts of the Collector could not be justified by
sections 4792 and 4793, requiring him to aid in executing the
health laws of the State.
3. That the Health Officer did not directly order the seizure of these rags, their conveyance to-the Baltic stores fn the
one case and to Robbins' Reef in the other, and their disinfection by the disinfecting company, the defendants.
4. That the Collector, having no power to send any but

-BARTLETT v. LOCKWOOD.
Opinion of the Court.

unclaimed goods to the public stores, could not refuse a permit
for these goods to land, and cause them to'be' sent to the
public stores to be disinfected at the expense of the owner,
and if he did so, he, as well as all other persons who detained
the goods because of non-payment .of these unauthorized
charges, became liable in damages for such unauthorized detention.
5. That the act of the Collector, being without authority,
could confer no authority upon defendants to bold the goods,
until the charges incurred because of the unauthorized acts of
the Collector were paid.
Had the matter rested here. it might perhaps have been
claimed that the state court had ruled adversely to an authority exercised under the United States, but on appeal to the
Court of Appeals the judgment of the General Term was varied
to the extent of holding that the defendants were liable only
for 'detaining the goods until the'charges for disinfecti6n were
paid. That court held in substance:
1. That the direction of the Collector that the rags be sent
to the Baltic stores and Robbins' IReef was pursuant to the
requirement that they should be disinfected, and pursuant to
the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and in aid of
the Health Officer in the execution of his official power.
2. That the work of disinfection was not conducted under
the super~rision or control of the Health Officer, nor -pursuant
to his employment of the defendants and that the Health
Officer had testified that .he never gave any order for the disinfectioh of the rags, and that the defendants assumed to do
this work without any direction of the Health Officer, and
without approval by him of the efficiency of the work or the
charges resulting from it.
3. That this objection was not applicable to the charges
for lighterage and storage, and that the Collector was justified in directing, as he did, the sending of the rags to these
places, and the expense of such transfer was a lien upon the
property.
4. That the charges for lighterage paid by the
defendants,
according to the custom in such cases, and for the s.torage for

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

the time the rags properly remained with them, were a lien
upon the property.
5. That, so far as defendants required payment for the further claim for disinfection, as a condition of the delivery, they
were chargeable with duress of property, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover this amount from them.
The result, then, of this summary of the case is briefly
this:
The defendants claimed as a Federal question that they had
set up as a defence to this action an authority exercised under
the United States, viz., an authority given by the Collector of
Customs to disinfect these rags.
In relation to this, the General Term held that the Revised
Statutes gave no authority to the Collector to take possession
of these goods, and retain possession of them, and that his
seizure of the goods, and causing them to be.sent to the
Baltic stores, was an unauthorized act, and if he caused them
to be disinfected, he became liable in damages.
The Court of Appeals, however, held that the direction of
the Collector that the rags should be sent to the places where
they were taken, was pursuant to the requirement that they
should be disinfected, and in aid of the health officer in the
execution of his official power, by the observance of the regulations made by him; that the Collector gave no orderfor their
' that the Health Officer gave no such order; and
disinfection*
that the defendants assumed to disinfect them without authority, and hence their charges therefor were illegal; but that,
as the Collector had properly sent them the goods for such
action as the health authorities might see fit to take, the pliintiffs became liable for storage and lighterage.
It follows then that, as the Coudrt of Appeals ruled, as
matter of fact, that the Collector never ordered the rags to be
disinfected, (a ruling, which is not reviewable here, Dower v.
Richards, 151 U. S. 658; Irn re Buchanan, 158 U. S. 31;
sraer v. Arthur, 152 U. S. 355,) and as matter of law, that
he had the right to send 'them to the proper warehouse for
disinfection, it appears that the ruling was in favor of and not
against the validity of the authority set up and claimed under
