THE appellant brought this suit against the United States

appeal herein -for that such appeal is not authorized, by the
act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, entitled Ian act to establish
Circuit Courts of appeals,' and so forth, and because such
appeal is without the-authority of law, and this court, therefore, is without jurisdiction of said appeal -" and with this
motion was also submitted a statement of the appellants'
counsel in which, acknowledging notice of the mot( u,he said
"I am anxious that the question shall be determined, the
time you give me, however, is too short to prepare or file a
brief. I accept your communication of the 13th as notice and
waive any other, asking you in making the motion to state
to the court that, so far as appellant is concerned, the case is
submitted for construction of the statute conferring jurisdiction
on the Circuit Courts in actions against the government, and
whether that act conferring special jurisdiction with special
procedure is affected by the general act creating the Circuit
Courts of appeal."

v.

OERTIFICATE FROM THE. UNITED STATES CIROUIT COURT OF APPEAIS
FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 1124. Argued January 31, February 1, 1893.-

Decided April 3, 1893.

Following Walter v. Northeastern RailroadCompany, 147 U. S. -370, it is again
held that a Circuit Court of the United States has no jurisdiction over a bill
in equity to enjoin the collection of taxes from a railroad company, when
distinct assessments, in separate counties, no one of which amounts to
$2000, and for which, in case of payment under protest, separate suits
must be brought to recover back the amounts paid, are joined in the bill
and make an aggregate of over $2000.
As, perhaps, by amendment this bill might be retained as to some one of the
defendants, this court declines to dismiss the bill, and reverses the judgment, and remands the cause to the court below for farther proceedings
in conformity with this opinion.

THE case is stated m the opinion.
