ATCHISON BOARD OF EDUCATION v. DE KAY
ERROR TO THE CIROUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF -KA1eAS.
No. 176. Argued and submitted March 24,1893. -Decided

April 10, 1893.

The bonds issued by the city of Atchison, Kansas, January 1, 1869, pledging
the school fund, etc., of the city for payment were valid obligations.
The legislation oY Jgansas relating to cities of the first class, and to cities
of the second class, and t6 Boards of Education, reviewed.
An error of a single word in the title of a statute in copying it into a municipal bond does not vitiate the deliberate acts of the proper officers of
the municipality, as expressed in the promise to pay which they have
issued for money borrowed.
It is a general rule that, where a municipal charter commits the decision
of a matter to the council of the municipality, and is silent as to the mode
of decision,'it may be done by a resolution, and need not necessarily be
by an ordinance; and the decision in Jewman v. Empona, 32 Kansas,
456, is not in conflict with this rule.
When municipal bonds have been issued in reliance upon a consent of the
proper municipal authorities, as shown by the municipal records, and for

years thereafter, interest had been duly paid upon such bonds, the courts
will not, after the lapse of twenty years, in a suit upon the bonds, pronounce them invalid on purely technical and trivial grounds.
An express power conferred upon a municipal corporation to issue bonds
bearing interest, carries with it the power to attach interest coupons to
those bonds.
This action is properly brought against the Board of Education of the city
of Atchison, -whtch is a distinct corporation, and the proper one to be
sued for a debt like this.

Ox January 1, 1869, the Board of Education of the city of
Atchison issued $20,000.00 of bonds. They were in this form

"No. -

:fu JusTi E BREwER delivered the opinion of the court.
Two questions are presented First. Were the bonds and
coupons valid obligations? Second. If valid, was the Board
of Education of the city of Atchison the proper defendant, and
could judgment- be rightfully entered against it for the sum of
these bonds and coupons 2
The bond on its face purports to be the obligation of the
city of Atchison, secured by pledge of the school fund and
property of the city, and was executed by the president and
clerk of the Board of Education. It is insisted that the Board
of Education had no, power to bind the city by such a promise
to pay To a clear utnderstanding of this question an examination must be made of the statutes of Kansas. The city of
Atchison was incorporated under -an act of the Territory of
Kansas of February 12, 1858. Private Laws, 1858, p.'172.
By an act passed'the same day, providing for the organization,
etc., of common schools, (Public Laws, 1858, pp. 47 and 51,
c. 7, §§ 15, 37,) each county superintendent of common schools
was authorized to divide his county into school districts, and
every school district organized in pursuance of the act wai
declared to be a body corporate, possessing the usual powerof a corporation for public purposes, with the name and style
of "School District No. -, County of -"
Under that act
"school district number 1, Atchison 'County," was organized
with territorial limits, the same as those of the city of Atchison.
voL. cxLvni-38

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

On February 23, 1867, an act was passed to incorporate
cities of the second class, that class being of those cities having
more than 1000 and less than 15,000 inhabitants, to which
class the city of Atchison belonged. Laws of 1867, p. 107.
Section 14 is as follows "Each city shall constitute at least one
school district, and the city shall not be divided into more
than one school district without the consent of a majority of
the council, but such council may divide the city into as many
school districts as it may deem expedient." On February 26,
1867, a supplemental act was passed, (Laws, 1867, p. 128,) providing for a Board of Education in cities of the second class, to
have charge of school matters. Particular reference to the
provisions of this act is unnecessary, as both these acts were
superseded in the revision of 1868. General Statutes of Kansas, p. 154, c. 19. This act was entitled "An act to incorporate cities of the second class." This was a new enactment,
though practically only a consolidation and revision of the
statutes of 1867, in reference to such cities. It contained section 14, heretofore quoted, of the law of 1867, and placed, as
did the supplementary act of 1867, the entire control of school
matters in a board of education.
iNoting the act a little in detail, section 55 provides that "at
each annual city election, there shall be a Board of Education,
consisting of two members from each ward, elected," etc.
Section 5' that such board shall "exercise the sole control
over the schools and school property of the city" By section
67, the Board of Education was empowered to estimate the
amount of funds necessary to be raised by taxation for school
purposes, and report the same to the city council, by which
body the amount was levied and collected as other taxes.
Under section 68,the moneys thus collected were paid into the
hands of the city treasurer, subject to the order of the Board
of Education. Sections 69, 70, 71, 76 and 77 are as follows
"SEc. 69. The whole city shall compose a school district
for the purposes of taxation.
" SEc. 70. The title of all property held for the use or benefit of public schools shall be vested in the city
"SEc. 71. No school property of any kind shall be sold or

ATCISON BOARD OF EDUCATION v. DE KAY. 595
Opinion of the Court.

conveyed by the mayor or councilmen, except at a regular
meeting of the same, and not then without the concnrrenae'of
the Board.of Education."
"SEc. 76. Whenever it shall. become necessary, in order to
raise sufficient funds for the purchase of a school site or sites,
or to-erect a suitable building or buildings thereon, it shall be
lawful for the Board of Education of every city, coming under
the provisions of this act, with the consent of the council, to
borrow money, for which they are hereby authorized and empowered to issue bonds, bearing a rate of interest not exceeding ten/per cent per annum, payable annually or semiannually,
at such place as may be mentioned upon the face of said bonds,
which bonds shall be payable in not more than twenty years
frqm their date, and the Board of Education is hereby authorized and empowered to sell such bonds at not less than seventyfive cents on the dollar.
"SEc. 7. The bonds, the issuance of which is provided for
in the foregoing section, shall be signed by the president and
clerk of the Board of Education, and countersigned by the
treasurer, and said bonds shall specify the rate of interest, and
the time when the principal and interest shall be paid, and each
bond so issued shall be for a sum not less than-fifty dollars."
Section 78 peremptorily required the Board of Education in
its annual estimate, authorized in section 67, to include a
sufficient amount to pay the interest on such bonds and create
a sinking fund, and such amount the city council was required
to levy and collect. Section 81 reads "The school fund and
property of such city is hereby pledged to the payment of the
interest and principal of the bonds mentioned in this article,
as the same may become due."
What, now, are the specific objections to the validity of
these bonds and coupons? First, it is objected that the bond
purports to be issued under authority of an act entitled "An
act to organize cities," etc., approved February 28, 1868,
that no such act is to be found in the statutes of that year,
and that, therefore, the bonds were issued without authority
of law, and are not valid obligations. This is trifling. There
was an act giving authority to the Board of Education

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.

i

to borrow money and issue bonds, and whose title was exactly as- described in this bond, except in place of the word
"organize" the word "incorporate" was used. Fac demonstratto non nocet. Conimwswners v. January, 94 U. S.
202. An error in copying into an instrument a single word in
the title of a statute does not vitiate the deliberate acts of the
proper officers of a municipality as expressed in the promise to
pay, which they have issued for money borrowed.
Again, it is insisted that the Board of Education had no
power to bind the city of Atchison as a municipal corporation,
but only that other and quasi-corporation, known as School
District No. 1, Atchison County The argument is that there
were two corporations: First, a school district corporation
whose name and corporate existence were prescribed by the
laws of 1858, and another, a strictly municipal corporation, known as the city of Atchison, with the ordinary
powers attached to such a municipality, that though they
embraced within their limits the same territory and population, they were in fact distinct corporate entities, and that
the Board of Education, having control of the affairs of the
one corporation, had no power to bind the other by its promises to pay It may well be doubted whether there were
two distinct corporations. Section 14 of the acts of 1867
and 1868, incorporatipg cities of the second class, provided
that "each city shall constitute at least one school district."
There is no pretence, under the power reserved in that section,
that the city of Atchison was ever divided into districts, so,
by that section, Atchison city constituted a school district.
The members of the Board of Education were to be elected
at the annual city election, and to the board was given full
control of the school affairs of the city Section 57. In
other words, it was the city's schools and the city's school
property which were placed under the management of the
Board of Education. Upon the report of the Board of Education, the city council levied and collected the school taxes,
SectioA 67, and when they were collected they were retained
by the city treasurer in his custody Section 68. The title
to all school property was vested in the city Section 70.

ATCHISON BOARD OF EDUCATION v. DE ]KAY. 597
Opinion of the Court.

No bonds could be issued without the consent of the city
council. Section 76. And the school fund and property of
such city was pledged to the payment of the bonds. Section 8-1.
The whole idea of the statute seems to have been the mingling of the schools and the school interests with the ordinary
municipal functions of the city of Atchison, giving to the
Board of Education, as an administrative body of the city,
the management of the schools and the school property
Further, when, in 1872, a new act was passed m respect to
the incorporation of cities of the second class, by section 100,
Laws of 1872, p. 221, it was expressly provided that "the
public schools of each city organized in pursuance of this act,
shall be a body corporate, and shall possess the usual powers
of a corporation for public purposes by the name and style of
, of the State
'The Board of Education of the city of
of Kansas', and in that name may sue," etc. 'This legislation
seems to imply that up to that time there was in cities of
the second class no separate school corporation.
But even if this be a misconstruction of the statute, it is
clear that the school district and the city were coterminous,
that, by the act of 1868, the Board of Education was authorized to borrow on the credit of the school property, with the
consent of the city council, and to issue bonds in payment
therefor. They did proceed, as appears foiom the recital in
the bonds, under authority given by that act, and if there were
a misrecital of the name of the obligor, such mere misrecital
would not vitiate the dbligations. Proceeding strictly under
that act, they bound the corporation whose officers they were
and for which they assumed to act, and whether the name of
that corporation was technically " The City of Atchison" or
"School District No. 1, Atchison County," by the issue of
bonds they bound that corporation.
This is not the case, as counsel suggest, of a written declaration ofA. that B. is indebted, and that B. promises to pay,
nor a case where two corporations are so entirely distinct that
the name of o',e in an instrument carries no possible suggestion
that the other-was intended, but it is the case where officers
of a corporation having power to borrow and issue promises

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opimon of the Court.

to pay have at the best only misrecited the name of the corporation for which they issued and were authorized to act.
Another objection is, that there was no legal consent of the
city council, as required by section 76. The record shows that
on 'Monday, October 5, 1868, none of the councilmen being
present, the city clerk adjourned the council to Monday, October 12. On Monday, Odtober 12, the mayor and five of the
eight councilmen appeared, the minutes of all previous meetmgs not theretofore read were read and approved, and the
council adjourned until Monday, October 19. On Monday,
October 19, council met pursuant to adjournment; and another
adjournment was had until October 26, and, so, from October
26 to October 28, and thence to November 2, and to November 9. At none of these meetings were all of the city council
present. At the meeting on November 9, the mayor and five
councilmen, being a majoity of the council, were present, and
a resolution was passed giving the consent -of the council to
the issue of these bonds. iNow, it is insisted that consent
could only be given by an ordinance, and not by resolution,
and in support thereof the case of EAewmaw v. -Emporia,32
Kansas, 456, is cited, that even if a resolution were sufficient,
there was no legal meeting of the council, because all the
members were not present, and it does not appear that all were
notified, or that. a special meeting had been duly called, that
it was not at a regular, but apparently an adjourned, meeting;
and that the first adjournment, on October 5, was without
validity', because-none of the councilmen were present, and
the adjournment was ordered by the clerk alone, and in support
of the proposition that notice to or presence of all the -members
is essential to a valid special meeting,. the -cases of Paola &
Fall River Railroadv Anzderson County Cor m'rs, 16 Kansas,
302, and Aikman v School Dstrzct,27 Kansas, -129, are cited.
In respect to the first of these contentions The general
rule is, that where the charter commits the decision of a matter to-the council, and is silent as to the mode, the decision may
be evidenced by a resolution, and need not necessarily be by
an ordinance. State v Jersey City, 27 N. J. Law, (3 Dutcher,)

204 1 Dillon's Municipal Corporations, (4th ed.,) § 307 and
notes. Nor is there anything in the case -in 35 Kansas in
conflict with this. That simply holds that when a charter
requires that certain things be done by ordinance, they cannot
be done by resolution. In this act incorporating cities of the
second class there is nothing which either m terms or by implication requires that the consent of the-city council should be
given only by ordinance. A resolution was, therefore, sufficient.
Neither is the other contention of any force. The record of
the city council was produced, showing .a series of meetings
extending from October 5 to November 9, at some of which
meetings general business was transacted. The act of 1868,
section 13, provides that regular meetings of the city council
shall be held at such times as the council may provide by
ordinance. No evidence was offered showing what were the
dates of regular meetings, as provided by ordinance. We are
left to infer that these meetings were not regular meetings
from the language at the commencement of the records thereof
-"that
council, met pursuant to adjournment." The first
adjournment was made by the city clerk alone, no member of
the city council being present. We are not advised by the
testimony as to what rules, if any, had been prescribed by the
city-council in respect to such matter. It is not an uncommon
thing for legislative. bodies, such as a city council, to provide
by ruler that in the absence of all members the clerk or secretary shall have power to adjourn. That probably such a rule
as that was in existence is evidenced by the fact that at sueceeding, meetings -which, giving full weight to the language
used at the commencement of the record, were simply adjourned
meetings -the council, all but one of whom were present at
one of the meetings, approved the records. All these entries
of meeting appear to have, been kept upon the regular record
of the city council, and it is obvious that either because -an
adjournment by the clerk in the absence of the council was

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

authorized by rule, or because the days of the subsequent
meetings were, in fact, the regular days therefor, such meetings
were accepted and recognized by the council as legal. Certain
is it, that when bonds have been issued in reliance upon a consent thus evidenced, and when for years thereafter interest
has been duly paid upon such bonds, the courts will not, after
the lapse of twenty years, in a suit on the bonds, pronounce
them invalid on such technical and trivial grounds. The cases
cited from 16 and 27 Kansas do not militate against these
views. In the case in 16 Kansas, which was an action by the
county against the railway company to cancel a subscription
for stock, and for the return and cancellation of bonds of the
county on deposit with the state treasurer, the matter was
submitted on demurrer to the petition, and that petition averred
that the subscription was ordered at a special session of the
board, at which only two of the three commissioners were
present, that no call for such session was made, nor anything
done to authorize a call, that B. M. Lingo, the absent commissioner, was in the county, at his residence, but had no
knowledge or notice of such intended special session, "that
knowledge and notice of such intended special session was
intentionally and fraudulently concealed and kept from said
B. M. Lingo by the said railway company and its agents, and
said session was not a regular session of said board, nor was it
an adjourned session from any regular session thereof, nor
from any duly called special session of said board." The
court held that the subscription ordered under those circumstances was not binding upon the county In that case, the
contract was executory, and the bonds had not been delivered,
but were still within the control of the coufity The special
session, with only a fraction of the board present, was fraudulently intended and fraudulently brought about, and the railway company was the wrongdoer. The illegality of the session
was not a matter of inference, but a fact alleged and admitted.
The case in 27 Kansas is even stronger. That was a suit on
a written contract, signed by two members of a school district
board, the board consisting of three. Such a contract could
only be made by the district board, as a board. It appeared

ATCHISON BOARD OF EDUCJATION v. DE KAY. 601
Opinion of the Court.

affirmatively that there was no meeting of the board, that it
was signed by the two members, not after consultation, but by
each separately, and at a different time from the other.
-More in point is the case of Scott v Paiuen, 15 Kansas, 162,
167, in which a session of a board of county commissioners
was hela to be valid, at which only two out of the three members were present, and the record failed to show either an
adjournment to that date, or a call for a meeting at that time,
but did show that it was not held on the regular days of session, but its validity was-not challenged until some time thereafter. In the opinion in that case, w-ritten by the same judge
who wrote the opinion in the case in 16 Kansas, is this language "Hence it seems to us that when a quorum of the county
board, with the clerk, is present, assuming to act as a county
board, and at a time and place at which a legal session is possible, and to such board in actual session a proper and legal
petition is presented for a county-seat election, and an election
ordered,.and thereafter full and legal notice given of such election, two elections had, generally participated in by the electors, the result canvassed and declared, and no objection made
thereto for more than a year, it will be too late to question
the validity of the election on the ground that the record of
the proceedings of the commissioners shows that the chairman
was absent, and fails to show a session pursuant to a legal
adjournment from a regular session, or that the session was a
special session and duly called by the chairman on the request
of two members." We think, therefore, that the bonds in suit
were valid obligations, and that the Circuit Court did not err
in overruling these objections to them.
But it is further insisted that even if the bonds were valid
the coupons were not, because coupons are not named in the
section of the statute authorizing the issue of the bonds. But
coupons are simply instruments containing the promise to pay
interest, and the express authority was to issue bonds bearing
interest. While'it is true that the power to borrow money
granted to a municipal corporation does not carry with it by
implication the power to issue negotiable 'bonds, (Brenham v
German American. Bank, 144 U S. 173,) we are of opinion

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

that the express power to issue bonds bearing interest carries
with it the powbr to attach to those bonds interest coupons.
The final objection is, that the proper defendant is not sued.
The claim here is, that while by the act of 1872 the public
schools of cities of the second class were organized into a body
corporate, by the name and style of "The Board of Education
of the City of -,
of the State of Kansas," and at that time,
if not before, the real debtor was this distinct corporate entity,
yet, at the time of the commencement of this action, the city
of Atchison bad passed, by reason of the growth of its population, from a city of the second to a city of the fiist class, and
that in such cities there was no separate school corporation,
but the Board of Education was simply an administrative body,
having charge of the school affairs of the city The case of
Knowles v Topeka, 33 Kansas, 692, is a sufficient answer to
this contention. Topeka, like Atchison, had been a city of
the second class, and became by mere increase in population a
city of the first class, and in the opinion of the court in that
case, delivered by Chief Justice Horton, it is declared that "the
Board of Education of, the city of Topeka is a distinct corporation from the municipal corporation of the city of Topeka."
That case came to the Supreme Court from the Superior Court
of Shawnee County, and in the opinion in the latter court,
delivered by Webb, Judge, an opinion which is found in the
report of the case, and referred to with approval by the
Supreme Court, is this discussion of the question "Topeka
remained a city of the second class until January, 1881, when
it became a city of the first class. Article 10 of said chapter
122, Laws of 1876, relates to 'public schools in cities of the
first class.' Its provisions, as to the powers and duties of the
Board of Education, are very similar to those contained in article 11 relating to 'public schools in cities of the second class.'
But there is no provision in said article 10, declaring that ' the
public schools' or the I school district' of cities of the first class
shall be bodies corporate. Nor has the writer of this opinion
been able to find any such provision in any act or statute,
although the powers conferred by said article 10 are those usually conferred upon incorporated school districts, and the gov-
