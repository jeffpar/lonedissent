MR. JUsTIoE GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a complaint filed June 25, 1887, in a district cour
of the Territory of Arizona and county of Pima, by Dolore
G. Astiazaran and others, against the Santa Rita Land an(
Mining Company and the New M exico and Arizona Railroa(
Company, to quiet the plaintiffs' title in three tracts of land
known as ranchos Tumacacori, Calabasas and iluevavi, granted
by the Mexican government to Francisco Alejandro Aguilai
in 1844.
The plaintiffs claimed title as or under the heirs of Aguilar

Aguilar to Manuel Maria Gandara in 1856 and 1869, from
Gandara to Charles P Sykes in 1877, from Sykes of an undivided interest to John Curry in 1878, and from Sykes and
Curry on December 18, 1879, of the whole interest to the
Calabasas Land and Mining Company, whose title had since
vested in the defendants.
On June 9, 1861, Gandara presented a petition to the surveyor general for the Territory of Arizona for a survey of the
lands, in order that the title might be reported on and confirmed, in accordance with the treaty of Guadalupe IHidalgb
of 1848 and the Gadsden treaty of 1853, and the laws of the
United States.
On December 15, 1879, Curry and Sykes presented a similar
petition to the surveyor general, who on January 7, 1880,
made a report to Congress, recommending a confirmation of
their title. Congress never took final action upon this recommendation.
The district court gave judgment for the defendants, which
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory on January 19, 1889. 20 Pacific Rep. 189. The plaintiffs appealed
to this court.
By article 8 of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and article
5 of the Gadsden treaty, the property of Mexicans, within the
territory ceded by Mexico to the United States, was to be
"inviolably respected," and they and fheir heirs and grantees
were "to enjoy with respect to it guaranties equally ample as
if the same oelonged to citizens of the United States." 9 Stat.
929, 930; 10 Stat. 1035.
Undoubtedly, private rights of property within the ceded
territory were not affected by the change of sovereignty and
jurisdiction, and were entitled to protection, whether the party
had the full and absolute ownership of the land, or merely all
equitable interest therein, which required some further act of
the government to vest in him a perfect title. But the duty of
providingthe mode of securing these rights, and of fulfilling
the obligations imposed upon the Uhited States by the treaties,
belonged to the political department of thd government, and
Congress niigbt either itself discharge that duty, or delegate-it

to the judicial department. -De la Croix v Chamberlain, 12
Wheat. 599, 601, 602-, C(wouteau v Eckhart, 2 How 344, 374,
Tameling v United States Freehold Co., 93 U. S. 644, 661,

For the adjustment and confirmation of claims under grants
from the Mexican government of land in New Mexico, and in
Arizona, which was formerly, a part of it, Congress had not,
when this case was decided below, established, a judicial tribunal, as it had done in California, and as it has since done in
New Mexico and Arizona by the act of March 3, 1891, c. 539,
26 Stat. 8541.
But Congress reserved to itself the determination 6f such
claims, and enacted that the surveyor general for the Teiritory, under the instructions of the Secretary of the Interior,
should ascertain the origin, nature, character and extent of
all such claims, and for this purpose might issue notices, summon witnesses, administer oaths and do all other necessary.
acts, and should make a full report on such claims, with his
decision as to the validity or invalidity of each under the laws,
usages and customs of the country before its cession to the
United States, and that his report should be laid before Congress for such .action thereon as might be deemed just and
proper, with a view to confihm bona fide grants, and to give
full effect to the treaty of 1848 :between the United States and
Mexico. Acts of July 22, 1854, c. 103, ยง 8, 10 Stat. 309, July
15, 1870, c. 292, 16 Stat. 304.
In Tameling v Urnited States F'eehold Co., above cited, it
was therefore held that the- action of Congress, confirming,
as recommended by the.surveyor general for the Territory, a
private land claim in New Mexico, was conclusive evidence of
the claimant's title, and not subject to. judicial review, and
Mr. Justice Davis, in delivering the -opinion of the court,
said "No jurisdiction over such claims in New Mexico was
conferred upon the courts, but the sqrveyor general, in the
exercise of .the authority with which he was invested, decides
them in the -first instance. The final action on each claim,
'eserved to Congress is, of course, conclusive, and therefore
not subject to review in this or any other forum. It is obi-

ously not the duty of this court to sitin judgment upon either
the recital of matters of fact by the surveyor general, oir his
decision declaring the validity of the grant. They are embodied in his report, which was laid before Congress fTr its
consideration and action." 93'U. S. 662. See also X-axwel
Land Grant Case, 121 U S. 325,. 366, and 122 U. S. 365, 371.
The action of'Congress, when taken, being conclusive upon
the merits of the claim, it necessarily follows that the judiciary cannot act upon the matter while it is pending before
Congress, for if Congress should decide the same way as the
court, the judgment of the court would be nugatoty, and if
Congress should decide the other way, its decision would
control.
There is nothing in Pinkerton V' Ledoux, 129 U. S. 346,
cited by the appellant, inconsistent with this conclusion.
The point there decided was that the report of the.surveyor
general, not acted on:by Congress, was no. evidence to support
ejectment upon a grant from the Mexican govern'ment, known
as the Nolan graht, and Mr. Justice Bradley, in delivering.
judgment, said "The surveyor general's-report is no- evidence
of title or rib-it to possession. His duties were prescribed by
the act of July 22, 1851, before referred to, and consisted
merely in making inquiries and reporting to Congress for its
action. If Congress confirmed a title reported favorably oy
him, it became a valid title, if not, not.". And he guardedlv
added "This case seems to have been very perfunctorily tied
and discussed. There is a question which may be entitled t6
much consideration, whether th6 Nolan title has any validity
at all without corfirmation by Congress. The act. of July'22,
1854, before referred to, seems to imply that this was necessary" 129 U S. 351, 352, 355.
The case is one of those, jurisdiation of which has been committed to a particular tribunal, and which cannot, therefore, at
least while proceedings- are pending before that tribunal, be
taken up and decided by any other. Johnson v. Tossly, 13
