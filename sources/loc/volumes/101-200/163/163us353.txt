TEXAS AND PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v.
GENTRY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 258. Argued April 29,1896.-Delded May 18,1896.

In this case, while there was in form a separate judgment, In favor of each
of the persons for whose benefit the action was brought, the statute of
Texas creates a single liability on the part of the defendant, and contemplates but one action for the sole and exclusive benefit of the surviving husband, wife, children and parents of the persons whose death
was caused in any of the specified modes.
A decree or judgment by the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming a decree
or judgment of a Circuit Court, without specifying the sum for which
it Is rendered, Is a final decree or judgment, from which an appeal or
writ of error will lie to this court.
This case was onepeculiarly for the jury, under appropriate instructions from
the court as to the principles of law by which they were to be guided in
reaching a conclusion as to the liability of the railroad company for the
death of Its employd; and the positions taken to the contrary have no
merit.
The law presumes in the entire absence of evidence,that a railroad employ6,
in crossing the track of the railroad on foot at night to go to his duty,
looks and listens for coming trains before crossing.
It is only when facts are such that all reasonable men must draw the same
conclusion from them, that the question of negligence Is ever considered
as one of law for the court.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action to recover damages alleged to have been
sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendant railway company, the present plaintiff in error, resulting in the
death of Louis D. Gentry. It was brought in the Circuit
Court of Dallas County, Texas, and was removed into the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District
of Texas on the petition of the defendant, a corporation
created under acts of Congress.
The deceased left surviving him his mother, the plaintiff
Mfary A. Gentry, seventy-five years old, and dependent upon
him for support; his wife, the plaintiff May Gentry, twentysix years of age; and two children, the plaintiffs Olive Lee
Gentry and Thomas M. Gentry, six and two years of age,
respectively.
By the statutes of Texas, in force when the alleged injuries
were received, it was provided:
"ART. 2899. An action for actual damages on account of
injuries causing the -death of any person may be brought in
the following cases: 1. When the death of any person is
caused by the negligence or carelessness of the proprietor,
owner, charterer or hirer of any railroad, steamboat, stage
coach or other vehicle for the conveyance of goods or passen-.
gers, or by the unfitness, negligence or carelessness of their
servants or agents. 2. When the death of any person is
caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskilfulness or default of another.
"ART. 2900. The wrongful act, negligence, carelessness,
unskilfulness or default mentioned in the preceding article
must be of such a character as would, if death had not ensued,

have entitled the party injured to maintain an action for such
injury.
"ART. 2901. When the death is caused by the wilful act or
omission or gross negligence of the defendant, exemplary as
well as actual damages may be recovered.
"ART. 2902. The action may be commenced and prosecuted,
although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amounts in law to a felony, and without regard to
any criminal proceeding that may or may not be had in relation to the homicide.
"ART. 2903. The action shall be for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the surviving husband, wife, children and parents
of the person whose death shall have been so caused, and the
amount recovered therein shall not be liable for the debts of
the deceased.
"AT. 2904. The action may be brought by all of the parties
entitled thereto, or by any one or more of them for the benefit of all.
"ART. 2905. If the parties entitled to the benefit of the
action shall fail to commence the same within three calendar
months after the death of the deceased, it shall be the duty of
the executor or administrator of the deceased to commence
and prosecute the action, unless requested by all of the parties
entitled thereto not to prosecute the same.
"ART. 2906. The action shall not abate by the death of
either party to the record if any person entitled to the benefit
of the action survives. If the plaintiff die pending the suit,
when there is only one plaintiff, some one or more of the
parties entitled to the money recovered may, by order of the
court, be made plaintiff and the suit be prosecuted to judgment
in the name of such plaintiff for the benefit of the persons
entitled.
"Awr. 2907. If the sole plaintiff die pending the suit, and
he is the only party entitled to the money recovered, the suit
shall abate.
"ART. 2908. If the defendant die pending the suit, his executor or administrator may be made a party, and the suit be
prosecuted to judgment as though such defendant had con-

tinned alive. The judgment in this case, if rendered in favor
of the plaintiff, shall be paid in due course of administration.
"AT. 2909. The jury may give such damages as they may
think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death;
-and the amount so recovered shall be divided among the persons entitled to the benefit of the action, or such of them as
shall then be alive, in such shares as the jury shall find by
their verdict." Sayles' Tex. Civ. Stat.
There was a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs as follows:
"We, the jury, find for the plaintiffs ($10,166.66) ten thousand one hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cents,
apportioned among plaintiffs as follows:
"1MayGentry, four thousand one hundred and sixty-six
dollars and sixty-six cents;
"Olive Lee Gentry, two thousand five hundred dollars;
"Thos. M. Gentry, two thousand five hundred dollars;
"-Mary A. Gentry, one thousand dollars."
Separate judgments were rendered in favor of each plaintiff
for the respective sums awarded by the verdict and for costs,
for which execution was directed to issue.
A motion for a new trial having been made and overruled,
the case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and. by
that court the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed
with costs to the plaintiffs.
It was alleged in the complaint and there was evidence
tending to show (although this evidence was weakened by
that introduced on behalf of the railroad company)That the deceased was an engineer on the regular passenger
train of the defendant running between Big Springs, in Howard County, Texas, and Toyah, in Reeves County, Texas, and
was paid for the number of miles actually run by him as such
engineer;
That he had brought his train into Big Springs from Toyah
about six o'clock on the morning of March 13, 1890, and was
off duty that day, the schedule time for his going on duty
again being twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock in the evening of the day when his train would leave Big Springs for
Toyah;

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

357

Opinion of the Court.

That at fifteen minutes after eight o'clock on that evening
the deceased left his residence for the purpose of going to and
taking charge of his engine;
That his train was standing at its usual and customary place
on a switch on the north side of the defendant's yards at Big
Springs, and in order to reach his engine he was compelled to
pass over and across several switches and the main track;
That while so passing across and over the defendant's
yards, as he and other employ~s had been in the habit of
doing for the previous nine or ten years, along the usual and
customary path, and between the hours of twenty minutes
after eight o'clock and nine o'clock, he was run down and
killed by a fiat car coupled in front of a locomotive used by
the defendant for switching purposes, and while moving
westward on the main track of defendant's road in said
yards ;
That the defendant failed to place any headlight, lantern
or lights of any kind, or any other signal of danger, or any
person to watch for employ~s on said fiat car, to give warning
of its character or to sound a whistle or to ring the bell of the
locomotive as it approached the crossing where the deceased
was struck down;
That the headlight on the locomotive was so arranged that
the rays of light from it passed entirely over and beyond the
flat car in front of such locomotive;
That the defendant failed to have any lanterns or lights of
any kind in or about its yards or along that crossing;
That the engine used by the company for switching purposes on the occasion referred to was an ordinary heavy road
engine with a pilot on in front, and was wholly unsuitable and
unfit for such purposes, and that in order to make it useful the
defendant coupled an ordinary fiat car in front of the engine;
and That the deceased, not knowing of such use of an ordinary
road engine, with a fiat car coupled in front of it, for switching purposes, and while passing along said usual and customary
crossing through the defendant's yards, unable to see the fiat
car on account of the darkness of the night, and being blinded

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

by the headlight on the engine, and not hearing the whistle
or bell of the locomotive, and not knowing anything of the
use and danger of the locomotive and flat car as an appliance
for switching purposes, was run over by the flat car and immediately killed.
The action proceeded on the general ground that the railway company failed in its duty to supply and furnish proper
and suitable machinery for switching purposes, so guarded by
lights and otherwise as to give warning to its employ6s who,
in the discharge of their duties, were compelled to cross the
tracks of the defendant's yards.
At the close of the evidence the company made six requests
for instructions, one of which was that, as the plaintiffs had
failed to prove their case, and had shown no right to recover,
the jury should find for the defendant. These requests were
all denied, and the defendant excepted to the action of the
court in respect of each request.
The court then charged the jury as follows:
"In this case there is no dispute about the following facts:
Louis D. Gentry, on the night of the 13th of March, 1890, was
run over and killed by a flat car of the defendant, propelled
by a switch engine in its yards at Big Springs, Texas; at the
time of his death he was an engineer of defendant, 35 years
old, and earning from $150 to $160 per month; that he left
surviving him his wife, May Gentry, 26 years old, and two
children, Thomas Gentry, now three years old, and Olive Lee,
now seven years old, and his mother, Mary A. Gentry, who is
a widow and to whose support he contributed $15 to $25 per
month; that his mother was about 75 years old at the time of
Louis D. Gentry's death.
"Louis D. Gentry, deceased, assumed the risk naturally incident to crossing the railroad track of defendant at Big
Springs to reach his car or in crossing said track for any
other purpose. You are further instructed that defendant in
switching the cars where said Gentry was killed was not
required to furnish absolutely safe machinery to do switching at that place, but only to use reasonably safe machinery
to do said switching, and if you find from the evidence that

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

359

Opinion of the Court.

the road engine and fiat car used on the occasion when said
Gentry was killed were reasonably safe and were fairly
adapted for switching purposes at Big Springs, then you
will find for defendant.
"If, however, you find from the evidence that said road
engine and fiat car used by the defendant in switching when
said Gentry was killed were not adapted to switching purposes, and that as appliances for that purpose they were
unsafe by reason of the way the light from the headlight
struck the fiat car and track of the road or from other defects
disclosed by the evidence, and that said Gentry's death was
directly occasioned by said defects, without any fault or negligence on his part, then you will find for plaintiffs.
"In considering whether the road engine and fiat car used
on defendant's road at the time said Gentry was killed were
safe or unsafe appliances to be used in switching, your attention is asked to all the evidence Pro and con on that subject,
such as the opinion of the witnesses, the custom of this particular railroad, the effect of attaching fiat cars, the effect of
the engine light in lighting up the fiat car and track, the
effect of the pilot.
"A corporation is liable in damages to its employ6 who is
injured by the use of defective machinery or machinery not
adapted to the purposes for which it is used. The master,
however, is not responsible if the employ6 had full knowledge
of such defect or want of adaptability of the machinery used
to the purpose for which it was used, nor is he liable if deceased contributed by his own neglect to his death.
"Louis D. Gentry was a fellow-servant of the employAs of
defendant operating the switching train that killed him. The
defendant is, therefore, not responsible for any negligence that
caused his death, but if responsible at all, it must be under the
3d and 5th charges above."
At the request of the plaintiffs the court gave this special
instruction: "The law does not exact of an employ6 the use
of diligence in ascertaining defects in the appliances or instruments furnished by a railroad company, but charges him with
knowledge of such only as are open to his observation. Be-

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

yond that he has a right to presume without inquiry or
investigation that his employer has discharged its duty of
furnishing safe and proper instruments and appliances."
The court then instructed the jury, at the request of the
defendant, as follows: "You are further instructed that railway companies are not required to furnish the best and latest
appliances, but the appliances and machinery used by them
in the carrying out of their business must be reasonably safe,
and they are only required to exercise ordinary care to select
and keep their appliances and machinery in safe condition.
By ' ordinary care ' is meant such care as a person of ordinary
prudence would exercise under like circumstances. You are
therefore instructed that if you find and believe from the evidence that the engine and fiat car used for switching purposes
were reasonably safe, and that the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company exercised ordinary care in the selection of the same,
and the injury complained of was not the result of a failure
on the part of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company to
exercise such ordinary care, then you will find for the defendant."
1. The plaintiff Mary A. Gentry, the mother of the deceased, has moved to dismiss the writ of error as to her upon
the ground that, her cause of action being separate and distinct from that of her co-plaintiffs, and a separate judgment
in her favor for only $1000 having been entered in the Circuit Court, this court is without jurisdiction under the sixth
section of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 51T, which declares that
in all cases not by that section made final "there shall be
of right an appeal or writ of error or review of the case by
the Supreme Court of the United States where the matter in
controversy shall exceed one thousand dollars besides costs."
26 Stat. 826.
This motion is overruled. While there was in form a
separate judgment in favor of each of the persons for whose
benefit the action was brought, the statute of Texas creates
a single liability on the part of the defendant, and contemplates but one action for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
surviving husband, wife, children and parents of the persons

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

361

Opinion of the Court.

whose death was caused in any of the specified modes. The
final order in the Circuit Court was, in legal effect, a judgment
for the whole amount of the damages found by the jury.
Such an action as this can be brought by all the parties interested, or by any one of them for the benefit of all. If the
parties entitled to bring suit fail to do so within the time prescribed, it becomes the duty of the personal representative of
the deceased to commence and prosecute it. By whomsoever
brought the jury may give such damages as they think proportioned to "the injury" resulting from the death. It is one
injury for which damages may be recovered, and "the amount"
so recovered is to be "divided" among the persons entitled to
the benefit of the action, or such of them as shall then be alive,
"in such shares" as the jury shall find by their verdict. The
jury found that the damages sustained by the deceased were
$10,166.66. That was the amount in dispute. The "matter
in controversy" was the liability of the defendant company
in that amount by reason of the single injury complained of.
such liability
If the defendant was liable in that sum -and
was fixed upon it by the verdict and final judgment thereon
- it was of no concern to it how that amount was divided
among the parties entitled to sue on account of the single
injury alleged to have been committed.
The case is determined by Shields v. Thom", 17 How.3, 4, 5.
In a proceeding in one of the courts of Kentucky a decree
was rendered against the defendant for a large sum of money,
" the shares of the respective complainants being apportioned
to them in the decree," and the defendant being directed "to
pay to each the specific sum to which he was entitled, as his
proportion of the property misappropriated." A suit was
brought in Iowa to enforce the decree of the Kentucky court,
and the relief asked was a decree that Shields might be compelled to pay to the plaintiffs, respectively, "1the several sums
decreed in their favor." A decree of that kind was rendered.
This court, speaking by Chief Justice Taney, said: "The
whole amount recovered against Shields, in the proceedings
in Iowa, exceeds two thousand dollars. But the sum allotted
to each representative who joined in the bill was less. And

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

the motion is made to dismiss, upon the ground that the sum
due to each complainant is severally and specifically decreed
to him; and that the amount thus decreed is the sum in controversy between each representative and the appellant, and
not the whole amount for which he has been held liable.
And if this view of the matter in controversy be correct, the
sum is undoubtedly below the jurisdiction of the court, and
the appeal must be dismissed. But the court think the matter
in controversy in the Kentucky court was the sum due to the
representatives of the deceased collectively; and not the particular sum to which each was entitled, when the amount due
was distributed among them, according to the laws of the
State. They all claimed under one and the same title. They
had a common and undivided interest in the claim, and it was
perfectly immaterial to the appellant how it was to be shared
among them. He had no controversy with either of them on
that point; and if there was any difficulty as to the proportions in which they were to share, the dispute was among
themselves, and not with him. . . . This being the controversy in Kentucky, the decree of that court, apportioning the
sum recovered among the several representatives, does not
alter its character when renewed in Iowa. So far as the
appellant is concerned, the entire sum found due by the Kentucky court is in dispute. He disputes the validity of that
decree, and denies his obligation to pay any part of the money.
And if the appellees maintain their bill, he will be made liable
to pay the whole amount decreed to them. This is the controversy on his part, and the amount exceeds two thousand
dollars. We think the court, therefore, has jurisdiction on
the appeal."
In Ex arte Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,106 U. S. 5, 6, after
referring to certain cases in which it had been held that when
in admiralty distinct causes of action in favor of distinct parties, growing out of the same transaction, are united in one
suit according to the practice of the courts of that jurisdiction,
distinct decrees in favor of or against distinct parties cannot
be joined to give this court jurisdiction on appeal, it was said:
"The cases of Shields v. Thomas, 17 How. 3; Mfarket Corn-

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

363.

Opinion of the Court.

yany v. Rofma, 101 U. S. 112; and The Connemara, 103
U. S. 754, relied on in support of the present application, stand
on an entirely different principle. There the controversies
were about matters in which the several claimants were interested collectively under a common title. They each had an
undivided interest in the claim, and it was perfectly immaterial to their adversaries how the recovery was shared among
them. If a dispute arose about the division, it would be between the claimants themselves, and not with those against
whom the claim was made. The distinction between the two
classes of cases was clearly stated by Chief Justice Taney in
Shield8 v. Thomas, and that ease was held to be within the
latter class. It may not always be easy to determine the
class to which a particular case belongs, but the rule recognizing the existence of the two classes has been long established."
The rule announced in Shields v. Thomas has been recognized in later cases. Estes v. Gunter, 121 U. S. 183, 185;
Gibson v. Shufeldt, 122 U. S. 27, 33; Clay v. -Field,138 U. S.
464, 479 ; New Orleans Pacafic Railway v. Parker,143 U. S.

42,51.
Another ground of the motion to dismiss is that a decree of
affirmance without specifying the sum for which it is rendered
is not a final decree or judgment from which an appeal or writ
of error will lie. This position is not tenable. For the purpose of a writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals the
judgment of the Circuit Court was final, because it terminated the litigation between the parties. The judgment of
affirmance in the Circuit Court of Appeals involved the same
matter in dispute that was determined by the judgment of
the Circuit Court, and was final for the purposes of a writ
of error to this court. Upon the affirmance in the Circuit
Court of Appeals of the judgment of the Circuit Court, the
latter court would have nothing to do except to execute its
own judgment. And so, upon the affirmance by this court of
the final judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the matters in controversy between the parties are concluded, and
nothing will stand in the way of the execution of the judgment of the Circuit Court.

.361

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

2. On the part of the defendant it is contended that the
plaintiff utterly failed to prove that Gentry was killed by a
flat car coupled in front of a locomotive, as they alleged in
their petition, or that his death was due to any negligence
of the defendant; consequently, that the court should have
directed a verdict for the defendant; that the undisputed facts
of the case not only- did not establish any actionable negligence on the part of the defendant, but, on the contrary,
negatived such negligence; and that the court erred in instructing the jury that there was no dispute as to the cause of
Gentry's death, and in allowing testimony to be introduced on
that assumption.
The court did not err to the prejudice of the defendant, in
saying to the jury that there was no dispute that Gentry was
run over and killed by a flat car of the defendant propelled by
a switch engine in its yards at Big Springs. Although no one
saw the deceased, at the moment of his being run over, yet,
under the evidence, all of which is before us, it was not
possible for the jury to have doubted that the deceased was
killed in the way stated by the court. If the jury had returned a verdict upon the theory that the evidence did not
show that the deceased was killed by being run over by defendant's flat car coupled to one of its engines, it would have
been the duty of the court, on motion, to set aside the verdict
and grant a new trial. The fact of death in that mode was so
clearly established that, if the case had turned alone upon that
point, the court would have been authorized to direct a verdict
for the plaintiffs. We think the court meant nothing more
than that the fact of death being caused in the mode stated
by it was placed by the evidence beyond dispute. If more
was intended; if the court erroneously assumed that the defendant admitted the fact to be as stated, no error was committed to the substantial prejudice of the defendant; for, as
already said, the evidence authorized a peremptory instruction
that Gentry was killed by being run over by a flat car
attached to one of defendant's engines.
Equally untenable is the proposition that the evidence did
not tend to show actionable negligence on the part of the

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

365

Opinion of the Court.

defendant, and that the jury should have been so instructed.
Whether the road engine and flat car used by the defendant
on the occasion of Gentry's death were reasonably safe and
fairly adapted for switching purposes, or were unsafe by
reason of the way in which the light from the headlight on
the engine struck the flat car and track of the road; whether,
if the appliances used by the defendant for switching were
found to be unsafe for such purposes, the deceased had full
knowledge that they were not reasonably adapted to the uses
to which they were put; whether the deceased, by his own
negligence, contributed to his death -these matters were all
submitted to the jury. And they were submitted with the
direction to consider all the evidence in the case, and under
an injunction that the defendant was not responsible for any
negligence on the part of the fellow-servants of Gentry operating the switching train that killed him, and was only
responsible in the event the jury found from all the evidence
on the subject - "such as the opinion of the witnesses, the
custom of this particular road, the effect of attaching flat cars,
the effect of the engine light in lighting up the flat car and
track, the effect of the pilot" - that the switching machinery
or appliances furnished and used by the company were unsafe
to be used. If, looking at all the evidence and drawing such
inferences therefrom as were just and reasonable, the court
could have said, as matter of law, that the plaintiffs were not
entitled to recover, an instruction to find for the defendant
would have been proper. Pleasant v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116,
121 ; Montelair v. Dana, 107 U. S. 162; Randall v. Baltimore
& Ohio Railroad,109 U. S. 478. If the evidence had been so
meagre as not, in law, to justify a verdict for the party upon
whom the burden of proof rested, the court would have been
in the line of duty if it had so instructed the jury. Sparf &
Hansen v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 109. No such course
was proper in this case, which was one peculiarly for the jury
under appropriate instructions as to the principles of law by
which they were to be guided in reaching a conclusion.
3. One of the assignments of error relates to the refusal of
the court to give the .following special instructions asked by

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

the defendant: "You are instructed that it is the duty of an
employ6 or any other party, about to cross a railroad track,
to look and listen for passing engines, cars or trains, to ascertain whether or not same are approaching before going upon
the track, and if the party fails to exercise such care, he cannot recover. You are, therefore, instructed that if the deceased, L. D. Gentry, by looking or listening, could have
known of the approach of the engine and car and in time to
have kept off the track and prevented the injury to himself,
and that he failed to do so, you will find for defendant."
It is undoubtedly true, as claimed by the defendant, that
the deceased was under a duty not to expose himself recklessly when about to cross the track of a railroad. In Railroad Co. v. Iouston, 95 U. S. 697, 702, this court, after referring
to certain acts of negligence upon the part of a railroad company which were alleged to have caused personal injuries, said:
"Negligence of the company's employds in these particulars
was no excuse for negligence on her part. She was bound to
listen and to look before attempting to cross the railroad
track, in order to avoid an approaching train, and not to
walk carelessly into the place of possible danger." To the
same effect are Scholfield v. Chicago, Xtfilwaukee & St. Paul
Railway, 114 U. S. 615, 618, and Aerkfetz v. Humphreye,
145 U. S. 418. But the present case did not admit of or require an instruction upon this special subject. There was no
evidence upon which to rest such an instruction. As already
stated, no one personally witnessed the crossing of the track
by the deceased, nor the running of the flat car over him.
Whether he did or did not stop, and look and listen for approaching trains, the jury could not tell from the evidence.
The presumption is that he did; and if the court had given
the special instructions asked, it would have been necessary to
accompany it with the statement that there was no evidence
upon the point, and that the law presumed that the deceased
did look and listen for coming trains before crossing the
track.
In Continentalimprovement Co. v. Stead, 95 U. S. 161, 164,
the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, upon the subject

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. GENTRY.

367

Opinion of the Court.

of the relative rights and duties of a railroad company and the
owner of a vehicle crossing its track, said : "Those who are
crossing a railroad track are bound to exercise ordinary care
and diligence to ascertain whether a train is approaching.
They have, indeed, the greatest incentives to caution, for their
lives are in imminent danger if collision happen; and hence
it will not be presumed, without evidence, that they do not
exercise proper care." This principle was approved in Baltimore & Ohio Railroadv. Griffith, 159 U. S. 603, 609. Manifestly it was not the duty of the court, when there was no
evidence as to the deceased having or not having looked and
listened for approaching trains before crossing the railroad
track to do more, touching the question of contributory negligence, than it did, namely, instruct the jury generally that the
railroad company was not liable if the deceased by his own
neglect contributed to his death, and that they could not find
for the plaintiffs unless the death of the deceased was directly
caused by unsafe switching appliances used by the defendant,
and without fault or negligence on his part.
The counsel for the defendant in their elaborate brief say:
"Plaintiffs below cannot claim that the headlight of the engine did not illuminate and make plain to any one the fiat car.
They may contend that the headlight blinded the deceased.
If this be true, he knew that switch engines with flit cars
aitached in front and behind them were continuously moving
in and about the yard, and if the light did blind him he knew
then and there the blinding effects thereof, and it was as careless for him to step upon the track just in front of a car as it
would have been for a blind man to have so acted. We submit that if he was blinded by the headlight that he was guilty
of the grossest negligence, being blinded, in walking upon the
track under the existing circumstances. We submit, however,
that the evidence shows without contradiction that, by the
exercise of ordinary care, he could have seen the fiat car. We
submit that a blind man who would attempt to cross the track
just in front of the engine, the puffing and blowing of which
he could hear, hoping to get across the track before the engine
could strike him, would be guilty of the grossest negligence.

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

In this case the deceased was not blind. He could see the
engine with its headlight illuminating fifteen or twenty feet
of the flat car next to the deceased, and lighting up the track
for some distance ahead."
It is sufficient to observe that the evidence touching the
matters referred to by counsel was not so clear and satisfac-

tory as to justify the taking of the case from the jury upon the
issue whether the deceased exercised due care under the circumstances which attended the occasion. It was properly left
to the jury to determine whether, under all the circumstances,
the effect of the headlight and flat car combined was to make
the situation secure and safe to one who saw the headlight,
but did not see the fiat car in front of the locomotive. "What
may be deemed ordinary care in one case," this court has said,
"may, under different surroundings and circumstances, be
gross negligence. The policy of the law has relegated the
determination of such questions to the jury under proper instructions from the court. It is their province to note the
special circumstances and surroundings of each particular case,
and then say whether the conduct of the parties in that case
was such as would be expected of reasonable, prudent men
under a similar state of affairs. When a given state of facts
is such that reasonable men may fairly differ upon the question as to whether there was negligence or not, the determination of the matter is for the jury. It is only where the facts
are such that all reasonable men must draw the same conclusion from them, that the question of negligence is ever considered as one of law for the court." Grand Trunk Rai way
