could only be extinguished by purchase, or by a new arrangement with the United States.
I understand the words "unoccupied lands of the United
States" to refer not only to lands which have not been
patented, but also to those which have not been settled upon,
fenced or otherwise appropriated to private ownership, but I
am quite unable to see how the admission of a Territory into
the Union changes their character from that of unoccupied to
that of occupied lands.

v8.

Kentucky.
To the Honorable .Melville W. Fuller, Chief Jstice of the
&upreme Court of the United State.
The undersigned commissioners appointed by this honorable
court in the above entitled cause, to ascertain and run the
boundary line between the States of Indiana and Kentucky,
north of the tract known as Green River Island, have the
honor to present the following report:
The first meeting of the commission was held at Evansville,
Indiana, on December 7, 1895, all the commissioners being

present, and each commissioner having been sworn according
to the order of the court, the commission organized by electing Lieut. Col. Amos Stickney, U. S. army, as chairman.
At this meeting there were present Mr. R. H. Cunningham, of Henderson, Ky., representing the State of Kentucky;
Mr. Iferril Mfoores, deputy attorney general of the State of
Indiana, representing that State, and Mr. J. E. Williamson, of
Evansville, Indiana, representing a number of land owners
along the line where the boundary is to be ascertained and
run.
The above mentioned gentlemen being invited thereto,
expressed their views in a general way as to a proper method
of determining the boundary line to be run between the
States of Indiana and Kentucky to accord with the decision
of this court. Neither in the order of your honorable court

appointing the commissioners, nor subsequently, were your
commissioners instructed as to the methods they should pursue in ascertaining the boundary line to be run. They therefore assumed that it was the intention of the court to leave
them untrammelled with instructions other than such as were
to be inferred, first, from the decision of the court, and,
second, from the testimony upon which that decision was
made.
Your commissioners then proceeded to and made a personal
examination of the grounds where the boundary line was to
be ascertained and run. After this examination, and a consideration of the subject in the light of the court's decision,
and the testimony, it was concluded that a determination of
a proper location of the boundary line would require the
marking out upon the ground as nearly as possible of
the meandered river bank lines of the survey of Jacob
Fowler, made in 1805 and 1806, the oldest survey of record,
copies of the map and notes of which were incorporated and
unchallenged in the testimony in the case.
A competent surveyor was employed in the person of Mr.
C. C. Genung, surveyor of Vanderburgh County, Indiana, who
was familiar with the county records and the landmarks in
the vicinity of the proposed line. Mr. Genung was instructed
to proceed as soon as possible under the direction of the chairman, to redstablish upon the ground as nearly as practicable
the aforesaid meander line of the survey of 1805 and 1806,
using every precaution to determine said line as accurately as
might be, from the notes of the survey, and such marks referred to in the notes, and other authenticated marks as
might be found.
He was also directed to make cross sections at intervals, by
levelling across the depression now existing, where the island
chute once was, and determine the present crests of the
banks.
Mr. Genung performed the duty allotted to him, and made
a map exhibiting the result of his surveys.
Your commissioners, after verifying his work on the ground,
then held another meeting at Evansville, Indiana, January

INDIANA v. KEY TUCKY.
Decree of the Court.

22nd, 1896, and made a careful study of the information obtained by the survey. An examination of the map presented
by Mr. Genung, giving the results of his survey, with a report
upon the same, satisfied your commissioners on three points.
The close accord of the reestablished meander line with the
existing crest of the high bank was strong proof that the line
as reestablished was in fact a very close approximation in
location to the location of the line as originally run; it also
indicated that the original meander line was practically along
the crest of the high water bank, and not along the low water
line; and further, that the crest of the bank along the Indiana
side of the depression as it exists to-day must be nearly as it
was at the time of the original survey.
It will be noticed from the topography on the map that the
crest of the high water bank on the Indiana side of the depression is quite regular, while the crest of the bank on the
island side, especially above the railroad crossing, is irregular,
indicating probably, extensive deposits since the time when
there was a free flowing stream around the island. In the
testimony there are mentions of drift piles in the upper part
of the chute causing deposits.
Below the railroad crossing the crests of the two banks are
nearly parallel, and as scaled on the map where most nearly
parallel, are about eight chains apart. It would seem probable that the chute before it was choked up by drifts and
deposits had a width more or less uniform of about eight
chains between crests of the high bank. During low water
stages the part of the chute covered by water was probably
nearly in the centre of the chute. Just how far the low water
surface extended towards the Indiana side, it is impossible at
this time to determine accurately, but it would seem that a
close approximation to the water line would be a line equidistant from the Indiana bank crest line and the central line
of the chute. Upon this assumption, the water of a low stage
would have covered the middle half of the space between the
crest of the high banks, and a fair allowance should be made
for the space covered by the bank slopes extending from the
crests of the high banks to the low water line.

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Decree of the Court.

It was decided then, to lay out as a trial line, a line parallel
to the meander line of the survey of 1805 and 1806, as re-established, and at a distance of two chains from it, measured
toward the island. This was done, and notification was sent
to Hon. W. A. Ketcham, attorney general of the State of
Indiana; Mr. R. H. Cunningham, representing the State of
Kentucky, and Mr. J. E. Williamson representing land owners.
The above mentioned gentlemen were invited to present in
writing, if they so desired, any statements to prove that such
line was not approximately the low water line in the year
1792. They were also invited to make any oral argument
welating thereto to your commissioners at their next meeting.
On February 3rd, 1896, your commissioners again met at
Evansville, Indiana, and proceeded to inspect the trial line as
laid out and marked upon the ground. After their inspection
they held a meeting, due notice of which had been given to
the aforementioned gentlemen representing the different
interests.
Mr. IR. I. Cunningham on behalf of the State of Kentucky
appeared, and bad no particular objections to urge against the
.approximate line, but filed a request which is herewith transmitted, marked Exhibit "11A." Mr. J. E. Williamson sent a
-communication, which is transmitted with this report and
marked Exhibit "B."
After further consideration of the subject it was decided
that your commissioners were not authorized to lay down
.any line beyond the upper and lower limits of Green River
Island as it existed in 1792, and it was decided to adopt for
Tecommendation the trial line within those limits as marked,
with a slight change at the extreme upper end, to allow for
what was undoubtedly a fiat bank slope, it being upon a
point.
Your commissioners would therefore respectfully state that
ithey have now ascertained -and run, according to their best
judgment, the boundary line between Indiana and Kentucky,
north of the tract known as Green River Island as it existed
when Kentucky became a State, which is desoribed as follows,
to wit:

The above described line is indicated by the red line on
the map tiansmitted herewith, marked Exhibit "C." We also
transmit the preliminary and final reports of the surveyor,
Mr. 0. C. Genung, marked Exhibits I'D" and " E," also a
sheet of cross sections marked Exhibit "F."
The above described line is now marked by cedar posts, set
at the initial and terminal points, and points where changes
in direction occur, and it is recommended that it should be
permanently marked as follows:

INDIANA v. KENTUCKY
Decree of the Court.

Three suitable points should be selected upon the line, one
near the upper end, one near the middle, and one near the
lower end. At each of these points a monument should be
erected which should consist of a stone of durable quality,
six feet long, and eighteen inches square in cross section.
This stone should be imbedded in a well made foundation
of concrete. The concrete foundation to be six feet square
and four feet deep, the upper surface being at the surface of
the ground. The stone should be placed upright so as to
extend three feet into the concrete, and have three feet above
the ground. Upon one side of the stone should be cut the
word "Indiana," and upon the opposite side the word "Kentucky." Between the stone monuments, at each turning
point of the line, there should be placed an iron post six feet
long, and six inches in diameter of cross section. The iron
post to be imbedded in a foundation of concrete two feet
square, and three and one half feet deep; the top of the
concrete to be at the surface of the ground, and the post
standing upright in the concrete, the top of the post being
three feet above the ground.
The estimated cost of the above described monuments,
including placing the same, is $600.00.
We herewith file as a part of our report, two certified
copies of the original map, which we recommend be furnished the respective States, as may be directed by the
court.
We herewith attach an itemized statement of costs and
expenses incurred by the commissioners, marked Exhibit "Gr,"
which, if approved, we recommend be adjudged equally
against the parties to the suit.

EVANsviLLE, TID., Feb. 2, 1896.
COL. Amos STicmizy, Evansville, Ind.
DEAR Sm: I was shown a sketch, by Capt. Genung, of the.
line as staked off. Capt. Genung said to me that he had a.
letter from you stating that you would be in the city tomorrow, and that the commission would meet to-morrow
night. I am compelled to leave home to-night, and will
probably not be at home for a day or two. Capt. Genungwill explain fully.
The line as staked off in the main will be satisfactory. I
desire to call the attention of the commission to the two
termini. I understand the controlling fact has been the survey of 1806, and the notes of this survey show that stakes
were driven at several points on the bank of the river. If we
take the dividing line between sections 14 and 15 as a sample,
the notes show that a stake was driven on the bank of the
river between the point where the stake was driven and the:

INDIANA v. KENTUCKY.
Decree of the Court.

present bank of the river is a very considerable distance, and
the evidence shows that a great deal of land has been made
by accretion opposite the mouth of Green River. If we take
an east and west line, or say the northern boundary line of
section 14 and measure off the full length of the east side we
have the distance shown by the stake driven. If we were to
go one section still further east, a point which nobody has
ever claimed was reached by Green River Island, we will
have exactly the same thing, a stake on the bank of the Ohio
River, and I assume the same notes would show stakes on the
Ohio River up to the Ohio line. It does not follow therefore
that all the land that has been made south of these stakes is
in Kentucky. The same thing holds good at the lower end of
the line. Only sixty days ago I passed on an abstract of title
for a tract of land belonging to the Smiths immediately down
the river from the present site owned by the city for its water
works. We commenced on a line back from the river and the
calls in the deed were so many feet to the Ohio River, when
we measured for the number of feet, we found that it did not
reach the Ohio River by one hundred or two hundred feet. I
thought at first there was a mistake in the deed, but when we
came to ascertain the facts more definitely, it was learned that
the difference in feet was accounted for by the accretion. I
am confident that the same will hold at many other points
along the river. It seems, therefore, to me that we cannot
rely on calls of the survey of 1806 to locate the upper and
lower ends of the island, as there have been accretions at
both points.
Yours respectfully,
J. E. WILL=Axso.

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with your instructions I have
regstablished the sectional and meander lines of fractional
sections, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16 and a part of 14 T. 7 S., R. 10 W., and
also a part of section 31, T. 6 S., R. 10 W. following the notes
of the original United States surveys as made by Jacob Fowler
VOL. CLX--84

in 1805 and 1806, as closely as possible. I found, however,
that his work had not been very carefully nor accurately done,
his lines not having all been run with the same variation, nor
his distances always accurately chained.
I first sought to locate his original corners, the posts set by
him having long since disappeared. I found a mulberry stub
standing on the line between sections 15 and 16, and 16.23
chains south of the northwest corner of sec. 15, which is an
original witness tree, as noted by him. At the termination of
the section line between sections 5 and 6 a maple tree witnessed by him has been standing, up to about one year ago,
but the stump, now five feet in diameter, with witness marks
on it, is still there. Each of these points so located are also
points on the meander line, and the surveyor's records in my
office, as well as oral testimony of the old inhabitants, go to
show beyond question that these are corners established by
Mr. Fowler.
In 1856 A. T. Whittlesey, who was surveyor of Vanderburgh County, regstablished the northwest corner of sec. 14,
putting down a cypress post, which he afterwards replaced
by a stone, which now marks the corner. One of the original
witness trees was then standing. At the same time he reestablished a point on this line between sections 14 and 15 and
40 chains south of the northwest corner of sec. 14, by a cedar
post which is still standing. At that point one of the original
witness trees was then standing. The distance was by close
measurement 39.91 chains. This line produced south from
said northwest corner of sec. 14 64.25 chains, the distance
given by Mr. Fowler, fixes its termination and also a point on
the meander line. The variation is 2 ° 30.
The northeast corner of sec. 16 was fe~stablished by A. T.
Whittlesey, surveyor of Yanderburgh County, in 1856. The
box elder witness tree noted by Mr. Fowler was standing at
that time. From that corner running west 29.67 chains the
distance given by Mr. Fowler, gives the termination of the
section line between sections 9 and 16, which is also a point
on the meander line. The northeast corner of sec. 16 is also
16.23 chains north of the corner by the mulberry stub, this

INDIANA v. KENTUCKY.
Decree of the Court.

being the distance given by Mr. Fowler, and has a variation
of 30 40.

At the northwest corner of sec. 9, J. Lindsley, surveYor of
Vanderburgh County, in 1837, set a white oak post to re~stablish the corner, the original witness trees being then standing.
In 1855 0. G. Olinstead, surveyor of Vanderburgh County,
replaced the oak post by a mulberry post, and in 1874 this
was replaced by a limestone, set by August Pfafflin, surveyor
of Vanderburgh County, which stone is still there. Commencing at that point and running south 49.84 chains, the distance
given by Mr. Fowler, I found the termination of the line
between sections 8 and 9, which is also a point on the meander
line.

This variation is 3° 30'.

Running west from the northwest corner of section 9, 58.00
chains, the distance given by Mr. Fowler, gives the termination of the line between sections 5 and 8, and also a point on
the meander line.
The southwest corner of sec. 32, T. 6 S., R. 10 W. 1 established from two old monuments, one at the northwest corner,
and the other at the southeast corner of said section. This
line between the southeast and southwest corners had a variation of 2° 50'. From this corner so established, I ran south
51.72 chains to a post near the maple stump, original witness
tree, Mr. Fowler giving the distance as 51.50 chains. This
line had a variation of 30 00', and its termination is also a
point on the meander line. From the southwest corner of
sec. 32 I ran west 25.70 chains, the distance given by Mr.
Fowler, which is the termination of the line between section
31, T. 6 S., R. 10 W., and section 6, T. 7 S., IR. 10 W., and
also a point on the meander line.
In this way I found seven points which are as closely absolutely correct as it is possible to locate them after a lapse ot
ninety years. Primarily fixed points, if correct, must govern
as against distances or compass variations, secondly, distances,
and lastly, courses. Upon this basis I ran the meander line,
following Mr. Fowler's notes as closely as possible, and making
such corrections as were necessary. It was impossible to follow them exactly, for the reasons already stated, that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.

compass variations on the lines between section corners established by Mr. Fowler vary from one to two degrees, and in
only one instance has a line the correct variation, and in 28
distances given by him, which I remeasured, 12 of them varied
from two to seventy-four links each.
The following are the field-notes for the meander line:

EXHIBIT

" E."

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners, on the Indiana
and Kentucky Boundary Line at Green River Island.
GENTLmXEN: The line of the low water mark of 1792, from
the head to the foot of Green River Island, has been located
as ordered by you, and the commencement, terminus and each
intermediate angle marked by planting a cedar post five inches
square and seven feet in length in the ground to the depth of
four and one half feet. The line is, except at the commencement and ending, two chains (132 feet) to the left of the
meander line going down stream, and parallel thereto. The
angles, checked by the needle, were taken twice, and each
distance carefully measured twice to avoid the possibility of
errors. The line is laid down on the map marked "Exhibit
0 " in red ink, and the distances are given in feet. The true
meridian was obtained by observation of Polaris on two different nights.
The following are the notes of the location:
Commencing at a. point on the line between sections fifteen
(15) and fourteen (14), township seven (7) south, range ten (10)
west, and 67.25 chains south of the northeast corner of section
