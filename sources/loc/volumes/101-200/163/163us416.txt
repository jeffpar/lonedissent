MR. JusTcE PzoxHnM delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a petition for a rehearing of some of the questions
heretofore decided in these cases. A decision was rendered in
them a short time ago, and a portion of the judgment in each
case was reversed, and the cases remanded to the Supreme
Court of Tennessee for further proceedings therein. 161 U. S.
134. Application is now made on the part of the defendants
in error in each case for a rehearing of the same upon the
question of the jurisdiction of this court to review the decision
of the state court in regard to the exemption from taxation of
the so called new stock, being stock that was issued since the
adoption of the constitution of 1870. Leave was given both
parties to submit briefs upon the question of jurisdiction, as
also upon the merits of the question sought to be reviewed.

BANK OF COMMERCE v. TENESSEE.
Opinion of the Court.

Such briefs have been received, and we proceed to decide the
question.
The bank was chartered in 1856 under the name of the
Chattanooga Savings Institution, which name was subsequently changed to the Bank of Commerce, and its place
of business moved to Memphis. In the charter was contained
the following clause: "Said institution shall have a lien on
the stock for debts due it by the stockholders before and in
preference to other creditors, except the State for taxes, and
shall pay to the State an annual tax of one half of one per
cent on each share of the capital stock, which shall be in lieu
of all other taxes." On the day of the adoption of the new
constitution, May 5, 1870, the capital stock of this institution
was $200,000. The second section of the charter contains
this provision: "The capital stock of said company shall be
divided into shares of $50 each, and when 200 shares have
been subscribed and the sum of one dollar per share paid
therein, the shareholders may meet and elect five directors."
By section 4 it is provided that "it may receive on deposit
any and all sums not less than one dollar per week offered as
stock deposits; . . . and when such deposits amount to $50

it may at the option of the depositor become stock in the
institution."
It appears that on sundry days prior to June 1, 1887, the
capital stock of the bank had been regularly increased under
this provision in its charter to $600,000, and on the 17th of
March, 1890, and on sundry days prior to June 1, 1890, it was
again regularly increased to $1,000,000. There was no maximum capital fixed in the charter. In 1870, while the capital
stock of the bank stood at $200,000, the new constitution of
the Stae was adopted, which provided for the taxation of all
property, which provision would iniciude the shares issued since
1870, if they are not protected by the exemption clause in the
charter above quoted.
These suits were brought by the defendants in error against
the bank and the shareholders for the purpose of recovering
the amount of taxes which had been assessed for several years
then last past against the parties defendant, the bank and the

shareholders. In the actions it was sought to recover either
against the bank on its capital stock or against the shareholders by virtue of their ownership of the shares of the capital stock. It was not contended that both were liable to pay
the tax, but that one or the other should be held liable. A
single stockholder was chosen to represent the stockholders
generally, and he was one of the holders of what may be
termed the new shares -that is, shares issued since the adoption of the constitution of 1870. This was done under an
arrangement between the parties so that all the stockholders
need not be made parties to the action.
The answer of the plaintiffs in error, the bank and the stockholders, claimed a total exemption from all taxation, both on
the part of the bank and shareholders excepting the tax provided for in the charter. Thus the claim of the State was
that the bank or all the shareholders were taxable under the
provisions of the general tax laws of the State, and it left it to
the court to say which were thus taxable. But the State also
claimed that if the old shares of stock were not taxable, the
new shares issued after 1870 were taxable, as they came into
existence after the constitution provided for the taxation of
all property, and they were not subject to the exemption
clause contained in the charter of the bank. So the question
submitted to the state court was, which of these two classes
shall be taxed; or, if the old shareholders are not to be taxed,
can the new shareholders be taxed. The Supreme Court of
the State held that all the shareholders, both old and new,
were proper subjects of taxation; that the exemption clause
in the charter did not apply to either, but it applied to the
capital stock of the bank, and judgment was therefore decreed
for a recovery against all the shareholders of both old and
new stock for taxes assessed under the general taxation laws
of the State. In the course of the opinion delivered by one
of the learned judges of the state court, which was concurred
in by the majority, it was stated that there was no difference
between the rights of the shareholders of the old and the new
stock with'reference to the right of exemption from taxation
under the charter clause ; that if the old shares were exempt

BANK OF COMMERCE v. TENNESSEE.
Opinion of the Court.

tho new shares were also exempt, and that the contract covered both classes of stock in the same way and to the same
extent; but the judgment of the court was that neither class
of stockholders was exempt from taxation on account of the
shares of stock held by it, that the exemption clause applied entirely to the capital stock, and that hence the shares
of stock were liable to taxation under the general laws of the
State, and judgment was ordered against all the shareholders,
both of the old and the new stock accordingly. Judgment at
the same time went in favor of the bank decreeing its exemption from taxation under those laws of the State.
The bank and the shareholders through Mr. Omberg, their
representative, sued out a writ of error from this court, and
the judgment of the state court was thereby brought here for
review. The claims of the parties upon that writ of error
were on the part of the plaintiffs in error that the whole judgment of the state court was wrong; that neither the shareholders of the old nor of the new stock were liable to pay any
amount of taxes other than the tax provided for in the charter, and that the same exemption applied to the bank. The
defendants in error claimed that the whole judgment of the
state court was right; that all the shareholders were properly
assessed, but that if this were not so and the holders of old
shares were exempt by reason of the clause in the charter,
such clause did not apply to the holders of the new shares of
stock, and that they were liable in any event, and that, therefore, the judgment as against such new shareholders was right,
and to that extent the judgment should be affirmed, even if it
should be reversed as to the holders of the old shares of stock.
This court held that, as to the holders of the old shares, the
judgment was wrong, as the exemption in the charter applied
to the holders of the shares of stock and not to the capital
stock itself. Concerning the further question whether the
judgment was right as against the holders of the new shares
of stock, the court held that it would not review the decision of
the state court on that question; that as the state court had
granted the exemption claimed by the holders of the new
shares by virtue of the contract clause in the charter, this

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

court had no jurisdiction to review that decision, and, therefore, refused to do so. The whole judgment against all the
stockholders, both of the new as well as of the old shares of
stock, was reversed. In coming to that conclusion and in
reversing the whole judgment we think this court inadvertently fell into error. The error consisted in mistaking a certain statement in a portion of the opinion of the court below
for the judgment which it actually rendered. Instead of
granting the exemption the court refused it entirely, and
the judgment which it actually rendered was against all the
shareholders alike, both of the old and of the new shares, but
in the opinion the court stated that no difference existed
between the holders of the old as compared with those of the
new shares of stock, and that the holders of the new shares
were entitled to the exemption from the tax to the same
extent that the holders of the old shares were, but, as the
court determined, neither the old nor the new shareholders
were entitled to such exemption.
The material matter in the case was the judgment, and the
judgment was against all the shareholders, so when that judgment was brought before this court by writ of error on the
part of the shareholders, the question for this court was to
determine whether or not there was error in that judgment.
In the determination of that question no effect can be given
the opinion of the state court in favor of the plaintiffs in
error upon one ground, so long as it is rendered entirely immaterial by the judgment of that court against the plaintiffs in
error upon another ground. It is our duty to look at the
whole judgment as it comes before us, and if any portion of
it be correct and is so stated as to be separable from and independent of the other portion which we find to be erroneous,
it is our duty to affirm that portion in which we find no error
and reverse that portion which we decide to be wrong. Therefore we think it is our duty to examine the question whether
the judgment brought here for review is not right as against
the holders of the new shares on the ground that they were not
included in the charter clause providing for exemption from
taxation, because their stock was issued since the constitution

BANK OF COMMERCE v. TENNESSEE.
Opinion of the Court.

of 1870 was adopted. Even if the opinions of the state court
were a part of the record, as is claimed by counsel for the
plaintiffs in error, no different result would follow on that
account. Being a part of the record merely gives the court a
right to look into these opinions for the purpose of discovering the ground upon which the judgment of the court actually
proceeded. Looking at them we find, as reasons for the
judgment of the state court against all the shareholders, that
the exemption clause of the charter applied to the capital
stock of the bank and not to the shareholders in any event.
Looking further into the opinion we find the added statement
that if the exemption clause had applied to the holders of the
old shares it would equally have applied to the holders of the
new, as they were both situated alike, and if one class were
entitled to exemption the other was also. That opinion upon
the latter subject is an abstract one, upon which no judgment
was entered, because the state court held that neither class
was entitled to exemption and directed judgment against
them all. Under these circumstances it seems plain to us that
in refusing to look into the question whether the judgment,
so far as it affected the holders of the new shares only, was
right or wrong, we failed to exercise our appropriate jurisdiction, and it is our duty, upon the questioii being now brought
to our attention, to retrace our steps and examine the question and determine for ourselves whether that portion of the
judgment of the state court enforcing taxation of the holders
of the new shares of stock ought not to be upheld although
for a different reason than that which controlled the action of
that court.
The case of .furdock v. City of.MnempAis, 20 Wall. 590, and
other similar cases are not in point. The purpose of examining to see whether there is not some question other than a
Federal one, decided in the case, is to 8ustain thereon the
judgment under review. In this case the plaintiffs in error
are not seeking a question of local law upon which to sutain
the judgment against them. If we find the Federal questions
properly decided as to one class of persons affected by the
judgment we must sustain that part of it, although we come

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

to that conclusion for a different reason from that expressed
by the state court, and one which upon that point is in conflict with its opinion but not with its judgment. So in the
case suggested by counsel, of separate actions against the
stockholders and the bank, and a decision by the state court
that the holders of the new shares were exempt under the
contract clause. Of course, no decision of that kind could be
reviewed here because the claim was allowed by the state
court, and judgment went in his favor. To make it parallel
with this, the court should have held the holder of the new
shares liable and entered judgment against him, while stating
in its opinion that if the holders of old shares had been exempt
he would have been also exempt, but as they were not, neither
was he. Upon his writ of error to this court we could say
that the judgment was right, because although the holders of
the old shares were exempt, yet the holders of the new shares
did not stand in the same position, and they were not exempt.
The judgment would be upheld although for a different
reason.
We come then to the merits of the subject. In determining
the question whether the state court was right in adjudging
the holders of the new shares of stock liable to assessment by
reason of their ownership of that stock, (no matter for what
reason such determination was reached,) it is necessary to see
what the provisions of the charter were in relation to this increase of capital stock. We see by the second section above
quoted that no limitation was therein prescribed of the amount
of capital stock of the bank, and the provision for the increase of the capital stock, as mentioned in section 4 of the
charter, makes the depositor the person who is to decide
whether the stock shall be increased or not, for by that section the depositor when depositing his moneys as a stock depositor in the bank has himself the option when the deposit
amounts to $50 or more to call for and to have scrip for stock
issued to him therefor. By this provision it cannot be claimed
that the State entered into such a contract with future depositors who might choose to demand stock for their deposits,
that the provision relating thereto could not be changed by

the legislature. It was a provision in relation to one of the
general powers of the corporation to issue stock which might
be changed from time to time as the legislature in its discretion might think proper, so long as no vested right of property
accruing prior to the legislative amendment was unfavorably
affected thereby. We think there was no vested right on the
part of the future depositor to make a stock deposit, and claim
the issuing of a similar amount of stock to him, which a legislature could not cut off. If before making any such deposit
the legislature altered that provision in the charter and prohibited any such kind of deposit thereafter, we think it clear
that no vested right of a future depositor was thereby interfered with. We have held that the clause in the charter of
this bank providing for taxation amounted to a contract that
the shares of stock in the hands of the shareholders should be
exempt from further taxation than that which is provided in
the charter. Is the language in the charter to be extended to
the shares of stock issued subsequently to the adoption of the
constitution of 1870? In other words, does the contract obligation attach to and form a part of the stock so issued to the
same extent as if the stock had been issued prior to 1870?
We are inclined to think not. Full effect can be given to the
charter by confining it to the shares of stock that might be
issued under its provisions so long as the constitution of the
State was not altered or a provision thereof adopted providing
for the taxation of such property. Applying the rule which
is always applied by this court in such cases, that the claim
for exemption must rest upon language in regard to which
there can be no doubt as to its meaning, and that the exemption must be granted in terms too plain to be mistaken, the
claim for exemption for this subsequently issued stock cannot
be maintained. This rule for the construction of exemption
from taxation clauses in acts of the legislature is referred to
in the opinion in Pcn&Fire & .MarineInsurance Co. v.
Tennessee, one of these cases and decided at the same time.
161 U. S. 174.
It is true there is an unlimited right to increase the capital
stock of this bank under the fourth clause in question, but

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

it must be done in a certain way. The bank has no right
separate and apart from the depositor to increase its stock,
and the depositor's right is based upon his depositing the
money in the bank as a stock depositor and calling for an
issue of stock when it amounts to $50, or over, for the
-amount of such deposit. We think that the legislature might
prohibit the further issue of capital stock in this corporation
under this section. By the enactment of the charter there
was no contract therein to forever continue this power to
deposit and make such deposits a claim for stock therefor.
There is no such language in terms, and none should be
implied. It amounted to nothing more than a legislative
license, which might be availed of by any depositor, but
which the legislature might at any time revoke by thereafter prohibiting the issuing of stock in return for deposits.
If the legislature could thus absolutely prohibit the further
issuing of stock, could it not also provide that no stock
should be thereafter issued unless subject to taxation as
other property in the State? We see no reason to doubt
the legislative capacity in that respect. Of course, the adoption of a constitutional provision of the same nature would
be subject to the same rule. We do not see that by the
adoption of the constitution of Tennessee in 1870, which
provided for the taxation of all property, any contract obligation was impaired so far as regards the rights of the
bank or the owners of the shares of stock issued subsequent
to the adoption of the constitution. The constitution impaired no obligation of an existing contract. It prevented
the subsequent making of one. No depositor could claim a
contract or any vested right to make a deposit under the
provision of section 4 of the act, and then claim an exemption from taxation of such stock where the deposit was
made and the stock issued after the adoption of the constitution of 1870.
In Pearsallv. Great _Northern Railway Go., 161 U. S. 646,
we held that a clause in a charter of a railroad corporation
granting it certain powers to consolidate with or become the
owner of other railroads was not such a vested right that it

BANK OF COMMERCE v. TENNESSEE.
Opinion of the Court.'

could not be rendered inoperative by a subsequent statute
passed before the company had availed itself of this power
granted it by a former statute. We held that the power so
conferred, so long as it was unexecuted, was within the control of the legislature and might be treated as a license, and
be revoked by the legislature if it so chose. Much of the
reasoning of that case is applicable here. We think the
power of the legislature to alter the terms upon which stock
might be subscribed is more clear than was its power in the
case of Fearmall,8upra. We assume in this case the legislative power to grant an unlimited right to increase the capital
stock of the bank. That is a question of the power of the
legislature of the State, and the decision of the state court
in regard to the power of the legislature in such a case is one
which we follow. Admitting the right to grant such power,
it does not follow that it may not be taken away by a subsequent legislature, and if when the stock is issued there is a
provision in force in the State for the taxation of all property, we do not think the clause providing for the exemption
of the stock applies to such stock thus issued.
It is urged that this right to issue stock in exchange for
deposits is a valuable franchise of the bank given to it by this
charter, accepted by it, and held as a contract secure from. any
assault by state legislation. We do not think that it is thus
secured, because we are of opinion that it is not of that contractual nature which the Federal Constitution prevents any
impairment of by state legislation. As has been seen by
reference to the above case of Pearall v. Railway Co., all
provisions in a charter granting rights or powers to a corporation do not partake of the nature of a contract, which
cannot for that reason be in any respect altered or the power
recalled by subsequent legislation. Where no act is done
under the provision and no vested right is acquired prior to
the time when it was repealed, the provision may be validly
recalled, without thereby impairing the obligation of a contract. The power to issue stock in return for deposits is of
that kind which we think is subject to legislative power of
repeal or of regulation so long as the action of the legisla-

426

Opinion of the Court.

ture interferes with no rights which have become vested before the passage of the act. Many cases bearing upon this
subject are to be found cited in the arguments of counsel
and in the opinion of this court in the Pearsall case, and
it is unnecessary for us to further elaborate the question.
Having the power to repeal altogether the grant to issue
stock upon the making of stock deposits, as above stated,
we think the power to permit it to be issued subject to
taxation would be within the power of the legislature. This
is in substance the effect of the constitution of 1870 providing for the taxation of all property. The clause of exemption no longer applies to shares of stock thereafter issued.
We think, therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Tennessee adjudging a recovery against the shareholders
of the new stock issued since 1870 was, to that extent, correct, and our former decision, which reversed the whole judgment of the state court as against the shareholders, must be
amended.
The mandate wiZ be recalZed; so much of the judgment of
the state court as permits a recovery against the hoZder
of the old shares of stock in the bank is reversed; the judgment so far as it permits a recovery for taxes assessed
against the weders of the new shares in the bank is affirmed, and the cases remanded to the state court for further proceedings not inconsistent woit this opinion; and
it is so ordered.
