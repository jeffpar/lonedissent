On the 19th of June, 1891, an entry was made of record that the court
"allows a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States, with
stay of execution, upon the fling of a supersedeas bond." Such bond

cases dependent upon diverse citizenship was taken away March 3, 1891,
except as to pending cases and cases wherein the writ of error or
appeal should be sued out or taken before July 1, 1891. In this case
the petition for the writ and the assignment of errors were filed in the

to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, Ield, that the writ was not suad out
or taken before July 1, 1891, and that it must be dismissed.

THIS was a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, as the
jurisdiction of the court below depended solely upon the diverse citizenship of the parties, and the writ of error was not
sued out until July 3, 1891. By the act of March 3, 1891, (26
Stat. 826, c. 517,) establishing the Circuit Courts of Appeals,
the jurisdiction of the court, in cases dependent upon diverse
citizenship, was taken away; but by the joint resolution of
March 3, 1891, (26 Stat. 1115,) the jurisdiction was preserved
as to pending cases, and cases wherein the writ of error or
appeal should be sued out or taken before July 1, 1891. The
language.of the joint resolution of March 3,1891, (26 Stat.
1115,) is as follows: "And be it further resolved: That
nothing in said act shall be held or construed in any wise to
impair the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or any Oircuit
Court of the United States in any case now pending before it,
or in respect of any case wherein the writ of error or the appeal shall have been sued out or taken to any of said courts
before the first day of July, anno Doinini eighteen hundred
and ninety-one."

of error to this court with stay of execution upon the filing of
a supersedeas bond, and that a supersedeas bond was filed on
