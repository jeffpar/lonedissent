DASHIELL v. GROSVENOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 569. Argued January9, 10, 1896. -Decided

April 18, 1896.

The first claim in letters patent No. 425,584, issued April 15, 1890, to Samuel Seabury for an improvement in breech-loading cannon, viz. : for
"The combination, with a breech-loading cannon and a breech-block for
the same, which is withdrawn in a rearward direction, of a breech-block
carrier hinged to the breech, and a breech-block retractor hinged to the
breech separate from said carrier to move independently of said carrier
to draw the breech-block thereinto ad push it therefrom,'but capable
of moving the said carrier while the breech-block is therein, substantially as set forth;" must, in view of the state of the art at the time of
the invention, be limited to the precise mechanism employed: and, being
thus limited, it is not infringed by the device patented to Robert B.
Dashiell by letters patent No: 468,331, dated February 9, 1892.

THIS was a bill in equity by the appellees against Dashiell
for the infringement of letters-patent No. 425,584, issued
April 15, 1890, to Samuel Seabury, a lieutenant in the United
States Navy, for an improvement in breech-loading cannon.
In his specification the patentee made the following statement
of his invention:
"This improvement relates to breech-loading cannon in
which a screw breech-block, which is withdrawn in a rearward direction, is employed, with a swing carrier or receiver
hinged to one side of the breech of the gun, and into which the
breech-block is withdrawn, and which serves as a guide for

directing the breech-block into and from its seat in the breech
and as a support for the breech-block while out of the gun.
In such a gun there are three movements necessary to open
the breech - namely, first, the turning of the breech-block
to unlock it; second, the withdrawal of the breech-block
backward into the receiver; and, third, the swing aside of
the receiver with the breech-block in it. These three movements have hitherto been separately performed by hand, the
breech-block having been first turned to unlock it by hand
and then pulled by hand back into the receiver, and the receiver having been then swung aside by hand with the breechblock in it to open the breech.
"The object of this improvement is to provide for the more
rapid working, loading and firing of such breech-loading cannon by effecting all these movements in succession by a continuous movement of a single lever."
The plaintiff relied only upon the first claim of the patent,
which reads as follows:
"1. The combination, with a breech-loading cannon and a
breech-block for the same, which is withdrawn in a rearward
direction, of a breech-block carrier hinged to the breech, and
a breech-block retractor hinged to the breech separate from
said carrier to move independently of said carrier to draw the
breech-block 'thereinto and push it therefrom, but-capable of
moving the said carrier while the breech-block is therein, substantiallv as set forth."
The plaintiffs were Seabury, the patentee, and certain others,
who were assignees of interests under the patent. The'defendant was, when the suit was begun, an ensign iji the United States
Navy, and the infringing acts were admitted to have been done
under his authority and procurement, under a contract between
himself and the Navy Department, through which he was to
be paid a stipulated sum for each gun manufactured, embodying the infringing device. For this device letters patent No.
468,331 had been issued to him February 9, 1892.
Upon a hearing, upon pleadings and proofs, the Circuit
Court was of the opinion that the Seabury patent was valid,
and the Dashiell patent an infringement thereon, and it entered
a decree to that effect. 62 Fed. Rep. 584.

DASHIELL v. G-ROSVENOR.
Opinion of the Court.

On appeal to the Court of Appeals, that court was of opinion that an injunction would prohibit the officers in charge of
the navy yard from manufacturing guns for use upon the war
vessels of the United States, and for that reason ought not to
be granted. The bill of complaint also relied upon certain
allegations of fraud which the court held were material to be
proved, and were not sustained; and for those reasons it reversed the decree of the court below and dismissed the bill.

MR. JusTic . B:EOwN, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

The question of infringement in this case turns largely upon
the construction to be given to the first claim of the Seabury
patent. If, as set forth in his specification, he is entitled to
claim broadly, by the continuous operation of a single lever,
the performance of the three movements necessary to open
the breech of a breech-loading gun, viz., unlocking the breechblock, pulling it back into the receiver, and swinging it to one
side, the Dashiell patent, which effects the same movements in
substantially the same way, would probably be an infringement. It is claimed that, prior to the Seabury patent, those
three movements were separately made by hand, and that the
novelty of his invention consists in their successive performance
by the single sweep of a lever.
To ascertain whether he is entitled to this broad claim, it is
necessary to consider somewhat at length the state of the art
at the'time the Seabury patent was issued. In modern war-

fare breech-loading guns have largely supplanted the old
muzzle-loading patterns, and the skill of the inventor has been
applied to perfecting the mechanism, whereby the breech may
be effectually closed, to prevent the escape of gas, and at the
same time rapidly and easily opened and thrown back for the
reception of another cartridge. Various forms of breech-block
are used, but the patent in suit relates to what is known as
the mutilated or slotted screw form, which consists of a circular plug of metal, with equal parts of' its threads cut away.
The interior surface of the breech or bore is also fitted with a
corresponding screw, equal parts of which are also cut away.
When the block is in the gun in position for firing, the screw
of the breech-block is interlocked with the corresponding
threads in the interior of the gun, so that the breech-block is
held so firmly to the gun itself as to be substantially a solid
body of metal. After firing, the breech-block is turned
partly around, so that the threads of the screw are released
and brought opposite the smooth portion of the bore. This
admits of the breech-block being withdrawn from the gun,
where it rests upon what is known as the carrier, which is
hinged to the breech and swung to one side, to leave the bore
free for the reception. of another cartridge. Formerly the
three movements of turning the block, withdrawing it from
the chamber, and swinging it to one side, had been separately performed by hand. Was Seabury the first to effect
these three movements by the single and continuous operation of a lever?
John 1. Schenkl purported to do this in the patent issued to
him August 16, 1853, performing the movements " through the
intervention of- appropriate cams, catches and springs, by the
motion of a single lever, worked by the hand of a gunner."
The movement of the lever was not continuous, and the gun
was of a different class, opening in the middle of its length,
tipping up its breech and receiving the cartridge at the muzzle
of its rear section, like the ordinary muzzle loader. The lever
is necessarily given a backward and forward motion to support
the two portions of the gun, and turn the breech portion upward, and the same lever is also given another backward and

Opinion of the Court.

forward motion, to again connect the two portions of the gun
together. Obviously it is not an anticipation.
The patent to Cochran, of November, 1859, throws no light
upon the question in this case. The same may be said of the
patent to Goodwin of May, 1864. While the patent to Driggs
and Schroeder of April 5, 1887, shows a decided advance in
the method of breech loading, there is nothing in the invention to indicate that the patentee had in mind the peculiar
features claimed for the Seabury patent. The English patent
to Farcot, a French engineer, issued the same day as the
Driggs and Schroeder patent, relates to an apparatus so
arranged that, by the rotation of a single axis, the successive
movements necessary for introducing or withdrawing the
breech-block are performed with ease, rapidity and exactness.
Mechanical means are utilized to operate the breech-block in
all three of its movements, for opening as well as closing,
and all of them are performed through a crank handle. Its
appearance marks a step in advance in the development of
the breech mechanism, and the accomplishment of the three
motions in one.
British patent No. 9813 to Albert Sauv6e, issued May 4,
1888, also exhibits mechanical gearing for operating a slotted
screw breech-block, by a continuous movement in a given
direction. In this patent the rotation of the breech-screw,
its extraction and the rotation of the carrier succeed each
other, while the hand-crank is being turned in the same
direction. The breech is closed by working the handle in
the opposite direction.
The British patent to Sauv~e of July 4, 1887, No. 9453,
also discloses a breech mechanism for operating a slotted
screw-breech block, giving all the~three necessary movements
of rotation, retraction and swinging aside, by the continuous
movement of a simple hand lever. The breech-block in
this patent is of conical form and not cylindrical, as in the
other patents. The general arrangement shows a lever attached to the breech-block near its middle, and connecting
with the carrier by means of a fulcrum, so that power applied
to the end of the lever will cause the breech-block to move

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

forward and backward in the carrier, and into and out of
the gun. Besides this, the necessary gear-wheels are fitted
to provide necessary rotation to the block at the proper time.
When the block is fully withdrawn upon the carrier, the
latter is swung to one side by the continued motion of the
same lever.
British patent No. 7435, granted February 12, 1889, to
Canet, also described, in the first claim, "an improved construction, whereby the opening of the breech of guns can be
effected completely by a rotary movement always in the same
direction, the rotation of the breech-screw being effected by
the action of a rack mounted upon an endless screw, upon a
toothed sector on the breech-block; the longitudinal movement of the breech-screw being effected by the direct action
of a pinion upon the threads of the breech-screw; and the
pivoting of the bracket being effected by the direct action of
the operating shaft upon the endless vertical screw."
Still another system, in which the three motions required
of the breech-block are accomplished by a single movement
of a lever, is found in the British patent No. 7195 to Nordenfeldt, May 17, 1887. In its general principle of effecting
these movements, it bears a closer resemblance to the Seabury patent than any other exhibit. "The invention," says
the patentee, "relates to breech-loading guns in which the
breech is closed by a block entering the breech opening, and
having spaced screw-threads upon it engaging corresponding
spaced screw-threads, within the breech of the gun. In such
guns I give all the necessary movements to the breech-block
by means of a lever handle and axis rotating through the arc
of a circle. The same movement also actuates an extractor
and gives the necessary movement to it for withdrawing the
cartridge case from the chamber of the gun."
The patentee Nordenfeldt thus describes the operation of
his device:
"In opening the breech, as soon as the lever handle is moved
sufficiently far to disengage the screw-threads, a shoulder
upon or moving with the lever handle comes against another
shoulder upon the withdrawing arm, and this then commences

DASHIELL v. GROSVENOR.
Opinion of the Court.

to turn with the hand lever moving rearwards from the breech
of the gun. In this movement it draws backthd breech-block
out of the gun, the breech-block being engaged with the disengaging arm in the manner already described. In this way
the breech-block is landed upon the tray or support, and, as
soon as this is the case, the tray or support also commences to
move round with the lever handle carrying the breech-block
to the rear, and at the same time conveying it to one side so
as to leave the breech opening unobstructed. In closing the
breech the same movements take place in reversed order.
First, all the parts move together, whilst the breech-block is
brought back into position to enter the breech opening, then
the tray or support remains stationary whilst the breech-block
is thrust from off it by the withdrawing arm, and finally this
arm remains at rest during the last part of the movement of
the lver handle, whilst the rotary movement is imparted to
the breech-block requisite to cause the -engagement of the
screw-threads."
The lever in that patent is entirely separate from the carrier, and moves independently of it, except -when the breechblock is fully supported by the carrier, at which time it moves
with the latter. The breech-block is rotated by a rack sliding
on the face on the breech of the gun, connecting with an arm
or projection on the driving shaft. A.large model of the
breech mechanism of .this patent, made from the drawings at
the NavyDepartment, was put in evidence, with written directions for. working it'
It is claimed by the plaintiffs in this connection that the
model of the Nordenfeldt patent, so made and exhibited, is
inoperative, and hence cannot be said to be an anticipation of
the first claim of the Seabury patent; and such seems to have
been the view of the learned judge who delivered the opinion
of the Circuit C.ourt. It does not clearly appear, however,
whether this inoperativeness is due to a fault in the original
construction of the machine, or to a slight defect in the model
made from the drawings in the Navy Department. This
model was constructed largely of wood, and might very possibly have become so worn by experimental use, as to fail to

Opinion of the Court.

perform perfectly all its functions. It does not seem probable
that the patentee would have taken out a patent for a wholly
inoperative combination, especially in view of the fact that
there were at least half a dozen operative devices already in
existence upon which his was claimed to be an improvement.
Inoperative devices are frequently set up as anticipations, but
they are usually such as have proven to be so far failures
that the inventor has not taken out patents for them, and are
resuscitated for the purpose of showing that other machines
similar to the one patented have been invented before. *The
very fact that a ntchine is patented, is some evidence of its
operativeness, as well as of its utility, and where a model is
construdted after the design shown in a patent which is not
perfectly operative, but can be made so by a slight alteration,
the inference is, that there was an error in working out the
drawings, and not that the patentee deliberately took out a
patent for an inoperative device.
But, however this may be, it isclear that the model in question could be made operative by a very trifling alteration, increasing the friction between the bolt and the guideway in
the withdrawing arm. Either the filling piece was made a
little too small or else it had become worn by constant use of
the model. That this was simply a question of friction was
readily demonstrated by slipping a thin piece of paper between the filling piece and the bottom of the guideway, when
the device appeared to be fully operative. The conclusion is
irresistible that the alleged inoperativeness was not one due to
any inherent defect in the mechanism described in the patent,
but to a want of exactness in the model, due either to imperfect construction, or to the employment of another material
than was contemplated in the patent.
As several of the patents above described show that, at the
date of the Seabury invention, it was no longer a novelty to
perform the three movements necessary to open and close the
breech by the continuous movement of a single lever, it fol-

lows that the first claim of this patent cannot receive the
broad construction'claimed, but must be limited to the precise
mechanism described. This is for a cdmbination, 1. Of a

DASHIELL v. GROSVENOR.
Opinion of the Court.

breech-loading cannon and a breech-block capable of being
withdrawn in a rearward direction from the gun. 2. A
breech-block carrier hinged to the breech. 3. A breech-block
retractor hinged to the breech separate from its carrier. 4.
That the retractor shall move independently of the carrier, to
withdraw the breedh-block thereinto and push it therefrom.
5. And that it shall be capable of moving with the carrier,
while the breech-block is therein.
It may be doubtful whether, in view of the Nordenfeldt
patent; there is any novelty even in the exact combination
described in this claim, since in both cases there is a vertical
axial bolt or pivot hinged to the breech of the gun; a crank
arm secured to this bolt and operating the rack; a retractor
arm permanently secured to the breech-block and hinged to
the breech separate from the carrier, and moved independently of it; a carrier hinged to the breech-block, the carrier
and retractor being capable of moving together, while the
breech-block is on the carrier; the movement being transmitted from the retractor to the carrier through the breechblock. But whether the Nordenfeldt device be an exact
anticipation or not, the Dashiell device differs from the
Seabury patent much more than the latter differs from the
Nordenfeldt machine, since the retractor of the Dashiell device
is not hinged to the breech at all, but is hinged to the carrier;
and is not separate from the carrier, but is a part of it, and
when the carrier moves, the retractor also moves. In the
Seabury device the carrier and retractor move independently
ofeach other; but as the claim says, they are separate from
each other, whereas in the Dashiell device they are so intimately connected that when the carrier moves, the retractor
moves with it. It is true that the retractor, though hinged
to the carrier when turning on its pivot, acts as it would if
it were, hinged to the breech; yet, Seabury having restricted
himself to a retractor hinged to the breech separate from the
carrier, in view of the state of the art, which appears to have
been much- more advanced than the plaintiffs are willing to
concede, we think such difference is material. As before observed, in the Dashiell device the retractor is not hinged to

Opinion of the Court.

the breech, but to the carrier, and it is not worked independently of it, but in connection with it.
The truth is that, at the time the Seabury patent was taken
out, the scope for invention was much more limited than Seabury apparently supposed. The mutilated form of screwblock, apparently a French device, had been in use for many
years. Of course the use of this block implied some method
of withdrawing it from the gun, swinging it to one side and
returning it to the bore. To accomplish this several devices
were invented, most of them employing a swinging lever, a
carrier and a retractor. In some cases, as in the Canet patent,
a toothed rack was used to rotate the" breech-block, and in
others- a cam, and in two or three of these patents these movements were accomplished by the continued operation of a lever.
Nothing, in fact, was left to the ingenuity of the inventor but
to devise new variations upon this combination,, and, in our
opinion, DashielPs device is as great a departure from Seabury's
as the latter is from the devices which preceded it.
We are, therefore, of opinion that, under the construction
we are compelled to give the first claim of the Seabury patent,
the Dashiell device is not an infringement.
This conclusion also renders it unnecessary for us to consider the questions discussed by the Court of Appeals in its
opinion, in respect to one of which see Balknap v. Sckild, 161
U. S 10; but for the reasons stated, its decree, dismissing the
bill, is
Affirmed.
