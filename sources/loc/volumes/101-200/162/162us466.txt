WALLACE v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF KANSAS.
No. 781.

Submitted March 2, 1896.-Decided April 20, 1896.

W. lived on a tract of land next to one owned and occupied by his father in
law Z., concerning the boundary between which there was a dispute between them. While V. was ploughing his laud, Z., being then under the
influence of liquor, entered upon the disputed tract and brought a quantity of posts there, for the purpose of erecting a fence on the line which
he claimed. W. ordered him off, and continued his ploughing. He did
not leave, and W. after reaching his boundary with the plough, unhitched
his horses and put them in the barn. In about half an hour he returned
with a gun, and an altercation ensued, in the course of which W. was
stabbed by a son of Z. and Z. was killed by a shot from W.'s gun. W. was
indicted for murder. On the trial evidence was offered in defence, and
excluded, of threats of Z. to kill W.; and WV.himself was put upon the
stand and, after stating that he did not feel safe without some protection
against Z., and that Z. had made a hostile demonstration against him, was
asked, from that demonstration what he believed Z. was about to do ?
This question was ruled out. Held, that if W. believed and had reasonable ground for the belief that he was in imminent danger of death or
great bodily harm from Z. at the moment he fired, and would not have
fired but for such belief, and if that belief, founded on reasonable ground,
might in any view the jury could properly take of the circumstances
surrounding the killing, have excused his act or reduced the crime from
murder to manslaughter, then the evidence in respect of Z.'s threats was
relevant and it was error to exclude it ; and it was also error to refuse
to allow the question to be put to W. as to his belief based on the demonstration on Z.'s part to which he testified.

WALLACE v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.
Where a difficulty is intentionally brought on for the purpose of killing the
deceased" the fact of imminent danger to the accused constitutes no defence-; but where the accpsed 'embarks in a quarrel with no felonious
intent, or malice, or premdditated purpose of doing bodily harm or killing, and under reasonable belief of imminent .danger he inflicts a fatal
wound, it is not murder.
JERRY Wallace was convicted, at the May term, 1895, of the
District Court of the United States for the District of Kansas,
of the mfirder of Alexander Zane, on March 7, 1895, at the
Wyandotte Indian reservation, and sentenced to be hanged.
The evidence tended to show that Wallace had lived on
that reservation, for four years, on a piece of land owned by
his wife, Jane, a daughter of Alexander Zane, to whom he
was married in 1891. Ill feeling had for a long time existed
between Zane and Wallace, growing out of a dispute between
them as .tothe true boundary line of the land owned or claimed
by Jane Wallace, and on which she resided, and the land of
Julia, a minor daughter of Alexander Zane. Surveys had
been made and patents had issued, but the true boundary line,
if established by the surveys, had not been accepted by the
parties. March 7, 1895, about seven o'clock in the morning,
Alexander Zane, accompanied by his son, Noah, who was
about fifteen years of age, and three other parties, proceeded
with two wagons loaded with posts from his farm to the land
on which Wallace resided, and entered the field occupied by
Wallace, which he was at that moment engaged in ploughing,
through a gap in the fence made by Alexander Zane, and
wentacross it to the fence on the eastern side, and there began
-to unload the posts and to plant or drive them into the ground
along the fence line which, they proposed to establish. Wallace and one Denmark were engaged-in ploughing the field,
being in different parts and moving in opposite directions.
As Zane and his .party entered the field and were crossing it,
Wallace was ploughing towards its eastern side, which he had
reached, and was returning when Zane and his party passed
about fifty or sixty yards from him, moving in a southeasterly.
course. Wallace had impaired eyesight and did not see Zane
until just before he passed, and then called to him saying,

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Statement of the Case.

"Alexander Zane, if that is you, take your force and get out

of this field," or, as it was put by one or more of the witnesses,
" Alexander Zane, I want you to take your mob and get off
these premises." There was evidence tending to show that
Zane and those who were with him had been drinking, and
that they were boisterous, singing and hallooing. Defendant
testified: "They were noisy, hollering and singing, and actiig as if they were drunk to me, and I guess no doubt was."
Zane appears to have made no reply to Wallace, but went on
his way. Wallace continued on with his plough until he had
reached a ravine that ran north and south through the field,
where he halted, unhitched his horses from the plough and took
them up to the barn. In about half an hour he returned with
a double barrelled shotgun in his hands, passed within a few feet
of a group of persons consisting of Denmark, his daughter,
one Lewis, and Wallace's wife, and in passing said to his wife,
"Now Janie, I want you to order these gentlemen out of
here." Mrs. Wallace then ordered Alexander Zane and those
Who were with him to leave, but they paid no attention to
her. Thereupon Wallace ordered Zane to leave and said to
him, "Are you going? " Zane was standing with his right
hand on a post he had driven in the ground and his left arm
hanging by his side.
Wallace testified: "I asked of him whether he was going
or not, and about this time I was struck in the back, and A1r.
Zane made a grab like this (indicating), and he was standing
with his right hand on the post; about the time I was struck
in the back he made this motion (indicating), and says, ' Damn
you, I will kill you;' and then my wife hollers or least she
says, 'Look out, Jerry ' and I fired this. gun."
Lafayette Lewis, another witness, testified: "His wife
ordered them out, and Jerry also, and he asked Zane if he
was going to go,. but I never heard Zane say a word, and
then he told him the second time, and he looked up towards
him, with his left hand on the post, and threw his hand up
this way (indicating) and said, ' Damn you, I am going to kill

Statement of the Case.

way to his bosom and said, ' Damn you, I will kill you!' and
at that moment the boy struck Jerry with the knife and Jerry
shot him."
Several other witnesses did not see or bear any word or
gesture proceed from Zane, but testified that when Wallace
said to Zane, "Are you going?" he immediately raised his
gun, aimed it at Zane and fired, shooting )Zane in .the left
breast; that Zane walked off about thirty feet and fell, and
when those nearest him reached him he was dead; that when
Wallace fired his gun at Zane, Noah Zane ran up and stabbed
him in the shoulder with a pocket knife, whereupon Wallace
turned and pointed his gun at Noah and the gun snapped.
When Zane fell, Noah went to him, and took from his person
a tomahawk or small hatchet, which was the only thing inthe way of a weapon found on him.
There was evidence to the effect that the wound thus. inflicted on Wallace. penetrated about half an inch, bled considerably, was much swollen, and that his stomach was black
and blue as though he had been hit with something, as he
testified that he was.
Evidence was also adduced that Zane was in the habit of
carrying a butcher knife with him in his belt; that he was
quarrelsome; and that Wallace hadmthe reputation of being a
peaceable and quiet man. In reference to the survey under
which 'Zane claimed, testimony was given tending to show, as
was contended, that Zane caused the disputed line to be so
run by the chainmen as to gain four feet, and that Zane said
"when he got through with the land he Wouldn't leave Jerry
Wallace a garden spot;, that he could haul it'away in a wagon
box."
Defendant offered to prove by R. 0. Patterson that the day
'before the shooting occurred he had a conversation with Zane,
"in which Zane .said to him that he was going down there to
build a fence across this property of Wallace's the next day,
and if Jerry Wallace fooled with him he would kill the blind
son of a bitch." This was objected to, the objection sustained
and defendant excepted. Also, that in the same conversation
Zane stated that he had got some. whiskey "for the purpose of

bracing himself up for the purpose of building this fence
across the land of this defendant, Jerry Wallace." Plaintiff
objected, the court sustained the objection and defendant
excepted.
Defendant further offered to prove by Charles Luke that
he had a conversation with Zane the day before the killing,
and "Alex. Zane said to this witness that he was going do'wn
to build a fence across Wallace's land, and that if Jerry Wallace interfered with him he would kill him, or shoot the
blind son of a bitch," and that all these threats were commu-.
nicated to Wallace. Plaintiff objected, the objection was sustained and defendant excepted.
Defendant offered to prove by Mrs. Alice Sargent that
somewhere near the middle of February, 1895, she had a conversation with Zane, on which occasion "Alex. Zane said to
this woman and threatened that he would kill Jerry Wallace,
and that he had a knife that he was carrying at that time for
that purpose, and that these threats were communicated to
Jerry Wallace by this witness afterwards." This was objected
to, the objection sustained and defendant excepted.. A similar
offer of proof by one Taylor was made and a similar exception
taken. Defendant also offered to prove by Samuel Collins
"that at a time shortly before the 7th of March last he met
Alexander Zane and had a conversation with Alexander Zane
about Jerry Wallace, and that in that conversation he threatened to kill Jerry Wallace, and that he said to this witness
that he at one time made him look down the muzzle of a
double barrelled shotgun and he wished he had killed him at
that time, and that these threats were communicated to the
defendant." An offer to prove similar threats prior to the
homicide by Mary Crow was made5 excluded and exception
taken.
When the defendant was on the stand he testified that h
took the gun into the field because he was afraid of the party,
and especially of Alexander Zane, and did not feel safe without some protection. The following questions were put and
ruling made: "Q. You may state, Mr. Wallace, what Zane
did at that time, just before you fired the shot. A. He just

took his hand something like this (indicating) saying, ' Damn
you, I will kill you.' Q. You may state to the jury from that
demonstration what you believed Zane was about to, do.'
To
this question plaintiff objected,. the objection was sustained
and defendant excep'ted.
Various errors were assigned in respect of the jurisdiction
of the court; the sufficiency of the indictment; .the want,-of
due service of the list of jurors; and instructions given and
refused.
.A&. John D. Hill and Mr'. James Hf. Pratt for plaintiff in'
error.
.Mr. Solicitor General for defendants in error.
MR. CHF JusTicE FULLER, after stftting the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
If Jerry Wallace believed and had reasonable grouhd for
the belief that he was in imminent .danger of death or great
bodily harm from Zane at the moment he fired, and would
not have fired but for such belief, and if that belief, founded
on reasonable ground, might in any view the jury could properly take of the circumstances surrounding the killing, have
excused his act or reduced the crime from murder to manslaughter, then the evidence in respect of Zane's threats was
relevant and it was -error to exclude it; and it was also error
to refuse to allow the question to be put to Wallace as to his
belief based on the demonstration on Zane's part to which be
testified.
Where a difficulty is intentionally brought on for the purpose of killing the deceased, the fact of .imminent, danger to
the accused constitutes no defnce;' but where the accused
embarks in a quarrel with no felonious intent, or malice, or
ptemeditated purpose of doing-bodily harm or killing, and
under reasonable belief of imminent danger he inflicts a fatal
wound, it is not murder. Whart. Hom. § 197; 2 Bish. Cr. L.

low, 90 Missouri 608; Adams v. People, 47 Illinois, 376; State
v. fHays, 23 Missouri, 2S7; State v. AtJDonnell, 32 Vermont,
491; Reed v. State, 11 Tex. App. 509.
In Adams v. People, it was ruled by the Supreme Court of
Illinois, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Breese, that where
the accused sought a difficulty with the deceased for the purpose of killing him, and in the fight did kill him, in pursuance
of his malicious intention, he would be guilty of murder, but
if the jury found that the accused voluntarily got into the
difficulty or fight with the deceased, not intending to kill at
the time, but not declining further fighting before the mortal
blow was struck by him, and finally drew his knife and with
it killed the deceased, the accused would be guilty of manslaughter, although the cutting and killing were done in order
to prevent an assault upon him by the deceased or to prevent
the deceased from getting the advantage in the fight.
In Reed v. State, the Court of Appeals of Texas, in treating
of the subject of self defence, said: "It may be divided into
two general classes, to wit, perfect and imperfect right of self
defence. A perfect right of self defence can only obtain and
avail where the party pleading it acted from necessity, and
was wholly free from wrong or blame in occasioning or producing the necessity which required his action. If, however,
he was in the wrong- if he was himself violating or in the
act of violating the law -and on account of his own wrong
was placed in a situation wherein it became necessary for
-him to defend himself against an attack made upon himself,
which was superinduced or created by his own wrong, then
the law justly limits his right of self defence, and regulates it
according to the magnitude of his own wrong. Such a state
of case may be said to illustrate and determine what in law
.would be denominated the imperfect right of self defence.
Whenever a party by his own wrongful act produces a condition of things wherein it becomes necessary for his own
safety that he should take, life or do serious bodily harm,
then indeed the law wisely imputes to him his own wrong
and its consequences, to the extent that they may and should
be considered in determining the grade of offence, which

.
but for such acts would never have been occasioned.
How far and to what extent he will be excused or excusable in law must depend upon the nature and character of
the act he was committing, and which produced the necessity
that he should defend himself. When his own original act
was in violation of law, then the law takes that fact into
consideration in limiting his right of defence and resistance
whilst in the perpetration of such unlawful act. If he was
engaged in the commission of a felony, and, to prevent its
commission, the party seeing it or about to be injured
thereby makes a violent assault upon him, calculated to
produce death or serious bodily harm, and in resisting such
attack he slays his assailant, the law would impute the
original wrong to the homicide and make it murder. But
if the original wrong was or would have been a misdemeanor, then the homicide growing out of or occasioned
by it, though in self defence from any'- assault made upon
him, would be manslaughter under the law."
After quoting from these and other cases, Sherwood, J.,
delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri in
State v. Partlow, remarked: "Indeed, the assertion of the
doctrine that one who begins a quarrel or brings on a difficulty with the felonious purpose to kill the person assaulted,
and accomplishing such purpose, is guilty of "murder, and
cannot avail himself of the doctrine of self defence, carries
with it, in its very bosom, the inevitable corollary, that if
the quarrel be begun without a felonious purpose; then the
homicidal act will not be murder. To deny this obvious
deduction is equivalent to the anomalous assertion that there
can be'a felony without a felonious intent;, that the act done
characterizes the intent, and not the intent the act."
In this case it is evident that Wallace was bent as far
as practicable on defending his possession against what he
regarded and the evidence on his behalf tended to show was
an unwarrantable invasion. But a person cannot repel a
mere trespass on his land by the taking of life, or proceed

Opinion of the Court.

death accidentally ensues, the killing will not exceed manslaughter, but when a deadly weapon is employed it may be
murder or manslaughter, according to the circumstances. 1

8 California, 341; Carroll v. State, 23 Alabama, 28; 1 Whart.
C. L. § 462, and cases cited.
Whether the killing with a deadly weapon may be reduced
in any case to manslaughter when it is the result of passion
excited by a trespass with force to property, we need not
consider, as the question, perhaps in view of the interval of
time during which Wallace was seeking his gun, does not
seem to have been raised. Conceding, though without intimating any opinion on the facts disclosed, that Jerry Wallace
committed a crime, still the inquiry arose as to the grade of
the offence, and, in respect of that, the threats offered to be
proven had an important, and it might be decisive bearing,
nor was the mere fact that Wallace procured the gun as
stated in itself sufficient ground for their exclusion.
In Courko v. United States, 153 U. S. 183, this court held
that it was error to instruct a 'jury that preparation by
arming, although for self defence only, could not be followed, in any case, by manslaughter, if the killing after
.such arming was not, in fact, necessarily in self defence; and
that if, under the circumstances on the occasion of the
killing, the crime were that of manslaughter, it was not
converted into murder by reason of the accused having
previously armed himself.
In Beard v. United States, 158 U. S. 550, 563, it was said:
"In our opinion, the court below erred in holding that the
accused, while on his premises, outside of his dwelling-house,
was under a legal duty to get out of the way, if he could, of
his assailant, who, according to one view of the evidence, had
threatened to kill the defendant, in execution of that purpose
had armed himself with a deadly weapon, with, that weapon
concealed upon his person went to the defendant's premises,
despite the warning of the latter to keep away, and by word
and act indicated his purpose to attack the accused. The de-

fendant was where he had a right to be, when thB deceased
advanced upon him in a threatening manner, and with a
deadly weapon; and if the accused did not provoke the
assault and had at the time reasonable grounds to believe,
and in good faith believed, that the deceased intended to
take his life or to do him great bodily harm, he was not
"obliged to retreat, nor to consider whether he could safely
retreat, but was entitled to stand his ground and meet any
attack made upon him with a deadly weapon, in such way
and with such force as, under all the circumstances, he, at
the moment, honestly believed, and had reasonable -grounds
to believe, was necessary to save his own life or to protect
himself from.great bodily. injury."
In Allison v. United States, 160 U. S. 203, it was held that
in charging the jury on a capital trial in respect of the possession of a deadly weapon by the accused, it was error to
ignore evidence indicating that such possession was for an
innocent purpose. The subject of threats was there somewhat considered and authorities -cited.
Necessarily it must frequently happen that particular circumstances qualify the character of the offence, and it is
thoroughly settled. that it is for the jury to determine what
effect shall be given to circumstances having that tendency
whenever made to appear in the evidence.
In Stevenson v. United States, 162 U. S. 313, we said:
"The evidence as to manslaughter need not be uncontradicted or in any way conclusive upon the question; so long as
there is some evidence upon the subject, the proper weight to
be given it is for the jury to determine. If there were any
evidence which tended to show such a state of facts as might
bring the crime within the grade of manslaughter, it then
became a proper question for the jury to say whether the
evidence were true and whether it showed that the crime
was manslaughter instead of murder. . . . The evidence
might appear to the court to be simply overwhelming to show
that the-killing was in fact murder and not manslaughter, or
an act performed in self defence, and yet, so long -as there
was some evidence relevant to the issue of manslauglter, ,the

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

credibility and force of such evidence must be for the jury,
and cannot be matter of law for the decision of the court.
"By section 1035 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States it is enacted that 'in all criminal causes the defendant
may be found guilty of any offence, the commission of which
is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the
indictment, or may be found guilty of an attempt to commit
the offence so charged: Provided,That each attempt be itself
a separate offence.' Under this statute a defendant charged
in the indictment with the crime of murder may be found
guilty of a lower grade of crime, viz., manslaughter. There
must, of course, be some evidence which tends to bear upon
that issue. The jury would not be justified in finding a verdict of manslaughter if there were no evidence upon which to
base such a finding, and in that event the court would have
the right to instruct the jury to that effect. Sparf v. United
States, 156 U. S.51. . . . Manslaughter at common law
was defined to be the unlawful and felonious killing of another without any malice, either express or implied. Whart.
Am. Or. L. (8th ed.) sec. 304. Whether there be what is
termed express malice or only implied malice, the proof to show
either is of the same nature, viz., the circumstances leading up
to and surrounding the killing. The definition of the crime
given by section 5341 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States is substantially the same. The proof of homicide, as
necessarily involving malice, must show the facts under which
the killing was effected, and from the whole facts and circumstances surrounding the killing the jury infers malice or its
absence. Malice in connection with the crime of killing is
but another name for a certain condition of a man's heart or
mind, and as no one can look into the heart or mind of another, the only way to decide upon its condition at the time
of a killing is to infer it from the surrounding facts, and that
inference is one of fact for a jury. The presence or absence
of this malice or mental condition marks the, boundary which
separates the two crimes of murder and manslaughter."
Treating the excluded evidence as admitted, and assuming
that Wallace would have testified that he believed from Zane's

WALLACE v. U-NITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

demonstration that Zane intended to kill him, the evidence
on defendant's behalf tended t9 establish bad feeling between
Zane and Wallace in reference to the line between Mrs.
Wallace's land and that of Julia Zane;: an attempt on Zane's
part to include a part of Mrs. Wallace's land in the Zane parcel; declarations by Zane the day before the homicide that
he was going the next day to run a fence acr6ss what Wallace
claimed to be his land, and threats that, if Wallace interfered
with him in so doing, Zane would kill hiin, all communicated
to Wallace before the homicide; previous threats'also communicated that he would kill Wallace; forcible entrance by
Zane, acconipanied by several others, into the field claimed
by Wallace, in which he was ploughing, and fencing off part
of it commenced; boisterous and disorderly manifestations on
their part and refusals by Zane to leave when ordered to go
such demonstrations by Zane at the moment as induced Wallace to believe that he was in imminent danger, and action based
on that belief. Granting that the jury would have been justified in finding that Wallace's intention in going for the gun
and returning with it'as he did was to inflict bodily harm on
Zane if he did not leave, still the presumption was not an
irrebuttable one, and it was for the jury to say whether Wallace's statement that he procured the gun only for self protection was or was not true. And if they believed from the
evidence that this was true, and that the killing was under
reasonable apprehension bf imminent peril, then it was for
the jury to determine under all the facts and circumstances
whether Wallace had committed the offence of manslaughter,
rather than that of murder, if he could not be excused
altogether.
We think that the threats were admissible in evidence, and,
this being so, that the question as to Wallace's belief should
not have been excluded. It has been often decided that
where the intent is a material question, the accused may
testify in his own behalf as to what his intent was in doing
the act. People v. Baker, 96 N-: Y. 340; State v. Banks, 73
Missouri, 592; Thurston v. Cornell, 38 IN. Y. 281; Over v.
Schifling, 102 Indiana, 191; People v. Quick, 51 Michigan,

547; Fenwick v. Maryland, 63 Maryland, 239. In the latter
case-it was held that a person on trial for an assault with
intent to commit murder is competent to testify as to the
purpose for which he procured the instrument with which he
committed the assault.
This rule is not controverted, but it is contended that
Wallace's belief was immaterial. For the reasons given we
cannot concur in that view and are of opinion that the witness
should have been allowed to answer.
It is unnecessary to pass upon any of the other points raised
on behalf of plaintiff in error.

C.AMPBELL v. PORTER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE *DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 187. Argued Mfarch 10, 11, 1896. -Decided

April 20, 1S96.

A writ of error is the proper form .ofbringing up to this court an order of
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia admitting a will to
probate.
Since the act of July 9, 1888, c. 597, as before that act, the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia has no power to admit a will or. codicil to
probate as a devise of real estate.

THIS was a petition by the executors of the will of the late
Admiral David D. Porter, who died February 13, 1891, to
the special term of the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia, sitting as an orphans' court, for the admission to
probate of his will and of a codicil thereto.
Upon citation to the next of kin; Elena Porter, a daughter
of the testator, having become by marriage Elena Campbell,
appeared and demanded full proof of the execution of the
will and codicil.
The will and the codicil each bore the signature of the
testator, and those of the same three persons as witnesses.
