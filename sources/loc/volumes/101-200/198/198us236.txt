EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

L. A. KINSEY COMPANY v. BOARD OF TRADE OF
THE CITY OF CHICAGO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 224, 280. Argued April 20, 24,25, I905.--Delded May 8,190.
The Clhcago Board of Trade collects at its own. expense quotations of prices
offered and accepted for wheat, cor and provisions in its exchange and
distributes them under contract to persons approved by it and under
certain conditions. In a suit brought by it to restrain parties from using
the quotations obtained and used without authority of the Board, defendants contended that as the Board of Trade permitted, and the quotations related to, transactions for the pretended buying of gram without
any intention of actually receiving, delivering or paying for the same,
that the Board violated the Illinois bucket -shop statute and there were
no property rights in the quotations which the court could protect, and
that the giving out of the quotations to certain persons makes them free
to all. Held, that
Even if such pretended buying and selling is permitted by the Board of
Trade it is entitled to have its collection of quotations protected by the
law, and to keep the work which it has done to itself, nof does it lose
its property rights in the quotations by'communicating them to certain
persons, even though many, in confidential and contractual relations

to itself, and strangers to the trust may be restrained from obtaining
and using the. quotations by inducing a breach of the trust.
A collection of information, otherwise entitled to protection, 'loes not cease
to be so because it concerns illegal acts, and statistics of crime are property
to the same extent as other statistics, even if collected by a criminal who
furnishes some of the data.
Contracts under wich the Board of Trade furnishes telegraph companies
with its quotations, which it could refrain from communicating at all,
on condition that they will only be distributed to persons in contractual
relations with, and approved by, the Board, and not to what are known
as bucket shops, are not void and against public policy as being in restraint of trade eitherat common law or under the Anti-Trust Act of
July 2, 1890.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr Henry S. Robinns for petitioner in No. 224 and respondent in No.-280"
It is not a good defense -to these suits that most of the transactions, out of which the quotations arise are gambling transactions. The violation by a plaintiff of a criminal statute of
one State does not debar hun from maintaining suits to
protect his property in a Federal court m another State.
Penal laws do not reach, in their effect, beyond the junsdiction of where- they are established. Commonwealth v Green,

Petitioner's misconduct, if any, respecting the transactions

to be highly beneficial to legitimate commerce. Respondents'
answer so admits. So the -Illinois Supreme Court has also
held. Stock Exchange v. Board of Trade, 127 Illinois, 153.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Argument for Board of Trade.

198 U. S.

The Board ,of Trade's conduct with respect to the 'quotations, is not at all reprehensible. It gives them to all persons
desiring them for lawful purposes, and only withholds them,
as it lawfully may, from bucket shops.
As to the Illinois bucket shop law, see Soby v People, 134
Illinois, 66. It does not apply to exchanges.
Market news, whose diisemmation is helpful to commerce,
is not to be deemed infected with illegality or beyond judicial
protection, because the owner of this news maintains an
exchange, where parties to most of the transactons it records
do not contemplate actual delivery The existence of a property right in news depends upon its source, rather than the
character or utility of the news itself. Brooks v Martin, 2
Wall. 79; Planters' Bank v Unwn Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 499.
As matter of fact it is not 'true that most of the trades,
whose prices these quotations record, are gambling transactions.
As to the principle and legality of the systems of offsetting
or elimination of trades winch will be foumd in most commercial exchanges, see Clews v Jamieson, 182 U. S. 461,
Lehman v Feld, 37 Fed. Rep. 852, Irwin v. Williar, 110 U. S.
499; Bibb v Allen, 110 U S. 500.
The Board of Trade should not be held responsible for -what
gambling there is upon its exchange, and on that account be
deprived of its right to sue to protect its property in its. quo"tations.
There is a property right in the quotations which equity
will protect by injunction.
Both in England and this country market news thus distributed as are these quotations, is a species of property,
which a court of equity will protect by injunction. Exchange

The anti-bucket shop acts were m force when the Sherman.
Act was passed. They promote.- public welfare. They were
passed in the exercise of. the Sts.te's police power. Doubtless
that power must yield, when, necessary, to the paramount
power of Congress to regulate commerce, but this court should
noT, in. the absence of clear language, assume that Congress
intended by this act to nullify these state statutes, if indeed
it. lawfully might do so. Sherlock v Ailing, 93 U.- S 99;

The quotations are not property and cannot be impressed
with a right of property by the Board of Trade. Sayre v.

Fed. Cas. No. 13,514, and cases cited by counsel for Board
of Trade.
The Board of Trade has no property right or interest
in or to the knowledge of the quotations, as they arise from
the transactions of its members on the exchange.,. Cases cited
supra and Keene v Wheatley, Fed. Cas. No. 7644..
The right of property to mental or literary effort rests
fundamentally upon- the creative faculty which must have
been exercised by the claimant or one through whom his
title is derived.
Nothing can be the object of property-which has not a
corporeal sulstance. Wheaton v Peters, 8 Pet. 591, nor be
the object of property which is not capable of sole and exclusive enjoyment. Milar v Taytcr, 4 Burr, 2361, 2 Kent's
Com. 320"; Webster; Bouvier, sub. "Property", Schouler's
Personal Property, ยง2; 1 Blackstone, 138, Jones v Van
Zandts, 4 McLean, 603. To be property it must be capable
of distinguishable proprietary marks. Jefferys v Boosey, 4
H. L. Cas. 869. The Board of Trade cannot.alter the essential nature of the quotations. Its sole right of property is
confined to the records themselves.
It has no property interest in quotations made up of transactions on its floor when the transactions are not based upon
bona fide contracts of purchase and sale of the commodity
dealt in. The cases 14 127 Illinois and 103, 109 and 119 Fed.
Rep., cited by counsel for the Board, are not determinative
of tis case.
The transactions on which the quotations arq based are so

tainted with illegality that the Board cannot have a property
right in them.

As to the illegality of transactions, where there is no intention of delivery of the commodity bought and sold, see Counselman v Rewhert, 103 Iowa, 430; First Nat. Bank v Oskaloosa Co., 66 Iowa, 41. As to methods of the Board of Trade
see Central Stock Exchange v Board of Trade, 196 Illinois,
396, Higgzns v McCrea, 116 U. S. 671. The testimony shows
that no deliveries are intended in ninety five per cent of the
transactions. The members of the Board occupy the relation
of bucket shops to their customers and tile Board is a bucket
shop to the non-members. As to substitution of trade see
Clews v Jameson, 182 U. S. 461, 471.

The Board realizes the full avails of its property when it
sells the quotations to the telegraph companies and the delivery to those companies is necessarily a publication to the
world. Bryant v West. Un. Tel. Co., 17 Fed. Rep. 825, is
not applicable, the distinction between restricted and general
publication does not extend to matter of this kind. Pierce

MR. JUSTICE HOLMEs delivered the opirion of the court.
These are two bills in equity brought by the Chicago Board
of Trade to enjoin the principal defendants from using and
distributing the continuous quotations of prices on sales of
gram and provisions for future delivery, which are collected
by the plaintiff and which cannot be obtained by the defendants except through a known breach of the confidential terms
on which the plaintiff communicates them. It .is sufficient
for the purposes of decision to state the facts without reciting
the pleadings in detail. The plaintiff was incorporated by
special charter of the State of Illinois on February 18, 1859.
The charter incorporated an existing board of trade, and there
seems to be no reason to doubt, as indeed is alleged by the
Christie Gram and Stock Company, that it then managed its
Chamber of Commerce substantially as it has since. The
main feature of its management is that it maintains an exchange hall for the exclusive use of its members, which now
has become one of the great gram and provision markets
of the world. Three separate portions of this hall are known
respectively as the 'Wheat Pit, the Corn Pit, and the Provision
Pit. In these pits the members make sales and purchases
exclusively for future delivery, the members dealing always
as principals between themselves, and being bound practically,,
at least, as principals to those who employ them when they
are not acting on their own behalf.
The quotation of the prices continuously offered and accepted in these pits during business hours are collected at
the plaintiff's expense and handed to the telegraph coin-

panies, which have their instruments close at hand, and by
the latter are sent to a great number of offices. The telegraph
companies all receive the quotations under A contract not to
furnish them to any bucket shop or place where they are used
as a basis for bets or illegal contracts. To that end they agree
to submit applications to the Board of Trade for investigation,
and to require the applicant, if satisfactory, to make a contract with the telegraph company and the Board of Trade,
which, if observed, confines the information within a circle
of persons all contracting with the Board of Trade. The
principal defendants get and publish these quotations in some
way not disclosed. It is said not to be proved that they get
them wrongfully, even if the plaintiff has the rights which it
claims. But as the defendants do not get them from the
telegraph companies authorized to distribute them, have declined to sign the above-mentioned contracts, and deny the
plaintiff's rights altogether, it is a reasonable conclusion that
they get, and intend to get, their knowledge in a way which is
wrongful unless their contention is maintained.
It is alleged in the bills that the principal defendants keep
bucket shops, and the plaintiff's proof on that point fails,
except so far as their refusal to sign the usual contracts may
lead to an inference, but if the plaintiff has the rights which it
alleges the failure is immaterial. The main defense is this.
It is said that the plaintiff itself -keeps the greatest of bucket
shops, in the sense of an Illinois statute of June 6, 1887, that
is, places wherein is permitted the pretended buying and selling of gram, etc., without any intention of receiving and -paying for the property so bought, or of delivering the property
so sold. On this ground it is contended that if under other
circumstances there could be property in the quotations, which
hardly is admitted, the subject matter is so infected with the
plaintiff's own illegal conduct that it is caput lupsnum, and
may be carried off by any one at will.
It appears that in not less than three-quarters of the transactions in the grain pit there is no physical handing over of

BOARD OF TRADE v. CHRISTIE GRAIN & STOCK CO. 247

Opimon of the Court.

any grain, but that there is a settlement, either by the direct
method, so called, or by what is known as ringing up. The
direct method consists simply in setting off contracts to buy
wheat of-a certain amount at a certain time, against contracts
to sell a like amount at the same time, and paying the difference of price in cash, at the end of the business day The
ring settlement is reached by a comparison of books among
the clerks of the members buying and selling in the pit, and
picking out a series of transactions which begins and ends
with dealings which can be set against each other by eliminating those between-as, if A has sold to B five thousand bushels
of May wheat, and B has sold the same amount to C, and C toD and D to A. Substituting D for B by novation, A's sale can.
be set against his purchase, on simply paying the difference,
in price. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
took *the defendant's view of these facts and ordered the bill
to be dismissed. 125 Fed. Rep. 161. The Circuit Court .of
Appeals for the SdVenth Circuit declined to follow this decision
and- granted an injunction as prayed. 130 Fed. Rep. 507
Thereupon writs of certiorari were granted by this Court .and
both caLses are hare.
As has appeared, the plaintiff's chamber of commerce is,
in the first place, a great market, where, through its eighteen
hundred members, is transacted a large part of the grain and
provision business of the world. Of course, in a modem
market contracts are not confined to sales for immediate
delivery People will endeavor to forecast the future and to
make agreements according to their prophecy Speculation
of this kind by competent men is the self-adjustment of society
to the probable. Its value is well known as a means of avoiding or mitigating catastrophes, equalizing prices and providing
for periods of want. It is .true that the success of the strong
induces imitation by the weak, and that incompetent persons
bring themselves to rum by undertaking to speculate in their
turn. But legislatures and courts generally have recognized
that the natural evolutions of a complex society are to be

touched only with a yery cautious hand, and that such coarse
attempts at a remedy for the waste incident to every social
function as a simple prohibition and laws to stop its being are
harmful and vam. This court has upheld sales of stock for
future delivery and the substitution of parties provided for
by the rules of the Chicago Stock Exchange. Clews v Janeson, 182 U. S. 461.
When the Chicago Board of Trade was incorporated we
cannot doubt that it was expected to afford a market for
future as well as present sales, with the necessary incidents
of such a market, and while the 'State of Illinois allows that
charter to stand, we cannot believe- that the pits, merely as.
places where future sales are made, are forbidden by the law
But again, the contracts made in the pits are contracts between the members. We must suppose that-from the beginning as now, if a member had a contract with another member
to buy a -certain aniount of wheat at a certain time and another to sell the same amount at the same time, it would be
deemed unnecessary to exchange warehouse receipts. We
must suppose that then as now, a settlement would be made
by the payment of differences, after the analogy of a clearing
house. This naturally would take place no less that the contracts were made in good faith for actual delivery, since the.
result of actual delivery would be to leave the parties just
where they were before. Set-off has all 'the effects of delivery.
The ring settlement is simply a more complex case of the same
kind. These settlements would be frequent, as the number
of persons buying and selling was comparatively small.
'The fact that contracts are satisfied in this way by set-off
and the payment of differences detracts in no degree from the
good faith of the parties, and if the parties knew when they
make such contracts that they are very likely to have a chance
to satisfy them in that way and intend to make use of it, that
'fact is perfectly consistent with a serious business purpose and
,an intent that the contract shall mean what it says. There is
no doubt, from the rules of the Board of Trade or the evidenace,

that the contracts made between the members are intended
and supposed to be binding in manner and form as they are
made. There is no doubt that a large part of those contracts
is made for serious business purposes. Hedging, for instance,
as it is called, is a means by which collectors and exporters of
gram or other products, and manufacturers who make contracts in advance for the sale of their goods, secure themselves
against the fluctuations of the market by counter contracts
for the purchase or sale, as the case may be, of an.equal quantity of the product, or of the material of manufacture. It is
none the less a serious business contract for a legitimate and
useful purpose that it may be offset before the time of delivery
in'case delivery should not be needed or desired.
Purchases made with the understanding that the contract
will be settled by paying the difference between the contract
and the market price at a certain time, -Embrey v Jmon,
131 U. S. 336, Weare Cbmmssnon Co. v People, 209 Illinois,
528, stand on different ground from purchases made merely
with the expectation that they will be satisfied by set-off.
If the latter might fall within the statute of Illinois, -we would
not be the first to decide that they did when the object was
self-protection in business and not merely a speculation entered into for its own sake. It seems to us an extraordinary
and unlikely jroposition that -the dealings -which give its
character to the-great market for future sales in tlus country
are to be regarded as mere wagers or as "pretended" buying
or selling, without any intention of receiving, and paying for
the property bought, or of delivering the property sold, within
the meaning of the Illinois act. Such a view seems to us
hardly consistent with the admitted fact that the quotations
of prices from the market are of the utmost importance to the
business world, and not least to the farmers; so mportant
indeed, that it.is argued here and has been held in Illinois that
the quotations are clothed with a public use. It seems to. us
hardly Zonsistent with the obvious purposes of the plaintiff's
charter, or indeed with. the words of the statute invoked. The

sales in the pits are not pretended, but, as we have said, are
meant and supposed to be binding. A set-off is in legal effect
a delivery We speak only of the contracts made in the pits,
because in them the members are principals. The subsidiary
rights of their employers where the members buy as brokers
we think it unnecessary to discuss.
In the view which we take, the proportion of the dealings
in the pit which are settled in this way throws no light on the
question of the proportion of serious dealings for legitimate
business purposes to those which fairly can be classed as wagers
or pretended contracts. No more does the fact that the contracts thus disposed of call for many times the total receipts
of gram in Chicago. The fact that they can be and are setoff sufficiently explains the possibility, which is no more
wonderful than the enormous disproportion between the currency of the country and contracts for the payment of money,
many of which in like manner are set off in clearing houses
without any one dreanung that they are not paid, and for the
rest of which the same money suffices in succession, the less
being needed the more rapid the circulation is.
But suppose that the Board of Trade does keep a place
where pretended and unlawful buying and selling are peritted, which as yet the Supreme Court of Illinois, we believe,
has been careful not to intimate, it does not follow that it
should not be protected in this suit. The question whether
it should be involves several elements which we shall take
up in turn.
In the first place, apart from special -objections, the plainttiff's collection of quotations is entitled to the protection of the
law It stands like a trade secret. The plaintiff has the right
to keep the work which it has done, or paid for doing, to itself.
The fact that others might do similar work, if they might,
does not authorize them to steal the plaintiff's. Compare
Blestem v Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U. S..239, 249,
250. The plaintiff does not lose its rights by communicating
the result to persons, even if many, in confidential relations

to itself, under a contract not to make it public, and strangers
to the trust will be restrained from getting at the knowledge
by inducing a breach of trust and using knowledge obtained
by such a breach. Exchange Telegraph Co. v Gregory & Co.,
[1896] 1 Q. B. D. 147, F TV Dodge Co. v Construction Informatzon Co., 183 Massachusetts, 62; Board of Trade v C. B.
.Thomson Commwsswn Co., 103 Fed. Rep. 902; Board of Trade
v Hadden-Krull Co., 109 Fed. Rep. 705, National Tel. News
Co. v Western Unwn Tel. Co., 119 Fed. Rep. 294, Illinois
Commswn Co. v Cleveland Tel. Co., 119 Fed. Rep. 301.
The publications insisted on in some of the arguments were
publications in breach of contract, and do not affect the plaintiff's rights. Time is of the essence in matters like this, and
it fairly may be said that, if the contracts with the plaintiff
are kept, the information will not become public property
until the plaintiff has gained its reward. A pr3rity of a few
minutes probably is enough.
If then the plaintiff's collection of information is otherwise
entitled to protection, it does not cease to be so, even if it is
information concerning illegal acts. The statistics of crime
are property to the same extent as any other statistics, even
if collected by a criminal who furnishes some of the data.
The Supreme Court of Illinois has recognized in the fullest
terms the value and necessity of the knowledge which the
plaintiffs contfol. It must have known, even if it did-not have
the evidence before it, as to which we cannot tell from the
report, what was the course of dealing on the exchange. Yet
it was so far from suggesting that the plaintiff's work was
unmeritorious that it held it clothed'with a public use. New
York & Chwago Grain & Stock Exchange v. Board of Trade,
127 Illinois, 153.
The defendants lay hold of the declaration.m the case last
cited and say, with doubtful consistency, that this information
is of such importance that it is clothed with a public use, and
that, therefore, they are entitled to get and use it. In the case
referred to it was held that the plaintiff, which had been re-

ceiving the continuous quotations, was entitled still to receive
them on paying for them and submitting to all reasonable
requirements in relation to the same. Perhaps the right of
the plaintiff would have been more obvious if it had demanded
an opportunity on reasonable conditions of collecting the information for itself, especially if the legislature had seen fit to
provide by law for its doing so. But it is not necessary to
consider whether we are bound by that decision, or, if not,
should follow it, since in these cases the claim is not qualified
by submission to reasonable rules or an offer of payment. It
is a claim of independent rights and a denial that the plaintiff
has any right at all. The Supreme Court of Illinois gave no
sanction to such a claim as that.
Finally it is urged that the contracts with the telegraph
companies violate the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209.
The short answer is that the contracts are not relied on as a
cause of action. They are stated simply to show that the only
communication of its collected facts by the plaintiff is a confidential communietion, and does not destroy the plaintiff's
rights. But so far as these contracts limit the communication
of what the plaintiff might have refrained from communicating to any one, there is no monopoly or attempt at monopoly,
and no contract in restraint-of trade, either under the statute
or at common law Bement v National Harrow Co., 186
U.. S. 70; Fowle v Park, 131 U S. 88, Elliman v Carnngton,
(1901 2 Ch. 275. It is argued that the true purpose is to
exclude all persons who do not deal through members of the
Board of Trade. Whether there is anything in the law to
hinder these regulations being made with that intent we shall
not consider, as we do not regard such a general scheme as
shown by the contracts or proved. A scheme to exclude
bucket shops is shown and proclaimed, no doubt-and the
defendants, with their contention as to the plaintiff, call this
an attempt at a monopoly in bucket shops. But it is simply
a restraint on the acquisition for illegal purposes of the fruits
of the plaintiff's work. Central Stock & Gram Exchange v.

UNITED STATES v. JU TOY
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 5. Argued April 3, 1905.-Decided May 8,19M.
Even though the Fifth Amendment does apply to one seeking entrance to
this country, and to deny him admission may deprive him of liberty, due
process of law does not necessarily require a judicial trial and Congress
may entrust the decision of his right to enter to an executive officer.
Under the Chinese exclusion, and the immigration, laws, where a person of
Chinese descent asks admssion to the United States, claiming that he
is a native born citizen thereof, and the lawfully designated officers find
that he is not, and upon appeal that finding is approved by the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor, and it does not appear that there was any abuse
of discretion, such finding and action of the executive officers should be
treated by the courts as having been made by a competent tribunal,
with due process of law, and as final and coiclusive; and m habeas corpus proceedings, commenced thereafter, and based solely on the ground
of the applicant's alleged citizenship, the court should dismiss the writ
and not direct new and further evidence as to the question of citizenship.
A person whose right to enter the United States is questioned under the
immigration laws is to be regarded as if he had stopped.at the limit of
its jurisdiction, although physically he may be within its boundaries.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
