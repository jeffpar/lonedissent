VAN REED v. PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK OF
LEBANON.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 229. -SubmittedApril 25, 1905.-Decided May 29,1905.

National banks are qua-public institutions, and for the purpose for which
they are instituted are national in their character, and, within constitutional limits, are subject to control of Congress, and not to be interfered
with by state legislative or .judicial action, except so far as Congress
permits.
-Under § 5242 Rev. Stat. a AationAl bank, whether solvent or insolvent, is
exempt from process of attachment before judgment'in any suit, action or
proceeding in any State, county or municipal court, Pacific NationalBank
v. Mizier, 124 U. S.721, nor can a state court acquire jurisdiction over
a national bank situated in another State by the process of attaching
property within its jurisdiction under § 4 of the act of July 12, 1882.

THE plaintiff, who was the owner of a claim against the defendant, the People's National Bank of Lebanon,, Pennsylvania, commenced an action in the State of New York by
levying an attachment upon the funds of the defendant m that
State, upon the ground that it was a foreign corporation.
The defenAant, appearing specially for that purpose, moved
to have the attachment vacated upon the ground that it was
prohibited by the Revised Statutes'of the United States. At
special term the motion was denied, .the Appellate Division
reversed the judgment of the special term and vacated the
attachment. The Court of Appeals answered two questions
certified to it by the Appellte Division and affirmed the judgment of that court. The two questions propounded are as
follows, 173.N. Y. 314.
"1. Is the defendant exempt from attachment before judgment under section 5242, U S. RevisedStatutes?
"2. Are -the rights claimed by plaintiff, to attachment
agaifiiM the defendant before judgment, and to the jurisdiction

thereby acquired, preserved and given by section 4 of the act
of Congress -of July 12, 1882?"
The Court of Appeals, m affirming the'judgment of the
court below, answered the first question m the affirmaive
and the second question in the negative. The case was then
brought to this court upon writ of error.
Mr. James W M. Newlin for plaintiff in error
What is said in the opinion of this court in Ptcifie National
Bank v Mixter, 124 U S. 721, that all attachments before
judgment against national banks solvent or insolvent are void
under § 5242, is not only obiter but. contradicts the judgment
of the court m the Mixter case itself, which upheld the jurisdiction of the court below, acquired against the non-resident
national bank by reason of the attachments and sustained
the judgments entered below in virtue of this jurisdiction, but
restrained what was practically execution, viz., proceedings on
the bond to dissolve the attachment the bank being itself
insolvent.
The Mixter case has been questioned by this court. Earle

All doubts must be resolved against the jurisdiction of the
United States courts. Petrn v National Bank, 142 U S.

The act of July 12, 1882, introduces a new and unanswerable authority for the proposition that whatever may have

fore judgment, when constituting the basis of jurisdiction, are
now to be sustained. Had the defefhdant m the case at-bar,
been a foreign state bank, with funds here, the New'York
courts would clearly have had jurisdiction through attachment, to impound the funds. Hence under the act of 1882,
the same jurisdiction exists over the funds of a foreign national bank.
If the prohibition of § 5242 be construed to include solvent
banks, then the act of July 12, 1882, conflicts, and being the,
later statute, must prevail.
The trend of legislation ig distinctly toward removing from
national banks any class privilege, or legal advantage of any
description whatever. Pet v National Bank, 142 U S.

MR. JusTicE DAY, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
We deem the answer to the first question already determined
by the decision of this court in PacificNational Bank v Mixter,
124 U. S.721. The right of Congress to determine to what
extent a state court shall- be permitted to entertain actions
against national banks and how far these institutions shall be
subject to state control, is undexiiable. National banks are
quasi-public institutions, and for the purpose for which they
are instituted are national in their character, and, within constitutional limits, are subject to the control of Congress and are
not to be interfered with by state legislative or judicial action,
except so far as the lawmaking power of the Government may
permit. . Section 5242 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States is as follows:
"All transfers of the notes, bonds, bills of exchange, or other

evidences of debt owing to any national banking association,
or of deposits to its credit, all assignments of mortgages,
sureties on real estate, or of judgments or decrees in its favor;
all deposits of money, bullion, or other valuable thing for its
use, or for the use of an of its shareholders or creditors; and
all payments of money to either, made after the commission
of an act of insolvency, or in contemplation thereof, made with
a view to prevent the application of its assets in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, or with'a view to the preference
of one creditor to another, except in payment of its circulating
notes, shall be utterly null and void, and no attachment, injunction or execution shall be issued against suich association
or its property before final judgment in any suit, action, or
proceeding, in any state) county, or mumcmpal court." 3
Compiled Statutes, 1901, p. 3517
The language of the latter clause of this section would seem
to be too plain to admit of discussion as-to its meaning. It in
terms forbids the issuing of an attachment, mjunction or execution against a national bank or Its property before final judgment in any suit, action or proceeding in any State, county or
municipal court. This 'ias the view taken by this court in
Bank v Mixter, supra. The origin of section 5242, and its
growth from previous enactments .were pointed out by Mr.
Chief Justice Waite, who delivered the opinion of the court
in that case.

"It is clear to our minds that, as it stood originally as part
of §57, act of 1873, and as it stands now in the Revised Statutes,
it operate. -as a prohibition upon all attachments against national banks under the authority of the state courts.
It stands now, as it did originally, as the paramount law of
the land that attachments shall not issue from state courts
against national banks, and writes into all state attachment
laws an exception in favor of national banks. Since the act
of 1873 all the attachment laws of the State must be read as
if they contained a provision in express terms that they were
not to applV to suits against a national bank."

Opinion of the Court.

Since the rendition of that decision it has been generally
followed as an authoritative construction of the statute holding
that no attachment can issue from a state court before judgment against a national bank or its property Freeman
ManufacturingCo. v Naiwnal'Bank of the Republic, 160 Massachusetts, 398, Planters' Loan and Savtngs Bank v, Berry, 91
Georgia, 264, First National Bank of Casson v. La Due, 39
Minnesota, 415, Safford v First National Bank of Plattsburg,
61 Vermont, 373, Rosenhetm Real Estate Co. v Southern National Bank, 46 S. W Rep. [Tenn.] 1026, Garner v Second
National Bank of Prondence, 66 Fed. Rep. 369. It is argued
by the plaintiff m error that the decision m the Mixter case,
supra, should be limited to cases where the bank is insolvent;
but the statement of facts in that case shows that at the time
when the attachment was issued the bank was a going concern
and entirely solvent so far as the record discloses. The language of Chief Justice Waite, above quoted, is broad and
applicable to all conditions of national banks, whether solvent
or insolvent; and there is nothing in the statute, which is likewise specific in its terms, giving the right of foreign attachment as against solveit national banks. Ve find nothing in
the case of Earle v Pennsylvania, 178 U S.449, which qualifies
the d ecision announced in the Mixter case. We therefore conclude that the Mixter case is applicable here, and the decision
therein announced meets with our approval.
The answer to the second question involves a consideration
of the act relating to national banks of July 12, 1882, §4,
22 Stat. 162, which is as follows:
"That any association so extending the period of its succession shall continue to enjoy all the rights and privileges and
immunities granted and-shall continue to be subjedt to all the
duties, liabilities, and restrictions imposed by the Revised
Statutes of the United States and other acts having reference to
national banking associations, and it shall continue to be in
all respects the identical association it was before the extension
of its period of succession. Provded, however, That the juris-

diction for suits hereafter brought by or against any association established under any law providing for national banking
associations, except suits between them and the United States,
..or its officers and agents, shall be the same as, and not other
than, the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized
under any law of the United States, which do or might do banking business where such national banking associations mnay be
doing business when such suits may be begun. and all laws and
parts of laws of the United States inconsistent with this pro-viso be, and the same are hereby, repealed."
There is nothing to this section enlarging the right of attachment against national banks. Before the passage of this section Circuit Courts of the .United States had jurisdiction of
suits against .national banks because they were corporations
of Federal origin. It was the purpose of this legislation to
deprive such banks of the right to invoke the jurisdiction of
the Federal courts simply upon the ground that they were
created by and exercised their powers under the acts of Congress. Petr v Commermal Bank, 142 U S. 644, Continental
National Bank v Buord, 191 U. S. 119, 123. It regulated the
jurisdiction of the courts to entertain such actions against
corporations of this character, and had nothing to do with
the kind and.character of remedies which could be had against
them. Certainly there is nothing in the act repealing.the prior
provisions of section 5242, above quoted.
It is further insisted that whether or not the lien is absolute
upon the property of the bank, jurisdiction is obtained of it
by the issuing of the attachment; but we cannot take this
view There was no personal service in the court of original
jurisdiction, and the attachment being without the power of
the court by reason of the terms of the Federal statute, no
jurisdiction was acquired in the case, either over the person
or property of the defendant. We see no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York, and the same is

Affirmed.
