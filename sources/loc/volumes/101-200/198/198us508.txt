the ordinance than the Chinese as to whom it was not enforced. No latitude of intention should be indulged in a case
like this. There should be certainty to every intent. Plaintiff-m error seeks to set aside a criminal law of the State, not
on the ground that it is unconstitutional on its face, not that
it is discrimnhtory in tendency and ultimate actual operation
as the ordinance was which was passed on in the Yick Wo
case, but that it was made so by the manner of its admmistration. This is a matter of proof, and no fact should be omitted
to make it out completely, when the power of a Federal court
is invoked to interfere with the course of criminal justice of
a State.
We think, therefore, the judgment of the Superior Court
should be and it is hereby
Affirmed.

THE SUPREME LODGE, KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS, v.
MEYER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 234. Argued Apri 28, 1905.-Decided Nay 29,1905.
A certificate of insurance on the life of a member residing in New York in
a mutual association was executed by the officers in Illinois; it provided
that it should first take effect as a binding obligation when accepted
by the member, and the member accepted it m New York. It contamed a provision that it was to be null and void in case of suicide of
insured and also one waiving all right to prevent physicians from testifying as to knowledge derived professionally. After the insured died
the association defended an action brought in New York on the ground
of suicide and blaimed that §§ 834, 836, N. Y. Code 'Civil Procedure,
under which the court excluded testimony of physicians in regard to condition of deceased, were inapplicable because the policy was an Illinois

contract and also because m view of the waiver in the certificate their
enforcement impaired the obligation of the contract. Held, that:
The general rule is that all matters respecting the remedy and the admissibility of evidence depend upon the law of the State where the suit
is brought.
Under the circumstances of tis case the contract was a New York contract and not an Illinois contract.
As §§ 834, 836, of the N. Y. Code of Civil Procedure, were enacted prior
to the execution of the contract involved, they could not impair its
obligation.
In cases of this nature this court accepts the construction given by the
courts of the State to its statutes, and even if under § 709, Rev. Stat.,
this court could review all questions presented by the-record, the judgment should be affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
-Mr. Carlos S. Hardy and Mr. Lawrence G. Goodhart for
plaintiff in errorThe terms of the certificate, the laws and rules of the association, together with the application for membership, constitute the contract which existed between the member and

the society Sabrn v. Phrnney, 134 N. Y., 143, Hellenberg v

It was, therefore, competent to introduce evidence which
the trial court excluded, tending to prove that Meyer committed suicide.
The contract in suit is within the protection of the nonimpairment clause of the Federal Constitution. Art. I, § 9,
el. 7
This contract is therefore not to have its obligations impaired by any act of the State of New York. 15 Ency of
Law, 2d ed., 1032.

Plaintiff in error is not a resident of New York, but is a
Federal corporation, organized under the act of Congress.
The contract consisted of an offer made on the sixth day of

September, 1894, and its acceptance.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Pursuant to the terms of the offer, the last act which changed
the offer of Meyer into a contract between him and the defendant; that is, the acceptance of the offer, was the issuance
of the certificate and no other act, matter or thing was necessary after such acceptance was evidenced in this record
to.create the obligation of contract on the part of the defendant,-and the one party being bound by the contract, it of
necessity follows that the other party was likewise bound by
the contract.
The acceptance of this offer, which was the act of the creation of the contract between the parties, took place at Chicago,
by the execution of the certificate-of membership. Nothing
remamed to be done. The contract had arisen, and the acceptance which made up a contract, took placein Illinois, and it
is, therefore, an Illinois contract, and the lex loci celebrationis
applies. 22 Ency of Law, 2d ed., 1324, Bascom v Zediker,

The contract is an Illinois contract, made with reference to
the laws of that State, and the evidence rejected at the tria
is admissible without the waiver and the waiver is entirely
effective and the exceptions to its rejection must be sustained.
Where (as in the case at bar) a proposal is made by a person
residing in the State of New York, to a corporation having its
residence in the State of Illinois, and is in Illinois accepted,
the place of acceptance and not the place of proposal is the
place of the contract, and is in all respects and for all purposes

And where, by the terms of the offer, it is not to become

It will be presumed that the contract is to be performed
at the place where it is made (s. e., Chicago, Illinois), and is
to be governed by the law of Illinois, unless there is something in the terms of the contract, or m the explanatory circumstances of its execution inconsistent with that intention.

The contracts rest on like obligations. Tlie rates are the
same to all. Should it have to pay in suicide cases more than
the stipulated amount m New York, and only the covenanted
sum m Illinois, the burdens are unequally placed and equity
has not been done.
The interpretation of the contract, and of the rights and
obligations of the parties thereto, are regulated by the law
prevailing at the place of performance, and how much more
is this true when the place of performance is the place of
execution. St. Nicholas Bank v State Nat. Bank, 128 N. Y

The last essential act to complete the contract was the acceptance of the application, and, as this was done, and could
only be done by the terms of the offer contained in the application, by the board of control, at Chicago, Illinois, it is in
that place, under all the authorities, that the contract arose.

The policy was signed by the officers of the association at
Chicago on September 20; and was accepted by the assured
September 28, 1894, in New York.
The last act in connection with this contract was performed
at New York and the policy did not become effective until the
first premium had been paid, and as that was to be paid in
New York, where assured resided, therefore, the place of payment is the place of contract. Equitable Life Assur Soc. v.

As the contract sued upon in this case was made subsequent

The non-impairment clause of the Constitution prohibits a
State from enacting a law which.will impair the obligatibn of
an existing contract. This clause was not intended to prohibit a State from enacting a law prohibiting certain contracts
in the future. It was intended as a protection to existing
contracts only Denney v Bennett, 128 U. S. 489; Brown v
Smart, 145 U S. 454. A law in force at the time of making
a contract does not impair its obligation. Ohw v McClure,

A judgment of a state court cannot be reviewed because it
refuses to give effect to a valid contract, or because the judgment impairs the obligation of a contract. It must be a
statute of a State which impairs the obligation of a contract.
Knox v Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379.
MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the .court.

The plaintiff in error is a corporation organized under an
act of Congress approved June 29,. 1894. This action was
brought against it by defendant in error as payee in a certain
benefit certificate issued by it to Emanuel Meyer, husband of
Henrietta Meyer, dated September 20, 1894, whereby it insured his life in the sum of $2,000. The defendant in error
obtained judgment, which, was successively affirmed by the
Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals of New York.
The judgment of affirmance was entered in the Supieme Court,
to which the case was remitted, and this writ of error was then
-sued out.
There are two questions in the case, the place of the contract

OCTOBER TERM.,

Opmion of the Court.

198 U. S.

and the effect of the following provision in the certificate of
insurance:
"And I hereby, for myself, my heirs, assigns, representatives
and beneficiaries, expressly waive any and all provisions of
.law, now or hereafter in force, prohibiting or excusing any
physician heretofore or hereafter attending me .professionally
or otherwise, from disclosing or testifying to any information
acquired thereby, or making such physician incompetent as a
witness; and hereby consent that any such physician may
testify to and disclose any information so derived or received
in any suit or proceeding wherein the same may be material."
This provision takes pertinence from another, whereby "it
is agreed that if death shall result by self-destruction, whether
sane or Insane," the certificate "shall be null and void, and all
claims on account of such membership shall be forfeited."
The case was submitted for a special verdict on the question
"did Emanuel Meyer, the husband of the plaintiff in error,
commit suicide?" The jury answered "No."
On the trial plaintiff in error offered the testimony of three
physicians who attended Meyer, as to declarations made by
him tending to show that he had taken poison with suicidal
intent. It appeared that Meyer did not request the attendance of the physicians-mdeed, protested against treatment.
The testimony was excluded under sections 834 and 836 of the
Code of Civil Procedure of the State. Section 834 forbids any
physician "to disclose any information which he acquired in
attending a patient, in a professional capacity,.and which was
necessary to enable him to act in that capacity," and section 836 provides that section 834 applies "unless the provisions thereof are expressly waived upon the trial or exammation

.

.

by the

patient.

But a physician

may upon a trial or examination disclose any information as to the mental or physical condition of a patient
who is deceased, which he acquired in attending such patients
professionally, except confidential communications, and such
facts as would tend to disgrace the memory of the patient,

KNIGHITS OF PYTHIAS v. MEYPR.
198 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

when the provisions of section 834 have been expressly waived
on such trial or examination by the personal representatives
of the deceased patient."
The Court of Appeals held that the physicians were "attending a patient in their professional capacity;" that the
information that they acquired "was necessary to enable"
them "to act in that capacity," and that their testimony was
therefore properly excluded under sections 834 and 836. The
court also held that the certificate of insurance was a New
York contract. Judge Gray and Chief Judge Parker concurred in the former view, but dissented as to the application
of the code sections. Plaintiff in error contests both sections.
The argument is that (1) it appears from the testimonium
clause of the certificate.of insurance that it was signed and
sealed by plaintiff m error at Chicago, Illinois, and hence is
an Illinois contract, and must be construed with regard to the
law of that jurisdiction, and as there is no -evidence of. what
that law is it must be assumed to be what the common law
of the State is, and under that law the testimony of the physicians was admissible. (2) We quote counsel. "The attempted
application of sections 834 and 836 of the Civil Code of Procedure of the State of New York to the contract in, the case at
bar is a violation of the Federal Constitution."
These contentions may be said to have the same ultimate
foundation, but regarding them as s~parate and independent,
the first is based on the ground that plaintiff in error derived
the right from its contract with Meyer to the testimony of the
physicians, which right attended the contract m whatever
forum suit upon the contract might be brought. This is certainly debatable. The general rule is that all matters respecting the remedy and admissibility of evidence depend
upon the law of the State where the suit is brought. Northern
Pacific R. R. Co. v Babcock, 154 U. S. 190; Wilcox v Hunt,
13 Pet. 378, Pritchardv Norton, 106 U. S. 124; Bank of the
United States v Donnally, 8 Pet. 361.
However, if, the certificate of insurance is not. an Illinois

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

198 U. S.

contract, all the questions which depend upon that become
irrelevant. We think it is not an Illinois contract. Judge
Gray, expressing the opinion of the Court of Appeals, disposed of the contention that the certificate of insurance is an
Illinois contract briefly but completely The learned judge
said.
"With respect to the first of these questions [that the legislation of New York 'impaired the obligation of the contract between plaintiff in error and Meyer] raised by the appellant,
whatever other answers might be made to the applicability of
the provision of the Federal Constitution relied upon, it is
sufficient to say, now, that this contract was consummated m
the State of New York and is to be governed, in its enforcement, by the laws of that State. The beneficiary was a resident of this State and there made his application for the
insurance. The certificate, ssuing upon the application, appears, from its language only, to have been signed by the officers
of the defendant at Chicago, in the State of Illinois, on September 20th, 1894, but upon it was printed the following
clause. 'I hereby accept this certificate of membership subject
to All the conditions therein contained,' and that had the signature of the applicant followed by the words, 'Dated at New
York, this 28th day of September, 1894, attest: Louis Riegel,
secretary section 2179, Endowment Rank, K of P' By the
terms of the certificate, the agreement of the defendant was
subject, not only to the conditions subscribed to by the member in his application, but ' to the further conditions and agreements hereinafter named,' and the clause containing his
.acceptance, above quoted, was one of those 'further agree•ments.' From these terms of the agreements of the parties
the only natural conclusion is that the place of the contract
was where it was intended, and understood, to be consummated., Its completion depended upon the execution by the
member of the further agreement indorsed upon the certificate: namely, to accept it 'subject to all the conditions therein
contained.' The contract was not completed, in the sense that

KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS v. MEYER.
19S U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it was binding upon either party to it, until it was delivered
n New York after the execution by the member of the further
agreement expressing his unqualified acceptance of its conditions. As matter of fact, the promise of the defendant was to
pay the insurance moneys to the plaintiff, who resided in New
York; a feature -giving additional local coloring to the contract. But the sufficient and controlling fact is that, by its
terms, it was first to take effect as a binding obligation, when
the required agreement on the part of the member was executed by him:"
2. The ground of this contention is not made clear. The
language of counsel points to the contract clause of the Constitution as that relied on, and to render it available makes the
law of Illinois the obligation of the contract of insurance.
But this can only be upon the supposition, which we have seen
is erroneous, that- the certificate of insurance was an Illinois
contract, not a New York contract. Being a New York contract, the code sections did not impair its obligation. They
were enacted before the contract was executed, and if they
were a valid exercise of legislative power, and we have no
doubt they were, it was competent for the State to enact the
rule of evidence expressed in them. The case is in this narrow
compass, and we need not further follow the details of the argument of counsel that the obligation of the contract of insurance
was impaired. But we may observe that there is no question
in the case of the validity or the enforcement of the provision
in the certificate of insurance against suicide. It is only of
the testimony offered to prove suicide. Plaintiff in error
sought to prove it by the testimony of a physician, and the
attempt encountered the New York Code and the questions
we have discussed.
Plaintiff in error further contends that, as in writs of error
to the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, we are
not restricted to constitutional questions, so in writi of error
to a stat court we may also decide all questions presented by
the record and that it is open for us to decide whether the

relation of doctor and patient existed between one of the witnesses and Meyer. This is attempted to be made out by that
part of section 709 of the Revised Statutes, which provides:
"The writ [to the final judgment or decree of a state court]
shall have the same effect as. if the judgment or decree corn-'
plamed of had been rendered or passed on in a court of the
United States."
However this may be, rn cases like that at bar, we ac.'ept
the construction the state courts give to state statutes. It is
manifest that the question submitted involves the construction
of the state statute. Plaintiff m error is not helped by the '
decision m Foley v Royal Arcanum, 151 N. Y. 196. It was
there decided that a waiver m a policy of insurance was valid
under sections 834 and 836, as they then stood, and their subsequent amendment did not affect the waiver. But the certiflate of insurance in the case at bar was iiade after the
amendment to section 836. In Holden v Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co., 165 N. Y 13, it was held that the statute, by virtue
of the amendment, "in positive and express terms, requires
the waiver to be made upon or at the time of the trial or
examination," and "no one except the personal representatives of the deceased patient can waive the provisions of
section 834, and it can be waived by them only upon the trial
or examination where .the evidence is offered or received."
Foley v Royal Arcanum was referred to and limited to the
construction of the statute as it stood before amendment.
The opinion of the Court of Appeals in the case at bar follows
the Holden case and distinguishes prior cases.
Judgment affirmed.
