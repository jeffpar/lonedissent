UNION TRUST COMPANY, AND SECURITY WAREHOUSING COMPANY v. WILSON.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FROM THESEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 424. Submitted January 6, 1905.-Decided May 29, 1905.
Prior to the petition the bankrupt, a wholesale merchant m Chicago, walled

off part of the-basement of his store and let it at a nominal rental to a
warehouse company and there stored goods, so that they were not seen
from the store, and the company alone had access thereto; and it exhibited
signs to the effect that it occupied the premises and had possession of
the goods, it charged the merchant for-storage, and issued to him certificates or receipts for the goods, which he pledged and endorsed over
to banks as collateral for loans." In an action brought by the trustee
who claimed that goods were in the possession of the bankrupt and not
of the warehouse company, Held, that:
A bailee asserting a lien for charges has the technical possession of the goods.
The transfer of a warehouse receipt is not E;symbolical delivery, but a real
delivery to the same extent as if the goods had been transported to another warehouse named by the pledgee.
Upon the facts m this case there isno reason to deny such a place of storago
the character of a public warehouse so far as the Illinois statutes are
concerned.
The receipt issued in this case were to be deemed valid warehouse receipts
so that their endorsement and delivery as security for loans constituted
a pledge of the goods represented thereby valid as against attaching
creditors, and if the receipts were not valid as warehouse receipts, the
transactiQn constituted an equally valid pledge of the goods as such

security.
UPON

the facts the following questions of law were certified.

1. Whether, upon the facts above recited, the receipts issued by the warehousing company are to be deemed valid
warehouse receipts, so that their endorsement by Flanders to
the trust company, as security for loans, constituted a pledge
or pledges to the trust company of the leather covered by such
receipts, vhich would be valid against attaching creditors.
2. Whether, if the receipts are not to be depmed valid as
warehouse receipts, upon the facts above recite the transactions are to be regarded as constituting pledges of such leather

3. If there was no pledge, whether the trust company, under the facts above recited, acqvired tin equitable lien upon

m bankruptcy
Mr Henrj S. Robbzns, with whom Mr Charles R. Holden
was on the brief, for the Uion Trust Company and the Security Warehousing CompanyThe receipts are valid and their endorsement constituted a
valid pledge. They were issued under a now system of warehousing, created by the requirements of modern commercer
and resulting from the commendable ain of our business men
to cheapen the cost of production and distribution.
The question here is-as it was in the case of bulk warehnusing of grain-whether the law will obstruct, or conform to.
the requirements of modern commerce.
While it is competent for a State, within constitutional
limits, to regulate warehousing within its borders, and declare
what shall constitute a warehouse and what a warehouse
receipt, Illinois has not, is respects this kind of warehousing,
seen fit to adopt any statute mposing any restrictions. Article XIII, § 1, Const. Illinois, 1870; §§ 1, 2, 24, Rev Stat.
Illinois,-'ch. 114.
The enclosure in this case .falls within the definition of a
public warehouse; property was stored there for compensation. Unwn Trust Co. v Trumbull, 137 Illinois, 146.
Ample steps were taken to notify anyone seeing the prop.
erty or the premises, as to actual possession and control.
Placing property in a room, leased to, and kept.locked by,
a vendee or pledgee-or warehouseman, accompamedcby a continuous display of signs and.placards plainly indicating the
vendee's, pledgee's or warefiouseman's interest, is a sufficient
change of possession to make the transaction a valid one.

MR. JUSTiCE HOLME.s delivered the opinion of the court.
The questions certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals arise
upon the following facts, abridged from the statement submitted to us. The bankrupt, Flanders, was a wholesale
leather dealer. He walled off a part of the basement of his
place of business, and let it at a; nominal rent to the .Security
Warehousing Company There were doors to this part, with
padlocks bearing the name of the compan:3, which were kept
locked and to which the company had the only keys. The
coinpany had a key to Flanders' front door and access to the
'part let to it, at all hours of di.y or night. No one else could
get such access withdut breaking m. There were two signs
on the outside, stating m large letters that the premises were
occupied by the company as a public warehouseman. The
company received leather from Flanders into this phlce, issuing

Opinion of the Court.

a certificate that it had received the same on storage subject
to the order of H. L. Flanders & Co., and identifym-g the
leather; "said commodity to be retained on storage and delivered only upon surrender of this receipt properly -endorsed
and payment of all charges thereon." To every parcel of the
leather was attached a card legibly stating that it was in the
possession of the Warehouse Company The company stipulated in the receipt against liability for damage by fire, water,
etc., and by a general contract with Flanders the latter assumed all risk of loss except from dishonesty of the company's.
servants. Flanders paid the company twenty dollars a month
for the first $10,000 worth of property or less, and a dollar a
month for each additional $1,000. He also paid the expenses
of the company- m connection with storing the goods. The
certificates of the company issued as above were all endorsed
by Flanders to the Union Trust Company as security for loans
made by it to him in the regular course of business. If Flanders
desired to remove any part of the leather he paid the necessary
sum to the Trust Company, was entrusted with the receipts,
got the Warehouse Company to send a man to unlock the place
of enclosure and allow the removal, endorsing on the receipt
the amount delivered if less than all, and then, as the case
might be, returned the receipt to the Trust Company or surrendered it into the Warehousing Company's hands.
Flanders became bankrupt and his trustee filed a bill in the
District Court, alleging the storage arrangement to have been
fraudulent, and claning the leather on the ground that it
always had been m the possession of Flanders, and therefore
had come to the possession of the trustee. Upon these facts
the Circuit Court of Appeals certifies the following questioiis:
"1. Whether, upon the facts above recited, the receipts
issued by the warehousing company are to be deemed valid
warehouse receipts, so that their endorsement by Flanders to
the trust company, as security for loans, constituted'a pledgeor pledges to the trust. company of the leather covered by such
receipts, which would be valid against attaching creditors.

"2. Whether,. if the receipts are not to be deemed valid as
warehouse recezpts, upon the facts above recited, the transactions are to be regarded as constituting pledges of such leather
by Flanders to the trust company, which would be valid as
against attaching creditors.,
"3. If there was no pledge, whether the trust company,
'under the facts above recited, acquired an equitable lien upon
such leather that is superior to the title thereto of the trustee
in bankruptcy."
No question under the statutes of Illinois is suggested.
Apart from statute a warehouse receipt simply- imports that
the goods are m the hands of a certain kind of bailee. A bailee
asserting a lien for charges has the technical possession of the
goods. But it always is recognized that if the bailee of the
owner, by direction of the latter, assents to becoming bailee
for another to whom the owner has sold, mortgaged or pledged
the goods, the change in the character of the bailee's holding
sAtisfies the requirement of achange of possessionto validate
the sale or pledge. Therefore it is-common for certain classes
of bailees to giv4 receipts to the order of the bailor, because by
a receipt in that form the bailee assents in advance to becoming
bailee for any one who is brought within the terms of the
receipt by an endorsement of the same. That, at least, is the
argument of Benjamin on Sales, 2d ed., 676 et seq., 6th Am.
ed., 795, § 817, is the understanding of merchants, and is the
principle adopted as to -public warehouse receipts by the statutes of Illinois, Rev Stat., c. 114, §24, and probably adopted
by the courts, apart from statute. Unson Trust Co. v Trumbull, 137 Illinois, 146,. 173, Northrop.v First Nat. Bank of
Chicago, 27 IL App. 527, Millhiser Manuf. Co. v Gallego Mills
C(o., 101 Virginia, 579, 589; Hallgartenv Oldham, 135 Massa-

chusetts, 1, 10. The transfer of the receipt is not a symbolical
delivery; it is a real delivery to the same extent as if the goods
had been transported to another warehouse named by the
pledgee.
If then the Security Warehousing Company had possession

of the goods, it had it as bailee, and, unless some reason appears to the contrary, the endorsement of its receipt, the same
being drawn to Flanders' order, was a delivery sufficient to
validate the pledge. But there can be no doubt on the facts as
stated, without more, that the company had possession of the
goods. It had them under lock and key. in a place to which
it had a legal title and right of access by lease. Even if it had
not had a right of access to the place it would have had possession of the contents of the room, according to the analogy
of the settled law that a carrier who breaks bulk and takes the
goods is guilty of larceny Y B. 13 Ed. IV 9, pl. 5. The
act is a trespass as agreed in Keilway, 160, pl. 2. Ward v.
Turner, 1 Dick. 170, 172; S. C., 2 Ves. Sr. 431, 443, Moore v
Mansfield, 182 Massachusetts, 302, 303. So, again, if the goods
had been in a place under the exclusive control of the company, even without the company's knowledge they would have
been in the company's possession. Elwes v Brgg Gas Co.,
33 Ch. D. 562, 568, Reg. v Rowe, Bell, C. C. 93. See Barker
v Bates, 13 Pick. 255, 257, 261, Northern Pacific Railroadv
Leuns, 162 U. S. 366, 378, 379, 382. When there is conscious
control, the intent to exclude and the exclusion of others, with
access to the place of custody as of right, there are all the elements of possession in the fullest sense. Gough v. Everard,
2 H. & C. 1, 8, Ancona v Rogers, 1 Ex. Div 285.
We deal with the case before us only No doubt there are
other'cases in which the exclusive power of the so-called bailee
gradually tapers away until we reach those in which the courts
have held as matter of law that there was no adequate bailment. Bank v Jagode, 186 Pa. St. 556, Drury v Moors, 171
Massachusetts, 252. So, different views have been entertained
where the owner has undertaken to constitute himself a bailee
by issuing a receipt. We may concede, for purposes of argument, that all the forms gone through in this case might be
emptied of significance by a different uqnderstanding between
the parties, which the form was intended to disguise. But no
such understanding is stated here, and it cannot be assumed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

198 U. S.

There is no reason even to infer it as a conclusion of fact, if such
references were open to us to draw It is true that the evident
motive of Flanders was to get his goods represented by a document for convenience of pledging rather than to get them
stored, and the method and amount of compensation show it.
But that was a lawful motive and did not invalidate his acts if
otherwise sufficient. He could get the goods by producing
the receipt and paying- charges, of course, but there is no hint
that the company did not insist upon its control. It is suggested that the goods gave credit to the owner. But, in answer .to this, it is enough to say that the goods were not visible
to any one entering the shop. They could be surmised only
by going to the basement, where signs gave notice of the company's possession, and probably could be seen only if the company unlocked the doors. There is nothing stated which
warrants us in doubting that all the transactions were in g6od
faith.
Although the first question does not refer in terms to the
statutes of Illinois it is proper to add that we see no sufficient
reason for denying to the place of storage the character of a
public warehouse. "Public warehouses of Class C shall embrace all other warehouses or places where property of any
kind is. stored for a consideration." Rev Stat. c. 114, § 2.
These sweeping words embrace any place so used, whether
owned or hired-by the warehousemen, and, if so, they embrace
as well a place hired of the owner of the goods as one hired of
anybody else. See Sumner v Hamlet, 12 Pick. 76, Gough v. Everard,2 H. & C. 1. If we are right in this, then the endorsement of the receipts transferred the property in the leather by
thetexpress terms of. the statute already referred to. Rev
Stat., c. 114, § 24. If not, we should come to the same result
by the common law, for even if we did not adopt the argument
of Mr. Benjamin to which we have referred above, against the
earlier view of Blackburn on Sales, 297, followed in Farzna v.
Home, 16 M. & W 119, still all the authorities agree that, if an
assent in advance is not enough, yet as soon as the bailee

attorns to the assignee the delivery is complete. The statement has not this point in view But we should suppose that
a, fuller statement would make it plain that the Warehouse
Company knew and assented to the transfers to the Trust
Company, if that be material, which we do not imply See
also Unson Trust Co. v Trumbull, 137 Illinois, 146, 173, Millhiser Manuf. Co. v Gallego Mills Co., 101 Virginia, 579, 589;
Gibson v Stevens, 8 How 384, 399.
As we answer the first and second questions in the affirmative, it is unnecessary to consider the third.
It will be so certified.

WHITNEY v. WENMAN.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED ,STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 570. Submitted April 24, 190-Decided Blay 29, iOS.
The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction of a proceeding in the nature of a
plenary action brought by the trustee to determine controversies in
relation to property held by the bankrupt or by other parties for him,
and the extent and character of liens thereon; and this applies to a suit
brought against parties claiming possession of goods in the bankrupt's
store, as warehousemen, under a nominal lease of the store from the
bankrupt.
A receiver in bankruptcy is appointed as a temporary custodian and it is
his duty to hold possession of property until the termination of the
proceedings or the appointment of the trustee, and meanwhile the bankruptcy court has possession of the property and jurisdiction to hear and
determine the interests of those claiming liens thereon or ownership
-thereof, and this jurisdiction canot be affected by the receiver turning
the property over to any person without the authority of the court.
