CIRCUIT.

No. 53. Argued November 4,1903.-Decided December 7,1903.
1. Geographic names often acquire a secondary signification indicative not
only of the place of manufacture but of the name of the manufacturer or
producer, and the excellence of the thing manufactured or produced,
which enables the manufacturer or owner to assert an exclusive right to
such name as against every one not doing business within the same geographical limits; and even as against them, if the name be used fraudulently for the purpose of misleading buyers as to the actual origin of
the thing produced or palming off the productions of one person as those
of another.
2. One otherwise entitled to the exclusive use of a name may lose the right
of enforcing it by laches and acquiescing for a period of nearly thirty
years in its use and by allowing the name to become generic and indicative of the character of the article.
The rule of nullum tempus cannot be invoked in our courts in favor of a,
foreign government suing for the benefit of an individual which is its,

Qucere, and not decided, whether the rule could be invoked by a foreign
government even when suing in its sovereign capacity.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Statement of the Case.

-

191 U. S.

It was not intended by Article VIII of the Industrial Property Treaty of
June 11, 1887, to put citizens of a foreign country on a more favorable
footing than our own citizens or to exempt them from ordinary defences
which might be made by the party prosecuting. Under Article 1I of
such treaty, the rights of the French Republic are the same and no
greater than those of the United States would be.
3. Where it does not appear that there has been any actual fraud or an
attempt to foist an article upon the public as that of the complainant
and the articles differ in many respects, the use of a name, the exclusive use whereof is claimed by complainant, accompanied by a descriptive word equally prominent which differentiates it from the original
name on a label wholly dissimilar in style, language and form, will not,
after a long continued use without protest, justify the interference of a
court of equity to restrain its use.

Tis was a bill in equity brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Northern District of New York, by the
French Republic, as owner, and La Compagnie Fermire de
l'Etablssement Thermal de Vichy, (hereinafter termed the
Vichy Company,) as lessee, of the springs of Vichy, France,
against the Saratoga Vichy Spring Company, for the unlawful
use of the word "Vichy," claimed by the plaintiffs as a commercial name or trade-mark, and appropriated for the waters
of the defendant, which are drawn from a certain natural
spring at Saratoga, New York.
Defence: That for fifty years mineral water has been sold
throughout the world under the name of "Vichy," and that
such name has come to denote a type of water, namely, alkaline,
non-cathartic, carbonated water, and does not stand for the
water of any one spring; that defendant has never sold Vichy
as and for that of the plaintiffs, nor in resemblance thereto, but
has so labelled its water that the purchaser shall know that it
is a natural mineral water of Saratoga; and that plaintiffs'
claim is stale.
The bill was dismissed by the Circuit Court upon the ground
that plaintiffs had no exclusive right to the use of the word
"Vichy," and that defendant had never been guilty of an
attempt to palm off its waters as the imported article. 99
Fed. Rep. 733. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed

the decision of the Circuit Court, and granted an injunction
against the use of one particular label, or "any other label in
which the place of the origin of the water is not as plainly and
prominently made known as the fact that it is named ' Vichy.'"
107 Fed. Rep. 459.
Plaintiffs thereupon applied for a writ of certiorari, which
was granted. Defendant made no similar application, but
acquiesced in the decree and discontinued the offending label.
Mr. Charles Bulkley Hubbell and Mr. Archibald Cox for appellants:
In the absence of the defence relating to the use by the public
in the United States of the word "Vichy," the complainants
would be entitled to an injunction restraining the use of the
word "Vichy" to describe, or as the name of, a water not drawn
from the springs at Vichy. Congress & Empire Spring Co. v.

The defence based on the uses of the word "Vichy" in the
United States is valueless: the fact that the principal complainant is a sovereign power renders the defence of laches
inapplicable. The French government, being the owner of the
springs and the name appurtenant thereto, is materially interested in the subject matter of the suit and a proper party.

If the government of the United States were a complainant

The reasons which are good to preclude the imputation
of laches in a suit by the United States apply with equal
force to a suit by the French Republic. The testimony relating to the irresponsible and untruthful usage of the word
"Vichy" should not be considered because it tends only to
show a custom or usage which, being unreasonable, uncertain
and grounded upon fraud, should not be recognized. United

The intent of article 8 of the treaty in force between the
Republic of France and the United States was to prevent the
loss of foreign commercial names resulting from anticipatory
use, infringement or spoliation. It is submitted that it should
not be reasoned that the protection guaranteed by the treaty
can be defeated by showing the existence of the very abuses
it was framed to prevent. Saxlehner v. Eisner, 179 U. S. 19;

Mr. Edgar T. Brackett for appellee:
Defendant did not act in bad faith; in all its labels and
advertising it distinguished itself by name, and its water from
that sold by appellant; there has been no deceit toward the
public; the name SaratogaVichymakes no claim to being Vichy
imported from France, and the only conclusion deducible from
the name is that the water comes from Saratoga and has certain qualities like the Vichy. This is perfectly legitimate.

relief will not be granted. Jennings v. Johnson, 37 Fed. Rep.
364; Cohn v. Hoffman House, 7 Misc. Rep. N. Y. 461.
Defendant's bottles and packages are not indentical with
complainants.
The defendant in connection with its water did not intend
by the word Vichy, to defraud complainants, nor deceive the
public; it has never sold its water as, or for, complainant's
Vichy, nor in resemblance thereto, but all its water has been,
in proper manner, labelled and marked, so that the purchaser
shall know that the goods sold by the defendant is a natural
mineral water of Saratoga, and not the water of the complainants. Pope v. Hart, 35 Barb. (N. Y.) 630-636; Cortland v.

The word Vichy has become a generic name, with the significance stated, and the complainants have no trade-mark, or
trade name, therein, or any right to legal protection in the
exclusive use of it; a generic name, one merely descriptive of
an article, of its qualities, ingredients, or characteristics, cannot be employed as a trade-mark. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13

Complainants have been guilty of laches, they having stood
by and permitted the defendant to bild up a business, and
establish a good will that has become valuable, so that the
granting of present relief would wreck, and absorb to the complainants, a business, which it has permitted to become valuable
without complaint, and this is intolerable. If the complainants here have allowed the defendant to build up a profitable

business, on every fair principle, they should be estopped from
wrecking it. Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. Garner, 55 Barb. 151;

v. Pryor, 173 U. S. 38, distinguishing McLean v. Fleming, 96
U. S. 245.
Complainants cannot escape from this rule, because against
the French Republic, as a sovereign power, there is no prescription, and laches cannot be predicated upon any lapse of time.
The principle has no application here. When a foreign government comes into our courts, it stands, and must stand, on
the precise plane of a private litigant. No public policy demands anything different, and a holding as asked by the
appellants would be well nigh intolerable.
And the treaty between the French Republic and the United
States requires the same result. Compilation of Treaties in
Force, 1899, p. 684.
The French Republic has no interest in the controversy here,
is not a proper party to the record, and her presence on the
record, without interest and without right, cannot save the
case, in which only the appellant company has any interest,
from the result of the laches existing here.
There is no reason why the French Republic should be a
party, Kernochan v. N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., 128 N. Y. 559,
566; and as a nominal party it cannot save any rights to the
company. Maryland v. Baldwin, 112 U. S. 490; United States

MR. JusTIc, BiowN, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit is brought to vindicate the right of plaintiffs to the
exclusive use of the word "Vichy" as against the defendant,
and incidentally as against all persons making use of the word
to denote a water not drawn from the springs of Vichy, now
owned by the French Republic and leased to the Vichy Company.
The title of the French Republic to the springs of Vichy, a
commune of France, is clearly established. Known for their
medicinal qualities since the time of the Roman Empire and
originally belonging to the feudal lord of Vichy, they were sold
by him in 1444, together with the castle and its dependencies,
to Pierre, Duke of Bourbon, in whose family they remained
until 1531, when, for the treason of the Constable of Bourbon,
they were confiscated by Francis I, and became the property of
the crown, in whose possession they remained until 1790, when
they were united to the public domain and afterwards passed
to the French Republic and its successors, and were operated
directly by the officers of the state until june, 1853, when they

FRENCH REPUBLIC v. SARATยฃOGA VICHY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

were leased for a fixed rental to a firm of which the Vichy Company is the successor. The bottling and exportation of the
waters was commenced before 1716, and in 1853 they begun
to be exported directly to this country, the shipments in 1893
amounting to about 300,000 bottles. For many years they
have been bottled and sold all over the world.
The rights of the defendant originated from a spring discovered in 1872 in the township of Saratoga Springs, New York,
the waters of which, though differing from the water of the
Vichy Spring both in ingredients and taste, have a certain
resemblance to them which suggested the use of the word
"Vichy."
The water began to be bottled and sold in 1873 by
the owners of the spring, and in 1876 became the property of
the defendant, which has since sold the water, using various
bottles, circulars and labels, containing more or less conspicuously displayed the word "Vichy."
1. As the waters of Vichy had been known for centuries
under that name there is reason for saying the plaintiffs had
in 1872 acquired an exclusive right to the use of the word
"Vichy" as against every one whose waters were not drawn
from the springs of Vichy, or at least, as observed by a French
court, "from the same hydrographical region which may be
called generally the basin of Vichy."
True the name is geographical; but geographical names often
acquire a secondary signification indicative not only of the
place of manufacture or production, but of the name of the
manufacturer or producer and the excellence of the thing
manufactured or produced, which enables the owner to assert
an exclusive right to such name as against every one not doing
business within the same geographical limits; and even as
against them, if the name be used fraudulently for the purpose
of misleading buyers as to the actual origin of the thing produced, or of palming off the productions of one person as those
of another. Elgin National Watch "Co. v. Illinois Watch Co.,

Braham v. Beachim, 7 Ch. Div. 848; Thompson v. Montgomery,
41 Ch. Div. 35; Seixo v. Provezende, L. R. 1 Ch. App. 192.
In a French case arising in this connection, and brought by
the Vichy Company against a rival company owning two
springs in the same neighborhood, complaining that by the
composition of its name and the arrangement of its labels, as
well as by the tenor of its different appeals to the public, the
company owning these springs had created a damaging confusion between the two companies and their product, it was
held that, while the rival company had a right to the use of the
word "Vichy," it was bound to state the name of its springs,
the place where they were located as "near Vichy" in letters
identical in height and thickness as those of the word Vichy
in their advertisements and labels, and also the name of their
springs in letters at least half their size-in other words, it was
bound to adopt such precautions as would fully apprise the
public that it was not purporting to sell the waters of the
original Vichy Company, though being in the same basin, they
were entitled to use that designation.
2. A serious difficulty in the way of enforcing an exclusive
right on the part of the plaintiffs to the use of the word Vichy
is their apparent acquiescence in such use by others. For
thirty years the defendant, the Saratoga Vichy Company, has
been openly and notoriously bottling and selling its waters
under the name of the "Saratoga Vichy" until its competition
has become an extremely serious matter to the plaintiffs, whose
importations began in 1853 with only 316 bottles, which by the
year 1893 had increased to 298,500 bottles. The entire shipment of the Vichy Company amounted in 1896 to nearly ten
millions of bottles. Under such circumstances, and in view of
the further facts that other waters were openly manufactured
and sold in this country under the name of Vichy, and that a
manufactured water was dealt out by the glass under that
name in innumerable soda water fountains throughout the
country, as shown by the record in this case, it is impossible
to suppose that the plaintiffs were not aware of these infringe-

FRENCH REPUBLIC v. SARATOGA VICHY CO. 437
191 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

ments upon their exclusive rights. It argues much more than
ordinary indifference and inattention to suppose that the large
amount of this rival water could be advertised and sold all over
the country without the knowledge of their agents, who would
naturally be active in the protection of their own interests, if
not the interests of their principals. In fact, they had allowed
the name to become generic and indicative of the character of
the water. With all these facts before them, and with the
yearly increasing sales and competition of the defendant company, no move was made against them for twenty-five years,
and until 1898, when this bill was filed. A clearer case of
laches could hardly exist. Saxlehner v. Eisner, 179 U. S. 19, 36.
It is said, however, that the doctrine of laches has no application to the neglect of the government to pursue trespassers
upon its rights, and that the French Republic is entitled to the
benefit of that rule. It is at least open to doubt whether the
maxim nullum tempus, applicable to our own government, can
be invoked in behalf of a foreign government suing in our
courts. The doctrine is one of public policy, and is based upon
the assumption that the officers of the government may be so
busily engaged in the ordinary affairs of state as to neglect a
vindication of its interests in the courts. Whether this exemption can be set up by a foreign government in the prosecution
of suits against our own citizens-in other words, whether the
latter are not entitled to the benefit of the ordinary defences
at law, is a question which does not necessarily arise in this case,
and as to which we are not called upon to express an opinion.
However this may be, it is clear that the rule of nullum
tempus cannot be invoked in this case. While the French
Republic is nominally the plaintiff, its interest in the litigation
is little, if anything, more than nominal. For fifty years it
has ceased to operate these springs through its own agents,
since in 1853 the then Emperor of the French leased them to
the predecessors of the Vichy Company, which has since that
time bottled and sold the water under successive leases as its
own, upon the payment of an annual rental of 100,000 francs

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

191 U. S.

to the government. Its present lease does not expire until
1934. It thus appears that the French Republic has had no
real interest in the product of the springs for fifty years, and
that it can have no such interest for thirty years to come. Its
only title to sue, then, is in a possible depreciation of the rental
value of this property after the lapse of the present lease,
caused by the unlawful use of the name Vichy by the defendant. This is quite too inappreciable to answer the defence of
laches, and, indeed, it is doubtful whether it justifies its joinder
as co-plaintiff in the suit. To hold that the French Republic
appears in this litigation to be suing for the use and benefit of
the Vichy Company would more accurately describe their relations.
In such cases, either where the government is suing for the
use and benefit of an individual, or for the prosecution of a
private and proprietary instead of a public or governmental
right, it is clear that it is not entitled to the exemption of nullum
tempus, and that the ordinary rule of laches applies in full force.
United States v. Beebe, 127 U. S. 338; New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U. S. 76; Maryland v. Baldwin, 112 U. S. 490; United
States v. Des Moines &c. Co., 142 U. S. 510, 538; Curtner v.
United States, 149 U. S. 662; United States v. American Bell
Telephone Co., 167 U. S. 224, 264; Miller v. The State, 38
Alabama, 600; Moody v. Fleming, 4 Georgia, 115.
The plaintiffs, then, are put in this dilemma: If the Republic
be a necessary party to the suit here, as it sues in its private
and proprietary capacity, the defence of laches is available
against it. Upon the other hand, if it be an unnecessary party,
the defence of laches may certainly be set up against the Vichy
Company, its co-plaintiff.
We do not think the position of the plaintiffs in this connection
is affected or strengthened by the eighth article of the treaty of
June 11, 1887, with France and other nations, known as the Industrial Property Treaty, (Comp. of Treaties in Force 1899, 684,)
which declares that "the commercial name shall be protected
in all the countries of the Union without obligation of deposit,

Opinion of the Court.

whether it forms part or not, of a trade or commercial mark."
That article was evidently designed merely to protect the citizens of other countries in their right to a trade-mark or commercial name, and their right to sue in the courts of this'
country, as if they were citizens of the United States. It could
never have been intended'to put them on a more favorable
footing than our own citizens, or to exempt them from the
ordinary defences that might be made by the party prosecuting.
This is made the more apparent from Art. II of the treaty,
which reads as follows: "The subjects or citizens of each of the
contracting States shall enjoy, in all the other States of the
Union, so far as concerns patents for inventions, trade or commercial marks, and the commercial name, the advantages that
the respective laws thereof at present accord, or shall afterwards accord to citizens or subjects. In consequence they
shall have the same protection as these latter, and the same
legal recourse against all infringements of their rights, under
reserve of complying with the formalities and conditions imposed upon subjects or citizens by the domestic legislation of
each State."
If there were any doubt about the rights of the plaintiffs
under the eighth article they are completely removed by the
wording of the second. The rights of the French Republic are
the same, and no greater under this article than those of the
United States would be.
3. But conceding that the defence of laches would not be
available in a case of actual fraud, or an attempt to foist uponthe public the waters of the defendant as those of the orginal
Vichy spring, McIntire v. Pryor, 173 U. S.38; Saxlehner v.
Eisner&c.Co., 179 U. S.19; Prevost v. Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481, 497;
McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245; Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S.
514, we find but little evidence of such purpose in this record.
The two waters not only differ in their ingredients and taste,
but the French Vichy is a still, and the Saratoga Vichy, as well
as the other American Vichies, an effervescing, water. There
is no attempt made whatever by the defendant to simulate the

label of the plaintiffs upon the body of the bottle. The word
Vichy is never used by the defendant alone, but always in connection with Saratoga. The two labels not only differ wholly
in their design and contents, but even in their language, that
of the plaintiffs being wholly in French. Plaintiffs' label contains the word Vichy prominently displayed with a picture of
the thermal establishment where it is bottled, and the name of
the particular spring. Defendant's label contains the two
words, "Saratoga Vichy," in type of the same size and displayed
with equal prominence, and a statement that the Saratoga
Vichy is far superior to the imported Vichy. It is true that in
1896 a small label was attached to the neck of the bottle upon
which the name Vichy was more prominent than that of Saratoga. This label was printed upon a white background, with
the word Vichy in prominent red letters, while the word Saratoga appeared in much smaller black letters included between
the extended "V" and "Y" of the word Vichy. The Circuit
Court considered this to be immaterial, and thought it inconceivable that any one of ordinary perception could be induced
to buy this water as the imported Vichy. A majority of the
Court of Appeals, however, while agreeing with the Circuit
Court as to the total dissimilarity of the main labels, thought
a purchaser might be deceived by the neck label into buying
the Saratoga for the imported article, and in that particular
reversed the Circuit Court, and enjoined the use of the neck
label, or of any other label in which the place of the origin of
the water was not as plainly and as prominently made known
as the word Vichy. As the defendant did not apply for a
certiorari, and has acqfiiesced in the decree of the Circuit Court
of Appeals by changing the offending label, we are not called
upon to express an opinion as to the deceptive character of
this label. Hubbard v. Tod, 171 U. S. 474.
It was said by this court in Canal Companyv. Clark, 13 Wall.
311,322," In all cases where rights to the exclusive use of a trademark are invaded, it is invariably held that the essence of the
wrong consists in the sale of goods of one manufacturer or vendor

as those of another; and that it is only when this false representation is directly or indirectly made that the party who appeals
to a court of equity can have relief." Applying this doctrine
to the case under consideration we are clearly of the opinion
that there is no such similarity in the labels as at present used,
and that there is no such fraud shown in the conduct of the defendant as would authorize us to say that plaintiffs are entitled
to relief.
The decree of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.

NORFOLK AND WESTERN RAILWAY CO. v. SIMS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.
No. 74. Argued November 12, 1903.-Decided December 7,1903.
The States have no power to tax directly, or by license upon the importer,
goods imported from foreign countries or other States, while in their
original packages, or before they have become commingled with the general property of the State and lost their distinctive character as imports.
In cases not arising under the police power, where an article is made in one
State and shipped in its original package in pursuance of an order to a
person in another State, to be there delivered on payment of the agreed
price, the sale is actually made in the former State and the seller cannot
by reason of the delivery of the article and passing of the title of the
property in the latter State be subjected to a license tax imposed by it on
persons engaged in the sale of similar articles within that State.

THIS was a controversy between the sheriff of Person County,
North Carolina, on the one part, and the Railway Company
and Mrs. 0. L. Satterfield on the other, which might have been
the subject of a civil action, and which the parties agreed to
submit, under the code of North Carolina, to the judge of the
Superior Court upon the following facts, and upon the question
of the liability of the defendants for a license tax under section 52 of "An act to raise revenue," ratified March 15, 1901.
