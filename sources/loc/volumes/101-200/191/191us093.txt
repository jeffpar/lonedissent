rest on the government upon the whole evidence to satisfy the

for the construction or repair of the railway.
While the Supreme Court of New XNexico upon this second
writ of error may have considered itself bound by its decision
upon the question here involved upon the first writ as the law
of the case, we are not ourselves restrained by the same limitation. As its judgment upon the first writ was merely for a
reversal of the court below and for a new trial, such judgment, not being final, could not be made the subject of a writ
of error from this court. Upon the present writ, however, we
are at liberty to revise the action of the court below in both
instances.
There was error in requiring plaintiff to assume the burden
of showing that the timber was not cut for purposes of construction or repair, and
The judgment of the Supreme Court is therefore reversed,
and the case remanded to that court with instructionsto

He has an adequate remedy at law under the act, and so the
writ cannot be issued. In re Huguley Xfgj. Co., 184: U. S.

.A. Solicitor General Hoyt for the United States:
I. No case justifying a writ of prohibition is presented. The
decree in the test case authorized by the statute was self-executing, has had its full effect by operation of law, and is now
entirely beyond the control of the Citizenship Court. Prior
to the filing of this petition a certified copy was delivered to
the Dawes Commission.
Since filing his petition, the petitioner has transferred his
case, as provided by the act, from the United States court
having control of the same to the Citizenship Court, thus instituting the very proceedings which apparently he seeks by
prohibition to restrain. His real object, however, is to have
this court review and set aside the decree of the Citizenship
Court in the test case. A writ of prohibition cannot be used
to undo that which has been fully and finally completed. United &taes v. Hoffman, 4: Wall. 158, citing Hall v. .Norwood,
Siderfin, 166. A writ of prohibition cannot be made to serve
the office of a writ of error. E parte Ferry Co., 104 U. S.
519, 520.
U. The writ would obstruct the action of the political department of the Government. The Citizenship Court, like the
Dawes Commission, is a political agency established by Congress in furtherance of its declared purpose of extinguishing
the tribal title to lands in the Indian Territory, with a view
to the erection of a State-or States of the Union embracing
such lands. Act of March 3, 1893, 27 Stat. 645 ; Btephen 8 v.

administer upon and guard the tribal property has been declared by this court to be political and administrative in its

III. A prohibition cannot issue from this court "in cases
where there is no appellate power given by law, nor any special authority to issue the writ." Em parte Gordon, 1 Black,
503, 506; Foster's Fed. Prac. vol. 2, sec. 362. The "special
authority" of this court to issue writs of prohibition, :Rev.
Stat. see. 688, is limited to the District Courts of the United
States when sitting as courts of admiralty. E xarte Christy,
3 How. 293 ; Expazrte Gordon,1 Black, 503 ; Ex parteEaton,
95 U. S. 68; Exnyarte Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610. No appellate
power has been given "by law" to this court over the Citizenship Court whose judgments and decrees are final.
The Citizenship Court is not a "constitutional" but a "legislative" court, created by Congress in virtue of the general
sovereignty of the United States over all territory within its
limits, whether occupied by Indian tribes or not. American
1m. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 321 ; Uiited &ate v. Kagama, 118
U. S. 380. It is a special tribunal, created for a particular
purpose, and will expire by limitation at a certain time. Not
being a "constitutional" court, in which the judicial power of
the United States under the third article of the Constitution
may be vested, and, unlike the regular territorial courts, possessing no general law and equity jurisdiction, the question
whether this court can issue a writ of prohibition thereto in
the exercise of its "inherent general power" cannot arise. In

Section 716, Rev. Stat., confers no authority to issue the writ

IV. The act in question is constitutional. The history of
this legislation shows that it was passed by Congress, at the
solicitation and with the consent of the Indians concerned,
for the purpose of protecting them against fraud and wrong.
The argument that it is an attempt on the part of the legislative branch of the Government to disturb vested rights by setting aside the final decrees of a court of competent jurisdiction,
is fully answered by the opinion of the court in Stek ens v.
Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 478. See also Cherokee
.Vation v. Ritohooek and Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, above cited.
The decision in the St._plene case was confined entirely to a

Opinion of the Court.

determination of the constitutionality of the legislation of
Congress in respect to citizenship and the allotment of lands
in the Indian Territory. Assuming, without deterinining,
that the act of June 10, 1896, authorized the United States
courts to review de novo the cases appealed from the Dawes
Commission, the authority of Congress to authorize such a review was affirmed, and the legislation under consideration declared to be, in general, valid and constitutional. The question of notice was not even mentioned in the opinion in that
case. The act of July 1, 1902, therefore, which provides for
a specific inquiry by the Citizenship Court into the validity of
the methods of procedure adopted by the United States courts
in the citizenship cases appealed thereto from the Dawes
Conunission, and for a review of such cases upon their merits,
in no way disturbs the judgment in the Sephens case. It but
supplements the action of this court in that case, and merely
serves to complete the declared purpose to have "the very
right" of this controversy determined.
MR. JusTic. Hor.tns delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition for a writ of prohibition, and for a writ of
certiorari in aid of the same, to the members of the Choctaw
and Chickasaw Citizenship Court established by an agreement
between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw
Nations made on March 21, 1902, and ratified by an act of
Congress of July 1,1902, 32 Stat. 641, c. 1362. By § 31 of the
act the two nations were authorized to file a bill in equity in
the said court to annul, on certain grounds of law, decrees of
United States courts in the Indian Territory, whereby certain
persons were admitted to citizenship in those nations. The
bill was filed and a decree was made purporting to annul the
former decrees. The prohibition sought is against giving further effect to this decree or certifying and delivering a copy
of the same to the Dawes Commission, established under an
earlier act, it being alleged that the provisions of § 31 are contrary to the Constitution of the United States.
The facts alleged and not denied may be summed up as fol-

OTOBER TERU, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

lows: By the act of June 10, 1896, c. 398, 29 Stat. 321, 339,
Congress authorized a commission to the Five Civilized Tribes of
Indians commonly called the Dawes Commission, to hear and
determine the rights of persons claiming citizenship in any of
those nations, with an appeal to the United States courts in the
Territory. The petitioner applied to the commission, and, his
application being rejected, appealed to the United States court,
and there, on March 8, 1898, got a decree in his favor declaring
him to be a member of the Chickasaw Nation. A bill of review
brought by the Chickasaw Nation is pending in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Indian Territory. After the
decree, and before the act of 1902, and, for anything to the
contrary in the petition, before th6 decision of this court next
to be mentioned, the petitioner entered a tract of Chickasaw
land and made improvements costing fifteen thousand dollars.
For this he invokes the act of June 28, 1898, c. 517, § 161, 30
Stat. 495, 505, 507, and he contends that that act, as well as the
act of 1902, § 11, gave him a right of property in common
with the other members of the tribe. Jones v. .Meehan, 175
U. S. 1.
On July 1, '1898, an act of Congress granted an appeal from
such decrees to this court, c. 545, 30 Stat. 591, and an appeal
was taken by the Chickasaw Nation. In May, 1899, it was
held by this court that the act was intended to open only the
question of the constitutionality of the previous legislation,
which was sustained, and that the act of July 1, 1898, was not
made invalid by the provision in the earlier statute of 1896
that the judgment of the United States courts on appeal to
them should be final. Steykewn v. Cherokee .Nation,174 U. S.
445.
The Indian nations, still being dissatisfied, there followed
the agreement and the act of 1902 first mentioned in this statement. By § 33 the Choctaw and Chickasaw Citizenship Court
was created. By § 32 it was given appellate jurisdiction over
all judgments of the courts in the Indian Territory rendered
under the above-mentioned act of 1896, admitting persons to
citizenship or to enrollment as citizens in any of the said
nations. It is admitted that these sections are valid, but it is

-

Opinion of the Court.

contended that § 31, upon which the decree rests, is void. By
that section it is provided that the Choctaw and Chickasaw
Nations may file a bill in the new court to annul all the said
judgments or decrees of the United States courts, on the
ground that notice should have been given to both nations,
whereas it was given only to one, or on the ground that the
proceedings should have been confined to a review of the action of the Dawes Commission on the evidence submitted to
that commission, and should not have extended to a trial de
novo of the question of citizenship. The suit was to be confined to a determination of these questions of law. In case
the judgment or decrees should be annulled, parties deprived
of citizenship were empowered to transfer the proceedings in
their cases to the Citizenship Court for such proceedings as
ought to have been had in the United States courts. Several
thousand persons being concerned, ten persons admitted to citizenship were to be made defendants and served with process,
and there was to be a general notice, also, by publication, with
liberty to any person so situated to become a party. A bill
was filed, and after proceedings in conformity to the statute a
decree was rendered annulling all the said judgments or decrees on both the above grounds.
The answer set up that the test case provided for had been
decided and judgment entered and certified to the Dawes Commission on January 15, 1903, before the present petition was
filed, and that nothing remained to be done bythe Citizenship
Court. It also alleged as an estoppel that, since filing this
petition, this petitioner has instituted a suit by way of appeal,
as provided in the act of 1902, to have his rights tried by the
court on their merits, and further, that if the petitioner is an
Indian he is bound by the vote of his tribe ratifying the agreement sanctioned by said act of 1902. To this answer the petitioner demurred, so that, whether a demurrer was necessary
or not, the allegations of the answer are not denied.
On these facts the petitioner contends that § 31 is void because it provides for a personal judgment, the annulling of the
decree obtained by him, without personal service, because Congress has no power to annul or to provide for the annulling of

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction not alleged to
have been obtained by fraud, and because the annulling of the
judgment deprives the petitioner of property rights without
due process of law.
It is unnecessary to state the objections to the law more in
detail, because we are of opinion that the writ must be denied
irrespective of these questions. We need not consider whether
the jurisdiction of this court to grant a writ of prohibition to
the District Courts is confined to cases where those courts are
"proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."

Court is a court in such a sense as to be subject to prohibition.
See In re 7"idal,179 U. S. 126; Gordon v. United States,
2 Wall. 561; S. C. 117 U. S. 697, 702. However these things
may be, it is clear that the writ will not issue after the cause
is ended, and that the cause in the Citizenship Court was ended
before the present application was heard.
It is stated correctly by the answer that the act does not
empower the Citizenship Court to do anything in the test case
beyond rendering its judgment and certifying the same, as it
has done. This being so, there is nothing which this court
could prohibit, even if it were of opinion that the petitioner
made out a good case on the merits, which we do not intimate.
Therefore the writ must be denied. United States v. Hofiman,
