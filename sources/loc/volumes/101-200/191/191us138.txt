SMITH v. INDIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 81. Argued October 22, 23, 1903.-Decided November 16, 1903.
The extent of the power of a public officer to question the constitutionality
of a state statute as an excuse for refusing to enforce it is purely a local
question. Huntington v. Worthen, 120 U. S. 101.
The jurisdiction of this court can only be invoked by a party having a personal interest in the litigation.
Where a public officer of a State who has no interest in the controversy except as such officer tests the constitutionality of a state statute purely in
the interests of third parties, by a suit in the state courts and a judgment has been rendered against him by the highest court of the State, a
writ of error from this court to revise such judgment will not lie.
The fact that costs were rendered against him personally in the state court
will not give this court jurisdiction in such case.

THIS was a petition filed in the Circuit Court of Marion County
by the Stat6, upon the relation of Martha and Benjamin Lewis,
against the auditor of Marion County for a writ of mandamus
to compel the defendant, in his official capacity, to allow an
exemption of a mortgage of $500 upon a lot of land in Indianapolis owned by the relators, and that the same be deducted
from the value of such lot.
The petition was based upon an act passed by the General
Assembly March 4, 1899, the first section of which declares:
"That any person being the owner of real estate liable for taxation within the State of Indiana, and being indebted in any
sum, secured by mortgage upon real estate, may have the
amount of such mortgage indebtedness, not exceeding seven
hundred dollars, existing and unpaid upon the first day of

SITH v. INDIANA.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

April of any year, deducted from the assessed valuation of
mortgage premises for that year, and the amount of such valuation remaining after such deduction shall have been made
shall form the basis for assessment and taxation for said real
estate for said year."
An alternative writ having been issued, defendant interposed a general demurrer, which was sustained by the court,
and the relators declining to plead further, judgment was entered against them:
Upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the action of the court
below was reversed, the law held to be constitutional and the
cause remanded. 158 Indiana, 543. Thereupon the defendant made formal return to the writ alleging the unconstitutionality of the act, both under the State and Federal Constitutions, to which relators demurred. The demurrer was sustained, and a judgment entered for a peremptory mandamus
commanding the defendant to allow the exemption, and to
deduct from the assessed valuation of the real estate the amount
of the mortgage, $500, and also that relators recover from the
defendant their costs, which, however, appear never to have
been taxed. This judgment was subsequently affirmed by the
Supreme Court upon the authority of its opinion upon the
previous appeal, and a writ of error sued out from this court.
Mr. Horace E. Smith, with whom Mr. Roscoe 0. Hawkins
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
There is a Federal question; the Constitution of the United
States guarantees to each and every citizen the equal protection
of the laws, and prohibits any State from making or enforcing
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States, or which deprives them of life,
liberty or property, without due process of law, or which denies
to any citizen within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
law. 14th Amendment, U. S. Const.
This provision applies to and covers all questions of unequal
taxation. Railroad Tax Cases, 13 Fed. Rep. 722, 732; Nash-

McConway, 82 Fed. Rep. 257; Davenport v. Cloverport, 72 Fed.
Rep. 689; Myers v. Shields, 61 Fed. Rep. 713.
The laws require, therefore: 1. That the General Assembly
shall provide a law for assessment and taxation; 2. That the
law must provide for a uniform and equal rate of assessment
and taxation; 3. That such law shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure a just valuation, for taxation, for all propeity, both real and personal; 4. Excepting such only for (a) municipal, (b) educational, (c) literary, (d) scientific, (e) religious,
or (f) charitable purposes, as may be exempted by law, but
the provision in the Constitution that "all property, both real
and personal," shall be taxed, precludes exemption by the
Legislature of any property from taxation. Indianapolis v.

If the constitutional provision by its terms permits exemption, then, within the limits of its provisions, exemptions may
be made by law, by the Legislature, but no exemption can be
made outside of the limits specified. State ex rel. Tieman v.

ex rel. Tiernan v. Indianapolis,69 Indiana, 375; 25 Am. & Eng.
Eno. Law, pp. 166, note, 167, 168.
The act violates both the Constitution of the State of
Indiana and the Fourteenth Amendment: 1. The lack of constitutional uniformity and equality in the rate of assessment
and taxation; 2. It is a special law for the assessment of taxes
for state, county, township and road purposes; 3. It grants to
one class of citizens privileges and immunities which, upon the
same terms, will not equally apply to all citizens; 4. It exempts
from taxation realty not held for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes.
This method of valuation is illegal and in violation of the
Constitution and rules laid down by the courts. Cooley's

Indiana, 513; Willis v. Crowder, 134 Indiana, 515.
The law is special and violative of sec. 2, art. IV, of the state
constitution as it discriminates against unincumbered real estate. There is no separate estate in lands mortgaged created
by the mortgage. A mortgage conveys no estate in the lands
mortgaged, but simply creates a lien. See. 1099, Burns, 1901;
Reasoner v. Edmunson, 5 Indiana, 393; Francis v. Porter, 7

coming within the classes privileged by the state constitution.

The granting of the deduction is the equivalent of giving of
a credit for so much tax or the drawing of a warrant and
whether the officer has a personal interest in the question, or
if the nature of the office is such as to require him to raise it,
he may make defense and it is his duty to do so. Denman v.

Upon the question of whether a ministerial officer can defend a mandamus case on the ground of the unconstitutionality
of a law the cases are in irreconcilable conflict. 19 Enc. Law,
p. 764. It is always a question of the particular case. People,
ex rel. v. Salomon, 54 Illinois, 39, is not a mandamus case at all,
but a case involving a contempt proceeding. But, admitting
it so holds, yet in People v. Salomon, 46 Illinois, 333; People v.
Miner, 46 Illinois, 384; Madison Co. v. People, 58 Illinois, 456;
People v. Thompson, 155 Illinois, 451, exactly the opposite
doctrine was held.
Franklin Co. v. State ex rel., 24 Florida, 55, is exactly contrary to McConihe v. State, 17 Florida, 238, and State v. Hooker,
36 Florida, 358. The State cites twelve cases from eight States,
but of these eight States five have also decided the same question the other way; these are Louisiana, Illinois, Nebraska,
West Virginia and Florida. The Illinois and Florida cases are
cited above. The others are: State v. New Orleans, 42 La. Ann.
92; State v. Judge, 5 La. Ann. 756; State v. Moore, 40 Nebraska,

The true doctrine is that every case stands upon its own
facts. Here the auditor, a public officer, is in the attitude of
defending the public revenue against dissipation and unlawful credit under an unconstitutional law. This is a case where
the auditor not only may but must defend, and upon this very
ground.

under, the United States, that title or right must be one of the
plaintiff in error, and not of a third person only. Owings v.

any just cause for complaint.
A ministerial officer cannot adjudge a law unconstitutional
on the ground that it may affect the rights of others, and refuse to perform his plain duties thereunder, and excuse

highest judicial body of his state to be a valid law for his guidance and authority.
The only question before this court is whether said act is
repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal constitution, and it is clear that it does not abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States, or deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law,
or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.
The State may distinguish, select and classify objects of
legislation, and necessarily this power must have a wide range
of discretion. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & S. Bank, 170 U. S.

As to uniformity the state court said that the act in question purports to be a law that is uniform throughout the State,
and, as it permits all persons to take advantage of it when their
circumstances bring them within its operation, it does not
violate that requirement of the constitution. Cleveland, etc.,

Opinion of the Court

191 U. S.

MR. JTusTIcr BROWN, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The constitutionality of the exemption law of Indiana was
apparently the only question raised by the parties. It was
argued elaborately, both in the Circuit and Supreme Court of
the State, and was finally affirmed by a majority of the latter
court. The power of the county auditor, who is charged by
law with the duty of making the assessment, to refuse to allow
the relators their exemption upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the act, does not appear to have been raised in the
state courts, and is not noticed in either opinion of the Supreme
Court. In fact, the celerity of the proceedings and the admissions of counsel indicate that the suit was begun and carried on for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the
law, and that the litigation was at least not an unfriendly one.
We have no doubt of the power of state courts to assume
jurisdiction of the case if they choose to do so, although there
are many authorities to the effect thast a ministerial officer,
charged by law with the duty of enforcing a certain statute,
cannot refuse to perform his plain duty thereunder upon the
ground that in his opinion it is repugnant to the Constitution.
It is but just to say, however, that the power of a public
officer to question the constitutionality of a statute as an excuse for refusing to enforce it has often been assumed, and
sometimes directly decided, to exist. In any event, it is a
purely local question, and seems to have been so treated by
this court in Huntington v. Worthen, 120 U. S. 97, 101.
Different considerations, however, apply to the jurisdiction
of this court, which we have recently held can only be invoked
by a party having a personal interest in the litigation. It
follows that he cannot sue out a writ of error in behalf of third
persons. Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U. S.

control the present case. It is evident that the auditor had no
personal interest in the litigation. He had certain duties as a
public officer to perform. The performance of those duties
was of no personal benefit to him. Their non-performance was
equally so. He neither gained nor lost anything by invoking
the advice of the Supreme Court as to the proper action he
should take. He was testing the constitutionality of the law
purely in the interest of third persons, viz., the taxpayers, and
in this particular the case is analogous to that of Caffrey v.
Oklahoma, 177 U. S. 346. We think the interest of an appellant in this court should be a personal and not an official interest, and that the defendant, having sought the advice of
the courts of his own State in his official capacity, should be
content to abide by their decision.
It is true there seems to have been a personal judgment in
form against the defendant for costs, the amount of which,
however, has never been taxed, and when taxed and paid
would probably be reimbursed to him. It was formerly held,
under the practice which disqualified interested witnesses,
that a liability for costs was sufficient to render a witness incompetent. 1 Greenl. Ev. sees. 401, 402. But it seems to
be well settled that even if the fact that costs are awarded
against a party, gives him an appealable interest, of which
there appears to be considerable doubt, Travis v. Waters,
12 Johns. 500; Reid v. Vanderheyden, 5 Cow. 719, 736, it does
not give him an appealable interest in the judgment upon the
merits, but limits him to the mere question of costs. Studabaker v. Markley, 7 Ind. App. 368; Hone v. Schaick, 7 Paige,
221; Card v. Bird, 10 Paige, 426; Cuyler v. Moreland, 6 Paige,
273. If plaintiff in error objected to this judgment for costs
he might have moved to modify it in that particular. Not
having done so, his appeal is presumptively from the judgment on the merits, American Ins. Co. v. Gibson, 104 Indiana,
336, 342, and as his individual rights were not affected by such
judgment, he is not entitled to an appeal.
The fact that the various statutes fixing the jurisdiction of

the Circuit Courts of the United States, and of this court, which
from the original Judiciary Act of 1789 have, where the amount
involved was made the test of jurisdiction, uniformly used the
words "exclusive of costs," would indicate, so far as the Federal courts are concerned, that a mere judgment for costs could
not ordinarily be made the basis of an appeal to this court.
For the reasons above given, the appellant did not have the
requisite interest to maintain this appeal, and it is therefore
Dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JuSTiCE WHITE are of opin-

ion that the plaintiff in error was entitled to prosecute the present writ, and that the court should determine the case upon its
merits.

Ftestraints upon governmental agencies will not be readily implied. There
are presumptions against the granting of exclusive rights and against
limitations upon the powers of government.
By the statute of 1891, cities in Missouri may erect and operate their own
electric light plants, or they may grant the right to persons or corporations to erect and operate such plants for not exceeding a period of twenty
years. The city of Joplin by ordinance adopted subsequent to the statute, granted such right for twenty years to a corporation which erected
and has ever since operated the plant. The ordinance conferred rights,
exacted obligations, fixed rates and provided for its written acceptance
and the corporation so accepted it. By a later ordinance the city provided for the issue of bonds to build its own plant.
In an action brought by the Light Company to restrain the erection of the
plant during the continuance of the twenty year term, on the ground that
the ordinance violated the Federal constitution in that it impaired the obligation of the contract existing under the ordinance granting the franchise.
