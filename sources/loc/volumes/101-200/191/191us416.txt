GUARANTY CO. v. PRESSED BRICK CO.,
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
.
No. 39. Argued October 30,1903.-Decided December?, 1907
The taking by a materialman of thirty and sixty day notes for materials supplied to one contracting with the Government and who had
,given the bond of a surety company in pursuance of the act of August
13, 1894, 28 Stat. 278, to the effect, among other things that he would
"promptly make payment to all persons supplying him labor or materials" will not necessarily relieve the surety company from obligation
under the ordinary rule that exonerates a guarantor in case the time
fixed for performance of the contract by the principal be extended
without his consent, where it does not appear that such extension was
unreasonable, or that the surety was prejudiced thereby.

Tins was an action originally begun in the Circuit Court for
the District of Colorado by the United States, for the use and
benefit of the Golden Pressed and Fire Brick Company, (hereinafter called the Brick Company,) against John A. McIntyre
and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, (hereinafter termed the Guaranty Company,) upon a bond executed
April 11, 1898, in pursuance of an act of Congress of August 13,
,'1894, 28 Stat. 278, c. 280, to secure the performance of a con2 ract theretofore entered into by McIntyre with the Secretary
of the Treasury to furnish all the labor and materials and do
all the work required for the foundation and superstructure of
a mint in the city of Denver.
The questions certified are founded upon the following facts:
McIntyre, having agreed to erect the building, executed a bond
to the United States, with the Guaranty Company as surety,
conditioned not only upon the faithful performance of his work
to erect the building according to his contract, and to any
changes or additions made thereto, but to "promptly make
payment to all persons supplying him labor or material in

States, for the use and benefit, etc., of the Golden Pressed and Fire Brick
Company.

Statement of the Case.

the prosecution of the work contemplated by said contract."
During the progress of the work the Brick Company furnished
the contractor brick for the construction of the building to the
amount of $6517.55, which had been reduced by payments to
$2711.65, for which the action was brought.
The defendant denied its liability upon the ground that on
October 1, 1898, the Brick Company, without the knowledge
or consent of the Guaranty Company, granted to McIntyre an
extension of the time of payment of the balance then due on
account of the purchase price of such brick, and accepted two
promissory notes, one for thirty days after date, (October 1,)
and another sixty days after September 15, 1898, the first one
of which was paid. There was no allegation that, by reason
of the extension of the time of payment of the sum so due on
October 1, the Guaranty Company had sustained any loss or
injury, but it was insisted that it was nevertheless thereby
released and discharged from any further liability upon such
bond.
The Circuit Court held that the extension 'did not operate
to discharge the Guaranty Company from its liability, and the
Circuit Court of Appeals, to which the case was carried, certified to this court the following questions of law arising from
these facts:
"First. Did the action of the Brick Company on October 1,
1898, in taking two promissory notes, one for the sum of $1,275
and the other for the sum of $2,508.10, for the amount of the
Brick Company's account, then due and payable, one of said
notes running for thirty days and the other for sixty days, and
each bearing ten per cent interest per annum from date, operate
to discharge the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company
from its liability, assumed under the provisions of the aforesaid
bond, to pay to the Golden Pressed & Fire Brick Company the
amount of said indebtedness?
"Second. Did the extension of the time of payment of the
balance due from said McIntyre, on October 1, 1898, by the
taking of two notes in the manner and form aforesaid, operate

to discharge the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company
of its liability to pay the amount of said indebtedness to the
Brick Company, irrespective of the question whether said
Guaranty Company did or did not sustain an actual loss or
damage on account of such extension?"
Mr. Andrew W. Gillette for plaintiff in error.
The obligation of the plaintiff in error is that of suretyship,
and in determining its liability to the Brick Company the rules
of law applicable to contracts of suretyship in general are to be
applied. United States v. Am. Bonding and Trust Co., 32 C. C.
A. 420; 89 Fed. Rep. 925, 929; United States v. McIntyre, 111
Fed. Rep. 590, 597. The terms and extent of this obligation
are to be ascertained by reading the bond in the light of the
contract between McIntyre and the Brick Company. The bond
alone does not contain all the surety's contract with the Brick
Company. Brown v. Markland, 22 Ind. App. 652; 53 N. E.
Rep. 295, and cases cited; Ulster County Savings Inst. v. Young,

The statutory bond in suit imposes upon the surety a dual
obligation: (1) to the government, for the completion of the
principal contract; (2) to laborers and materialmen, to see that
they are promptly paid. These obligations are entirely separate and distinct. United States &c. v. Nat. Surety Co., 34 C.

Mr. T. J. O'Donnell for defendant in error:
We contend that the obligation assumed by these so-called
guaranty and surety companies, in cases of this kind, is that of
insurers and that they should be and are being so treated by
the courts, and that the law which governs those who for a
premium paid assume a possible risk should be applied to them,
Tather than that they should be deemed "favorites of the law,"
a term used (somewhat unhappily perhaps) with respect to
that social surety, who from motives of kindness and friendship,
without interest in the profit and without consideration, voluntarily assume liability for the performance of contracts by,
and possible faults of, neighbors and friends. See United States

It is not attempted to be set forth in the certificate that the
notes were taken in payment of the debt, and it will not be
so presumed. A certificate of this kind is the same as with
respect to the pleadings, with which the rule is that the pleading must definitely aver that the plaintiff accepted the notes in
settlement, satisfaction and discharge of the debt. Homas v.

This act gave by the bond a substitute for security given by
the lien law on private buildings. Surety companies are to be

Mh ..JusTicB BRowN, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

Thisbond was given in pursuance of the act of 1894, 28 Stat.
278, c. 280, "for the protection of persons furnishing materials
and labor for the construction of public works." The act

GUARANTY CO. v. PRESSED BRICK CO.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

requires, in substance, that persons contracting with the United
States for the construction of any public building, etc., shall
be required, before commencing such work, to execute the
usual penal bond, "with the additional obligations that such
contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to
all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials
in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract,"
with a right on the part of the materialman to bring suit in the
name of the United States for his use and benefit against the
contractor and his sureties. The bond in this case contained
two entirely distinct and separate obligations: First, that
McIntyre should fulfill all the conditions and covenants of
his contract, whatever changes in or additions to such contract might thereafter be made; and, second, promptly make
payment to all persons supplying him labor and materials in
the prosecution of the work. Of course, these covenants are
to be read together and the latter interpreted in the light of
the former.
The question involved is whether the ordinary rule that
exonerates the guarantor, in case the time fixed for the performance of the contract by the principal be extended, applies
to a bond of this kind executed by a Guaranty Company, not
only for a faithful performance of the original contract, but
for the payment of the debts of the principal obligor to third
parties. It is conceded that, by the general law of suretyship,
any change whatever in the contract for the performance of
which the guarantor is liable, made without his consent, such,
for instance, as an extension of time for payment, if made upon
sufficient consideration, discharges the guarantor from liability.
Miller v. Stewart, 9 Wheat. 680; Smith v. United States, 2 Wall.
219; Reese v. United States, 9 Wall. 13.
Counsel for the Brick Company argued with much persuasiveness that this rule of strictissimi juris, though universally
accepted as applicable to the undertaking of an ordinary guarantor, who is usually moved to lend his signature by motives
of friendship or expectation of reciprocity, andwithoutpecun-

iary consideration, has no application to the Guaranty
Companies, recently created, which undertake, upon the payment of a stipulated compensation and as a strictly business
enterprise, to indemnify or insure the obligee in the bond
against any failure of the obligor to perform his contract. It
is, at least, open to doubt, however, whether any relaxation
of the rule should be permitted as between the obligee and
the guarantor, which may have signed the guaranty in reliance
upon the rule of strictissimijuris, and with the understanding
that it is entitled to the ordinary protection accorded to guarantors against changes in the contract or extensions of the time
of payment. The government wisely protects itself in these
cases by providing in the bond that the obligation of the surety
shall extend to all changes in or additions to the contract,
which may thereafter be made-a clause which we have held
extends to such changes as might be found advantageous or
necessary in the plans or specifications, but does not extend
to a change in the location of the structure to be built. United
States v. Freel, 186 U. S. 309. But no provision was made in the
bond in that case with respect to the obligation of the principal
and his sureti to make payment to all persons supplying labor
or material to the contractor in the prosecution of his work.
We do not, however, deem it necessary to express an opinion
upon this subject, as we prefer to rest our decision upon the
perculiar character of the covenant upon which this action is
brought. In an ordinary guaranty the guarantor understands
perfectly the nature and extent of his obligation. If he becomes surety for the performance of a building contract, he is
presumed to know the parties, the terms of their undertaking,
the extent and feasibility of the work to be done, the character
and responsibility of the principal obligor, and his ability to
carry out the contract. If he guarantees the payment of a
particular debt, he usually knows the exact amount of the
debt, the time when it matures, and something of the ability
of the principal to meet it. If he becomes responsible for the
payment of the principal's debts generally, or lends his credit

GUARANTY CO. v. PRESSED BRICK CO.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to a proposed purchaser of goods, he knows the amount of his
liability and the means of his principal to meet them. In
such cases he contracts in reliance upon the exact terms of his
principal's undertaking, and has a right to suppose that no
change will be made without his consent; and the courts have
gone so far as to hold that any change will exonerate him,
though it really redound to his benefit.
This covenant, however, is inserted for an entirely different
purpose from that of securing to the government the performance of the contract for the construction of the building.
Inasmuch as neither the contractor nor his sub-contractors can
secure themselves by a mechanic's lienupon the proposed building, the government, solely for the protection of the latter, requires a covenant for the prompt payment of their claims, and
the same security that it requires for the performance of the
principal contract. In this covenant the surety guarantees
nothing to the principal obligee-the government-though the
latter permits an action upon the bond for the benefit of the
sub-contractors. The covenant is made solely for their benefit.
The guarantor is ignorant of the parties with whom his principal
may contract, the amount, the nature, and the value of the
materials required, as well as the time when payment for them
will become due. These particulars it would probably be impossible even for the principal to furnish, and it is to be assumed
that the surety contracts with knowledge of this fact. Not
knowing when or by whom these materials will be supplied, or
when the bills for them will mature, it can make no difference
to him whether they were originally purchased on a credit of
sixty days, or whether, after the materials are furnished, the
time for payment is extended sixty days, and a note given for
the amount maturing at that time. If a person deliberately
contracts for an uncertain liability he ought not to complain
when that uncertainty becomes certain.
Stress is laid upon the fact that the defendant company
guaranteed that the principal obligor should "promptly" make
payment to his materialmen, and that this, properly inter-

191 U. S.

preted, required that the contractor should pay at once upon
the maturity of the bills, and that as such bills became due
October 1, 1898, the promptness guaranteed required their
immediate payment. We are not impressed with ihe force of
this contention. If the word "promptly" has any particular
significance in this connection, it is satisfied by such payment
as the sub-contractor shall accept as having been promptly
made; or perhaps it was intended to give him an immediate
action upon the bond, in case such payment be not made with
sufficient promptness. It was not intended, however, that
the want of an immediate payment should be set up as a defence by the surety. As these bills are rarely paid the very
day they become due, the narrow construction claimed would
destroy the principal value of the security.
The facts of this case do not call for an expression of opinion
as to whether, if an unusual credit were given, and in the meantime the principal obligor had become insolvent, or the surety
were otherwise damnified by the delay, it might not be exonerated; since neither of these contingencies supervened in this
case, we are remitted to the naked proposition whether the
giving of a customary credit, with no evidence of loss thereby
occasioned, is sufficient to discharge the surety. We find no
difficulty whatever in answering this question in the negative.
The rule of strictissimifuris is a stringent one, and is liable at
times to work a practical injustice. It is one which ought not
to be extended to contracts not within the reason of the rule,
particularly when the bond is underwritten by a corporation,
which has undertaken for a profit to insure the obligee against
a failure of performance on the part of the principal obligor.
Such a contract should be interpreted liberally in favor of the
sub-contractor, with a view of furthering the beneficent object
of the statute. Of course, this rule would not extend to cases
of fraud or unfair dealing on the part of a sub-contractor, as
was the case in United States v. American Bonding & Trust Co.,
89 Fed. Rep. 921, 925, or to cases not otherwise within the
scope of the undertaking.
