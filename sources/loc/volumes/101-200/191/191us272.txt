PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. MIARYE.
APPEAL FRO

THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 24. Argued October 14, 1, 1903.-Decided November 30, 1903.
This court will follow the ruling of the highest court of a State when it has
held that a state statute does not violate the constitution of that State.
While a State may only tax shares of a national bank in accordance with the
Federal statute, a state law, which does not give the shareholders the benefit of all deductions to which they are entitled, is not necessarily void
altogether but may be sustained as to the amount properly taxable.
The mere lack of a provision in a tax law for notice does not take away the
jurisdiction of the taxing officer to make an assessment under any circumstances. It the tax could be imposed for a certain amount it is not void
but at most voidable for the legal amount, if any.
Where the amount of the tax which shareholders should pay if all the deductions they claimed were allowed, is ascertainable, neither they, nor the
bank itself on their behalf, can maintain an action in equity to restrain
the collection of the entire tax. They should, under the rule that he who
seeks the interposition of a court in equity, must himself do equity, first
offer to pay that part of thetax which under their contention is not
illegal.

THIS is an appeal, by the bank as complainant below, from
a decree of the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia, dismissing its bill with costs. 107 Fed.
Rep. 570.
The complainant and three other national banks in Lynchburg, Virginia, each commenced a suit in the above-named
court, against the auditor of public accounts of the State, to
restrain the collection of certain taxes assessed upon the share
owners of stock in the several banks, on the ground that such
taxes were illegally laid. This .particular complainant has
brought the case here by appeal as a test case, the same questions arising in all the others.
It is insisted upon the part of complainant that the laws
under which these taxes were levied are unconstitutional and

Statement of the Case.

void, and the prayer of the bill is that the stockholders may
be relieved and discharged from all liability on account of
such unpaid taxes.
The original bill, which was filed July 22, 1896, seeks to
enjoin the collection of taxes upon the stock of the shareholders
in the complainant bank for the years 1891 to 1895, both inclusive, and a preliminary injunction order to that effect was
granted. After the filing of the original bill and on February 10,
1900, a supplemental bill was filed by leave of the court, and it
was therein sought to enjoin the collection of all taxes for the
years 1891 to 1897, both inclusive.
Both bills were demurred to and the Circuit Court sustained
the demirrers and dismissed the bills.
It was averred in the bills that the acts of the legislature of
Virginia providing for the taxation of bank shares, both in
national and state banks, were in violation of the Federal
Constitution, as well as that of Virginia, and were also in violation of the act of Congress, Rev. Stat. sec. 5219, providing for the
taxation of shares of national bank stock under state authority.
The taxes referred to in the original bill were levied under
the act of Virginia passed March 6, 1890. Acts of Virginia
Assembly, 1890, p. 205, c. 244, sec. 17. That act prohibited
any assessment upon the capital stock of banks, either state
or national, and provided for assessing the stockholders on
their shares in those banks upon the market value thereof, at
the same rate as is assessed upon other moneyed capital in
"the hands of individuals residing in the State. It will be
observed that this rate of assessment is the condition upon
which Congress, in the section of the Revised Statutes above
mentioned, permits the taxation of national banks by or under
state authority.
Under this Virginia act it was further made the duty of the
banks to pay the amomt of the tax, and if a bank failed to pay
the same, its cashier and his sureties were made liable for the
tax and twenty per centum in addition to be iecovered by the
auditor of public accounts upon notice.

Statement of the Case.

An assessment upon the real estate of the bank was also to
be made against the bank itself for the same taxes as other
real estate was assessed for. The ground of the alleged illegality of the taxes is stated to be the want of any provision for
notice of time and place of valuation of the shares in arriving
at market value, and the failure to provide for deducting the
value of real estate from such market value, and also the failure
to permit deductions for the debts of the shareholders.
The taxes spoken of in the original bill (1891-1895) were not
paid, and no proceedings seem to have ever been taken to
enforce their collection under that act against the cashier or
his sureties. It might be surmised that they were not taken
because of a doubt as to the constitutionality of that part of
the act which provided for the liability of the cashier and his
sureties, if the bank failed to pay the tax assessed upon its
shareholders. However that may be, the authorities did not,
in fact, take any proceedings to enforce the payment of the
taxes until the passage of the act of March 3, 1896. Acts of
Assembly of Virginia, 1896, c. 642, p. 700. That act provided
a procedure for the collection of the taxes theretofore assessed
against the stockholders of banks and then remaining unpaid.
By its provisions the taxes were made a first lien upon the
stock, no matter in whose hands found, and it was made the
duty of the auditor of public accounts immediately to furnish
the cashiers of banks with a list of their stockholders theretofore
assessed with taxes upon their bank stock and who had not
paid the same, and each bank so desiring and electing was authorized to pay to the auditor the taxes assessed upon the
stock held by its stockholders, provided payment was made
before the first day of July, 1896. If the bank did not choose
to make such payment, it was made the duty of the auditor
to give a copy of the lists to the attorney general, and it was
made his duty to proceed by motion to collect the taxes from
the individual stockholders. The motion was to be cognizable
in the Circuit Court of Richmond city, after ten days' notice
to the stockholder, and might be served upon non-resident

defendants in the mode provided by section 3208 of the Virginia code.
By the supplemental bill the taxes for the years 1896-1897
were brought under review and a perpetual injunction was
asked to restrain the collection of all taxes from 1891 to and
including 1897. The assessments for the years 1896-1897 were
assessed under another act of the legislature of Virginia, which
was also passed March 3, 1896. Acts General Assembly of
Virginia, 1895-1896, p. 726. The seventeenth section of that
act provided for assessments upon the shares of state and national banks at the market value of the shares of stock held in
the banks at the same rate that is assessed upon other moneyed
capital in the hands of individuals residing in the State. The
act provided, also, that the banks should make a report on the
first day of February in each year, in which should be given
the names of the shareholders, the number of shares owned
or held or controlled by each, the market value of the stock,
and the shareholders' residences, and it was then made the
duty of the commissioner of revenue, on or after the first day
of February in each year, to assess each stockholder upon the
shares of stock held or owned by him at the market value, on
the first day of February in each year, as therein stated. The
section then provided for the retention of all the dividends by
the bank, and for the application of the same to the payment
of the tax assessed upon such stockholders, and that each bank
might, if it so elected, pay the tax so assessed against the stockholders directly to the auditor of public accounts before the
first day of June in each year.
Provision was then made that if the bank failed to make
such payment, the auditor of public accounts was to transmit
a copy of the assessment list furnished him by the commissioner of revenue, and it was made the duty of the treasurer
to collect the tax therein levied, and to that end to levy upon
the stock of the taxpayer.
Other provisions were made in regard to the transferring
of the stock to the purchaser at the sale upon the levy made

by the treasurer, and penalties were denounced upon the bank
for a refusal to comply with its provisions.
Soon after the passage of the acts of March 3, 1896, the
public authorities were about to take proceedings for the purpose of enforcing the collection and payment of the taxes for
the years mentioned, and thereupon this suit was brought and
a preliminary injunction obtained restraining the collection
of all taxes for those years upon the bank shares until the
further order of the court.
The shareholders in these four banks in the city of Lynchburg have paid no taxes on their shares of stock in those banks
since 1890.

JUSTICE PECKnAMi,

after making the foregoing state-

ment of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
The complainant objects to the legality of the taxes upon
the ground, among others, that the acts of the Virginia legislature, under which they were levied, violated the provisions
of the constitution of that State, and were, therefore, entirely
invalid. These objections are, as we think, untenable. They
are technical, and relate to alleged defects in the titles of the
acts, in not being sufficiently specific in stating the tax and the
object to which it was to be applied, and also that the taxes
were not equal and uniform. We think the objections are
without merit, and we concur with what is stated upon this
subject in the opinion of the Circuit Court herein. The state
court has held the statutes do not violate any provision of the
state constitution, and we follow that court upon such a question. Merchants' Bank v. Pennsylvania,167 U.S. 461; Schaefer
v. Werling, 188 U. S. 516.

PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. MIARYE.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The chief objections which are made to the taxes are three:
1. No notice is provided for in any of the acts as to when or
where the valuation of the shares of the bank for purposes of
taxation will be made, and hence the shareholder has no op
portunity to be heard upon that question, and the whole tax
is void for that reason.
2. That the acts provide for a valuation of the bank's shares
at the market value without providing for a proportionate
reduction on account of the value of the real estate owned by
the bank, which is also by the law of Virginia to be assessed
for its value against the bank itself; that by reason of this
omission, the shareholder is taxed once on the full market
value of the stock, a part of which consists of the value of the
real estate, and he is taxed again, indirectly, for his proportion
of the amount of the tax paid by the bank on this same real
estate, and the result is that he is taxed upon his bank shares,
as he insists, at a greater rate than upon other moneyed capital, etc.
3. That no provision is made under these acts for permitting
shareholders to deduct their indebtedness from the assessments
upon their shares of stock, while it is alleged the holders of
large amounts of other moneyed capital are by the laws of
Virginia permitted to deduct their indebtedness from that
capital and are called upon to pay taxes only upon the balance.
On these grounds the complainant insists that the taxes were
illegal and void, and upon such grounds it has based its prayer
that the stockholders should be wholly freed from any liability
to pay such taxes or any part thereof.
The defendant under his demurrer argues that, properly construed, although notice is not in terms provided for, yet the
acts do provide an opportunity for a hearing before the tax
can be enforced, and also that there is no illegal discrimination
in the scheme enacted by the legislature of Virginia against
the holders of national bank shares and in favor of other
moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the
State. He denies that, so far as relates to the alleged failure

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

to deduct the value of the real estate of the bank from the
market price of the stock or the indebtedness of the shareholder from the amount upon which such shareholder is assessed, (when the provisions of the general law of Virginia upon
the subject of taxation or other property are compared,) there
was any violation of law or any illegality in theseveral taxes
assessed on such shares. He also insists that the complainant
could not legally represent the shareholders herein or maintain
this action. He further urges that, as neither the original nor
the supplemental bill showed any payment or tender of an
amount which would be justly due, even under the objections
of complainant, the suit could not be maintained.
The Circuit Court held that, as to the taxes for 1891-1895,
under the two acts already mentioned, (acts of 1890 and 1896,)
the suit could not be maintained for the reason that the bank
was under no obligation to pay the taxes for its shareholders,
and there was no penalty or other inconvenience to the bank
attending its refusal to pay, but that the case was different
under the second act of 1896, as to the assessments made after
1895, and that as to those the bank was placed in such a position under that act as permitted it to maintain the suit. The
court then examined the act with reference to the averments
of the bill and supplemental bill, and with regard to the general
laws of Virginia relating to the taxation of other property, and
concluded that the act of 1896 was valid as construed by it,
and that the assessments of 1896 and 1897, under it, were
legal, and therefore dismissed the bill.
In the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to decide
any other question than that which arises from the omission
in either bill to aver payment, or at least a tender of the amount
of taxes equitably and justly due as a condition of obtaining
the interference of a court of equity by enjoining the collection
of the balance.
The prayer of the bill is "that the said defendant and all
others may be perpetually enjoined from collecting taxes assessed on the stockholders by the State of Virginia for the

PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. MARYE.

Opinion of the Court.

years 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896 and 1897; that the.
said acts of the legislature of Virginia assessing the stockholders of your complainant with taxes may be declared unconstitutional and void, and that its stockholders, as well as
your complainant, may be discharged and relieved from all
liability growing out of the assessments."
From this it appears there has, in fact, never been any payment or tender of any part of the taxes assessed against the
shareholders during the years above mentioned, and the omission of an averment of payment or tender of payment was
therefore not a mere oversight.
In our view of the facts set forth in this case in the original
and supplemental bills, the complainant was not entitled to
any injunction unless it paid the amount equitably due, and
if it made such payment then the injunction would issue, restraining the collection of the balance. This is of course upon
the assumption that the objections taken to the acts as above
set forth are well founded. Whether they are or not, it is not
necessary for this purpose to decide.
Taxation of shares of stocks in national banks is the universal
rule, and probably there is no State in the Union in which such
taxation is not provided for as a part of the property subject
to taxation for the general support of the state government.
The State of Virginia has by this legislation sought to provide
for and enforce taxation of this kind of property. It is clearly
shown that it intended to provide for a legal assessment; one
that complied with the conditions of the Federal statute, for
the language of the various acts above mentioned in providing
for such taxation is substantially the same as that used in the
Federal statute, as they provide that the assessments shall not
be on the capital of any bank, but shall be upon the shares at
the same rate as is assessed upon other moneyed capital in
the hands of individuals residing in the State. This is the
purpose of the laws and if in attempting to effect that purpose
some slip is made or some details are provided for therein which
may render assessments under them irregular or even illegal,

OCTOBER TERMI,

Opinion of the Couit.

191 U. S.

that fact does not detract from the equitable duty of the shareholders in national banks to fulfill the plain demands of the
laws, and pay a tax on their shares in like proportion as is assessed upon other moneyed capital, before they can establish
any claim for interference in their behalf by a court of equity.
To the extent (if any) that the assessment exceeds that amount,
it may be assumed proper to ask a court of equity to enjoin its
collection, but surely it offers no equitable foundation for an
injunction restraining the collection of the whole tax, ninetenths of which may be justly due on every equitable principle.
The original and supplemental bills, taken together, show
at least the amount that would be justly and equitably due
on the theory of the complainant, for they show that if the
two deductions (being all that are insisted upon by the complainant) had been made by the taxing officer, the complainant
would not have had any ground of complaint as to the amount
of the taxes. There are data in the original and supplemental
bills from which it can be at once and definitely determined
what the amount of the deductions claimed by complainant
would be. The market value of the stock is stated for each
year, as assessed by the taxing officer, and also the value of
the real estate is stated for each year, and this last amount,
complainant insists, should be deducted in arriving at the
market value of the stock. The bills also show the different
shareholders who had debts at the time the various assessments were made, and the amounts of the deductions they
would, therefore, be entitled to for each of the years in controversy. These two classes of deductions being made, the
complainant offers no equitable objection to taxes which might
be assessed upon the balance. With these data thus appearing,
from which the equitable amount of the taxes due by the shareholders is readily determined, we think this conceded amount
should be paid before a court of equity ought to grant its aid
by way of injunction. The universal rule of a court of equity
is that he who seeks its equitable interposition must himself
do equity. Is there any higher equity than that a citizen

PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. I ARYE.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

should pay the amount of a tax which he concedes to be just
and equitable before asking the aid of a court of equity to grant
an injunction to enjoin the collection of any greater sum?
The complainant, however, insists that the rule does not
exist where the assessments are void and not merely irregular,
and it asserts that these assessments are void because the acts
under which they were laid do not provide for notice to the
shareholder before determining the value of the share upon
which the tax is to be laid, and also because the assessment
violated the act of Congress in being at a greater rate than is
assessed upon other moneyed capital.
We are of opinion, however, that these assessments were
not void within the meaning of the rule which absolves the
taxpayer from the necessity of paying or tendering the amount
equitably due from him. If there were no right to assess the
particular thing at all, either because it is exempt from taxation, or because there is no law providing for the same, an
assessment under such circumstances would be void, and, of
course, no payment or tender of any amount would be necessary before seeking an injunction, because there could be no
amount equitably due where there never had been a right to
assess at all. Where, however, there is a statute which provides for an assessment and gives jurisdiction to the taxing
officer, under some circumstances, to make one, but the particular assessment is invalid for want of a notice to the taxpayer, or some other kindred objection, the equitable duty
still rests upon him to pay what would be his fair proportion
of the tax as compared with that laid upon other property
before he can ask the aid of the chancellor to enjoin the collection of the balance. This is the equitable rule, and it is
good morals as well. To say that the act under which the
tax is levied is unconstitutional, and therefore is the same as
no law, and hence there is no duty to pay anything, because no
tax can be levied without some law therefor, is to state the
proposition too broadly. We concede that if the law were
unconstitutional because, for instance, there was no constitu-

OCTOBER TERU, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

tional power to tax the particular property, there is no necessity to pay anything. But where some part of the law may
be unconstitutional because of a failure to comply with some
matter of detail, but the amount which the owner of the property ought to pay is perfectly clear under the provisions of
law, then if the taxpayer desire to be exempted from paying
more than his share, he must pay or offer to pay his proportion
before equity will aid him in his effort to escape paying a disproportionate share.
The statute herein provides for a tax and creates the equitable obligation to pay some amount by reason of the shares, and
even though there may be some obstacle which preveits its
entire legality, yet the person assessed should recognize his
equitable obligation to pay the tax to the extent stated before
he can base any claim for the assistance of equity to get rid
of the balance of the tax. The mere lack of a provision in the
statute for notice did not take away the jurisdiction of the
taxing officer to make an assessment under any circumstances.
What is the purpose of notice? Clearly that the person
assessed may have an opportunity to show some reason, if
any, why he should not be assessed at all, or else not so much
as he has been in fact. But suppose that, although there was
no notice provided for in the act, the taxpayer had nevertheless heard of the assessment, and in fact had appeared before
the assessing officer and made his case, showing he should not
be assessed more than a certain stated amount, and the officer
had allowed his claim to its full extent. Should he be thereafter permitted to resist by means of an injunction the collection of the tax so imposed upon the ground that the statute
provided for no notice to him, and none was officially given?
Certainly not. So when he comes into a court of equity to ask
its aid, should it appear on his own statement -or otherwise,
that if all the claims he makes were allowed he would still
equitably owe the government a certain sum by reason of the
statute providing for the assessment, and his ownership of the
property assessed, will he be heard to insist that the court

PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. MARYE.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

grant him an injunction preventing the collection of any tax
because he had no notice of the assessment? He owes something to the government, as a tax upon his shares, and ought
any court of equity to aid him in escaping all obligation because, while insisting that the whole assessment is illegal, it
yet clearly appears that a portion thereof, even if uncollectible,
is nevertheless equitably, and justly, due? Is the equitable
obligation arising by reason of these statutes and under these
circumstances, to pay some tax, completely obliterated because
the particular tax cannot legally be collected, and may be
called void? We think clearly not. This same reason applies not only to a lack of notice but also to the case of a claim
that the tax is illegal because it did not allow the deductions
which by the Federal statute should have been allowed. The
tax under such circumstances is not void, but at most voidable
for the illegal amount. Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U. S. 305,
315.
We refer to a few of the many authorities upon the subject.
In State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 616,'it was said by
Mr. Justice Miller, in delivering the opinion of the court, as
follows:
"Before complainants seek the aid of the court to be relieved of the excessive tax, they should pay what is due. Before they ask equitable relief, they should do that justice which
is necessary to enable the court to hear them. . . . It is
not sufficient to say in the bill that they are ready and willing
to pay whatever may be found due. They must first pay what
is conceded to be due, or what can be seen to be due on the face
of the bill, or be shown by affidavits, whether conceded or not,
before the preliminary injunction should be granted. The
State is not to be thus tied up as to that of which there is no
contest, by lumping it with that which is really contested. If
the proper officer refuses to receive a part of the tax, it must
be tendered, and tendered without the condition annexed of a
receipt in full for all the taxes assessed."
This language is used in relation to taxes which were claimed

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

191 U. S.

to be too high with reference to other property in the State,
but the principle of the rule exists even where the tax is averred
to be too great, because certain deductions provided by law
were not made, or because there was no notice given of the
assessment, and hence the taxpayer never had an opportunity
to be heard. If, after hearing, there would appear something
to be equitably due from the taxpayer, he should pay it before
seeking relief from the court.
In Cummings v. National Bank, 101 U. S. 153, where the
question was whether the rule adopted by the local boards of
assessment was in conflict with the state constitution, the court
held that it was, and that an assessment made under those
circumstances was illegal, but that nevertheless the taxpayer
was bound to pay the amount equitably due, and the opinion
closes with the statement that "the complainant having paid
to defendant, or into the Circuit Court for his use, the tax
which was its true share of the public burden, the decree of the
Circuit Court enjoining the collection of the remainder is
affirmed."
In National Bank v. Kimball, 103 U. S. 732, the general rule
was held to be that the owner of taxable property seeking to
enjoin the collection of a tax thereon, which he alleges to be
in excess of what is lawful, must first pay or tender so much
thereof as is justly due. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the
court, said:
"The bill attempts to evade this rule by alleging that the
tax is wholly void, and, therefore, none of it ought to be paid,
and that by reason of the absence of all uniformity of values,
it is impossible for any person to compute or ascertain what
the stockholders of complainant bank ought to pay on the
shares of the bank."
The State Railroad Cases, supra, were then referred to by the
court and quotations therefrom made, and the principles
therein announced were held to be sufficient to decide the
case at bar, thus holding that the mere fact that a tax was
void for some particular reason was not ground for the inter-

PEOPLE'S NATIONAL BANK v. MARYE.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

position of a court of equity by injunction, where it could
be seen there was an equitable obligation due from the
taxpayer to pay a certain conceded amount, or an amount
which could easily be ascertained, and which had not been
paid.
These cases in this court are sufficient to show the propriety
of the rule, and that it has been followed by us whenever the
opportunity arose.
The same principle has been, however, decided by many of
the state courts. In Smith v. Humphrey, Auditor General, &c.,
20 Michigan, 398, 409, Mr. Justice Cooley, delivering the opinion of the court, said:
"He who comes into equity for relief must be willing to do
equity; and there can be no ground upon which, in enjoining
an excessive claim, the complainant can be discharged from
that which is justly due. (Citing Story and Spence.) This
is the rule even as between individuals; and there is at least
equal reason for applying it in behalf of the State when it is
seeking to collect its revenues. We have had occasion to
apply it heretofore in suits to enjoin taxes. Conway v. Waverly, 15 Michigan, 257; Palmer v. Napoleon, 16 Michigan, 176.
See also Hersey v. Supervisors of Milwaukee, 16 Wisconsin, 185;
Bond v. Kenosha, 17 Wisconsin, 288."
This Michigan case was one on appeal from an absolute
decree perpetually enjoining a sale for unpaid taxes because
of a demand of interest by the proper authorities at a rate not
allowed by law. The court held that it could not be sustained,
and that the payment of the amount due, with interest at the
lawful rate, must be made, and then the sale would be perpetually enjoined.
In Merrill v. Humphrey, Auditor General, &c., 24 Michigan,
170, it was held that a property owner seeking to enjoin the
collection of a tax on the ground that the amount is excessive
should show by his bill, as near as may be practicable, what
amount is just and what is excessive, and he should pay to the
proper officer the amount which he concedes to be properly

chargeable against himself. Mr. Justice Cooley, delivering the
opinion of the court in that case, said (p. 175):
"We have already said that the complainant should be required to do equity as a condition of relief. What is just to
the public cannot be done unless he pays within due time such
proportion of the tax assessed upon him as he concedes to be
fair; and we think this payment should be required by the injunction master to be made to the proper officer as a condition
to the allowance of injunction. To this extent, the case is
within the principle of Conway v. Waverly, 15 Michigan, 257,
and Palmer v. Napoleon, 16 Michigan, 176, heretofore decided
us, and of several Wisconsin cases," etc.
by
. In Steuart v. Meyer, 54 Maryland, 454, where it appeared
that the sale of certain property in the city of Baltimore for
the non-payment of taxes was illegal in not complying with
the statute, it was held (p. 468) that the complainant, as a
condition of obtaining a decree setting aside the sale, must pay
to the party entitled to receive it the full amount of the taxes
in arrear at the time of the sale by the collector, together with
the interest accrued thereon to the time of the payment, and
also all taxes that had subsequently accrued and were due on
the property with interest.
In Alexander v. Merrck, 121 Illinois, 606, it was held that
'inaccordance with the principle that a party seeking equity
must do equity, a court of equity in setting aside a void tax
sale as a cloud upon title, would still require the complainant
to refund the taxes paid by the holders of the certificates of
purchase on their purchase and also succeeding taxes to protect their purchase. In this case it was conceded that the tax
sales were illegal and void, and that any deeds issued by the
county clerk, based upon such sales, would also be unlawful
and void, but nevertheless would, on their face, appear to be
valid official acts of the clerk, and would cause a cloud upon
the title to the lands. At page 614 the court said:
"The complainant claims that the certificates of sale were
clouds upon his title and obstacles in the way of its beneficial

enjoyment. He asks a court of equity to dissipate these
clouds and remove these obstacles. He, who seeks equity,
must do equity. The court below by its decree should have
required the complainant to refund the taxes paid by Reed
and Forsythe as a condition to granting the relief prayed for.
That such a requirement is proper in cases of this kind has been
repeatedly held by this court."
In Morrison v. Hershire, Treasurer, &c., 32 Iowa, 271, 277,
an assessment for local improvements, the court refused to
interfere even if the assessments were, as to one of the fronts
on the street, unauthorized unless the party complainant paid
or tendered the portion legally due. The court said:
"An elementary principle of eluity is applicable to the objections here presented. It is not denied that under the rule
of assessment as fixed by the council, if applied as contended
for by plaintiffs, certain sums are due from the lot owners which
are charges upon their lots. These sums the respective plaintiffs are bound by law and in equity to pay. Before plaintiffs
can claim relief as to the sums which they insist are overassessed upon their property, they must pay or offer to pay
the sums lawfully and justly due, according to their own theory
of the assessment; for he who seeks equity must do equity; but
this plaintiffs have not done."
And on page 278:
"We understand that it is a settled rule in equity that where
a party is in conscience bound to pay a certain sum of money
which, together with an amount that he is not legally bound
to pay, is brought as a legal claim against him, equity will not
restrain the collection of the whole, unless he pay or offer to
pay, by tender, the sum which he justly and legally owes."
The rule requiring payment of the sum equitably due cannot be too rigorously enforced in cases regarding payment of
taxes. This rule does not assume the validity of the assessment for that sum, but it simply says that under the circumstances the taxpayer shall have no right to come into court
and enjoin the payment of any tax when the amount which,

equitably, he ought to pay is easily and certainly determinable
from the conceded facts in the case.
In the case at bar because certain deductions were not made,
although there was a large sum assessable even if the deductions were allowed, the injunction granted has prevented the
collection of any part of the assessments, and for twelve years
the stockholders in these Lynchburg banks have paid not one
dollar of taxes by reason of their ownership of such shares.
This is inequitable and unjust, and a court of equity should
not be made the instrument by which such injustice is continued.
Although we reach the conclusion above stated on the ground
we have discussed, it is not to be inferred that we regard the
other grounds untenable. We intimate no opinion in regard
to them. To the end that complainant may, if it so elect, pay
as provided in this opinion, and then commence further proceedings, the dismissal of the bill will be without prejudice,
and as thus modified the decree of the Circuit Court is

Affirmed.
