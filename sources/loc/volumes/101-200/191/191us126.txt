HOWARD v. FLEMING.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.

HOWARD v. NORTH CAROLINA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREAM COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.
Nos. 44,45. Argued October 27,1903.-Decided November 16, 903.
The decision of the highest court of a State that conspiracy to defraud is
a common law offense and as such cognizable in the courts of that State,
although there be no statute defining or punishing such a crime, is not
a Federal question, nor reviewable by this court. Nor can this court
inquire whether the indictment sufficiently charged the offense.
Undue leniency in one case does not transform a reasonable punishment
in another case to a cruel one and where the highest court of a State has
sustained the sentences of ten years each, imposed on two men convicted
with a third of a conspiracy to defraud, and such punishment does not
from the record appear unreasonable considering the nature of the
offense, this court will not set aside the judgment as imposing a cruel and
unusual punishment either on the facts or because the other person convicted was only sentenced to seven years.
This court will not hold that the omission of the recital of reasons which
justify the peculiar form of a sentence will invalidate a judgment which
is warranted by the statute and which has been sustained by the highest court of the State.
When the highest court of the State has decided that in a criminal trial it
is sufficient to charge the jury correctly in reference to reasonable doubt
and that an omission to refer to any presumption of innocence does not
invalidate the proceedings, such an omission cannot be regarded by this
court as a denial of due process of law.
Where no claim to protection under the Federal constitution was presented
to the Supreme Court of the State, a writ of error will not lie from this
court even though Federal questions were discussed in the opinions of
the state court.

the June term, 1901, of the Superior Court of Guilford
County, North Carolina, the three parties named as appellants in the first of these cases and as plaintiffs in error in the
second were indicted, tried and convicted of the crime of conAT

spiracy. Daly was sentenced to the penitentiary for seven
years and Howard and Hawley for ten years each. All appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, by which court the
judgment was affirmed, 129 North Carolina, 584, and thereupon the writ of error in the last case was issued. A writ of
habeas corpus was also sued out from the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of North Carolina,
directed to the warden of the state prison, which, after hearing, was dismissed, and from such dismissal an appeal was
taken to this court; and that is the first of the above cases.
Mr. Frank P. Blair, with whom Mr. Leslie A. Gilmore was
on the brief, for appellants in No. 44, and plaintiffs in error
in No. 45:
Habeas corpus proceedings and writ of error may proceed
concurrently. Ex parte Frederich, 149 U. S. 70; Whitten v.
Tomlinson, 160 U. S. 242; Markuson v. Boucher, 175 U. S. 186;
Kohl v. Lehiback, 160 U. S. 293.
With respect to the inhibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment, it makes no difference by what branch or instrumentality
of the state government they are violated, the Federal courts
will protect the citizen of the United States in any event.
Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226; Scott v. McNeal, 154 U. S. 34. The judgment being in violation of the
Constitution is utterly void.
The defendants below were denied the equal protection of
the laws. The sentence is more severe than any ever infficted in the State for like offense. For shorter sentences in
worse cases see State v. Powell, 121 N. Car. 635; Sate v. Wilson, 121 N. Car. 650; State v. Jackson, 82 N. Car. 565; State v.
Mallett, 125 N. Car. 718; S. C., 181 U. S. 589; Rev. Code,
N. Car. ff 974, 1107; Laws, 1870, ch. 103, § 2.
The judgment should have contained a recital in order to
make it valid to sentence to the penitentiary instead of to the
roads. By reason of the unequal sentence, Daly being only
sentenced to seven years, the appellants were denied equal

protection of the laws. There were no different degrees of
culpability. State v. Jackson, 82 N. Car. 565. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a different or higher punishment to be imposed on one than i imposed on all for like
offenses. Re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436; Caldwell v. Texas, 137
U. S. 692; Connolly v. Union & C. Co., 184 U. S. 540.
The sentence is "cruel and unusual," within the meaning
of the state constitution; and hence discriminates against defendants below. State v. Driver, 78 N. Car. 423. The trial,
conviction and sentence were not due process of law. The
offense was not a crime by statute of North Carolina. There
is no offense of conspiracy under the common law, and there
being nolawcoveringthis offense, defendants were tried by a
mob and not by due process of law.
There was no offense-conspiracy to defraud-at common
law prior to 1607, the year at which most of our states put
the statutory limit of their adoption of the common law.
Subsequent to that date English precedents are persuasive
merely. Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264; Comm. v. York, 9
Mete. 93; Sen. Spencer in Lambert v. People, 9 Cow. 578, 590;
Bowie v. Duval, 1 Gill. & J. 175; Stump v. Napier, 2 Yerg. 45.
As to the common law of North Carolina in regard to conspiracies to defraud, the lower court relied on State v. Buchanan, 5 Har. & J. 317, which is an incorrect decision, as is
also Comm. v. Judd, 2 Massachusetts, 329. See State v. Rickey,
4 Halst. 293. And see the cases cited in the opinion of the
court below. As to rulings of North Carolina courts in regard to common law crimes, see State v. Kessler, 78 N. Car. 469.
If there was any such thing as common law conspiracy in
North Carolina it hadbeen abolished by statute. Rev. Code,
§ 641. State v. Younger, 12 N. Car. 357. A construction in
favor of liberty should be adopted if possible. United States
v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76.
In North Carolina the court has always held that a cheat
must be by false token, weights or measures, in order to be
eriminal. State v, Justice, 13 N. Car. 199. Civil injuries

should not be the subjects of criminal prosecutions. Good
policy does not require the multiplication of public offenses.
State v. Politto, 11 N. Car. 348; State v. Alfred, 84 N. Car. 349;
State v. Phifer, 65 N. Car. 321; State v. Burke, 108 N. Car. 750;
United States v. Watkins, 3 Cranch C. C. 441.
The sentence was not due process of law, because greater
than can be inflicted for the offense in any other American
judiciary, and also because it was so severe that it raises the
presumption that vindictiveness, passion and hatred entered
into the judgment. [Numerous state penal laws as to conspiracy and term of punishment are cited in detail, many of
them less than ten years.]
The sentence is not due process because the people are
opposed to judge-made crimes and only tolerate them when
followed by mildest punishment.
In United States courts, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
New York, Michigan, Maine, Vermont, Iowa, Kentucky and
Pennsylvania it is not a crime to combine to defraud by false
pretenses, unless the pretenses consist of false weights, measures or tokens or some other means criminal in themselves.
State v. Parker, 43 N. H. 83; Comm. v. Eastman, 1 Cush. 189;
Comm. v. Wallace, 16 Gray, 221; Lambert v. People, 9 Cow.
578; Alderman v. People, 4 Michigan, 414; People v. Barkelow,

v. Ward,92 Kentucky, 158 ; State v. Keach, 40 Vermont, 113;
United States v. Walsh, 5 Dill. 58.
On the other hand the States of Illinois, Maryland, New
Jersey and others hold that combination to cheat and defraud
by whatever means is criminal. Cole v. People, 84 Illinois, 216;
State v. Buchanan, 5 Har. & J. 317; State v. Cole, 10 Vroom, 324.
In several of the States conspiracy is defined and the statutes expressly declare that no other combinations shall be
deemed criminal. Conspiracies defined, and no combinations
other than such are punishable. Arizona, Penal Code, § 3;

No crimes except statutory. Common law crimes not punishable. Arizona, Penal Code, § 3; California, Penal Code

Ohio, no common law offenses, Mitchell v. State, 42 Ohio St.

New crimes should not be createdby the court. Wiltberger's
Case, 5 Wheat. 76, 96; United States v. Sheldon, 2 Wheat. 119;
United States v. Morris, 14 Peters, 464, 475; The Federalist,
No. 62.
The trial was not due process because the judge refused to
charge on the presumption of innocence. State v. Heaton, 77
N. Car. 505; Coffin v. United States, 156 U. S. 432; Cochrane v.
United States, 157 U. S. 286; Kirby v. United States, 174 U. S.
47, 55; Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492; Agnew v. United
States, 165 U. S. 36. The presumption of innocence is vital
and fundamental. Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172; In re
Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436; Hurtado v. State, 110 U. S. 516. A
denial of such a right by any instrumentality of a State is a
denial of due process of law.
The indictment charges no offense and therefore is not due
process of law. An indictment charging a conspiracy to cheat
and defraud, without more, is fatally defective; or else so defective that a bill of particulars is matter of right and it is
fatal error to refuse it. King v. Gill, 2 B. & Aid. 204; Rex

Mr. Robert D. Gilmer, Attorney General of the State of North

An objection to the jury in North Carolina must be taken

An almost sirilar rule exists in the United States courts.
United States v. Gale, 109 U. S. 63; Agnew v. United States, 164
U. S. 36. The plaintiffs in error were not denied equal protection of the laws in accepting and filing the indictment.
Finding of facts by the state courts cannot be reviewed
either upon appeal or writ of error. Dower v. Richards, 151
U. S. 663, 668, 669; In re Buchanan, 158 U. S. 31; Bartlett v.
Lockwood, 160 U. S. 360; Stanley v. Schwalby, 162 U. S. 278;
Noble v. Mitchell, 164 U. S. 373; Israelv. Arthur, 152 U. S. 362.
It is for the state court to determine whether or not its statutes are binding under the state constitution, and whether
one has received equal piotection of the laws of the State in a
regular administration of the criminal law. Leeper v. Texas,
139 U. S. 462; O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U. S. 336.
The insufficiency of an indictment is not a Federal question.
An erroneous ruling on a defective indictment does not present a Federal question. Bergemann v. Backer, 157 U. S. 655;
Central Land Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 112; Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U. S. 59; In re Boardmen, 169 U. S. 44; Remington

where information is provided for. McNulty v. California,
149 U. S. 645; Talton v. Mayes, 163 U. S. 384; Nordstron v.
Washington, 164 U. S. 705. The question as to whether or

not an indictment charges a crime under the laws of a State
does not present a Federal question. CaIdwell v. Texas, 137
U. S. 692; Davis v. Texas, 139 U. S. 652; Bergemann v. Backer,
157 U. S. 656; O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U. S. 323.
The appellants were not denied equal protection of the laws
of North Carolina, in that the nisi prius judge did not instruct
the jury that they were presumed to be innocent, and that
this presumption attended them until it was overcome by
positive evidence of guilt.
The punishment was not cruel under the Federal constitution as there is no evidence to support the statement that it
is more severe than any ever before imposed. No Federal
question is presented. Walker v. Vellaraso, 6 Wall. 128;
Dower v. Richards, 151 U. S. 663; State v. Mallett, 125 N. Car.
718.
This is simply a case of a state court determining the meaning of a state statute and constitution, and where there is
nothing obviously violative of the fundamental principles.
Lambert v. Barrett, 157 U. S. 697; Raezel v. Kirk, 172 U. S. 646;
Kohl v. Lehlback, 160 U. S. 296, and other cases cited, supra.
The judgment is not void because the punishment is cruel
and unusual as defined by the constitution of North Carolina.
That is not a Federal question, and as to the contention that
the punishment is violative of the Eighth Amendment of the
Federal constitution, that Amendment is inapplicable to the
States, and applies only to Federal action. O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U. S. 323; Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243; Peryear
v. Massachusetts, 5 Wall. 475; Ex parts Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436;
Davis v. Texas, 139 U. S. 651.
Whether there is a common law crime of conspiracy to defraud cognizable by the courts of North Carolina, is not a
Federal question, and the decision of state courts as to
what are the laws of the State is binding upon the courts
of the United States. South Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S.

& G. R. Co. v. Georgia, 98 U. S. 359, 366; Baldwin v.
Kansas, 129 U. S. 52, 57. The powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited by
the Fourteenth Amendment except that no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and
impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular
course of administration through courts of justice is due
process, and when secured by the law of the State the
constitutional requirement is satisfied. A similar indictment
was sustained in State v. Brady, 107 N. Car. 822; State v.
Younger, 12 N. C. R. 357. As to cases on common law conspiracy see Caldwell v. T&as, 137 U. S. 691; State v. Buchanan,

Bishop's New Criminal Law, § 774, vol. II; State v. Brady, 107
N. C. R. 822; State v. Powell, 121 N. C. R. 635. According
to the common law, a conspiracy upon the part of two or more
persons, with the intent, by their combined power, to wrong
others or to prejudice the rights of the public, is in itself illegal,
though nothing be actually done in execution of such conspiracy. Arthur v. Oakes, 63 Fed. Rep. 321. Statutes against
conspiracies are merely declaratory of the common law. Farmers Loan and Trust Co. v. Northern Pacific Railroad Co., 60

that when state questions have been disposed of by the appropriate state authorities, it is not the province of this court
to interfere, and there is no basis for the suggestion of any
violation of the Constitution of the United States; the denial

As to the appeal from the habeas corpus proceeding after a

not be inquired into in habeas corpus proceedings, except in
cases of peculiar urgency. The proper and usual remedy is by
writ of error. Whitten v. Tomlinson, 160 U. S. 238. Except
in peculiar and urgent cases, the courts of the United States
will not discharge the prisoner by habeas corpus in advance of
a final determinationof his case in the courts of the State; and,
even after such final determination in those courts, will generally leave the petitioner to the usual and orderly course of
proceeding by writ of error from this court. - Ex parte Royall,

MR. JUSTiCE BREwER, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
Although these are separate cases, coming from different
courts, we shall consider them together, for the same proceedings are challenged in each.

HOWARD v. FLEMING.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

We premise that the trial was had in a state court, and therefore our range of inquiry is not so broad as it would be if it had
been in one of the courts of the United States. The highest
court of the State has affirmed the validity of the proceedings
in that trial, and we may not interfere with its judgment unless some right guaranteed by the Federal constitution was
denied and the proper steps taken to preserve for our consideration the question of that denial.
The first contention demanding notice is that the indictment charged no crime. As found it contained three counts,
but the two latter were abandoned, and therefore the inquiry
is limited to the sufficiency of the first. That charged a conspiracy to defraud. There is in North Carolina no statute
defining or punishing such a crime, but the Supreme Court
held that it was a common law offense, and as such cognizable
in the courts of the State. In other words, the Supreme Court
decided that a conspiracy to defraud was a crime punishable
under the laws of the State, and that the indictment sufficiently charged the offense. Whether there be such an offense is not a Federal question, and the decision of the Supreme
Court is conclusive upon the matter. Neither are we at liberty
to inquire whether the indictment sufficiently charged the offense. Caldwell v. Texas, 137 U. S. 692, 698; Davis v. Texas,
139 U. S. 651, 653; Bergemann v. Backer, 157 U. S. 655.
Again, it is contended that the defendants were denied the
equal protection of the laws, in that the sentence was more
severe than ever before inflicted in North Carolina for a like
offense, and was cruel and unusual; in that two were given
ten years' and the third only seven years' imprisonment, and
also in that they were sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary instead of to hard labor on the public roads. No
case of a similar offense is cited from the judicial reports of
North Carolina, and the Supreme Court in its opinion refers
to the crime as "a fashion of swindling, which has doubtless
been little practiced in this State." That for other offenses,
which may be considered by most, if not all, of a more grievous

OCTOBER TERJ, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

character, less punishments have been inflicted does not make
this sentence cruel. Undue leniency in one case does not transform a reasonable punishment in another case to a cruel one.
Swindling by means of a pretended gold brick is no trifling
crime, and a conspiracy to defraud by such means does not
commend itself to sympathy or leniency. But it is unnecessary to attempt to lay down any rule for determining exactly
what is necessary to render a punishment cruel and unusual
or under what circumstances this court will interfere with the
decision of a state court in respect thereto. It is enough to
refer to In re Kemmter, 136 U. S. 436, in which these questions
were discussed, and to say that a sentence of ten years for an
offense of the nature disclosed by the testimony, especially
after it has been sustained by the Supreme Court of a State,
does not seem to us deserving to be called cruel. If the effect
of this sentence is to induce like criminals to avoid its territory, North Carolina is to be congratulated, not condemned.
Doubtless there were sufficient reasons for giving to one of the
conspirators a less term than the others. At any rate, there
is no such inequality as will justify us in setting aside the
judgment against the two.
So far as respects the sentence of the defendants to the
penitentiary instead of to work on the public roads, section 4,
chap. 355, pp. 630, 631. Laws, N. C., March 7, 1887, in terms
warrants it, for that provides that when the judge presiding
is satisfied that there is good reason to fear an attempt to release or injure any person convicted of any of the offenses,
for which sentences to work on the public roads may be imposed, it shall be lawful for him to sentence to imprisonment
in the penitentiary. It is true there is no recital of any such
reason to fear, but we cannot hold in the face of the decision
of the Supreme Court of the State that the omission of such
recital invalidates the judgment.
Again, it is said that there was not due process, because the
trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the presumption of
innocence. He did charge that the guilt of the accused must

HOWARD w. FLE=I iG.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

be shown beyond a reasonable doubt, and that on a failure in
this respect it was the duty to acquit. He also explained
what is meant by the term "reasonable doubt." The Supreme
Court sustained the charge. Of course, that is a decision of
the highest court of the State that in a criminal trial it is sufficient to charge correctly in reference to a reasonable doubt
and that an omission to refer to any presumption of innocence
does not invalidate the proceedings. In the face of this ruling
as to the law of the State, the omission in a state trial of any
reference to the presumption of innocence cannot be regarded
as a denial of due process of law.
These are the principal matters presented by counsel. Some
of them were argued elaborately both in brief and orally;
especially that in reference to the absence of any statute providing for the punishment of conspiracy, anid the alleged absence of any common law offense of that nature. We have
not deemed it necessary to review the various authorities, or
enter upon any discussion of the matter, because we are of
opinion that the decision of the Supreme Court of the State
in reference thereto is conclusive upon us.
It does not appear that the Federal character of the questions was presented to the Supreme Court of the State, although in the opinions of the Supreme Court the questions
themselves were fully discussed. But in the absence of any
claim to protection under the Federal Constitution, we are
compelled to hold that we have no jurisdiction in the case
coming from the Supreme Court of the State, and the writ of
error will be
Dismissed.
The same questions were presented in the habeas corpus
case, and as that comes to us from a Federal Court we have
jurisdiction, and in that case the judgment will be
Affirmed.
