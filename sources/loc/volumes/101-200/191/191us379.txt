WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN RAILWAY CO. v. POWERS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
No. 77. Submitted November 13,1903.-Decided November 30,1903.

A provision in a general tax law that railroads thereafter building and op
erating a road north of a certain parallel shall be exempted from the tax,
for ten years, unless the gross earnings shall exceed a certain sum, is not
addressed as a covenant to such railroads and does not constitute a contract with them, the obligations of which cannot be impaired consistently
with the Constitution of the United States.

THE facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Jesse B. Barton for appellant:
Under the constitution of the State of Michigan the Legis4
lature has at all times had the power to exempt from taxation.
This was expressly held by the Supreme Court of the State of
Michigan in Board of Supervisors of Chippewa v. Auditor General, 65 Michigan, 408. The law which is attacked in this case
was before the Supreme Court of the State of lMrchigan in the
case of Manistee & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Comrs. of R. R., 118 Michigan, 349, in which it was attacked solely on the ground that it
was a violation of the Constitutions of the United States and of
the State of Michigan, prohibiting the passage of laws impairing the obligations of contracts; and while that court in
that case held that the exemption was only a bounty and that
it was, therefore, subject to repeal, it held that the exemption
was good and that the right to it was vested until repealed and
that the company was exempted from taxation until the act
went into effect.

rations owning or operating any railroad in this State," as
amended by the act of 1897, is in violation of the Constitution
and laws of the United States relating to commerce.
The act of 1897, if it repeals the act of 1893 so as to take
away the right of exemption provided in the act of 1893, is in
violation of the Federal and state constitutions prohibiting the
impairment of the obligation of contracts. Binghamton Bridge

. Argument for Appellee.

In considering whether a State has contracted away its sovereign powers, nothing is to be taken against the State by
intendment.
The right of taxation is a sovereign right, inherent in every
sovereignty whose existence and exercise are essential to the
existence and continuance of government, and although in
certain instances it may be granted away, every presumption
is against the grant, which is not to be extended beyond what
is actually expressed. The exemption must be clearly made
out, and doubt is fatal to the claim. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Peters, 561; Gilman v. Sheboygan, 67 U. S. 510; Ohio

The grant of exemption was a mere gratuity-a bountyand had not the elements of, and cannot be construed as, a
contract. The essential element of a binding contract, viz., a
consideration, is wanting. East Saginaw Mfg. Co. v. City of

The construction by the Supreme Court of Michigan of the
authority of the legislature under the reserved right to alter,
amend or repeal corporate charters, contained in the state
constitution, is final and conclusive, and will be followed by
the Federal courts. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 40; Bucher v.
Cheshire R. Co., 125 U. S. 555; Pittsburg,etc., R. Co. v. Backus,
154 U. S. 421; McElvaine v. Brush, 142 U. S. 155; Miller's
Ezrs. v. Swann, 150 U. S. 132.
There are numerous Federal cases upholding the right of a
State to alter or amend a corporate charter where the right so
to do is reserved in the Constitution, a prior general law, or
the act of incorporation.
The insertion of a clause reserving the right to alter, amend
or repeal, indicates that such practice grew from a suggestion
contained in the opinion of Mr. Justice Story in the Dartmouth
College case, 4 Wheat. 712, to the effect that corporations and
corporate charters might by such reservation be kept under
control. Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454, is a case on all
fours with this.
Where such right is reserved, the charter and all rights and
privileges held thereunder are subject to legislative control,
and may be repealed or taken away at the will of that body
and the sole limitation upon the authority of the legislature,
is that vested rights which can be held independently of the
charter or the charter contract, cannot be interfered with.
An exemption from taxation is not a vested right, and may
be taken away or altered where the right to alter, amend or
repeal is reserved. Spring Valley Waterworks v. Schbttler, 110

It is questionable as to whether the Michigan legislature has
authority to create an inviolable contract to exempt corporations from taxation. Walcott v. People, 17 Michigan, 68.
Section 3 of article III of the general railroad law does not
violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.
If the tax is not on the interstate receipts, the mode of determining the amount of such tax is immaterial, and the validity of the law fixing them is a matter of legislative policy
and discretion, and is not open to criticism by the courts.

Opinion of the Court.
MR.

191 U. S.

JvsTIcE Hom s delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a decree of the United States Circuit
Court dismissing the plaintiff's bill on demurrer. The bill
seeks to enjoin the auditor general of the State of Michigan
from collecting a tax, on the ground that the law imposing the
tax is contrary to the Constitution of the United States as
impairing the obligation of contracts and interfering with interstate commerce.
The alleged contract is contained in a law of May 27, 1893,
§ 3, which, after levying a specific tax on railroads, provided
"that the rate of taxation fixed by this act or any other law of
this State shall not apply to any railway or railroad company
hereafter building and operating a line of railroad within this
State noth of parallel forty-four of latitude until the same has
been operated for the full period of ten years, unless the gross
earnings shall equal four thousand dollars per mile, except,"
etc. Afterwards, on October 23, 1893, the Menominee and
Northern Railroad Company was incorporated under the laws
of the State, and forthwith conveyed all its property, rights
and franchises to the plaintiff, a Wisconsin corporation, which
is assumed to stand in the shoes of the Michigan company.
The plaintiff thereupon constructed the road. This road is
north of parallel forty-four, its gross earnings never have been
equal to four thousand dollars per mile, and it would be entitled to the exemptions just stated if the law of 1893 still were
in force. But on June 4, 1897, the State passed a law amending the act of 1893, and levying a "specific tax upon the property and business of [every] railroad corporation operated
within the State," and enacted that "when the railroad lies
partly within and partly without this State, prima facie, the
gross income of said company from such road for the purposes
of taxation shall be on the actual earnings of the road in Michigan, computed by adding to the income derived from the
business transacted by said company entirely within this State,
such proportion of the income of said company arising from the

Opinion of the Court.

interstate business as the length of the road over which said
interstate business is carried in this State bears to the entire
length of the road over which said interstate business is carried." This is the law which the plaintiff says is unconstitutional for the reasons above set forth.
The demurrer to the bill was sustained on the ground that
the act of 1893 made no valid contract of exemption from
taxation, and that the act of 1897, repealing the exemption
granted in 1893, was a constitutional law.
The plaintiff makes a supplemental alternative argument
that the later statute should not be construed to repeal the
act of 1893 with regard to roads in the plaintiff's position. If
that were so the plaintiff would have no standing in this court.
But the repeal is plain from the express words at the end of
the section quoted from the act of 1897, repealing all acts or
parts of acts contravening the provisions of that section, from
the fact that it is an amendment of the section quoted from
the act of 1893, and from the case of Manistee & Northeastern
Railroad Co. v. Commissioner of Railroads, 118 Michigan, 349,
350. See also Welch v. Cook, 97 U. S. 541. On that question
we follow the state court. Northern Central Railway Co. v.
Maryland,187 U. S. 258, 267.
The first and main question, then, is whether the act of 1893
purported to make an irrevocable contract with such railroad
as might thereafter comply with its terms. The question is
pretty well answered by a series of decisions in this court. A
distinction between an exemption from taxation contained in
a special charter and general encouragement to all persons to
engage in a certain class of enterprise, is pointed out in East
Saginaw Manfg. Co. v. East Saginaw, 13 Wall. 373, ("Salt
Co. v. East Saginaw"); S. C., 19 Michigan, 259. In earlier
and later cases it was mentioned that there was no counterobligation, service, or detriment incurred, that properly could be
regarded as a consideration for the supposed contract. Rector,

191 U. S.

v. New Orleans, 166 U. S. 143. See Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15
Wall. 454, 459. But whatever the ground, thus far attempts
like the present to make a contract out of the clauses in a
scheme of taxation which happen to benefit certain parties
have failed. See further, Welch v. Cook, 97 U. S. 541, and
Manistee & Northeastern Railroad Co. v. Commissionerof Railroads, 118 Michigan, 349, in which the state court deals with
this very act.
It may be that a State, by sufficient words, might bind itself
without consideration, as a private individual may bind himself by recognizance or by affixing a seal. A State might
abolish the requirement of consideration altogether for simple
contracts by private persons, and, it may be that it equally
might dispense with the requirement for itself. But the
presence or absence of consideration is an aid to construction
in doubtful cases-a circumstance to take into account in
determining whether the State has purported to bind itself
irrevocably or merely has used words of prophecy, encouragement or bounty, holding out a hope but not amounting to a
covenant.
In the case at bar, of course the building and operating of the
railroad was a sufficient detriment or change of position to
constitute a consideration if the other elements were present.
But the other elements are that the promise and the detriment
are the conventional inducements each for the other. No
matter what the actual motive may have been, by the express
or implied terms of the supposed contract, the promise and
the consideration must purport to be the motive each for the
other, in whole or at least in part. It is not enough that the
promise induces the detriment or that the detriment induces
the promise if the other half is wanting. If we are to deal
with this proviso in a general tax law as we should deal with
an alleged simple contract, while no doubt in some cases between private persons the above distinctions have not been
kept very sharply in mind, Martinv. Meles, 179 Massachusetts,
114, 117, it is clear that we should require an adequate ex-

Opinion of the Court.

pression of an actual intent on the part of the State to set
change of position against promise before we hold that it has
parted with a great attribute of sovereignty beyond the right
of change. See Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railroad v.
Dennis, 116 U. S.665, 668. Looking at the case in this way,
then, we find no such adequate expression. No- doubt the
State expected to encourage railroad building, and the railroad
builders expected the encouragement, but the two things are
not set against each other in terms of bargain. See Covington
v. Kentucky, 173 U. S.231, 238, 239.
But this is a somewhat narrow and technical mode of discussion for the decision of an alleged constitutional right. The
broad ground in a case like this is that, in view of the subject
matter, the legislature is not making promises, but framing a
scheme of public revenue and public improvement. In announcing its policy and providing for carrying it out it may
open a chance for benefits to those who comply with its conditions, but it does not address them, and therefor it makes no
promise to them. It simply indicates a course of conduct to
be pursued, until circumstances or its views of policy change.
It would be quite intolerable if parties not expressly addressed
were to be allowed to set up a contract on the strength of their
interest in and action on the faith of a statute, merely because
their interest was obvious and their action likely, on the face
of the law. What we have said is enough to show that in our
opinion the plaintiff never had a contract, and therefore makes
it unnecessary to consider the usual power to alter, amend or
repeal charters, etc., contained in the constitution of Michigan,
Tomlinson v. .essup, 15 Wall. 454; Covington v. Kentucky, 173
U. S.231; Citizens' Savings Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S.636,
or a similar power in the general railroad law of 1873, of which
the above acts of 1893 and 1897 were amendments through
intervening amending acts.
We need say but a word in answer to the suggestion that
the tax is an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce. In form the tax is a tax on "the property and busi-

STATE BOARD OF ASSESSORS v. COMPTOIR NATIONAL
D'ESCOMPTE.
APPEAL FROI THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 167. Argued October 28,29,1903.-Decided November 30,1903.
There is no inhibition in the Federal Constitution against the right of a
State to tax property in the shape of credits where the same are evidenced
by notes or obligations held within the State, in the hands of an agent of
the owner for the purpose of collection or renewal, with a view to new
loans and carrying on such transactions as a permanent business.
A foreign corporation, whose business in Louisiana was in the hands of an
agent, furnished to customers sums of money and took from them collateral security; for reasons satisfactory to the parties, instead of taking
the ordinary evidence of indebtedness, the customers drew checks, never
intended to be paid in the ordinary way, but intended by the parties to
be held as evidence of the amount of money actually loaned; these loans
could be satisfied by partial payments from time to time, interest being
.charged upon the outstanding amounts, and if not paid at maturity the
collateral was subject to sale ; when paid, the money might be again
loaned by the agent to other parties, or remitted to the home office, and
the business was large and continuing in its character.
Held, that as such checks were given for the purpose of evidencing interestbearing debts, they were the evidence of credit for money loaned, localized in Louisiana, protected by its laws, and properly taxable there under
the provisions of the tax law of 1898 of Louisiana, which has already
