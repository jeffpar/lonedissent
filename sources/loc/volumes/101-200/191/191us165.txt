Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

MISSOURI v. DOCKERY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 180. Argued October 27, 1903.-Decided November 16,1903.
The rights of an individual under the Fourteenth Amendment turn on the
power of the State. A State does not infringe his rights under that
amendment by exempting a corporation from a tax either wholly or in.
part, whether such exemption results from the plain language of a statute
or from the conduct of a state official under it.

THE facts appear in the opinion of the court.

error.
the brief, for plaintiff in
As to power to issue writs of mandamus and functions of
writ, see § 3, Art. VI, Const., and § 4301, R. S. Missouri; State
v. Weeks, 93 Missouri, 499; State v. Rombauer, 104 Missouri,
619; State v. Fraker, 166 Missouri, 130, 140; State v. Renick,
157 Missouri, 292, 298; State v. St. Louis, 145 Missouri, 551,
577; State v. Joplin Water Works, 52 Missouri App. 312; 19
Am. & Eng. Ene. 2d ed. 725, and cases cited. Such writ
is remedial. State v. Lewis, 76 Missouri, 370; State v. Fraker,
166 Missouri, 130,140; High's Extraordinary Legal Remedies,
3d ed. see. 430. It may be addressed to a court or other body
or the individuals composing either, or to both of them. St.
Louis County v. Sparks, 10 Missouri, 117, 120; State v. Public
Schools, 134 Missouri, 296, 297; State v. School Board, 131
Missouri, 505, 511; State Board of Equalization v. The People,
191 Illinois, 528. The proper mode of testing the sufficiency
of an alternative writ of mandamus is by a motion to quash
such writ. State v. Cook, 171 Missouri, 348, 354; State v.
Everett, 52 Missouri, 89, 93. On a motion to quash or a demurrer, all facts sufficiently pleaded are thereby admitted.

is not a suit against a State but against its officers to compel
them to exercise a discretion vested in them by its laws. Smyth

22; Ex parte Skaggs, 19 Missouri, 339; Lewis v. Price, 11 Missouri, 398; Merrill on Mandamus, sec. 306. And a writ or
error lies from this court to the Supreme Court of Missouri,
on a refusal by the latter to issue such writ. Missouriv. Lewis,

an action in mandamus against a public officer to compel him
to perform his official public duty. State v. Public Schools,

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mandamus will lie to compel the Board to reassemble after
adjournment and perform the duty it should have, but failed,
to perform. State v. Berg, 76 Missouri, 136, 143; State v. Trigg,
72 Missouri, 365; State v. Public Schools, 134 Missouri, 296, 304;
State v. Stucky, 78 Mo. App. 533, 545; Lowenthal v. The People,

Illinois, 288, 292; People v. Schiellien, 95 N. Y. 124, 133; People
v. Board of Registration, 17 Michigan, 427; Lewis v. Commissioners, 16 Kansas, 102, 106; State v. Hill, 20 Nebraska, 119.
An application made before the day of adjournment would
have been premature and properly refused. State v. Associated Press, 159 Missouri, 410, 421; Lowenthal v. The People,
192 Illinois, 222, 232; High's Ext. Leg. Reins. 3d ed. sec. 12.
Besides the writ would not abate, but might go against their
successors in office. State v. Walbridge, 153 Missouri, 194, 204;
State Board of Equalizationv. The People, 191 Illinois, 528, 541.
Under the plenary provisions of sec. 9356, R. S. Missouri, 1899,
it would not be necessary to reconvene said Board.
Mandamus does not lie to control the discretion of a court
board of public officers, but to compel its exercise in cases
where it was not exercised, or where it was exercised in such
a manner as to amount to a virtual refusal to exercise it. State
v. Talty, 166 Missouri, 529, 560; State v. St. Louis, 158 Missouri,
505, 514; State v. PublicSchools, 134 Missouri, 296, 311; Statev.
State Board of Health, 103 Missouri, 22, 29. Mandamus lies
to compel an officer to perform his duty, and levy a tax where
he fails or refuses to perform it. State v. Tracy, 94 Missouri,
217; State v. Riley, 85 Missouri, 156; State v. Byers, 67 Missouri,
706. Also to compel a State Board of Equalization to assess
property. State v. Severance, 55 Missouri, 378, 384; State
Board v. People, 191 Illinois, 528, 531; Merrill on Mandamus,
sec. 527, and cases cited; Brown v. Oneida County, 103 Wisconsin, 149, 159. A State Board of Equalization, which wilfully makes an assessment that is grossly inadequate, may be
compelled by mandamus to make a valid assessment. State

By the averments in the petition and alternative writ, that
the Board failed to ascertain and assess the total cash value
of said assessable property, or of said corporations but made
pretended assessments of the same which were grossly inadequate, fraudulent and not uniform and from twenty-five to
forty-eight per cent of the cash value of the property so assessed, as against an assessment of the full cash value of the
property of relator, which was a gross abuse of their discretion and an evasion of their positive duty, therebg largely
increasing the tax to be paid by relator and all other taxpayers of St. Louis.
The case at bar is brought within the rulings of this court
denying to persons the equal protection of the laws. Cummings v. National Bank, 101 U. S. 153; Supervisors v. Stanley,

Under Art. 4, § 16, Const. of Missouri and act of March 9,1901,
p. 232, respondents, as a state board of equalization, constitute
a judicial body vested with discretionary powers, and there being no provision made by statute for appeal from their decisions, their jurisdiction in the matter of assessing property is
exclusive, and no act of this body in such connection is subject to review by any court. Hagar v. Reclamation District,

Opinion of the Court.

111 U. S. 701, 710; Manchester v. Furnald,71 N. H. 153; State
ex rel. Gottlieb v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 165 Missouri,
502; National Bank v. Kimball, 103 U. S. 732; Stanley v. Supervisors, 121 U. S. 535.
Respondents have taken action in the premises; their discretion has been exercised. Relator seeks by mandamus not
merely to compel this quasi judicial body to act, but to compel a revision of the finding of said body, that they may arrive
at a different result.
Mandamus will not lie for such a purpose. This remedy is
effective to require such a body to take action, but cannot be
used to direct the course which it must pursue or the result
which it must reach in the exercise of its discretion.
The fact that no provision is made for appeal for writ of
error in this case does not justify the court in undertaking to
review the finding in a mandamus proceeding. In re Rice, 155
U. S. 396; State Board v. Goggin, 61 N. E. Rep. 339, distinguished.
It is not the duty of the board to make any assessment on
express companies, it being provided by a statute of the State
that in lieu of taxes they pay one and one-fourth per cent
of their gross receipts. Rev. Stat. Missouri, 1899, sec. 9400,
vol. II, p. 2184. This statute has been declared constitutional, and upheld by this court. Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, 142 U. S. 339.
MR. JUSTICE

HOLMS delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri,
upon a judgment quashing an alternative writ of mandamus
to the state board of equalization. The petition alleges that
the board, instead of assessing the total actual cash value of
the taxable property of certain railroad, bridge, telephone,
telegraph and express companies, made pretended, fraudulent, inadequate and not uniform assessments upon such property at valuations varying from about a quarter to forty-eight

per cent of the actual value, except that of the express companies, which they did not assess at all. It alleges that in
this way the petitioner will be deprived of his property without due process of law and will be denied the equal protection
of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States. The motion to quash denied the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Missouri to issue
the writ, and also the sufficiency of the grounds on which the
writ was allowed. The court sustained the motion without
an opinion or statement of reasons.
For all that appears, the court may have quashed the writ
on grounds of local practice. But if this consideration be laid
on one side, it is impossible to say that the board of equalization has not acted with regard to those companies which it
has assessed. It has laid a substantial tax upon them. Its
judgment is final under the Missouri constitution and statutes. Mo. Const. Art. X, § 18; Rev. Stat. §§ 9344,9356, c. 149,
art. 8, March 9, 1901, Stat. 1901, p. 232. If, nevertheless, we
assume that mandamus would lie upon a clear case of fraud
adequately alleged and proved, State Board of Equalization v.
People, 191 Illinois, 528, 539, it would be a strong thing to
revise the judgment of the board on the strength of allegations of undervaluations, and the single adjective "fraudulent" without more specific allegations of fact. State v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 165 Missouri, 502, 516, 517; State v.
Talty, 166 Missouri, 529, 560; Manchester v. Furnald,71 N. H.
153, 158; Knight v. Thomas, 93 Maine, 494; Maish v. Arizona,
164 U. S. 599, 611; Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis
Ry. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 421, 434, 438. See Fogg v. Blair,
139 U. S. 118, 127.
However this may be, the petitioner admitted at the argument that his own tax was correct, and that he would have
had no case under the Fourteenth Amendment if the companies had been exempted altogether. Magoun v. Illinois
Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283, 293-295; Connolly v.
Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 562. But his rights

under that amendment turn on the power of the State, no
matter by what organ it acts. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U1. S.
313, 318. Therefore, if the Supreme Court of the State construed the statutes as exempting express companies from this
tax and substituting another, as it is argued on behalf of the
defendants in error that the statutes do, the petitioner cannot
complain here. For the legislature could exempt them, and
the question whether it has done so or not is for the state courts
to decide in their construction of its acts. Furthermore, if
the State could grant a total exemption it could grant a partial exemption, and if it has done so, de facto, through its officers, the petitioner cannot come here on an allegation that the
officers acted as they did without the authority of the State.
That again is for the state court to decide. The petitioner
has no case under the Constitution of the United States, and
nothing else is open. This is a writ of error to a state court,
so that questions under the state constitution and laws cannot
be considered as they might be on error to a subordinate court
of the United States.

A State may not impose a tax which is in any way a burden upon interstate

in interstate commerce for carrying on that part of their business which is
wholly within the taxing State and which tax does not affect their interstate business or their right to carry it on in that State.
