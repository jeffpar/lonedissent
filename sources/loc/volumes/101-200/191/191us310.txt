HIBBEN v. SMITH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 59. Argued November 6, 1903.-Deeided November 30, 1903.
The amount of benefits resulting from an improvement, and assessed under
a state statute which this (ourt has declared to be constitutional is a
question of fact, and a hearing upon it being assumed, the decision of
- the board making the assessment is final and no Federal question arises.
In the apportionment of assessments for improvements due process of law is
afforded to the taxpayer if he is given an opportunity to be heard before
the body making the assessment; and, so far as the Federal Constitution
is concerned, the state legislature may provide that such hearing shall
be conclusive.
Whether a judgment in a state court based on an assessment is void or only
voidable because some of the members of the board were residents of,
and taxpayers in, the assessment district is a proper question for the
state courts to decide, and after the highest court of the State has held
that the judgment is not void and cannot be attacked collaterally, this
court will follow that determination.

THE plaintiff in error seeks by this writ to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, affirming a
judgment in favor of one of the defendants in error, William C.
Smith, foreclosing the lien of an assessment levied upon certain real estate in the town of Irvington, belonging to the
plaintiff in error. The plaintiff Smith brought this action to
foreclose the lien, and alleged in his complaint that he was the
contractor for the doing of the work for a local improvement
on Washington street in the town mentioned, and had complied with all the provisions of the statute and with his con-

tract, and had finished the work and was entitled to payment
for the same; that an assessment to provide for such payment
had been duly imposed by the board of town trustees, upon
the property abutting on the portion of the street where the
improvement was made, and that the defendant Sarah A.
Hibben was the owner of lots abutting on that improved portion of the street, and her assessment amounted to over five
thousand dollars, which she had not paid; that the assessment
was then due with six per centum interest, and the plaintiff
prayed that the lien might be foreclosed against her property,
and that it might be sold for the satisfaction of the assessment,
and for other proper relief in the premises.
fThe defendant Hibben demurred to the complaint, and
the same having been overruled, she filed an answer thereto.
She also filed a cross complaint. The answer and cross complaint set up the same facts in substance and they both averred
the unconstitutionality of the act of the legislature of Indiana
providing for the improvement of streets under which the improvement in question was made, and also it was objected to
the validity of the assessment that the alleged improvement
was of no benefit to many of her lots, and that, on the contrary, the assessment upon such lots was greater than their
value, and resulted in a substantial confiscation of her property in those lots; also that the assessment had been made by
the front foot and without reference to the benefits received
from the improvement, and that no hearing before the board
of trustees was had and no consideration given to the question
of whether or not the abutting property or any part thereof
was specially benefited in an amount equal to, less than or in
excess of the amounts fixed by the assessments which were
confirmed by such board, but on the contrary that the assessments were made and confirmed upon the theory and belief
that the statutes of the State established the rule of assessment at the same fixed price per lineal front foot on each side
for the whole improvement, and that no change could be made
therein by the board of trustees, and that the board refused at

191 U. S.

such hearings to hear or consider any objection to the assessment based upon any inquiry into the amount of special benefit
accruing to any abbutting lot or parcel of land.
It was also averred in the answer and in the cross complaint
that all the members of the board of trustees of the town of
Irvington were residents of that town and taxpayers therein,
and that two members of the board were owners of lots abutting
upon said improvement and assessed therefor at the same rate
per lineal front foot as the others, and it was averred that no
assessment could legally be levied by such a board of trustees,
and the assessment was for that reason wholly void.
These defences contained in the answer and which were also
set up in the cross complaint, were severally demurred to by
the complainant Smith, and the demurrers sustained, and upon
the refusal of the defendant Hibben to amend, judgment enforcing the lien was entered, which, upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Indiana, was affirmed.

IV. Due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires
that no man shall be judge in his own cause.
Plaintiff claims while town trustees may apportion and determine the special benefits of a local assessment the benefits
must be apportioned and determined by due process of law;
and that among the certain established and recognized maxims
of right that are guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, is
that no man shall be a judge in his own cause. The old maxims
show that this is essential. Coke, Litt. 141a; Broom Max.
(8th Am. ed.) 116; Littleton, § 212; Earl of Derby's case, 12
Coke, 114; Jenk. Cent. Cas. 40; Pandect's Pass. II, lib. 5, 17.
If the duty to be exercised'is of such a judicial character that
under the influence of his interest in the subject matter the
judge may so decide as to give to himself an unjust or inequitable advantage and perforce impose upon other parties a corresponding inequity or disadvantage, it is a case where the
constitutional guaranty of due process of law is applicable.

not spring from the fact that the judge is a citizen, inhabitant
and taxpayer of the city, but from the circumstance that he
owns property within the city which may or may not be liable
to taxation as he may decide. The authorities agree that in
such a case the citizen and taxpayer is disqualified. City of
Oakland v. Oakland Water Front Co., 118 California, 249; State

Texas, 520; State v. City of Cisco (Tex. Civ.), 33 S. W. Rep. 244;
Jefferson Co., etc., v. Milwaukee Co., etc., 20 Wisconsin, 139.
The disqualification is applicable to all officers and boards
whose duties are judicial. Elliott on Muncp. Corporations,
§ 130; Markley v. Rudy, 115 Indiana, 533; Meyer v. Shields, 61
Fed. Rep. 713, 723; Stockwell v. Township Board of White
Lake, 22 Michigan, 341; Conklin v. Squire, 29 Weekly Law
Bull. 157.
Had one of the appellees brought suit against the town to
determine and collect the cost of paving the street crossings,
and all the members of this town board had been on the jury,
either plaintiff or defendant could have challenged them for
cause, for the reason that they were residents and taxpayers
of the town. Hem v. City of Greensburg, 51 Indiana, 119;
Town of Albion v. Hetrick, 90 Indiana, 545, 549; City of Goshen
v. England, 119 Indiana, 368; Gaff v. State, 155 Indiana, 277.
Necessity does not cure this defect except in general and
universal questions which do not apply to this case. Board of
Com. of Fountain Co. v. Loeb, 68 Indiana, 29; State v. Crane, 36
N. J. L. 394, 400; Moses v. Julian, 45 N. H. 52; 84 Am. Dec.

Nor is the legislature the final judge of this necessity.
To say that the legislature is the final judge in all cases of
what interest will disqualify, would be to repudiate all our
constitutions, both 'written and unwritten, and to leave the
citizen at the mercy of every legislative whim and caprice.

The judgment rendered under such circumstances is void
-not voidable and can be attacked collaterally. Sanborn v.

The only reason given for denying the right to collaterally
attack the judgment of interested tribunals is that the complaining party should either take a change of venue to an impartial tribunal or attack the judgment directly by appeal or
writ of error. Bradley v. City of Frankfort,99 Indiana, 417;

Argument for Defendants in Error.

That this statute of Indiana is not unconstitutional has been
repeatedly decided in Indiana. Adams v. Shelbyville, 154
Indiana, 467; Leeds v. Defrees, 61 N. E. Rep. 930; Shank v.
Smith, 61 N. E. Rep. 932; Martinv. Willis, 60 N. E. Rep. 1021;
Schaeffer v. Werling, 156 Indiana, 704, affirmed 188 U. S. 516.
The decision of the state Supreme Court will be followed.
French v. Barber Asphalt Co., 181 U. S. 328; Gilman v.
Sheboygan, 2 Black. 510; Whitman Co. v. Buffalo, 118 Fed.
Rep. 773; Gallup v. Schmidt, 183 U. S. 306, 307.
This court will not again consider a question it has directly
and specifically decided. Swope v. Lefingwell, 15 Otto, 3;
Foster v. Kansas, 112 U. S. 201.
The procedure of the trustees cannot render the statute
unconstitutional. Cummings v. Bank, 101 U. S. 153.
The decision of the state court rests on a ground of estoppel
or waiver of rights which is broad enough to support the decision, hence a Federal question, if raised, will not be considered. Schaeffer v. Werling, supra; Gillisv. Stinchfield, 159 U. S.
658; Pittsburg, etc., Co. v. Cleveland, etc., Co., 178 U. S. 280;
Peirce v. Somerset Ry. Co., 171 U. S. 641, 648.
The decision of the state court holds that plaintiff in error
had a remedy under the laws of the State and failed to invoke
the same. Smith v. Shank, 61 N. E. Rep. 932.
In Indiana a remedy by injunction exists to prevent any action by interested trustees. Board v. Justice, 133 Indiana, 95.
A petition for injunction before action is an adequate and
direct remedy. A defence of the character here made after
judgment or assessment is a collateral attack. Jackson v.
Smith, 120 Indiana, 521; Johnson v. State, 116 Indiana, 375;
Kiphart v. R. R. Co., 7 Ind. App. 124; Jackson v. State, 104
Indiana, 516.
The state court construes such a judgment to be voidable
only. Board v. Justice, supra.
No Federal question is involved in the construction by the
state court of a state judgment. Newport Co. v. Newport, 151

U. S. 527.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

The rule that objection to the competency of an officer to
pass on a question of a judicial nature must be made at the
earliest opportunity or is waived, is a matter of state practice
and local law, and as such does not infringe any right under
the Federal Constitution. Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71.
This is an established rule of practice in Indiana. Baldwin
v. Runyon, 8 Ind. App. 348; Bradley v. Frankfort, 99 Indiana,
417, and cases cited therein.
If it be found that the state court opinion does not cover the
matter of alleged incompetency of trustees, then the court did
v.
not decide this question and committed no error. Schaeffer

Schaeffer v. Werling, supra, has been affirmed upon writ of
error by this court, 188 U. S. 516, where it was held that the
statute in question was not in conflict with the Constitution
of the United States, and the principle was reiterated in that
case that the construction placed by the highest court of a
State upon a statute providing for paving the streets and distributing the assessment therefor was conclusive upon this
court. See also Merchants & Manufacturers' Bank v. Pennsylvania, 167 U. S. 461.
The amount of benefits resulting from the improvement is a
question of fact, and a hearing upon it being assumed, the decision of the board is final. No constitutional question of a
Federal nature arises therefrom.
If the board of trustees refuse to hear the owners of property
abutting the street improvement, in regard to the subject of
benefits, and arbitrarily proceed to levy the assessment solely
according to the front foot, the Supreme Court of Indiana has
held that such lot owner was not without remedy, and that
he could by mandamus or injunction compel a hearing as to
the amount of the assessment upon each lot, or prevent the
approval of the engineer's report until such hearing had been
accorded, and that the lot owner could not waive such a remedy
and make the denial of a hearing available as a defence in an
action to collect the assessment. Shank v. Smith, supra.
Under the cases above cited this court follows the decision of
the Supreme Court of Indiana upon this question of remedy.
The claim set up on the part of the lot owner, that there can
be no due process of law under which an assessment can be
made which does not provide for a review of such assessment
and a hearing by a court, is not tenable. Assuming the necessity of a hearing before an assessment can be made conclusive, the law may provide for that hearing by the body which
levies the assessment, and after such hearing may make the
decision of that body conclusive. Although in imposing such

assessments the common council or board of trustees may be
acting somewhat in a judicial character, yet the foundation
of the right to assess exists in the taxing power, and it is not
necessary that in imposing an assessment there shall be a
hearing before a court provided by the law in order to give
validity to such assessment. Due process of law is afforded
where there is opportunity to be heard before the body which
is to make the assessment, and the legislature of a State may
provide that such hearing shall be conclusive so far as the
Federal Constitution is concerned.
In FallbrookIrrigationDistrictv. Bradley, 164 U. S. 112, 168,
it was said that"Due process of law is not violated, and the equal protection
of the laws is given, when the ordinary course is pursued in
such proceedings for the assessment and collection of taxes
that has been customarily followed in the State, and where the
party who may subsequently be charged in his property has
had a hearing, or an opportunity for one provided by the
statute."
And it was also said in that case that whether a review is or
is not given upon any of these questions of fact, (that is, as to
benefits and the amounts of the assessments,) was a mere
question of legislative discretion, so long as the tribunal created
by the State had power to decide them, and the opportunity
for a hearing was given by the act, and that it was not constitutionally necessary in such case to give a rehearing or an
appeal.
In Spring Valley Water Works v. Schottler, 110 U. S. 347,
where the law provided for the fixing of water rates by a board
of supervisors after a hearing, and without any right of review
by any court, it was stated (at page 354) by Mr. Chief Justice
Waite, giving the opinion of the court:
"Like every other tribunal established by the legislature for
such a purpose, their duties are judicial in their nature, and
they are bound in morals and in law to exercise an honest
judgment as to all matters submitted for their official deter-

Opinion of the Court.

mination. It is not to be presumed that they will act otherwise than according to this rule." See Spencer v. Merchant,
125 U. S. 345.
The sole remaining question arises upon the allegations
contained in the answer and cross complaint, that all the
members of the board of trustees were residents of the town
and taxpayers therein, and that two members of the board
were owners of lots abutting upon the improvement, and
assessed therefor at the same rate as the others.
The objection to the tribunal constituted by the legislature
of Indiana, which the plaintiff in error makes in this particular
instance, is that it results in making a person a judge in his
own case, and that hence any judgment of a tribunal thus
constituted is absolutely void, and may be attacked, as it is
attacked in this case, collaterally. It is said that to impose
an assessment, which is the same as a judgment under such
circumstances is to take the lot owner's property without due
process of law, and violates thereby the Federal Constitution.
We think the first objection, that all of the members of the
board of trustees were residents of and taxpayers in the town,
is wholly unimportant. We have not the slightest doubt of
the power of a legislature of a State, unless hampered by some
special constitutional provision, to create a tribunal in a city
or town, such as the common council or board of trustees, to
make an assessment, and that such assessment would be valid,
notwithstanding the fact that every member of the board was
a taxpayer of the city or the town. It is a matter of legislative
discretion as to how such a board shall be constituted, and we
hazard nothing in saying that it is quite common throughout
the country for the legislatures of the States to create a tribunal
for levying assessments for local improvements in a manner
precisely like the case in question. It is not at all analogous,
even in principle, to a judge of a court acting in a case in which
he is personally interested.
To say that no one who was a taxpayer in a city or town
could act in imposing an assessment upon property therein is

OCTOBER TERMt, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

to say that the legislature is wholly without power, by reason
of the Federal Constitution, to constitute a tribunal- to make
an assessment where such tribunal is composed of taxpayers
in the city or town. This we do not believe. It must frequently happen'that a board of assessors for a city, to assess
all property for general taxation, will be composed of men who
themselves own property in the city and assess the same for
purposes of such taxation. Can there be any doubt of the
validity of the general assessments under such circumstances?
And would not the assessment for taxation of the property of
the individual members of the board of assessors, made by the
board, be valid if authorized by the statute? See Brown v.
Massachusetts, 144 U. S. 573, citing 147 Massachusetts, 585,
591; 150 Massachusetts, 334, 343.
Then as to the averment that there were two members of
the board who were owners of lots abutting upon the improvement and were assessed therefor at the same rate as other lot
owners. Although it might have been more seemly for those
two members, if they recollected the fact of such ownership,
to have refused to act in the matter, yet there is nothing to
show that their attention was called to the fact, nor does it
appear that any objection was made by plaintiff in error or
any one else to their acting, nor that the plaintiff in error was
ignorant of their interest at the time when the proceedings
were commenced. The state court has held that an assessment for improvements under this statute of Indiana is in the
nature of a judgment, and the fact that members of the board
who levied the assessment owned property, as stated, would
not render the judgment void, but at most, voidable, and that
it could not be attacked collaterally. The cases of Bradley v.
City of Frankfort, 99 Indiana, 417; Jackson v. Smith, 120 Indiana, 520, and Board of Commissioners v. Justice et al., 133
Indiana, 89, are referred to.
Whether a judgment obtained in a case like this, where two
members of a general board created by statute for the purpose
of making it, had some interest in some of the property subject

HIBBEN v. SMITH.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to the assessment, was a void or voidable judgment, is a proper
question for the state court to decide. A state court has the
right to place its own construction upon its own judgments,'
and where, as in a case like this, it holds that the judgment is
not void and that it cannot be attacked collaterally, we ought
to follow that determination. Newport Light Co. v. Newport,
151 U. S. 527, 539.
In Lent v. Tillson, 140 U. S. 316, which was an assessment
case, it was stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the
opinion of the court, (p. 333) as follows:
"Other objections have been urged by the plaintiffs which
we do not deem it necessary to consider. For instance, it is
said that the mayor of the city of San Francisco, one of the
Board of Commissioners, was himself the owner of a lot on
Dupont street, and, for that reason, was incompetent to act
as one of the board of street commissioners. . . . In respect to all these and like objections, it is sufficient to say that
they do not necessarily involve any question of a Federal nature,
and so far as this court is concerned, are concluded by the
decision of the Supreme Court of California."
The provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment do not cover
such an objection as is now under consideration. The general
system of procedure for the levying and collection of taxes
which is established in this country is, within the meaning of
the Constitution, due process of law. Kelly v. Pittsburgh, 104
U. S. 78. A provision made by the legislature of a State in
relation to the manner of levying an assessment for a local
improvement is within this principle a proceeding for the levying and collection of taxes, and unless it be in violation of some
particular provision of the Federal Constitution, it will be
upheld in this court. The Fourteenth Amendment, it has been
held, legitimately operates to extend to the citizens and residents of the States the same protection against arbitrary state
legislation, affecting life, liberty and property, as is offered by
the Fifth Amendment against similar legislation by Congress;
but that the Federal courts ought not to interfere when what

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

is complained of amounts to the enforcement of the laws of a
State applicable to all persons in like circumstances and conditions, and that the Federal courts should not interfere unless
there is some abuse of law amounting to confiscation of property or a deprivation of personal rights, such as existed in the
case of Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269.
These principles have been reiterated in a series of cases
reported in 181 U. S., commencing with French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., at page 324 of that volume.
The facts contained in the objection now under discussion do
not, in our judgment, constitute any violation of the Federal
Constitution or result in the taking of the property of the plaintiff in error without due process of law, as that term is understood, when used in the Constitution of the United States.
We see no error in the record in this case which we can review,
and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is
Affirmed.
MR. JUsTIcE WHITE concurred in the result.

CIRCUIT.
No. 67. Submitted November 10, 1903-Decided November301903.

Where it appears by an examination of the entire charge to the jury that
the court understood the true rule as to defendant's liability and the jury
were informed of the limitations thereon, no exceptions being taken except to a single detached remark, and no request being made to the court
to restate the rule with his attention called to the defective portion of
his charge, the judgment will not be reversed because in certain detached
and incidental remarks made in regard to defendant's liability the court
failed to state the proper limitation of liability, it also appearing that
the remarks were used under such circumstances as made it absolutely
certain that the jury was not misled thereby.
