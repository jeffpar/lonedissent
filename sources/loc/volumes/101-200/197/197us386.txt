UNITED STATES v. SMITH.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 184. Argued March 15, 1905-Decided April, 3,1905.
The word "arrest" as employed in Article 43 of § 1624, Rev. Stat., requiring
service of the charge on which the accused is to be tried by court martial,
does not relate to the preliminary arrest or detention of an accused
person awaiting the action of higher authority to frame charges and
specifications and order a court-martial, but to the arrest resulting from
preferring the charges by the proper authority, and the convening of a

court-martial.
The provision in Article 38 of § 1624, Rev. Stat., that no commander of a
fleet or squadron shall convene a general court-martial without express
authority from the President was enacted in 1862 and will be construed

as intending to apply to waters within the continental limits of the United
States, and not to waters in the territory beyond the seas acquired since
the passage of that act, and the acquisition whereof was not contemplated at that time.

May 26, 1899, John Smith was serving under enlistment
as a fireman of the fii'st class on board the United States naval
vessel Yorktown, then at anchor in Iloilo harbor, Philippine
Islands. On the date named Smith was reported to the commanding officer of the Yorktown as having refused to do duty,
and consequently such officer ordered him "put under sentries
as a prisoner in single irons for safekeeping to await trial by a
general court-martial." Subsequently, on June 30. 1899,
Rear Admiral Watson, the Commander in Chief of the United
ON

UNITED STATES v. SMITH.
197 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

States naval force on the Asiatic station, convened a general
court-martial, to meet on July 3, 1899, for the purpose of
trying accused persons who might be legally brought before
the court, and on the same day a charge was preferred against
Smith, by the Rear Admiral, accompanied with a specification, for refusing to obey a lawful order of his superior officer.
Smith, who as already stated had been placed under arrest
on May 26, 1899, was served on July 1, 1899, with a copy of
the charge and specification which had been preferred against
him and an extra watch was put over him as well as over other
prisoners who were being held for trial. On July 5, 1899,
Smith was sent under guard before the court-martial. He
was tried, found guilty and sentenced "To be confined in such
place as the Secretary of the Navy may direct for a period of
one year, to perform extra police duties during such confinement, to lose all pay that may become due him during such
confinement, except the sum of three dollars ($3.00) per month
for necessary prison expenses, and a further sum of twenty
dollars to be paid him at the expiration of his term of confinement, when he shall be dishonorably discharged from the
United States Navy."
The term of imprisonment prescribed in the sentence was
somewhat mitigated by the Secretary of the Navy. Thereafter, on being released, Smith sued in the Court of Claims to
recover the pay which would have been earned by him had he
been entitled to receive the same during the period covered
by the sentence. The right to recover was based on the averment that a copy of the charge had not been served on Smith
when he was originally put under arrest on May 26, 1899, it
being claimed that for this reason the judgment of the courtmartial was void. After finding the facts as above recited
the Court of Claims concluded, as matter of law, that the
claimant was entitled to recover, and from the judgment
entered upon such finding the Government appealed.

and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradt, with whom Mr.
Special Attorney Felix Brannigan was on the brief, for the
United States:
The delivery to the prisoner on July 1, 1899, of the true
copy of the charge and specification of the offense committed
on May 26, 1899, and for which he was tried, convicted and
sentenced on July 5, 1899, by a general court-martial, was
a sufficient compliance with Article 43 of the articles which
govern the Navy of the United States. Rev. Stat. § 1624.
The judgment appealed from is founded upon an unreasonable
interpretation of Article 43. "It rests upon a construction which
is too literal." United States v. Finnell, 185 U. S. 236, 242. It
well illustrates the maxim, "Qui haeretin litera,haeretin cortice."
The Court of Claims ha' no jurisdiction whatever to review
the lawful sentence of any duly convened court-martial, nor
to impugn by doubts the verity of its record or justice of its
sentence. In this country courts-martial are courts of record
-so far, at least, as the statute requires records to be made
and preserved. Like our inferior courts they derive their
jurisdiction from and are regulated by Congress, Dynes v.
Hoover, 20 How. 65, 82; and no civil court can review their
proceedings or sentences, Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193. They
have general jurisdiction of all military offenses. The act of
Congress, passed more than a hundred years ago, requires the
president of every court-martial to administer an oath to the
judge advocate that he will "keep a true record of the evidence
given to and the proceedings of this court;

Neither the sentences of these military courts, nor the action
of the Admiral or the Secretary of the Navy or of the President
upon them, should ever be regarded as void by that civil court,
except perhaps upon the very clearest jurisdictional grounds
when the court-martial case was coram non judice. Wise v.
Withers, 3 Cr. 331, 337. When general courts-martial are
convened by the Secretary of the Navy, or by the Commander
in Chief of a fleet or squadron, in contemplation of law they
are convened by the President himself as Commander in Chief
of the Navy. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; Eliason

Article 43 "the person accused shall be furnished with a true
copy of the charges, with the specifications, at the time he is
put under arrest; and no other. charges than those so furnished
shall be urged against him at the trial." This rule was therefore
inexcusably violated. It necessarily follows that if the accused
can be tried only upon the charge furnished at the time of his
arrest, if no charges were furnished him at the time of his
arrest for trial, on May 26, 1899, there were none in existence
upon which he could have been legally tried on July 5, 1899.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
Article 43 of section 1624 of the Revised Statutes, upon
which the Court of Claims based its legal conclusion that the
action of the court-martial in question was void because the
charge and specification were not served upon the claimant
at the time of the original arrest, reads as follows: "The person
accused shall be furnished with a true copy of the charges,
with the specifications, at the time he is put under arrest."
It is conceded by the findings that at once when the charge
and specification were formulated by Rear Admiral Watson
and the court-martial was ordered to be convened, a copy of
the charge and specification was served upon Smith. It is
also established by the findings that no objection as to tardiness of service was made at the time of trial. Conceding,
arguendo solely, and without so deciding, that under these
circumstances the objection as to the lateness of the service
was jurisdictional and could be collaterally inquired into, we
think the contention is wholly devoid of merit. Nearly ten
years before the trial in question was had, in the year 1890,
the Secretary of the Navy submitted to the Attorney General
the question of whether the arrest referred to in Article 43
related to the preliminary arrest which might be consequent
upon the commission of an offense, or applied to the. arrest
made after charges had been formulated and as court-martial
ordered. The Attorney General advised that the word arrest
as employed in Article 43 did not relate to the preliminary
arrest or detention of an accused person awaiting the action
of higher authority to frame charges and specifications and
order a court-martial, but to the arrest resulting from the preferring of the charges by the proper authority and the conven-

ing of a court-martial. 19 Opinions of Attorney General, 472.
The reasoning by which the Attorney General reached the
conclusion just stated we think was absolutely conclusive.
Doubtless the opinion became the rule of practice in the Navy,
and the construction affixed by the Attorney General to the
statute was sanctioned by this court in Johnson v. Sayre, 158
U. S. 109, and such construction has been reiterated in an
opinion announced this day. Bishop v. United States, 197
U. S. 334.
Whilst these considerations dispose of the contentions raised
and passed on below, a new ground for reversal was urged at
bar, founded on Article 38 of section 1624 of the Revised
Statutes. That Article reads as follows:
"Art. 38. General courts-martial may be convened by the
President, Secretary of the Navy, or the Commander in Chief
of a fleet or squadron; but no commander of a fleet or squadron
in the waters of the United States shall convene such court
without express authority from the President."
Although it is not denied that Rear Admiral Watson was a
commander of a fleet within the meaning of that expression
as employed in Article 38, it is insisted that as he convened
the court-martial while in Manila Bay, about six weeks after
the treaty with Spain by which the Philippine Islands were
acquired by the United States, therefore the fleet or squadron
under his command was "in the waters of the United States,"
within the meaning of those words as employed in the enactment in question, and there was no power in the Commander
in Chief to convoke a court-martial without express authority
from the President, which is not found to have been given.
This objection, if well taken, is jurisdictional, but in our judgment it is without merit; and we reach this conclusion wholly
irrespective of the status of the Philippine Islands.
The clause in question was originally enacted in 1862, before
even the acquisition of Alaska, and was intended, we think,
to apply to those waters within what was termed by Congress
in the Det of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1107, 1108, the continental

Opinion of the Court.

limits of the United States. In other words, the provision in
question did not take into view the dominion or sovereignty
of the United States over territory beyond the seas and far
removed from the seat of government, but contemplated waters
within the United States in the stricter and popular sense of the
term. Looking to the language used, in the light of the surrounding circumstances and the purpose which it was intended
to accomplish, Platt v. Union Pacific R. R., 99 U. S. 48, 64,
it is, we think, manifest that the prohibition against the convocation by the commander of a fleet or squadron of a general
court-martial, without the previous authorization of the President, was intended to be operative only when the fleet or
squadron was in a home port, as above defined. That is to
say, that Congress contemplated the necessity of an order
from the President when the circumstances supposed to require the convening of the court-martial could be with facility
submitted to the President for his action in the premises. To
give a broad meaning to the expression "waters of the United
States," as employed in Article 38, by construing those words
as referring not only to the home waters but to far distant
waters, would, we think, defeat the plain purposes of Congress
and seriously impair, if not destroy, an important power vested
in the commander of a fleet or squadron- whpn at distant
stations, remote from the home country. Certainly, if .the
remoteness from the continental limits of the United States
is immaterial and the restriction of Article 38 is applicable to
the commander when his fleet or squadron is within waters
thousands of miles removed from the boundaries of the United
States, in the restricted sense of that term, no good reason is
apparent why the commander of a fleet or squadron should not
have been forbidden, without the leave of the President to
convoke a general court-martial, irrespective of where his fleet
or squadron might be situated.
Judgment reversed.
