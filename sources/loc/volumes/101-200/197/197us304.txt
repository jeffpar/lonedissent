McMICHAEL v. MURPHY.
"ERROR TO, AND

APPEAL FROM,

THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE

TERRITORY OF OKLAHOMA.
No.166. Submitted March 7, 1905.-Decided April 3,1905.

A settlement or entry on public land already covered of record by another
entry, valid upon its face, does not give a second entryman any right
in the land notwithstanding the first entry may subsequently be relinquished or ascertained to be invalid by reason of facts dehors the record
of such entry; and one first entering after the relinquishment or cancellation has priority over one attempting to enter prior to such relinquishment or cancellation.
It is the duty of this court in the absence of cogent reasons therefor, not
to overrule the capstruction of a statute upon which the Land Department has uniformly proceeded in its administration of the public lands.

facts in this case may be summarized as follows:
On April 23, April 24 and May 1,.1889, White, Blanchard
and Cook, respectively and in the order named, applied, at the
United States Land Oflice in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory,
to make a homestead entry on certain lands, being part of the
Southwest I of Section 27, Township 12, north of range 3 west.
The applications of Blanchard and Cook were each rejected,
as being in -onflict with White's entry. On April 27, 1889,
Blanchard filed his affidavit of contest charging that White
entered the Territory prior to twelve o'clock noon of April 22,
1889, in violation of the act of Congress approved March 2,
1889, 25 Stat. 980, 1004, c. 412, and the, President's Proclamation issued under that act. 26 Stat. 1544. On May 1, 1889,
Cook also filed an affidavit of contest against White, alleging
the latter's disqualification as above stated, to enter the
land, and also that Blanchard was also disqualified upon the
same grounds as those alleged in reference to White.

tory prior to noon of April 22, 1889,-the Register and Receiver
recommended the cancellation of White's entry, and dismissed
the contest of both Blanchard and Cook. From this decision
all parties appealed to the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and on March 7, 1890, the decision of the local office
was affirmed. An appeal was then taken to the Secretary of
the Interior. While the case was pending before that offiber,
namely, on November 29, 1890, White relinquished of record
his entry, and Murphy, the defendant, on the same day,
entered the land. The Secretary of the Interior, July 21,
1891, affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of the General
Land Office. Blanchard v. White, 13 L. D. 66.
On or about June 3, 1889, White's homestead, entry 6eing
still intact, of record, McMichael entered upon the land with a
view of establishing his residence thereon and initiating a
homestead right to it; and on July 21, 1889, he made application .to the local office to enter the land, tendering the required
fees; but his application was rejected by the local office as
being in conflict with White's entry. From that order no
appeal was taken.
On August 31, 1889, McMichael again tendered his application to the local office with the required fees. That application
was received, but it was suspended pending the contest of
White, Blanchard and Cook. On the day last named McMichael filed a contest or protest, alleging that he had made
settlement on the land on June 3, 1889, had lived there in a
tent with his family until August 2, 1889, when, at the instance
of White, he was forcibly removed therefrom by the military
authorities; that his rights were superior to those of White,
Blanchard and Cook, all of whom, le alleged, were disqualified
by reason of having entered the Territory during the period
prohibited by law; that his application of June 3, was rejected
because it conflicted with White's interests, althougl he was
the only qualified settler on the tract entitled to make entry.
The case, as between McMichael and Murphy, having been
heard on February 15, 1892, a decision was rendered in favor

of the latter. Thereupon McMichael appealed to the General
Land Office which, on January 18, 1893, affirmed the decision
of the local office. He then appealed to the Secretary of the
Interior, and that officer, on February 25, 1895, affirmed the
decision of the Land Office. McMichael v. Murphy, 20 L. D.
147.
A patent was issued to Murphy for the land; whereupon the
present action was brought in the District Court of Oklahoma
County by McMichael against Murphy and his grantees, the
relief asked being a decree declaring the legal title to be held
in trust for the use and benefit of McMichael. Murphy demurred on the ground that the petition (lid not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action-McMichael's claim
being that the Secretary of the Interior had misconstrued and
misapplied the law. The demurrer was sustained, and the
plaintiff having elected to stand on his petition the court dismissed the case. From that decree the plaintiff brings .the
case here for review.
After the cause was entered in the Supreme Court of the
Territory McMichael died and the cause was revived in the
name of his heirs.
Mr. Joseph K. McCammon, Mr. James H. Hayden and
Mr. Frank Clark for plaintiffs in error and appellants:
By his settlement and residence upon the land in dispute
the plaintiff McMichael acquired preferential rights therein,
and his applications to enter the said land were entitled to
priority over the application of the defendaxit Murphy.
McMichael's settlement occurred without resistance or objection and his presence on the land was not unlawful and
gave rise to preferential rights if the pending entries were all

rejected. He knew of the contest and while he made no effort
to enter the land while it was pending he did. enter it as soon
as he knew they were all disqualified. Marks v. Bray, 1 L. D.

In spite of his forcible ejectment McMichael never relinquished the actual possession of part of the land, and never
ceased to claim that he was entitled to acquire the whole of it
as a homestead. Under these circumstances he was, in contemplation of law, in possession of and a settler upon the land
from May 28, 1889, continuously throughout the period covered by the transactions described in his petition. His temporary absence from part of the land, wrongfully compelled by
military force and induced by intimidation, did not break the
continuity of his residence. Dorgan v. Pitt, 6 L. D. 616;

By his contest filed August 31, 1889, by which he attacked
the entry of the def6ndant White and the claims of Blanchard,
the plaintiff McMichael acquired preferential rights, and both

and the one made by him on December 4, 1890, were entitled

The several frauds, conspiracies, perjuries and other unlawful transactions by which the defendant Murphy secured the
legal title to the land in dispute and prevented the plaintiff,
McMichael, from securing the same rendered Murphy's title
void as against McMichael. All of the defendants, having
been either parties to these unlawful transactions, or privy
thereto, must be regarded as having taken, and as holding the
legal title, as trustees for, and should be compelled to convey
the said land to, the heirs of McMichael.

Under the circumstances McMichael's remedy was by petition to a court of equity for the securing and protection of
his rights, which were not cognizable by a court of law. He
was entitled to have it adjudged that Murphy and his grantees
took title as trustees for him; to a decree compelling the defendants to convey the land to him, and to an injunction
restraining the execution of the judgments of ejeetment.

A homestead entry once made upon public land of the
United States under the provisions of sections 2289 and 2290

operates to change the ordinary rule. Chotard v. Pope, 12

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

after making the foregoing siate-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
The particular question involved in this case is whether a
settlement or entry on public land already covered of record
by aother entry, valid upon its face, gives the second entryman any right in the land, notwithstanding the first entry
may subsequently be relinquished or be ascertained to be
invalid by reason of facts dehors the record of such entry.
By virtue of the authority vested in him by acts of Congress,
particularly by the Indian Appropriation act of March 2, 1889,
25 Stat. 1004, c. 412, the President by Proclamation dated
March 23, 1889, declared that certain lands theretofore obtairied from Indians (among which were those in dispute)
would "at and after the hour of twelve o'clock, noon, of the
twenty-second day of April next, and not before, be open for
settlement, under the terms of, and subject to, all the conditions, limitations and restrictions" contained in the above act
and in the laws of the United States applicable thereto. 26

McMICHAEL v. MURPHY.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Stat. 1544. That Proclamation contains the following clause:
"Warning is hereby again expressly given, that no person entering upon and occupying said lands before said hour of
twelve o'clock, noon, of the twenty-second day of April, A. D.
eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, hereinbefore fixed, will ever
be permitted to enter any of said lands or acquire any rights
thereto; and that the officers of the United States will be required to strictly enforce the provision of the act of Congress
to the above effect." 26 Stat. 1544, 1546.
It may be assumed, for the purpose of this case, that White
entered the Territory and occupied the land before noon of
April 22, 1889, in violation of the act of Congress and the
Proclamation of the President. But his entry did not, on its
face or in the papers connected therewith, disclose the fact of
his personal disqualification to make a valid entry. While
the entry remained uncancelled of record by any direct action
of the Land Office or by relinquishment, could another person,
by making an entry, acquire a right in the land upon which a
patent could be based? If not, then McMichael acquired no
right by his entry or application to enter.
The Supreme Court of the Territory held that White's homestead entry was prima facie valid, and that so long as White's
entry remained uncancelled of record it segregated the tract
of land from the mass of the public domain and precluded
McMichael from acquiring an inceptive right thereto by virtue
of his alleged settlement.
We are of opinion that there was no error in this ruling.
It is supported by the adjudged cases. Kansas Pacific Ry.
Co. v. Dunmeyer, 113 U. S. 629; Hastings &c. R. R. v. Whitney,
132 U. S. 357, 361, 362; Sioux City &c. Land Company v.

Gayman, who had made a homestead entry, was disqualified
Ylreason of his having entered the Territory of Oklahoma
inViolation of the above act of Congress and the Proclamation
of the President. The court said:" Gayian's homestead entry
was prima facie valid. There was nothing on the- face of the
record to show that he had entered the Territory prior to the
time fixed for the opening thereof for settlement, or that he
had in any manner violated the statute or the Proclamation
of the President. This prima facie valid entry removed the
land, temporarily at least, out of the public domain, and
beyond the reach of other homestead entries.

.

.

.

Gen-

erally, a homestead entry while it remains uncancelled withdraws the land from subsequent entry. Such has- been the
ruling of the Land Department.

.

.

.

The entry of Gay-

man, though ineffectual to vest any rights in him, and therefore
void as to him, was such ao entry as prevented the acquisition
of homestead rights by another until it had been set Aside."
Following the adjudged cases, we hold that White's original
entry was prima facie valid, that is, valid on the face of the
record, and McMichael's entry, having been made at a time
when White's entry remained uncancelled, or not relinquished,
of record, conferred no right upon him, for the reason that
White's entry, so long as it remained undisturbed, of record,
had the effect to segregate the lands from the public domain
and make them not subject to entiy. Upon White's relinquishment they again became public lands, subject to the
entry made by Murphy.
In addition, it may be observed that the action of the Land
Department under the' statutes relating to the public lands
has been in line with the above views. This appears from the
decision in Hodges v. Colcord, and from the opinion of the
Secretary of the Interior in McMichaet v. Murphy, 20 L. D.
147. It is our duty not to overrule the construction of a statute upon which the Land Department has.uniformly proceeded,
in its administration of the public lands,, except for cogent
reasons. United States. v. Johnston, 124 U. S. 236; United

CHRISMAN v. MILLER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 171. Argued March 8,1905.-Decided April 3, 1905.

This court does not review questions of fact in cases coming from a state
court but accepts the conclusions of the state tribunal as final.
Where an attempted mineral location is a failure by reason of a lack of
discovery and all rights have been conveyed to a third party who formally
relinquishes them, the land is again open to location and the party so
relinquishing may locate it and become entitled thereto by subsequent
discovery, and otherwise complying with the law, without waiting until
the relinquished location lapsed by failure to do the annual work required
by statute.
In controversies between two mineral claimants the rule as to sufficiency
of discovery is more liberal than it is in controversies between a mineral
claimant and an agricultural entryman, as in the latter the land is sought
to be withdrawn from the category of agricultural lands, while in the
former the question is merely one of priority.
While the statute does not prescribe what is necessary to constitute a
discovery under the mining laws of the United States, it is essential
that it gives reasonable evidence of the fact either that there is a vein
or lode carrying precious minerals, or if it be claimed as placer ground
that it is valuable for such mining; and where there is not enough in what
a locator claims to have seen to justify a prudent person in the expenditure
of money and labor in exploitation this court will not overthrow a
finding of the lower court that there was no discovery.

THIS was an action in the Superior Court of Fresno County,
California, to quiet title to certain lands in that county. The
complaint by Miller and The Home Oil Company was filed
October 14, 1898. The case was tried by the court without
