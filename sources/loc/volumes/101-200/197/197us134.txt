CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 413. Argued January 27, 30, 1905.-Decided February 27, 1905.

Under the proviso of § 25 of the act of Congress of August 27, 1898, 28
Stat. 509, 552, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized, when he has
satisfactory evidence that the rupee price of imported goods stated in
the invoice does not mean rupees at bullion value, but as a certain fraction of a pohind sterling, to order a reliquidation so as to make the value
in United States currency correspond with the actual value of the goods.
In determining when the Secretary of the Treasury exceeded his powers
under a statute, this court may consider public- facts that were known
to Congress when enacting the statute and must have been before the
Secretary's mind when acting thereunder, even though such facts were
not proved on the trial.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
