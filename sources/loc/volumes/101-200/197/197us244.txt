HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD
CIRCUIT.
No. 512. Argued March 1, 2, 1905.-Decided March 6, 1905.-Opinion delivered April
3, 1905.

After affirmance of the decree in the Northern Securities case, 193 U. S.
197, adjudging the combination illegal under the Anti-Trust Act the
corporation adopted a resolution reducing itA capital stock and distributing the surplus of assets created by the reduction and consisting of shares
of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway Companies ratably
among its stockholders. Complainants objected to the pro rata distribution and insisted that the Northern Pacific stock they had delivered to the
Securities Company was not so delivered in pursuance of an absolute sale
but to be held in trust; that they were entitled to have their stock returned to them; that the decree in the Government suit practically so
adjudicated and that as they acted in good faith, believing that the
original contract was not within the prohibitions of the Anti-Trust Act,
the doctrine of in pari delicto did not apply.
The Circuit Court granted a temporary injunction against pro rata distri bution and the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order and practically disposed of the entire case adversely to complainants. This
court granted a writ of certiorari. Held, that:
Where the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals in an action in equity,
only reverses an order of the Circuit Court granting an injunction,
but the court, the record presenting the whole case, practically disposes
of the entire controversy on the merits, certiorari may issue from this
court and this court may finally dispose of it by its direction to the
Circuit Court.
The decree of the Circuit Court in the Northern Securities case, affirmed
by this court, 193 U. S. 197, did not determine the quality of the transfer
as between the defendants, and the provisions therein as to return of
shares of stock transferred to it by the railway stockholders were permissive only, and not an adjudication that any of the vendors were
entitled to a restitution of their original railway shares.
The judgment of this court affirming the decree of the Circuit Court in the
Northern Securities case went no further than the decree itself, and while
it leaves the Circuit Court at liberty to proceed in the execution of its
decree as circumstances may require, it does not operate to change the
decree or import a power to do so not otherwise possessed.
General expressions in- an opinion which are not essential to dispose of a
case are not permitted to control the judgment in subsequent suits.

case, 193 U. S. 197, enlarged the scope of the decree of the Circuit Court
so as to make it an'adjudication that any of the vendors of railway
stocks were entitled to judicial restitution of the stocks transferred by
them to the Securities Company, or that the Securities Company could
not distribute the shares of railway stock held by it pro rata between
its own shareholders.
The transaction between complainants and the Northern Securities Company was one of purchase and sale of Northern Pacific Railway Company
stock for shares of stock of the Securities Company and cash and not a
bailment or trust.
When a vendor testifies that the transaction was an unconditional sale
and that he attached to his negotiations no other conditions than that
of price he is estopped from afterwards denying that this is a statement
of fact and claiming that he only swore to a conclusion of law.
Property delivered under an executed illegal contract cannot be recovered
back by any party in pari delicto, and the courts cannot relax the
rigor of this.rule where the record discloses no special considerations of
equity, justice or public policy.
The fact' that the complainants in this case acted in good faith and without intention to violate the law does not exempt them from the doctrine
ofin pari delicto. All the parties having supposed the statute would not
be held applicable to the transaction neither can plead ignorance of the
law as against the other and the defendant secured no unfair advantage
in retaining the consideration voluntarily delivered for the price agreed.
Where 'avendor after transferring shares of railway stock to a corporation
in exchange for its shares becomes a director of the purchasing corporation and participates in acts consistent only with absolute ownership
by it of the railway stocks, and does so after an action has been brought
to declare. the transaction illegal, his right to rescind the contract and
compel restitution of his original railway shares, if it ever existed, is
lost by acquiescence and laches.
The Northern Pacific system taken in connection with the Burlington
system is competitive with the Union Pacific system, and the entire
record considered, to deliver to the complainants, the Northern Pacific
stock claimed by them and distribute the balance of the stock ratably
between the other Securities Company stockholders, would not only be
inequitable but would tend to smother competition and thus contravene
the object of the Sherman law and the purposes of the suit brought by
the Government against the Northern Securities Company.
It was the duty of the Securities Company under the decree in the Government suit to end a situation which had been adjudged unlawful,
and as this could be effected by sale-and distribution in cash, or by distribution in kind, the company was justified in adopting the latter
method and avoiding the forced sale of several hundred million dollars
of stock which would have involved disastrous results.

Statement of the Case.

197 U. S.

Line Railroad Company and The Equitable Trust Company
of New York exhibited their bill against the Northern Securities Company in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of New Jersey, April 20, 1904, on which, with
accompanying affidavits and exhibits, a restraining order was
issued, pending an application for an injunction as prayed in
the bill. April 26 an amended bill was filed, and the application for a preliminary injunction was heard May 20, 21 and-23
by Bradford, J., holding the Circuit Court.
On the fourth day of June a second amended bill was filed,
and on July 15, 1904, Judge Bradford delivered an opinion
sustaining the application. 132 Fed. Rep. 464.
The order for injunction was entered August 18, 1904, and
an appeal therefrom was prosecuted to the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit, which, on January 3, 1905,
reversed the order. 134 Fed. Rep. 331.
Thereupon complainants applied to this court for the writ
of certiorari, which was granted January 30, and the matter
advanced for hearing, and heard March 1 and 2. The affirmance of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was announced March 6, it being added that an opinion would be
filed afterwards.
The Northern Pacific Railway Company was the successor
through reorganization of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Company, and by its charter it was provided that its capital stock
might be increased from time to time by a vote of a majority
of the stockholders, and that the company might, by a like
vote, classify its stock into common and preferred, and might
"make such preferred stock convertible into. common stock
upon such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board
of directors." On July 1, 1896, by the unanimous vote of its
then stockholders, the capital stock was increased to one
hundred and fifty-five million dollars, divided into eighty
millions of common stock and seventy-five millions of preferred stock, and it was resolved "that such preferred stock
shall be issued upon the condition that at its option the com-

Statement of the Case.

pany may retire the same, in whole or in part, at par, from
time to time, on any first day of January prior to 1917." The
plan of reorganization which was adopted provided that as
to the new company which it was contemplated should acquire
the properties and franchises of the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, and the issue of preferred stock by it, "the right
will be reserved by the new company to retire this stock, in
whole or in part, at par, from time to time, upon any first day
of January during the next twenty years."
All the certificates of stock, whether common or preferred,
at that time or subsequently issued, contained this -clause:
"The company shall have the right at its option, and in such
manner as it shall determine, to retire the preferred stock, in
whole or in part, at par, from time to time, upon any first day
of January prior to 1917."
The reorganization had been managed by J. P. Morgan &
Co., and the directory of the Northern Pacific Railway Company were friendly to that firm. During the same period the
president of tlie Great Northern Railway Company was James
J. Hill, and its directors were friendly to him.
The two companies were friendly to each other, and in April,
1901, acquired the shares of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railroad Company.
At this time the Union Pacific Railway system included the
Union Pacific Railway, the railroad of the Oregon Short Line
Railroad Company, and the railroad of the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation Company. The Union Pacific Company was
practically the owner of the entire capital stock of the Oregon
Short Line Railroad Company, and the latter company was
the owner of practically the entire capital stock of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company. The interests in control
of the Union Pacific system might properly be called the
Harriman interests. Shortly thereafter, at the instance of the
Union Pacific Railway Company and with money furnished
by that company, the Oregon Short Line Company purchased
Northern Pacific preferred stock to the amount of $41,085,00

and common stock to the amount of $37,023,000, aggregating
$78,100,000 of stock, being a majority of the $155,000,000,
total capital stock of the Northern Pacific Company as then
outstanding. But the preferred stock was subject to retirement at par at the option of the company, and the 370,230
shares of common stock was less than a majority of the total
common stock, which majority was held by the Morgan-Hill
party.
In October, 1901, complainant Harriman was elected a
member of the board of directors of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and James Stillman was reblected. They were
also directors of the Union Pacific Railway Company. They
both attended a meeting of the Northern Pacific board on
November 13, 1901, and Harriman was chosen a member of
the executive committee. At this meeting resolutions were
adopted providing for and resulting in the retirement of the
preferred stock on January 1, 1902, by-the payment of $100
cash for each and every share to each and every holder of
record on that day.
These resolutions declared that the company thereby determined to exercise its right to retire the preferred stock;
provided that for the purpose of raising the funds necessary
to do so, the company should issue its negotiable bonds for
$75,000,000, convertible at par into shares of the common
stock of the company at par; authorized the making of a contract for the sale of all of such bond,- at par and accrued interest, the contract to contain a provision giving to the holder
of every share of the common stock the opportunity to receive
from the contract purchaser, at par and interest, such bonds
to an amount equal to seventy-five eightieths of the par amount
of said common stock at such time owned by such holder, and
arranged for the retirement from and after December 31, 1901,
of the $75,000,000 preferred stock, by the payment to each
and every holder of record thereof on January 1, 1902, of $100
cash for each and every share.
On November 15, the executive committee of the Northern

Pacific Company authorized the execution of a contract with
the Standard Trust Company of New York for the sale and
delivery of the convertible certificates for $75,000,000 provided for in the resolutions.
The preferred stock was subsequently taken up in accordance with the plan resolved upon.
The Northern Securities Company was incorporated under
the laws of New Jersey in November, 1901, its articles of
association having been filed at Trenton on the thirteenth
day of that month, with a capital stock of $400,000,000,
divided into 4,000,000 shares of the par value of $100 each,
and its objects being certified to be:
"(1.) To acquire by purchase, subscription or otherwise,
and to hold as investments any bonds or other securities or
evidences of indebtedness, or any shares of capital stock
created or issued by any other corporation or corporations,
association or associations, of the State of New Jersey or of

all -the rights, powers and privileges of ownership, including
the right to vote thereon.

of which any bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or stock are held by the corporation; and to do any

hance the value of any such bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or stock.
"(5.) To acquire, own and hold such real and personal
property as may be necessary or convenient for the transaction of its business.
"The business or purpose of the corporation is from time

set forth.
"The corporation shall have power to conduct its business
in other States and in foreign countries, and to have one or
more offices out of this State, and to hold, purchase, mortgage
and convey real and personal property out of this State."
On the fourteenth day of November, 1901, fifteen gentlemen, including complainant Harriman and two other directors
of the Union Pacific, James J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern, and two members of J. P. Morgan & Co., were
elected directors of the Northern Securities Company. Complainant Harriman took his seat at the board and an executive
committee of five was elected, of which he was one.
November 15 resolutions were passed authorizing the purchase of the Northern Pacific stock held by Harriman and
Pierce, as follows:
"The president stated that he now had an opportunity of
acquiring $37,023,000 par value of the common stock, and
$41,085,000 par value of the preferred stock, of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, at an aggregate price of $91,407,500,

payable, as to $82,491,871, in the fully paid-up and nonassessable shares of this company at par, and, as to the remaining $8,915,629, in cash.
"On motion, and by affirmative vote of all the directors
present, it was"Resolved, That the president be, and hereby he is, authorized in behalf of this company, to purchase said stock-

namely $37,023,000 par value of the common stock, and
$41,085,000 par value of the preferred stock of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, at an aggregate price of $91,407,500,

payable as to $82,491,871 thereof in the fully paid-up and nonassessable shares of the capital stock of this company at par,
and as to $8,915,629 in cash; and that the officers of this company be, and hereby they are, authorized to issue fully paid-up
and non-assessable shares of stock of this company to the
amount of $82,491,871, and to pay $8,915,629 in cash, in
consideration of such $37,023,000 of the common stock and
$41,085,000 of the preferred stock of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company.
"Resolved, That the president be, and hereby he is, authorized at any time to retire at, par, for cash, any and all
preferred stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
that may be acquired by this company, and in case such
retirement shall be effected prior to January 1, 1902, to allow
interest up to January 1, 1902, at the rate of four per
cent per annum, on the sum receivable for such preferred
stock.
"Resolved, That the president be, and hereby he is, authorized in behalf of this company to purchase at their par
value an amount of the convertible certificates of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, to be issued pursuant to the
resolutions of the board of directors of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company, passed November 13, 1901, equal to
seventy-five eightieths of the par amount of any and all
common stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
that shall have been acquired by this company.
"Resolved, That the president be, and hereby he is, authorized, in case of the purchase by this company of any of
the convertible certificates of the Northern Pacific Railway
Company, to convert the same into common stock of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company whenever such conversion may be effected.
"Resolved, That the president be, and hereby he is, authorized to borrow, on such terms as he may arrange, any
moneys required for the purpose of carrying out the foregoing resolutions, and to make all financial arrangements,

and to do all acts and things, which he may deem needful in
the premises."
Complainant Harriman and his co-directors of the Union
Pacific were not present at this meeting, but were present at
the next meeting of the board on November 19, at which the
minutes of the meeting of November 15 were read and on
motion were approved.
At a subsequent meeting of the executive committee, in
which Mr. Harriman participated, the form of the company's
permanent stock certificate, being the usual form, was unanimously approved.
In the meantime, and on November 18, Harriman and
Pierce had delivered their Northern Pacific stock ,to the Northern Securities Company and that company had delivered to
them the 824,000 shares of its stock and $8,915,629 in cash.
The Northern Pacific stock certificates received from Harriman and Pierce were surrendered by the Securities Company
to the Northern Pacific Railway Company. The certificates
for the 370,230 shares of common stock were exchanged for
370,230 shares of common stock issued in the name of the
Northern Securities Company. The certificates for the 410,580
shares of preferred stock were surrendered to the Northern
Pacific Railway Company for retirement, and paid for and
retired as provided, the transaction resulting in the receipt
by the Northern Securities Company of certificates for 347,090
shares of new common stock. This made 717,320 shares, and
the Securities Company also acquired 820,270 shares, from a
large number of separate individual owners. And from a large
number of stockholders of the Great Northern 1,181,242 shares
of the stock of the latter company.
At a meeting of the board of directors of the Northern
Securities Company on January 22, 1903, at which complainant Harriman was present, the sale by the company of 75,000
shares of its own stock for cash was approved. The second
amended bill says $7,522,000 "was issued for cash used for
the purchase of other property and for corporate purposes."

Statement of the Case.

From the organization of the Securities Company until the
affirmance of the decree in the Government suit, hereafter
mentioned, complainants continued to exercise the right of
holders of 824,000 shares of stock in the Securities Company;
received their share of dividends, and gave their proxy to vote
at the annual meetings of 1902 and 1903.
July 17, 1902, Harriman and Pierce and the Oregon Short
Line Company pledged the 824,000 shares of Northern Securities Company stock to the Equitable Trust Company, the
Short Line Company executing a trust indenture, which contained this clause: "The deposit and pledge hereunder of said
shares of stock, or of any other securities which shall become
subject to this indenture, shall not prevent the consolidation,
union or merger with any other corporation of the Securities
Company, or of any other corporation by which said securities
shall have been issued, or the sale of its property or the distribution of its assets. In any such case the trustee shall receive
such amounts of stock, bonds or other securities, or money,
or of either or all of them, as the holders of the pledged shares
of stock of the Securities Company or other pledged securities,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive and upon receipt
thereof shall surrender the deposited stock certificates or
other securities."
March 10,, 1902, a bill was exhibited in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the District of Minnesota by the United
States against the Northern Securities Company, the Northern Pacific Railway Company, the Great Northern Railway
Company, James J. Hill, William P. Clough, D. Willis James,
John S. Kennedy, J. Pierpont Morgan, Robert Bacon, George
F. Baker and Daniel S. Lamont, to restrain the violation of
the act of Congress of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, c. 647, entitled "An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies," which resulted April 9, 1903,
in a decision in favor of complainants, 120 Fed. Rep. 721,

Pacific Railway Company and all the stock of the Great
Northern Railway Company, now claimed to be held and
owned by the defendant, the Northern Securities Company,
was acquired and is now held by it in virtue of such combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among
the several States; that the Northern Securities Company, its
officers, agents, servants, and employds, be, and they are
hereby, enjoined from acquiring or attempting to acquire
further stock of either of the aforesaid railway companies;
that the Northern Securities Company be enjoined from voting
the aforesaid stock which it now holds or may acquire, and
from attempting to vote it, at any meeting of the stockholders
of either of the aforesaid railway companies, and from exercising or attempting to exercise any control, direction, supervision, or influence whatsoever over the acts and doings of
said railway companies, or either of them, by virtue of its
holding such stock therein; that the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company,
their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be, and they
are hereby, respectively and collectively enjoined from permitting the stock aforesaid to be voted by the Northern
Securities Company, or in its behalf, by its attorneys or agents,
at any corporate election for directors or officers of either of
the aforesaid railway companies, and that they, together with
their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be likewise enjoined and respectively restrained from paying any dividends
to the Northern Securities Company on account of stock in
either of the aforesaid railway companies which it now claims
to own and hold; and that the aforesaid railway companies,
their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be enjoined from
permitting or suffering the Northern Securities Company, or

any of its officers or agents, as such officers or agents, to
exercise any control whatsoever over the corporate acts of
either of the aforesaid railway companies.
"But nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securities Company from returning and
transferring to the stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company,
respectively, any and all shares of stock in either of said railway companies which the said Northern Securities Company
may have heretofore received from such stockholders in exchange for its own stock; and nothing herein contained shall
be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securities Company
from making such transfer and assignments of the stock aforesaid to such person or persons as may now be the holders and
owners of its own stock originally issued in exchange or in
payment for the stock claimed to have been acquired by it in
the aforesaid railway companies."'
The case was brought to this court, and March 14, 1904,
the decree was affirmed. 193 U. S. 197.
March 22, 1904, the board of directors of the Northern
Securities Company adopted the following preamble and resolutions:
"Whereas, In the course of its business, this company has
acquired, and now holds 1,537,594 shares in the capital stock
of the Northern Pacific Railway Company; and 1,181,242

"Whereas, In a suit brought by the United States against

"Resolved, In consideration of the premises, it is declared
necessary and desirable for this company so to reduce its
present stock as will enable it, without delay, in connection
with such reduction, to distribute among its shareholders, the
shares of capital stock of said railroad companies held by it.
"Resolved, That the board of directors of this company
hereby declares it advisable that article (Fourth) of this company's certificate of incorporation be amended, so as to read
as follows:
"Fourth. The capital stock of this company is hereby reduced to three million nine hundred and fifty-four thousand
dollars ($3,954,000), and shall hereafter be three million nine

into thirty-nine thousand five hundred forty (39,540) shares
of one hundred dollars ($100) each. Such reduction of capital
stock shall be accomplished by each holder of outstanding
shares of this company's stock surrendering to the company,
for retirement, ninety-nine (99) per centum of the shares held

"Upon the surrender to this company, by any shareholder,
of the entire number of shares, and parts of shares, of this
company's stock, which he is hereby required to surrender,
this company will assign to him, for each share so surrendered,
thirty-nine dollars and twenty-seven cents ($39.27) of the

of the stock of this company, or to the assignment and transfer
of the stocks of the said railway companies, hereby contemplated, shall be under the direction of the board. For the
purposes hereof, the stockholders of this company, and the
number of shares held by them, respectively, shall be determined from the stock transfer books of the company, which,
for such determination, shall be closed at a day and hour to
be determined by resolution of the board.
"Resolved, That a meeting. of the stockholders of this company, for the purpose of taking action upon the said alteration
of the certificate of incorporation of this company and also
upon such other business as may come before the meeting, be,

company in the city of Hoboken, county of Hudson, and
State of New Jersey, at 11 o'clock A. m., on April 21, A. D.
1904."
Notice was accordingly given that the meeting of the stockholders would be held on April 21, and a copy of the resolutions and an explanatory letter were sent to the Attorney
General of the United States. Early in April the three principal complainants in the present suit presented to the Circuit
Court for the District of Minnesota their petition for leave to
intervene in the suit of the United States against the Northern
Securities Company, setting up substantially the same grounds
as in this suit, and seeking similar relief. This application was
heard at St. Paul, April 12 and 13. The Government appeared
by the Attorney General, and filed a declaration that it was
satisfied with the relief granted. April 19, 1904, the court
,rendered its decision, denying leave to intervene. 128 Fed.
Rep. 808.
Up to April 18, 1904, the Securities Company had issued
86,945 certificates of stock and there had been 16,000 transfers
registered on the books of the company. At the closing of
the transfer books on that day there were 3,953,971 shares
of stock outstanding in the hands of 2,531 separate holders.

Statement of the Case.

197 U. S.

The meeting of the stockholders of the Northern Securities
Company was duly held April 21, 1904; and at that meeting
the stock of the company was reduced ninety-nine per centuni,
and the proposed pro rata distribution of the stock of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company and of the preferred stock
of the Great Northern Railway Company, to and amongst the
shareholders of the Northern Securities Company, was assented
to. Two million nine hundred and forty-four thousand seven
hundred and forty shares were represented and all voted for
the plan adopted by the directors.
As has been stated, the second amended bill was filed after
the hearing on the application for the preliminary injunction,
and it was therein alleged, among other things, that the
Northern Securities Company was incorporated and organized
in pursuance of a combination in restraint of trade and commerce among the several States; that the said company was
to "acquire and permanently hold a majority of the shares of
the capital stock of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Companies and control the operation and management thereof
in perpetuity, and that the then existing holders of such
railway shares shoufd deposit the same with said holding
company and receive in lieu thereof share certificates of said
holding company upon the basis of $180 par value of its stock
for each share of Great Northern stock and $115 par value of
its stock for each share of Northern Pacific stock, and that
said holding company should act as custodian, depositary, or
trustee of said railway shares on behalf of the existing stockholders of said railway companies and their assigns."
"That prior to the incorporation of said Northern Securities

the name of your orators Harriman and Pierce; and that after

Statement of the Case.

the incorporation of the said Northern Securities Company
had been resolved upon as aforesaid, your orators Harriman,
Pierce and Oregon Short Line Railroad Company agreed with
the promoters and incorporators of said Northern Securities
Company to transfer to and deposit with said Northern Securities Company, under the terms and conditions aforesaid, the
said shares of said Northern Pacific Railway Company of the
aggregate par value of $78,108,000 owned by said Oregon
Short Line Railroad Company as aforesaid, and to receive in
exchange therefor certificates of said Northern Securities Company representing an interest therein of $82,491,871 par value
and $8,915,629 in cash, and in pursuance of said agreement
your orators Harriman and Pierce, acting for your orator
Oregon Short Line Railroad Company, did, on or about the
eighteenth day of November, 1901, transfer and deliver to said
Northern Securities Company certificates for $37,023,000 par
value of the common stock and $41,085,000 par value of the
preferred stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company
owned by your said orator as aforesaid and received in exchange therefor certificates of said Northern Securities Company representing an interest in $82,491,871 par value and
said cash. . .
"That at the time of such exchange, on said eighteenth of
November, 1901, it was agreed between said Harriman and
Pierce and said defendant Northern Securities Company that
the said $41,085,000 par value of said preferred stock of the
said Northern Pacific Railway Company should be converted
into common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company; that said preferred stock was subsequently and in or
about the month of December, 1901, converted by said defendant Northern Securities Company into common stock of
said Northern Pacific Railway Company of the same par value;
that certificates for $34,709,062 par value of such common
stock registered in its name on the books of said railway company were substituted in lieu and place of the certificates for
said preferred stock; that said Northern Securities Company

caused said original common stock to be transferred into its
name upon the books of said railway company, and that said
Northern Securities Company now holds within the jurisdiction of this court certificates registered in its name on the
books of the Northern Pacific Company for said common stock
so originally received from your orators Harriman and Pierce
and for said common stock into which said preferred stock
was so converted and certificates substituted as aforesaid."
"Your orators are advised by counsel and, therefore, aver
that the effect of said decree of April 9, 1903, as affirmed by
the Supreme Court of the United States, was to adjudge that
the Northern Securities Company was not a purchaser or
owner but simply a custodian of the shares of stock of said
railway company acquired and held by it as aforesaid, that it
acquired and held possession thereof in violation of said antitrust act, that it acquired no title thereto and cannot transfer
any rights in respect thereof, and that the legal and equitable
owners of said shares of the stock of said railway companies
were and are the several parties who originally exchanged the
same for stock of the Northern Securities Company or their
assigns."
The prayer of the bill was "that it be decreed that said proposed plan of distribution is illegal and contrary to law and in
violation of the rights and equities of your orators, and that
the complainants are entitled to the return and transfer to
them by the defendant Northern Securities Company of the
shares of common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway
Company which were, so delivered by said Harriman and
Pierce and the shares of common stock into which the preferred
stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company delivered by
them were converted, in exchange for the certificates of stock
of the Northern Securities Company so issued to and now held
by your orators and such sum in cash as may be just; and that
the said defendant, Northern Securities Company, its directors,
officers and agents, may be ordered and directed to endorse

the certificates now held by it for said stock of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company to your said orator Oregon Short
Line Railroad Company or in blank, and deliver the same to
your orator The Equitable Trust Company of New York in
exchange for the stock of the Northern Securities Company
now held by it to be held subject to its rights and lien as
trustee aforesaid; and that the defendant Northern Securities
Company, its directors, officers, agents and employ6s be perpetually enjoined and restrained from in any manner parting
with, disposing of, transferring, assigning or distributing any
part of said stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
so received from your. orators Harriman and Pierce as aforesaid, or any common stock into which the preferred stock
received from them may have been converted, or the certificates now representing the same or any part thereof, except
to return the same to your orators in exchange for its own
stock so issued as aforesaid and said cash; and that your
orators have such other or further or general relief against said
Northern Securities Company as shall be proper and just under
the circumstances of the case.
"Your orators further pray that the defendant Northern
Securities Company may be enjoined and restrained from
parting with, disposing of, transferring, assigning or distributing said stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company or
any part thereof during the pendency of this suit or any
certificates now representing the same."

of United States v. Northern Securities Company; the ex parte
affidavits of Harriman, Hill, and others; the deposition of
Harriman taken before the Interstate Commerce Commission
at Chicago in January, 1902; the deposition of Harriman taken

As to the power of the court to enter final judgment; this
case does not fall under Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, 165
U. S. 518, but under the exceptions in Mast, Foos Co. v. Stover
Mfg. Co., 177 U. S. 485, 494, and see Brill v. Peckham Motor
Truck Co., 189 U. S. 57, 63.
The Northern Securities Company, having been organized
for an illegal purpose and having obtained possession of the
railway stocks in pursuance of such purpose, could not thereby
cquire the title to and ownership of the stocks.
The whole transaction was illegal, ultra vires and void from
the beginning to the end. It was, legally speaking, a nullity
-"an aggregate of nothings." Scovill v. Thayer, 105 U. S.

R. R. Co., 118 U. S. 290.
The contract is void; the objection is not only that the corporation ought not to have made it, but that it could not make
it, that the contract cannot be ratified or confirmed by the
stockholders, because it could not have been authorized by
them, and that no performance can give the unlawful agreement any validity by way of estoppel or otherwise, or be the
foundation of any right. Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman's

adjudicata or as a judicial precedent, must be ascertained, not
merely from the decree or mandate, but also from the pleadings and the opinions delivered by the court. It is likewise
proper to refer to the evidence before the court and to the
arguments of counsel whenever necessary in order to determine exactly what points the court has ruled upon. The
court is always at liberty to refer to its own records. Dimmick v. Tompkins, 194 U. S. 540, 548; Bienville Water Supply
Co. v. Mobile, 186 U. S. 212, 217; Butler v. Eaton, 141 U. S.
240. Every question directly presented by the issues and
discussed and passed upon in the opinions is as much a part
of the decision and judgment of the court as if it had been
expressly recited in its decree or mandate. So, the mandate
of this court is always to be read in the light of its opinion,
and it has never been the practice to recite in the mandate any
of the points decided, but simply to declare the ultimate conclusion of affirmance, reversal, dismissal or qualification of the
decree below. Last Chance Min. Co. v. Tyler Min.Co., 157

As stockholders, the complainants were clearly not strangers
to a litigation which involved the right of the corporation to
carry out the objects for which it was organized and which
affected the titlo to all its property, received from them. As
depositors, they were represented by their custodian, agent
or trustee as to its right to hold and the legality of its custodianship. All identified in interest and in privity with one of the
litigating parties are concluded by a judgment and entitled
to invoke its effect. New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, 167 U. S.
371, 396. Even if the decision in the Government suit does
not constitute res adjudicata in the strict technical sense, it
undoubtedly should have been regarded as a controlling judi-

Culver, 22 Kansas, 661, 668; Pugh v. Davis, 96 U. S. 332, 336.
The bill and proofs in the Government .suit were all to
effect that the Northern Securities Company was organized
to effectuate an illegal holding corporation.
In the case of an illegal trust and combination entered into
and adjudged to be in violation of an act of Congress, particularly where, at the very inception of any such scheme, its
legality is at once publicly challenged by the National Government, justice and sound public policy will be promoted by
decreeing the restoration of the status quo, and not permitting
distribution on the basis of alleged rights acquired under and
by virtue of the illegal contract and in disregard and defiance
of the pending litigation.
If Mr. Hill and his associates are to be judged as-other men
are judged and are to be presumed to have contemplated and
intended the consequences of their own acts, there can be no
escape for them from the conclusion that the present proposed
plan of distribution is a willful and deliberate attempt to
circumvent the decree in the Government suit, and was, in
fact, all along, the alternative intended as part of their original
unlawful scheme.
The Circuit Court in Minnesota did not intend to pass upon
or to prejudice or prejudge the merits of a controversy which
it declined to consider or decide.
There has been no equitable estoppel created for the benefit
of the Northern Securities Company by what the company
did or continued to do during the pendency of the Government suit and in defiance of the serious claim therein made,
either as to sale of stock, all of the purchasers having notice
of the situation, or by the receipt of dividends on the Northern
Securities, stock by the complainants. L. & N. Railroad Co.

them. If so, a statute could be abrogated by simply contracting to do the prohibited act. Cases supra and Thomas v.
Railroad Co., 101 U. S. 71, 86; Veeder v. Mudgett, 95 N. Y.
295, 310.

The Northern Securities Company claims that because it
now holds possession by virtue of an illegal contract between
parties in par; delicto, the complainants and all other depositors
can be allowed no standing in any court of law or equity to
reclaim their property. This contention cannot be sustained.
Its result obviously would be that the company might dispose of and distribute at will all the property it held without
legal -accountability to any one. Yarmouth v. France, 19
Q. B. D. 647, 653; Northrup v. Graves, 19 Connecticut, 548,
554; 2 Stephen Cr. Law, 4; McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U. S.
639; 669. Complainants acted in good faith and belief that
the Northern Securities Company was not an illegal combination. As to what Congress itself contemplated by the statute is uncertain. See Cong. Rec., 51st Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 21,
Pt. 3, pp. 2460, 3146, 4089.
Where the illegal purpose cannot be continued and must
necessarily be abandoned, the innocent owner of property
transferred does not forfeit his legal rights so that he has become outlawed, and cannot-maintain an action to recover his
property, and the other party may retain the property free
from accountability and convert it to his own use or dispose
of it as he sees fit, and the one in possession is protected in
appropriating the property by a maxim of equity. Nat. Bank
& Loan Co. v. Petrie, 189 U. S. 423.
The rule as to parties in par; delicto contemplates the existence of a delictum, that is, a wrongful act knowingly done, an
intentional "transgression against positive law." Parties are
not in par delicto when there is concededly no intentional
wrongdoing or crime. Even in criminal cases, satisfactory
proof of a mistake of the law, honestly -held in consequence
of a reasonable, but erroneous, construction of a doubtful
statute, .often operates to prevent a conviction. Queen v.

When an illegal contract is sought to be specifically enforced or when damages are claimed for its breach, undoubtedly the sound rule is that the difference between malum
prohibitum and malum in se is immaterial. Gibbs v. Baltimore
Gas Co., 130 U. S. 396, 412.
But the distinction between malum prohibitum and malum
in se has been often recognized by the courts when considering
the right to recover property transferred under an illegal contract, upon disaffirmance or termination of the illegal transaction, under circumstances which result in a failure of consideration. Where the transaction involves moral turpitude,
such as the giving of a bribe, or facilitating the commission
of an immoral act or a heinous crime, the party is so clearly
culpable arid deserving of punishment that the courts will
refuse to-lend him any assistance against another party to the
immoral transaction, but will leave both parties where their
own immoral conduct has placed them. Where, however,
the act involves no moral turpitude, but is merely malum
prohibitum as distinguished from malum in se, relief has often
been granted by restoring the status quo so far as practicable.
Pratt v. Short, 79 N. Y. 437, 445. For distinction betveen
malum prohibitum and malum in se see Stock Yards v. Railroad Co., 196 U. S. 217; Spring Co. v. Knowlton, 103 U. S. 49;

v. Brown, 106 U. S. 487; Bank v. Townsend, 139 U. S. 67, 75.
In this case the transaction was not, malum in se. All the
parties believed they were not violating the law. The transaction was not forbjdden by the common law. In re Greene,

Where money or property has been deposited with a trustee

sustained. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S.
197, 357.
A universally recognized exception to the rule concerning
parties in pari delicto is that the courts will permit the recovery
of property delivered and held under an illegal contract which
has been terminated in fieri, when the public interests will
be advanced thereby. Starke's Exrs. v. Littlepage, 4 Rand.

Eq. Jur. § 298.
These complainants can follow the common Northern Pacific stock obtained by the Northern Securities Company by
the conversion of the preferred stock. Where specific property
belonging to another is changed by a custodian, bailee, trustee
or agent into other property or funds, the original owner is
entitled to follow it as long as it can be ascertained to be such,
and the right only ceases when the means of ascertainment
fail. National Bank v. Insurance Co., 104 U. S.54, 68. See
also Silsbury v. McCoon, 3 N. Y. 379, 390; McLarren v. Brewer,
51 Maine, 402, 404.
The real nature of the transaction was not changed by the
conversion of stock. It was not an independent subscription
for bonds.
The issue of the convertible certificates, the retirement of
the preferred stock, and the conversion of the convertible
certificates into common stock, are shown to have taken
place all on the same day as part of one transaction and the
securities are traceable. This was the only way it could be
done under the laws of Wisconsin'and the corporate powers of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company. Weidenfeld v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 129 Fed. Rep. 305; Laws Wisconsin, 1895,

Securities Company upon the motives of the complainants in
instituting this suit and the announcement that if complainants prevailed and recovered their property, the so-called
Union Pacific Railroad System would secure control of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company nor should this consideration influence the court, change the rules of law, and produce
a different result than if this feature did not exist.
This court will not consider the motives of parties in instituting legal proceedings to protect their alleged legal or
equitable rights. Dickerman v. Trust Co., 176 U. S. 181, 190;
South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286, 311. There is
an uncontradicted statement in the record that the roads are
not parallel and competitive. And see also Louisville and
Nashville v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 698. The real competitive lines are the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific
and it has been the motive of those in control of the Great
Northern to stifle competition.
If the railway shares deposited are not to be returned but

Complainants in this case are entitled to set up and plead
as res adjudicata the findings, conclusions and decree of this
court in the Government case as hereinbefore enumerated,
even if the cause of action in the Government case was different from the cause of action in the present case.
The decision in the Government case caused the present
litigation. This case is the child of that parent. The parties
to the present case, the appellants and the Northern Securities
Company, were parties to the Government case, and in the
same capacity.
The subject matter of the present litigatin is 717,320 shares
of the capital stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and this identical capital stock was the stock which the
complainants assigned' to the Northern Securities Company
for the purpose of carrying out the combination.
The averments of the bill and answers in the Government
case distinctly raised, inter alia, as material numerous questions upon which the controversy turned, questions which

OCTOBER TERM. 1904.
Argument for Petitioners.

197 U. S.

are in substance, the same as are now restated in somewhat
different form.
These stocks in the two railroad companies which, as averred
in the bill in the Government case, and as found by this court,
were transferred by Hill, Morgan and other stockholders to
the Securities Company in pursuance of, and to perfect the
illegal combination to restrain trade and commerce, included
the stock owned by the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company
and held in the name of Harriman and Pierce as trustees, being
the identical stock in controversy in this case.
This court had before it in the Government case all the
testimony which was before the Court of Appeals in the present
case as to the manner in which, and the purpose for which,
the Securities Company acquired the Oregon Short Line stock
in the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and this included
the evidence of Mr: Harriman.
Not only did the pleadings sharply raise the issues in the
Government case which are also in this case,-and this court
discussed these issues and decided them,-but the evidence
in the Government case, including all of Mr. Harriman's,
supported the conclusions of this court on those issues.
The so-called permissive portion of the decree certainly did
authorize the return by the Securities Company to the individual stockholders who assigned to the Securities Company
the identical stock so assigned. If it was Northern Pacific
stock, then Northern Pacific stock was to be returned.
The St. Paul opinion of Judge Thayer misconstrued the
St. Louis decree as the St. Louis court did not make, as the
controlling question in the case, the distinction between the
real, substantial ownership and the mere holding of the railroad stocks as custodian that this court did.
The Court of Appeals erred in deciding that this court did
not even "incidentally" consider the question of ownership
and deciding this case as if the Government case had not arisen.
The equities of the case are with comp!ainants.
All parties fully believed this plan to be lawful and really

beneficial to commerce, but this court adjudged it was aviolation of the Sherman Act, and made a decree which restrained the Securities Company from carrying out the scheme
and rendered the railway stock worthless in its possession,
This necessitated a dissolution of the Securities Company, asthe Supreme Court foresaw.
Evidently, the scheme having failed, this put every one in
statu quo, ante as to the transfer to the Securities Company
of their respective stocks-and this could only be. done by
retransferring to each his stock, the Securities Company still
holds it-each still holds his Securities Company stock. The
retransfer is simple. If there be strangers who came in
afterwards and who have equities, do what is fair to
them.
Whoever bought stock after March 10, 1902, had notice
pendente lite and is concluded by the decree. Tilton v. Cofield,
93 U. S. 163. Hill, Morgan and Company are taking the
property and seeking shelter behind either one of two innocent
holders. They control the Securities Company and therefore
owe complainants good faith but having induced complainants
to put their stock into the Securities Company now they intend to avail of the situation to make money and secure control of the railway companies for- themselves.
The Securities Company cannot compel complainants to
accept Great Northern stock in lieu of their Northern Pacific.
The stockholders of a corporation upon dissolution cannot be
compelled to accept a distribution of their share of the assets.

from an interlocutory decree, enter a final one, see Forsythe

U. S.524; Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., 177 U. S.494;
Britt v. Peckham Motor Co., 189 U. S.58, from which it appears
that the present case is not one where the Circuit Court of
Appeals on an appeal from an.interlocutory order granting a

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

197 U. S.

preliminary injunction, could enter what is practically a final
decree, and finally dispose of the case on the merits.
The necessity for a hearing in the ordinary way where each
side could put in all its proofs, cross-examine witnesses, compel
the attendance of hostile witnesses and the production of all
books and papers, is not only apparent from the complications
in this case, but is further shown by the inaccuracy which the
Circuit Court of Appeals fell into in finally considering and
passing on the case merely on an interlocutory hearing and
upon ex parte affidavits.
Mr. Elihu Root, with whom Mr. Francis Lynde Stetson was
on the brief, for respondent:
Everything in the record, by mere recital and without argument, shows that in fact and by intent of both parties, there
was a sale of the Northern Pacific stock to the Securities
Company in consideration of a stockholder's interest in that
company, and a large sum of money-i. e., the issue to Harriman and Pierce of 824,918 shares of the stock and the payment
to them of $8,915,629 in cash.
The complainants are estopped from asserting that the
Securities Company is a trustee or bailee. They have publicly
held out the Securities Company to be the owner of the railway stocks, and have induced innocent third persons to acquire interests in the corporation in reliance thereupon.
But whether the Securities Company be a vendee or a
custodian, the complainants are not entitled to recover the
Northern Pacific stock. The transaction was in contravention
of public policy and a penal statute,. and their demand for the
return of the stock by them delivered for such illegal purpose,
is barred by the rule In pari delicto potior est conditio delendentis et possidentis. The complainants cannot avoid the bar
of the rule, if the Securities Company be regarded as vendee.
The complainants and the Securities Company are in paridelicto.
Neither can the complainants avoid the operation of the
rule by treating the Securities Company merely as custodian,

HARRIMAN v-. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.

Argument for Respondent.

to hold a deposited stock, to collect dividends, etc. The
Securities Company is in pari delicto with the complainants.
-t was an active party to the illegality.
The complainants assisted in placing the control of the
ailway companies in the hands of the Securities Company,
mad in maintaining that status until the decree in the Governnent suit was affirmed by the Supreme Court. This executed
:he illegal purpose to such a degree as to bar the assertion of
ny right to withdraw the property deposited.
Property delivered under an illegal contract cannot be re!overed back by any party in pari delicto; certainly not in any
fase where the contract has been executed in whole or in part.

Mr. John G. Johnson, with whom Mr. John W. Griggs and
Mr. W. P. Clough were on the brief, also for respondent:
On appeal from an interlocutory decree granting a special
injunction in a suit for establishing title to property, if the
record fully and fairly discloses the case on the point of title,
the Appellate Court not only may, but rightfully should, determine the question of the injunction upon the merits of
plaintiff's claim. The action of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in this case was controlled by that rule, and proceeded upon
it. 1 High on Injunction, 3d ed. § 7; Knoxville v. Africa, 47
U. S. App. 74; Bissell Co. v. Goshen Co., 43 C. C. A. 47; Shinkle
v. Louisville & Nashville, 62 Fed. Rep. 690; Mast, Foos & Co.
v. Stover Mfg. Co., 177 U. S. 485.
If, up to the time of argument of the appeal in the Circuit
Court of Appeals, plaintiffs had been entitled to a stay of
the pro rata plan of distribution, until opportunity could be
given for fair argument and advisement upon the law
points involved in their claim, such right was exhausted
by their opportunity to be heard in the Circuit Court of
Appeals.
. In the Circuit Court of Appeals, therefore, the whole
case
for an injunction, pendente lite, was thrown back upon the first
ground of the Circuit Court, viz., "grave and difficult" questions of fact, for ultimate determination.
The bill claims two distinct parcels of stock, one of which
complainants never owned.
Plaintiffs' claims are self-contradictory and can be established, if at all, only under rules of common law. Equity rules
cannot be invoked in their support.
The facts constituting title to the stock in controversy necessarily consist of, and are limited to, the things said and done,
vnd mutually intended, by Harriman and Pierce on the one
part, and the Securities Company on the other. As all material facts in regard to those sayings, doings and mutual intentions appear in this record, the entire case, on both sides,
relating to title, must be here and can be disposed of.

Argument for Respondent.

The Union Pacific owns the Oregon Short Line. The latter
owns the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company.
As to effect of acquisition of control of the stock of a competing road made by a railway company, and by the stockholders of a railway company see the Pearsall case, 161 U.
S. 646; Kentucky v. Louisville & Nashville, 161 U. S. 676.
Plaintiffs in effect ask the court to place control of the
Northern Pacific system of railways in the hands of the Union
Pacific Railroad Company. Of the relative geographical positions of the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific Railway
systems, and of the public laws of the several States on the
subject of railway combinations, as well as of the Federal laws
on the same subject, the court will take notice without proofs.
The burden of proof is on plaintiffs to show, by proper evidence, that the sale to Securities Company was different from
what, on its face, it appears to have been. No such proof was
tendered.
Plaintiffs really found their claims on what they assert to
have been adjudicated in the Government suit, and not on
what was actually done and intended by the parties. The
plaintiffs were strangers to that suit.
For the assumed adjudication in their favor, plaintiffs rely
not on the decree, but upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan
which does not, however, mean what plaintiffs claim, and
their alternate theory, that the title of Securities Company
was subject to a condition, since broken, is unsupported by
fact, law or adjudication.
Where there has been a transfer of property, illegal from
any cause, and possession has been delivered to the person to
whom the title under the transfer was intended ultimately
to go, the transaction has become executed on the part of the
transferrer, and he cannot thereafter repudiate it and reclaim
the property because of the illegality.
This rule governs under all forms of illegality; whether in
doing something which the laws positively prohibit, or something which they merely omit to allow. Thomas v. Railroad

When complainants had transferred the Northern Pacific
shares to the Securities Company, and the latter had made
payment of the price therefor by handing over to them the
cash and the certificates for its own stock, coming to them,
nothing remained executory between the parties save the
implied mutual obligations concerning the Northern Securities
stock resulting from the relation of corporation and stockholder, thus created.
Mr. Thomas Thacher also submitted a brief for respondent:
The injunction pendente lite can be justified only upon the
theory that it is a necessary incident to the granting of such
final relief as the complainants appear to be entitled to. The
right to such final relief must appear; if not, the injunction
was error. If such right did not appear, the question of
granting or denying the injunction was not addressed to the
discretion of the court. If, upon the record, it does not appear
that the complainants are entitled to recover this stock the
order appealed from was erroneous and should be reversed.

If the argument of the complainants, therefore, still rests
upon the theory of res adjudicata, that is upon the effect of the
decrees in the Government suit, or upon any other theory
concerning which the facts are substantially undisputed, this
court, finding such theory unsound, will not simply reverse
the injunction order, but dismiss the bill.
It was not the legal effect of the decree in the-Government
suit that title to the stocks of the Northern Pacific Railway
Company and the Great Northern Railway Company, which
the Securities Company now holds, never passed to the lastnamed company. See opinions 193 U. S. 197, 321, 324, 327,

It does not follow as matter of law, from the facts shown
by the record, including the decree, that title to these stocks
did not pass to the Securities Company. The transaction

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER,

In applying to this court for the writ of certiorari counsel
for complainants insisted that the Circuit Court of Appeals
had practically disposed of the entire controversy on the

HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.
197 U. S.

287

Opinion of the Court.

merits, although its decree only reversed the order of the
Circuit Court granting the preliminary injunction. We accepted that view and granted the writ, in the circumstances,
notwithstanding the decree was not final. In our opinion
the record presented the whole case to that court, in such
wise, that it might properly have been finally disposed of in
terms by its decree, in accordance with the well settled rule
upon that subject. Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Manufacturing
Co., 177 U. S. 485, 495; Castner v. Coffman, 178 U. S. 168, 183;
Mayor &c. of Knoxville v. Africa, 77 Fed. Rep. 501.
In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company et al., 195 U. S. 540, 547, the Circuit Court had
granted a preliminary injunction, 120 Fed. Rep. 981, which
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 123 Fed. Rep.
33. The telegraph company moved that the decree be modified so as to direct the dismissal of the bill. The motion was
denied, and the telegraph company took an appeal to this
court. Subsequently the Circuit Court sua sponte entered an
order dismissing the bill, and the telegraph company appealed therefrom to the Circuit Court of Appeals. 195 U. S.
547. We then granted a certiorari, and, considering both
appeals together, affirmed the decree of dismissal.
In the present case we granted the certiorari, at the instance
of complainants, before the case had gone back to the Circuit
Court, and shall do what the Circuit Court of Appeals might
have done, that is, finally dispose of the case by our direction
to the Circuit Court.
Complainants deny that the Securities Company became
the owner of the Northern Pacific Railway shares, and assert
to the contrary that the company held the shares as a trustee
or a bailee for complainants.
And the principal ground on which this contention is rested
is that it was so adjudicated by the Circuit Court for the District of Minnesota in the Government suit, by the decree of
April 9, 1903, affirmed by this court.
It may be said in passing that complainants were not parties

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

197 U. S.

of record to that suit, and that they were not parties by representation, if the effect of the transfers as between the parties
thereto had been in issue and the vital conflict between complainants and the corporation, now set up, then existed, which
would destroy the community of interest on which the rule
of representation is founded. And, on the other hand, in that
suit the Northern Securities Company, at a time when complainant Harriman was a director, answered that: "Every
share of the Great Northern Company and the Northern Pacific Company acquired by this defendant has been, and, so
long as it remains the property of the defendant, will continue
to be, held and owned by it in its own right, and not under any
agreement, promise, or understanding on its part, or on the
part of its stockholders and officers, that the same shall be
held, owned, or kept by it for any period of 'time whatever, or
under any agreement that in any manner restricts or controls
to any extent any use of the same which might lawfully be
exercised by any other owner of said stocks."
But we are of opinion that the Circuit Court did not determine the quality of the transfer as between the defendants
themselves, nor was that the purpose of the Government
proceedings.
The decree of April 9, 1903, adjudged that defendants had
theretofore entered into a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce; that all stock of either of the
railway companies then held or owned by the Securities Company was acquired and held in virtue of such combination;
and enjoined the Securities Company and the two railway
companies from receiving, or permitting the exercise of, any
control by the Securities Company over either railway, or
any exercise of the voting power of the railway shares, and the
payment or reception of dividends upon the railway shares
held by the Securities Company; and the Securities Company
was forbidden from acquiring further stock of either of the
railway companies.
And it was provided that nothing should be construed as

HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.

289

Opinion of the Court.

prohibiting the Securities Company from returning and transferring the railway shares to the original railway stockholders
who had delivered their shares to the Securities Company for
shares of its stock; or to such person or persons as might be
the holders and owners of its own stock originally issued in
exchange or in payment for the stock claimed to have been
acquired by it in the railway companies.
This did not involve a decision that any original vendor of
the railway shares was entitled to a judicial restitution thereof,
and such was the view of the Circuit Court itself, for in its
opinion of April 19, 1904, the court said:
"The decree was wholly prohibitory. It enjoined the doing
of certain threatened acts, and so long as these acts are not
done it enforces itself, and no further action looking to its
enforcement is deemed essential.
"In its bill of complaint the United States prayed, among
other things, for a mandatory injunction against the Securities
Company requiring it to recall and cancel the certificates of
stock which it had issued, and to surrender the stock of the
two railway companies in exchange for which its stock had been
issued. This prayer for relief was denied. The court doubted
its power to compel stockholders of the Securities Company,
who had not been served with process, and were not before
the court otherwise than by representation (if, indeed, they
were present by representation), to surrender stock which was
in their possession, and to take other stock in lieu thereof.
It accordingly contented itself with an order which rendered
the stock of the two railway companies, so long as it was in
the hands of the Securities Company, valueless for the purpose
of carrying out the objects of the unlawful combination in
restraint of interstate trade.
"The Government was satisfied with the relief obtained,
and expresses itself as fully satisfied therewith at the present
time. When the decree was entered it was assumed by the
court that when the stock was thus rendered valueless in the
hands of the Securities Company the stockholders of that

company would be able, and likewise disposed, to make a disposition of the stock which, under all the circumstances of the
case, would be fair and just, and would restore it to the markets
of the world, Where it would have some value, instead of being
a worthless commodity. It was thought that the duty of
thus disposing of it could be safely left to the stockholders of
the Securities Company, and that, if any controversy arose in
the discharge of this function, in view of the situation that
had been created by the decree, it would be a controversy
that would properly form the subject matter of an independent
suit between the parties immediately interested.
"It is true that the decree contained a provision, in substance, that nothing therein contained should be construed
as prohibiting the Securities Company from returning to the
stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and
the Great Northern Railway Company any and all shares of
stock in either of said railway companies which the Northern
Securities Company had acquired in exchange for its own
stock, and that nothing therein contained should be construed as prohibiting the Securities Company from making
such transfer of the stock aforesaid to such person or persons
as had become owners of its own stock originally issued in
exchange for the stock in the two railway companies; but this
provision was purely permissive. It did not command that
the stock should be so returned, or exclude other methods of
disposition of it that, in view of all the circumstances, might
appear to be more equitable. The fact that the directors of
the Securities Company have proposed to its stockholders a
plan of distributing the stock of the two railway companies
in a manner somewhat different from that which was tentatively suggested by the decree, but not commanded, cannot
be regarded as a failure to obey the decree. It was said in
argument that one purpose of the intervention is to have that
clause of the decree which is now merely permissive made
mandatory. But this would be to modify the provisions of
a decree which had become final by affirmance, and make an

HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.
197 U. S.

291

Opinion of the Court.

order which we expressly and on full consideration declined
to make when the decree was entered. This we must decline
to do."
The decree of April 9, 1903, was affirmed by the judgment
of this court, which, of course, went no further than the decree
itself. We did, indeed, by our judgment leave the Circuit
Court at liberty "to proceed in the execution of its decree as
the circumstances may require," but this did not operate to
change the decree or import a power to do so not otherwise
possessed.
Counsel argue, however, that certain expressions in the
opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan so enlarged the scope of the
decree as to give it the effect now attributed to it by complainants.
This suggestion is inconsistent with the settled rule that
general expressions in an opinion, which are not essential to
dispose of a case, are not permitted to control the judgment
in subsequent suits. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399;
Caroll v. Caroll's Lessees, 16 How. 275. But we do not think
that the opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan is open to the construction put upon it. In speaking of the situation as between
the Government and the defendants, the Securities Company
is sometimes referred to as the custodian of the shares and
sometimes as the absolute owner, but in the sense that in
either view the combination was illegal. For the purposes of
that suit it was enough that in any capacity the Securities
Company had the power to vote the railway shares and to
receive the dividends thereon. The objection was that the
exercise of its powers, whether those of owner or of trustee,
would tend to prevent competition, and thus to restrain commerce.
Some of our number thought that as the Securities Company owned the stock the relief sought could not be granted,
but the conclusion was that the possession of the power, which,
if exercised, would prevent competition, brought the case
within the statute, no matter what the tenure of title was.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Treating the question as an open one, it seems to us indisputable that, as between these parties, the transaction was
one of purchase and sale. The situation is thus well put by
Dallas, J.:
"The resolution which authorized the acquisition of the
railway stock on behalf of the Securities Company was adopted
by its board of directors at a meeting at which Mr. Harriman
was present as a member of the board, and the only authority
it conferred was 'to purchase

said stock

.

.

.

at an

aggregate price of $91,407,500, payable, as to $82,491,871
thereof, in the fully paid-up and non-assessable shares of the
capital stock of this company at par, and as to $8,915,629, in
cash.' It is obvious that this resolution contemplated a 'purchase,' and not a bailment or trust; and that it accurately
stated the nature and terms of the contract which was actually
made by and with the Securities Company is unequivocally
shown by what was done in pursuance of it. The railway
shares were unconditionally assigned to that company. The
price specified in the resolution was paid by it, and this payment was made partly in cash and partly in shares of its own
stock, for which corporate certificates in the ordinary form
were delivered and accepted.

.

.

.

The complainants re-

ceived dividends upon the stock that was issued to them,
which were paid out of the general funds of the Securities
Company; and by its indenture to the Equitable Trust Company of New York the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company
irrefutably asserted its ownership of the Securities Company
stock which it thereby pledged."
And the Securities Company sold 75,000 shares of its stock
for $7,522,000 cash, "used," as stated in the bill, "for the
purchase of other property and for corporate purposes."
But assuming that the transaction was in form, and at
least prima jacie in substance, one of purchase and sale, it is
denied that the equitable title vested because, as alleged in
the second amended bill, there was an agreement by the
promoters of the Securities Company, carried out by that

HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.

293

Opinion of the Court.

company, that the latter should "acquire and hold the shares
of said railway stocks, as aforesaid, as custodian, depositary,
or trustee, and to issue in exchange therefor its own share
certificates upon said agreed basis." And here again we
concur in the views of the Circuit Court of Appeals as expressed
by Judge Dallas.
"The agreement thus set up is not in accord with the documentary evidence which has been referred to, and to establish
its existence a clear preponderance of proof should at least be
required, whereas, in our opinion, it conclusively appears that
no such agreement was ever made. Mr. Harriman himself
has distinctly testified that the Northern Pacific stock in question was sold; that the transaction was not an exchange; that
he, principally, negotiated the sale; and that there was not
attached to the negotiations any condition except as to price.
And to the same effect is his affidavit in this case, in which he
deposed that he was urged by Messrs. Morgan & Co. to dispose
of the Northern Pacific stock held by the Oregon Short Line
Company, and that 'they further stated that, upon the organization of the proposed holding company,' not that it
would take as custodian or trustee, but that 'they- would be
prepared to purchase the holdings of stock of the Northern
Pacific owned by the Oregon Short Line, and pay therefor in
the stock of the holding company.' These statements of that
one of the complainants having most knowledge of the subject,
confirmed, as they are, by other evidence, make it quite impossible to believe that the railway stock was received by the
Securities Company merely as a custodian or depositary. The
only agreement upon which it was transferred was an unqualified agreement of sale, and the fact that the design with
which the Securities Company was organized has been compulsorily abandoned has not divested or in any way affected
the absolute title which, by executed contract of purchase, it
acquired. Undoubtedly, it was anticipated by the complainants, as by all concerned, that the rights ordinarily incident to the ownership of stock, including the right to vote and

197 U. S.

to receive dividends, would be exercisable as to this stock by
the Securities Company. But expectation is not contract,
and therefore the frustration of this anticipation cannot be
said to have occasioned a failure of consideration. The only
consideration agreed upon was payment of the price, and admittedly that payment was made."
Complainants' counsel say, in respect of Mr. Harriman's
testimony that the transaction was an unconditional purchase
and sale, that he only swore to his opinion on a question of
law. This will hardly do when applied to testimony as to
what was said and done in conference with the alleged promoters of the Securities Company. When Mr. Harriman testified that he attached to his negotiations in the sale of Northern
Pacific stock no other condition than that of the price, andthat
the transaction was completed, how can complainants be permitted to deny that this was a statement of fact? And how
can the establishment of the contract and its terms as embodied in the resolutions of November 15, 1901, approved at
the succeeding meeting by the vote of Mr. Harriman, and
which appeared to be, and were testified to by Mr. Hill, President of the Securities Company, as constituting the only
contract which was made and authorized, be overthrown in
the absence of any evidence to the contrary?
The consideration received by complainants consisted of
money and Northern Securities stock certificates. Those
certificates were in common form, and each was a muniment
of the holder's title to a proportionate interest in the corporate estate vested in the corporation. By the provisions of
the corporation act of New Jersey, and its certificate of incorporation, the Securities Company had power to acquire
and to hold, and at any time to sell, the, shares of other corporations. And under that act it had power, in the discretion
of its directors and of the holders of two-thirds of its capital
stock, at any time, on notice, to dissolve and to wind up the
corporation and distribute its assets. Complainants subjected themselves to this power in accepting the shares of the

HARRIMAN v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.
197 U. S.

295

Opinion of the Court.

Northern Securities Company, and their unqualified transfer

of their railway stock was inconsistent with any obligation
of the Securities Company to retain the railway shares for any
particular period.
In acquiring the Securities stock, complainants acquired
the ordinary rights of stockholders in New Jersey business
corporations, including the right to receive dividends, and to
share in the distribution of the assets of the corporation on
its dissolution, or of any surplus of assets on reduction of its
capital stock. In view of the decree of the Circuit Court for
the District of Minnesota in the Government's suit the continued ownership of the railway shares became useless to the
stockholders of the Securities Company, and accordingly the
directors decided to reduce the capital stock and distribute
the surplus of assets created by that reduction, and the resolutions to that end were ratified by a vote of more than twothirds of the Securities shares.
By the transfer of the Northern Pacific shares and the payment therefor as agreed the contract was executed, and the
implied obligations resulting from the relation of corporation
and stockholder alone remained executory. And when the
Securities Company resolved to distribute these railway shares
ratably among all its stockholders, it did this in performance
of its contract with them and not in repudiation of it. It is
the complainants who are seeking the determination and
repudiation of the contract. Their final contention in that
regard is that they are entitled to a decree rescinding the contract of purchase and sale, and directing the return of the
railway shares parted with by them thereunder, because of
the illegality of the transaction as adjudged in the Federal
courts.
And this in defiance of. the settled rule that property delivered under an illegal contract cannot be recovered back
by any party in pari delicto. "The general rule, in equity,
a s at law," said Mr. Justice Gray in St. Louis, Vandalia &

against it will not be granted, at law or in equity, unless the
contract remains executory, or unless the parties are considered not in equal fault, as where the law violated is intended
for the coercion of the one party, and the protection of the
other, or where there has been fraud or oppression on the
part of the defendant. Thomas v. Richmond, 12 Wall. 349,
355; Spring Co. v. Knowlton, 103 U. S. 49; Story Eq. Jur.
§ 298.
"When the parties are in pari delicto, and the contract has
been fully executed on the part of the plaintiff, by the conveyance of property, or by, the payment of money, and has
not been repudiated by the defendant, it is now equally well
settled that neither a court of law nor a court of equity will
assist the plaintiff to recover back the property conveyed or
money paid under the contract. Thomas v. Richmond, supra;
Ayerst v. Jenkins, L. R. 16 Eq. 275, 284."
That was a suit in equity by the maker of an unauthorized
lease of a railway and franchises, against the lessee, to enforce
an attempted repudiation of the lease by the former, on the
ground of the illegality. The lease was for nine hundred and
ninety-nine years, of which but a few years had elapsed at
the date of the attempted rescission.
The illegality of the lease and the consequent breach of
public duty were manifest, but the right of the lessor, therefore, to maintain the suit was denied by this court.
In the present case complainants seek the return of property
delivered to the Securities Company pursuant to an executed
contract of sale on the ground of the illegality of that contract,
but the record discloses no special considerations of equity,
justice or public policy, which would justify the courts in relaxing the rigor of the rule which bars a recovery.
The Circuit Court decrees put at rest any question that the

ratable distribution resolved upon was in violation of public
policy.
And it is clear enough that the delivery to complainants of
a majority of the total Northern Pacific stock and a ratable
distribution of the remaining assets to the other Securities
stockholders would not only be in itself inequitable, but would
directly contravene the object of the ShermanLaw and the
purposes of the Government suit.
The Northern Pacific system, taken in connection with the
Burlington system, is competitive with the Union Pacific
system, and it seems obvious to us, the entire recofd considered, that the decree sought by complainants would tend to
smother that competition.
While the superior equities, as against complainants' present
claim, of the many holders of Securities shares who purchased
in reliance on the belief that they thereby acquired a ratable
interest in all of the assets of the Securities Company, are too
plain to be ignored.
The illegal contract could not be made legal by estoppel,
but the ownership of the assets, unaffected by a special interest
in complainants, could be placed beyond dispute on their part
by their conduct in holding the Securities Company out to the
world as unconditional owner.
And, without repeating in detail what has been already set
out, it is plain that right of rescission of the executed contract
of November 18, 1901, even if rescission could have otherwise
been sustained, had been lost by acquiescence and laches at
the time this bill was filed.
Since the transfer of that date Securities stock had passed
into the hands of more than 2,500 holders, many of them in
Great Britain, France and other parts of Europe; nearly a year
after the filing of the Government bill 75,000 shares were sold
for cash, complainant Harriman concurring; some months
after, Harriman and Pierce and the Oregon Short Line Company pledged their 824,000 shares to the Equitable Trust
Company; notwithstanding the decree of April 9, 1903, they

stood upon their rights as shareholders; and it was not until
after March 22, 1904, when defendant's board of directors
resolved upon a ratable distribution that complainants undertook to change an election already so pronounced as to be
irrevocable in itself in view of the rights of others.
We regard the contention that complainants are exempt
from the doctrine in pari delicto because the parties acted in
good faith and without intention' to violate the law as without
merit. With knowledge of the facts and of the statute, the
parties turned out to be mistaken in supposing that the statute
would not be held applicable to the facts. Neither can plead
ignorance of the law as against the other, and defendant secured no :unfair advantage in retaining the consideration
voluntarily delivered for the price agreed.
Perhaps it should be noticed that the bill sought the return
of two parcels of Northern Pacific common stock, the 370,230
shares delivered to the Securities Company, November 18,
1901, and the 347,090 shares received December 27,. 1901,
from the Northern Pacific Company on the retirement of preferred stock.
Early in 1901 the Hill-Morgan party held a majority of the
common stock, and had asserted the intention to retire the
preferred stock, "without," as Mr. Harriman testified, "affording the holders of the preferred stock the right to participate in any new securities that might be issued."
With full knowledge of that intention the proceedings of
the two companies followed in November, 101, and the absolute and unconditional sale and purchase, as we hold the
transaction to have been.
We find no evidence of any express agreement that complainants should be entitled to the new common stock, and it
was certainly not the natural increase of-the old stock, but
the result of the exercise of the right of subscription. The
purchase by the Securities Company was on its own account
and not in trust, and cannot be disturbed because of illegal
purpose at the clamor of parties in pari delicto. And there is

here no offer of the restoration of the status quo, if that were
practicable.
Doubtless it became the duty of the Securities Company to
end a situation that had been adjudged unlawful, and this
could be effected by sale and distribution in cash, or by distribution in kind, and the latter method was adopted, and
wisely adopted, as we think, for the forced sale of several
hundred millions of stock would have manifestly involved
disastrous results.
In fine, the title to these stocks having intentionally been
passed, the former owners or part of them cannot reclaim the
specific shares and must be content with their ratable proportion of the corporate assets.
Decree affirmed; cause remanded to Circuit Court with a direction to-dismiss the bill.

No. 178. Argued March 14, 1905.-Decided April 3, 1905.

A foreign corporation sued in a state court appeared specially and objected
to the jurisdiction on the sole ground that the person served was notl its
agent within the meaning of the state statute; the lower court sustained
the objection, but on plaintiff's ippeal the highest court of the State
held the service good; defendant then demurred on the ground that the
statute as to service on foreign corporations was violative of the Federal
Constitution; on second appeal after the demurrer had been overruled
and there had been judgment for plaintiff on the merits, the highest court
ot the State declined to consider the constitutionality of the statute on
the ground that the question of jurisdiction had been settled on the first
appeal. Held, that the writ of error must be dismissed. Had the objection been raised in the first instance and disposed of on plaintiff's
