NATIONAL COTTON OIL COMPANY ,. TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS IN AN!) FOR THE THIRD
SUPREME JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TIlE STATE OF TEXAS.
No. 37. Argled November 1,2, 1904.-Decided February 27, 1905.

The Anti-Trust Acts of Texas of 1889, 1895 and 1899, are all directed to the
prohibitions of combinations to restrict trade, to in any way limit competition in the production or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce
prices in order to preclude free and unrestricted competition; and, as the
legislature of a State may ordain that competition and not combination
shall be the law of trade, and may prohibit combinations to control
prices, the statutes as they now stand are not in conflict with the Four
teenth Amendment and do not, as against corporations dealing in cotton
oil and combining to regulate the price of cotton seed, work a deprivation
of property without due process of law, or impair theiir liberty of contract.
The idea of monopoly is not now confined to a grant of privileges but is
understood to include a condition produced by the acts of individuals
and the suppression of competition by unification of interest or management or through agreement and concert of action. It is the power to
control prices which makes both the inducement to Inake such combinations and the concern of the law to prohibit them.
The Supreme Court of Texas having construed the act of 1895 as invalid,
so far as it was discriminatory by excepting from its operation combinations of agriculturists and organi:ed laborers and fell within the terms
of Conolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 II. S. 540, and sustained the
act in other respects, and having also held that the act of 1899 although
cumulative did not continue the invalid discriminatory provisions of the

197 U. S.

act of 1895, this court follows the state court in holding that under the
laws of Texas, as they now exist, combinations described in the AntiTrust Laws are forbidden and penalized whether by agriculturists, organized laborers or others, and there is therefore no discrimination against
oil companies, and the latter are not deprived of the equal protection
of the laws.

THIS suit was brought under the Anti-Trust Acts of the
State of Texas, to forfeit the license of the National Cotton
Oil Company to do business in the State of Texas, for violating
those acts. The defense is that the acts are repugnant to the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States.
The suit was instituted by the Attorney General of the State
and the District Attorney of the Twenty-sixth Judicial District, and the petition alleged the following facts: The National
Cotton Oil Company and the Southern Cotton Oil Company are
New Jersey corporations, doing and transacting business in
the State of Texas by reason of a permit issued to them respectively on the second day of May, 1900, and the third day
of June, 1897.
The Taylor Cotton Oil Works is a Texas corporation, doing
business in the State under a charter granted August 25, 1898.
The said foreign corporations, from the date of their respective
permits and the Taylor Cotton Oil Works from the date of its
charter have been and are. "engaged in the business of the
manufacture and sale of cotton seed oil, cotton seed meal and
the other by-products of cotton seed; that the business in
which each and all of such corporations were engaged necessitated the .purchase of cotton seed from Which the products
which they manufactured and sold were made, and that said
cotton seed was an article and commodity of merchandise:"
Each of them on or about the first of November, 1901, and
on every day prior and subsequent thereto, has been engaged
iI the business of buying cotton seed in the various counties
of the State, and on the first of November, 1901, the National
Cotton Oil Company made and entered into a combination
with each of the other companies and they with it, and each

of them with various other persons, firms and corporations,
whose names are to the defendant in error unknown, and the
said corporations "became members of and parties to a pool,
trust, agreement, confederation and understanding with each
of the other of said corporations,. firms and persons, whereby
they did each for itself and with each other and all together
agree to regulate and fix, and did. regulate and fix, the price
at which-they would buy cotton seed; that they especially
regulated and fixed the price of cotton seed throughout the
State of Texas at $14.00 per ton, and agreed amongst and
with each other that they would not give more,'than said
$14.00 per ton for cotton seed in any of the towns and communities of the State of Texas." Whereby, "and by maintaining the agreement to regulate and fix the price of cotton
seed aforesaid, the-defendant (the National Cotton Oil Company) was guilty of a violation of the laws of the State of
Texas," and in consequence has forfeited its permit to transact
business in the State. The cancellation and forfeiture of the
permit was prayed, and that the oil company be enjoined
from transacting business in the State.
A demurrer was filed to the petition for insufficiency in
law to entitle the State to any relief, and alleged against
each of the Anti-Trust Acts of the State and the provisions of
the Penal Code based thereon, that they violated section 1,
Art. XIV, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the
United States, in that the act of March 30, 1889, and the code
provisions based thereon, deprived the company of the equal
protection of the laws, because it was provided by section thirteen of said act and article 988 of the Penal Code that the said
statutes "shall not apply to agricultural products or live stock
while in the hands of the producer or raiser." And that the
act of April 30, 1895, and certain sections of the Revised Statutes of Texas and of the Penal Code were likewise discriminatory because of the same exceptions, and the further exception
that said statutes should not be held to "be understood or
construed to prevent the organization of laborers for the

197 U. S.

purpose of maintaining any standard of wages;" and the act
of May 25, 1899, because it was cumulative and a mere supplement to the others, and carried, therefore, the same unconstitutional discriminations.
All of the acts and code provisions are charged with depriving the oil company of its property without due process of law
and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that the
penalties are excessive and their provisions so vague and
uncertain that the company is denied a resort to the tribunals
of the country to defend its rights except on the condition
that, if not successful, it shall subject its property to confiscation and forfeit its right to do business in the State.
It is also urged as a ground of demurrer that the act of 1895
violated a provision of the constitution of the State which
prohibited a bill to contain more than one subject.
The demurrer was overruled. The company declined to
answer further, and judgment was entered forfeiting the license
or permit of the company, and enjoining the company from
transacting any business in the State "except such business
as may be and constitute interstate commerce." The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.

A rehearing

was denied and a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the
State refused.

This writ of error was then granted.

Mr. William V. Rowe and Mr. R. S. Lovett, with whom
Mr. Ralph Oakley and Mr. James A. Baker were on the brief,
for plaintiff in error in this case and in No. 38 argued simultaneously herewith.1
The acts of 1889 and 1895 are in contravention of section 1,
Article XIV, of the Amendments of the Constitution of the
United States, and therefore .void, because of the provisions
permitting agriculturists, live stock raisers and laborers to
form combinations denounced by the acts when formed by

others.

Revised Statutes and Penal Code, the legislature exempted
certain classes from punishment for the same offense charged
in this case, and, such discriminating provisions being unrepealed and unaffected by the Anti-Trust Act of 1899, the
whole system of statutes is, as a consequence, unconstitutional.
The decisions of the Texas Supreme Court and the legi$lative enactments show that the legislature intended that the
exemption of agriculturists, stock raisers and laborers should
remain unimpaired by the Anti-Trust Act of 1897. Texas

Co., 67 S. W. Rep. 1049; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 19
T. C. A. 1; Houck v. Anheuser &c., 88 Texas, 184.
Taking all the statutes together the act of 1899 is a mere
addition to the previous acts and a part of them. The acts
being clearly in pari materia, they must of course be read
together and treated as parts of one system. Potter's Dwarris,

Where the question is merely one of the construction of a
state statute, which does not necessarily involve a Federal
question the determination of the state. court' is conclusive
upon this court. Osborne v. Florida, 164 U. S. 650, 656. But
this court is not bound by state court decisions construing,
state statutes, where a Federal question is involved. See as

distinguished.
This case comes within the principle of these exceptions.
This court cannot accept as conclusive the decision of the
state court as to the scope, meaning and effect of this admitted exemption clause, effecting, when construed with the
other statutes of the State, in pari materia, what is claimed
to be an arbitrary classification of persons, in respect to the
offense in question, in violation of the rights guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment. That, like the qjuestions of due
process of law, full faith and credit to which state judgments
are entitled, and of the impairment of contract obligations is,
essentially and necessarily, a question for the final and independent determination of this court.
Plaintiff in error is really asking this court not to controvert, but rather to lean towards, and follow, the state court
on this subject.
Since the Anti-Trust Statutes are in contravention of the
Federal Constitution they are absolutely void; and are ineffectual for any purpose against corporations as well as individuals. Cooley's Const. Lim., 5th ed., 224; Reagan v. Trust
Co., 154 U. S.362; West. Un. Tel. Co. v. State, 62 Texas, 630.

197 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

The Supreme Court of Texas has refused to follow this
court in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540,
nor does Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28, support
its decision. See N. Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 389.
The right of the State to forfeit defendant's license depends
upon the conditions annexed expressly or by implication to
the grant made by the license. If the Anti-Trust Statutes were
a part of the contract and have been violated, the forfeiture
may be enforced, but if they were not, then they do not enter
into the contract at all, but are mere statutes, not contracts,
and their validity may be contested by this defendant, as well
as by an individual.
While corporations are not "citizens," within the meaning
of ยง 2, Art. IV, of the Federal Constitution, Paul v. Virginia,
8 Wall. 168; Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239, yet they are
"persons" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and may invoke that provision against the taking of their
property without due process of law, and the denial of the
equal protection of the laws, Santa Clara County v. Southern
Pacific Ry. Co., 118 U. S. 394; Covington Turnpike Co. v.
Sandford, 164 U. S. 578, 592; Smythe v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466,
522; and this is true of a foreign corporation which has obtained a license to transact business in the State.
A state statute which violates the Federal Constitution is
not binding upon a corporation nor is it valid in any respect.

v. Minnesota, 180 U. S. 452; Cable v. U. S. Life Ins. Co., 191

v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 267; Doyle v.' Insurance Co., 94 U. S. 535,
distinguished, and see Baron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186.
While state legislation has been sustained against foreign
corporations none of the cases are based on the ground that
the only remedy sought by the State is forfeiture of corporate
grants. Fidelity Mutual Life Assn. v. Mettler, 185 11. S. 308;

178 U. S. 389.
While the power of the State to impose terms upon a foreign
corporation seeking admission was distinctly recognized yet
these cases are clearly distinguished from Connolly v. Union
Sewer Pipe Co., and other cases in which this court has protected foreign corporations against unconstitutional state legislation.
The contention that a corporation may be bound by a statute which violates the Federal Constitution is unsound, dangerous and contrary to many decisions of this court. Insurance
Company v. French, 18 How. 404; Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20
Wall. 445; Barron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186; Southern Pacific
Co. v. Denton, 146 U. S. 202; Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane,

66 Fed. Rep. 809, 814; Reimers v. Seatco Mfg. Co., 70 Fed.
Rep. 573. While these cases involved statutes which required foreign corporations, as one of the conditions imposed
in granting the license, to refrain from removing such suits
as might be brought against them, into, the courts of the
United States, that does not in any wise affect the principle.
That provision is no more sacred than any other.
All of the Anti-Trust Laws of Texas are also in contravention
of the Fourteenth Amendment for the reason that they necessarily deprive persons of liberty and property without due
process of law, in that they deny all persons the right to make
any contract, in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary business subjects, which tends to restrict competition
or tra(de, commerce or business, or in any manner to affect
prices. 2 Idddy on Comb. ยงยง 904 et seq.

The right of all persons to combine for the purpose of carrying on an ordinary business in the familiar dnd ordinary
methods sanctioned by the continuous commercial usages of
the Anglo-Saxon race and by the common law is one of the
liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and, as
the corporation is in the State without conditions, to inpair
this liberty and the ability to conduct a merchandising or other
business in the ordinary way, through the making of purchases and sales and the fixing of prices, is clearly to work a
deprivation of property without due process of law, and to
impair the well recognized liberty of contract, involved in the
acquiring, using and dealing with property, protected by that
amendment to the Federal Constitution. L. S. & Mich. So.

Mr. C. K. Bell, Attorney General for the State of Texas,
for defendant in error in this case and in No. 38:
It has been held by the Supreme Court of the State of Texas
that the laws of 1889 and 1895 were valid and constitutional
enactments. But after Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co.,
184 U. S. 540, the decisions theretofore rendered by the appellate courts of Texas, upholding the laws mentioned so far
as it was sought under them to collect penalties, were overruled and the laws held to be nugatory when penalties were
sought to be collected for a violation of their provisions. The
law of 1899 contained no exemption in favor of any class, and
this law has been held by the Supreme Court of Texas, in
State v. Laredo Ice Co., 96 Texas, 461, to be a valid and constitutional enactment.
The questions in this case are, first, is the Anti-Trust Act
of Texas of 1899 constitutional; and, second, conceding that
the acts of 1889 arid 1895 are not constitutional to the extent
of warranting the collection of penalties for a violation of their
provisions, is it within the power of the courts to forfeit the
permit which authorizes a foreign corporation to transact
business in the State of Texas for committing the acts which
by such statutes they are prohibited from conmitting under
penalty of forfeiting such permits?

TTON OIL CO. v. TEXAS.
Opinion of the Court.

The first question has been answered by the Supreme Court
of Texas in State v. Laredo Ice Co., 96 Texas, 461, in the affirmative, and nothing can be added to the strength of the opinion
in that case, and this court will follow the interpretation placed
upon a statute of a State by its highest court.
As to the second question, the identical proposition has been
decided in Waters-PierceOil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28; WatersPierce Oil Co. v. State, 19 Civ. App. 1; State v. Shippers' Compress and Warehouse Co., 95 Texas, 603.
after stating the case as above,
delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JUSTICE McKENNA,

The charges made against the statutes of Texas are that
they deny the oil company the equal protection of the law and
take its property without due process of law. The answer to
the first depends upon the effect of the statutes. The answer
to the second involves their validity and broader considerations. We will deal with it first.
The specification in the demurrer of wherein the statutes
deprive the oil company of its property without due process of
law is indefinite and peculiar. It may be different from an
attack on the validity of the statutes, but counsel have treated
it as tantamount to such attack, and we will so treat it.
Defendant in error contends that it is not open to the oil
company to attack the constitutionality of the statutes, either
as discriminating against it or as depriving it of property without due process of law, 'and cites Waters-Pierce Oil Company
v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28. Counsel for the company contests the
application of that case; and we will assume (not decide) with
them that it is not determinative of their contention.
The acts of 1889 and 1895 are set out at length in the WatersPierceOil Company case. The act of 1899, so far as the present
question is concerned, is substantially the same as those acts.
All of the acts are directed to the prohibition of combinations
to restrict trade, or in any way limit competition in the pro-

duction or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce their price
in order to preclude a free and unrestricted competition in
them. The various ways in which these purposes can be accomplished are enumerated and forbidden. Penalties are
affixed to the violation of the acts, offending domestic corporations forfeit their charters, and offending foreign corporations forfeit their privileges to do business in the State.
There was also an act passed in 1903, which repealed all laws
or parts of laws in conflict with it, and expressly repealed certain provisions of the Penal Code of the State, and the acts of
1895 and 1899. The right to recover penalties or to forfeit
charters of domestic, or the permits of foreign, corporations,
for acts committed before the going into effect of the statutes,
was reserved.
The argument, which is directed against the validity of the
statutes, is drawn from extremes. It is difficult to present its
elements in a concise way. Its ultimate foundation is the
right of individuals and corporations as well, under the Constitution of the United States, to make contracts and combine
in business enterprises; and, it is argued, to prohibit them from
so doing" in the ordinary way through the making of purchases
and sales and the fixing of prices, is clearly to work a deprivation of property without due process of law and to impair the
well recognized liberty of contract, involved in the acquiring,
using and dealing with property," assured by the Federal
Constitution.
To support the argument the usages and necessity of business
are adduced, and partnerships and their effect are brought
forward as illustrations. There are some things which counsel
easily demonstrate. They easily demonstrate that some combination of "capital, skill or acts " is necessary to any business
development, and that the result must inevitably be a cessation of competition. But this does not prove that all combinations are inviolable or that no restriction upon competition
can be forbidden. To contend for these extremes is to overlook the difference in the effect of actions, and to limit too

much the function and power of government. By arguing
from extremes almost every exercise of government can be
shown to be a deprivation of individual liberty. It is commonplace to say that it is the purpose, and indeed duty, of government, to get all it can of good out of the activities of men, and
limit or forbid them when they become or tend to evil. Of
course, what is evil may not be always clear; but to be able
to dispute the policy of a law is not to establish its invalidity.
It is certainly the conception of a large body of public opinion
that the control of prices through combinations tends to restraint of trade and to monopoly, and is evil. The foundations of the belief we are not called upon to discuss, nor does
our purpose require us to distinguish between the kinds of
combinations or the degrees of monopoly. It is enough to
say that the idea of monopoly is not now confined to a grant of
privileges. It is understood to include a "condition produced
by the acts of mere individuals." Its dominant thought now
is, to quote another, "the notion of exclusiveness or unity;"
in other words, the suppression of competition by the unification of interest or management, or it may be through agreement and concert of action. And the purpose is so definitely
the control of prices that monopoly has been defined to be
"unified tactics with regard to prices." It is the power to
control prices which makes the inducement of combinations
and their profit. It is such power that makes it the concern
of the law to prohibit or limit them. And this concern and
the policy based upon it has not only expression in the Texas
statutes; it has expression in the statutes of other States and
in a well known national enactment. According to them,
competition not combination, should be the law of trade. If
there is evil in this it is accepted as less than that which may
result from the unification of interest, and the power such
unification gives. And that legislatures may so ordain this
court has decided. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156

In Smiley v. Kansas, decided at this term, 196 U.. S. 447,
a statute of Kansas is passed on which is identical in effect,
and even in words, in all that concerns the present- controversy, with the Texas statutes. The statute was assailed as
"an unwarranted attempt upon the part of the legislature to
limit the rights of the individual in the matter of contracting
and dealing with his fellow-men." The right which Smiley
claimed was to combine with certain grain dealers, persons,
companies and corporations, who were competitors, to pool
and fix the price of grain in the town of Bison, and to prevent
competition in the purchase and sale of grain at that place.
We--followed the ruling of the. Supreme Court of the State in
holding that the combination was within the prohibition of the
statute; we concurred -with that court in deciding that the prohibition was a valid exercise of the police power of the State.
It follows that the statutes of Texas do not deprive the oil
company of its property without due process of law.
Next, as to the effect of the statutes.
The act of May 25, 1899, omits the discriminatory provisions
of the prior acts, but, it is contended, that as the latter act is
declared to be cumulative of the prior acts their discriminations are preserved and continued, and that under the Code
provisions the company may be criminally prosecuted, and
that the excepted classes of the acts of, 1889 and 1895 are
exempt from prosecution. It is further urged whether such
discrimination results from the statutes is for us. to determine
independently of. what views the courts of the State may
entertain of them and their relations.
Upon the last contention depends the mode of approaching
the other, and we will dispose of it first. We cannot assent
to it. There are cases in which we determine for ourselves the
meaning of a state law, but this is not one of them. I The contention of the company is that the statutes of the State discriminate against it; in other words, deny it the equal protec-

tion of the law, by forbidding it from loing what they permit
others to do in similar eireunstmees punish iktacts and
exempt from punishment tle same acts when (hne by others.
But the courts of the State are the tribunals appointed to
administer the statutes and impose their penalties, and to do
so they must necessarily interpret them. In other words,
they are the tribunals to declare the meaning of the statutes,
and if in declaring it they make the statutes discriminatory
then may the statutes become unconstitutional. Olsen v.
Smith, 195 U. S. 332.
What has the Supreme Court of Texas said of the statutes?
The Court of Civil Appeals in the case at bar expresse(t the
following .view:
"The trial court did not err in overruling appellant's demurrers. While it has been correctly held that certain provisions of the anti-trust statutes are unconstitutional, the Supreme Court, in the case of The Slate of Texas v. The Shippers'
Compress & Warehouse Co., 69 S. W. Rep. 61, relying upon
the case of The Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. The State of Texas,
177 U. S. 28, holds that so much of these statutes that authorize the canceling and forfeiture of a charter or permit to
do business within the State of Texas are valid, and are not
in violation of the constitution."
The Supreme Court refused a writ of error, an(l thereby, as
we understand the local rule to be, approved the views of the
Court of Civil Appeals. Subsequently the Supreme Court expressed itself explicitly in State of Texas v. Shippers' Compress
and Warehouse Company, 95 Texas, 603, and State of Texas
v. Laredo Ice Company, 96 Texas, 461.
The object in State of Texas v. Shippers' Compress and
Warehouse Company was to forfeit the charter of the compress
company for violating. the Anti-Trust Law of 1895, in that the
incorporators combined "to restrict aids to commerce." The
law was attacked as unconstitutional. To the contention the
court said:
"The defendant insists that the law is unconstitutional,

therefore void in whole, and will not support the action to
forfeit the charter. Upon the same objection we held the
Anti-Trust Law of 1889 to be constitutional, and there is no
such difference between the two laws as would affect the decision of this question. We believe that our decision is correct; that the law is not in contravention of the constitution
of the State nor of the United States. Honck v. Brewing
Assn., 88 Texas, 189."
The court then referred to Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe
Co., 184 U. S. 540, and in submission to its authority held the
law of 1895, so far as it came within the terms of that case,
invalid, and would not support an action by the State to
recover a penalty for a violation of the law, nor would it, in
suits between corporations and individuals, support a defense
based upon the fact that the right of action originated in
violation of the Anti-Trust Law. "But," the court remarked,
"to the extent that the statute of this State is not embraced
in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, we
shall adhere to our former decision that it is constitutional
and valid, and therefore enforcible by the State."
That is, the court decided the act of 1895 was valid to the
extent that it authorized the State to revoke the license of a
foreign corporation and to forfeit the charter of a domestic
corporation. The other provisions of the act were held invalid, and the right to make this distinction was based on
Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas.
State of Texas v. Laredo Ice Co. was instituted to recover
penalties for the violation of the Anti-Trust Law of 1899. The
ice company -was a domestic corporation, and it was proceeded
against for having formed a combination to regulate and fix
prices. In defense, the company asserted the unconstitutionality of the act.
It is provided in section 14 of the act of 1899 that the provisions of preceding sections and the fines and penalties provided for violations of the act shall be held and construed to
be cumulative of all laws now in force in the State. It was

NATIONAL COTTON OIL CO. v. TEXAS.

Opinion of the Court.

contended, as it is contended here, that this provision made
one law of the act and the act of 1895, and that the exemptions of the latter became part of the former and made it unconstitutional. In other words, the effect was (we quote
from the opinion of the court) "thereby to give exemption
from prosecution under the law of 1899 to those persons who
are exempted by the provisions of the law of 1895." The
Supreme Court of Texas rejected the contention. Its reasoning was not very direct or circumstantial, but it in effect held
that the act of 1899 did not continue the provisions of the
prior acts, whether constitutional or unconstitutional, merely
because it was declared to be cumulative. And the court decided the law of 1899 to be constitutional, because it did not
contain the discriminating features of the prior laws. Under
the laws of Texas, therefore, combinations of the kind described in the various anti-trust laws, whether by agriculturalists or organized laborers or others, are forbidden and
penalized, and the oil company is not discriminated against.
But it may be said that if the inequalities of prior antitrust acts have been removed by the act of 1899, they still
remain in the Revised Statutes of the State and in the Penal
Code, and by those Statutes and that Code the excepted classes
are exempted from indictment and punishment, while the oil
company is subject to both. We need not consider the Statutes referred to or consider how far this discrimination can
exist, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of the
State in State of Texas v. Laredo ice Company. Granting it
can exist, the case at bar is not a criminal -prosecution. It
involves only the anti-trust laws and their prohibitions, and
penalties. And in them, we have seen, by the effect of the
act of 1899 there is'no inequality of operation. It is the effect
of that decision also that the laws of the State against combinations and trusts are formed into a harmonious system, of
which the criminal provisions in other statutes and the Code
are a part, and that their provisions can be adjusted and
reconciled so as to have constitutional operation.
Judgment affirmed.
