exceeded his power we have to consider what might have been
before his mind.
As we have said, it would be only by a very literal construction of the earlier part of ยง 25, that the collectors would
be bound to estimate the value of a cargo invoiced in rupees
by the bullion of the rupee when in the invoice rupee meant
a certain fraction of a pound. But, however that may be, we
are of opinion that when the Secretary has satisfactory evidence of that state of facts, under the proviso he is authorized
to order a reliquidation in order to make the value in United
States currency correspond with the actual value of the goods.
It is not necessary to consider any wider problems as to the
power of the Secretary. We confine our decision to the
particular case.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. BARNES.
APPEAL

FROM THE COURT

OF CLAIMS.

No. 143. Argued January 23, 1905.-Decided February 27, 1905.

Findings of fact made by the Court of Claims are conclusive here, and the
jurisdiction of this court is limited to determination of questions of law.

accepted notwithstanding it was under verbal directions of the Commissioners and not under written contract as required by prior acts of
Congress.
The main purpose of the Court of Claims is to arrive at and adjudicate the
justice of alleged claims against the United States, and the court is not
bound by special rules of pleading.

THE action now appealed was brought under the act 6f
June 16, 1880, known as the District of Columbia Claims Act.
21 Stat. 284. The original petition was filed August 4, 1880.
At subsequent stages of the case amendecY petitions were filed.
On October 1, 1887, the Court of Claims decided the case in
favor of the District of Columbia, giving judgment against the
claimant for the sum of $11,074.11. 22 C. Cl. 366. On November 18, 1887, the claimant filed a motion for a new trial,
which was submitted on March 28, 1895, and allowed on
April 1, 1895. The case was then referred, as provided in the
act, and upon report and hearing judgment was rendered on
November 11, 1895, against the District for the claimant in the
sum of $31,754.57; being rendered for Barnes in the sum of
$22,350.54, and for Ritchie, assignee, in the sum of $9,404.03,
both sums due and payable as of January 1, 1876. On April 20,
1896, the defendant filed its motion for a new trial, which was
granted on May 18,, 1896. On March 31, 1902, the court
rendered a judgment in favor of the claimant, and his' assignee,
in the sum of $23,694.47, due and payable as of March 1, 187i.
37 C. Cl. 342. On April 22, 1902, an appeal was taken by the
District from the judgment of March 31, 1902, to this court.
This appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Barnes

Under the act of March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1031, 1070, this

District, bringing the case in review before this court.

in the Court of Claims. So much of the findings will be commented on as is necessary to a determination of the legal questions involved, which are within a narrow compass. Nor do
we find it necessary to consider the alleged discrepancies between the judgment of the Court of Claims, when the judgment was in favor of the District, 22 C. Cl. 366, and the find-

ings and conclusions when the judgment was rendered which
is now appealed to this court. 37 C. Cl. 342.
This court does not sit to review findings of fact made in the
Court of Claims. They are regarded as conclusive here, and
our jurisdiction is limited to a determination of such questions of law as are properly brought to our attention upon the
record. United States v. Smith, 94 U. S. 214, 218.
The original action was brought in part on two contracts,
which were in writing, duly executed by the claimant and in
behalf of the District of Columbia, and known as Nos. 264 and
413, and were for certain street improvements in the city of
Washington. These contracts were entered into on April 29
and July 23, 1872, respectively, under authority of the act of
February 21, 1871. 16 Stat. 419, 427. Certain verbal agreements are also set up as having been entered into between the
claimant and the Commissioners of the District.
The Court of Claims, under the proofs, heard the parties
upon the question as to the right to reform the two written
contracts. It refused to reform contract No. 413, and decreed
in favor of the District in the sum of $13,039.79 for over payments made upon that contract. The court did reform contract No. 264, finding that, by mistake in the drafting of the
contract, "the rate of 40 cents for grading old gravel streets
to a depth of two feet" was omitted therefrom by mutual
mistake of the parties, and that the written contract was
executed without observing the omission. Upon the contract
as reformed the claimant was permitted to recover for work
done. Much of the discussion in the oral argument and the
brief of the learned counsel for the Government is directed to
the authority of the Court of Claims to reform a written contract in the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity for
that purpose, and much discussion was had as to the various
acts conferring jurisdiction upon that court. But we think
a construction of the act under cover of which this suit was
prosecuted is all that is necessary to determine the question.
The act of June 16, 1880; as appears by its title, was intended

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. BARNES.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to confer on the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine all outstanding claims against the District of Columbia.
For that purpose it was recited in the first section of the act
that the jurisdiction of the court should extend to and it should
have original legal and equitable jurisdiction of claims arising
out of the contracts made by the Board of Public Works and
extensions made thereof by the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia, and also of the claims arising out of the contracts
made by the Commissioners since the act of June 20, 1874,
and broadly for all claims for work (lone by order or direction
of the Commissioners, and accepted by them for the use,
purposes or benefit of the District of Columbia, and prior to
the fourteenth day of March, 1876.
The language used is of the most comprehensive character,
and confers, for the purposes stated, original legal and equitable jurisdiction.
It is true that the purpose of the various acts conferring
jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims has been held to be to
permit the adjudication of money demands against the United
States, and it may be that under this act, as under others,
there was no intention to confer equity jurisdiction beyond
that which is required to enable a court to determine whether
money relief should be granted. The intent of the act was to
enable parties to submit the justice of their claims against theUnited States to adjudication in a competent court. For that
purpose the act conferred in terms, equitable as well as legal
jurisdiction.
The province of the Court of Claims is to pass upon the
justice of the claim and adjudge accordingly. And it is obviously intended that, when necessary to adjudicate claims
against the District, the court shall be unhampered in the
exercise of jurisdiction, and as in many courts of this country
having a civil code, there has been conferred upon the same
tribunal the power to grant the necessary legal and equitable
relief. One who has the right to money relief upon a contract
mistakenly omitted to be reduced to writing, in accordance

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

with the true agreement of the parties, has a ulaim of equitable
cognizance, for the contract must be reformed to meet the
intention of the parties, and when corrected may be adjudged
a valid claim.
For the purpose of adjudicating such claims this statute
gives to the court equitable jurisdiction in order that it may
determine what the District ought to pay to the claimant.
Although unable to grant a decree for specific performance or
exercise the peculiar powers of a court of equity, the Court of
Claims may determine the money relief to which the claimant
is entitled, whether arising out of an equitable or legal demand.
This principle was recognized in United States v. Jones, 131
U. S. 1, 18. The Court of Claims in other cases has exercised
the equitable jurisdiction conferred in the act of June 16, 1880,
Cullinane v. District of Columbia, 18 C. Cl. 577, 594, and like
jurisdiction to reform contracts under the act of March 3, 1887,
24 Stat. 505, South Boston Iron Works v. United States, 34
C. Cl. 174.
We think that the court had jurisdiction to reform the
contract upon the facts found.
It is objected that the Court of Claims awarded relief for
certain "stiff clay" excavated under claimant's contract. The
findings show that this work was not specifically covered by
the original agreement, and that the work was accepted by
the Commissioners, and the District received the benefit
thereof; and the court finds that the excavation of the stiff
clay was done under a verbal agreement with the Commissioners after the performance of the original contract, and
that the claimant was entitled to the rate established therefor,
as paid to other contractors for like work.
The act of June 16, 1880, permits a recovery for work done
by order and direction of the Commissioners and accepted by
them for the benefit of the District. While it has been held
that this would not authorize a recovery for work done under
the original contract, at higher prices than had been agreed
upon, yet where there was a revival of the contract for distinct

Opinion of the Court.

work there might be a recovery at higher rates, which entered
into the terms of renewal as understood by the parties, notwithstanding the preexisting contract. Campbell and Eslin
v. District of Columbia, 18 C. Cl. 193.
The act of 1874 gave limited power to the Commissioners,
and in the act of February 21, 1871, 16 Stat. 419, providing
for contracts of the Board of Public Works, it was distinctly
provided that all contracts should be in writing and signed
by the parties making the same. And it was held that this
statute requires contracts to be actually signed and that mere
entries on the journals of the board would not satisfy the
statute. Barnard v. District of Columbia, 127 U. S. 409, 411.
But under the statute, June 16, 1880, now under consideration, the intention is manifest to permit the Court of Claims to
adjudicate claims for all work done by the order and direction
of the Commissioners, and accepted by them for the use,
purpose and benefit of the District. For this purpose this is
a remedial statute, and it is intended to permit parties to have
an adjudication upon their demands where the District had
been benefited by work actually done under the order and
direction of the Commissioners and duly accepted. And the
findings of fact show that the claimant was only permitted to
recover for work so performed and accepted. As we have said,
this right of recovery might not revive claims for work completed under former contracts, but here the finding is that the
new agreement applied to a distinct subject matter and not to
work covered by and performed under the original agreement.
We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Claims in this
regard. And so as to various sums awarded under findings of
fact, establishing that more work was made necessary by
reason of the change of grade on North Carolina avenue by the
Commissioners in 1874, the change of grade making it necessary to further grade Third street, and to do work for that
purpose. The findings show that this was done by the direc-

tion of the Commissioners and upon terms mutually agreed
upon. Under Finding XIV, where the work is found not to

have been done under the original contract, it is found that it
was admitted by the'(lefen(lant to be correct, and is work of
which the District has received the full benefit. So as to other
findings to which exceptions are made, there is no dispute that
the work was actually (lone to the satisfaction of the Comimiissioners upon terms agreed upon and the work duly accepted.
As we construe the statute, we think it affords ample authority to grant relief upon the facts found, which findings are
conclusive upon us.
It is further urge(l by counsel for the Government that the
pleadings are not sufficient to authorize the judgment, but we
think that under the original petition and various amendinents thereto the court was authorized to grant the relief
adjudged.
The Court of Claims is not bound by special rules of pleading. The main purpose is to arrive at and adjudicate the
justice of alleged claims against the United States. United
States v. Burns, 12 Wall. 246, 254; United States v. Behan, 110
U. S. 338, 347.
On the whole record we find no error of law to the prejudice
of the District.
Judgment affirmed.
