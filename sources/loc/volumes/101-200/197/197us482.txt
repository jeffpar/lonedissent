In re COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,
PETITIONER.
ORIGINAL.
No. 15.

Argued February 27, 28, 105.-Decided April 10, 1905.

in a proceeding brought by a State on petition for writs of prohibition,
mandamus or certiorari, to restrain the justices of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia from proceeding further in an action brought
by a citizen of the District of Columbia against the Secretary of the
Treasury to enjoin him from issuing to the Governor of the petitioning
State a duplicate warrant, held, that this court has no original jurisdiction
and as the controversy was not one between a State and citizens of another State, and under the act of February 9, 1893, 27 Stat. 434, establishing the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, this court has
no appellate jurisdiction as it cannot review judgments and decrees of
the Supreme Court of the District directly by appeal or writ of error.
In cases over which this court has no original or appellate jurisdiction it
cannot grant prohibition, mandamus or certiorari as ancillary thereto.

By an act of Congress of the United States approved July 27,
1861, 12 Stat. 276, c. 21, it was provided:
"That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby,
directed, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, to pay to the Governor of any State, or to his
duly authorized agents, the costs, charges, and expenses
properly incurred by such State for enrolling, subsisting,
clothing, supplying, arming, equipping, paying, and transporting its troops employed in aidifig to suppress the present
insurrection against the United States, to be settled upon
proper vouchers, to be filed and passed upon by the proper
accounting officers of the Treasury."
On March 20, 1888, the legislature of Massachusetts passed
the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the Governor and council are hereby authorized to employ the agent of the Commonwealth for the
prosecution of war claims against the United States, to prose-

cute also the claim of the Commonwealth for a refund of the
direct tax paid under act of Congress approved August fifth
in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the interest paid upon war loans during the period from eighteen
hundred and sixty-one to eighteen hundred and sixty-five,
also to fix his compensation which shall be paid out of any
amount received therefrom."
On July 12, 1899, the executive council of the Commonwealth passed a resolution authorizing the attorney general to
employ John B. Cotton to prosecute said claim. Mr. Cotton
was a citizen of the District of Columbia.
Thereupon a form of contract was prepared and executed
by the then Governor of Massachusetts, in behalf and under
the seal of the Commonwealth, and by Cotton; and a duplicate
original thereof was deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.
The prosecution of the claim was at once entered upon,
and after five years was finally adjudicated, audited and
passed.
On or about May 2, 1904, the Treasury Department issued
and delivered to Cotton, as the duly authorized agent of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, war settlement warrant
No. 11343, payable "to the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, or order," for the sum of, $1,611,740.85, and addressed "P. 0. address, c. o. John B. Cotton, agent and att'y,
Washington, D. C."
Mr. Cotton notified the state attorney general of the delivery
of the warrant to him, and that he was entitled to a lien upon
the warrant for the amount of his fees under his contract; and
the Governor was informed to the same effect. Mr. CottonA also
notified the Secretary of the Treasury that he claimed a lien
upon the, warrant for compensation in accordance with his
contract. Subsequently, the Governor, Hon. John L. Bates,
addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury,
in which he demanded that the warrant be cancelled and that
a duplicate thereof be forwarded to him as Governor of the

Commonwealth. The Secretary declined to comply with the
demand. Later Mr. Cotton filed a bill in the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia against "Leslie M. Shaw, Secretairy of the Treasury, and John L. Bates, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," in which he asserted his right
to an attorney's lien upon the papers of his client, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the warrantin question,
and prayed, among other things, that said Leslie M. Shaw
might be restrained and enjoined from cancelling the warrant
which had been delivered to him, and from drawing or issuing
a duplicate thereof to said Bates, and "that the defendant,
John L. Bates, may be restrained and enjoined from asking,
denanding or receiving from the defendant, Leslie M. Shaw,
or any of his assistants, subordinates or clerks, a second or
duplicate warrant as aforesaid."
The State of Massachusetts was not named as a party to this
suit, and no relief was prayed against the State.
Upon the filing of this bill one of the justices of the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia entered a rule on the Secretary of the Treasury, requiring him to show cause why the
relief prayed against him should not be granted, which was
duly served, but has not yet come on for hearing. No process
was served upon defendant Bates, who has since ceased to be
Governor, and he has never appeared in the suit, nor has the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts intervened therein in any
way.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts then filed a petition
in this court, on leave, for writs of prohibition, mandamus
and certiorari, to restrain the justices of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia from taking further proceedings
or entertaining jurisdiction in the equity suit.
In response to a rule entered on that petition, the Chief
Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia showed cause, and submitted, for reasons
set forth, that, as'the case stood, the court ought not to be
prevented from exercising jurisdiction.

Argument for Petitioner.

Mr. Herbert Parker,Attorney General of the State of Massachusetts, and Mr. Frederick IH.Nash for petitioner:
The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia has no
jurisdiction of the bill in equity filed in that court and the
lack of jurisdiction appears on the face of the bill. The only
court where the dispute between Cotton and the Commonwealth can be adjudicated is the Supreme Court of Massachusetts where the Commonwealth has consented to be impleaded.

The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia having no
jurisdiction of the subject matter of the bill, by reason of the
exemption from suit of an indispensable party, the Commonwealth's remedy for the usurpation of jurisdiction is a
writ of prohibition to the judges of that court.
If this suit is removed the Commonwealth can apply for
mandamus to compel the Secretary to issue another warrant.
Redfield v. Windham, 137 U. S. 636; Roberts v. United States,

The Commonwealth should not appear, and none of its
officers can appear, in any court outside of its own jurisdiction.

117 U. S. 52, 71; Georgia v. Jesup, 106 U. S.458; South Carolina v. Wesley, 155 U. S.542.
This court has power to issue the writ of prohibition to the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, that being the
appropriate remedy. In re Vidal, 179 U. S. 126; Ex pdrte
Joins, 191 U. S. 93; Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227;

v. La Crosse R. R. Co., 1 Wall. 405. In every case where the
remedy has been denied there has been a meritorious reason
without dealing with the court's power to issue it. See Asphalt Co. v. Morris, 132 Fed. Rep. 945; act of February 9,
1893, 27 Stat. 434; United States v. Schenz, 102 U. S. 378.
If this court declines to issue a writ of prohibition, then the
petitioner's only remedy is a writ of mandamus to command
the judges of .the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia
to dismiss the suit. Certiorari is desired, if necessary as an

Mr. Frederic D. McKenney and Mr. John D. Flannery,
with whom Mr. William Hitz and Mr. William Frye White
were on the brief, for respondents:
This court has no power to issue the writ of prohibition.

โข132 U. S. 1, 9; Hooe v. Jamieson, 166 U. S. 395.
MR. CHIEF JUsT-Ic FULLER, after making the foregoing
statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
This court has no original jurisdiction over this controversy,
in any view, because it is not a controversy between a State
and a citizen of another State. Hepburn v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch,
445; Hooe v. Jamieson, 166 U. S. 395. And it has not appellate jurisdiction, because since the passage of the act of February 9, 1893, 27 Stat. 434, c. 74, establishing the court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, this court, generally
speaking, and not including cases arising under the bankruptcy
law, Audubon v. Shuteldt, 181 U. S. 575, cannot review the
judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the District,
directly by appeal or writ of error.

Syllabus.

197 U. 8.

By section 716 of the Revised Statutes, this court and the
Circuit and District Courts "have power to issue all writs not
specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for
the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable
to the usages and principles of law."
By section 688, prohibition may issue "in the District
Courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction," but there is no similar provision in respect of
other courts. And it has been repeatedly held, as to the Circuit
Courts, that they have no power under section 716 to issue
writs of prohibition and mandamus, except when necessary
in the exercise of their existing jurisdiction. Bath County v.
Almy, 13 Wall. 244, 248; McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598,
601.
This is equally true of this court, that is to say, that in cases
over which we possess neither original nor appellate jurisdiction we cannot grant prohibition or mandamus or certiorari
as ancillary thereto.
Rule discharged;petition denied.

MATTER OF HEFF.
ORIGINAL.
No. 14. Argued January 9, 10, 1905.-Decided April 10, 90i5.

The recognized relation between the Government and the Indians is that
of a superior and an inferior, whereby the latter is placed under the care
of the former. The Government, however, is under no constitutional
obligation to continue the relationship of guardian and ward and may,
at any time and in the manner that Congress shall determine, abandon
the guardianship and leave the ward to assume and be subject to all the
privileges and burdens of one sui juris.
In construing a statute affecting the relationship of the Government and
the Indians it is not within the power of the courts to overrule the judg-
