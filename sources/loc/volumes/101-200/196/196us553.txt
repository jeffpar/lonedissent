FLANIGAN v. SIERRA COUNTY
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 121. Argued January 12, 1905.-Decided February 20, 1905.

Whether a statute of a State is or is not a revenue measure and how rights
thereunder are affected by a repealing statute depends upon the construction of the statutes, and where no Federal question exists this court
will lean to an agreement with the state court.
Under the California cases the county ordinance imposing licenses involved
in this case was a revenue and not a police measure.
While the doctrine that powers derived wholly from a statute are extinguished by its repeal and no proceedings can be pursued under the repealed statute, although begun before the repeal, unless authorized under
a special clause in the repealing act has been oftenest illustrated in regard
to penal statutes, it has been applied by the California courts to the
repeal of the power of counties to enact revenue ordinances and will
therefore m such a case be applied by this court.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr C C Cole, with whom Mr Joseph C Campbell and Mr
Thomas H. Breeze were on the brief, for petitioner"
The ordinance under which this action was commenced was

repealed by the act of the legislature of the State of California
of March 23, 1901, and hence the action is abated.

The ordinance was obviously enacted solely for raising
revenue. It was not a licensing ordinance. Sonora v Curtin,
137 California, 583, Cooley on Taxation, 573, Mayor v Charlton, 36 Georgia, 460. A license confers a privilege, and makes
-the doing of something legal, which, if done without it, would
be illegal. Insurance Co. v Augusta, 50 Georgia, 530; Burch

The effect of the ordinance is not otherwise than if it had
provided that all sheep owned by those engaged in this business, should be .taxed ten cents a head, that upon the payment
of the tax the owner should be entitled to a tax receipt evidencing such payment, and that if it were not paid, it should
become a debt due the county to be collected by a civil suit.
Calling the tax receipt a "license" and the tax a "license tax'"
does not confine the lawful authority to transact this business
to those who have paid the tax and procured the "license"
any more than an ordinary tax on property creates a right or
authority to own property A license is a police regulation
controlling the exercise of a profession, business or occupation.

The ordinance was passed in the exercise of police power
and for the purpose of regulation, and was not, therefore, repealed. When petitioner commenced to do business in the
county he became-indebted to respondent in the amount due
for the license. The right to the sum due vested in the county,
hence no repeal could affect it. All constitutional questions
raised have been decided adversely to petitioner by the Supreme Court of the State of California. The ordinance was in
the exercise of police power and was not repealed. California

the issue, and, in the absence of a trial, it must appear from the
face of the ordinance that the fee is so excessive that the court
can infer as matter of law that the purpose of the ordinance
.was to raise revenue and not to reimburse the county for the
cost of regulation of the business licensed. Glenn v Mayor,

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

This action was brought by respondent against petitioner
in the Superior Court of the County of Sierra, State of California, and removed on his motion to the United States Circuit Court.
The action was brought to recover the amount of license
ordained under an ordinance passed May 31, 1900, by the
supervisors of the respondent county, under what is known
as "The County Government Act." California Stat. 1897, c.
CCLXXVII. The act gave power to the boards of supervisors of counties as follows:
"To license for regulation and revenue, all and every kind
of business not prohibited by law, and transacted and carried
on in such county, and all shows, exhibitions, and lawful
games carried on therein, to fix the rates of license tax upon
the same, and to provide for the collection of the same, by suit
or otherwise." Sec. 25, subd. 25.
In pursuance of the power conferred the ordinance in controversy was enacted, section 1 of which is as follows:
"Each and every person, copartnership, firm or corporation
engaged in the business of raising, grazing, herding or pasturing sheep in the county of Sierra, State of California, must
annually procure a license therefor from the license collector,
and must pay therefor the sum of ten (10) cents for each sheep
or lamb owned by, in the possession of, or under the control
of such person, copartnership, firm or corporation, and used
in such business in said county"

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinon of the Court.

196 U. S.

Application for a license is required to be made by affidavit,
stating the number of sheep owned by and in possession of the
applicant. "The license tax," it is provided, "shall be deemed
a debt due to the county," which the district attorney of the
county is directed to sue for; and a judgment is authorized.
In case of recovery by the county, $50 damages and costs must
be added to the judgment. All money collected for license,
less a fee of ten per cent for collection, "shall be paid over
to the county treasurer, as other moneys are, and be placed to
the credit of the general funds of the county" Years within
the meaning of the ordinance shall commence on the first day
of January and end on the thirty-first day of December.
The petitioner between the first of May and the twentyfifth of June, 1900, engaged in the business described m the
ordinance, and had in his possession and under his control
25,000 sheep. He failed to apply for a license, and became,
it is alleged, indebted to the county for the sum of $2,500, and
became further indebted to the sum of $50 by way of damages
for his neglect. Payment of both sums was demanded.
Petitioner demurred to the complaint, which, being overruled, and he having declined to answer, judgment was taken
against him. It was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
58 C. C. A. 340.
The ordinance was passed on the thirty-first day of May,
1900, and suit was brought on the twenty-fifth day of June of
that year. On March 23, 1901, by an amendment to the
Political Code of the State of California, section 3366, Stat.
Cal. 1900, 1901, p. 635, the authority of the board of supervisors to license for revenue was repealed. The repealing
provision is as follows:
"Boards of supervisors of the counties of the State, and the
legislative bodies of the incorporated cities and towns therein,
shall, m the exercise of their police powers, and for the purpose
of regulation, as herein provided, and not otherwise, have
power to license all and every kind of business not prohibited
by law, and transacted and carried on within the limits of their

FLANIGA-N v. SIERRA COUNTY

Opmon of the Court.

respective jurisdictions, and all shows, exhibitions and lawful
games carried on therein, to fix the rates of license tax upon the

same, and to provide for the collection of the same by suit or
otherwise."
It is contended that the ordinance imposing the license was
a revenue measure, not a police regulation, and that the law
under which it was enacted, having been repealed, the suit
abated. And, it is also contended, that there was no power to
pass the ordinance. The latter contention is certainly untenable. Ex parte Mirande, 73 California, 365. The former
requires some discussion. There are two parts to it-the
character of the ordinance, as being for revenue or regulation,
and the effect of the repeal of the ordinance. Under the authority of the California cases, it must be regarded as a revenue
measure. 72 California, 387, 73 California, 365, 119 Califorma,
119, Town of Santa Monsca v Gutdinger, 137 California, 658,
City of Sonora v Curt-in, 137 California, 583.
In Merced County v Helm, 102 California 159, the court
said, distinguishing between the taxing power and the police
power, that the latter "is exercised in the enforcement of a
penalty prescribed for a non-compliance with the law, or for
the doing of some prohibited act." It was provided by the
ordinance passed on that the license should be a "debt," payable m advance and to be collected, in case of non-payment
by suit. The absence of regulatory provisions has also been
held to be an element in determining the character of an ordinance. Town of Santa Monica v Guidinger, 70 Pac. Rep. 732.
The ordinance in controversy in the case at bar was, at least,
assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals to be a revenue
measure. This being its character, what was the effect of its
repeal? It withdraws the power of collecting the tax, petitioner contends. The Court of Appeals did not take this view
The court regarded the right of the county as vesting at the
date of the imposition of the license, and that the liability of
petitioner was so far contractual as to be unaffected by the
repeal of the statute giving power to the county to enact the.

196 U. S.

ordinance. We are unable to assent to this view It Is
disputable under the authorities, and it is opposed to the
decisions of the Supreme Court of the State of Califorma.
The general rule is that powers derived wholly from a statute are extinguished by its repeal. Sutherland on Statutory
Construction, § 165. And it follows that no proceedings can
be pursued under the repealed statute, though begun before
the repeal, unless such proceedings be authorized under a
special clause in the repealing act. 9 Bacon's Abridgement,
226. This doctrine is oftenest illustrated in the repeal of penal
provisions of statutes. It has, however, been applied by the
Supreme Court of the State of California to the repeal of the
power of counties to enact ordinances for revenue.
Town of Santa Monsca v Guidinger, 137 California, 658,
was an action for the recovery of $50 for license imposed under
an ordinance of the town "for the licensing of business carried
for purposes of regulation and
on in the town
revenue." The defendant was charged with two license taxes
for $25 each for the year following the date of the ordinance,
that being the annual date established by the ordinance, "for
each person acting as agent or solicitor for any laundry whose
plant or works are located without the corporate limits of the
town." It was held that the license tax was repealed, and the
right of action therefore extinguished, by section 3366 of the
Political Code, added thereto by the act of March 23, 1901.
This is the same section relied upon in the case at bar. The
court said it was clear that the license tax in question was imposed for the purpose of raising revenue, and that the case
was therefore substantially similar to that of City of Sonora v
Curt-n, 137 California, 583. The ordinance involved in the
latter case contained penal provisions, but they manifestly
did not determine the decision. The court observed.
"The right is given by the ordinance to bring a civil suit to
recover the amount so made a license tax. This civil remedy
was created by the ordinance, and the remedy is repealed by
the repeal of the ordinance as to revenue.

FLANIGAfN v. SIERRA COUNTY
196 U. S.

Opunon of the Court.

"In speaking of the rule as to enforcements of rights under
repealed statutes, Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes
[sec. 480], says: 'The same rule aplies to rights and remedies
founded solely upon statute, and to suits pending to enforce
such remedies. If at the time the statute is repealed, the
remedy has not been perfected or the right has not become
vested, but still remains executory, they are gone.' "
It is clear that the decision was not based alone on the penal
character of the ordinance but on the broader principle that
the power to enact it having been taken away the power to
enforce it was also taken away The cases cited by the court
illustrate this. Among others, Napa State Hospitalv Flaherty,
134 California, 315, was cited. In that case the right given
by a statute of the State to maintain an action against the
father of an insane adult son was held to be taken away by the
repeal of the statute conferring the right.
But if the ordinance passed on in City of Sonora v Curtin
was penal, the ordinance involved in the case at bar may be
so characterized within the limits of the principle we are now
discussing, as applied by the Supreme Court of the State of
California. What it might be under broader considerations
see Huntington v Attrill, 146 U S. 657
That there is a conflict between the Supreme Court of the
State and the Circuit Court of Appeals respondent does not
deny Counsel, however, say the conflict "does not arise out
of a construction of a statute of the State," but (we quote the
language of counsel) "as to the effect of the new statute, construed by each court to be a repeal of a prior statute, upon the
rights of the litigant granted under the prior statute, the Circuit Court of Appeals first assuming, but not deciding, that the
ordinance may have been a revenue measure, and the Supreme
Court of California deciding that in its cases the ordinance was
a revenue measure. This question did not involve the construction of the statute, it was merely the determination of a
question that depended upon the principle of general law and
not upon a positive statute of the State." The counsel further

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

]96 U. S.

say- "In such cases the courts of the United States are not
required to follow the decision of state courts." The distinction made by counsel we cannot adopt. Whether a statute of
a State is or is not a revenue measure certainly depends upon
the construction of that statute. Besides, if in any case we
should lean to an agreement with the state court, this is such
a case. There is no Federal right involved. The question is
one strictly of the state law; and the power of one of the
municipalities of the State under that law If we should yield
to the contention of counsel we should give greater power to
one of the municipalities of the State than the law of the State,
as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, would give
it. We should enforce against petitioner a tax which the
Supreme Court of the State, construing a state law, would not
enforce. The result of the contention indicates its error.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings
