foreign vessel from Liverpool arrived at its destination, New York, and
made fast to the wharf. Owing to unusual gales and weather she was
heavily weighted with snow and ice and made top heavy While the

cargo was being unloaded she suddenly rolled over and sank-, damaging
the cargo remaining in her, some of which had been shipped from points
east of Liverpool on bills of lading to Liverpool, thence to be forwarded
to New York, and containing certain exemptions of the carrier from
liability. The owners and insurers of cargo libelled the vessel; it was
found by the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals that the
damage was due to negligence in unloading cargo and ruled that the
negligence fell within section one of the Harter Act and not within section three of the same as negligence in the navigation or management
of the vessel. Held, that:
This court will not go behind the findings of the two courts as to negligence and that the rule was correct.
When a case may fall under section one and section three of the Harter
Act the question which section is to govern must be determined by the
primary nature and object of the acts which cause the loss.
Semble. The standard of conduct is external and not merely co-extensive
with the judgment of the individual.
£rhe Harter Act will be applied to foreign vessels in suits brought in the
United States, and where claimants set up and rely upon the act they
must take the burden with the benefits and cannot claim a greater limitation of liability under provisions of bills of lading.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr Everett P Wheeler for petitioner"
The Harter Act exempts the ship from liability. She was
seaworthy when she left Liverpool and the cargo was in good
order when she arrived in New York. Even if the captain
was negligent his treatment of the ship and cargo was part of
her management under the act. For history of the act see
24 Cong. Rec. 147, 171, 1180.
The exemption under the act continues until the cargo is
delivered from the ship. The Glenochil, Prob. (1896) 10;

Both of the courts below held that the steamer was liable
because a condition of instability brought about by improper

THE GERMANIC.
196 U. S.

Argument for Respondents.

The Harter Act is not a defense, as the damage arose from
causes specified in the first section of the act, Knott v Botany
Mills, 179 U S. 69; S. C., 76 Fed. Rep. 583, and not from
faults or errors of navigation of the vessel within the third
section of the act.
In most of the cases where the Harter Act has been held to
exempt the owner from liability the negligence has not resulted
m any injury to the vessel or affected her safety In many
of them, the negligence has involved peril to the cargo only,
and has consisted solely in the use of the appliances of the
ship, without due regard to the possible effect upon the safety
of the cargo. The Sylvia, 171 U S. 642, The Wildcroft, 130
Fed. Rep. 521, The Rodney (1900), Prob. Div 112, The Mexvcan Prince,82 Fed. Rep. 484, The Sandfield, 82 Fed. Rep. 663,
Rowson v Atlantw Transport Company (1903), K. B. Div 666.
These cases establish that the character of a fault, as a fault in
the management of the ship, or as one for which the owner is
responsible, is not to be determined by the fact that it affects
the ship, or the nature or degree of the effect produced, but by
reference to the nature of the operation which is negligently
performed. The Glenochil, 1896, Prob. Div 10, can be distinguished.
As to where the damage is attributed to unseaworthmess
and not to a fault in her management see The Oneida, 128
Fed. Rep. 687, The Elphwke, 117 Fed. Rep. 272, S. C., 122
Fed. Rep. 439. The tendency is to limit rather than extend
the exemptions under the act. The Delaware, 161 U S. 459;
The Irrawaddy, 171 U S. 187, The Chattahoochee, 173 U S.
540; The Carib Prince, 170 U S. 655. The disaster was not
due to perils of the sea or the act of God. The insurance
clauses of the bills of lading do not relieve the owners.
The provision that the shipowner shall not be liable for
any loss capable of being covered by insurance is invalid. It
is a direct violation of those provisions of the Harter Act
which forbid any clauses relieving the shipowner from the
general responsibility imposed upon him by law

Even before the Harter Act this clause was condemned as

that it practically compelled a shipper to take insurance.

MR.JusTIcE HOLmES delivered the opimon of the court.

This writ of certiorari brings up the record of two cases
which were tried together upon libels filed by cargo owners
and underwriters to recover for water damage done to goods
on board the steamship Germanic. 107 Fed. Rep. 294, 124
Fed. Rep. 1. The steamer reached her pier in New York at
about noon, Saturday, February 11, 1899. She was heavily
coated with ice, estimated by the courts below at not less than
213 tons, and this weight was increased by a heavy fall of snow
after her arrival. She was thirty-six hours late, and in order
to sail at her regular time on the following Wednesday, began
to discharge cargo from all of her five hatches at once. At the
same time she was taking in coal from coal barges on both sides,
to that end being breasted off from the dock twenty-five or
thirty feet on her port side. At about 4 P iu.on Monday,
February 13, she had discharged about 1,370 out of her 1,650
tons of cargo, including all but about 155 tons in the lower hold,
the other 125 tons being on the orlop and steerage decks. She
then had a starboard list of about 80 At that moment she
suddenly rolled over from starboard to port and kept a port
list of 90 or more. As she rolled over the open cover of an aft
coal port, about 33 inches by 22, was knocked off, leaving the
bottom of the coal port about a foot above the water line.

THE GERMANIC.
196 U. S.

Opnion of the Court.

Thereupon the master, who previously had given no attention
to the discharge of cargo and loading of coal, ordered that
coaling should be stopped on the port side but continued on
the starboard, that no more cargo should be taken from the
lower hold, and that some sugar in bags should be shifted to
the starboard side.
When ten tons of sugar had been shifted, at 4.45 P m., the
steamer rolled back to starboard with a list of eight degrees
as before. Coaling was resumed on the port side but at 6 was
stopped on the starboard side. Between 6 and 9 P -i. all her
side pockets were filled with coal up to the main deck, except one
on the starboard, which lacked about thirty tons of being full.
Some twenty or twenty-five tons were run into her cross
bunkers in the lower part of the ship, which previously were
about half full. About fifty tons of goods were discharged
from the orlop and steerage docks, and about sixty tons of
bacon were put on board and distributed evenly in the bottom
of the hold. From 4.45 to 9 the starboard list was increasing
constantly At a little after 9 the steamer suddenly rolled
over again to port, carrying the lower part of the open coal
port below the water line. The pumps could not control the
inflowing water and the ship sank before relief could be got.
The damage to the goods was caused in this way
The petitioner argues that the danger could not have been
foreseen and that there was no negligence, attributing the loss
to an unusual gale and special circumstances. But the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals agree that the
loss was due to hurried and imprudent unloading, which
brought the center of gravity of the ship five or six inches
above the metacenter. As usual we accept their finding. The
Iroquots, 194 U S. 240, 247, The Carib Pnnce, 170 U S. 655,
658. We see no sufficient reason to doubt that it was correct.
With reference to a part of the argument we think it proper
to say a word. It is quite true that negligence must be determined upon the facts as they appeared at the time and not
by a judgment from actual consequences which then were not

to be apprehended by a prudent and competent man. This
principle nowhere has been more fully recognized than by this
court. Lawrence v Minturn, 17 How 100, 110; The Star of
Hope, 9 Wall. 203. But it is a mistake to say, as the petitioner does, that if the man on the spot, even an expert, does
what his judgment approves, he cannot be found negligent.
The standard of conduct, whether left to the jury or laid down
by the court, is an external standard, and takes no account of
the personal equation of the man concerned. The notion that
it "should be coextensive with the judgment of each mdividual," was exploded, if it needed exploding, by Chief Justice Tindal, in Vaughan v Menlove, 3 Bing. N. C. 468, 475.
And since then, at least, there should have been no doubt
about the law Commonwealth v Pierce, 138 Massachusetts,
165, 176. Pollock, Torts, 7th ed., 432.
The foregoing statement, abridged from that of the District
Court, which was accepted by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
is sufficient to present the question which we have to discuss,
if we add the finding of the latter court that after the Germanic
was made fast she was given in charge of the shore agents of
the owners and that they alone assumed direction of the discharging and loading of cargo and prepared her for the return
voyage. The question is whether the damage to the cargo
was "damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel," as was set up in the
answers, in which case the owner was exempted from liability
by § 3 of the Harter Act, or whether it was "loss or damage
arising from negligence, fault, or failure in proper loading,
stowage, custody, care, or proper delivery" of merchandise
under § 1 of the same, in which case he could not stipulate to
be exempt. The second section also recognizes and affirms
the "obligations" "to carefully handle and stow her cargo,
and to care for and properly deliver the same." Act of February 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445.
The petitioner contends that any dealing with the ship or
cargo which affects the fitness of the ship to carry her cargo is

THE GERMANIC.
196 U. S.

"management of the vessel," within the meaning of § 3. To
support this contention the case of The Glenochil [1896], Prob.
10, is cited. There, after the arrival of the vessel in port and
while she was unloading, the engineer, in order to stiffen the
ship, let water into a ballast tank, and did it so negligently
that the water got to and injured the cargo. The damage was
held to result from fault in the management of the vessel
within § 3, and the shipowner was held exempt. See The
Silvia, 171 U S. 462. We see no reason to criticise this decision, and therefore lay on one side at once the fact that the
vessel had come to the end of her voyage and was in dock.
We assume further that the captain retained authority over
his ship, so that it was his power and perhaps his duty to
intervene in any case that needed his control. On these
assumptions the argument is that cargo has also a function
as ballast, that if, for instance, the loss is caused by the inproper shifting of pigs of lead, it does not matter whether they
are called ballast or cargo, but in either case, so far as the
change affects the fitness of the ship as a carrier, it is management of the vessel within the act. The thing done is the same
and the name of the object cannot affect the result.
Nevertheless, in a practical sense, the ship was not under
management at the time, but was the inert ground or floor of
activities that looked not to her, but to getting the cargo
ashore. And this consideration brings to light the limitation
of the section, adopted by the court in The Glenochil, and
sanctioned by this court in Knott v Botany Mills, 179 U S.
69, 73, 74, to faults "primarily connected with the navigation
or the management of the vessel and not with the cargo."
[1896] Prob. 15, 19. In the case supposed the name given
to the pigs of lead is not important in itself, to be sure, but may
indicate a difference in the purpose and character of the
change of place. If the primary purpose is to affect the
ballast of the ship, the change is management of the vessel,
but if, as in view of the findings we must take to have been
the case here, the primary purpose is to get the cargo ashore,

OCTOBER TERMA,

Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

the fact that it also affects the trim of the vessel does not make it
the less a fault of the class which the first section removes from
the operation of the third. We think it plain that a case may
occur which, m different aspects, falls within both sections,
and if this be true, the question which section is to govern
must be determined by the primary nature and object of the
acts which cause the loss.
A distinction was hinted at in argument based on the fact
that the damage was not to the cargo removed, but to that
left behind in the ship. If the damage was attributable to
negligence in unloading, it does not matter what part of the
cargo is injured. The fact referred to does bring out, however, that the negligence in removing the cargo was negligence only because of its probable effect on the ship, and was
negligence towards the remaining cargo, only through its effect
on the ship. But, although this may be conceded, the criterion
which we have given is undisturbed. That "in" which, as the
statute puts it, the fault was shown was not management of the
vessel, but unloading cargo, and, although it was fault only by
reason of its secondary bearing, the primary object determines
the class to which it belongs.
It is settled by repeated decisions that the Harter Act will
be applied to foreign vessels in suits brought in the United
States. The Scotland, 105 U S. 24, The Chattahoochee, 173
U 'S. 540. The claimant sets up the act and relies upon it.
Under the cases it must take the burdens with the benefits,
and no discussion of the terms of the bills of lading, if they
might lead to a greater limitation of liability, is necessary
Knott v Botany Mills, 179 U S.69; The Kenssngton, 183 U. S.
263, 269. Some of the bills of lading in evidence contain a
clause to the further effect that the shipowers, if liable for
a loss capable of being covered by insurance, shall have the
benefit of any insurance on the goods. But these .bills of
lading were for transport to Liverpool, and while they provided for forwarding the goods at ship's expense to New
York, the forwarding was to be on bills of lading issued by

occasion to consider the questions which might be raised if

COULTER v. LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE RAILROAD COMPANY
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.
No. 244. Argued November 29, 30, 1904.-Decided February 20,1905.
A railroad company in Kentucky claimed as its only ground of Federal
jurisdiction in an action in the Circuit Court of the United States against
members of the state board of valuation and assessment that under the
tax laws of the State it was deprived of equal protection of the laws
contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, because while the law of the
State required all property to be taxed at its fair cash value there was
a uniform and general undervaluation of other property but the company's property was taxed at its full value. There was conflicting testimony as to the valuatibns, most of the members of the board testifying
that they tried in good faith to reach fair cash values. Held, that:
The court will not intervene merely on the ground of a mistake in judgment
on the part of the officer to whom the duty of assessment was entrusted
by the law.
It is not beyond the power of a State, so far as the Federal Constitution is
concerned, to tax the franchise of a corporation at a different rate from
the tangible property in the State.
Where the only constitutional ground on which the complainant can come
mto the Circuit Court obviously fails the court should be very cautious
in interfering with the State's administration of its taxes upon other
considerations which would not have given it jurisdiction.

THE facts are stated m the opinion.
