discharge. In effect, the proposition is that it must be assumed as a matter of law, in the absence of a finding to that
effect, that the temporary shore duty was of such a permanent
character as to render it impossible for the officer to continue
to perform duty under his permanent sea assignment, and,
therefore, as a matter of law caused such assignment to terminate. We think the converse is true, and that where the assignment of an officer to duty by the Navy Department
expressly imposed upon him the continued discharge of his
sea duties and qualified the shore duty as merely temporary
and ancillary to the regular sea duty, that the presumption
is that the shore duty was temporary and did not operate to
interfere with or discharge the officer from the responsibilities
of his sea duty to which he was regularly assigned.

THOMPSON v. FAIRBANKS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF VERMONT.

No. 114. Submitted January 6, 1905.-Decided February 20, 1905.
Whether, and to what extent, a chattel mortgage, which includes after
acquired property, is valid is a local and not a Federal question, and in
such a case this court will follow the decisions of the state court.
The enforcement of a lien by the mortgagee taking possession, with the consent of the mortgagor, of after acquired property covered by a valid
mortgage made and recorded prior to the passage of the act, is not a
conveyance or transfer under the bankrupt act; and, where it does not
appear that it was done to hnder, delay or defraud creditors, it does not
constitute a preference under the act although at the time of the enforcement the mortgagee may have known that the mortgagor was insolvent
and considering going into bankruptcy and the petition was filed within
four months thereafter.

THE plaintiff in error, by this writ, seeks to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Vermont m favor
of the defendant in error. 75 Vermont, 361. The facts upon

Statement of the Case.

which the judgment rests are as follows: On the thirtieth
day of June, 1900, Herbert E. Moore, of St. Johnsbury, in the
State of Vermont, filed his voluntary petition in bankruptcy
in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, and on the third day of July, 1900, Moore was by the
court duly adjudged a bankrupt, and on the fifteenth of
September, 1900, the plaintiff m error was appointed a trustee
in bankruptcy of Moore's estate, and duly qualified. He
commenced this action in the County Court of Caledonia
County, in the State of Vermont, on the first Tuesday of June,
1901, against the defendant Fairbanks, to recover from hun
the value of certain personal property alleged to have belonged to the bankrupt Moore on the sixteenth day of May,
1900, and which was, as alleged, sold and converted by Fairbanks, on that day, to his own use, the value of the property
being $1,500, as averred in the declaration. The defendant
filed his plea and gave notice that upon the trial of the case he
would give in evidence and rely upon, in defense of the action,
certain special matters set up in the plea. The case was, by
order of the County Court, and by the consent o the parties,
referred to a referee to hear the cause and report to the court.
It was subsequently heard before the referee, who filed his
report, finding the facts upon which the decision of the case
must rest. He found that before June, 1886, the bankrupt
Moore bought a livery stock and business in St. Johnsbury
village, in the State of Vermont. At the time of this purchase the defendant was the lessor of the buildings in which
the business was conducted, and it continued to be carried
on in those buildings. Moore, in making the purchase, had
assumed a mortgage then outstanding on the property, and a
short time before March 1, 1888, the defendant assisted him
to pay this mortgage by signing a note with hin for $1,425,
payable to the Passumpsic Savings Bank of St. Johnsbury
Subsequently defendant signed notes, which, with accrued
interest, were merged in one dated March 1, 1900, for $2,510.75,
due on demand to said savings bank signed by the bankrupt

and by the defendant as his surety This note had not been
paid when the case was referred to the referee. The defendant also signed other notes payable to the First National Bank
of St. Johnsbury, which were merged into one, and by various
payments made by Moore, it was reduced to $525, and on
June 4, 1900, it was paid by the defendant. All these notes
had been signed by the defendant to assist Moore in carrying
on, building up and equipping his livery stable and livery
business, and as between them the notes belonged to Moore
to pay On April 15, 1891, Moore gave the defendant a
chattel mortgage on the livery property to secure him for
these and other debts and liabilities. The property was described in the mortgage as follows: "All my livery property,
consisting of horses, wagons, sleighs, vehicles, harnesses, robes,
blankets, etc., also all horses and other livery property that I
may purchase in my business or acquire by exchange."
The condition contained in the mortgage was, that if Moore
should "well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, to the said
Henry Fairbanks all that I now owe him, or may owe him
hereafter by note, book account, or in any other manner, and
shall well and truly save the said Henry Fairbanks harmless,
and indemnify him from paying any commercial -paper on
which he has become or may hereafter become holden in any
manner for my benefit as surety, indorser or otherwise, then
this deed shall.be void, otherwise of force."
This mortgage was acknowledged and the affidavit as provided by the Vermont statute was appended, showing the
justice of the debt and the liability contemplated to be secured
by the mortgage, and the mortgage was duly recorded on the
eighteenth day of April, 1891, in the St. Johnsbury clerk's
office by the town clerk thereof. On March 5, 1900, Moore
gave the defendant another chattel mortgage on this livery
stock, which, on March 23, 1900, defendant assigned to the
Passumpsic Savings Bank, and that bank has ever since been
its holder and owner. This mortgage was given to secure
defendant against all his liabilities for Moore.

THOMPSON v. FAIRBANKS.
196 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

On the seventh of May, 1900, one John Ryan sued out a
writ in assumpsit against Moore to recover some $500, and an
attachment on the livery stock was levied in that suit by the
deputy sheriff. This attachment remained m force until dissolved by the bankruptcy proceedings, and the suit is still
pending m the state court of Vermont.
Under the agreement contained m the chattel mortgage of
Apri1_o1891, Moore made sales, purchases and exchanges of
livery stock to such an extent that on March459i_1, there
only remained of the livery property on hand April 15, 1891,
two horses. These sales, exchanges and purchases were some-.
t
made by Moore without communication with or advice
from the defendant, and frequently after consultation with
him. The livery stock, as it existed on May 16, 1900 was all
stock or with the avails
acq red by exchagmal
of the old stock or from the money derived from the business.
Some years after the execution of the chattel mortgage of
April 15, 1891, Moore became embarrassed, and finally, shortly
prior to March 5, 1900, he became and continued wholly insolvent. On May 16, 1900, the defendant, acting under the
advice of counsel, and with the consent of Moore, took possession under the mortgage of April 15, 1891, of all the livery
property then on hand, and on June 11, 1900, caused the same
to be sold at public auction by the sheriff. It is for the net
avails of this sale, amounting to $922.08, which the sheriff
paid over to the defendant, that this suit is brought. The
Passumpsic Savings Bank on September 15, 1900, proved its
note of $2,510.75 as an unsecured claim against the bankrupt
estate of Moore, as the mortgage held by the bank as security
had been given by Moore in March, 1900, to _d~fen4at, and
by him assigned to the bank, within four months of the filing
of the petition in bankruptcy
For the purpose of defeating the effect of the defendant
taking possession of the livery property under his chattel
mortgage of April, 1891, the trustee in bankruptcy presented
a petition to the United States District Court of Vermont for

leave to intervene as plaintiff in the Ryan attachment suit,
and to have the lien of Ryan's attachment preserved for the
benefit of the general creditors. This petition was dismissed
by that court. The referee found that the defendant and his
counsel knew when he took possession of the livery property,
under his mortgage, that Moore was insolvent and was considering going into bankruptcy The referee also found that
he did not intend to perpetrate any actual fraud on the other
creditors, or any of them, but he did intend thereby to perfect
his lien on the livery property and make it available for the
.payment of his debt before other complications, by way of
attachment or bankruptcy arose, and he understood at that
time that it was probable that the Ryan attachment would
hold good as against his mortgage. All the property of which
defendant took possession was acquired by Moore with the
full understanding and intent that it should be covered by the
defendant's mortgage of April 15, 1891.

MR. JusTIcE PECKimA, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a contest between a trustee in bankruptcy representing the creditors of the bankrupt, and the defendant, the
mortgagee in a chattel mortgage dated and executed April 15,
1891, and duly recorded April 18 of that year. The defendant has paid some $500 of the indebtedness of the bankrupt
for which defendant was liable as endorser on a note, and he
remains liable to pay the note of $2,510.75, held by the Passumpsic Savings Bank, which was signed by him as surety
The property taken possession of by the defendant under
the chattel mortgage was sold by a deputy sheriff on the

eleventh of June, 1900, and the net avails of the sale, amountmg to $922.08, have been paid over by the officer who made
the sale, to the defendant.
This suit is brought by the trustee to recover from the defendant those net avails on the theory that the action of the
defendant in taking possession and making the sale of the
property was unlawful under the provisions of the bankrupt
act.
The defendant had assisted the bankrupt in the purchase
of the property and had endorsed notes for hun in order to
enable him to carry on the business of conducting a livery
stable. This mortgage, to secure him for these payments and
liabilities, was given some seven years before the passage of
the bankrupt act, and at the time it was given it was agreed
by the parties to it that the bankrupt might sell or exchange
any of the livery stock covered by it as he might desire, and
should by purchase or exchange keep the stock good, so that
the defendant's security should not be unpaired, and it was
also agreed that all after-acquired livery property should be
covered by the mortgage as security for the debts specified
therein.
Under this agreement the bankrupt made sales, purchases
and exchanges of livery stock to such an extent that on May 16,
1900, there remained but two horses of the property originally
on hand. The stock as it existed on the above date was all
acquired by exchange of the original stock, or with the avails
of the old stock sold, or the money derived from the business.
There is no pretense of any actual fraud being committed or
contemplated by either party to the mortgage. Instead of
taking possession at the time of the execution of the mortgage,
the defendant had it recorded in the proper clerk's office, and
the record stood as notice to all the world of the existence of
the lien as it stood when the mortgage was executed, and that
the defendant would have the right to take possession of
property subsequently acquired as provided for in the mortgage. The bankrupt was, therefore, not holding himself out

Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

as unconditional owner of the property, and there was no securing of credit by reason of his apparent unconditional ownership. The record gave notice that he was not such unconditional owner. There was no secret lien, and if defendant
cannot secure the benefit of this mortgage, which he obtained
in 1891, as a lien upon the after-acquired property, yet prior
to the title of the trustee for the benefit of creditors, it must
be because of some provision of the bankruptcy law, which
we think the court ought not to construe or endeavor to enforce beyond its fair meaning.
In Vermont it is held that a mortgage, such as the one in
question, is good. The Supreme Court of that State has so
held in this case, and the authorities to that effect are also
cited m the opinion of that court. And it is also there held
that when the mortgagee takes possession of after-acquired
property, as provided for in this mortgage, the lien is good
and valid as against every one but attaching or judgment
creditors prior to the taking of such possession.
At the time when the defendant took possession of this
after-acquired property, covered by the mortgage, there had
been a breach of the condition specified therein, and the title
to the property was thereby vested in the mortgagee, subject
to the mortgagor's right in equity to redeem. This has been
held to be the law in Vermont (aside from any question as to
the effect of the bankrupt law), both in this case and m the
cases also cited in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Vermont. The taking of possession of the after-acquired property, under a mortgage such as this, is held good, and to relate
back to the date of the mortgage, even as against an assignee
in insolvency Peabody v Landon, 61 Vermont, 318, and
other cases cited in the opinion of the Supreme Court.
Whether and to what extent a mortgage of this kind is
valid, is a local question, and the decisions of the state court
will be followed by this court in such case. Dooley v Pease,
180 U S. 126.

The question that-remains is, whether the taking of posses-

Opinion of the Court.

sion after condition broken, of these mortgaged chattels before, and wthin- Tour months of-filing the petition in bankruptcy, was a violation of any of the provisions of the bank-

rupt act?
The trustee insists that such taking possession of the afteracquired property, under the mortgage of 1891, constituted
a preference under that act. He contends that the defendant
did not have a valid lien against creditors, under that act,
that his lien might under other circumstances have been consummated by the taking of possession, but as that was done
within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy,
the lien was not valid.
Did this taking of possession constitute a preference within
the meaning of the act?
It was found by the referee that when the defendant took
possession of the property he knew that the mortgagor was
insolvent and was considering going into bankruptcy, but that
he did not intend to perpetrate any actual fraud on the other
creditors, or any of them, but did intend thereby to perfect
his lien on the property, and make it available for the payment
of his debts before other complications, by way of attachment
or bankruptcy arose. He then understood that Ryan's attachment would probably hold good against his mortgage.
The question whether any conveyance, etc., was in fact made
with intent to defraud creditors, when passed upon in the
state court, is not one of a Federal nature. McKenna v
Simpson, 129 U S. 506, Cramer v Wilson, 195 U S. 408. It
can scarcely be said that the enforcement of a lien by the
taking possession, with the consent of the mortgagor, of
after-acquired property covered by a valid mortgage is a
conveyance or transfer within the bankrupt act. There is no
finding that in parting with the possession of the property the
mortgagor had any purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding his creditors, or any of them. Without a finding to
the effect that there was an intent to defraud, there was no
invalid transfer of the property within the provisions of sec-

tion 67e of the bankruptcy law Sabrn v Camp, 98 Fed. Rep.
974.
In the case last cited the court, upon the subject of a preference, held that though the transaction was consummated
within the four months, yet it originated in October, 1897,
and there was no preference under the facts of that case.
"What was done was in pursuance of the pre6xisting contract,
to which no objection is made. Camp furnished the money
out of which the property, which is the subject of the sale to
him, was created. He had good right, in equity and in law,
to make provision for the security of the money so advanced,
and the property purchased by his money is a legitimate
security, and one frequently employed. There is always a
strong equity in favor of a lien by one who advances money
upon the property which is the product of the money so advanced. This was what the parties intended at the time, and
to this, as already stated, there is, and can be, no objection in
law or in morals. And when, at a later date, but still prior to
the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, Camp exercised his
rights under this valid and equitable arrangement to possess
himself of the property and make sale of it in pursuance of his
contract, he was not guilty of securing a preference under the
bankruptcy law"
The principle that the taking possession may sometimes be
held to relate back to the time when the right so to do was
created, is recognized in the above case. So in this case, although there was no actual existing lien upon this afteracquired property until the taking of possession, yet there
was a positive agreement, as contained in the mortgage and
existing of record, under which the inchoate lien might be
asserted and enforced, and when enforced by the taking of
possession, that possession under the facts of this case, related
back to the time of the execution of the mortgage of April,
1891, as it was only by virtue of that mortgage that possession
could be taken. The Supreme Court of Vermont has held that
such a mortgage gives an existing lien by contract, which may

THOMPSON v. FAIRBANKS.
196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

be enforced by the actual taking of possession, and such lien can
only be avoided by an execution or attachment creditor, whose
lien actually attaches before the taking of possession by the
mortgagee. Although this after-acquired property was subject
to the lien of an attaching or an execution creditor, if perfected
before the mortgagee took possession under his mortgage, yet
if there were no such creditor, the enforcement of the lien by
taking possession would be legal, even if within the fourmonths provided in the act. There is a distinction between,
thetbald 'creation of a lien within the four months, and the
enforcement of one provided for in a mortgage executed yearsi
before the passage of the act, by virtue of which mortgage and
because of the condition broken, the title to the property becomes vested in the mortgagee, and the subsequent taking
possession becomes valid, except as above stated. A trustee
in bankruptcy does not in such circumstances occupy the same
position as a creditor levying under an execution, or by attachment, and his rights, in this exceptional case, and for the
reasons just indicated, are somewhat different from what they
are generally stated. Mueller v Nugent, 184 U S. 1.
It is admitted on the part of the counsel for the plaintiff in
error that the rule in Vermont, in cases of chattel mortgages of
after-acquired property (where possession by the mortgagee
is necessary to perfect his title as against attaching or execution creditors), is that although such possession be not taken
until long after the execution of the mortgage, yet the possession, when taken (if it be before the lien of the attaching or
execution creditor), brings the property under the cover and
operation of the mortgage as of its date-the time when the
right of possession was first acquired. It was also admitted
that the Supreme Court of Vermont has held that when a
chattel mortgage requiring possession of the mortgaged property, to perfect it as to third persons, was executed more than
four months before the commencement of insolvency proceedings, the taking of actual possession of the mortgaged
property within the four months' period brought that prop-

erty under the mortgage as of its date, and so did not constitute
a preference voidable by the trustee, although the other elements constituting a preference were present. Many decisions
of the Supreme Court of Vermont are cited to this effect. It
will be observed, also, that the provisions of the state msolvency law in regard to void and voidable preferences and transfers were identical with similar provisions of the bankruptcy
act of 1867 Gilbert v Vail, 60 Vermont, 261.
Under that law it was held that the assignee m bankruptcy
stood m the shoes of the bankrupt, and that "except where,
within a prescribed period before the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy, an attachment has been sued out
against the property of the bankrupt, or where his disposition
of his property was, under the statute, fraudulent and void,
his assignees take his real and personal estate, subject to all
equities, liens and encumbrances thereon, whether created by
his act or by operation of law" Yeatman v Savongs Instituton, 95 U S. 764. See also Stewart v Platt, 101 U. S. 731,
Hauselt v. Harrsson,105 U S. 401. Under the present bankrupt act, the trustee takes the property, of the bankrupt, m
cases unaffected by fraud, in the same' plight and condition
that the bankrupt himself held it, and subject to all the
equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt,
except m cases where there has been a conveyance or encumbrance of the property which is void as against the trustee
by some positive provision of the act. In re Garcewnch, 115
Fed. Rep. 87, 89, and cases cited.
It is true that in the case in 95 U S. 764, the savings institution had a special property in the certificates which were the
subject of dispute, and had possession of them at the time of
the bankruptcy proceedings, and it was held that the institution was not bound to return them, either to the bankrupt, the
receiver or the assignee m bankruptcy, prior to the time of the
payment of the debt for which the certificate was held. So the
state court held m this case, where the defendant took possession under the circumstances detailed, by virtue of his mort-

gage, and where he had the legal title- to the property mortgaged, after condition broken, that the possession thus taken
related back to the date of the giving of the mortgage, and in
thus enforcing his lien there was not a violation of any of the
provisions of the bankruptcy act.
In Wilson v Nelson, 183 U S. 191, it was held that the
bankrupt had committed an act of bankruptcy, within the
meaning of the bankrupt law, by failing, for at least five days
before a sale on the execution issued upon the judgment recovered, to vacate or discharge the judgment, or to file a
voluntary petition m bankruptcy The judgment and execution were held to have been such a preference, "suffered or
permitted" by the bankrupt, as to amount to a violation of
the bankrupt act. Although the judgment was entered upon
the power of attorney given years before the passage of the
bankrupt act, it was nevertheless regarded as "suffering or
permitting" a preference, within that act. This is not such a
case. As we have said, there is no finding that the defendant
had reasonable cause to believe that by the change of possession it was intended to give a preference. As the state court
has said, it was rather a recognition of what was regarded as
a right under the previous agreement contained in the mortgage.
Nor does the existence of the Ryan attachment, or the chattel
mortgage of March 5, 1900, executed by the bankrupt and delivered to the defendant and by him assigned on the twentythird of March, 1900, to the bank, create any greater right or
title in the trustee than he otherwise would have. The trustee
moved under section 67f, on notice to the defendant, for an
order that the right or lien under the Ryan attachment should
be preserved, so that the same might pass to the trustee for
the benefit of the estate, as provided for in that section. This
was denied. And unless such permission had been granted,
the lien of the attachment was not preserved by the act, but,
on the contrary, it was dissolved under-section 67c.
The mortgage assigned to the bank, and the attachment

obtained by Ryan having been dissolved by the bankrupt
proceedings, the defendant's rights under his mortgage of
April 15, 1891, stood the same as though there had been no
subsequent mortgage given, or attachment levied. This is the
view taken by the state court of the effect of the dissolution
of the mortgage and attachment liens under the bankrupt act,
and we think it is the correct one. It is stated m the opinion
of the state court as follows:
"It is urged that with the annulment of the attachment,
the property affected by it passed to the trustee as a part of the
estate of the bankrupt under the express provisions of section 67f There would be more force in this contention were
it not for the provision that, by order of the court, an attachment lien may be preserved for the benefit of the estate. If
there is no other lien on the property, there can be no occasion
for such order; for on the dissolution of the attachment, the
property, unless exempt, would pass to the trustee anyway
It is only when the property for some reason may not otherwise pass to the trustee as a part of the estate that such order
is necessary We think such is the purpose of that provision,
and that unless the lien is preserved, the property, as in the
case at bar, may be held upon some other lien and not pass
to the trustee. In re Sentenne & Green Co., 120 Fed. Rep.
436."
We think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Vermont
was right, and it is
Affirmed.
