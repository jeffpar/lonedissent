OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Syllabus.

Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the Circuit Court should
have determined, by its final decree, what rights those defendants have by virtue of the above act of March 3, 1887, 24
Stat. 556, c. 376, in the lands or any of them now in dispute
and claimed by the United States. The effect of the decree
is to leave undetermined the question whether the defendants
who claim under the Southern Pacific Railroad Company are
protected by that or any other act of Congress. The Government was entitled to a decree quieting its title to all the lands
described in its pleadings, except those, if any, that are protected, in the hands of claimants, by acts of Congress.
United States v. Winona & St. Peter Railroad, 165 U. S.
463; Winona & St. Peter Railroad v. United States, 165
U. S.483. But as the Government has not appealed, the
decree cannot be reversed for the error of the Circuit Court in
not finally disposing of the issues between the United States
and the individual defendants who claim under the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company.
The result isthat the decree must be affirmed in all respects
as to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, as well
as to the trustees in the mortgage executed by that com.pany,and affirmed also as to the other defendants, subject,
however, to the right of the Government to proceed in the
Circuit Court to a final decree as to those defendants, and
it is so ordered.

Held,

(1) That no grant was made until return should be made by the alcalde,
and that, until his action should be approved by the governor, it
was without effect;
(2) That as there was no evidence in this case, either in the papers presented in support of the pttitioner's claim, or in the facts and circumstances proved, from which an approval could properly be
presumed, the petitioner must be held to have failed in a material
part of her case;
(3) That in consequence of such failure, the petitioner was not entitled
to judgment for eleven square leagues of the land claimed, under

MRi. JUSTICE PEOKHAm delivered the opinion of the court.
These are cross-appeals from a judgment of the Court of
Private Land Claims, confirming in the petitioner Bergere,
for herself and. the other heirs of Manuel Antonio Otero and
Miguel. Antonio Otero, the title to eleven square leagues of
land in the Territory of New Mexico. The petition was filed
in the court below, asking that the validity of the title to a
very much larger tract of land in the above territory, alleged
to have been granted in 1819 to one Bartolom6 Baca by acting Governor Melgares, might be confirmed to the heirs and
legal representatives of Baca, of whom, she alleged, she was
one.
The number of acres contained in the alleged grants was
not stated; but it has been variously estimated at from half a
million to a million and a half.
The judgment of confirmation was granted upon the ground,
as stated by the court, that the grant to Baca was imperfect
at the time of the cession of the department of New Mexico

Opinion of the Court.

to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and
hence it could only be confirmed by the court for'the amount
of eleven square leagues, under the seventh subdivision of
section thirteen of the act of Congress of March 3, 1891,
c. 539, 26 Stat. 851, 860, creating the' Court of Private Land
Claims. That subdivision reads as follows:
"No confirmation in respect of any claims or lands mentioned in section six of this act, or in respect of any claim or
title that was not complete and perfect at the time of the
transfer of sovereignty to the United States as referred to, in
this act, shall in any case be made or patent issued for a
greater quantity than eleven square leagues of land to or in
the right of any one original grantee or claimant, or in the
right of any one original grant .to two or more persons jointly,
nor for a greater quantity than was authorized by the respective laws of Spain or Mexico applicable to the claim."
The petitioner thought the court below should have confirmed her title to .the whole of the land described in the
alleged grant, while the counsel for the Government was of
the opinion that the judgment ought not to have confirmed
her title to any portion thereof. Both parties have therefore
appealed from the judgment to this court.
In the course of the trial certain papers were put in evidence
on the part of the petitioner, for the purpose of proviig the
alleged grant. They were written in the Spanish language,
and a sworn translation thereof, also appearing in the record,
reads as follows:

Opinion of the Court.

"In execution of the decree of July, 2, 1819, I, Jose Garcia
de la Mora, the judge commissioned b. Lieutenant Colonel
Facundo Melgares, govern6r of the 1rbvince of New Mexico,
proceeded in company. with captain. of volunteer militia, Bartolom6 Baca, who by his merits and conduct in the service of
both majesties, as has been proved by the offices which have
been conferred upon him of alcalde mayor, and in other services in the field, the governors always appointing him commander of campaigns and scouting parties, which he always
led with honor and valor, and in addition to all this he has
always surpassed others in voluntary contributions, setting a
good example to his inferiors. Wherefore, in reward of all
these merits and services I have proceeded in his company to
examine the tract he applies for, and knowing that it is wild
land, and that no injury results to any third party, I have
placed him in possession in the name of the King (whom may
God preserve), and I took him by the hand and led'him over
the whole tract, he shouting and plucking up grass and throwing stones in the name of the King, saying, 'Long live our
beloved monarch, Don Fernando VII., whom God may preserve,' with hurrahs and shouts, and I shed tears of delight
at his acclamations; and I designated to him for his boundaries: On the south, the Ojo del Guervo, following its line to
the Ojo del Chico; on the east, the Cerro del Pedernal; on the
north, the Ojo del Cibolo; on the west, the Altura de la Sierra

that his herds may be maintained, to which he is bound,
transmitting the whole for your approval, he --wil satisfy the

The petitioner claims that the evidence shows an approval
by the governor of the action of the alcalde in delivering
juridical possession of the land described in the petition of
Baca, and that thereby the grant became effective and- absolute. Also that there is sufficient evidence of an adverse possession of such land by Baca from 1819 to the time of his
death in 1834 and after that time by his heirs and representatives.
The court below found the following facts:
"First. That on February 4, 1819, Bartolom.6 Baca presented a petition to the then governor of the province of
New Mexico, Facundo Melgares, setting forth that he had
registered a piece of vacant land which was called the Torreon; that the said governor made the said grant as petitioned for on July 2, 1819, and directed Jos6 Garcia de la
Mora to give possession, designating the limits and officiating
duly; that afterwards, to wit, on September 12, 1819, the

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

said official gave to the said Bartolom6 Baca the actual
possession of the said tract of land, called the Torreon, petitioned for.
"Second. That the said tract of land, called the Torreon,
had been in the actual possession of Bartolom6 Baca for more
than four years from the date of the grant on said September
12, 1819.
"Third. That the said petitioner, who filed her petition for
herselfiand other heirs of Manuel Antonio Otero and Miguel
Antonio Otero, are the legal successors in interest to the
rights of the said heirs of the said Bartolom6 Baca.
"The court finds as a matter of law that the grant to said
Bartolom6 Baca was imperfect at the time of the cession of
the department of New Mexico to the United States of America by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and that the petitioner for herself and other .heirs of Manuel Antonio Otero
and Miguel Antonio Otero, as the legal representatives of the
said Bartolom6 Baca, is entitled to a confirmation of eleven
square leagues of land within the outboundaries of the tract
of land, called the Torreon, granted to said Baca, and of
which he .was put in actual possession.
"It is therefore 6rdered, adjudged and decreed by this
court that the claim of the petitioner for the land hereinbefore described and set out be, :and the same is hereby,
confirmed to the extent of eleven square leagues to the heirs
and legal representatives of Bartolom6'Baca, provided that
this confirmation shall not confer any right or title to any
gold, silver or quicksilver, mines or minerals of the saie."
In regard to the character of the grant involved in this proceeding, it is conceded on the part of counsel for petitioner
that the approval of the governor was necessary in order to
make the grant effective. In their brief they say: 1" Now this
grant was not finally made until return was made by the alcalde and approval had. Before that time it had no existence. The confirmation of the government was the one act
that fixed the right, of the grantee, and that final act was
based upon the return and, necessarily in this case, in confirmation of the return."

BERGERE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

We have no doubt of the correctness of this view. The
governor, in his reference of the case to the alcalde, bids him
transmit the expediente to his office, 8o that if approved the
proper testimonio may be ordered to be given the petitioner.
Until approved, the action of the alcalde was of no effect.
The burden of showing this approval rested with the petitioner, and unless she has sustained it she has failed in this
branch of her case.

In speaking of the burden cast upon a petitioner who asks
confirmation of an alleged grant of land under the act of
1891, above referred to, this court, in Whitney v. United
State8, 167 U. S. 529, at page 517, said: "Upon the whole, we
have come to the conclusion that the claimants have not made
out their case by a fair preponderance of evidence or such
weight of testimony as is necessary to establish their title
to this large tract of land."
Counsel for the petitioner claim that, assuming the burden
as above stated, there is a presumption, arising from an inspection of these papers and-from a consideration of the other
evidence in the case, that there was an approval of the action
of the alcalde by the governor, and that the grant was thus
made effective. We do not concur in this view, and we are of
opinion that the papers themselves show no approval by the
governor, and that there is no evidence of other facts or circumstances from which such approval could properly be presumed.
There is no approval to be found upon the papers themselves. This is too plain for argument. The torn portion of
the paper following the report of the alcalde has no word of
approval theteon. There is part of a sentence which, as translated, means "the boundaries by," and under it is the signature of Melgares, with the exception that the first letter of
his name is lacking. This does not and cannot in and of itself
constitute an approval in fact, and there must be something
more than this torn paper upon which to found a presumption
of such approval.
It is, however, urged that the presumption arises from an,
inspection of all the papers above referred to, aided by a consideration of the other evidence in the case.

74:

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

We think no such presumption can be indulged in from an
inspection of all of the papers in question even when aided by
the other evidence.
Such an inspection shows that the alcalde proceeded on his
own account to deliver juridical possession of a much larger
tract of- land than Baca had petitioned for in his petition to
the governor. This largdr tract the alcalde described in his
report to the governor, and submitted his action to the governor for his final approval.
The action of the alcalde is sufficient to prevent a presumption of approval founded solely on an inspection of the papers.
The difference between the amount of the land asked for and
that delivered by the alcalde is too great to permit of any
presumption of approval. There must be some proof of it:
We are not aided in making this presumption by a consideration of the other evidence.
Counsel for the petitioner refer to. the fact of the possession
of these papers by Baca as an important piece of evidence
in aid of this presumption. The possession alluded to was
proved by one of the grandsons of Baca, who was a witness
He testified that his mother was a
for the petitioner.
daughter of Baca, and that his father was Baca's administrator. The papers of Baca were in the possession of his
father as such administrator.. His: father died somewhere
about 1880, and after his death the witness took the box of
papers that had belonged, as he said, to his grandfather and
kept it. He did not know its contents until he was looking
for some papers belonging to his father, when he found what
he describes as a part of the grant of a tract to Bartolom6
Baca. Witness took the paper to Manuel Antonia Otero,
who said: ".Let us search f6r the other part, and I will buy
it from you and the other heirs "; and then after a further
search the other part was found, and these papers thus found
are the ones above set forth.
Upon these facts it is said that it appears that the papers
were in possession of Baca, and that they were delivered to
him by or on behalf of the governor, and it therefore follows
that the grant was approved, by him, or otherwise the papers

BERGERE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

would not have been delivered. The bare fact of possession
of the papers as above stated is all that the evidence shows.
There is not one word of proof of any delivery of the papers
to Baca, and we cannot see, from the mere fact of possession
of the papers under these circumstances, sufficient ground
upon which to base a presumption of delivery, and therefore
of approval.
We are asked to presume the fact of delivery because the
papers were found in the box of papers once belonging to
Baca, and we are then further asked to presume an approval
because of the presumed delivery. This requires an entirely
too free use of presumptions unsupported by evidence tending
in the direction of proof of the facts to be presumed. If the
papers had contained an approval by the governor, it might
perhaps have been admissible to presume a delivery from the
fact of possession. It is too much to ask us to presume both
facts from the sole fact of the possession of the papers. The
other evidence in the case, viewed in connection with these
facts, is wholly insufficient to permit of the presumption. It
is directed only to the fact of possession of the land by Baca;
the character and weight of which evidence will be spoken of
hereafter. It is enough to say here that it is insufficient to be
used as lending any strength to the presumption of approval
which we are at present discussing.
In the condition-in which the papers were found, some evidence further than mere possession of them should have been
given. The papers were not found together or at the same
time. They were torn, and part of the name of the governor
had disappeared; they were not of a character to be probably
found in the hands of Baca. The proof as.to the manner in
which Spanish grants were evidenced, as ascertained from an
examination of the records in the surveyor general's office in
the Territory, is unimportant. The witness was simply unable
to give an opinion as to the general custom. Here,- however,
the papers themselves showed that something othdr than
those papers was to be given the grantee. The papers
formed the expediente and belonged in the archives of the
government when approved, and they show on their face that

OCTOBER TERMI!, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

if the government approved, there was to be given in that
case a proper testimonio to the petitioner, which it was evidently contemplated should be something other than this expediente. There is no proof of the existence of any such
paper or that it was ever given.
Under all these circumstances, some explanation as to the
possession of these papers by Baca should have been given,
showing they were intended as in place of the testimonio, so
that the presumption of a delivery and an approval by reason
thereof would not necessarily rest solely upon the fact that
the papers without any approval endorsed on the return were
found as stated.
Evidence of the delivery of juridical possession of the land
to Baca is also referred to as aiding the presumption of the
subsequent approval by the governor and the deliveryof the
papers to Baca, and the further alleged fact of the retention
of such possession by Baca up to his death in 1834, is also
mentioned for the purpose of strengthening this presumption.
The alcalde in fact delivered to Baca juridical possession of
much more land than was asked for by Baca in his petition.
This fact is attempted to be explained upon the theory that
the petition of Baca did not describe in detail the land he
asked for, and that the governor in referring the petition to
the alcalde directed him to designate the limits, and do -what
was proper, etc. There is, however, a sufficient description of
the land contained in the petition of Baca. It was in regard
to that particular land thus described that the acting governor
said that "as he asks it according to law," etc., "Don Mora
will proceed to give the possession, designating the limits."
Was this an authority to Don Mora to designate such limits
as might seem good to him, or was -it simply an authority to
designate those lirhits which were described in the petition of
Baca? We have no doubt it was the latter, and hence when
the alcalde made return that he had delivered juridical possession'of a much larger tract of land than had been asked
for, it would naturally be.supposed there might be hesitation
and refusal to approve on the part of the governor. Certainly, no presumption of approval would arise from these

BERGERE v. UNITED STATES.

77

Opinion of the Court.

facts. Therefore the delivery of juridical possession, as
shown in this case, has not the usual importance that is
attached thereto when such delivery takes place as the concluding act in a grant of an absolute character. This delivery was concededly conditional, and could have no final effect
until the approval by the governor, and this approval must be
shown by the petitioner to have been given, and cannot be
presumed to follow the delivery of juridical possession.
Actual possession of the land described in the alleged grant
for four years by Baca, as found by the court below, is also
claimed as an important fact upon which, in addition to the
evidence already alluded to, the presumption of approval
may properly be sustained. The evidence upon which the
finding is based is not substantially contradicted, and it shows
that after the delivery of jutidical possession by the alcalde,
Baca built some small buildings on a portion of the land, for
the use of his herders and servants, who occupied them, and
who were attending to the business of looking after his
horned cattle, sheep and horses, for which Baca wanted
pasture. He never himself resided on the land, but subsequently to his taking possession from the alcalde and at
different times prior to his death in 1834, other persons,
embracing in all a number of families, had come upon Baca's
portion of the land, and had dwelt there, without any molestation from him, and probably with his consent, on account
of the protection their presence would afford to his interests
against the Indians. During the years subsequefit to the
grant in question there were granted within the boundaries
thereof small grants to settlements or towns, which the petitioner says were granted with the assent of Baca and his
legal representatives. There is also evidence of some small
attempts at cultivation within a narrow range of land contained'in the grant, hardly enough to speak of. Some of
the witnesses for the petitioner said the place was called
* Torreon because Baca built a torreon there, and the people
gave it that name for that reason. The accuracy of this evidence becomes doubtful, to say the least, when, by referring
to the original application of Baca to the acting governor for

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Couit..

the grant, he describes it therein as "a vacant
tract called the Torreon, and which extends," etc., as described.
Two of the sons of Baca occupied at one time a log house
that was built by Baca upon the land, and they occupied it
while superintending the herders who were caring for the
cattle being pastured in the vicinity. Petitioner's witnesses
also said that since 1819 and up to the death of Baca, he was
recognized as the owner of the property, and after his death
the property was recognized and respected as that of Baca.
Who were the persons thus recognizing ownership is not
stated, whether servants and agents of Baca, or independent
third persons. Some of the witnesses making these statements
were wholly ignorant, as they said, of the fact that grants of
portions of this land had been made by the Mexican government as vacant and unoccupied lands. Subsequently to the
date of 1819 such conveyances were in fact made; and
whether the title conveyed by them was good or bad, it
appears conclusively that the Mexican government, during
the time when this possession of Baca is claimed to have been
in existence,- regarded the tract as vacant and unoccupied so
far as to permit of its conveyance to others of various portions
of the land now claimbd. Another witness thought that Baca
occupied about three hundred varas in width from east to
west and from north to south, but he was ignorant as to the
boundaries of the grant, although so far as he knew Baca
claimed no more than three hundred varas, and this was
under sonie cultivation for a distance of about one hundred
varas from north to south, and this was as late as 1829 or
1830. Other persons during this time came in and made
application to the judge of first instance, as witness remembered, for other portions of land embraced in this alleged
grant, on the theory that such portions were vacant and
unoccupied.
This in substance is the evidence of possession, and it cannot, as we think, at all strengthen the presumption of an
approval of the grant and a possession in accordance with it.
Nor do we think there is any evidence upon which to base
a claim of adverse possession of this land as of right or under

BERGERE v. UIITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

some 4laim of title. There is no evidence showing a possession
exclusive in its nature and founded upon a claim of right to
the land so possessed. If there had been evidence of an
approval of the grant, the delivery of juridical possession, as
stated in the return of the alcalde, might be sufficient evidence of title at one time to the whole land, yet, in the absence
of such evidence of approval, we are of opinion that the actual
possession, as proved, was totally insufficient to support a
claim of title to this immense tract of land; nor is it sufficient
to support a presumption that the acting governor did approve
the grant and that what appears upon the torn expediente is
in reality phrt of his written approval thereof. The recognition of the property as belonging to Baca was very probably
a recognition of the occupancy by him of the three hundred
varas above alluded to, and is surely not definite enough to
base a claim that the possession of 'this large amount of land,
by Baca was either notorious or in- any degree exclusive, or
that any portion of it was ever used by him for any purpose
other than the pasturing of his cattle, sheep and horses, and
purposes connected therewith, but' in no way exclusive of
other persons.
In regard to proof of the fact of pasturing cattle as evidence
of an adverse possession upon which to base a claim of title,
we have held that such fact is of very slight weight when
applied to cases arising under alleged grants of land of the
nature of the one under consideration. In the case of Whitne,
v. United State8, already above cited, 167 U. S. 529, 546, this
court said, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, as follows:
"The claimant also relies upon a long continued adverse
possession of this land, maintained for nearly 170 years from
the date of the grant, and nearly eighty years from the date
of the te8t'monio issued by the alcalde mayor, de Baca. Had
it been shown that this possession was complete, adverse and
undisputed during the whole life of this grant, such possession
would probably be egarded as complete evidence of title.
Nor are we disposed to deny that the fact that the Luceros
and their descendants pastured stock upon these lands is evidence of such possession, but in order to make it of any

80

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

particular weight it should be shown to have been exclusive,
and that no other person pastured or had the same right to
pasture upon these lands. The proceedings in the case first
above mentioned, of the intrusion of the iRomeros, indicate
the lands to have been held in common, and to have been
subject to pasturage by the Indians and other residents of
that neighborhood. Under such circumstances, it should be
made to appear that the rights of Lucero and his descendants
were exclusive in this particular. In addition to this, however, it is a fact so notorious that we may take judicial notice
of it, that mere pasturage upon these western lands is veryslight evidence of possession. The court below was of the
opinion that ' from a practical standpoint the grazing of stock
in this country has no value as evidence of practical location?
In view of the fact that all, or nearly all, of this testimony
respecting possession is given by witnesses who are descended
from Lucero, or connected with his family, or are interested
in the litigation, and the possession relied upon is not shown
to have been exclusive, or inconsistent with the use of this
vast tract as a pasturage common to all the dwellers in that
neighborhood, we think the court did not err in refusing to
give it weight as-evidence of title."
These remarks apply with great force to this case, so far as
the evidence herein goes to show actual possession by reason
of the pasturing of stock, which is really all the evidence of.
possession the case affords. It is entirely lacking in evidence
of an exclusive possession under a claim of right, and the
testimony is consistent with a mere occupancy of but a small
portion of the land by Baca and his servants for purposes of
pasturage, and without claim of further or exclusive right or
title.
There is another fact that we think bears with a good deal
of force upon the question whether there ever was an approval .
by the governor and, as connected therewith, whether Baca
himself ever thought that he had or claimed to have any title
to or property in the land described in his petition or in the
repod of' the alcalde, and that fact -isthat he makes no
mention whatever of this property in his will, and does not in

BERGERE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

that instrument claim to have any title to or interest in the
same. The will was put in evidence only for the purpose of
showing the written declarations of Baca as to his ownership
of property and his omission to name the property in question,
and we think it sufficiently proved for that purpose.
The failure to enumerate in his will a particular piece of
property owned by a testator would, in ordinary cases, be of
not the slightest significance. But a perusal of the will under
examination shows, as we think quite plainly, that the testator
was in effect marshalling his assets and mentioning in the
instrument all his property and making specific dispositions
thereof. H6"speaks in great detail of his different pieces of
property, both real and personal. The paper cannot be read
without giving the impression that the testator was naming
therein every piece of real property which he claimed to own.
A reading of the will is the most satisfactory and the best
proof of the correctness of this statement, and the instrument,
with the exception of the formal parts, is therefore given in
full in the margin. '

Opinion of the Court.

for the testator to have overlooked or ignored iii a declaration
of ownership of property such as is contained in this will.
We should infer from this omission that Baca knew he did
not own the land and was aware of the fact that the action of
the alcalde had never been approved by the governor.
From the fact of Baca's omission to name this land as his
property we must infer that such actual possession as he had.
taken of a small portion of this land never led him to suppose
that he was the owner of it or that he had any title to it.
It was in fact an occupation of a comparatively small piece
of the land in question, for the purpose of pasturage, but in
no way exclusive in its nature and under no claim of right
or title. Hence the omission of Baca to mention the land as
his property or to refer to it in any way.
The action of the Mexican government in making grants
to third parties of certain portions of these lands, as vacant
and unoccupied lands, is also of some importance. The grants
were made at times which were long subsequent to the petition
of Baca and the making of the return of the alcalde, and were
made after an official examination of the lands then granted
and a certificate that they were vacant.
We express no opinion as to the validity of these grants,
and we allude to the subject only for the purpose of pointing
out how the facts appeared to the Mexican officials, who, at
and in the third, Don Enrique Luna, and each one in solidum, and I give
them ample power to take possession of my property as soon as I die
and to pay all I owe, and that their collection be lawful and real, and
that they make it with the legality their good conscience may indicate to
them, which charge shall continue for the legal year and as much more
time as they may need, since I extend it. And after it is completed and
everything is paid, in the sale of my property, furniture, real property,
rights and shares, present and future; I constitute as my sole and universal heirs my wife, Dona Maria de la Luz Chaves, and my said children, Maria Rita, Mfanuela Antonia, Maria Manuela, Juan Clemente, Manuel,
and Maria Lugarda, who, after paying all I owe (except what I have
given them), shall make a lump of what is left, the half for my said
wife and the other half to be shared in equal parts by my children that
they may enjoy it with the blessing of God and my own. And by these
presents I revoke and cancel the wills and other testamentary provisions
I may have made heretofore.

BERGERE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

that time, were engaged in an investigation of the question
of occupancy, and who reported the lands mentioned in the
respective grants as vacant and unoccupied, which we may
assume they would scarcely have done had Baca or his heirs
then been in the actual possession and occupation of those
very lands.
We have now referred to the substance of all the evidence
contained in this record and we are compelled to conclude
that the petitioner has failed to make out a title of any kind
to the land in question. While the court below failed to give
judgment to the petitioner for the full amount of her claim,
yet it did give her judgment for the amount already stated
of eleven square leagues of land. The court found that the
grant was an imperfect grant at the time of the cession of
the territory to the United States.
In our view of the case no grant, perfect or imperfect, was
in existence at that time, and hence the finding of the court
that the petitioner was entitled to a confirmation of eleven
square leagues within the limits of the outboundaries of the
tract, cannot be sustained.
The act creating the Court of Private Land Claims (above
cited) provides in the first subdivision of section 13 for the
confirmation of imperfect grants.
This court has construed the language there used to mean
"not only that the title was lawfully and regularly derived,
but that if the grant were not complete and perfect, the
claimant could, by right and not by grace, have demanded
that it should be made perfect by the former government,
had the territory not been acquired by the United States."
Ainsa v. United States, 161 U. S. 208, 223.
The same construction was upheld in United States v. Sant
Fj,165 U. S. 675, 714, and it is again approved in United
States v. SandovaZ, 167 U. S. 278, 293. After a full consideration of the case we must hold there is not sufficient evidence
to show that at the time of the cession of the Territory of
New Mexico to the United States the predecessors or grantors
of the petitioner had any title of any kind whatever, perfect
or imperfect, to the land described in the petition herein, and,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.

consequently, there could be no confirmation of any alleged
imperfect title or grant.
The judgment of the Court of P'ivate.Land Olaims must,
therefore, be reversed on the ajopeal of the United States,
and the recordremanded to that court, with directions to
enterjudgment in conformity with this opinion.

ALASKA MINING COMPANY v. WHELAN.
MRR

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NUITH
CIRCUIT.
No.55. Submitted March 17,1897.-

Decided October 18, 189T.

Where the business of a mining corporation is under the control of a general manager, and is divided into three departments of which the mining
department is one, each with a superintendent under the general manager, and in the mining department are several gangs of workmen, the
foreman of one of these gangs, whether he has or has not authority to
engage and discharge the men under him, is a fellow-servant with-them;
and the corporation is not liable to one of them for an injury caused by
the foreman's negligence in managing the machinery or in giving orders
to the men.

THIS was an action brought in the District Court of the
United States for the District of Alaska against a mining corporation by a workman in its employ. The complaint alleged that "on November 23, 1891, and for nearly six months
prior thereto, this plaintiff was in the employ of said defendant,
as a workman in the mine of said defendant, in breaking
and preparing rock for the chutes, and doing other work as
ordered by the foreman of said defendant, one Samuel Finley,
under whom this plaintiff worked, and from whom he received
his orders; that on November 23, 1891, while this plaintiff was
yet in the employ of said defendant, he was ordered by the
foreman of said defendant company to break rock immediately
above and over one of the chutes of the defendant company;
that in compliance with the orders of the foreman of said
