than the twenty-two square leagues. Was it not a wise
settlement for parties, whose claim to an interest in what
might be found to be less than 100,000 acres rested simply
on a parol agreement therefor, to obtain for that interest a
sum which was more than half what the best government
land could be purchased for? We think it can be well said,
in the language of the Supreme Court of Mew Mexico, "that
the judgment of the court at that time in so considering and

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 879. Submitted October 18, 1897. -Decided

December 6, 1897.

Hyer and Shield were engaged separately, each on behalf of himself and his
associates, in seeking from the city government of Richmond a concession for a street railway with collateral lines. Hyer's organization was
to be called the Richmond Conduit Company, and Shield's the Richrdond
Traction Company. Hyer made a deposit of money in a bank in Richmond to aid in his projects. Hyer and Shield then contracted in writing
as follows, each being fully authorized thereto by his associates: ,We

hereby bind ourselves, in our own behalf and for our associates, mutually to cooperate one with the other in securing a franchise for said
railway and to divide equally between us and our associates whatever
may be realized from the enterprise, first deducting from said amount
whatever actual expenses may have been incurred by either side, such.
expenses to be paid out of the first money realized from said enterprise.
The deposit already made with the State Bank of Richmond, by Hyer or
his associates, is to stand and remain intact as it now is for the purpose
of securing the franchise aforesaid, subject to any conditions for the
withdrawal thereof made by Hyer with the depositor after the seveuteenth
(lay of August, 1895; and further, it is agreed that the application and
franchise to be presented to the common council of the city of Richmond
shall be that of the Richmond Traction Company, for the building of an
overhead trolley railway or cable system." A full statement of the action
of the two companies was made to the Richmond authorities. Hyer fully
performed his agreements. He was unable to go to Richmond when the
matter was settled, and Shield secured the concession for himself and his
associates, and refused to permit Hyer and his associates to participate
in it. By bill in equity, amended'bill and supplemental bill, Hyer sought
to be declared owner of one half interest in the Traction Company's franchise, property and stock, and for a decree securing the possession and
enjoyment thereof. Held, that, without dediding whether the contract
sued on was, under the.facts and circumstances disclosed, void as against
public policy, the case presented was not one which called for the interposition of a court of equity; but that the plaintiff's remedy was by an
action at law.

ON October 30, 1895, appellant, as plaintiff, filed his bill
against the defendants in the Circuit Court of the United
States Tor the Eastern District of Virginia. After some
changes, he, on April 18, 1896, filed an amended and supplemental bill. The sufficiency of this was challenged by demurrer. The demurrer was sustained, and on August 22 a
decree was entered dismissing the bill. From that decree the

plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, which court, on
May 14, 1897, ordered that the decree of the Circuit Court be
affirmed, without prejudice. Whereupon the case was removed
to this court by certiorari.
It appears from the allegations in the amended and supplemental bill that the plaintiff, whose attention had been for
some time d~voted to the matter of street railways in the city
of Richmond, Virginia, succeeded in obtaining from the city
council a franchise for the construction and operation of a

HYER v. RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY.

Statement of the Case.

street railway on Broad street, in that city. An ordinance,
passed on June 17, granted the franchise to the plaintiff and
his associates under the name and style of the Richmond Conduit Company. The terms of this ordinance differed in some
respects from those of the one prepared by the plaintiff, who
declined to accept it or to proceed under it in the form in
which it had passed the council. But upon an open conference
with the committee on streets of the city council plaintiff was
assured that changes would be made rendering the franchise
acceptable to him, provided he would deposit in one of the
banks of the city of Richmond the sum of ten thousand dollars,
upon certain conditions embodied in a paper, prepared by the
city attorney. On July 17 he caused the deposit to be made,
and gave satisfactory guarantees of the good faith of himself
and associates, and of their purpose to construct the railway,
which guarantees, as he was assured, would secure the modification of the grant in accordance with his suggestions.
While in Richmond, and conferring with the various committees
of the city council with regard to this franchise, he became
aware that certain other parties were seeking to secure a grant
of a like franchise to 'them, under the name and style of the
Richmond Traction Company, and that the defendant, P. B.
Shield, wias apparently the head of this movement, but he had
not been successful in obtaining the passage of any ordinance
by the city council. In the early part of August, 1895, the
plaintiff went to the city of New York, to make arrangements
for constructing the railway as soon as the amendments had
been made to the ordinance. While there he was in the banking house of Stewart & Co., who had been advising with him
with a view of aiding him financially in the prosecution of his
enterprise, and there ascertained that the defendant Shield
was also in conference with the said firm of Stewart & Co.,
seeking aid in the prosecution of his Richmond Traction Company scheme. Stewart & Co. advised the consolidation of the
two interests, to wit, the interest of plaintiff and his associates
in the Conduit Company with that of Shield and his associates
in the Traction Cofapany. After some conferences a contract
was entered into between plaintiff and Shield, which took the

attorney from all parties interested in the traction company
scheme, and he did actually represent them.
It was agreed between the parties to this contract that a
full statement and explanation of the action of the two companies should be made to the city authorities of Richmond,
and in fact it was so made. Plaintiff fully performed all the
-promises and covenants entered into in said contract in behalf
of himself and his associates, but being detained by a serious
illness was unable to proceed immediately to Richmond, and
trusted to the defendant Shield and his associates to carry out
other terms of the contract and secure the franchise for the
mutual benefit of both interests. Disregarding this contract,
Shield and his associates secured the passage of an ordinance
granting the franchise to them, and wholly ignoring plaintiff
and his associates. The first section of this ordinance provides:
"That the Richmond Traction Company, composed of John
W. Middendorf, John L. Williams, Everett Waddey, Reuben
Sherreffs, Philip B. Shield, Charles T. Child and W. F. Jenkins, be, and the same is hereby, permitted to construct and
operate a street railway within the limits of the city, along
the following routes, under and subject to the conditions and
provisions hereinafter set forth: A double track in Broad
street," etc. Subsequent sections cast various obligations upon
the company in respect to the construction and operation of
the railway, the use by other companies of the tracks, and the
payment of a certain per cent of the gross receipts into the
treasury of the city. The last section is as follows:
"Fourteenth. Said Richmond Traction Company, and all
such persons as n6w compose said company, or who may hereafter unite with them, are, in virtue of the authority vested in
the common council of Richmond, pursuant to the act of the
General Assembly of Virginia, passed March 20, 1860, entitled

city, and are likewise bound by all the restrictions of said
act."

All, the parties named in the first section of this ordinance
were duly notified of the "claims of plaintiff and his associates,
under the contract of August 9 : notwithstanding which they
ignored plaintiff and his associates, and proceeded to organize
a corporation, taking all the stook to themselves, paying nothing therefor, but receiving certificates purporting to be of fully
paid stock. Plaintiff, after alleging that he is the holder
of all the interests represented by himself and his associates,
prayed that he be decreed the owner of one-half interest in
the Traction Company's franchise, property and stock, and
specifically for certain orders to secure to him the possession
and enjoyment of such interest.

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Two questions arise in this case: First, whether the contract
sued on is, under the facts and circumstances disclosed in the
-bill, void as against public policy; and, if not, whether the
case presented is one which calls for the interposition of a
courtof equity, or should be determined in a court of law.
In respect to the first question, it will be borne in mind

that upon a demurrer, whatever the facts in the case may
really be, we must take them to be as stated in the bill. So,
in determining the question of the validity of this contract it
must be assumed that there was no concealment; that everything was open and public; and nothing withheld from the
knowledge of the city council, or any parties interested in the
,matter. The case thus presented is: Two parties apply separately to a city council for a franchise to construct a street railway. The banker from whom each of the parties is seeking

1IYE

Opinion of the Court.

financial assistance advises them to unite and*make a single
application. They do so, and thereafter the city. council,
aware of both interests, of the two applications, of the advice
to consolidate and the party by whom it is given, and of all
the terms of the consolidation, grants the franchise to only one
of the parties. Was the agreement to unite in one application
against public policy and void?
In the view we have taken of the second of these questions
it is unnecessary to definitely determine the answer which
should be given to the first, though it may not be inappropriate to observe that the vice which is so frequently detected in
contracts and agreements of a similar nature lies in the fact of
secrecy, concealment and deception; the one applicant, though
apparently antagonizing the other, is really supporting the
latter's application, and the public authorities are misled by
statements and representations coming from a supposed adverse but in fact friendly source. It would scarcely be
doubted that two or more parties may properly unite in a
partnership or corporation and thus unitedly make, in the
name of the partnership or corporation, a single application
for a grant or franchise; and, if they may so unite before
any application, it is hot easy to see why they may not so
unite after having once made separate applications, providing
all the facts and circumstances are fully disclosed and the
public and the public authorities act upon full knowledge; and
if they may sometimes so unite, an agreement for uniting is
not necessarily void. As said by the New York Court of Appeals in Atcheson v. -Mallon,43 N. Y. 147, 151: "1Ajoint proposal, the result of honest co6peration though it might prevent
the rivalry of the parties, and thus lessen competition, is not an
act forbidden by public policy. Joint. adventures are allowed.
They are public and avowed and not secret. The risk as well
as the profit, is joint and openly assumed. The public may
obtain at least the benefit of the joint responsibility, and of
the joint ability to do the service. The public agents know,
then, all that there is in the transaction, and can more justly
estimate the motives of the bidders and weigh the merits of
the bid."

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

See also Smilh v. G-re6nlee, 2 Dev. (Law,) 126; Phippen v.
Stickney, 3 Met. 384:; Greenwood on Public Policy, p. 190,
Rule 177.
It may be noticed that there is nothing in the agreement,
reduced to writing, or as interpreted by the facts stated,
which tends to show any thought or purpose of using corrupt or improper influences to secure the action of the city
council.- So that, upon ihe record as it stands, the question
is, narrowly, whether any agreement to unite between parties
who have applied, or contemplate application, for a franchise
is under all circumstances necessarily -void as against public
policy.
The case is also easily distinguishable from those of contracts merely to abstain from bidding. An agreement not
to bid tends to diminish the numbei of bidders, and thus
yprimafacie to lessen the probable profitableness of the sale
or contract. Yet, even in cases of public sales, the rule laid
down by this cdurt is that agreements to unite in a bidding are
not necessarily void. Some other element than the mere fact
of union must exist before the agreement is to be condemned.
Kearney v. TayZor, 15 -How. 494. In that case, at a public
sale a portion of a farm was purchased by a company, organized pending the, sale and making the purchase with the
view of laying out and establishing a town thereon. After
discussing the question of competition, and the reasons which
had led courts to frequently denounce such combinations for
the purpose of bidding, the opinion adds, (p. 520):
"These observations are sufficient to show that the doctrine
which would prohibit associations of individuals to bid at the
legal public sales of property, as preventing competition,
however specious in theory, is too ndrrow and limited for the
practical business of' life, and would oftentimes lead inevitably to the evil consequences .it was intended to avoid. Instead of encouraging competition, it would destroy it. And
sales, in many instances, could be effected only after a sacrifice of the value, until reduced within the reach of the means
of the individual bidders.
"We.must, therefore, look beyond the mere fact of an as-

HYER v. RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY.

Opinion of the Court.

sociation of persons formed for the purpose of bidding at this
sale, as it may be not only unobjectionable, but oftentimes
meritorious, if not necessary, and examine into the object
and purposes of it; and if, upon such examination, it is found
that the object and purpose are, not to prevent competition,
but to enable, or as an inducement to the persons composing
it, to participate in the biddings, the sale should be upheldotherwiise if for the purpose of shutting out competition, and
depressing the sale, so as to obtain the property At a sacrifice.
"Each case must depend upon its own circumstances; the
courts are quite- competent to inquire into them, and to
ascertain and determine the true character of each."
The observations thus made show that every case must -be
determined upon its peculiar facts and circumstances, and the
courts, before condemning an agreement to unite in a bid,
must see that the agreement is such as really destroys the
value of competitive bidding; and these observations, it must
be noticed, were made in respect to a case in which a public
sale had been ordered. The sale was, therefore, something
which must take place, and the question of making a sale
was not discretionary with the sheriff or other officer charged
with the duty of making the sale. But here the city of Richmond was not bound to grant any franchise. It was free to
determine whether it would grant or not, and, if- it did, what
form of street transportation should be adopted, and might
also well consider the character, the financial ability and the
situation of the various applicants in determining to whom
it would be best for the public interests to grant such afranchise.
Where the grantor or vendor has not determined the question of grant or sale, and it is still a matter of discretion
whether the grant or sale shall be made, it would seem that
there were less cogent reasons for denouncing a combination or agreement of parties with a view of making a proposal.

case it appeared that. two parties each contemplated purchasing property belonging to a third. One of the two promised

Opinion of the Court.

obtaining the property and would assist him in making the
purchase. It was held that the agreement was valid. The
court, after referring to the rule pertaining to the cases of
public sales, said: "But in this case the owner of the share of
the estate was under no obligation to sell to any one; and
there was no stipulation to resort to any illegal or improper
means to m'3lead the owner, or to induce a sale by any fraud
or artifice. We do not think such a contract can be held void
as against public policy."
But, as observed, every case must depend upon its own
circumstances, and it may be that when the facts in this case
are disclosed by the testimony they will be found to differ
materially from those stated in the bill. Inasmuch as we are
of the opinion that, even if the contract be valid, the plaintiff's
remedy is in a court of law rather than in a court of equity,
it is not wise to attempt to definitely determine whether,
under the circumstances stated, this contract was or was not
void as against public policy, for such determination might
prove to be, in the final result, the mere answer to a moot
question. It will be more satisfactory to pass upon the question when the surrounding facts are fully developed by testimony.
We pass, therefore, to the second question, which is:
Assuming this contract to be valid, was the plaintiff's .remedy
in equity or at law? According to the allegations, the city
council was aware of the two parties, of their agreement to
unite in one application, of all the facts surrounding theagreenint and proposed union, and with such knowledge it granted
this public franchise to one party alone. In the exercise of its
judgment in respect to the public interests, the city council
determined that it was better that the defendants should have
this franchise than that the united parties should have it. In
the face of this determination by the authorities having special
charge of the public interests, and ignorant as we must be of
the reasons whidh controlled .the city council in making this
award to the one singly rather than to the two jointly, it would
be improper for a court of equity to compel a, consolidation
of those interests. For reasons which must be held to be

HYER v. RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY.

481

Opinion of the Court.

sufficient and controlling, the city council deemed it not wise
to grant this franchise to the two, but gave -it to the one.
Shall the courts overrule this determination, and entrust the
franchise to the two rather than to the one? They have no
general supervision over the judgment and action of public
authorities. The city holds its grantee responsible for the
proper discharge of the duties imposed by its grant of the
franchise.
It may well have determined that it did not
desire the plaintiff to have any interest in it, or anything to
do with the management of the street railway, and that the
best interests of the city would be subserved by committing it,
primarily at least, to the defendants alone. Shall the courts
say that such determination was erroneous, or may be overruled simply because of a private contract between the two
parties? It must be remembered that according to the allegations the city council knew of the union of interests, and yet
declined to recognize such union. It may be said that by
authorizing these defendants to incorporate, it put it in their
power to let the plaintiff and his associates or any one else
into the enterprise. Of course, the city council knew that the
franchise when granted could be alienated by the grantees,
and yet notwithstanding this possible alienation the fact remains that the city council determined that the primary parties to receive the franchise- the ones upon whom the burden
of the contract should be laid -were
the defendants alone,
and not in conjunction With the plaintiff or his associates.
It is obvious that if two interests, which it may be believed
are now not in harmony, if not decidedly antagonistic, are
let into equal control of a frafichise, such as this, the public
interests may suffer. Harmony in management is no inconsiderable factor in securing the best possible results, and if the
parties in interest are of two minds as to how the railway
shall be managed, what improvements shall be made, and, in
general, what shall be done in connection therewith, it is not
difficult to perceive that their antagonism may prevent that
efficiency which will tend to make the street railway of the
greatest advantage to the public.
This conclusion, while not interfering with the right of the

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff to maintain his action at law for the damages resulting from the defendants' breach of contract, at the same time
preserves the city's control over the franchise, and upholds its
determination as to the party or parties to whom it is willing
to entrust such franchise.
But beyond these relations of the public to the enterprise,
courts ar6 not often wont to compel parties to unite interests
and work fogether. And here it may be well to notice that
the contract was not one in terms for a partnership in the
management of the railway, but only one for a division of
the profits. The parties stipulated to coSperate in securing
the franchise and to divide equally the profits, but'left the
question of control aud management unsettled. The applica-.
tion, it is true, was' to be in the name of "the Richmond Traction Company, but who should compose that company was,
according to the last clause of the contract, to be subsequently
determined: It may, hovever, be conceded that there is an
implication of joint ownership as well as of joint interest in
the management, and in the, profits arising therefrom, and
thus it niay be said that the contract was really one for a
partnership. It is seldom that a court of equity will decree
that a partnership which has been agreed upon shall be carried into effect. More frequently it is called upon to release
parties from partnership agreements on the ground that their
antagonism prevents the fulfilment of the purposes of the
partnership, and it would seem like a contradiction to force
antagonistic parties to form a partnership when it is one of
the recognized rules of equity that such antagonism is ground
for dissolving a partnership already existing. It is true that
the ordinance contemplates the formation of a corporation,
and courts will sometimes decree the specific performance of
a contract for the transfer of stock. But the ordinance was
passed after the contract, and, as we have seen, the most that
can be said of the contract is that it conterhplated the creation
of a partnership. The fact that thereafter the city council
deemed it best to provide by ordinance that the grantees of
the franchise should incorporate does not change the scope of
the contract. It is precisely the same that it would have been

HYER v. RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY.

483

Opinion of the Court.

if the council had granted the franchise .to Shield personally,
and authorized him as an individual to construct and operate
the railway. How then can it be said that this contract is to
be deemed one for the transfer of shares of stock in a corporation ? No corporation then existed. The Richmond Traction
Company, in whose name the application was to be made,
was not then a corporation and became one only on the passage of the ordinance. There was no certainty that one would
ever be formed; there was no agreement that one should be
formed, and the rights of the parties must be determined by
the facts as they were at the time of the contract and the
terms which entered into it. But even if it be considered as
a contract specifically for the transfer of stock, what is the
rule in respect to actions in case of a breach thereof? If stock
has a recognized market value, courts will ordinarily leave the
parties to their action at law for damages for breach of the
agreement to sell, but in cases where the stock has no recognized market value, is not purchasable in the market, or has
a value which is not settled, but is contingent upon the future
workings of the corporation, equity will sometimes decree
specific performance of a contract of purchase. It is in reliance upon this that plaintiff claims the right to a decree for
specific performance. The enterprise, he says, is a new one;
it is difficult to put a fair pecuniary value on the stock or on
the franchise. It is one of those things contingent largely on
the successful working of the railway. It must be conceded
that there is force in the contentiofi that only by letting the
plaintiff into the possession of the interest be claims, can adequate compensation be secured. At the same time the present value of the franchise, and therefore of the stock of the
corporation owning the franchise, is not wholly beyond estimate. That which it may have three or four years hence
may depend largely upon the matter of management. But it
is a franchise which has definite possibilities. The miles of
track covered by it, the population adjacent to the liide, and,
therefore, the number of people likely'to avail themselves of
its advantages, the cost of construction and of operation, are
all well-known facts, and upon such known facts it is not

OCTOBER TERAM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

impossible for a jury to form a fair estimate of the value of
the franchise, and,. therefore, of the damago which the plaintiff has sustained by the repudiation of the contract to give
him a half interest in it.
The authorities generally support these views. In Pomeroy's Specific Performance of Contracts, § 290, the author, citing several cases, says: "It is well settled, as a general rule,
that an agreement to enter into a partnership which would be
literally performed by executing the partnership articles, or
to carry on a partnership already, established, will not be
specifically enforced.?'
In Hill v. Palmer, 56 Wisconsin, 123, 129, the court
observes:,
-,"It is also well settled that the wrongful refusal by a party
to a contract of copartnership to permit the firm to commence
business, or, as it is sometimes termed, to launch the partnership business, is ground for an action at, law by the injured
partner to recover damages of the partner whose wrongful act
has defeated the purposes for ,which the copartnership was
formed. The cases which so hold, both in England and this
country are very numerous. Indeed, the authorities seem to
be quite uniform in so holding. The following are a few of
the cases referred to: Venning v. -Leckie, 13 East Term R. 7;
Gale v. Leckie,t2 Stark. 107; MHanning v. Wadsworth, 4 Md.
59; Glaver v. Tuck, 24 Wend. 153; Bagley v. nith, 10 N. Y.

532; 1 Story's Eq. Jur. sec. 665; Collyer on-Part. sec. 245; 2
Lindley on part. (4th:ed.) 1025,,and cases-cited in notes."
Powell v. Maguire, 43 California, 11, disclosed, like the
case at bar, an agreement in respect to a franchise to be
obtained from the legislature for the mutual benefit of plaintiff and defendant. The franchise in that case was for maintaining a steam ferry, and it- appeared that the defendant,
after obtaining the franchise in his own name, constructed a
ferryboat at his own expense, and operated it between the
points named in the charter. The suit was one to obtain

HYER v. RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY.

485

Opinion of the Court.

specific performance of the agreement, and it was held that it
could not be maintained, the court saying, on page 19:
"Upon these facts it is obvious that if the plaintiff's rights
rested solely on a verbal agreement, to the effect that he and
the defendant would establish and maintain the ferry at their
joint expense, and for their joint benefit, without reference to
the franchise, the plaintiff's only remedy would be an action
at law for a breach of contract. He would have no right to
participate in the profits of an enterprise to which he had contributed nothing, and could claim no interest in a bot constructed by the defendant, at his own expense, and for his
own use, nor in the earnings thereof. In such cases it is well
settled that, when the partnership was never launched, and
when one of the copartners has proceeded to conduct the
enterprise in his own name, at his own cost, and for his own
exclusive benefit, excluding the other party therefrom, and
repudiating the partnership agreement, the only remedy of
the injured party is an action at law for a breach of contract.
There would be in such a case, no existing partnership, but
only an agreement to form one, which was never consummated
by launching the enterprise."
In that case, also, it was held that the contract was against
public policy, the facts in respect to the contract not having
been disclosed to.the legislature at the time the franchise was
granted. In respect to this it was said (p. 21):
"When the legislature grants a franchise to a particular
person, his associates and assigns, it delegates to him the right
to select the person thereafter to be associated with him in
the enterprise. . . . But if several persons desiring to
obtain a franchise from the legislature, in which they are all
to be mutually interested, see fit to ask it in the name of one
only, public policy requires that they should be made to rely
solely on his good faith in carrying out the agreement; and
if he repudiates the contract on obtaining the franchise a
court of equity will grant no relief. It may be that, if the
legislature had known beforehand who the real parties in
interest were, they would not have made the grant; and if
the courts could be appealed to, to enforce such secret ante-

cedent agreements, unsupported by any subsequent acts of
the ostensible beneficiary, it is evident that powerful secret
combinations wQuld be formed to procure vicious legislation
under false pretences."
These authorities might be multiplied, but they are sufficient
to show the general rule controlling actions of this kind. For
these reasons and upon these authorities we are of the opinion
that the suit for specific performance cannot be maintained.
The decree of the Circuit Court was one dismissing the bill
absolutely. In view of the doubt which rests as to the
validity of the co'tract we think it should have been a
dismissal without prejudice, and the order will be, therefore, that the case be remanded to the Circuit Court with
directions to modify the decree so as to make it one dismissing the bill without prejudiceio an action at law.
MR. JUSTICE -HARLAN, concurring.

I am of opinion that the object as well as the. effect of the
contract set out in the bill was to diminish' competition in reference to the obtaining of a public franchise. For that reason
it was detrimental to the public interests, and one in respect
of which a court of equity ought not to give any aid to either
party. In addition to this view, it appears upon the face of
the ordinance in question that the city council of Richmond
named the persons by whom, that franchise was to be exercised; and a court of equity ought not to force another party
into connection with those whom the city council thus designated. Aside from these considerations, I am of opinion that
if the plaintiff has any remedy at all, he has an adequate one
at law. Upon this last ground I acquiesce in the judgment of
the majority of the court in this case.

complainant is not entitled to relief in equity. Neither the
agreement between Hyer and Shield of August 9, 1895, nor
the negotiations of these parties with the common council of
the city of Richmond, contemplated or implied a partnership
between them. Not only is it a fact of which we may take
notice that street railways are universally constructed and
operated by corporations, but it was one of the stipulations
of the agreement of August 9, 1895, that "the application
and franchise to be presented to the common council of the
city of Richmond" should "be that of the Richmond Traction
Company for the building of an overhead trolley or cable railway system." The franchise of June 17, 1895, was granted
by an ordinance of this council- to Hiyer and his 4sociates
under the corporate name of the "Richmond Conduit Railway
Company," while the rival c6mpeting scheme -of Shield was
applied for under the name and style of the "Richmond Traction Company." Not only must the common council have
understood that it was contracting with a corporation, but
there is nothing to show that it placed any special reliance
upon the personal qualities of Shield or his associates. Indeed,
the facts set forth in the bill in this connection show conclusively there could have been no such reliance.
While the entire stock of the Richmond Traction Company
may have been taken in their names, there was nothing to
prevent that stock from being transferred at any time, to
other par.ies; nor could the city have had any personal claim
against Shield or his associates. The transaction was with
the corporation, and with the corporation alone, and in a legal
point of view it was a matter of entire indifference to the city
who became the owners of the stock. The entire stock of the
company might have been transferred to other parties the day
after the charter was granted without any violation of its
provisions. In fact, the common council is alleged to have
understood that the interests of the two companies had been
consolidated, and granted the charter to the Traction Company, with knowledge that Hyer and his associates were to
participate equally in the enterprise.
Under such circumstances, we think it clear that the court

should have entertained a bill for the specific performance of
this contract, and not have relegated the parties to the doubtful and unsatisfactory remedy of an action at law. We
understand the rule to be, as stated by Cook on Stock and
Stockholders, section 338, that " if the stock contracted to be
sold is easily obtained in the market, and there are no particular reasons why the vendee should have the particular stock
contracted for, he is left to his action for damages. But
where the value of the. stock is not easily ascertainable, or
the stock is not to be obtained readily elsewhere, or there is
some particular and reasonable cause for the vendee's requiring the stock contracted to be delivered, a court of equity
will decree a specific performance, and compel the vendor to
*deliver the stock."
This principle is particularly applicable to a case of this
kind, where the corporation was but recently formed, the
railroad yet unconstructed, and its shares of uncertain value
- if indeed they had any market value at all. To require
the complainant, under these circumstances, to bring a personal action for a breach of contract against Shield, who is
alleged to be hopelessly insolvent and wholly unable, to respond in damages, is to offer him the shadow and deny him
the substance of relief.
