Statement of the Case.

HARRISON v. PEREA.
PEREA v. HARRISON.
APPEALS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF FEW
MEXICO.
No. 118, 497. Argued November 10, 11, 1891. -Decided

November 29,1891.

When the defendant's answer in a chancery suit sets up matters which are
impertinent, and he also files a cross bill making allegations of the same
nature, a demurrer to the cross bill on that ground should be sustained.
The findings of fact in an appeal from the Supreme Court of a Territory
are conclusive upon this court, whose jurisdiction on such appeal, apart
from exceptions duly taken to rulings on the admission or rejection of
evidence, is limited-to deterihining whether the findings of fact support
the judgment.
It being found that the defendant converted the entire assets which are the
subject of this controversy, there vas no error in charging him 'with
interest on the amount so converted, without regard to whether he did
or did not make profits.
The solicitor was properly allowed a fee from the fund.
An item in the decree below which was not appealed from by the complainant is not before this court for consideration.
A clerical error in the decree of the court below caused by the omission
of the name of one of the distributees, can be corrected, on application,
by the court below after the case is sent down.
The costs in this court must be paid by Harrison personally.

THE bill in the first above entitled suit was filed in a District
Court of the Territory of New Mexico, in chancery, by Pedro
Perea, as sole surviving administrator of the estate of Jos6 L.
Perea, Second, deceased, and as one of his heirs-at-law, against
the defendant, George W. Harrisoi, individually and as administrator of' the estate of his wife, Guadalupe Perea de
Harrison, and also against the other heirs-at-law of Jos6 L.
Perea, Second. It was brought to compel an accounting by
the defendant George W. Harrison, individually and as administrator of the estate of his wife, for the property and
assets of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, which had come
into his hands.
The bill in substance alleged the following facts: Jos6

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.

Perea, Second, a resident of New Mexico, died in that Territory on the 27th of August, 1887, being about the age of eight
years. He left him surviving his mother, Guadalupe Perea,
who was then a widow, and. his half brothers and sisters as
his heirs-at-laW. On the 23d of July, 1884, his mother had
been appointed his guardian and had taken possession of his
property. In September, 1885, she married the defendant
George W. Harrison. She continued guardian of her son up
to his death, in August, 1887. In September, 1887, the complainant was appointed administrator and the mother was appointed administratrix of the estate of the minor. They both
gave bonds and took the requisite oaths. On the 6th of March,
1888, the mother made what she termed a final report of her
guardianship to the probate court, which showed a balance of
over seventeen thousand dollars in her hands belonging to the
estate of the minor. Under the influence of her husband she
claimed, from the time of her son's death down to her own
decease, to hold the property as guardian and not as administratrix, and while acting under that influence she refused to
permit the complainant, after his appointment as administrator, to assist in the administration of the estate, or to have
possession or control over any of its assets. Objections were
made by the complainant to the report filed by the mother in
March, 1888, called the guardian's final account, and these objections were sustained by the probate court. An appeal from
that order was taken by the mother, but no further proceedings
were had therein, and the same was practically abandoned.
The mother died October 20; 1889. Her husband then unlawfully took possession of the property of the minor in her
hands at the time of her death, and subsequently and on the
6th of January, 1890, he took out letters of administration
on her estate, she dying intestate. He then claimed to hold
the estate of the minor by reason of being administrator of
his wife's estate. He took possession of the minor's estate
individually, with full knowledge of its trust character, placed
it to his own credit in bank, mingled it with his own funds,
and claimed the right to retain possession and control thereof,
and refused the demand to pay over the estate to him, which

HARRISON v. PEREA.
Statement of the Case.

the complainant made in his capacity as sole surviving administrator of the estate of the minor. It was also alleged
that the mother of the deceased minor, acting under the influence and by the direction of her husband, and the defendant
Harrison himself, individually, did by their actions cause great
damage to the estate of the minor, and relief was demanded
against the defendant Harrison as administrator of his wife's
estate, and individually for an accounting in relation to the
estate of the minor, of which he was in possession, and for a
recovery of the amount found to be in his possession.
The defendant Harrison demurred to the bill, his demurrer
was overruled, and he then answered both individually and as
administrator of the estate of his deceased wife. In that
answer the defendant denied many of the material allegations
contained in the bill. He alleged that he and the defendant
Grover William Harrison, who was minor child of himself and
his deceased wife, Guadalupe Perea de Harrison, had succeeded
to alr the interest and rights of his said wife in and to the property of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, and for that reason
the complainant was not entitled to a decree for anything
upon the accounting. The answer also alleged that the
complainant was a son and also one of three administrators
of the estate of the late Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, (two of complainant's brothers being the -other administrators,) and that
those administrators had failed to account for a large sum of
money which was due from the estate of Joss L. Perea, the
.elder, to Jos6 L. Perea, Second, in his lifetime, and afterwards
to his estate; and it was alleged that large amounts of property
had come into the hands of such administrators of the estate
of the deceased father, Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, of which no
account had been made, and that the _ro rata share of the
minor, JosA L. Perea, Second, in these assets so unaccounted
for would amoufnt to thirty thousand dollars.
The complainant excepted to so much of the answer as contained the above allegations relating to the estate of the elder
Perea and the action of the administrators with regard thereto,
upon the ground of impertinence.
The defendant, by leave of court, also filed a cross bill, in

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statemdnt of the Case.

which in very great detail he set forth the condition of the
estate of the elder Perea and the action of the administrators
thereof. Among other things it was alleged that the elder
Perea in 1842 married his first wife and they.lived together
until 1877, when she died; that he had by her six daughters
and six sons, and that he brought into the marriage community a large amount of property, real and personal, amounting
to a hundred thousand dollars, acquired by him by inheritance,
bequest arid other means, and in addition personal property of
the value of'about three hundred thousand dollars, and that at
the time of his marriage his wife owned in her own right and
brought into the marriage community real property situate
in the Territory of New Mexico of the value of thirty thousand
dollars and personal property of the value of thirty thousand
dollars; that this property of the husband and wife became
upon their marriage property of the marriage community, and
so continued to remain the property of the -parties, to which
large accretions and additions were made by the industry and
labor of the husband and wife, so that at the time of the
death of the wife in 1877 the full value of the united property
was three hundred thousand dollars of realty and five hundred
thousand dollars of personalty, and that all of this property,
except the amount brought into the marriage community, was
gain and increase of that property and belonged in equal
parts to the husband and wife.
It was further alleged that in 1883 the elder Perea died,
and that his estate had not'been properly administered'; that
property belonging to the estate had not been inventoried as
such; that the conduct of the administrators had been wasteful, the estate had not been properly taken care of, and that
the administrators had expended large amounts -6fthe community property in the purchase of real property, so that such
property had been unlawfully converted into worthless real
property. It was also alleged that a pretended settlement had
been made before the probate judge in New Mexico, and the
administrators had made an accounting before the court, and
had obtained their discharge and t'he cancellation of their
bonds by that court; that this settlement before and discharge

by the probate court was a fraudulent. one and fraudulently
obtained, and that the decree should be set aside. It was
also alleged that the defendant Harrison and his wife had
before her death commenced a suit against the complainant
and the other defendants who were administrators of the
estate of the elder Perea,. asking for an accounting in regard
to the identical matters and things set up in this cross bill; and
that such suit was still pending and undetermined at the time
of the commencement of this suit by the complainant herein.
Various other matters in relation to the management of the
estate of the elder Perea were set forth in th6 cross bill at
very great length, and relief was demanded .in accordande
with what was alleged to be his rights by such complainant.
This relief was of .all varieties, including ani investigation into
accounts and matters relating to community property arising
out of the marriage of the elder Perea in 1842, and an inquiry
as to what was such property and its proper increase; also
injunctions, accountings, decrees for conveyance, for distribution, for removal of the administrators; for the annulling of
the pretended and fraudulent decree discharging the administrators and finally settling their accounts, and for-the appointment of a receiver of the estate of the elder Perea.
To this cross bill the complainant herein demurred upon
several grounds, the substance" being that it was multifarious
in that it was brought in regard to matters having no connection with the subject-matter of the original bill, and not.
proper to be investigated in this suit.
The exceptions to the answer and the demurrer to the cross
bill were argued at the same time, and, after hearing counsel,
the court allowed the exceptions and struck out the matter
excepted to, and it also sustained comnplainant's demurrer to
the cross bill.
The case then being at issue was duly referred to a master,
before whom both parties appeared and introduced their
proofs, after which the master made his report. Upon that
report and the evidence taken before the master, the case was
brought to a hearing, and the court found in substance that
the allegations set forth in complainant's bill were true. The

court also found that Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, died about the
21st day of April, 1883, and left his widow, Guadalupe Perea,
(who afterwards married the defendant George W. Harrison,)
and the other defendants in this suit, with the exception of
George W. and Grover William Harrison, his heirs-at-law.
Jos6 Perea, Second, was the son of the elder Perea by his
second wife, Guadalupe Perea. After the death of the elder
Perea, his widow married, as heretofore stated, the defendant George W. Harrison, and by him she had issue, Grover
William Harrison, one of the defendants herein. With these
exceptions all of the defendants were children of the elder
Perea by a former wife. Pedro, Mariano and Jesus M. Perea
were appointed administrators of the estate of their deceased
father.
The court also found that the defendant George W. Harrison, not only upon the death of his wife had control, but that
immediately after their marriage he took control and charge
of the assets of the deceased ninor, and at the time of the
entry of the decree herein he still retained and had possession
of all the moneys belonging to that estate, and that they were
subject to his individual control.
At the time of the death of the minor he owed no debts
and there were no charges against his estate except his funeral
expenses and the expenses of his last illness an& certain
claims for his maintenance by his guardian. The defendant
George W. Harrison, in the name of his wife-and in her lifetime, made sundry reports to the probate court as to the condition of the estate, some of which contained false entries to
her advantage, and together they obstructed the distribution
of the estate among the heirs.
The court also found that George W. Harrison, the defendant, wilfully obstructed the distribution of the assets of the
estate of the minor, and by his misconduct rendered it necessary that the complainant should obtain possession of the
assets by the institution of this suit, and that the necessity
for this suit arose entirely out of the wrongful conduct of the
defendant Harrison.
The amount found due from the defendant to the com-

plainant was stated in the decree to be, with interest up to
the date of the entry of the decree, June 19, 1893, the sum
of $31,545.32, of which the defendant Harrison was entitled
as administrator of the estate of his late wife, Guadalupe Perea
de Harrison, to thirteen twenty-sixths, and to three twentysixths in addition by reason of the purchase of the interests
of some of the heirs of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second,
and to one twenty-sixth more, as guardian of Grover William
Harrison, one of the defendants, being a total of seventeen
twenty-sixths; and the other heirs were each decreed entitled
to one twenty-sixth of such balance; and it was provided in
the decree that the defendant Harrison might, instead of turning over to the complainant, the administrator of Jos6 Perea,
Second, the full sum found due, retain the amount found due
him from the estate, which was stated to be the sum of
$16,227.19. The defendant George W. Harrison was also
charged with the payment of the costs of the suit individually, including the sum of one thousand dollars allowed the
special master.
From the final decree thus entered the defendant George
W. Harrison appealed to the Supremb Court of the Territory
of New Mexico, which court, with some modifications, affirmed
the judgment of the court below. Those modifications consisted in charging interest upbn the full amount of the sum
found due by the decree of the court below, from the time
of the entry of that d*ecree up to the 26th of August, 1895,
which amounted to the sum of $4321.45, and the defendant
was charged in the decree 6f the last named -date -with the
full sum of $35,869.77. The fee for the solicitor of complainant was reduced from $5000 to $3586.97, being ten per cent
upon'the amount found in the hands of the defe-dant Harrison. The complainant, as administrator, was decreed to be
entitled to the statutory commission upon the last named sum
found by the court to be due from the defendant Harrison,
which commission amounted to $1943.48. The court also reduced the compensation of the special master from $1000 to
$500. The court also 'modified the decree against Harrison
for the payment of costs individually, by directing "that the

said solicitor's fee, the said commission for said administrator,
the said special master's fee, and all of the costs of this case
in this court and in the court below, should be paid out of said
fund, and that of the remainder the said defendant George W.
Harrison may retain in his possession seventeen twenty-six.th
parts thereof, and that he shall pay over to said Pedro Perea,
as administrator of Jos6 L. Perea, deceased, the remaining
nine twenty-sixths, to be distributed to the heirs at law of said
Jos6 Leandro Perea5 Second," as directed by the court. From
the judgment of affirmance as modified the defendant George
W. Harrison has appealed to this court. The complainant
also took a cross appeal from the judgment.
Mr. Tilliam B. Childers for Harrison.
-Mr.NAeill B. _Field for Perea.
MnR. JusTicE P bKEHAM, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

The question first arising in this case is in regard to the
correctness of the decisions of the courts below in allowiig
complainant's exceptions to portions of the answer of the
defendant Harrison and in sustaining the demurrer to defendant's cross bill. The decision of the two matters rests in this
case upon essentially the same foundation. If the allegations
of the defendant's answer to the original bill are impertinent,
it would follow that in this .case the cross bill would be multifarious, and that the demurrer on that ground should be sustained. The allegations in the two pleadings are of the same
nature, only in the cross bill they are very greatly extended
and set forth in almost infinite detail.
Impertinence is described by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert to
be: "Where the records of the court are stuffed with long
recitals, or with long digressions of matter of fact, which are
altogether unnecessary and totally immaterial to the matter
in question." 1 DanielPs Chancery P1. & Pr., (5th Am. ed.)
marginal paging, 349. It is also said that impertinence is the
introduction of any matters in a bill, answer or other pleading

in the suit which are not properly before the court for decision
at any particular stage of the suit. Wood v. Mann, 1 -Sumner,.
578. "The best test to ascertain whether'matter be impertinent is to try whether the subject of the allegation be put in
issue in the matter in dispute between the parties." All matter not material to the suit is regarded as impertinent. Woods
v. .MorreZl, 1 Johns. Ch. 103; .1 Daniell, s8ura, 349, note.
As to multifariousness, it was said in Shields v. Thomas, 18
How. 253, 259: "There is, perhaps, no rule established for the
conducting of equity pleadings, with reference to which (whilst
as a rule it is universally admitted) there has existed less of
certainty and uniformity in application, than has attended this
relating to multifariousness. This effect, flowing, perhaps inevitably, from the variety of modes and degrees of right and
interest entering into the transactions of life, seems to have
led to a conclusion rendering the rule almost as much an
exception as a rule, and that conclusion is, that each case
must be determined by its peculiar features. Thus Daniell,
in his work on Chancery Practice, vol. 1, p. 384, quoting from
Lord Cottenham, says: IIt is impossible, upon the authorities,
to lay down any rule or abstract proposition, as to what constitutes multifariousness, which can be made universally applicable. The cases upon the subject are extremely various,
and the court, in deciding upon them, seems to have considered what was convenient in particular cases, rather than to
have attempted to lay down an absolute rule."
Continuing
his opinion, the learned justice in the above case said: "Justice Story, in his compilation upon equity pleading, defines
multifariousness in a bill to mean ' the improperly joining in
one bill distinct and independent matters, and thereby confounding them.'
.
.
Justice Story closes his review of
the authorities upon this defect in a bill with the following
remark: 'The conclusion to which a close survey of the
authorities will conduct us, seems to be, that there is not any
positive inflexible rule as to what, in the sense of a court of
equity, constitutes multifariousness, which is fatal to a suit
on demurrer.'"
Upon consideration of the various cases, we think that in.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

allowing the exceptions to the answer and in sustaining the
demurrer to the cross bill, the courts below committed no
error. The facts which the defendant Harrison endeavored
to set up in his answer and cross bill were not relevant to the
matters properly in issue in this suit. 'Neither the convenience of the parties nor their rights in regard to the matters
set forth in the original bill would be aided by entering upon
an inquiry relating to the matters set up in the answier and
cross bill. It is clear that an investigation and accounting,
such as is asked for in the cross bill, would take a long time,
probably many years, to finish, involving as it would an inquiry into the amount of the community property of the elder
Perea and his wife in 1842, and what should be found to be
the actual increase springing from the same; also an inquiry
into the transactions of the administrators of the estate of the
elder Perea and into their liability on account of the -same,
together with the taking of evidence upon the subject of
the fraudulent chaiacter of the decree of the probate court
discharging the administrators of that estate. It would in
addition include an inquiry into the question whether the
administrators, if the decree were set aside, had been guilty
of such conduct in the care and management of the estate
coming into their hands as would make them liable for any
loss sustained by the estate in consequence of such action. In
fine, it is seen that the character of the investigation demanded by the cross bill and of the relief sought thereby is
extensive enough to call for an almost interminable amount
of research and labor.. These considerations .are not"of the
slightest moment when weighed against the legal rights of the
parties interested in the question; and their right to have such
investigation made and adequate and proper relief granted is
not'a matter of discretion or of favor. If they have not slept
upon their rights and if they come into court at the proper
.time and in a prbper action, the court will enter upon the
necessary investigation and grant such relief as they may be
entitled to. On the other hand, these considerations are
"most material and vital upon the question of the necessity
or propriety of such an investigation in this suit which was

HARRISON v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Court.

brought for a different purpose, and which would be necessarily greatly delayed in its termination if such an inquiry.
should be now entered upon.
Let us look for a moment at the simple character of this
suit. It is brought to recover as administrator the assets of
the estate of the minor already mentioned, the possession of
which the defendant Harrison does not deny. He shows
no right to them as against the complainant, because the
facts he sets up in his answer form no defence. Nor do the
same facts when set forth in the cross bill constitute a cause
of action against this complainant, proper to be proved and
defended against in this suit, as 'against the demand of the
complainant herein. It is plain that the complainant, as the
surviving administrator of the estate of the deceased minor,
was entitled to the immediate possession of all the assets of
such estate. Upon the death of the niinor the guardianship
of the mother ceased, and as she was thereupon appointed
administratrix, her continuing to hold the assets of the estate
from the time of such appointment was as administratrix and
not as guardian. The counsel for Harrison says in his brief
that he is disposed to concede this proposition. It is plainly
true. Her right or duty to account, as guardian, did not
affect the title to the property upon the death of the ward.
That title became vested in the administrator and administratrix upon their appointment. 1 Williams on Executors, (6th
Am. ed.) 696. The plaintiff herein, as coadministrator, had
the same legal title to the assets that she had. The advantage of possession was with her. But on the death of the
administratrix the complainant remained the sole surviving
administrator, and in him was vested the exclusive title and
the right to the immediate possession of the assets of the
estate of the deceased minor. Instead of obtaining that
possession he finds all the assets in the hands of the defendant Harrison, who refuses to give them up. Their amount
is not really in controversy. The defendant shows no right
or title whatever to them. It is no answer to the demand
that the defendant should pay over the sum which is in substance acknowledged to be in his possession, to say that -the
VOL. CLxvI-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

minor's estate may be increased after an accounting shall be
had and judgment obtained and the money paid over in the
matter of the estate of the elder Perea. -The claim upon that
estate, so far as the defendant' Harrison is concerned, either
individually or as administrator of his deceased iife, is altogether too remote and too disconnected from the issues
properly joined in the original suit herein to make it necessary; on his demand, to turn aside from their decision until
that claim shall be hereafter and in this suit determined. It
would be entering upon an investigation into inatters connected with a different estate, an inquiry into which would
involve innumerable questions which would have no bearing
upon the decision as to the right of defendant to retain these
particular'funds now in his individual possession and treated
by him as his own.
It must also be borne in mind that the defendant Harrison
has an action pending against the complainant herein and the
other and surviving administrator of the estate of the elder
Perea, together with his other heirs-at-law, in regard to these
very matters which are set up in his cross bill herein. Indeed,
this cross bill contains nothing material beyond the allegations
which arecontained in the complaint in his first suit. The allegations in that suit are reintroduced in the cross bill word for
word, and the relief prayed for in the cross bill is the same.
From all the facts thus appearing in complainant's original bill,
in the answer and the cross bill of the defendant Harrison, it is
plain that the matters set up in the answer and in the cross
bill in regard to which the defendant seeks investigation in
this suit are not proper subjects of inquiry herein, because
not connected with the issues sought to be decided in the
original bill, and it would result in great. and unnecessary
delay in the decision of this suit to reverse this judgment
and direct an investigation into matters which are foreign
to its merits. We are of opinion the court below committed
no error in allowing complainant's exceptions to the answer
and in sustaining his demurrer to the cross bill.
The decision thus arrived at includes the main question in
the case. There are some few other matters to be reviewed.

HARRISO'F v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Court.

Our further examination must proceed upon the finding of
facts as made by the court below, for this being an appeal
from the Supreme Court of a Territory those findings are
conclusive upon this court. The jurisdiction of this court on
such an appeal, apart from exceptions duly taken to rulings
on the admission or rejection of evidence, is limited to determining whether the findings of fact support the judgment.
Strinfelow v. Cain., 99 U. S. 610; Ne8Zin v. Well, 101 U. S.
428; Eilers v. Boatman, 111 U. S. 356; Idaho and Oregon
Land Company v. Bradbury, 132 U. S.509; Mfammoth Xining Company v. Salt Lake Machine Company; 151 U. S.447,

573; Bear Lake. and River Water Works and Irrigation
Company v. Garland, 164: U. S. 1, 18.
Objection is made to that portion of the decree which holds
the defendant Harrison liable as an individual for the repayment of the amount of the assets of the estate found in his
possession. The findings of fact amply justify this action of
the court. It is found that immediately upon the intermarriage of the defendant Harrison with the widowed mother
of the minor he took entire charge and control of her affairs,
including the assets of the minor's estate; that he reduced
them to money, mingled the same with his own funds, deposited them in bank to his individual credit and at the time
of the final decree he retained the same subject to his individual control. The court also found that he made reports in
the lifetime of his wife, and in her name to the probate court,
which contained false entries to the advantage of his wife,
and that together they obstructed the distribution of the
estate among the heirs; that upon the death of his wife on
the 20th of October, 1889, he was in possession of these assets
with full knowledge of their trust character, and*after her
death he refused to pay over on demand, to the complainant
as the sole surviving administrator of the estate of the minor,
the as sets pertaining to that estate. These facts show a persistent, deliberate and successful attempt'to secure and retain
the assets of this estate and to convert them to his own use

324:

OCTOBER TERIM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

individually. The facts found show that he was guilty of such
conversion. Cases are cited by defendant's counsel where
payments wrongfully made by an administrator to a third
person could not be recovered directly from such third person
at the suit of a creditor of the estate, the estate itself not
being insolvent. Those cases and the one at bar have no
resemblance to each other. This is a case where the whole
assets of the estate have been .wrongfully and knowingly
taken and converted to the individual use of this defendant,
and the action is brought to recover the same by the sole
surviving administrator of the estate. Nor is it a question
of following the specific property which was taken by the
defendant. The finding is that he reduced the assets and
property of the estate to money and mingled the same with
his own funds,, and has kept control of them ever since. The
question of identification has nothing to do with the case. It
is a bald case of the conversion of the whole estate of the
minor, and his liability to pay it back is plain and clear.
Nor did the court below err to tlie prejudice of the defendant in the matter of charging him with interest at six per
cent on the amount of the assets converted by him. The
interest is charged by reason of his conversion of the whole
assets of the estate. "It is not a mere mingling of the funds
with his own, while recognizing his liability to repay them
and having them at the same time ready to respond when
demanded. It is a wholesale conversion of the entire assets.
The facts found make the inference perfectly clear that such
conversion was intended from the time of his marriage with
the mother of the minor. His false entries in the reports are
very strong evidence in that direction.
Neither is it a question of what profits (if any) have been
made by an individual who has mingled trust fund with his
own and used them for his personal benefit, although never
denying his liability to account. In such cases it is sometimes proper to inquire what profits have been made in order'
to charge the trustee with their amount, if greater than the
usual rate of interest. This is not such a question. The
defendant has, without the least right or title, taken moneys

HARRISON v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Court.

belonging to the estate of a deceased minor, and converted
them substantially to his own use, while denying the right of
the administrator of such estate to the possession thereof. He
is properly charged, at least, with the usual interest without
investigation -into the question of what profits he may have
made.
That portion of the decree which authorizes the complainafit
as administrator to retain.his statutory commissions upon the
full fund found due from the defendant is objected to, and the
claim is made that he is not entitled to commission on any
other sum than that which he actually receives "andpays out.
The decree determines the amount due from the defendant
to the complainant as administrator. Strictly speaking, the
complainant was entitled to a decree for the paymert of that
fall sum by the defendant, after which he would be paid the
distributive share legally coming -to him. If that course had
been followed and such a decree given, the complainant would
have been entitled to his statutory fees, as administrator, upon
the amount thus paid in - but by the favor of the court, the
defendant Harrison was permitted, instead of making this
formal payment, to retain in his possession the seventeen
twenty-sixths of the estate which the court decided he would
be entitled to ieceive from the administrator, upon his making
distribution of such estate to the parties entitled to it. The
court in pursuance of this course did not relieve the estate from
the payment of the full afhount of the commissions of complainant as administrator which he would have been entitled
to, had the amount which the defendant retained been actually
and physically paid over into his hands. As to this, the defendant has no good ground of complaint.
The defendant also objects to the allowance of the solicitor's
fee which is charged against the fund. We think no error
arises from this action of the court below. By the exertions
of the solicitor the fund was recovered, and it was properly
made to bear some portion of the expense of its administration.
The amount was within the judicial discretion of the court,
and in fixing that amount the trial court could proceed upon
its own knowledge of the value of the solicitor's services.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U. S. 527; .Fowl r v. Equitab e
Trust Co., 141 U. S. 411, 415.
These are substantially all the questions which arise upon
the appeal of the defendant" Harrison.
Upon the cross appeal of the complainant he seeks to modify
the judgment of the Supreme C6urt in regard to the parties
to the distribution, as he claims that the fund should be distributed, one half.to.the administrator of the deceased mother
of the minor and the other half among his twelve half brothers and sisters, (children of. the minor's father,) to the exclusion of the minor's half brother, Grover William Harrison,
(the son of his mother by her husband Harrison,) who by the
judgment of the court is permitted to share in such distribution. As the trial court made that decree and the complainant did not appeal from it, and the Supreme- Court has simply
affirmed that provision,, the complainant's appeal from the
latter decree does not, in our opinion, bring up this question
for review. All that the complainant could claim in the Supreme Court was the affirmance of the judgment as given in
the court below, because, as he had not appealed from it, he
could not be heard to ask for its modification or reversal.
When the Supreme Court affirmed that provision of the decree
the complainant's appeal from that court would not bring the
propriety of the provisiofi for distribution before us.
Upon his cross appeal the complainant also asks for. a
modification of the deciee with regard to the rate of interest
charged against defendant, claiming it ought to be 12 instead
of 6 per cent. We cannot interfere with the rate charged in
the original decree, because the complainant has not appealed
therefrom, and we do not think we ought to interfere with the
rate of 6 per cent charged by the Supreme Court upon the
total amount of the original decree froni the time it was
entered. It was to a certain extent discretionary with the
latter court, and we think we are riot called upon to alter and
increase the rate charged by that court.
Although the complainant herein did not appeal from the
original decree entered by the trial court, yet upon defendant
Harrison's appeal therefrom the Supreme Court modified the

Opinion of the Cort.

decree in some particulars, and specially in regard to costs.
charging them upon the fund instead of against the defendant
Harrison individually, as was the decree below. This was a
modification of the judgment against the interest of and unfavorable to the complainant herein, as it reduced the amount
of the fund for distribution. This question can be reviewed
upon the complainant's cross appeal. Weare of opinion that
there was no proper ground for the modification of the decree
as to costs made by the trial court.
The defendant Harrison, by the finding of the court, has
wilfully obstructed the distribution of the assets of this estate,
and by his misconduct has rendered it necessary that the complainant should obtain possession of them by the institution of
this suit, and the necessity for commencing it arose entirely out
of his wrongful conduct. This is the finding as' approved by
the Supreme Coirt of the Territory. The otJher findings,
showing the false accounts, the wrongful conversion of these
moneys, and the wrongful and persistent refusal to pay them
over, on demand made b the administrator, altogether make
out a gross case against the defendant, and leave no reasonable
foundation for permitting him, as the Supreme Court does, to
defend this action entirely at the expense of the fund and with
no personal, responsibility for costs. We see no plausible
ground for this privilege.
A clerical error seems to have been made in the distribution
by the Supreme Court. One twenty-sixth part of the estate
is. undisposed of by the judgment. It provides for the payment of seventeen twenty-sixths to defendant Harrison, and
distributes the remaining nine twenty-sixths, one ninth to
each of eight named distributees. One name has been accidentally omitted. This can be corrected on application by
the court below.
The provision making all the costs payable out of the fund
cannot stand, and the decree should charge defendant Harrison with costs personally as in the original decree entered
by the trial court, with the exception that the amount of
the fee of the special master is retained at .5500. All the
costs in this court must be paid by the defendant Harri-

son personally. The decree of the Supreme Court of New
Mexico is therefore
Reversed on the cross appeal of Perea, and the cause remanded with instructionsto enter judgment in conformity
with 'this opinion, with li'erty to change the distribution
upon application if it shall appearproper.

KARRICK v. HANNAMAIT.

its -continuance, undertakes, of his own will, and without the consent of
his copartner, to dissolve the partnership, takes exclusive possession of
its property and business, profitably carries on the business with the
property for his own benefit, and excludes his copartner from any participation in the business or the profits, is liable (whether the partnership should or should not be considered as having been dissolved by his
acts) to account to the copartner for his share of the property and of
the profits of the partnership, according to the partnership agreement.

Tmis was a suit broiight April 17, 1890, in the third judicial
district court of the Territory of Utah, by Hannaman against
Karrick for the dissolution of a partnership, formed February
-3, 1886, by an agreement in writing, by which they agreed to
become partners in a mercantile and laundry business for the
term of five years from that date, with a capital stock of
$25,000, of which the plaintiff was to furnish $5000, and the
defendant $20,000; the.defendant lent the plaintiff the sum
of $5000 for five years, for w hich the plaintiff gave a promissory note, payable at the end of that time, and secured *by
mortgage upon his interest in the partnership property; the
plaintiff was to give his entire time and attention to the
partnership business, and the defendant was to devote to it
only such time as he should see fit; the plaintiff to have the
control and management of the business generally and entirely, except as the defendant might designate, and such
matters to be subject to mutual agreement; one half of the
