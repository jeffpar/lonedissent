0. v. AUSTIN.

685

Syllabus.

this court on appeal from a Circuit Court of the United States,
and its decision involved ascertaining the meaning of the tax
laws of the State as interpreted by the court of last resort
.thereof. In performing this duty the court adopted and followed the construction given to the-tax laws of the State by
the Supreme Court Of the State whence the case came.
There is a claim asserted in argument that as a particular
section of the act of 1884: provided that the sum of. the bid
at a tax sale should be paid into the state treasury, therefore
it is clearly unconstitutional, since, in a case where the bid exceeded the taxes, the surplus money of the owner would go
into- the state treasury without provision for its repayment.
But this is a mere abstract contention, since the fact is that
the sum bid at the tax sale in question was less than the
amount of the taxes assessed against the property.

PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. AUSTIN.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 44. Argued April 23, 1897. -Decided

January8, 1898.

The complainants in their bill predicated their right to relief upon the averment that certain ordinances adopted by the municipal authorities of
Austin, and an act of the legislature of Texas referred to in their bill
Impaired the obligations of a contract which the bill alleged had been
entered into with the complainants by the city of Austin, and that both
the law of the State and the city ordinances were in contravention of
the Constitution of the United States. Held, that these allegations plainly
brought the case within the provision in the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,
26 Stat. 826, conferring upon this court jurisdiction to review by direct
appeal any final judgment rendered by a Circuit Court in any case in
which the constitution or a 1aw of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.
The reason upon which the rulethat the mere assertion of a claim, unaccompanied by any act to give effect to the asserted right, cannot avail to
keep alive a right which would otherwise be precluded because of laches,
is based not alone upon the lapse of time during which the neglect to

enforce the right has existed, but upon the change of condition which
may have arisen during the period in which there has been neglect, and
when a court of equity finds that the position of the parties has so changed
that equitable relief cannot be afforded without doing injustice, or that
the intervening rights of third persons may be destroyed or seriously
impaired, it will not exert its equitable powers in order to save one from
the consequences of his own neglect.
The facts in this case bring it within that rule.

THE court below sustained a demurrer to and dismissed for
want of equity the bill of the complainants, by which, as
citizens of the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland and New
York, respectively, they impleaded the defendants, the one
a municipal corporation breated by a law of the State of
Texas, and its Mayor and Board of Public Works, citizens of
the State of Texas, and the other a corporation organized
under the authority of the general laws of the State of Texas
regulating the formation of corporations, also a citizen of that
State:

The bill, which was filed on January 3, 1895, alleged in
substance as follows: That the city of Austin was in 1892 a
municipal corporation, and that for many years its inhabitants
and the city itself for municipal purposes had been supplied
with water by a corporation known as the City Water Company; that in.1882, in consequence of the growth of the city,
both for the health of the people of the city, the safety of its
property, and the development of its manufacturing industries,
a larger supply of water was absolutely needed, and that the
taxpayers presented a petition to the city authorities asking
that an arrangement by contract or otherwise be at once
made to afford the augmented water supply which was essential; that the municipality, being fully empowered by its
charter to supply water and being authorized by the general
laws of the State of Texas to make a contract for so doing,
on the 13th day of April, 1882, did enter into a contract with
the City Water Company to the end that a more copious
supply of water should be furnished; that this contract gave
to the company the right to furnish water for twenty years,
with the privilege on the part of the city of buying at the end
of ten years, or at any time on giving one year's notice, the

water works which the contract required the company to
erect; that the contract fixed a reasonable price to be paid
for the use of water to be furnished by the water company,
provided for the establishment of a given number of hydrants
for the use of the city, and stipulated a rental therefor; that
it imposed upon the corporation obligations of the most onerous character, compelling it to erect a large and costly plant,
to.lay extensive mains and pipes, and to extend them at any
time during the life of the contract wherever the city might
direct, and exacted that the company should add ne* hydrants
for municipal uses as the city might require, giving to the
water company as compensation in addition to the rentals to
be paid by the city for hydrants, as above stated, a commuta-

tion of municipal taxation.
The bill averred that the contract was in all respects advantageous to the' city and beneficial to its inhabitants, and was
indeed as to each and every obligation contained therein or
resulting therefrom reasonable and just; that the city at the
time the contract was entered into was not in a position to
itself erect the works without inordinately increasing its burden of taxation, and that the contract contemplated that the
water company should obtain the money to erect the works
by issuing its negotiable bonds, since there was therein contained a stipulation that the money to become due for the
rentals of the hydrants should be paid by the city to the
trustee of any bonds which might be issued by the water company, so as to guarantee the prompt payment -of the interest
on any such bonds; that the water company, on the faith of
the contract, issued to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company
its negotiable bonds for $250,000, secured them by mortgage
upon all its property, present and prospective, and with the
sum thus realized and other available resources, with integrity
and fidelity and in complete compliance with every obligation
resting on it, erected the desired water works plant, which
afforded the desired supply of water; that of the bonds thus
issued to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, $100,000 in
amount were bought for more than their face value in open
market by the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, one of

the complainants. The bill moreover alleged that, in March,
1883, after the plant had been constructed and many miles
of mains had been laid, the city, by ordinance duly enacted,
accepted the work, and declared that the wvater company had
fully performed its obligations. That subsequent-to this date,
the city directed a very large extension of the m4ins and pipes
to be made, which was promptly executed by the water company with money obtained from an additional issue of bonds
to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company amounting to
$100,000, $10,000 of which Jacob Tome,'another of the complainants, bought for full .value in open market.
The bill then alleged that in 1884 the city of Austin contracted with a corporation known as the Austin Electric Light
Company to build and carry on a plant required to light that city,
and that this corporation issued its bonds to carry out its corporate purposeg to the extent of $25,000. That'in June, 1887,
all the plant rights, privileges, franchises and obligations of
this electric light company, as well ap those of the water com-pany, were, with the consent and approval of the city of
Austin, transferred to a corporation known as the Austin
Water, Light and Power Company, a Texas corporation
having corporate capacity both to undertake the duty of
supplying water and of furnishing light to the city of Austin;
that, in consequence of its assumption of all the obligations of
both the aforementioned companies, the Austin Water, Light.
and Power Company was required by the city to make considerable additions to its water mains, and, in order to obtain
the capital to execute these directions of the city, that company issued to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of New
York $750,000 of bonds, secured by mortgage upon all its
property, $375,000 of these -bonds being reserved to pay the
outstanding bonds, (that is, the $250,000 first issue of the
water 6ompany, the $100,000 second issue and the $25,000
issue by the Austin Electric Light Company,) and the remaining $375,000 being negotiated in open market for full value,
the proceeds being expended in complying with the city's
direction, and that $50,000 of these last bonds were purchased
in open market for full value by Ogden and Robert Goelet,

Statement of the Case.

the last named complainants. The bill averred that the water
works thus originally established and extended were in every
respect entirely adequate to supply every want, not only of
all the inhabitants of the city of Austin, but of the municipality, and that in. each and every particular the municipality
was as advantageously placed with respect to a water supply
as it could have been under any condition or circumstance
whatever.
The bill 'hen alleged that, despite the existence of the contract, and the entire justness and fairness of each 'and every
obligation and stipulation 'therein contained, and without any
just reason therefor, the city of Austin, on the 31st day'of
March, 1890, passed an ordinance entitled "An ordinance
ordering an election to obtain the consent of the property tax
paying qualified voters of the city of Austin, to the extension
by the city council of the bonded indebtedness of the city of
Austin for the purposes of constructing a system of water
works and furnishing lights for the city of Austin." That
this ordinance provided that an election should be held on the
5th day of May, 1890, to obtain the consent of the taxpayers
for an increase of the bonded indebtedness of the city to the
amount of $1,400,000 for the purpose of obtaining money to
erect a system of water works and an electric light plant for
lighting the city; that on the 5th of May, 1896, the electiQn
was held, as provided, and the taxpayers gave their assent to
the proposition submitted by the ordinance, and that the city
council thereafter declared the election to have been carried,
and that the power to issue bonds had been sanctioned; that
on July 21, 1890, the city passed an ordinance authorizing the
increased issue of $1,400,000 of bonds, providing for the levy
and collection each year, as long as the bonds should be outstanding, of a tax to aid in paying the same. This ordinance
directed that the bonds on their fade should not only contain
a statement of the objects for which they were issueo, but
should also show that their payment was secured by all the
sums to be collected for the use of the water to be furnished
by the new plant, and the ordinance moreover contained a
provision guaranteeing that the rates to be charged for the
voL cxvI-44

OCTOBER TERM, f897.
Statement of the Case.

water to be furnished should be so regulated that their product would equal the sum of the interest on the bonds, and a
sinking fund to provide for the retirement of the principal
thereof. The money to be realized from the sale of the bonds
was required to be set apart in a distinct.fund, to be warranted
for from time to time in payment of the work as it progressed.
The character of the work to be done was moreover fixed by
an ordinance which empowered the board of public works to
construct water works by means of a dam across the Colorado
River at a designated point, in accordance with the plans.of a
civil engineer who was named therein.
It was alleged that as the purpose and necessary effect of
the foregoing action of the city was to impair the contract
rights of the Austin Water, Light and Power C6mpany held
by it as the assignee of the two original companies, the ordinances passed by the city and each and everything subsequently done thereunder was void because repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States. The bill moreover averred
that in April, 1891, the legislature of the - State of Texas
.passed an act giving a new charter to the city 6f Austin,
which contained an express gr.ant of power to that city to
construct for its own use a water works plant, and that the
sole object of this new charter was to sanction the action of
the municipality previously taken, and therefore the act in
question was also void under the Constitution of the United.
States, because it impaired the previous contract rights of the
Austin Water, Light and Power Company.
It was averred that the board of public works had "already
expended a large sum of money in the construction of a dam
across the Colorado River," and "are now actually laying
water pipe in and along the streets of the city of Austin, and
it is the avowed intention of the said city to press the construction of said rival system of water works to a speedy
completion, and upon the completion of the, same to discontinue the taking of water from the said water company, and
to refuse to perform any obligation resting upon the said city
as embraced in the said contract with the said city water company." It was alleged that the tax provided by the ordinance

PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANWCE CO. v. AUSTIN. '691
Statement of the Case.

which authorized the building of the new water works had
been levied for the years 1893 and 1894, and that the property of the Austin Water, Light and Power Company had
been assessed for this tax, and that the property of the company was thus being levied upon for a tax to be used for the
purpose of erecting the new works which were intended to
take the place of its plant, and thereby to destroy its contract
rights. Although the bill was filed by the complainants in
virtue of their rights as holders and owners of the bonds
issued or assumed by the Austin Water, Light and Power
Company as aforesaid, it contained no averment that either
the bondholders, who were complainants, or any others, had
at any previous time requested the trustee to take any action
so as to prevent the accomplishment of the violation of the
contract rights of the corporation and its bondholders, which
it was alleged had inevitably arisen from the action of the city
originating in 1890. The bill, however, contained the following averments:
"That as soon as the said city of Austin announced its
intention of constructing a rival system of water works, and
before anything was done in pursuance thereof, the said M. D.
Mathers, president of the Austin Water, Light and Power
Company, on behalf of the said water company and these
bondholders, remonstrated with the said mayor and city council, and requested them and urged them not to violate the said
contract, or to take any steps to depreciate the value of the
property of the said water company, but to exercise the right
which the said city has to'purchase the said works at their
appraised value; and the said bondholders have continued,
ever since that time, to remonstrate with the said city of
Austin and the officers thereof, but that the said city has
entirely disregarded the said remonstrances and requests, and
has openly repudiated all liability under the said contract."
And further the bill alleged:
"That your orators and the other bondholders of the said
water company have repeatedly applied to the said Austin
Water, Light and Power Company, and its president and
board of directors, and requested them to institute proceedings

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.

to protect the property of the said water company, and the
rights therein of the said bondholders; but that the said water
company has failed to comply with the request of your oratorsand said bondholders. 'But the said Austin Water, Light and
Power Company, and the officers thereof, by reason of the
contract relations existing between the said city of Austin and
the said company, fear that the consequences of any such
litigation instituted by the said Water Company, would be
exceedingly disastious and would precipitate adverse and hostile action by the said.city of Austin."
The relief asked. by the bill is thus 'stated in the prayer
thereof:
"That your orators may have the decree of your honorable
court, adjudging and decreeing that the said ordinance and
contract, so accepted and-acted upon by all the parties, are in
full force and effect, and that the said contract is a valid' and
subsisting contract, binding upon the said city as well as upon
the said water company and upon the said bondholders, and
that the said city must abide by and perform the same, and
that until its purchase of the said existing water works, in the
manner and upon the terms set forth in the said contract,
and that the said city of Austin, its mayor and city council
and board of public works, have no right or power to construct a river water works system to, in any way, intbrfere
with the rights of the said Austin Water, Light and Power
Company, and that it is unlawful and inequitable for the said
city of Austin to levy and collect the tax upon the property
of the said Austin Water, Light and Power Company to be
expended in the unlawful and inequitable manner herein before
alleged, in the construction of a rival system of water works;
and that a writ of.injunction -may issue out of this honorable
court restraining the said city of Austin, its mayor and city
council and board of public works, and its other officers, servants, agents and employ~s, from taking a supply of water,
from any othek source and from proceeding in constructing
and maintaining a new and distinct system of water works,
and from taking and appropriating to its own use, except in
the manner provided in said contract, any portion of the

said works, so constructed at its instance and for its benefit
with money furnished upon the faith of its obligation by the
said AustinWater, Light and Power Oompany and the said
bondholders, and that your orators may have sucl other and
further relief as the case may, in equity, require and as to this
honorable court may seem proper."
The demurrer which the lower court sustained, besides
asserting that the bill disclosed no cause for equitable relief,
rested upon seven grounds, which may be reduced to six, substantially as follows: 1st. Because by the constitution of
the State of Texas the contract made by the city of Austin
with the water company was void. 2d. Because the contract
was beyond the power of the corporation as defined in its
charter and as limited by the general laws of the State of
Texas. 3d. Because the commutation of taxation granted
to the water company was in its essence but an exemption,
and the city was without power, under the constitution of the
State of Texas, to grant it. 4th. Because even if aft exclusive
right was given to the water company, such grant under the
coristitution and laws of the State of Texas was subject to
alteration, amendment or repeal by the legislature which had*
exercised such reserved power. 5th. Because the. granting
of any exclusive rights was forbidden by the constitution
which was in force at the time the alleged contract was made.
6th. Because even if the complainants had any contract rights,
and if there had been an impairment thereof, full and adequate remedy was afforded by an action at law,:and there was,
hence, no reason for the interposition of a court of equity.

MR.

The jurisdiction of this court to review the decree of the

Opinion of the Court.

from the decision of the trial court was desired, it should have
been had in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and cannot be here
obtained.
By the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat.
826, creating the Circuit Courts of Appeals, jurisdiction is conferred upon this court to review by direct appeal any final judgment rendered by the Circuit Court "in any case in which the
constitution or law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States." There can
be no doubt that the case at bar comes within this provision.
The complainants in their bill in express terms predicated their
right to the relief sought upon the averment that certain
ordinances adopted by the municipal authorities of the city of
Austin, and an act of the legislature of the State of Texas
referred to in the bill, impaired the obligations of the contract
which the bill alleged had been entered into with the complainants by the city of Austin, and that both the law of the
State of Texas and the city ordinances were in contravention
of the Constitution of the United States. No language could
more plainly bring a case -within the letter of a statute than
do these allegations of the bill bring this case within the law
of 1891.
Not only were the averments of the bill,, as to- the invalidity of the state law adequate, but so also were the allegations as to the nullity of the, city ordinances. These ordi-.
nances were but the exercise by the city of a legislative power
which it assumed had been delegated to it by the State, and
were, therefore, in legal intendment the equivalent of laws
enacted by the State itself. City Railway Co. v. Citizeni'
Street Rail'oad Co., 166 U. S. 557, and cases there cited.
The 'argument by .which it is sought to support the contention
that a right to review the case by direct appeal does not
exist, not only disregards the letter of the statute, but is
unsound in reason. It says that the right to the direct appeal
can alone rest on the proposition, "That the constitution or a
law of the State of Texas conflicts with appellant's contract,
and contravenes the Federal Constitution; in other words, it
must affirmatively appear upon the face of complainant's bill

PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. AUSTIN,

695

Opinion of the Court.

that there was involved in this case a Federal question, the
determination of which was essential to a correct decision of
the case." But the words of the statute, which empower this
court to review directly the action of the Circuit Court, are
that such power shall exist wherever it is claimed on the
record that a law of a State is in contravention of the Federal
Constitution. Of course, the claim must be real and colorable,
not fictitious and fraudulent. The contention here made,
however, is, not that the bill, without color of right, alleges
that the state law and city ordinances violate the Constitution
of the United States, but that such claim as alleged in the bill
is legally unsound.
The argument, then, in effect, is that
the right to a direct appeal to this court does not exist where
it is claimed that a state law violates the Constitution of the
United States, unless the claim be well founded. But it cannot be decided whether the claim is meritorious and should
be maintained without taking jurisdiction of the case. The
authorities referred to as supporting the position indicate that
the argument is the result of a confusion of thought, and that
it arises from confounding the power of this court to review
on a writ of error the action of a state court with the power
exercised by this court, under the act of 1891, to review by
direct appeal the final action of the Circuit Court where, on
the face of the record, it appears that the claim was made
that the statute of a State contravened the Constitution of the
United States. These classes of jurisdiction are distinct in
their nature, and are embraced in different stat utory provisions. Having jurisdiction of the cause, there exists the
power to consider'every question arising on the record. Horner v. United Sta48, 143 U. S. 570.
Conceding, without deciding, the legality and binding force
of the contract as averred in the bill, and that'the obligations
which it created were materially impaired, not only by a law
of the S tate of Texas, but also by the ordinances passed by the
city, and the execution of such ordinances, all as alleged;
conceding, moreover, without so deciding, that the Austin
Water, Light and Power Company was the successor in law
of the original corporations, and hence responsible for all

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

their obligations and entitled to all their rights; and, further,
conceding that the complainants as bondholders have the capacity to assert the impairment of the contract made by the city
of Austin with the City Water Company, it yet becomes at
the outset necessary to decide whether granting, arguendo,all
these propositions, the complainants are entitled to the relief
which they seek, that is to say, whether they can be heard to
invoke the interposition of a court of equity. -As a prerequisite to the solution of this question, it is necessary to determine precisely the remedy which it is the purpose of the bill
to obtain in order to redress the wrongs which it alleged to
exist. Whilst the prayer of the bill asks that the validity of
the contract be recognized, and whilst it also prays that the
legality of the commutation of taxation created by the city
ordinance be decreed, these prayers are made but the foundation.or premise for the real relief which the bill invokes; that
is, the exercise of the power to enjoin in order thereby to
perpetually restrain the city of Austin from completing the
water works, by it commenced, and from levying on the property of the Austin Water, Light and Power Company any
taxation to be used to complete the new water works. The
preliminary inquiry, therefore, is whether the complainants
have so exercised their rights as to entitle them to prevent the
city from completing the water works.
In Speidel v. i-enrii, 120 U. S. 377, 387, the court said,
speaking through Mr. Justice Gray:
"Independently of any statute of limitations, courts of
equity uniformly decline to assist a person who has slept upon
his rights and shows no excuse for his laches in asserting
them. ' A court of equity,' said Lord Camden, 'has always
refused its aid to stale demands, where the party slept upon
his. rights, and acquiesced for. a great length .of time. Nothing can call forth this court into activity but conscience, good
faith and reasonable diligence; where these are wanting, the
court is passive and does nothing. Laches and neglect are
always discountenanced; and, therefore, from the beginning of
this jurisdiction there was always a limitation to suits in this
court.'"'

PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. AUSTIN.

697

Opinion of the Court.

In Galliher v. Oadwell, 145 U. S. 368, 371, speaking through
Mr. Justice Brewer, it was said:
"The question of laches turns not simply upon the number
of years which have elasped between the accruing of her
rights, whatever they were, and her assertion of them, but
also upon the nafure and evidence of those rights, the changes
in value, and other circumstances occurring during the lapse
of years, The cases are many in which this defence has been
invoked and considered. It is true that by reason of their
differences of fact no one case becomes an exact precedent for
another, yet a uniform principle pervades them all."
In Hammond v. Hopkins, 143 U. S. 224, 250, through Mr.
Chief Justice Fuller, the court said:
. "No rule of law is better:settled than that a court
of equity
will not aid a party whose application is destitute of conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence, but will discourage stale demands for the peace of pociety, by refusing to
interfere where there have been gross laches in prosecuting
rights, or where long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse
rights has occurred."
In Willard v. Ioods, 164 U. S. 502, 524, the court said:
"But the recognized doctrine of courts of equity to withhold relief from those who have delayed the assertion of their
claims for an unreasonable length of time may be applied in
the discretion of the court, even though the laches are ot
pleaded or the bill demurred to. Sullivan v. Portland &
"Xennebec Railroad,94 U. S. 806, 811; Lansdale v. Smith, 106
U. S. 391, 394; Badger*v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 95."
In Lane & Bodley Co. v. Locke, 150 U. S. 193, and .Mackall v. Cassilear,137 U. S. 556, it was held that the mere assertion of a claim, unaccompanied with any act to give effect to
the asserted right, could not avail to keep. alive a right which.
would otherwise be precluded because of laches. Indeed, the
principle by which a court of equity declines to exert its
powers tb relieve one who has been guilty of laches as expressed in the foregoing decisions has been applied by this
court in so many cases besides those above referred to as to.
render the doctrine elementary. Whitney v. Fox, 166 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

637, 647, 648; Gildersleeve v. NSew .Mexico Mining Co., 161
U. S. 573, 582; Abraham v. Ordway, 158 U. S. 416, 423;
Ware v. Galveston City Co., 146 U. S. 102, 116; Foster v.
Ma'sfield, Cold Water etc. Railroad, 146 U. S. 88, 102;
Galliher v. Cadwell, supra, where the earlier cases are fully

138 U. S. 486, 495; Richards v. Maekall 124 U. S. 183, 189.
The reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the
lapse of time during which the neglect to enforce the right
has existed, but the changes of condition which may have
arisen during the period in which there has been neglect. In
other words, where a court of equity finds that the position of
the parties has so changed that equitable relief cannot be
afforded without doing injustice, or that the intervening rights
of third persons may be destroyed or seriously impaired, it
will not exert its equitable powers in order to save one from
the consequences of his own neglect. The adjudicated cases,
as said in Galliher v. Cadwell, supra, 372, "proceed dn the
assumption that the party to whom laches is imputed has
knowledge of his rights, and an ample opportunity to establish
them in the proper forum; that by reason of his delay the
adverse party has good reason to believe that the alleged
rights are worthless or have been abandoned; and that, because of the change in condition or relations during this period
of delay,.it would be an injustice to the latter to permit him
now to assert them." The requirement of diligence, and the
loss of the right to ihvoke the arm of a court of equity in case
of laches, is particularly applicable where the subject-matter
of the controversy is a public work. In a case of this nature,
where a public expenditure has been made, or a public work
undertaken, and where one, having full opportunity to prevent
its accomplishment, has stood by and seen the public work
proceed, a court of equity will more readily consider laches.
The equitable doctrine in this regard is somewhat analogous
to the legal rule which holds that where one who has the
title in fee to real estate, although he has not been compensated, "remains inactive and permits them (a railway company) to go on and expend large sums in the work, he will be

As said in Galliher v. Cadwel, supra, 373: "But it is unnecessary to multiply cases. They all proceed upon the
theory that laches is not, like limitation, a mere matter of
time; but principally a question of the inequity of permitting
the claim to be enforced-an inequity founded upon some
change in the condition or relations of the property or the
parties."
'Do the facts in the case before us bring it within the rule
of laches as expounded in the foregoing authorities? The
rights of the water company, under its contract, were created
long prior to the year 1890. Before that year the water works
plant was constru~ted, and from it the inhabitants of the city
of Austin were being supplied with water. The violation of
the contract relied upon as impairing its obligations originated
in 1890. The first step was the passage of an ordinance submitting to the voters of the city of Austin the proposition
whether the bonded debt of the municipality should be increased by the issue of $1,400,000 of negotiable bonds, the
proceeds arising from the sale of such bonds to be used in
erecting the new water work9. There was nothing clandestine in the conduct of the municipality, since its action was
dependdnt on a municipal election. The holding of the municipal election followed, and, after it had taken place, occurred
the passage of the ordinance, directing the issue of the new
bonds, and providing that they were to be secured by the
water rates tobe collected from the new water works which
were to be constructed. From the time of the submission to
the vote, and of the ordinances issuing the bonds and directing the work to be done, all in 1890, until this bill was filed in
1895, no legal steps whatever appear by the bill to have been
taken to prevent the consummation of the wrong which the
bill alleges was necessarily to result from the action of the
municipal authorities. During all this period it does not
appear from the bill that the trustee representing the bond-

Opinion of the Court.-

holders was ever called upon by them to take any steps whatever to protect their interest. it cannot be said that the
bondholders were ignorant of the action and purposes of the
city of Austin, since the bill avers that, conscious of the fact
that their rights were to be impaired by the action of the city,
they repeatedly called upon the Austin Water, Light and
Power Company to take action on the subject, but that that
corporation refused so to do, and that the bondholders continued to object to the proposed action of the city without
doing anything whatever to protect their legal rights. The
bill alleges the issue by the municipal authorities of the series
of bonds provided for, since it says, in referring to the tax
levied upon the property' of the Austin Water, Light and
Power Company, that for the purpose "of providing for the
interest and sinking fund on the bonds of the said city of
Austin, issued for said purpose," (that is, the new water works,)
"the said city of Austin has levied a tax. . . ." The exact
amount of the new bonds which have been issued is not
specifically set out in the bill, but it is inferable from the allegations, to which we have just referred, that the whole
series have been issued by the city, since the bill alleges that
the taxation has been levied for the purpose of paying the
bonds provided by the ordinance. Moreover, that either
the whole or a large portion of the bonds have been issued is
plainly deducible from other averments in the bill. The ordinance, which is an exhibit to the bill, provides that to pay
for the work proposed the bonds should be discounted from
time to time as required by the necessities of the*situation,
that the proceeds arising from their sale should be put to a
special fund, and be warranted against by the proper city
officer to pay for the work. And the bill avers that the city
at great expense has nearly completed a costly dam across
the Colorado River as a part of the work provided. The
bill therefore- presents a case where there has arisen during
the existence of the delay a material change in the situation
of the parties, and besides is one where rights of third parties
have intervened. It cannot be said, under.the case made by
the bill, that the power of a court of equity can be exerted to

Opinion- of the Court.

forbid the finishing of the water works structure, which the
bill alleges has been largely completed, without seriously impairing the rights of the bondholders under the ordinances in
question. One of the methods of payment stipulated, as we
have seen, for these bonds was the revenue to be derived from
the new water works, and&of course no sich revenues can
ever result if the water works are never to be"finished. It is
certain, then, that if the completion of the new water works
be restrained by an injunction, that the interest of the new
bondholders will b5 seriously affected, and that this result
will be brought about by a decree of a court of equity rendered
in the enforcement of asserted rights of complainants, who, if
they had taken timely action, could have adequately protected
themselves from injury without resulting wrong to the rights
of many other persons.
It being clear under such circumstances that the complainants were not entitled to the relief which they sought, it of
course follows that
The court below did not err in sustaining the demurrer and
dismissing the bill for 'want of equity. We think, however, that the.dismissal should have been without prejudice,
and the decree below is therefore modified in that particular, and a's so modified, it is affirmed.
