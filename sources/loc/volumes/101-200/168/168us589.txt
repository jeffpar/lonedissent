Statement of the Case.

MICHIGAN LAND AND LUMBER COMPANY v.
RUST.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 57. Argued October 25, 26, 169T. -Decided

December 18, 1897.

The act of September 28, 1850, c. 84, granting swamp lands to the several
States, was a grant in prmsenti, passing title to all lands which at that
date were swamp lands, but leaving to the Secretary of the Interior to
determine and identify what lands were, and what lands were not,
swamp lands.
Whenever the granting act specifically provides for the issue of a patent,
the legal title-remains in the Government until its issue, with power to
Inquire into the extent and validity of rights claimed against the Government.
Although a survey had been made of the lands in controversy which indicated that they were -swamp lands, it was within the power of the land
office at any time prior to the issue of a patent to order a resurvey and
to correct mistakes made in the prior survey.
The facts in this case clearly show an adjustment of the grant upon the
basis of the resurveys, and their acceptance by the officer of the State
charged by the act of Congress with the duty of so doing, and this
makes such adjustment final and conclusive.
The act of March 3, 1857, c. 117, did not operate to confirm to the State of
Michigan the title to all lands marked on the approved and certified list
of January 13, 1854, as swamp and overflowed lands, and direct the
issue of a patent or patents therefor, but it simply operated to accept
the field notes fiaally approved as evidence of the- lands lassing under
the grant, leaving to the land department to make any needed corrections in the surveys and field notes.
The decision in Martin v. Marks, 97 U. S. 345, doe not conflict with this
construction of the act of 1857.

THIS was an action of ejectment commenced in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan on February .11, 1888. On November 28, 1892, the case
came on for trial before the court and a jury. At the close
of the testimony the jury, under the instructions of the court,
returned a verdict for the defendants. On May 7, 1895, this
judgment was affirmed by. the Court of Appeals, 31 U. S.
App. 731, and to review such judgment the case was brought

here on writ of error. The land in dispute is situated in
Clare County, being the S. E. oof S. E. j of sec. 20 ; N. W.
jofS. W. Iofsec. 21; N. W. of S. E. of sec. 22; N.W.

I of sec. 1, township 18, range & W., and amounting to 400
acres, the undivided half of which only was claimed by plaintiff.
The contention of the plaintiff, generally speaking, is that
this was swamp land, and granted to the State of Michigan
by the act of Congress of date September 28, 1850, c. 84, 9.
Stat. 519, granting swamp lands to the several States; thiat it
was included in a list of such lands in -the Ionia land district,
approved by the Secretary of the Interior and forwarded to
the governor of Michigan on January 13, 1854: ; that the act
of March 3, 1857, c. 117, 11 Stat. 251, confirmed the action of
the Secretary of the Interior, *andthereby passed the title to
the' State of Michigan, by which State it was, on October 14,
1887, conveyed to plaintiff's grantor.
The, defendants, on the other hand, contend that the original surveys of the public lands in the State of Michigan were
erroneous; that, at 'the instance of the State, Congress
ordered resurveys, which resurveys were carried on from the
years 1842 to 1857; that, while it- is true this land was by
original surveys classed as swamp land and included in
the Ionia land district list approved and certified to the State
of Michigan, the resurveys showed that it was not land of
that description; that a new list for that district, not including this land, was in 1866 made out and certified to the State;
that such new list was accepted by the State as correct, and a
patent for the lands described therein issued to and rbceived.
by it; that after all this had taken place and in 1870 the land
in question was sold by the officers of -the United States at
auction after public advertisement and that patents were
duly issued upon such sale, under which patents the defendants claim title.

BEEwER, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
MR. JUSTi-.

This case involves questions of the power of the land department over the matter of the identification of the particular lands pasing under the swamp land act of 1850, of the
finality of the action of the Secretary of the Interior in
ipproving and certifying to the Governor of the State a list
of such lands, and of the effect of the confirmatory act of
1857. There is no testimony showing what was in fact the
condition of the land, whether swamp or not, at the time of
the passage of the act of 1850, and the case turns wholly upon
the documentary evidence.
The act of 1850 made a grant in pcesenti; in other words,
the title then*passed to all lands which at that date were
swamp lands, and the only matters thereafter to be considered were those of identification. Railroad Company v.
Smith, 9 Wall. 95; French v. Fyan, 93 U. S. 160; .Martin v.
Mark8, 97 U. S. 345 ; Rice v. Sioux City & t. Paul Railroad,
110 U. S.' 695; tWright v. Roseberry, 121 U. S. 488; Tubb8 v.
ilhoit, 138 U.S. 134. But while the act operated as a grant
in prwsenti, the determination of what lands were swamp
lands was entrusted to the Secretary of the Interior. Section
2 contains this provision:
"That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior,
as soon as may be practicable after the passage of this act, to
make out an accurate list and plats of the lands described as
aforesaid, and transmit the same to the governor of the.State
of Arkansas, and, at the request of said governor, cause a
patent to be issued to the State therefor;, and on that patent,
the fee simple to said lands shall vest in said State of Arkansas, subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof."

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

It may be remarked in passing that while the first and
second sections refer specifically to the State of Arkansas,
section 4 of the act makes it applicable to all the States. It
is true that in the first section Congress' defines the lands
granted as "swamp and overflowed lands, made unfit thereby
for cultivation;" and section 3, referring to the lists and plats
ordered by section 2 to be made out by the Secretary of the
Interior, contains this further specification as to the character
of the lands granted:
"That in making out a list and plats of the lands aforesaid,
all legal subdivisions, the greater part of which is ' wet and
unfit for cultivation,' shall be included in said list and plats;
but when the greater part of a subdivision- is not of that-character, the whole of it shall be excluded therefrom."
But while Congress .thus defined what it intended to grant
as swamp and overflowed lands it entrusted, as appears from
section 2, the identification of those lands to the Secretary of
the Interior.
It will be perceived that the act contemplated the issue of
a patent as the means of transferring the legal title. In Rogers
Locomotivd Works v. American Emigrant Co., 164 U. S.559,
574, it was said, speaking in reference to this matter, and after
a full review of the previous authorities: "When he" (that is,
the Secretary of the Interior) "made such identification, then,
and not before, the State was entitled to a patent, and 'on.
such patent' the fee simple title vested in .the 'State. The
State's title was at the outset an inchoate one, and did ot
become perfect, as of the date of the act, until a patent was
issued."
Generally speaking, while the legal title remains in the
United States, the grant is in process of administration and
the land is subject to the jurisdiction of the land department
of the Government. It is true a patent is not always necessary for the transfer of the legal title. Sometimes an act of
Congress will pass the fee. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Pet. 410,
454; Grignon's Lessee v. Astor, 2 How. 319; khouteau, v.
Eckhart, 2 How. 344, 372; Glasgow v: Ilortiz, 1 Black, 595 ;
Langdeau v. Hanes, 21 Wall. 521; Ryan v. Garter, 93 U. S.

MICHIGAN LAND AN ) LUMBER CO. v. RUST.

Opinion of the Court.

78. Sometimes a certification of a list of lands.to the grantee
is declared to be operative to transfer such title, Rev. Stat.
2449; Frasherv. O'Connor,115 U. S. 102; but wherever the
granting act specifically provides for the issue of a patent,
then the rule is that the legal title remains in the Government
until the issue of the patent, Bagnell v. Broderick, 13 Pet. 436,
450 ; and while so remaining the grant is in process of administration , and the jurisdiction of the land department is not
lost.
It is, of course, not pretended that when an equitable title
has passed the land department has power to arbitrarily
destroy that equitable title. It has jurisdiction, however,
after proper notice to the party claiming such equitable title,
and upon a hearing, to determine the question whether or
not such title has passed. Cornelius v. .Kessel, 128 U. S. 456;
Orchard v. Alexander, 157 U. S.372, 383; Parsonsv. Fenzke,
164: U. S. 89. In other words, the power of the department
to inquire into the extent and validity of the rights claimed
against the Government does not cease until the legal title
has passed. "A warrant and survey authorize the proprietor
of them to demand the legal title, but do not, in themselves,
constitute a legal title. Until the consummation of the title
by a grant, the person who acquires an equity holds a right
subject to examination." Miller v. Kerr, 7 Wheat. 1, 6.
After the issue of the patent the matter becomes subject to
inquiry only in the courts and by judicial proceedings. United
States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 535; Joore v. .Robbins,96 U. S.530;.
United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S.378, 396; Bicknell v. Corstock, 113 U. S.149, 151 ; Iron Silver .Xining Co.v. Campobell,
135 U. S. 286; Williams v. United States, 138 U. S. 514.
This jurisdiction of 'the depariment has been maintained in
cases of preemption where the entire purchase money has
been paid and a receiver's final certificate issued. Orchardv.
Alexander, 157 U. S. 372, and cases cited in the opinion;
Parsons v. Venzke, 164 U. S. 89.
In iEnight v. United States Land Association, 142 U. S.161,

Secretary of the Interior over proceedings in respect to the

Opinion of the Court.

dispbsition of public lands; and on page 178 it is said, as illustrative of the scope of that power: "For example, if, when a
patent is about to issue, the Secretary should discover a fatal
defect in the proceedings, or that by reason of some newly
ascertained fact the patent, if issued, would have to be annulled, and that it would be his duty to ask the Attorney
General to institute proceedings for its annulment, it would
hardly be seriously contended that the Secretary might not
interfere and prevent the execution of the patent. He could
not be obliged to sit quietly and allow a proceeding to be
consummated, which it would be immediately his duty to ask
the Attorney General to take measures to annul." And,
again, on page 181 is this language: "The Secretary is the
guardian of the people of the United States over the public
lands. The obligations of his oath of office oblige him to see
that the law is carried out, and that none of the public domain
is wasted or is disposed of to a party not entitled to it. He
represents the Government, which is a party in interest in
every case involving the surveying and disposal of the public
lands." See also Orchard v. Alexander, 157 U. S. 372, 381,
382; Wrarner 'Valley Stock Company v. Smith, 165 U. S. 28,
34. This jurisdiction extends to the ordering of new surveys
whenever in the judgment of, the department there has been
error or fraud in those already made. -Cragin v. Powell, 128
U. S. 691. In Tubas v. Wilhoit, 138 U. S. 134, 143, the court.
quoted with approval this passage from a letter of the Secretary of the Interior: " There can be no doubt but that under
the act of July 4, 1836, reorganizing the general land office,
the Commissioner has general supervision over all surveys,
and that authority is exercised whenever error or fraud is
alleged on the part of the surveyor general." And in _rew
Orleans v. Paine,147 U. S. 261,- the question was presented
as to the power of the department to order a new survey, and
on page 266 the rule was thus stated: "If the department
was not satisfied with this survey, there was no rule of law
standing in the way of its ordering another, Until the matter
is closed by final action, the proceedings of an officer of a
department are as much open to review or reversal by himself,

Opinion of the Court.

or his successor, as are the interlocutory decrees of a court
open to review upon the final hearing." So, notwithstanding
that a survey had been made and that such survey indicated
that the land in controversy was swamp land, and, therefore,
passing under the act of 1850 to the State of Michigan, it was
within the power of the land department, at any time prior to
the issue of a patent, of its own motion, to order a resurvey,
and correct by that any mistakes in the prior survey.
But in this case it is not necessary to rely alone on the general power vested in the land department, for as early as 1842
the attention of the legislature of Michigan was called to the
fact that thdre had been errors in the surveys of public lands
within the State, and a resolution was passed by it in these
words:
"Whereas, it has been satisfactorily made to appear to this
legislature that large districts of lands lying within the limits
of the State of Michigan have been returned by some of the
deputy United States surveyors to the general land office
as surveyed, where no surveys whatever have been made, or
where the surveys have been so imperfectly done as to be
utterly valueless; and whereas, the United States surveyor
general of this land district has caused the lands so represented
as surveyed to be offered for sale, to the very great injury of
the State of Michigan and the citizens thereof ; therefore,
"Be it ,resolvedby the Senate and House of Representatives
of the State of M1ichigan, That the President of the United
States be requested to cause the subdivisions. of the following townships of land, situate within the State of Michigan,
and which have been represented to have been surveyed, but
which have either not been surveyed or have been so imperfectly surveyed that said work is valueless, to be surveyed at
as early a day as may be consistent, viz.:
"Resolved, 'That the governor be requested to transmit the
foregoing preamble and resolution to the President of the
United States." Laws Mich. 1842, No. 8.
A letter, enclosing a copy of this resolution, was forwarded
to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and by him

referred to the President, who endorsed it as follows: "Let
the matter be referred to the surveyor general, with instructions as indicated, and let the Governor of Michigan be
informed of the measures to be adopted." Thereupon proceedings for new surveys were taken by the land department,
of which fact the Governor of the State was duly informed.
It is true that in the resolutions of the Michigan legislature
81 townships were specifically named, and that the land in
controversy was not included within those townships, but it
appears that on the strength of the information thus furnished
the land department proceede.d to make new surveys of other
lands than those specifically mentioned by the legislature, and
the attention of Congress having been called to the matter, it
from 1845 to 1856 inclusive made appropriations for correcting surveys in the State of Michigan. Act of March 3, 1845,
c. 71, 5 Stat. 752, 762; Act of August 10, 1846, c. 175, 9 Stat.
85, 95 ; Act of March 3, 1849, c. 100, 9 Stat. 354, 365; Act
of September 30, 1850, c. 90, 9 Stat..523, 530; Act of March
3, 1851, c. 32, 9 Stat. 598, 611, 612; Act of March 3, 1853, c.
97, 10 Stat. 189, 204; Act of August 4, 1854, c. 242, 10 Stat.
546, 565; Act of March 3, 1855, c. 175, 10 Stat. 643, 660; Act
of August 18, 1856, c. 129, 11 Stat. 81, 86. The last three
appropriations were made after the sending of the approved
list for the Ionia land district to the Governor on January 13,
1854.
It may be noticed here, in passing, that in the adjustmeilt
of the swamp la-hd grant for the State of Michigan the land
department did not include in one list all the swamp lands
within the State, but made out several lists, apparently one at
least for each land district.
N'ot only was there general knowledge on the part of the
authorities of the State, as of those at Washington, of the
existence of errors and mistakes. in the original surveys of
public lands in the State of Michigan, but also was there
particular information as to supposed errors in the surveys of
the land in controversy. After the passage of the act of 1850
the Commissioner of the general land office instructed the
surveyor general of the State of Michigan to examine the

MICHIGAT LAND AND LUMBER 00. v. RUST.

597

Opinion of the Court.

field notes of the surveys on file in his office and report therefrom a list of the lands which were swamp or overflowed.
From time to time the surveyor general forwarded to the land
department lists in accordance with these instructions. On
M[arch 29, 1852, he forwarded a list containing the land in
question, and in the letter accompanying is found this language: "The districts reported by Judge Burt and Hiram
Burnham to be fraudulent are embraced in thislist and marked
'IF'," and in that list the district containing the land in controversy is marked with the letter "F," so that ipon the records
of the general land office was to be found information that
the survey of this particular land was reported to be erroneous,
and as such was likely to be included in resurveys then pending. The report of the commissioner of the state land office
to the legislature of the State, for the year ending November
30, 1856, contains this statement: "Patents are'now received
for all these lands in the. State except those situate in the
Ionia land district, .comprising about 1,200,000 acres, and for
these we are assured the patents will soon be forwarded, the
making of which have been delayed in consequence of extensive resurveys by the General Government, which, in some
instances, changes the amount and character of the land."
And again, after speaking of the application for the purchase
of particular tracts, he says they have been -denied, because
"no valid sale could be, made until after a compliance with
the law requiring advertisement of a public offering to be
published in each county of the State; and such public sale
or offering has not been deemed advisable until after the title
of the State to the grant should be Nvholly confirmed by the
issue of the patents, and the numerous corrections and restatements of the lists necessary to be previously made by the
department at Washington."
And still again: "It is well
known that many tracts, and sometimes almost entire sections,
are now considered as among the best of farming lands, or
extensively covered with pine and other valuable timber."
Upon the resurveys the land in controversy was shown not
to be swamp and overflowed land, and lists conforming to
these new surveys were duly approved and certified by the

Opinion of the Court.

Secretary of the Interior and-forwarded to the Governor of the
State of Michigan; the receipt of such lists was acknowledged
-and a request made for patents for the lands described therein,
and patents were issued and accepted conveying such lands.
These facts indicate very clearly an adjustment of the grant
upon the basis of the resurveys. - Undoubtedly the beneficiary
of such a grant is interested in its adjustment and ]'Jay properly
be heard before the officers of the grantor in determining
what lands are embraced within it, and any assent by the
grantee to a determination made by the officers of the grantor
as to the lands passing within the grant would be binding
upon it, In this case the grant was for the benefit of the
State of Michigan, but in the act of 1850 making the grant,
Congress,.as it had a iight to do, clearly indicated the officer of
the State, to wit, the Governor, whose action in the premises
should be the action of the grantee. Under these circumstances, it being known that there were errors in the surveys,
and the legislature of the State having requested action"to be
taken to correct these errors, and resuiveys having been undertaken, and while they were being prosecuted for the purpose
of correcting such errors, a list of lands, which by the original
surveys appeared to be swamp and overflowed, was made out
and forwarded to the Govern6r. Upon the records of the
land department the. original survey of the district containing
the land in controversy was at that time challenged as fraudulent. After the list containiqg this land had been forwarded
b the Governor and his request for a patent returned to the
land department, a patent was issued not including this land.
Subsequently the resurveys were finished and according to
them this land was excluded from the grant. Thereupon a
new and corrected list containing the lands, which by the resurveys were shown to be swamp and overflowed, was made
out, approved by the Secretaiy of the Interior and forwarded
to the Governor. 'Upon its receipt the Governor requested
patents to be issued, and patents were issued conveying the
lands specified therein. This clearly shows an acceptance by
the officer of the State, charged under the act of Congress
with the duty of so doing, of the resurveys as within the

MICHIGAN LAND AND LUMBER CO. v. RUST.

Opini6n of the Court.
authority of the land department, and makes the adjustment
of the grant upon the basis of such resurveys final and
conclusive. The act of the State in accepting the new and
corrected survey as the basis of adjustment is tantamount to
a waiver of any claims under the prior and erroneous survey,
for it cannot be that a grantee accepting a. patent for lauds
which according to a final and correct survey are shown to be
within the terms of the grant can thereafter be heard to
say, Notwithstanding I have taken all the lands shown to
belong to me by this correct survey, I also claim lands
which by a prior and erroneous, if not fraudulent survey,
appeared to pass under the grant. He cannot in that way
enlarge the scope of the grant, and after taking lands which
are finally determined to pass under the grant say, I also
insist upon lands which upon such -nal survey are shown not
to be within the grant, simply because under. a prior erroneous
survey they appeared to be within its terms.
We come now to consider the effect of the act of March 3,
1857, c. 117, 11 Stat. 251, which provided:
"That the selection of swamp and overflowed lands granted
to the several States by the act of Congress . . . heretofore made and reported to the commissioner of the general
land office, so far as the same shall remain vacant and unappropriated, and not interfered with by an actual settlement
under any existing law of the United States, be and the same
are hereby confirmed, and shall be approved and patented to
the said several States, in conformity with the provisions of
the act aforesaid, as soon- as may be practicable after the passage of this law: Provided, however, That nothing in this act
contained shall interfere with the provisions of the act of Congress entitled ' An act for the relief of purchasers and locators
of swamp and overflowed lands,' approved March the second,
eighteen hundred and fifty-five, which shall be and is hereby
continued in force, and extended to all entries and locations of
lands olaimed as swamp lands made since its passage."
It is contended by the plaintiff that the purpose and effect
of this act were to coifirm to the State of Michigan the title
to all lands marked on the approved and certified list of Jan-

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion'of the Court.

uary 13, 1854, as swamp and overflowed lands, and to direct
the issue of a patent or patents therefor. Whatever question
might have existed, were it not for this act, as to whether any
of the lands marked on such lists were swamp and overflowed
lands, and whatever authority there might otherwise be in the
land department to make corrections, Congress, which had
full power overthe matter, by it in teims granted to the State
these lands; such action by Congress was a finality; thereafter no inquiry could be made as to the character of the
lands; no correction of the list; and the full equitable title
passed to the State, beyond the possibility of challenge. It
is insisted that Congress inust have known of the alleged

irregularities in the surveys; known of the approval by the
Secretary of the Interior of this list; that it had been forwardea 'to the Governor; that the Governor had accepted
and requested .the issue of patents; and with this knowledge
passed this act, intending thereby to remove all question as to
the character of the lands, to put an erd to the necessity for
any further examination, and to make this list the single and
absolute evidence of the lands it was granting to the State of
Michigan. There would be force in this contention if the act
of 1850 contained simply a grant to the State of M'ichigan,
and there were but a single list of swamp lands in that State.
It might then well be said that this act was passed with
reference solely to the conditions existing in respect to this
attempted selection of swamp and overflowed lands in that
State, but the act of 1850 was a grant to all the States, and
the act of 1857 must, therefore, be construed as applicable to
the conditions existing in all of the States. It is contended
by the defendants that it applies only to those States in which
the state authorities had attempted to make selections of
swamp and overflowed lands within their limits, and had communicated such selections to the land department, and that its
purpose was simply to confirm to the States lists which constituted selections made by them, and with reference to which
the Secretary of the Interior had delayed and neglected to
act ; and they refer to the opinion of this court in Tubbs v.
Wilheit, 138 U. S.131, 137, in which it is said:

MICHIGAN LAND AND LUMBER CO. v. RUST.

601

Opinion of the Court.

"In consequence of the delays in certifying the lists and
the inconveniences which followed, the legislatures of several
States, in which such lands existed, undertook to identify the
lands and dispose of them, and for that purpose passed various
acts for their survey and sale and the issue of patents to purchasers. The conflicts which thus arose between parties
claiming under the 'State and parties claiming directly from.
the United States led to various acts of Congress for the
relief of purchasers and locators of swamp and overflowed
lands. Act of March 2, 1855, 10 Stat. 634, c. 147; act of
March 3, 1857, 11 Stat. 251, c. 117."
This argument is entitled to consideration because the word
"selection" applies more naturally to the action of the
grantee in reporting to the land department the lands -which
it claims, than to the action of the land officers in identifying
from the field notes what are and what are not swamp and
overflowed lands. The term "selection" is not an apt word
to describe the identification of certain lands according to
evidence presented of their character. But we need not rest
on this. Conceding that the statute applies not merely to
those cases in-which affirmative action had been taken by the
States, but also to those in which without any such action the
only proceedings had been those in the land department of
the United States, still we think that it cannot be held that
this act is to be construed as expressing a purpose to make the
list in this case, approved and certified to the State, a finality
as to the lands passing under the grant and an absolute transfer of the equitable title.
In order to fully understand the matter attention must be
called to the act of 1850. That granted, as has been seen,
swamp and overflowed lands, and directed the Secretary of
the Interior, as soon as practicable, to make an accurate list
and plats of such lands and transmit the same to the Governor, an. thereafter, at his request, cause a patent to be issued.
The manner in which the Secretary should discharge this
duty, the evidence that should be required by him as to the
character of the lands, were not prescribed by the act; the
matter was left to his discretion. The Secretary sent out

instructions to the surveyor general of the State of Michigan
to make lists of the unsold swamp lands, as shown by the
field notes on file in his office. From these instructions we
quote this passage : "The only reliable data in your possession, from which these lists can be made out, are the field
notes of the surveys on file in your office, and if the authorities of the State are willing to adopt these as the basis of
those lists, you will so regard them; if not, and those authorities .furnish you satisfactory evidence that any-lands are of
the character embraced by the grant, you will so report
them." On receipt of a letter' containing notice of this from
the surveyor general the Governor replied that he did not
have authority to incur any expense in the matter, and afterwards referred it by message t6 the legislature, which body,
by act passed June 28, 1851, Laws of Michigan, 1851, p. 322,
adopted the surveys on file in the surveyor general's office as
the basis of adjustment. The effect of this legislative action
was not to make an erroneous survey conclusive nor to preclude the land department from the exercise of its unquestioned jurisdiction to correct surveys, but simply to accept the
field notes finally approved as the evidence of the lands passing under the grant, leaving to the land department to make
any needed corrections in the surveys and field notes. In
other States different action was taken by the state authorities, as appears from the opinion of this court in Tubbs v. WTIhoit, supra. Now, the obvious purpose 'of this act of 1857
was to ratify and confirm-the various steps taken by the
Secretary of the Interior in the selection of swamp and overflowed lands. It was general in its terms, reaching to all the
States, and the different modes by which identification of the
swamp and overflowed lands had been attempted to be accomplished. It cannot fairly be construed as intending to put an
end to all further inquiry in the land department, nor to oust
that department of jurisdiction to inquire into and correct any
frauds or mistakes, but was -a general ratification and confirmation of the methods pursued. It cannot be supposed
that Congress intended by this act to condone all frauds, to
prevent the correction of errors or mistakes, to take every-

Opinion of the Court.

thing as it then appeared on the records of the land department, and, forbidding any further inquiry, declare that lands
which by such records, through error or fraud, appeared to be
swamp and overflowed, should be granted to the State. It
vas not an act to enlarge the grant of 1850. It was not an act
to oust the land department of its ordinary jurisdiction to inquire into and ascertain what were swamp and overflowed
lands, but was an act confirming and ratifying the methods
thus far pursued. Congress must have been aware of the fact
that there were charges of fraud or mistake'in reference to the
surveys in the State of Michigan. It had appropriated large
sums for resurveys. They had partially been made, and mistakes, if not frauds, had been found. It does not appear that
such charges existed in reference to the surveys in other States;
at any rate, it is not to be presumed that all surveys in all the
States were fraudulent or erroneous, and it would require very
clear and direct language before'the intent could be imputed
to Congress to ignore the existence of alleged frauds and errors
in the one State and to confirm titles to lands in that State
based upon such fraudulent or erroneous surveys, and thereby
enlarge, perhaps very materially, the amount .of the grant to
such State. The language of the act does not compel any such
conclusion as to the intent of Congress.
The decision in Xlartin v. ilarks,97 U. S. 315, does not conflict with this construction of the act of 1857. It is true this
language is found in the opinion: "After the passage of that
act the land department had no right to set aside the selections." But in that case there was no, question of the power
of the land department to correct errors or mistakes. The
plaintiff relied on a list made by the surveyor general of Louisiana of swamp and overflowed lands, which list, containing
the land in dispute, had been forwarded to -the general land
office, and there filed. It did not appear that this list had
been formally approved by the Secretary of the Interior, as
contemplated by the act of 1850. The defendant relied on a
patent from the United States, issued long thereafter. It was
held that the act of 1857 dispensed with the formal approval
by the Secretary of the Interior, and confirmed the lists made

and filed with the commissioner of the general land office.
And in view of that fact, and as no question had been made
in the land department of the correctness of the survey, it was
adjudged that the equitable title of the State to the land was
perfect. Sol in this case, if there had been no challenge of
the original surveys, no attempt at a resurvey or to correct
errors or mistakes, and there had been simply a lack of the
formal approval of the list by the Secretary of the Interior,
that case would have compelled an adjudication that the full
equitable title -had passed to the State of Michigan, and would
have invalidated the patent subsequently issued by the United
States directly to the parties under whom the defendants
claim. But that is far from deciding that all power in the
land department to inquire into frauds or errors in the surveys
was taken away and all -frauds upon the Government in such
surveys condoned. It was merely a decision that as the identification by the surveyor general of the land as swamp land
had not been challenged for fraud or mistake, it was binding
on the question of title, and the approval by the Secretary of
the Interior and the issue of the patent were simply ministerial
acts. See also Blanc v. -Lafayette, 11 How. 104.
