ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR THE

DISTRICT OF M[ASSACHUSETTS.
No. 340. Argued October 18, 19, 1M97.
-Decided December 18, 189T.
This was an indictment for murder alleged to have been committed on an
American vessel on the high seas. After the crime was discovered,
Brown, a sailor, was put in irons and the vessel was headed for Halifax. Before it reached there Brown charged Brain with the commission of the crime, saying that he had seen him do it. Brain was then
also put in irons. On the arrival at Halifax, Power, a policeman and
detective in the government service at that place, had a conversation
with Brain. Brain was indicted at Boston for the commission of the
crime, and on his -trial Power was offered as a witness for the Government. He testified that he made an examination of Brain, in his own
office, in the city hall at Halifax, when no one was present besides Brain
and himself; and that no threats were made in any way to Brain, nor
any inducements held out to him. The witness was then asked: "What
did you say to him and he to you?" To this defendant's counselobjected. The defendant's counsel was permitted to cross-examine the
witness before the court ruled upon the objection, and the witness stated'
that the conversation took place in his office, where he had caused the
defendant Brain to be brought by a police officer; that up to that time
the defendant had been in the custody of the police authorities of Halifax;
that the witness asked that the defendant should be brought to his office
for the purpose of interviewing him; that at his office he stripped the
defendant and examined his clothing, but not his pockets;. that he told
the defendant to submit to an examination, and that he searched him;
that the defendant was then in custody and did everything the witness
directed him to do; that all this took place before the defendant had
been examined before the United States consul, and that the witness did
net know that the local authorities had at that time taken any action, or
that the defendant was held for the United States -for the consul general of the United States. The witness ansvered questions-by the court
as follows: "You say there was no inducement to him in the way of

promise or expectation of advantage?"
"A. Not any, your hoilor."
" Q. Held out ?" "A. Not any, your honor." "Q. Nor anything said,
in the way of suggestion to him that he might suffer if he did not - that
it might be worse for him ?" " A. No, sir ; not any." " Q. So far as
you were concerned, it was entirely voluntary ?." "A. Voluntary, indeed."
" Q. No influence on your part exerted to persuade him one way or the
other?" "A. None whatever, sir; none whatever." The defendant then
renewed his objection to the question, what conversation had taken place
between Brain and the witness, for the following reasons : That at the
time the defendant was in the custody of the chief of police at Halifax;
that the witness in an official capacity directed the police authorities to
bring defendant as a prisoner to his office and there stripped him; that
defendant understood that he was a prisoner, and obeyed every order
and direction that the witness gave. Under th~se circumstances the
counsel submitted that no statement made by the defendant while so
held in custody and his rights interfered with to the extent described
was a free and voluntary statement, and no statement as made by him
bearing upon this issue was competent. The objection was overruled,
and the defendant excepted on all the grounds above stated, and the
exceptions were allowed. The witness answered as follows: "When
Mr. Bram came into my office, I said to him: 'Brain, we are trying to
unravel this horrible mystery.' I said: ' Your position is rather an awkward one. I have had Brown in this office and he made a statement that
he saw you do the murder.' He said: 'He could not have seen me;
where was he?' I said: 'He states he was at the wheel.' 'Wellhe said;
'he could not see me from there.' I said: 'Now, look here, Brain, I
am satisfied that you killed the captain from all I have heard from Mr.
Brown. But,' I said, ' some of us here think you could not have done
all that crime alone. If you had an accomplice, you should say so, and
not have the blame of this horrible crime on your own shoulders.' He said:
' Well, I think, and many others on board the ship think, that Brown is
the murderer; but I don't know anything about it.' He was rather short
in his replies." " Q. Anything further said by either of you ?" "A. No;
there was nothing further said on that occasion." The direct examination of this witness was limited to the interview between the witness
and the.defendant Brain. Held,
(1) That this statement made by the accused to a police officer, was
evidently not a voluntary confession and was not admissible in
evidence agaiust him;
(2) That the objection to its admission, liaving been twice presented
and regularly allowed, it was not necessary that it should be renewed at the termination of the testimony of the witness.
The objection that the indictment recited that it was presented upon the
oath of the jurors when the fact was that it was presented upon the oath
and affirmation of the jurors is without merit.
The objection that neither in the indictment, nor in the proof at the hearing
of the pleas in abatement was it affirmatively stated or
shown that grand

juror Merrill, before being permitted to affirm, was shown to have possessed conscientious scruples against taking an oath is also without merit.
As the evidence against Brain was purely circumstantial, it was clearly
proper for the Government to endeavor to establish, as a circumstance
in the case, the fact that another person who was present in the vicinity
at the time of the killing, could not have committed the crime.
The objection to a question asked of a medical witness, whether, in his
opinion, a man standing at the hip of a recumbent person snd striking
blows on that person's head and forehead with an axe would necessarily
be spattered with, or covered with, some of the blood, was also properly

delivered the opinion of the court.

This writ of error is prosecuted to -a verdict and.- sentence
thereon, by wlich the plaintiff was found guilty of murder,
and condemned to suffer death. The homicide was committed
on board the American ship Herbert Fuller while on the high
seas bound from Boston to a port in South America. The
accused was the first officer of the ship, and the deceased, of
whose murder he was convicted, was the master of the vessel.
The bill of exc.eptions, after stating the sailing of the vessel
from Boston on the 2d of July, 1896, with a cargo of lumber,
gives a general summary of the facts leading up to and surrounding the homicide as follows:
"She had on board a captain, Charles I. Nash; Brain, the
defendant; a second mate, August W. Blomberg; a steward,
and six seamen; also the captain's wife, Laura A. Nash, and
one passenger, Lester H. Monks.
"The vessel proceeded on her course toward her port of
destination until the night between July 13 and July 14. On
that night at 12 o'clock the second mate's watch was relieved
'by the mate's watch, of which Brain, thd defendant, was

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the officer in charge. The captain, his wife, the passenger
Monks and the first mate and the second mate, all lived in
the aftercabin, occupying separate rooms.

.

.

The crew

and the steward slept forward in the forward house.
"When the watch was. changed at midnight, Brain, the
defendant, took the deck, the seamen Loheac and Perdok
went forward on the lookout, and Charles Brown, otherwise
called Justus Leopold Westerberg, his true name, took the
wheel, where it was his duty to remain till two o'clock, at
about which time he was relieved by Loheac. The second
mate went to his room and the seamen of his watch to their
quarters at twelve midnight, and there was no evidence that
any of them or the steward appeared again till daylight.
"The passenger Monks, who occupied a room on the starboard side of the cabin, between the chart room where the
captain slept and the room on the -forward starboard side
where Mrs. Nash slept, with doors opening from the passenger's room into both the chart room used by the captain
as his room and that of Mrs. Nash, was aroused not far from
two o'clock- the exact time is not known, as he says - by a
scream, and by another sound characterized by him as a gurgling sound. He arose, went to the captain's ro6m, and found
the captain's cot overturned and the captain lying on the floor
by it. He spoke, but got n6 answer; put his hand on the
captain's body and found it damp or wet. He then went to
Mrs. Nash's room, did not see her, but saw dark spots on her
bedding, and suspected something wrong. He went on deck
and called the mate, the defendant, telling him the captain
was killed. Both went below, took down the lantern hanging
in the main cabin, burning dimly, turned it up and went
throbgh the captain's room to the passenger's room, and the
passenger there put on a shirt and pantaloons. They then
both returned to the deck, the mate on the way stopping a
brief time in his own room. Brain and Monks remained
talking on deck till about daybreak, when the steward was
called and told what had happened. Up to this time no call
had been made for the second mate, nor had any one visited
his room. Later it was found that Captain Nash, his wife and

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion'of the Court.

Blomberg, the second mate, were all dead, each with several
wounds upon the head, apparently given with a sharp instrument like an axe, penetrating the skull and into the substance
of the brain, and the second mate lying on his back with his
feet crossed, in his berth; Mrs. Nash in her bed, in her room,
and at the back side of the bed, and Captain Nash in his
room, as already stated.
"The whole crew was called at or about daylight and were
informed of the deaths.
"The bodies were removed from the cabin and placed in
the jolly- boat, and the boat was towed astern to Halifax.
The cabin was then locked, Bram taking the keys, and it
remained locked till the vessel rceached Halifax.
"At first, after the discovery: of the murders, there was
some hesitancy as to where the vessel should go. At the
defendant's suggestion she was headed to go to Cayenne in
French Guiana, but the plan was changed and she steered for
Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she arrived July 21, and was
taken possession of by the local authorities at the instance of
the consul general of the United States.
".At first, after the discovery of the murders, Brain, on
whom had devolved the command of the ship, made Brown
chief mate and Loheac second mate.
"No blood or spots of blood were ever discovered on the
person or the clothing of any person on board, nor did anything direct suspicion to any one.
"In a dayor two, suspicion having been excited in respect
to the seaman. Brown, the crew, under the supervision of
Brain, seized him, he not resisting, and put him in irons. All
the while the officers and seamen remained on deck. Brain
navigated the ship until Sunday before they reached Halifax
on Tuesday, and after the land of Nova Scotia was in sight,
when, Brown having stated to his shipmates, or some of them,
that he saw into the cabin through a window in the afterpart
and on the starboard side of the house, and saw Bram, the
mate, kill ihe captain. In consequence of this statement of
Brown, the crew, led by the steward, suddenly overpowered
the mate and put him in irons, he making no resistance, but

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

declaring his innocence. Brai and Brown were both carried
into Halifax in irons."
The bill of exceptions further states that when the ship
arrived at Halifax the accused and Brown were held in custody by the chief of police at that place, and that whilst in
such custody the accused was taken from prison to the office of a detective and there questioned under circumstances
to be hereafter stated. Subsequently to this occurrence at
Halifax, all the officers, the crew and the passenger were
examined before the American consul and gave their statements, which were reduced to writing and sworn to. They
were thereafter, at the request of the American consul, sent
to Boston, where the accused was indicted for the murder of
Nash, the captain, of Mrs. Nash, and the second mate Blomberg. The trial and the conviction, now under review, related
to the first of these charges. The errors which are here assigned as grounds for reversal, aie more than sixty in number,.
and are classified by the counsel for the accused as follows:
(a) Questions raised preliminary to the trial. (b) Questions
raised during the trial. (c) Questions raised in connection
with two motions for a new trial.
We first examine the error relied on which seems to us
deserving of the most serious consideration. During the trial,
a detective by whom the ac~used was questioned whilst at
Halifax was placed upon the stand as a witness for the prosecution for the purpose of testifying to the conversation had
between himself and the accused at Halifax, at the time and
place already stated. What took place between the accused
and the detective at the time of the conversation, and what
occurred when the witness was tendered in order to prove the
confession, is thus stated in the bill of. exceptions:
"Nicholas Power, of Halifax, called by the Government,
testified that he was connected with the police department of
Halifax, and had been for thirty-two years, and for the last
fifteen years of that time as a detective officer; that after the
arrival of the Herbert Fuller at Halifax, in consequence of a
conversation with Charles Brown, he made an examination of
Brain, the defendant, in the witness's office, in the city hall

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

at Halifax, when no one was present besides Brain and the
witness. The witness testified that no threats were made in
any way to-Brain, nor any inducements held out to him.
"The witness was then asked: ' What did you say to him
and he to you?'
"To this the defendant's counsel objected. The defendant's
counsel was permitted to cross-examine the witness before the
court ruled upon the objection, and the witness stated that the
conversation took place in his office, where he had caused
the defendant Brain to be brought by a police officer; that
up to that time the defendant had been in the custody of the
police authorities, of Halifax, in the custody of the superintendent of police, John O'Sullivan; that the witness asked
that the defendant should be brdught to his office for the purpose of interviewing him; that ht his office he stripped the defendant and examined his clothing, but not his pockets; that
he told the defendant to submit to an examination, and that he
searched him; that the defendant was then in custody and
did everything the witness directed him to do; that the witness was then a police officer acting in his official capacity;
that all this took place before the defendant had been examined before the United States consul, and that the witness
did not know that the local authorities had at that time taken
any action, but that the defendant was held for the United
States -- for the consul general of the United States.
"The witness answered questions by the court as follows:
"You say there was no inducement to him in the way of
promise or expectation of advantage?
"A. Not any, your honor.
"Q. Held out?,
"A. Not any, your honor.
"Q. Nor anything said, in the way of suggestion to him
that he might suffer if he did not -that it might be worse
for him?
"A. No, sir; not any.
"Q. So far as you were concerned, it was entirely voluna
tary ?
"A. Voluntary, indeed.

BRAM 'v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

"Q. No influence on your part exerted to persuade him one
way or the other?
"A. None whatever, sir; none whatever.
"The defendant then renewed his objection to the question,
what conversation had taken place between Bram and the
witness, for the following reasons: That at the time the defendant was in the custody of the chief of police at Halifax;
that the witness in an official capacity directed the police
authorities to bring the defendant as a,prisoner to his private
office and there proceeded to take extraordinary liberties with
him; he stripped him; the defendant understood that he was
a prisoner, and he obeyed every order and direction that the
witness gave. Under these circumstances the counsel submitted that no statement made by the defendant while so
held in custody and his rights interfered with to the extent
described was a free and voluntary statement, and no statement as made by him bearing upon this issue was competent.
"The objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted
on all the grounds above stated, and the exceptions were
allowed.
"The witness answered as follows:
"When Mr. Brain came into my office, I said to him:
'Bram, we are trying to unravel this horrible mystery.' I
said: 'Your position is rathei an awkward one. I have had
Brown in this office and he made a statement that he saw you
do the murder.' He said: I He could not have seen me ;
where was he?' I said: ' He states he was at the wheel.'
'Well,' he said, 'he could not see me from there.' I said:
'Now, look here, Bram, I am satisfied that you killed the
captain from all I have heard from Mr. Brown. But,' I said,
'some of us here think you could not have done all that crime
alone. If you had an accomplice, you should say so, and not
have the blame of this horrible crime on your own shoulders.'
He said: 'Well, I think, and many others on board the ship
think, that Brown is the murderer; but I don't know anything about it.' He was rather short in his replies.
"Q. Anything further said by either of you ?
"A. No; there was nothing further said on that occasion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

"The direct examination of this witness was limited to the
interview between the witness and the defendant Brain.
"On cross-examination of the witness Power, he testified
that at the time of the above-stated examination he took possession of a pair of suspenders belonging to the defendant,
and kept the same in his office until the prisoners were coring to Boston -the whole crew and the passenger were imprisoned at Halifax, and sent as prisoners to Boston - when
he handed them over to the Halifax superintendent of police,
and they were sent to Boston, with other property, of the
defendant.
"Defendant's counsel, upon the ground of showing interest
on the part of the witness, then asked: ' What other articles
belonging to the defendant did you take possession of at that
time?' "This line of inquiry was objected to by the District Attorney on the ground that the matter was not opened on the
direct examination, and the defendant could call the witness
as part of his case if he saw fit. The court excluded the
inquiry, ruling that it was not proper cross-examination and
did not tend to show interest, and the defendant duly excepted,
and the exception was allowed."
The contention is that the foregoing conversation, between
the detective and the accused, was competent only as a confession by him made; that it was offered as such, and that it
was erroneously admitted, as it was not shown to have been
voluntary. The question thus presented was manifestly covered by the exception which was taken at the trial. When it
was proposed to examine the detective officer as to the conversation had by him with the accused, objection was duly
made. The court thereupon allowed the officer to be examined and cross-examined as to the circumstances attending
the conversation which it was proposed to offer as a confession.
When this examination was concluded the accused renewed
his objection, and his exception to the admissibility of the
conversation was allowed and regularly noted. The witness
then proceeded to give the conversation. To say that under
these circumstances the objection which was twice presented

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion oi the Court.

and regularly allowed should have been renewed at the termination of the testimony of the witness,. would be pushing to
an unreasonable length the salutary rule which requires that
exceptions be taken at the trial to rulings which are considered
erroneous, and the legality of which are thereafter to be questioned on error. There dan be no doubt that the manner in
which the exception was allowed and noted fully called attention to the fact that the admission of the conversation was
objected to because it was not voluntary, and the overruling
of this objection is the matter now assigned as error here.
Indeed, in the argument at bar no contention was made as to
the sufficiency and regularity of the exception. It is manifest
that the sole ground upon which the proof of the conversation
was tendered was that it was a confession, as this.was the
only conceivable hypothesis upon which it could have been
legally admitted to the jury. It is also clear that in determining whether the proper foundation was laid for its admission, we are not concerned with how far the confession tended
to prove guilt. Having been offered as a confession and being
admissible only because of that fact, a consideration of the
measure of proof which resulted from it does not arise in determining its admissibility. If found to have been illegally
admitted, reversible error will result, since the prosecution
cannot on the one hand offer evidence to prove guilt, and
which by the very offer is vouched for as tending to that end,
and on the other hand for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of the error, caused by its wrongful admission, be
heard to assert that the matter offered as a confession was not
prejudicial because it did not tend to prove guilt. The principle on the subject is thus stated in a note to section 219 of
Greenleaf on Evidence: "The rule excludes not only direct
confessions, but any other declaration tending to- implicate
the prisoner in the crime charged, even thougb, in terms, it
is an accusation of another, or a refusal to confess. Rem v.
Tyler, 1 0. & 1. 129; Rex v. Enoch, 5 0. & P. 539. See
further, as to the object of the rule, Rex v. Court, 7 0. & P.
486, per Littledale, J.; People v. Ward, 15 Wend. 231." Nor
from the fact that in Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

mention was made of the circumstance that the statement of
the accused was a mere denial of guilt accompanied with exculpatory explanations, does the decision in that case conflict
with the principle we have just stated. The ruling there
'made that error to the prejudice of the accused did not arise
from the admission of the statement there considered, was
based not alone upon the nature of the statement but upon
"the evidence of its voluntary character; the absence of any
threat, compulsion or inducement; or assertion or indication
of fear; or even of such influence as the administration of
an oath has been supposed to exert." (p. 624.)
The contradiction involved in the assertion that the statement of an accused tended to prove guilt, and therefore was
admissible, and. then after produring its admission claiming
that it did not tend to prove guilt, and could not, therefore,
have been prejudicial, has been well stated by the Supreme.
Court of North Carolina, State v. Rorie, (1876) 7T4 N. C. 148:
"But the State says this was a denial of guilt and not a
confession. It was a declaration which the State used to procure a conviction; and it is not for the.State to say the declaration did not prejudice the prisoner's case. Why introduce
it at all unless it was to lay a foundation for the prosecution?
The use which was made of the prisoifer's statement precluded
the State from saying that it was not used to his prejudice."
(p. 150.).
In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, whereever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent
because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the.Constitution -ofthe United
States, commanding that no person "shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself." The legal
principle by which the admissibility of the confession of an
accused person is to be determined is expressed in the text-books.
In 3 Russell on Crimes, (6th ed.) 478, if is stated as follows:
"But a confession, in order to be admissible, must be free
and voluntary: that is, must not be extracted by any-sort of
threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied

BRAN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence.

.

.

.

A confession can never be re-

ceived in evidence where the prisoner has been influenced
by any threat or promise; for the law cannot measure the
force of the influence used, or decide upon its effect upon the
mind of the prisoner, and therefore excludes the declaration
if any degree of influence has been exerted."
And this summary of the law is in harmony with the doctrine as expressed by other writers, although the form in
which they couch its statement may be different. 1 Green.
Ev. (15th ed.) § 219; Wharton Crim. Ev. (9th ed.) § 631;
2 Taylor Ev. (9th ed.) § 8722; 1 Bishop's New Crim. Proc.
§ 1217, par. 4.
These writers but express the result of a multitude of
American and English cases, which will be found collected
by the authors and editors either in the text or in notes, especially in the ninth edition of Taylor, second volume, tenth
chapter, and the American notes, following page 588, where
a very full reference is made to decided cases. The statement of the rule is also in entire accord with the decisions
of this court on the subject. ifopt v. Utah, (1883)- 110 U. S.
574; Spar]' v. United States, (1895) 156 U. S. 51, 55; Pierce
v. United States, (1896) 160 U. S. 355, and Wilsm v. United
States, (1896) 162 U. S. 613.
A brief consideration of the reasons which gave rise to the
adoption of the Fifth Amendment, of the wrongs which it
was intended to prevent and of the safeguards which it was its
purpose unalterably to secure, will make it clear that the generic language of the Amendment was but a crystallization of
the doctrine as to confessions, well settled when the Amendment was adopted, and since expressed in the text writers
and expounded by the adjudications, and hence that the statementson the subject by the text writers and adjudications
but formulate the conceptions and commands of the Amendment itself. In Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, attention
was called to the intimate relation existing between the provision of the Fifth Amendment securing one accused against
being compelled to testify against himself, and those of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

Fourth Amendment protecting against unreasonable searches
and seizures; and it was in that case demonstrated that both
of these Amendments contemplated perpetuating, in their full
efficacy, by means of a constitutional provision, principles of
humanity and civil libertr, which had been secured in the
mother country only after years of struggle, so as to implant
them in our institutions in the fullness of their integrity, free
from tie possibilities of future legislative change. In commenting on the same subject, in Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S.

591, 596, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, said :
"The maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare had its origin
in a protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust
methods of interrogating accused persons, which has long
obtained in the continental system, and, until the expulsion of
the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688, and the erectior
of additional barriers for the protection of the people against
the exercise of arbitrary power, was not uncommon even in
England. While the admissions or confessions of the prisoner,
when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high
in the scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person be
asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime under
investigation, the ease with which the questions put to him
may assume an inquisitorial character, .the temptation to press
the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and to entrap him into fatal
contradictions, which is so painfully evident in many of the
earlier state trials, notably in those of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and Udal, the Puritan minister, made the system so
odious as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition. The
change in the English criminal procedure in that particular
seems to be founded upon no statute and no judicial opinion,
but upon a general and silent acquiescence of the courts in a
popular demand. But, -however adopted, it has become firmly
embedded in English, as well as in American jurisprtidence.
So deeply did the iniquities of the ancient system impress
themselves upon the minds of the American colonists that the
States, with one accord, made a denial of the right to question an accused person a part of their fundamental law, so that

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

a maxim, which in England was a mere rule of evidence, became clothed in this country with the impregnability of a
constitutional enactment."
There can be no doubt that long prior to our independence
the doctrine that one accused of crime could not be compelled
to testify against himself had reached its full development in
the common law, was there considered as resting on the law
of nature, and was embedded in that system as one of its great
and distinguishing attributes.
In Burrowes v. High, commission Court, (1616) Bulstr. pt.
3, page 48, Lord Coke makes reference to two decisions of the
courts of common law as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
wherein it was decided that the right of a party not to be
compelled to accuse himself could not be violated by the
ecclesiastical courts. Whatever, after that date, may have
been the departure in practice from this principle of the common law, (Taylor on Evidence, § 886 2,) certain it is that, without a statute so commanding, in Felton's case, (1628) 3 How.
St. Tr. 371, the judges unanimously resolved, on the question
being submitted to them by the King, that "no such punishment as torture by the rack was known or allowed by our
law."
Lord Hale died December 25, 1676. In the first volume of
his Pleas of the Crown, 1st ed. 1736, treating of the subject
of confessions in cases of treason, it is said at p. 304:
"That the confession before one of the Privy Council or a
justice of the peace being voluntarily made without torture is
sufficient as to the indictment on trial to satisfy the statute,
and it is not necessary that it be a confession in court; but
the confession is sufficient if made before him that hath power
to take an.examination."
In the second volume, at p. 225, it is said:
"When the prisoner is arraigned, and demanded what he
saith to the indictment, either he confesseth the indictment,
or pleads to it, or stands mute, and will not answer.
"The confession is either simple, or relative in order to the
attainment of some other advantage.

"If it be hut an extra judicial confession, tho it be in court,
as where the prisoner freely tells the fact, and demands the
opinion of the court whether it be felony, tho upon the fact
thus shown it appear to be felony, the court will not record
his confession, but admit him to plead to the felony not gutilty.
22 Assiz. 71, and Staref. P. 0. Lib. II, cap. 51, fol. 142 b."
In chapter 38 of vol. 2, at p. 284, after referring to the
power of justices of the peace and coroners, under the statutes
of Philip and Mary, to take examinations of accused persons,
but not upon oath, and that the same might be read in evidence on the trial of the prisoner, it is said:
" But then, 1. Oath must be made either by the justice or
coroner, that took them, or the clerk that wrote them, that'
they are the true substance of what the informer gave in upon
oath, and what the prisoner confessed upon his examination.
"2. As to the examination of the prisoner, it must be testified, that he did it freely without any menace, or undue terror
imposed upon him; for I have known the prisoner disown his
confession upon his examination, and hath sometimes been
acquitted against such his confession;

Gilbert, in his treatise on Evidence, (2d ed. - published in
1760,) says, at p.. 140:
S..But then this confession must be voluntary and
without compulsion; for our law in this differs from the civil
law, that it will not force any man to accuse himself; and in
this we do certainly follow the law of nature, which commands every man to endeavor his own preservation; and
therefore pain and force may compel men to confess what is
not the truth of facts, and consequently such extorted confessions are not to be depended on."
In Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, (6th ed., by Leach - published in 1787,) book 2, chapter 31, it is said:
"SEc. 2.....
.. And where a person upon his arraign-

ment actually confesses himself guilty, or unadvisedly discloses the special manner of the fact, supposing that it doth
not amount to felony 'where it doth, yet the judges, -upon
probable circumstances, that such confession may proceed
from fear, menace or duress, or from weakness, or ignor nce,
may refuse to record such confession, and suffer the party to
plead not guilty."
In section 3, chap. 46, it is stated that examinations by the
common law before a Secretary of State or other magistrate
for treason or other crimes not within the statutes of Philip
and Mary, and also the confession of the defendant himself in
discourse with private persons, iight be given in evidence
against the party confessing. A note (2) to this section,
presumably inserted by the editor, (see note to Gilliam's case,
9, Moody, pp. 19€--5,) reads as follows:
"The human mind under the pressure of calamity, is easily
seduced; and is liable, in the alarm of danger, to acknowledge indiscriminately a falsehood or a truth, as different agitations may prevail. A confession, therefore, whether made
upon an official examination or in discourse with private persons, which is obtained from a defendant, either by the flattery of hope, or by the impressions of fear, however slightly
the emotions may be implanted, (vide 0. B. 1786, page 387,)
is not admissible evidence; for the law will not suffer a
prisoner to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction."
Although the English reports, prior to the separation, are
almost devoid of decisions applying the principles stated by
Lord Hale, Hawkins and Gilbert, both the opinion of Lord
Mansfield in Rex v. Rudd, (1775) Oowp. 331, and that of Mr.
Justice Wilson, some years after the separation, in Zambe's
case, (1791) 2 Leach, (4th ed.) 552, make it certain that the
rule as stated by Hawkins, Gilbert and Hale was considered
in the English courts as no longer open to quesSon and as
one of the fundamental principles of the common law. Looking at the doctrine as thus established, it would seem plainly
to be deducible that as the principle from which, under the
law of nature, it was held that one accused could not be com-

Opinion of the Court.

pelled to testify against himself, was in its essence comprehensive enough to exclude all manifestations of c6mpulsion,
whether arising. from torture or from moral causes, the rule
formulating the principle with logical accuracy, came to be
so stated as to embrace all cases of compulsion which were
covered by the doctrine. As the facts by which compulsion
might manifest itself, whether physical or moral, would be
necessarily ever different, the measure by which the involuntary nature of the confession was to be ascertained was stated
in the rule, not by the changing causes, but by their resultant
effect upon the mind, that is, hope or fear, so that, however
diverse might be the facts, the test of whether the confession
was voluntary would be uniform, that is, would be ascertained
by the condition of mind which the causes ordinarily operated
to create. The well settled nature of the rule in England at
the time of the adoption of the Constitution and of the Fifth
Amendment, and the intimate knowledge had by the framers
of the principles of civil liberty which had become a part of
the common law, aptly explain the conciseness of the language of that Amendment. And the accuracy with which
the doctrine as to confessions as now formulated embodies
the rule existing at common law and embedded in the Fifth
Amendment was noticed by this court in Wilson v. United
States, supra, where, after referring to -the criteria of hope
and fear, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, it was
said: "In short, the true test of admissibility is"
that the confession is made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or
inducement of any sort." 162 U. S. 613, 623.
In approaching the adjudicated cases for the purpose of endeavoring to deduce from them what quantum of proof, in a
case presented, is adequate to create, by the operation of hope
or fear, an involuntary condition of the mind, the difficulty
encountered is, that all the decided cases necessarily rest upon
the state of facts which existed in the particular case, and,
therefore, furnish no certain criterion, since the con6lusion
that a given state of fact was adequate to have produced an
involuntary confession does not establish that the same result
has been created.by a different although somewhat similar con-

BRAE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Conrt.

dition of fact. Indeed, the embarrassment which comes from
the varying state of fact, considered in the decided cases, has
given rise to the statement that there was no general rule of
law by which the admissibility of a confession could be determined, but that the courts had left the rule to be evolved from
th'e facts of each particular case. 2 Taylor Ev. § 8722. And,
again, it has been said that so great was the perplexity resulting from an attempt to reconcile the authorities that it was
manifest that not only must each case solely depend upon its
own facts, but that even the legal rule to be applied was in.
volved in obscurity and confusion. Green v. State, 88 Georgia,
516; State v. Patterson,73 Miss6uri, 695, 705; State v. Hattlhews, 66 N. 0. 106, 109.
The first of these statements but expresses the thought that
whether a confession was voluntary was primarily one of fact,
and therefore every case must depend upon its own proof.
The second is obviously a misconception, for, however great
may be the divergence between the facts decided in previous
cases and those presented in any given case, no doubt or obscurity can arise as to the rule itself, since it is found in the
text of the Constitution. Much of the confusion which has
resulted from the effort to deduce from the adjudged cases
what would be a sufficient quantum of proof to show that a
confession was or was not voluntary, has arisen from a misconception of the subject to which the proof must address
itself. The rule is not that in order to render a statement
admissible the proof must be adequate to establish that the
particular communications contained in a statement were voluntarily made, but it must be sufficient to establish that the
making of the statement was voluntary; that is to say, that
from the causes, which the law treats as legally sufficient to
engender in the mind of the accused hope or fear in respect
to the crime charged, the accused was not involuntarily
impelled to make a statement, when but for the improper influences he would have remained silent. With his understanding of the rule we come to a consideration of the authorities.
By statutes enacted early in the second half of the sixteenth
century, 1 & 2 Ph. & M. c. 13 and 2 & 3 Ph. & MN.c. 10,

.550

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

justices of the peace were directed on accusations of felony to
"take the examination of the said prisoner and information of
them that bring him." In 1655, the judges directed that the
examination of prisoners should be without oath, J. Kel. 2,
and the reason of this rule, Starkie on Evidence, (2d ed. p. 29)
says, was that an examination under oath "would be a species
of duress and a violation of the maxim that no one is bound
to criminate himself." The ruling of the judges in this regard
was recognized in the statute of 7 George IV, chap. 64, which,
although requiring " information of witnesses"- to be "upon
oath," simply directed an." examination" of the accused.
But, even where the examination was held withofit oath,
it came, to be settled by judicial decisions in England that
before such an examination could be received in evidence it
must appear that the accused was made to understand that it
was optional with him to make a statement. Rex v. Green,
(1832) 5 Car. & P. 312 ; Beg. v. Arnold, (1838) 8 Car. &P. 621.
The reason upon which this rule rested undoubtedly was, that
the mere fact of th6'magistrate's taking the statement, even
though unaccompanied with an' oath, might, unless he was
cautioned, operate upon the mind of the prisoner to impel him
involuntarily to speak. The judicial rule as to caution was
finally embodied into positive law by the statute of 11 & 12
Vict. c. 42, where, by section 18, the magistrate was directed,
after. having read or caused to be read to the accused the
depositions against him, to ask the accused: "Having heard
the evidence, do you wish to say anything in answer to the
charge? You are not obliged to say anything unless you
desire to do so, but whatever you say will be -taken down in
writing, and may be given in evidence against you upon your
trial."
The English courts were frequently called upon to determine whether language~used by a magistrate when about to
take the examination of one accused, tended to induce in the
mind of the latter such hope oi fear as to lead to involuntary
mental action. In Peg. v. Drew, (1837) 8 Car. & P. 140, and
Reg. v. iarris,(184-) 1 Cox 0. 0. 106, though the accused
had been cautioned not to say anything to prejudice 'himself,

-BRAM v. UNITED STATES.'
Opinion of tbe Court.

the further statement, in substance, by the magistrate or his
clerk, that what the prisoner said would be taken down, and
"would" be used for or against him at his trial, was held by
Coleridge, X., to be equivalent to saying that what the prisoner chose to say might be used in his favor at the trial, and
was a direct inducemnent to make a, confession, rendering the
statement incompetent as evidence. Like rulings were also
made in cases where similar assurance that the statement of
the prisoner would be, used were made to him by a police
officer. Beg. v. Xorton, (1843) 2 Moo. & Rob. 514, and Beg.
v. Furey,(1844) 1 Cox 0. C. 76.
In cases where statements of.one accused had been made to
others than the magistrate 'upon an examination, differences
of opinion arose among the English judges,.as to whether a
confession made to a person not in a position of authority over
the accused, was admissible in evidence after an inducement
has 'been held out.to the prisoner by such person. Rex v.
PSencer, (1837) 7 Car. & P. 776. It was finally settled, however, that the effect of inducements must be confined to those
made by persons in authority, Reg. v. Taylor, (1839) 8 Oar. &
P. 733 ; Peg. v. Moore, (1852) 2 Den. C. C. 5'2; although, in the
last cited case, while former precedents were followed, the
court expressed strong doubts as to the wisdom of the restriccion. (p. 527.) There can be no question, however, that a
police officer, actually or constructively in charge of one in
custody on. a suspicion of having committed crime,'is a person
in authority within the rule, and as this is so well established,
we- will not consider the adjudicated cases in order to. demonstrate it, but content ourselves with a reference to the state-.
ment on the subject made in Russell on Crimes, third volume,
at page 501.
Many other cases in the English reports illustrate the application of the rule excluding statements made ,under inducement 'improperly operating to influence the mind of an adcused
person.
In Rex v. Twmp8on, (1783) 1 Leach, (4th ed.) 291, a declaration to a suspected person that unless he.gave a more satisfactory account of his connection with a stolen bank note his

interrogator would take him before a magistrate, was held
equivalent to stating that it would be better to confess, and to
have operated to lead the prisoner to believe that he would
not be taken before a magistrate if he confessed. Baron
Hotham, after commenting upon the evidence, in substance,
said that.the prisoner was hardly a free agent at the time, as

though the language addressed to him scarcely amounted to a
threat, it was. certainly a strong invitation to the prisoner to
confess, the manhier in which it had been expressed rendering
itmore efficacious..
In Cass' case, (1784) 1 Leach, 293, a confession induced by
the statement -of the prosecutor to the accused, "I am in great
*distress about my irons; if you will tell me where they are, I
'Will be favorable to you," was-held inadmissible. 'Mr. Justice
Gould saidthat the slightest hopes of mercy held out to a
-prisoner to induce him to disclose the fact was pufficient to
.invalidate a confession.
In the cases follow ing,. statements made by a prisoner were
held inadmissible, because induced by the language set out in
each case: In Rex v. .riffln, (1809) Russ. & Ry. 151, telling
the prisoner that it would be better for him to confess; in
Rex v. Jdnes, (1809) Russ: &"Ry. 152, the prosecutor saying
to the accused that he only wanted his money, and if the
prisoner gave him that he might go to-the devil, if he pleased;
in Rex v. .Kingston, (1830) 4 Car. & P. 387, saying to the
accused, "you are under suspicion of this, and you had better
tell all you know;" in Re!x v. Enoch a
.iPlley, (1833) 5
Car. & P. 539, saying: "You had better tell the truth or it
will lie upon you, aid the man go free;" in Rex v. .Mill,
(1833) 6 Car. & P. 146, saying: "It is no use for you to deny
it, for there is the man and boy who vill swear they saw you
do it;" in Sherrington'scase, (1838) 2 Lewin 0. 0. 123, saying:
"-There is no doubt thou wilt be found guilty, it will be better
for you if you will confess;" in Rexv. Thomas, (1833) 6 Car.
& P. 353, saying: "You had better split, and not-suffer for
all of. them ;" in Rex v. SM son, (1834) 1 Moody, 410, and

relatives of the prosecutor, coupled with assurances to the

Opinion of the Court.

suspected person that it would be a good deal worse for her
if she did not, and that it would be better for her if she did
confess; in Rex v. Upchurch, (1836) 1 Moody, 465, saying:
"If you are guilty, do confess; it will perhaps save your
neck; you will have to go to prison; if William H. (another
person suspected, and whom the prisoner had charged) is
found clear, the guilt will fall on you. Pray, tell me if you
did it;" in Beg. v. Croydon, (1846) 2 Cox 0. C. 67, saying:
"I dare say you had a hand in it; you may as well tell me all
about it;" in Beg. v. Garner,(1848) 1 Den. C.C. 329, saying:
"It will be better for you to speak out."
In Reg. v. Fleming, (1842) Arm., M. & 0. 330, statements
of a police officer suspected of having committed a crime, in
answer to questions propounded by his superior in office, after
the latter had warned the accused to be cautious in his answers, were held inadmissible. The court said: "The prisoner and the witnesses being both in the police force, the
prisoner, as the witness admitted, might have conceived himself bound to tell the truth; and the caution was not of that
nature which should make the confession of the prisoner
admissible."
In the leading case of Beg. v. Baldry, (1852) 2 Den. C. 0.
430, after full consideration, it was held that the declaration
made to a prisoner, who had first been cautioned that what
be said" would" be used as evidence, merely imported that
such statement "might" be used, and could not have induced
in the mind of the prisoner a hope of benefit sufficient to lead
him to make a statement. The cases of Beg. v. Drew, Reg. v.
Harris,Beg. v. ]forton and Beg. v. Furey,heretofore referred
to, were held to have been erroneously decided.
In the course of the argument, counsel for the prisoner cited
and commented upon Case' case, Rex v. T/omas, Sherringion's case and Rex v. Enoch, also heretofore referred to, as
illustrating the doctrine that assuring the accused that it
would be better for him to speak or other intimation given of
possible benefit would invalidate a confession thus induced.
After counsel had concluded his reference to these cases, Pollock, 0. B., said (p. 432): "There is no doubt as to the appli-

OCTOBER TERMIf, 1897.
Opinion of the Court

cation of the rule in those cases, which are all familiar to the
judges and to the bar."
In the course of the opinion, subsequently delivered by him,
ChiefBaron Pollock said (p. 442):
A simple caution to the accused to tell the truth, if he
A"
says anything, has been decided not to be sufficient to prevent the statement made being given in evidence; and although it may be put that when a person is told to tell the
truth, he may Possibly understand that the only thing true
is that he is guilty, that is not what he ought to understand.
He is reminded that he need not say anything, but if he says
anything let it be true. It has'been decided that that would
not prevent the statement being received in evidence by
Littledale, J., in the case of Rex v. Court, 7 Car. & P. 486,
and by Rolfe, B., in a case at Gloucester, Beg. v. Hfolmes,
1 Car. & K. 248 ; but where the admonition to speak the truth
has been coupled with any expression importing that it would
be better for him to do so, it has been held that the confession was not receivable, - the objectionable words being
that it would be better to speak the truth, because they
import that it would be better for him to say something.
This was decided in the case of Beg. v. Garner, I Den. C. C.
329. , The true distinction between the present case and a
case of that kind is, that it is left. to the prisoner a matter
of perfect indifference whether he should open his mouth
or not."

In Beg. v. Moore, (1852) 2 Den. C. C. 522, also decided by
the Court. of Criminal Appeal, an admonition to a person
suspected of crime that she "had better speak the truth,"
was held not to vitiate a subsequent confession, because not
made by a person in authority. Parke, B., delivering the
opinion of the judges, said, in substance, (p. 526,) that one"
element in the consideration of the question whether a confession ought to be excluded was "whether the threat or
inducement was such as to be likely to influence the prisoner," and "that i] -the threat or inducement was held out,
actually or constiuctiveZy by a person in authority,it cannot
be received, however slight -the threat or induenent."

BRAM v. UNITED STATES..
Opinion of the Court.

In Beg. v. Cheverton, (1862) 2 F. & F. 833, a; statement
made by a policeman to a person in his'custody, that "you
had better tell all-about it, it will save you trouble," was held
to opeiate as a threat or inducement sufficient to render what
was said by the prisoner inadmissibl.
In Beg. v. FeneZl, (1881) 7 Q. B. D. 147, the Court for
Crown Cases Reserved referred approvingly to the statement"
of the rule contained in Russell on Crimes, and, "upon all the
decided cases," held inadmissible a statement made induced
by the prosecutor saying to the prisoner in the presence of
an inspector of police: "The inspector tells me you are makig housebreaking implements.; if this is so, you had better
tell the truth, it may be better for-you."
The latest decision in England on the subject of inducement, made by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved is Beg.
v. Thompson, (1893) 2 Q. B. 12. At the trial a confession
was offered in evidence, which had been made by the defendant before his arrest upon the charge of having embezzled
funds of a certain corporation. Objection was interposed
to its reception in evidence, on the ground that it had been
made under the operation of an inducement held out by the
chairman of the company in a statement to a relative of
the accused, intended to be and- actually communicated to
the latter, that "it will be the right thing for Marcellus (the
accused) to make a clean breast of it." Tie evidence 'having
been admitted and the prisoner convicted, the question was
submitted to the upper court whether the evidence of the
confession was properly admitted. The opinion of the appellate court was delivered by.Cave, J., and concurred in by
Lord Coleridge, C. J., Hawkins, Day and Wills, JJ. After
stating and adopting the ruling of Baron Parke in Beg. v.
Warringham,2 Den. C. C. 447,n, to the effect that it'was the
duty of the prosecutor to satisfy the trial judge that the
confession had not been obtained by improper means, and that
where it was impossible to collect from the proof whether
such was the case or not, th6 confession ought not to be received, the opinion referred approvingly to the declaration of
Pollock, C. B., in Beg. v. Baidry, that the true ground of the

•556

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

exclusion of statements not voluntary was that "it would not
be safe fo receive a statement made under any influence or
fear."* The court then quoted the rule laid down in Russell
on Crimes as being a statement of the principles which had
been restated and affirmed by the Lord Chief Justice in the
Fennell case, and added:
"If these principles and the reasons for them are, as it seems
impossible to doubt, well founded, they afford to magistrates
a simple test by -which the admissibility of a confession may
be decided. They have to ask - Is it proved affirmatively
that the confession was free and voluntary -that is, was it
preceded by any inducement, to make a statement held out by
a person in authority? If so, and the *inducement his not
'clearly been removed before the statement was made, evidence of the statement is inadmissible.'
After reviewing the evidence and holding that, under the
ruling of Pollock, C. B., in the Baidry case, it was immaterial
whethef the statements made by the chairman were calculated
to elicit the truth, and intimating that they tended to lead
the prisoner to believe that it would be better for him to say
something, the opinion concluded with deciding that "on the
broad, plain ground that it was not proved satisfactorily that
the confession, was free and voluntary," the confession ought
not to have been received.
Whilst, as we have said, there is no question that a police
officer having a prisoner in custody is a person in authority
within the rule in England, and therefore that any inducement by him offered, calculated to operate upon the mind of
the prisoner, would render a confession as a consequence
thereof inadmissible, there seems to be doubt in England
whether the doctrine does not extefid further, and hold that
the mere fact of the interrogation of a prisoner by a police
officer would per se render the confession inadmissible, because
of the .inducement resulting from -the very nature of the authority exercised by the police officer, assimilating him in this
regard to a committing or examining Magistrate. 3 Russell
-on Crimes, p. 510, note t. In .Beg. v. Johnston, 15 Ir. Com.
Law, 60 (1861), this subject was elaborately considered by the
-

BRAN

v. UNITED STATES.

557

Opinion of the Court.

Irish Court of Criminal Appeal, seven of the judges writing
opinions, and the majority concluding, on a full consideration
of the English and Irish auth6rities, that a policeman was not
such an official as would render per se any confession-elicited
by his questioning the prisoner iniadmissible, although the fact
of his questioning became an important elemdnt in determining whether inducement resulted from the language by him
used. The English authorities; however, referred to in the.
above note to IRussell on Crimes are later in date than -Beg.v.
Jdohn8ton, although they emanate from
pisi =rius
courts and
not from apellate tribunals. Whatever be the rule in this
regard in England, however, it is certain that where a confession is elicited by the questions of a policeman, the fact of
its having been so obtained, it is conceded, may be an important element in determining whether the answvers of the prisoner were voluntary. The attempt on the part of a police
officer to obtain a confession by interrogating has been often
reproved by the English courts as unfair to the prisoner and
as approaching dangerously near to a violation of the rule
protecting an accused'from being compelled to testify against
himself. Be2-riman's case, (1854) 6"Cox C. C. 388;, Cheverton8's case, (1862) 2 F. & F. 833; Mie'8 case, (1863) 3 F. & F.
822; 1egan.'8 case, (1867) 17 L. T. (N. S.) 325, and .?easo.'s
case, (1872) 12 Cox C. C. 228.
From this review it clearly appears that tbe rule as to confessions, by an accused, (leaving out of consideration the rule
now foll6wed in England restricting the effect of inducements, according as such inducements were or were not held
out by persons in authority,) is in England to-day what it ws
prior to and at the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, and
that whilst all the decided cases necessarily rest upon the
state of facts which the cases considered, neverthele'ss the
decisions as a whole afford a safe guide by which to ascertain whether in this case' the confession was voluntary, since
'the facts here presented are strikingly like those considered
in many of the English cases.
We come then to the American authorities. In this court the
general rule that the confession must be free and voluntary,

that is, not-produced by inducements engendering either hope
or fear, is settled by the authorities referred to at the outset.
The facts in the particular cases decided in this court, and
which have been referred to, manifested so clearly that the
confessions were voluntary, that no'useful purpose can be subserved by analyzing them. In this court also it has been
settled that the -mere fact that the confession is made to a
police officer, while the accused was under arrest in or out of
prison, or was diawn out by his questions, does not necessarily
render the confession involuntary, but, as one of the circumstances, such imprisonment or interrogation may be taken into
account in determining whether or not the statements of the
prisoner were voluntary. Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 171; .parf
v. 'UnitedStates, 156 U. S. 51, 55. And this last rule thus by
this court established is also the doctrine upheld by the state
decisions.
In the various state courts of last resort the general rule
wehave just referred to, that a confession must be voluntary,
is generally recognized; although in Indiaiia there is a statute authorizing confessions obtained by inducements to be
given-in evidence to the jury with all the attending circumstances, *except when' made under the influence of fear produced by threats, while it is also provided that a conviction
cannot be had by proof of a confession made under inducement,
"without corroborating testimony." Rev. Stat. Ind. 1881,
1802. - And, ii the Texas Code of Procedurei article '750, it
is [provided that confessions shall not be used against a prisoner at his trial, "if, at the time it was made, the defendant
was in jail or other place of confinement, nor where he was in
custody of an officer, unless such confession be made in the
voluntary statement of 'the~accused,-taken before an examining court in accordance with law; or be made voluntarily,
after having been first cautioned that it may be used against
him; or unless, in connection with such confession, he make
statement of facts or of 'circumstances that are found to be
* true, which conduce to establish his guilt, such .as the finding
of secreted or stolen property, or instrument with which he
states the" offence was committed." " Tex. Rev. Stat. 1879.

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

The English doctrine which restricts the operation of inducements solely to those made by one in authority has been
adopted by some state courts, but disapproved of in others, as
in Ohio. 2pear8 v. State, 2 Ohio St. 583. Whether it is one
which should be followed by. this court in view of the express
terms of the Constitution, need not be now considered, as it
does not arise under the state of facts here presented. In
some it is also held that the fact that the accused is examined
on.oath by a magistrate or coroner, or by a grand jury, with
or without an oath, will, per 8e, exclude confessions, because
of the influence presumed to arise from the authority of the
examining officer or body. People v. .Moifahon, (1857) 15
N. Y. 384, followed in People v. Mondon, (1886) 103 N. Y.

State, (1879) 56 Mississippi, 311, 312; Seate v. Glifford, (1892)
86 Iowa, 550. This doctrine as to examining magistrates is in
some States enforced by statutes somewhat similar in character
to the English statutes. (2 Taylor Ev. § 888, note 2.)
In some of the States it has been held that where questions
are propounded to a prisoner by one having a right to ask
them, and he remains silent, where from the nature of the inquiries, if innocent, reply would naturally be made, the fact
of such silence may be weighed by the jury. See authorities collected in.Ohamberlayne's note to 2 Taylor Ev. 588,
et seq.

Having stated the general lines upon which the American
cases proceed, we will not attempt to review in detail the
numerous decisions in the various courts of last resort in the
several States, treating of confessions in the divergent aspects
in which that doctrine may have presented itself but will eontent ourselves with a brief reference to a few leading and well
considered cases treating of the subject of inducements, and
which are, therefore, apposite to the issue now coiisidered.
In the following cases, the language in each mentioned,
was held to be an inducement sufficient to exclude a confession or statement made in consequence thereof: In Kelly v.
State, (1882) 72 Alabama, 244, saying to the prisoner, "You
have"gt your foot in it, and somebody else was with you;

do is to tell all about it, and to tell who was with you, and to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and; nothing but the truth;"
in People v. Barrie, 49 California, 342, saying to the accused, "it will be better for you to make a full disclosure;"
in People v. Thompson, (1890) 84 California 598, 605, saying
to the accused, "I don't think the truth will hurt anybody.
It Will be better for you to come out and tell all you know
about it, if you feel that way;" in Beery v, United States,
(1893) 2 Colorado, 186, 188, 203, advising the prisoner to
make full restitution, and saying, "if you do so it will go
easy with you.; it.will be better for you to confess; the door
of mercy is open and that of justice closed;" and threatening to arrest the accused and expose his family if he did not
confess; in State v. Bostice, (1845) 4 Harr. (Del.) 563, saying
to one suspected of crime, "the suspicion is general against
you, and you had as -well tell all about it, the prosecution will
be no greater, I don't expect to do anything with you; I am
going to send you home to your mother;" in Green v. State,
(1891) 88 Georgia, 516, saying to the accused, "Edmund, if
you know anything, it may be best for you to tell it;" or,
"Edmund, if you know anything, go and tell it, and it may be
best for you;" in Rector v. Commonwealth, (1882) 80 Kentucky,
46, saying to the prisoner in a case of larceny, "it will go better
with you to tell where the money is, all I want is my money,and. if you will tell me where it is, I will not prosecute you
hard;" in Biscoe v. State, (1887) 67 Maryland, 6, saying to
the accused, " it will be better-for you to tell the truth and
have no more trouble about it;" in Commonwealth v. N ott,
(1883) 135 Mass. 269, saying to the accused, "you had better
own up; I was in the place when you took it; we have got
you down fine; this is not the first you have taken, we have
got other things against, you nearly as good as this;" in Commonwealth v. -fMeyers, (1894) 160 Mass. 530, saying to the accused, "you had better tell the truth;" in People v. WVolcott,
(1883) 51 Michigan, -612, saying, to the. accused, "it will be
better for you to confess;" in Territoi-y v. Underwood, (1888)

Opinion of the Court.

to tell the prosecuting witness all about it, and that the officer
thought the prosecuting witness would withdraw the prosecution or make it as light as possible; in State v. York, (1858)
37 N. H. 175, saying to one under arrest immediately before
a confession, "if you are guilty you had-better own it;" in
People v. Phillips, (1870) 42 N. Y. 200, saying to the prisoner, "The best you can do is to own up; it will be better.
for you;" in State v. WMhiflld, (1874) 70 N. C. 356, saying to
the accused, "I believe you ar6 guilty; if you are you had
better say so; if you are not you had better say 'that;" in
State v. .Drak6, (1893) 113 N. C. 624:, saying to the prisoner,
"if you are guilty, I would advise you to make an honest
confession; it might be easier for you. It is plain against
you;" in Vaughan v. Commonwealth, (1867) 17 Gratt. 576,
saying to the accused, "you had as well tell all about it."
We come, then, to a consideration of the circumstances surrounding, and the facts established to exist, in reference to
the confession, in order to determine whether it was shown to
have been voluntarily made. Before analyzing the statement
of the police detective as to what-took place between himself
and the accused it is necessary to recall the exact situation.
The crime had been committed on the high seas. Brown,
immediately after the homicide, had been arrested by the
crew in consequence of suspicion aroused against him, and had
been by them placed in irons. As the vessel came in sight of
land, and was approaching Halifax, the suspicions of the crew
having been also directed to Brain, he was arrested by them
and placed in irons. On.reaching port, these two suspected
persons were delivered to the custody of the police authorities
of Halifax and were there held in confinement awaiting the
action of the United States consul, whiich was to determine
whether the suspicions which had caused the arrest justified
the sending of one or both of the prisoners into the United
States for formal charge and trial. Before this examination
had taken place the police detective caused Braim to be brought
from jail to his private office, and when there alone with the
detective he was 8strped of his clothing, and either whilst the
detective was in the act of so, stripping him, or after he was

VOL. ctLXVIU-36

OCTOBER' TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

denuded, the conversation offered as a confession took place.
The detective repeats what he said to the prisoner, whom he
had thus stripped, as follows:
"When Mr. -Brain came into my office I said to him:
'Brain, we are trying to unravel this horrible mystery.' 'I
said: I Your position is rather an awkward one. I have had
Brown in this' office, and he made a statement that he saw
you do the murder.' He said: 'He could not have seen me.
Where was he V I said: 'He states he was at the wheel.'
'Well,' he said, 'he could not see me from there."'
The fact, then, is, that the language of the accused, which
was offered in evidence as a confession, was made use of by
him as a reply to the statement of the detective that Bramn's
co-suspect had charged him with the crime, and, although the
answer was in the form of a denial, it was doubtless offered
as a confession because of an implication of guilt which it was
conceived the words of the denial might be considered to
mean. But the situation of the accused, and the nature of the
communication made to him by the detective, necessarily.
overthrows any possible implication that his reply to the detective could have been the result of a purely voluntary mental action; that is to say, when all the surrounding circumstances are considered in their true relations, not only is the
claim that the statement was voluntary overthrown, but the
.impressi6n is irresistiblyproduced that it must necessarily have
been the result of either hope or fear, or both, operating on
the mind.
It cannot be doubted that, placed in the position in which
the accused was when the statement was made to him that
the other suspected person had charged him with crime, the
result was to produce upon his mind the fear that if he remained silent it would be considered an admission of guilt,
and therefore render certain his being committed for trial as
the guilty person, and it cannot be conceived that the converse
'impression would not also have iaturally arisen, that by denying there was hope of removing the suspicion from himself.
If this must -have been the state of mind of one situated as
was the prisoner when the confession was made, how in reason

BRA

v. UINITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

can it be said that the answer which he gave and which was
required by the situation was wholly voluntary and in no
manner influenced by the force of hope or fear? To so conclude would be to deny the necessary relation of cause and
effect. Indeed, the implication of guilt resulting from silence
has been considered by some state courts of last resort, in
decided cases, to which we have already made reference, as so
cogent that they have held that where a person is accused of
guilt, under circumstances which call upon him to make
denial, the fact of his silence is competent evidence hs tending
to establish guilt. Whilst it must not be considered that by
referring to these authorities we approve them, it is yet mani-.
fest that if learned judges have deduced the conclusion that
silence is so weighty as to create an inference of guilt, it cannot, with justice, be said that the mind of one who is held in
custody under suspicion of having committed a crime, would
not be impelled to say something, when informed by one in
authority that a co-suspect had declared that he had seen the
person to whom the officer was addressing himself, commit
the offence, when otherwise he might have remained silent
but for fear of the consequences which might ensue; that is
to say, he would be impelled to speak either for fear that his
failure to make answer would be considered against him, or
of hope that if he did reply be wotild be benefited thereby.
And these self-evident deductions are greatly strengthened by
considering the place where the statements were made and
the conduct of the detective towards the accused. Brain had
been brought from confinement to the office of the detective,
and there, when alone with him, in a foreign land, while he
was in the act of being stripped or had been stripped of his
clothing, was interrogated by the officer, who was thus, while
putting the questions and receiving answers thereto, exercising
complete authority and control over the person he was interrogating. Although these facts may not, when isolateq each
from the other, be sufficient to warrant the inference that an
influence compelling a statement had been exerted, yet when
taken as a whole, in conjunction with the nature of the communication made, they give room to the strofigest inference

OCTOBER TER , 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

that the statements of Brain were not made by one who in
law could be considered a free agent. To communicate to a
person suspected of the commission of crimelthe fact that his
co-suspect has stated that he has seen him commit the offence,
to make this statement to him under circumstances which call
imperatively for an admission or denial and to accompany
the communication with conduct which necessarily-perturbs the
mind and engenders confusion of thought, and then to use the
denial made by the person so situated as a confession, because
of the form in which the denial is made, is not only to compel the reply but to produce the confusion of words supposed
to be found in it, and then use statements thus brought into
being for the conviction of the accused. 'A plainer violation
as well of the letter as of the spirit and. purpose of the constitutional immunity could scarcely be conceived of.
Moreover, aside from the natural result arising from the
situation of the accused and the communication made to him
by the detective, the conversation conveyed an express intimation rendering .the confession involuntary within the rule
laid down by the authorities. What further was said by the
detective? "Now, look here, Brain, I am satisfied that you
killed the captain from all I have heard from Mr. Brown.
But," I said, "some of us here think you could not have done
all that crime alone. If you had an accomplice, you should say
so, and not have the blame of this horrible crime on your own.
shoulders." But how could the weight of $he whole crime
be removed from .the shoulders 'of the prisoner as a consequence of his speaking, unless benefit as to the crime and its
punishment was to arise from his speaking? Conceding that,
closely analyzed, the hope of benefit which the conversation
suggested was that of the removal from the conscience of the
prisoner of the merely moral weight resulting from concealment, and therefore would not be' an inducement, we are to
consider the import of 'the conversation, not from a mere
abstract point of view, but by the light of the impression that
it was calculated to produce on the mind of the accused, situated as he was at the time the conversation took place. Thus
viewed, the weight to be removed by speaking naturally im-

BRAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

ported a suggestion of some benefit as to the. crime and its
punishment as arising from making a statement.
This is greatly fortified by a consideration of the words
which preceded this language -that is, that Brown had declared he had witnessed the homicide, and that the detective
had said he believed the prisoner was guilty and had an
accomplice. It, in substance, therefore, called upon the prisoner to disclose his accomplice, and might well have been
understood as holding out an encouragement that by so doing
he might at least obtain a mitigation of the punishment for
the crime which otherwise would assuredly follow. As said
in the passage from Russell on Crimes already quoted, "the
law cannot measure the force of the influence used or decideupon its effect" upon the mind of the prisoner, and, therefore,
excludes the declaration if any degree of influence has been
exerted." In the case before us we find that an influence was
exerted, and as any doubt as to whether the confession was
voluntary must be. determined in favor of the accused, we
cannot escape the conclusion that error was committed by the
trial court in admitting the confession under the circumstances
disclosed by the record.
Our conclusion that the confession was wrongfully admitted
renders it unnecessary to pass on the serious question arising
from the ruling of the trial court by which in cross-examination the accused was denied the right to ask the detective as
to an article of personal property taken from the prisoner at
the time the alleged confession was had. In other words, that
the accused could not bring out by way of cross-examination
everything which took place at the time of the alleged confession, but was compelled, in order to do so, to make the detective his own witness, and therefore be placed in the position
where he could not impeach him. We are also, as the result
of our conclusion on the subject of the confession, relieved
from examining the many other assignments of error, -xcept
in so far as they present questions which are likely to arise on
the new trial.
We will now briefly, consider the alleged errors of this
6haracter.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

By plea and suppleiental plea in abatement, and by motion
to quash, defendant, preliminary to the trial, attacked the
sufficiency of the indictment, because one of the grand jurors
was permitted to affirm and the indictment failed to state that
such juror was "conscientiously scrupulous" of being sworn,
and because the indictment recited that it was presented upon
the "oath" of the jurors, when, in fact,, it was presented upon
the oath and a//f rmation of the jurors. At the hearing of the
.pleas in abatement, it appeared that whenf'the grand jurors
were empanelled one of them, upon being called to be sworn,
stated that he affirmed, and declined to take an oath, and after
his fellows had been regularly sworn he was formally affirmed
to the same duties specified in the oath administered to the
others. It is also stated in the record, following the recital
of the issuance of venires for grand and petit jurors, that"In obedience to the said order of cou.rt, and to the venires
issued thereunder, the following-named grand jurors attended
on the fifteenth day of October, A.D. 1896. On that day the
said grand jurors were duly empanelled as the grand jury
for the October term of this court, A.D. 1896. All of said
grand jurors, being empanelled aforesaid, were duly sworn,
except grand juror William Merrill, Junior, of West Tewbury, who duly affirmed, twenty-one grand jurors being in
attendance."
In section 1 of the, Revised Statutes of the United States it.
is provided, among other things, that, in determining the meaning of the Revised Statutes, "a requirement of an I oath ' shall
be deemed complied with by making affirmation in judicial
form." Section 800 also provides that"Jurors to serve in the courts of the United States, in each
State respectively, shall have the same qualifications, subject
to the provisions thereinafter contained, and be entitled to the
same exemptions, as jurors of the highest court of law in such
State may have and be entitled to at the time when such
jurors for service in the courts -of the United States are summoned ; and they shall be designated by ballot, lot, or otherwise, according to the mode of forming such juries then
practised in such state courts, so far as such may be practica-

BRAAM v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

ble by 'the courts of the United States or the officers thereof.
And for this purpose the said courts may, by rule or order,
conform the designation and empanelling of juries, in substance, to the laws and usages relating to jurors, in the state
courts, from time to time in force in such State. This section
shall not apply to juries to serve in the courts of the United
States in Pennsylvania."
The Public Statutes of Massachusetts, 1882, chap. 213, section 6, provide as follows:
"S crrioH 6. When a person returned as grand juror is conscientiously scrupulous of taking the oath before prescribed,
he shall be allowed to make affirmation, substituting the word
' affirm' instead of the word Iswear,' and also the words -1this
you do under the pains 4nd penalties of perjury' instead of
the words 'so help you God.'"
And section 3 of chapter 3 of the same statutes provides as

follows (p. 58):
"In the construction of statutes the following rules shall be
observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with
the manifest intent of the general court or repugnant to the
context of the same statute, that is to say, . . . Fourteenth. The word ' oath ' shall include ' affirmation' in cases
where, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an
oath."
The objection that the indictment recited that it was presented "upon the oath" of the jurors, when the fact was that
it was presented upon the "oath and affirmation" of the jurors,
is without merit. Waiving a consideration of the question
whether, under the provisions of the statutes to which reference has been made, the word "oath" might not properly be
construed as meaning either "oath" or." affirmation," the recital alluded to was purely formal, and if defective was open to
amendment. The record disclosing the fact that all of the
grand jurors were duly sworn except grand juror 'William
Merrill, Junior, who was "duly affirmed," the defendant could
not have been prejudiced by the form of the statement made in
the indictment, and the defect, if any, was rendered harmless
by the curative prpvisions of section 1025, Revised Statutes.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

The further objection that neither in the indictment nor in
the proof at the hearing of the pleas in abatement was it
affirmatively stated or shown that grand juror Merrill, before
being permitted to affirm, was proven to have possessed conscientious scruples against taking an oath, is practically concluded by the disposition made of the objection just passed
upon, and is rendered nugatory by the terms of § 1025, IRevised Statutes. Further, the mode of ascertaining the existence or non-existence of such conscientious scruples was committed to. the discretion of the officer who affirmed the juror,
and such affirmation conclusively established that the officer
had properly exercised his discretion. Commonwealth v.
Fisher,I Gray, 492; State v. Adams, '18 Maine, 486.
The remaining assignments 'vhich we deem it proper to
notice relate to the overruling of objections interposed to
questions propounded to certain witnesses in the character of
experts. 'Some of these objections were made to hypothetical
questions asked a number of sailors, reciting the condition of
things assumed to-have been established by the evidence as
,existing about the time of the killing, viz., the .speed of the
Herbert Fuller, the condition of her sails, direction of wind,
etc., an inquiry as to the effect it would have on the vessel
if the wheelman had taken his hands off the wheel, and what
effect would be produced by lashing the wheel under similar
conditions. These questions were evidently intended to supplement the testimony of Brown, who swore that he stood
with both hands on the wheel during the time between twelve
and two o'clock, and, consequently, when the murders were
committed. The questions were competent, as the testimony
sought to be elicited was relevant to the issue. Aside from.
the testimony of Brown the evidence against Brain was purely
circumstantial, and it was clearly proper for the Government to
endeavor to establish, as a circumstance in the case, the fact that
another person who was present in the vicinity at the time of
the killing, could not have committed -the crime. The testimony sought to be adduced had this tendency, and the fact
that it might-operate indirectly to fortify the credit of such person as a witness in the cause could not affect its admissibility.

An objection to a question asked of a medical, witness,
whether, in his opinion, a man standing at the hip of a recumbent person and striking blows on that person's head and
forehead with an axe would necessarily be spattered with, or
covered with, some of the blood, was also properly overruled.
We think the assumed facts recited in the question were warranted by the proof in the case, and that the evidence-sought
to be elicited from the witness was of a character justifying
an expression of opinion by the witness, the jury after all
being at liberty to give to the evidence such weight as in their
judgment it was entitled to. Ropt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430.

JusTicE

I dissent from the' opinion and judgment in this case
First, because I think the testimony was not open to objebtion. "A confession, if freely and voluntarily made, is evidence of the most.satisfactory, character." -l'opt v. Utah, 110
U. S. 574, 581; reaffirmed in Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S.
'51, 55. The fact that the defendant was in custody and in
irons does not destroy the competency 6f a confession. "Confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify
the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the prisoner in fear,
or by promises." Sparf v. United States, supra; see also
Wilson v. United States, 162 1U. S. 613, 623.

The witness Power, whdn called, testified positively that no
threats were made nor any inducements held out to Brain,
and this general declaration he affirmed and reaffirmed in
response to inquiries made by the court and the defendant's
counsel. The court, therefore, properly overruled the objection at that time made to his testifying to the statements of
defendant. It is not suggested that there was error in this
ruling, and the fact that inducements were held out is deduced
only from the testimony subsequently given by Power of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Brewer, J., Fuller, C.J., Brown, J.

conversation between him and Brain. The first part of that
conversation is as follows: "When Mr. Brain came into my
office, I said to him: ' Bram, we are trying to unravel this
horrible mystery.' I said: ' Your position is rather an awkward one. I have had Brown in this office, and he made
a statement that he saw you do the murder.' He said: 'IHe
could not have seen me; where was he ?' I said: ' He states
he was at the wheel.' 'Well,' he said, 'he could not see me
from there."' In this there is nothing which by any possibility
can be tortured into a suggestion of threat or a temptation of
hope. Power simply stated the obvious fact that they were
trying to unravel a horrible mystery, and the further fact
that Brown had charged the defendant with the crime, and
the replies of Brain were given as freely and voluntarily as it
is possible to conceive.
It is strange to hear it even intimated that Brain up to this
time was impelled by fear or allured by hope caused in the
slightest degree by these statements of Power.
The balance of the conversation is as follows: "I said,
'Now, look here, Brain, I am satisfied that you killed the
captain from all I have heard from Mr. Brown.. But,' I said,
'some of us here think you could not have done all that
crime alone. If you had an accomplice, you should say so,
and not have the blame of this horrible crime on your own
shoulders.' He said: 'Well, I think, and many others on
board the ship think, that Brown is the murderer; but I don't
know anything about it.' He was rather short in his replies."
And here, it is argued, was a suggestion of a benefit-the
holding out of a hope that a full disclosure might somehow
inure to his advantage. To support this contention involves
a refinement of analysis which, while it may show marvellous
metaphysical ability,- is of little weight in practical affairs.
But even if it did carry any such improper suggestion it was
made at nearly the close of the conversation, and that this
suggestion then made had a retroactive effect and transformed
the previous voluntary statements of Brain into statements
made under the influence of fear or hope, is a psychological
process which I am unable to comprehend. The only reply

BBAM v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Brewer, J., Fuller, C.J., Brown, 3.

which Brain made to the question containing this supposed
improper suggestion was this: "Well, I tbink, and many
others on board the ship think, that Brown is the murderer;
but I don't know anything about it." Can it for a moment
be thought that such a reply was so significant that, permitting
it to go to the jury, compels the putting at naught this protracted trial, and overthrowing the deliberate verdict of the
twelve men who heard the evidence and condemned the
defendant? [With all respect to my *brethren who are of a
different opinion, I can but think that- such a contention is
wholly unsound, and that in all this conversation with Brain
there was nothing of sufficient importance to justify the
reversal of the judgment.
Again, there is a lack .of any proper objection or exception, and if, there is any one thing which may be considered as
settled in all appellate courts it is that an error in the admission of testimony will not be considered unless there was a
specific objection and exception at the trial. "To authorize
any objection to the admission or exclusio. of evidence, or to
the giving or refusal of 'any instructions to the jury, to be
heard in this court, the record must disclose not merely the
fact that the objection was taken in the court below, but that
the parties excepted at the time to the action of the court
thereon." Hutchins v. King, I Wall. 53, 60; United States
v. 7McMasters, 4 Wall. 680, 682. "Our power is confined to
exceptions actually taken at the trial." -Railway Company v.

error in criminal cases, but the law is equally applicable to
the latter. "'It is the duty of counsel seasonably to call the
attention of the court to any error in empanelling the jury, in
admitting testimony, or in any other proceeding during the
trial, by which*his rights are prejudiced, and in case of an
adverse ruling to note an exception." Alexander v. United
States, 138 U. S. 353, 355. "The general rule undoubtedly is
that an. objection should be so framed as to indicate the precise point upon which the court is asked to rule." Sparf v.
United States, 156 U. S. 51, 56; Holder v. United States, 150
.X. S. 91; Tucker v. United States, 151 U. S. 164.
It is true the defendant objected to the admission of the
conversation before it was given, but upon the state of facts
as then presented unquestionably the trial court ruled properly
in permitting the witness to testify, for he positively declared
that there was neither threat nor promise, intimidation or
inducement. If it be true, as the court now holds, that in the
progress of his testimony it was develdped that he- did make
a statement which carried an inducement - a suggestion
of hope - it was then- the duty of the' defendant to call
the attention of the court to the matter, either by objecting
to any further disclosures of the conversation, or else by a
motion to strike out. :Nothing of the kind took place. Defendant was apparently content to let all of the subsequent
conversation come in. Can it be held that the court erred in
not of its own motion stopping the witness, or striking out the
testimony, or instructing the jury to disregard it, when defendant'asked nothing of the kind ? Surely by this decision
we practically overrule the long line of authorities heretofore
cited affirming the necessity of calling the attention of the
trial court to the specific matter, obtaining its ruling thereon
ahd saving an exception thereto before there is any jurisdiction in this court to review. Nor is this a mere technical
and arbitrary rule which may be dispensed with whenever the
exigencies of any case seem to demand, and in no other way a
ground for reversal can be discovered. It may be, and, undoubtedly, often is the case, that though incompetent testimony
be given *thedefendant prefers that it shall remain in order,

for certain purposes, to take advantage of it in the argument
before the jury. Can it be possible that he may obtain this
advantage, and, having obtained and used it,. insist that,
because of such incompetent testimony, he is entitled to a
reversal of the judgment against him? Wilson v. United
,States, 162 U. S. 613, 624. Who shall say that this defendant,
though at first objecting to any testimony respecting his
statements, yet, after hearing what the witness said, did not
prefer that such testimony remain, as it disclosed that, at the
very first moment he was informed that Brown charged him
with the crime,,he protested that Brown was not in a position where he could see who did the killing? Indeed, for
anything in this record to the contrary, he, when a witness in
his own behalf, may have given the same version of the conversation, and admitted that his statements were voluntarily
made. Who shall say that he did not wish to argue before
the jury. that the claim made of"Brown's inability to see what
took place was not an excuse suggested only by the exigencies
of the trial, but was presented at the iery first moment of the
charge; and if he was willing to let the testimony remain and
!have all the advantage which he could take of it in argument
before the jury, can it be that he can now come to this court
and say "true I did not object to this specific testimony, nor
ask to have it stricken out, *but it was incompetent," and
obtain a reversal on the ground of its admission ?
I dissent, therefore, first, because I think the testimony was
properly received; and, secondly, because no motion was
made to strike it out and no exception taken to its admission.
