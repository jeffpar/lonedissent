19,1 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

SUN PRINTING AND PU-BLISHING ASSOCIATION v.
EDWARDS.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 239.

Argued April 20, 1904.-Decided May 16, 1904.

An allegation in the complaint, which is admitted by the answer that defendant is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of a designated State and having its principal office therein is a
sufficient averment as to defendant's citizenship.
In determining, on certified question of jurisdiction from the Circuit Court
of Appeals, whether diverse citizenship exists, the whole record may be
looked to for the purpose of curing a defective averment, and if the requisite citizenship is anywhere averred in the record, or facts are therein
stated whicl in legal intendment constitute such allegation, that is sufficient.
Where the court is satisfied, in the light of all the testimony, that an averment of residence in a designated State was intended to mean, and, reasonably construied must be interpreted as averring, that plaintiff was a
citizen of that State, it is sufficient.
THE

facts, which involved the sufficiency of a-verments and

proof of diverse citizenship to maintain the jurisdiction of
the United States Circuit Court, are stated in the opinion of
the court.
Mr. FranklinBartlett for plaintiff in error:

The complaint is defective. Citizenship and residence are
not synonymous terms, Parkerv. Overman, 18 I-ow. 141; Robertson v. Cease, 97 U. S.' 648; Abererombie v. Dupuis, 1 Cr.

citizenship. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649.

Mr. Thomias F. 4iayard for defendant in error:
If the diversity of citizenship affirmatively appears upon
the record, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court must be af*firmed. Robertson v. Cease, 97 U. S. 646; Grace v. American

in error is a citizen of the State of New York in the Southern
Distri f of New York.

MR. JUSTICE WHiTE delivered the opinion of the court.
The certificate of the United States Circuit-Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit is as follows:
"This cause comes here upon a writ of error to review a
judgment of the Circuit Court, Southern District of New York,
entered upon the verdict of a jury in favor of defendant in
error, who was plaintiff below. Upon examination of the
record it appears that, in addition to various questions as to
the merits of the controversy which are presented by the assignments of error, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is in
issue. Under sections 5 and 6 of the act of March ', 1891,
writs of error in such cases are to be taken direct to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

194 U. S.

Supreme Court, and the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the
Circuit Courts of Appeal does not include such cases.
"In accordance therefore, with the practice indicated in
Cincinnati, Hamilton & D. Co. v. Thiebaud, 177 U. S. 615,
and Am. Sugar Co. v. New Orleans, 181 U. S. 277, and followed by this court in United States v. Lee Yen Tai, 113 Fed.
Rep. 465, this court elects to reserve judgment upon the
other questions and to certify the question of jurisdiction to
the Supreme Court.
"Statement of Facts.
"The facts out of which the question of jurisdiction arises
are as follows:
"The action is for breach of contract of employment.
The complaint avers and the answer admits that defendant
is a domestic corporation, duly organized and existing under
the laws of New York, having its principal office for the
transaction of business in the Southern District of New York.
The complaint further avers and the answer admits that
'plaintiff is a resident of the State of Delaware.' Upon the
trial the plaintiff testified:.' I started in the printing business
about thirty years ago. . . . I have been on the New
York Tribune, on the World, the Philadelphia Record and the
American Press Association . . . I had charge of the
Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware. . . . In this city

[New York] I worked on the New York Tribune, on the Sun,
..
on the World, and in the American Press Association
Just prior to my going to work upon the New York Sun [under the contract in suit] I was the publisher and business
manager of the Evening Journal of Wilmington, Delawhre, and
president of the company.

.

.

.

[After my discharge from

the employ of the Sun] I finally secured a place with the New
Haven Palladium, and I was there a while. . . . One of
the reasons I left the New Haven Palladium was that it was
too far away from home. I lived in Delaware and I had to
go back and forth. My family were over in Delaware.'

SUN PRINTING & PUBLISHING ASSN. v. EDWARDS. 381
194 U.S.

Opinion of the Court."

"There was no other testimony in any way bearing upon
the plaintiff's residence or citizenship.
"The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was not questioned
by the defendant in the court below, and the assignments of
error do not present any such question.
"Question Certified.
"Upon the facts above set forth, the question of law concerning which this court desires the instruction of the Supreme
Court is:
"' Had the Circuit Court jurisdiction of the controversy
between plaintiff and defendant ?'
"In accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the act
of March 3, 1891, establishing Courts of Appeal, etc., the foregoing question of law is by the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit hereby certified to the Supreme Court."
In the argument at bar on behalf of the Sun Printing and
Publishing Association, the plaintiff in error in the Circuit
Court of Appeals, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court over
the controversy was denied, not only upon the hypothesis that
Edwards, the plaintiff, was not alleged or shown to have been
a citizen of Delaware, but also upon the assumption that the
Sun Association was not averred to have been a citizen of
New York. The latter contention may be at once dismissed
from view, because the allegation of the complaint, admitted
by the answer, " that defendant is a domestic corporation,
duly organized and existing under the laws of New York, having its principal office for the transaction of business in the
Southern District of New York," clearly imported that the
corporation was originally created by the State of New York.
The presumption necessarily followed that the corporation was
composed of citizens of that State, and consequently the corporation was entitled to sue or be sued in the courts of the
United States as a citizen of New York. Southern Ry. Co. v.
Allison, 190 U. S. 326.
We come to the contention that the citizenship of Edwards

Opinion of the Court.

194 U. S.

was not averred in the complaint or shown by the record, and
hence jurisdiction did not appear.
In answering the question, whether the Circuit Court had
jurisdiction of the controversy, we must put ourselves in the
place of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and decide the question
with reference to the transcript of record in that court.
Had the transcript shown nothing more as to the status of
Edwards than the averment of the complaint that he was a
"resident of the State of Delaware," as such an averment would
not necessarily have imported that Edwards was a citizen of
Delaware, a negative answer would have been impelled by
prior decisions. Mexican Central Ry. Co. v. Duthie, 189 U. S.
76; Home v. George H. Hammond Co., 155 U. S. 393 ; Denny
v. Pironi,141 U. S. 121 ; Robertson v.Cease, 97 U. S. 646. The
whole record, however, may be looked to, for the purpose of
curing a defective averment of citizenship, where jurisdiction in a Federal court is asserted to depend upon diversity of citizenship, and if the requisite citizenship, is anywhere
expressly averred in the record, or facts are therein stated which
in legal intendment constitute such allegation, that is sufficient.
Home v. George H. Hammond Co., supra, and cases cited.
As this is an action at law, we are bound to assume that the
testimony of the plaintiff contained in the certificate of the
Circuit Court of Appeals, and recited to have been given on
the trial, was preserved in a bill of exceptions, which formed
part of the transcript of record filed 'in the Circuit Court of
Appeals. Being a part of the record, and proper to be resorted to in settling a question of the character of that now
under consideration, Robertson v. Cease, 97 U. S.646, 648, we
come to ascertain what is established by the uncontradicted
evidence
to.
In the referred
first place, it shows that Edwards, prior to his
employment on the New York Sun and the New Haven Palladium,
was legally domiciled in the State of Delaware. Next, it demonstrates that he had no intention to abandon such domicil
for he testified under oath as follows : "One of the reasons I

SUN PRINTING & PUBLISHING ASSN. v. EDWAIRDS. 383
194 U.. S.

Opinion of the Court.

left the New Haven Palladium was, it was too far away from
home. I lived in Delaware, and I had to go back and forth. My
family are over in Delaware." Now, it is elementary that, to
effect a change of one's legal domicil, two things are indispensable: First, residence in a new domicil ; and, second, the intention
to remain there. The change cannot be made, except facto et
animo. Both are alike necessary. Either without the other
is insufficient. Mere absence from a fixed home, however long
continued, cannot work the change. Mitchell v. United States,
21 Wall. 350.
As Delaware must, then, be held to have been the legal domicil of Edwards at the time he commenced this action, had it
appeared that he was a citizen of the United States, it would
have resulted, by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment,
that Edwards was also a, citizen of the State of Delaware.
Anderson v. Watt, 138 U. S. 694. Be this as it may, however,
Delaware being the legal domicil of Edwards, it was impossible
for him to have been a citizen of another State, District or
Territory; and he must then have been either a citizen of
Delaware or a citizen or subject of a foreign State. In either
of these contingencies, the Circuit Court would have had
jurisdiction over the controversy. But, in the light of the
testimony, we ae satisfied that the averment in the complaint,
that Edwards was a resident "of" the State of Delaware, was
intended to mean, and, reasonably construed, must be interpreted as averring, that the plaintiff was a citizen'of the State of
Delaware. Jones v. Andrews, 10 Wall. 327, 331; Express Company v. Kountze, 8 Wall. 342.
The question is answered in the affirmative,and it will be so certified.

and MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM dissented.
