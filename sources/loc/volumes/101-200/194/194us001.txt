PEOPLE'S GAS LIGHT AND COKE COMPANY v. CHICAGO.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF TII.E UNITED STATES FOR
THE

NORTHERN

DISTRICT

OF ILLINOIS.

No. 132. Argued January 20, 1904.--Decided April 4,1904.

Where the contract claimed to have been impaired was made with one of
several cor)orations merged into the complainant, and concededly affects
only the property and franchises originally belonging to such constituent
company, divisional relief cannot be granted affecting only such property
when the bill is not framed in that. aspect but prays for a suspension of the
'impairing ordinance as to all of complainant's property.
The rule, that a special statutory exemption does not pass to a new corporation succeeding others by consolidation or purchase in the absence of express direction to that effect in the statute, is applicable where the constituent oinpapies are held and operated by one of them, under authority
of the Legislature.
Even if the asserted exemption from change of rates existed and had not
been lost by consolidation, the bill cannot be sustained where no such
contract rights as alleged have been impaired or destroyed by the ordinance.

THE facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. William D. Guthrie, with whom Mr. James F. Meagher
and Mr. William F. Sheehan were on the brief, for appellant:
The fundamental allegation of the bill was that the ordinance
of October 15, 1900, impaired the obligation of the charter

contract which bound the legislature not to authorize the city
council of Chicago to compel the People's Company to furnish
gas at a less rate than three dollars per thousand feet. The
city claimed that it had been duly authorized to pass the
or(inance under and by virtue of the City and Village Act
of 1872. Hence the controversy. Thus the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court was based solely upon the ground that the
suit was one arising under the Constitution of the United
States. IValla JValla Case, 172 U. S. 1, 10; Joplin v. Light
Company, 191 U. S. 150, 158.
A court of equity has jurisdiction to restrain the enforcement of a void ordinance where such relief will avoid a multiplicity of suits and where there is no sufficient or adequate
remedy at law for the protection of property interests. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, 185 U. S. 65, 82; Detroit v.

Many millions of the capital of the People's Company have
been invested in its plant for manufacturing and distributing
gas. The State and city and the inhabitants of Chicago have
had the full benefit of the contract. The provision in question
is plainly a part, and an important part, of the contract between the State and the People's Company. Such an enactment is a contract and justice and good policy alike require
that the protection of the law should be assured to it. The

same effect.
The city's consent in the ordinance of 1858 was equally
extensive and embraced "any of the streets, avenues, highways, public parks or squares throughout said city. " Such
a consent extends to every existing and every new street,
and is in perpetuity. People ex rel. IVoodharcn Gas Co. v.

Central Railroad v. Chicago, 176 U. S. 646, 666. See also
Chicago Gas Light Co. v. People's Gas Light Co., 121 Illinois, 530, 538. It was, therefore, the legislature and not
the city council that granted the franchise which extended to
the whole city.
The complainants were entitled to partial relief, if not to all,
that was prayed for.
The demurrer was general and covered the whole bill, and if
any part of the bill was good, the demurrer necessarily failed
and should have been overruled. Such has long been the
established practice in equity. Tivington v. Story, 9 Pet.
632, 658; Pacific R. R. of Mo. v. Missouri JPac. Ry., 111 U. 8,

To hold now that the ordinance is nevertheless to operate
only in portions of the city, depending upon the history of the
pipes throtigh which the gas is supplied, would be to decree
what the city council never intended to accomplish and would
be judicial legislation beyond the power of any court. Spraigue

Where a municipality has exclusive control over its streets,
it may grant rights in them upon such reasonable terms as it
may see fit, including a limitation on the charges which the
party using the'streets may require the public to pay for the
services rendered. Such a limitation of charges is merely an
exercise of the contractual powers of a municipality, and has
nothing whatever to do with its police power, or with any
power analogous thereto. People v. Suburban R. R. Co., 178

Argument for Appellee.

194 U. S.

Mr. Granville W. Browning, with whom Mr. Edgar Bronson
Tolman was on the brief, for appellee:
Appellant has no contract, either by virtue of its charter
act of 1865 or of any provision of the gas consolidation act of
1897, whereby the city council is prohibited from reducing
the price of gas to a reasonable sum.
The claim by such a company that it has a contract granting
it immunity from regulation as to rates will not be allowed
unless the surrender by the public is made by explicit and unmistakable language. The surrender will never be sustained
by implication and will never be established by ambiguous
terms. An ambiguous phrase must always be interpreted in
favor of the public. To this effect are the following cases:
Georgia Banking Co. v. Smith, 128 U. S. 174; FreeportWater
Co. v. Freeport City, 180 U. S. 587; Covington & Lexington
Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578; Charles River Bridge

Kentucky, 173 U. S. 231; Chi. Mil. & St. Paul Ry. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418.
The legislature has the right to fix the rates charged by
those corporations serving: the public, as gas companies, water
companies, railroads and the like, the only limit being that, as
regulated, they must be reasonable. Where the right has been
reserved in the city, as in this case, the same rule prevails.

If the pretended immunity claimed to be derived from the act
of 1865 were not wiped out by the terms of section 9, immunities
from public regulation enjoyed by constituent companies do
not go to consolidated companies or successor companies, or
to companies that succeed by purchase, assignment, foreclosure, or any other form of transfer, except by explicit language. Such an immunity is personal to the original corporation and does not pass. Unless there is express language to
the contrary in the original charter or in the statute permitting
the merger, etc., immunities belonging to the old company do
not pass by sale, assignment, foreclosure, merger, etc. Memphis &c. R. R. v. Commissioners, 112 U. S. 609; Wilson v.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a bill to restrain the city of Chicago from putting in
force a general ordinance passed October 15, 1900, providing
that corporations, companies or persons manufacturing, selling
and distributing gas in the city of Chicago for illuminating or
fuel purposes should not charge individual consumers more
than seventy-five cents per thousand cubic feet, and providing

penalties for violation of its provisions. The bill was demurred to, and an opinion delivered on hearing on demurrer
114 Fed. Rep. 384.
The opinion took a wider range than the bill as framed called
for, because of certain facts not therein set forth, but which
were admitted on the argument, and accordingly it was suggested that the bill be amended to bring in these facts, and,
this having been done, the demurrer Was renewed to the
amended bill, whereupon, after argument, the court gave an
additional brief opinion, (which appears in the record,) sustained the demurrer andilisiissed the bill as amended for want
of jurisdiction. Subsequently it was stipulated and agreed
by and between the parties that the decree. as entered did not
correctly recite what was intended by the court, and that it
should be amended by striking out the words "for want of
jurisdiction,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "upon the
ierits as to the alleged contract rights of the complainant, but
without prejudice to any other suit in respect to the question
of power of the city council under the ,laws of the State of
Illinois." An order was then entered by the court, amending
its previous decree nunc pro tunc in 'the particulars named.
The facts presented by the amended bill were these: The
People's Gas Light and Coke Company vas incorporated by a
special act of the general assembly of Illinois, approved February 12, 1855, creating it a corporation, with the usual powers
and liabilities, with a capital stock not to exceed $500,000, and
with power to manufacture and sell gas in the city of Chicago
and "to lay pipes for the purpose of conducting the gas in any
of the streets or avenues of said ,city, with the consent of the
city council," and by the fourth section it was expressly provided that the company should furnish and supply to the city,
for its public uses, at the election of the proper authorities of
the city, "a sufficient supply of gas, at a rate. not exceeding
two dollars per thousand feet, and the inhabitants of said city
at a rate not exceeding two dollars and fifty cents per thousand
feet." The city council passed an ordinance, August 30, 1858,

PEOPLE'S GAS LIGHT & COKE CO. v. CHICAGO.

Opinion of the Court.

granting the company permission and authority "to lay their
gas mains, pipes, feeders and service pipes in any of the streets,
avenues, highways, public parks or squares throughout said
city, subject at all times, however, to the resolutions and ordinances of the common council of said city." The act of 1855
was amended February 7, 1865, so as to allow an indefinite
increase of the capital stock, and by section three of this act
all the corporate powers of the corporation were vested in a
board of directors and such officers and agents as the board
should appoint, with power to the board to "adopt such bylaws, rules and regulations for the government of said corporation and the management of its affairs and business as they
may think proper, not inconsistent with the laws of this State,"
the section continuing and concluding, "and the fourth section
of said act is hereby repealed; but ten years after the passage
of this act the common council of the city of Chicago may, by
resolution or ordinance, regulate the prices charged by said
company for gas; but said common council of the city of
Chicago, shall,, in no case, be authorized to compel the said
company to furnish gas at a less rate than three dollars.per
thousand feet."
In 1870 a new constitution of the State of Illinois was
adopted, providing that no law "making any irrevocable grant
of special privileges or immunities shall be passed," Art. II,
§ 14; that the getieral assembly should not pass local or special
laws "granting to any corporation, dssociation,"or individual
any special or exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise
whatever," Art, IV, § 22; and that no corporation should be
"created by special laws, or its charter extended, changed, or
amended, except those for charitable, educational, penal, or
reformatory purposes, which are to be and remain under the
patronage and control of the State, but the general assembly
shall provide, by general laws, for the organization of all corporations hereafter to be created," Art. XI, § 1.
June 5, 1897, an act was passed "in relation to gas companies," which authorized and empowered gas companies to

sell, transfer, convey or lease their real and personal property,
rights, franchises and privileges, in whole or in part, to any
other gas company doing business in the same city, town or
village and provided that .y complying with the provisions
of the act, gas companies doing business in the same city, town
or village might consolidate and merge into a single corporation,
which should be one of said merging and consoli dating corporations. "The companies, parties to the agreement or agreements, which provide for consolidation and merger shall thereupon be and are hereby declared to be consolidated and merged
into the one corporation specified in such agreement or agreements," Laws Illinois, 1897, p. 179, §§ 2, 8.
The ninth and eleventh sect-5ns read as follows:
"§ 9. Any corporation purchasing or leasing the real and
personal property of any other company or companies, as provided for in section 1, or any consolidated corporation, as authorized by section 2, shall be subject to and shall perform, for
each of the companies so entering into said agreement-or agreements, the legal obligations now resting upon each of them,
respectively, under their respective charters and ordinances,
except where the provisions thereof conflict with the exercise
of the powers herein granted, in the same manner and to the
same extent as if the companies had remained individual and
distinct; and such performance by said corporation so purchasing or leasing, or by such consolidated corporafion, shall
be held and considered as the performance by each of the respective companies so selling, leasing or consolidating, of the
legal obligations theretofore resting upon each of them respectively: Provided, however, that nothing in this act shall be
construed as extinguishing said companies entering into the
agreement or agreements mentioned in this act, or annulling
or impairing any of their respective franchises, licenses or
privileges, but they shall severally be regarded as still subsisting, so far as their continuance for the purpose of upholding any right, title or interest, power, privilege, or immunity
ever exercised or enjoyed by any of Lheni, way be necessary

for the protection of their respective creditors or mortgagees,
or any of them; the separate exercise of their respective powers,
and the separate enjoyment of their separate privileges and
immunities being suspended until the protection of such creditors or mortgagees shall require their resumption, when such
suspension shall cease, so far as, and for such time as, the
protection of such creditors or mortgagees may require."
"§ 11. Any corporation purchasing or leasing the property
of any company or companies, or into which any company or
companies are consolidated and merged under this act, shall
be, at the time of availing itself of or accepting the benefits of
this act, in the actual business of furnishing gas to consumers;
and shall be subject to the following provisions:
"Such corporation shall not increase the price charged by
it for gag of the quality furnished to consumers during any part
of the year immediately preceding such purchase or lease or
such consolidation and merger.
"Such corporation shall furnish gas to consumers as good in
quality as it furnished previous to such purchase or lease or
such consolidation and merger."
The People's Gas Light and Coke Company under this act
became consolidated with some ten other gas companies, most
of which were organized under general laws passed in pursuance of the constitution of 1870. One of them, the Chicago
Gas Light and Coke Company, was incorporated by special act
of February 12, 1849, amended February 9, 1855, but this contained no restriction on the right of the-general assembly or the
city to regulate the price of gas from time to time.
The bill quoted from the eleventh section of the act of 1897
the clause in reference to the increase of price for gas of the
quality furnished consumers during any part of the year immediately preceding purchase or lease, or consolidation and
merger, and alleged the fact to be that during the year immediately preceding the acquisition by complainant of the various
other gas companies, complainant charged the net rate or price
of one dollar per thousand cubic feet, and since the acquisition

of the plants and property of those corporations that complainant had uniformly charged the same net rate or price for
gas ,sold by it in the city, which gas was better in quality and
of higher candle power than the gas theretofoi'e sold by the
companies acquired; and complainant averred, as matter of
law, that the price or rate thus fixed was a fixing and regulating
by the State of the price or rate to be charged by complainant
for gas supplied subsequent to the acquisition of said other
companies.
The bill also set forth an agreement made between the city
and the People's Gas Light and Coke Company, July 20, 1899,
which recited that agreements had theretofore subsisted between the city' and the People's Company, and between the
city and certain other gas companies, which companies subsequently became merged into the People's Company, and provided for a continuance of the lighting of the streets on the
same terms as it had been done, and for the payment by the
People's Company to the city of a certain percentage of the
gross receipts of the People's Company from the sales of gas
during 1899, including therein the receipts from the operation
of the properties of each of the gas companies consolidated
with the People's Company, and for the payment by the cityof amounts due or to become due to the People's Company or
confession of judgment for amounts remaining unpaid; and
the bill further set forth certain orders of the city between
August 5, 1897, and March 11, 1901, for the laying of pipes and
mains by the People's Company in the streets and avenues of
the city. Certain mortgages were likewise referred to and it
was alleged that bonds thereunder had been sold to parties
who purchased the same in the belief that the city was prohibited by its charter from compelling the People's Company
to furnish gas at a less rate than three dollars per thousand
cubic feet.
The bill also averred that the People's Company, prior to the
consolidation, distributed gas chiefly in the west division of the
city, although its pipes and mains extended into the -south

Opinion of the Court.

division, and that the other companies, or nearly all of them,
severally had plants and were engaged in manufacturing and
distributing gas in various other sections of the city.
On March 5, 1900, the city council passed an ordinance
which provided "that no corporation, company or companies,
firm or persons manufacturing, selling, supplying or distributing gas in the city of Chicago for illuminaling or for fuel purposes shall charge, exact, demand or cot ct from any consumer thereof more than the sum of seventy-five (75) cents
per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of gas consumed or used."
The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was invoked' on the
-ground of impairment or deprivation bk the ordinance of coq2
tract rights of complainant acquired by its charter, and the
bill prayed, among,other things, "that it may be adjudged. and
decreed that by said charter of the People's Gas Light and Coke
Company, the people of the State of Illinois agreed with the
People's Gas oLight and Coke Company, that the common
council of the city of Chicago should never be authorized to
compel the People's Gas-Light and Coke Company to furnish
gas ati a less rate than $3 per Thousand cubic feet, and that
such contract is , valuable property right of the said People's
Gas Light and Coke Company."
The Circuit Court declined to -specifically dispose of complainant's contention that by the act of February 7, 1865, the
State had contracted that the city should never require the
company to furnish gas at a less rate than three dollars per
thousand feet, because it held that the limitation or exemption,
even if conceiled, did not apply to the territory and rights acquired by the merger, and that the bill did not seek divisional
relief, and was not framed in that aspect; while most of the
consolidated companies were organized under the general incorporation law passed in pursuanceof the constitution of 1870,
and the right to fix reasonable rates was reserved, the works
not having been installed under any explicit contract to the
contrary, if such could have been entered into.
As to the clause-of the eleventh section of the act of June 5,

OCTOBER 'TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

194 U. S.

1897, providing: "Such corporation shall not increase the price
charged by it for gas of the quality furnished to consumers
during any part of the year immediately preceding such purchase or lease, or such consolidation and merger," the Circuit
Court ruled that this did not fix a rate unalterable by either
party, but a rate beyond which the consolidated companies
could not go.
The Circuit Court further held that the contention that the
State's power to regulate rates had not been delegated to the
city was not a Federal question, and that as the ground of impairment or deprivation of contract rights acquired by the
charter failed under the bill as framed, the court could not go
further and decide that question in this case; while the decree, as it stands, amended by consent, in terms reserved the
question to be raised in some other appropriate suit in a proper
court.
In these circumstances we are constrained to decline the consideration of that question so far as it relates to the contention
that power to regulate was conferred by the general law of
Illinois of 1871-2 providing for the incorporation of cities and
villages under which the city of Chicago as now constituted
was incorporated.
But the decree dismissed the bill "as to the alleged contract
rights of complainant," and in so doing the Circuit Court dealt
with the alleged fixing of rates by the act of 1897 as well as
with the alleged contract of 1865 that the city should not be
authorized to fix a rate of less than three dollars, for although,
as we have said, it was the impairment or deprivation of the
latter which was made the ground of Federal jurisdiction, it
was in effect as asserted to have been modified by the act of
1897. We agree with the Circuit Court that the clause of
section eleven of the act of 1897, that "such corporation shall
not increase the price charged by it for gas of the quality furnished to consumers during any part of the year immediately
preceding such purchase or lease or such consolidation or merger," read. according to the plain and ordinary signification of

Opinion of the Court.

the words, it being a general law applicable to eyery gas company and to every city in the State, was not intended to fix
and did not fix a rate unalterable by either party, but simply
a rate above which consolidated companies could not go. This
disposes of it as an independent ground of relief, and leaves
to be considered the provision of the amended charter of 1865,
that "ten years after the passage of this act the common
council of the city of Chicago may, by resolution or ordinance,
-egulate the prices charged by said company for gas; but said
common council of the city of Chicago shall, in no case, be
authorized to compel the said company to furnish gas at a less
rate than three dollars per thousand feet," as affected by the
act of 1897. That is to say, was the city cut off from reducing
the price below one dollar, conceding the power of the State
to do so?
It is contended, on the one hand, that the first part of this
provision granted the city the general power to regulate the
price after ten years, and that the latter part then ceased to
operate as a restriction. And, on the other hand, that the
whole'clause constituted a contract that the general assembly
would hot thereafter awthorize the city to fix the rate at less
than three dollars. But it is expressly conceded that the
general assembly possessed the power to regulate the price of
gas and to prescribe reasonable rates, and that, as complainant
availed itself of the act of 1897, and thereby, acquired the
plants of other gas companies, it can now only charge the rate
it had been charging the year immediately preceding the acquisition of those properties, namely, one dollar per thousand
cubic feet.
Assuming, but without intimating any opinion to that effect,
that by the amended charter of 1865 the State contracted with
the People's Gas Light and Coke Company that the city should
not thereafter be empowered to reduce the price of gas below
three dollars per thousand feet, the preliminary inquiry is
whether by the consolidation that contract was extended to the
plants of and territory occupied by the companies absorbed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

194 U. S.

The Circuit Court held that it was not so extended, and that
as the. bill sought relief in respect of the entire plants and
territory, the entire system as consolidated, it could not be
maintained because there was no such contract which the
ordinance impaired or destroyed.
It is said that partial relief might have been accorded unless
by the consolidation the alleged exemption 'Was lost, but the
bill was not framed in the alternative, and the ordinance itself
did. not contemplate a divided operation, although if the exemption existed as to part of the system the ordinance would
not necessarily be wholly void but might be held inoperative
pro. tanto notwithstanding serious difficulties in so applying it.
See Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company v. Virginia, 94
U. S. 718, and cases cited.
* Was the alleged exemption extended by the act of 1897,
when the other companies were. acquired?
Prior to that time the operations of the People's Company
were practically confined to the west division of the city, and
although it was empowered to lay pipes in any of the streets,
or avenues, this was only N.ith the city's consent. The city
in 1858 0uthorized the company to do this, but-this ws 'subject at all times" to the city's resolutions and ordinances.
It is true that after the acquisition of the other companies
the city compromised with the People's Company in respect
of claims for gas furnished, and also ordered the company to
lay mains in streets which formerly did not have them, but
this action was rot equivalent to consent to the extension of
the alleged restriction on rates to territory acquired under the
merger, with the accomplishment of which the city had nothing to do.
-The act of 1897 provided that the consolidated corporation
should be subject to the legal obligations of the companies
taken over, and most of thes were not exempt from the right
of regulatio and were obliged to submit to its exercise.
By the state constitution the general assembly was forbidden
to make "any irreyocable grant of special privileges or im-

munities," and the general rule is that a special statutory
exemption, such as- immunity from taxation, from the right
to determine rates of fare, or to control tolls, and the like,
does not pass to a new corporation succeeding others by consolidation or purchase, in the absence of express direction to
that effect in the statute. St. Louis & San FranciscoRailway
v. Gill, 156 U. S. 649; Norfolk & Western Railroad Company
v. Pendlelon, 156 U. S.667; Covington &c. Turnpike Company
v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578; Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway
Company v. Gardner, 177 U. S.332; Georgia Railroad & Banking Compaiq/ v. Smith, 128 U. S. 174. And the same rule is
applicable where the constituent comptinies are merely owned
and operated by one of them as authorized by the legislature.
An exemption held by the latter would not pass to the others
unless so provided., -So that' the act of 1897 cannot be construed as extending any prior immunity the acquiring company
possessed over the whole system of all the companies consolidated.
And if not, and the Circuit Court was right, as we think it
was, in holding that under the present bill complainant's
alleged exenption could not be enforced as to so much of the
system as originally belonged to it, then the court was justified
in d6eclining to discuss, w ther by the consolidation te alleged
exemption was lost altogether.
In short, agreeing with the Circuit Court, we are of opinion
that-the asserted immunity, (conceding it arguendo,) did not
extend to so much of the system as passed to the consolidated
company from companies not possessing such immunity in
their own right; that under this bill relief could not be accorded
in respect of part of the sytsem; that no contract that the price
of gas should not be reduced below one dollar per thousand
feet was created, nor was the alleged original exemption merely
modified and extended; and that the decree dismissing the bill

because there were no such contract rights as alleged impaired
or destroyed by the ordinance was right.
Decree affirmed.
