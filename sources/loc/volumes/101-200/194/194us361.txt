We have not considered whether the averments distinctively
made of the plaintiffs' title were sufficient to vest jurisdiction
in the Circuit Court, for that question was settled against the
plaintiffs by the decision in Filhiol v. Maurice, supra.
As the plaintiffs' statement of their right to the possession
of this land disclosed no case within the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court, that jurisdiction was not established by allegations as to the defence which the defendant might make or the
circumstances under which he took possession.

FISCHER v. ST. LOUIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 204. Argued April 12, 1904.-Decided May 16, 1904.

It is within the power of a municipality when authorized by the law of the
State, to make ,a general police regulation subject to exceptions, and to
delegate the discretion of granting the exceptions to a municipal board
or officer and the fact that some may be favored and some not, does not,
if the ordinance is otherwise constitutional, deny those who are not
favored the equal protection of the law.
The ordinance of the city of St. Louis, prohibiting the erection of any dairy

a police regulation, and is not unconstitutional as depriving one violating the ordinance of his property without due process of law, or denying
him the equal protection of the laws.
Whether such an ordinance is violated is not a Federal question, and this
court is bound by the decision of the state court in that respect.

THis proceeding was originally instituted by a criminal
complaint filed by the city of St. Louis against Fischer in the
Police Court for a violation of an ordinance of the city in
erecting, building and establishing on certain premises occupied byFischer, at Nos. 7208 and 7210 North Broadway, a
dairy and cow stable without first having obtained permission
so to do from the municipal assembly by proper ordinance,
and for maintaining such dairy and cow stable without permission of such assembly.
Motion was made to quash the complaint upon the ground,
amongst others, that section 5 of the ordinance under which
the conviction was held was in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
The case was submitted to the court upon the following
agreed statement of the facts:
"The plaintiff, the City of St. Louis, is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Missouri, and defendant is and was on the sixteenth day of
November, 1898, the occupant of certain premises known as
7208 and 7210 North Broadway, in the city of St. Louis, State
of Missouri, upon which premises, at said time, stood a dwelling house and frame stable, which had been erected and built
prior to the occupancy of said premises by defendant.
"At the time of the approval of ordinance No. 18,407, of
said city and State, said premises, buildings, and stable were
occupied and in use by a certain party other than this defendant, for the purpose of operating a dairy and maintaining a
cow stable, and this defendant was, at the same time, operating
a dairy and maintaining a cow stable on premises known as
No. 6305 Bulwer avenue, said city and State. Some time in
the month of March, 1898, the said premises at Nos. 7208 and

7210 North Broadway were abandoned as a dairy and cow
stable, and the dwelling house thereon was occupied by a
private family for residence purposes only, and no dairy or cow
stable was maintained on said premises from March, 1898,
until some time in September, 1898. In September, 1898,
defendant moved his cows, about thirty in number, from
-premises No. 6305 Bulwer avenue, said city, on to premises
Nos. 7208 and 7210 North Broadway, said city, placed them in
an old stable, and did proceed to conduct upon said premises
a dairy establishment and produce from said cows milk, and
sell the same to his customers for profit, and was doing so on
the said sixteenth day of November, 1898, without having
first obtained permission so to do from the municipal assembly
by proper ordinance, as provided by section 5 of ordinance
No. 18,407 of the city of St. Louis, approved April 6, 1896,"
a copy of which section is given in the margin.'
Upon this state of facts defendant was convicted and fined.
An appeal was granted to the St. Louis Court of Criminal
Correction, which affirmed the judgment. An appeal was then
taken to the Supremne Court of the State, where the judgment
was again affirmed. 167 Missouri, 654.

An ordinance which denies to a person the right to engage

An ordinance which treats a lawful business and occupation,

the person or persons carrying on such business the equal protection of the law and tends to create a monopoly, and is void
as conflicting with the Fourteenth Amendment. The Stockton

Under the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of
Missouri the scope, purpose and effect of this ordinance is to
compel the dairymen of St. Louis to move their business :outside the limits of the city whenever by circumstances they are
compelled to leave the premises upon which their dairies and
cow stables were in operation at the time the ordinance went
into effect. Such an ordinance tends to' destroy a lawful
occupation -and business and conflicts with the Fourteenth
Amendment. 'Cases cited supra.

That permission of the municipal assembly must be obtained

The charter provisions confer on the city express power to
prohibit altogether the erection or mainteiance of cow stables
and dairies as well as to remove and regulate the same, Under
these provisions it is competent to impose, instead of absolute
prohibition, the lesser restriction, upon) all persois desiring to
erect or maintain a dairy, of first obtaining p(rmission so to
do from the municipal assembly and maiyor by ordinance.
The maintenance of dairies and cow stables within the city
limits is not an absolute right, hut a privilege, and whether
under the individual circumstances of each ease the operation
of a dairy in the particular locality miay be advantageous or
injurious to the public is a question tlie determination of which
is properly left to the discretion of the municipal assembly,
and the ordinance is not for that reason void as conferring an
arbitrary and unregulated power. Cases supra, and Commonwealth v. Parks, 155 Massachusetts, 531; Quincy v. Kennard, 151 Massachusetts, 563; In re Flahcrty, 105 California,

Where the determination of the question whether the pursuit of a certain occupation, which may or may not be a nuisance according to conditions and circumstances, is left to the
discretion of the municipal assembly, the presumption is indulged by the courts that such body will make the proper
investigation and act impartially, not that it will favor one
and discriminate against another, or exercise its powers for
purposes of profit or oppression. Cases supra, and Soon hing

The possibility of the abuse of legislative power does not
disprove its existence. That possibility exists even in reference to powers that are conceded to exist. Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678, 686; Williams v. Mississippi, 170 U. S.

As it does not appear upon the face of the or(inance, or from
any facts in evidence or of 'Which the court must take judicial
cognizance, that it infringes' rights secured by the fundamental
law, or that there is any unjust discrimination, the legislative
determination of the questions of public policy requiring its
enactment is conclusive upon this court and forms no subject

MR. JUSTICE BROWN, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.'
The authority of the city of St. Louis to adopt the ordinance
in question is found in the Revised Statutes of the State, (1899,
pp. 2486 and 2488,) which declares: "The mayor and assembly
shall have power, within the city, by ordinance not inconsistent
with the Constitution, or any law of this State, or of this
charter, . . . to . . . prohibit the erection of
cow stables and dairies . . . within prescribed limits, and
to remove and regulate the same."
"Finally, to pass all shuch ordinances, not inconsistent with
the provisions of this charter or of the laws of the State, as may
be expedient in maintaining the peace, good government,
health and welfare of the city, its trade, commerce afid manufactures, and to enforce the same by fines and penalties not
exceeding five hundred dollars and by forfeitures not exceeding one thousand dollars."
The authority of the municipality of St. Louis, Under this
charter, to adopt the ordinance in question was settled by the
decision of the Supreme Court, and is not open to attack here.
Considerable stress is laid upon the fact that at the time the
ordinance was adopted, (April 6, 1896,) the dairy; and cow
stable had already been erected and at that time was occupied
and in use for that purpose, though such use was subsequently
abandoned and the premises used as a private residence for a

short time, when defendant moved his cattle there and established anew the dairy and cow stable which had theretofore
been used. The Supreme Court, however, found that defendant was guilty of maintaining a dairy and cow stable within
the meaning of the ordinance without permission of the municipal assembly, and as this construction of the ordinance
involves no Federal question, we are relieved from the necessity of considering it.
Defendant's objection to the ordinance, that it is made to
apply to the whole city when authority was only given by the
charter to prohibit the erection of cow stables and dairies
"within prescribed limits," is equally without foundation. If
it were possible to prescribe limits for the operation of the
ordinance it was held by the Supreme Court to be equally
possible to declare that those limits should be coincident with
the limits of the city. 'This is also a non-Federal question.
Defendant's main contention, however, is that, by vesting
in the municipal assembly the power to permit the erection of
dairy and cow stables to certain persons, a discrimination is
thus declared in favor of such persons and against all other
persons, and the equal protection of the laws denied to all the
disfavored class. The power of the legislature to authorize its
municipalities to regulate and suppress all such places or occupations as in its judgment are likely to be injurious to the
health of its inhabitants or to disturb people living in the
immediate neighborhood by loud noises or offensive odors, is
so clearly within the poliee power as to be no longer open to
question. The keeping of swine and cattle within the city or
designated limits of the city has been declared in a number of
cases to be within the police power. The keeping of cow
stables and daMies is riot only likely to be offensive to neighbors, but it is too often made an excuse for the supply of impure milk from cows which are fed upon unhealthful food,
such as the refuse from distilleries, etc. In re Linehan, 72
California, 114; Quincy v. Kennard, 151 Massachusetts, 563;
Love v. Judge, 128 Michigan, 545.

FISCHER v. ST. LOUIS.
194 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

We do not regard the fact that permission to keep cattle
may be granted by the municipal assembly as impairing in any
degree the validity of the ordinance, or as denying to the disfavored dairy keepers the equal protection of the laws. Such
discrimination might well be made where one person desired
to keep tw5 cows and another fifty; where one desired to establish a stable in the heart of the city and another in the
suburbs; or, where one was known to keep his stable in a filthy
condition and another had established a reputation for good
order and cleanliness. Such distinctions are constantly made
the basis for licensing one person to sell intoxicating liquors
and denying it to others. The question in each case is whether
the establishing of a dairy and cow stable is likely, in the hands
of the applicant, to be a nuisance or not to the neighborhood,
and to imperil or conduce to the health of its customers. As
the dispensing power must be vested in some one, it is not easy
to see why it may not properly be delegated to the municipal
assembly which enacted the ordinance. Of course, cases may
be imagined where the power to issue permits may be abused
and the permission accorded to social or political favorites and
denied to others, who for reasons totally disconnected with the
merits of the case are distasteful to the licensing, power. No
such complaint, however, is made to the practical application
of the law in this case, and we are led to infer that none such
exists. We have no criticism to make of the principle of
granting a license to one and denying it to another, and are
bound to assume that the discrimination is made in the interest
of the public, and upon conditions applying to the health and
comfort of the neighborhood. Crowley v. Christensen, 137
U. S. 86; Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43; Soon Hing v.
Crowley, 113 U. S. 703, 710.

The only alternative to the allowance of such exceptions
would be to make the application of the ordinance universal.
This would operate with great hardship upon persons who
desire to establish dairies and cow stables in the oulskirts of
the city, as well as inconvenience to the inhabitants, who to

that extent would be limited in their supply of milk. It would
be ,exceedingly difficult to make exceptions in the ordinance
itself without doing injustice in individual cases, and we see
no difficulty in vesting in some body of men, presumed to be
acquainted with the business and its conditions, the pQwer to
grant permits in special cases. It has been held in some of
the state courts to be contrary to the spirit of American institutions to vest this dispensing power in the hands of a single
individual, Chicago v. Trotter, 136 Illinois, 430; Matter of
Frazee, 63 Michigan, 396; State v. Fiske, 9 R. I. 94; Baltimore
v. Radecke, 49 Maryland, 217; Sioux Falls v. Kirby, 6 S. Dak.
62, and in others that such authority cannot be delegated to
the adjoinirig lot owners. St. Louis v. Russell, 116 Missouri,
248; Ex parte Sing Lee, 96 California, 354. But the authority
to delegate that discretion to a board appointed for that purpose is sustained by the great weight of authority, Quincy v.
Kennard, 151 Massachusetts, 563; Commonwealth v. Davis, 162
Massachusetts, 510, and by this court the delegation of such
power, even to a single individual, was sustained in Wilson v.
Eureka City, 173 U. S. 32, and Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S.
183.
Whether the defendant be in a position to avail himself of
the alleged invalidity of the ordinance without averring that
he applied for and had been refused a permit to establish the
dairy and cow stable in question, as was intimated in the latter
case, is not necessary to a decision here, and we express no
opinion upon the point.
It is sufficient for us to hold, as we do, that the ordinance in
question does not deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law, nor deny to him the equal protection
of the laws.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is, therefore,
Affirmed
