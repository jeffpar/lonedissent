246.

Argued April 22, 25, 1904.-Decided May 31, 1904.

Corporations having consolidated under a state statute providing that on
the recording of the agreement the separate existence of the constituent
corporations should cease and become a single corporation subject to the
provisions of that law, and other laws relating to such a corporation, and
should be vested with all the property, business, credits, assets and
effects of the constituent companies, and one of the corporations claimed
to possess an exclusive franchise to furnish water to a city under which
the city could not for a period erect its own works, and the constitution
and laws of the State at the time of the consolidation, but passed after
the franchise was granted, prohibited the. granting of such exclusive
privileges.
Held that on the consolidation the orginial corporations disappeared and
the franchises of the consolidated corporation were left to be determined
by the general law as it existed at the time of the consolidation and the
corporation did not succeed to the right of the original company to exclude the city from erecting its own plant.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUrIcn

194 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is it suit in equity brought by the appellants to enjoin
the city of Covington frbm setting up an electric plant to
furnish light, heat, and power to the city and its citizens.
The ground of the suit is that the intended action of the city
will impair the obligations of a contract with the Suburban
Electric Company, contrary to article 1, section 10, of the
Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff Shaw is
trustee in' bankruptcy of the Electric Company. The contract set up consists of a clause in a charter granted by the
legislature of Kentucky on April 22, 1882, to the Covington
Electric Light Company. By § 5 the business of the company
is limited to furnishing the City of Covington, its inhabitants,
and others near the city, with light, motive power, and heat,
and the company is given "the exclusive privilege of conducting the business above described within and adjacent to said
city for the term of twenty-five years, but a non-user of the
privilege of this act of incorporation for five years shall work
a forfeiture." One of the contentions of the defendants is
that this privilege was lost by non-user. But as our judgment proceeds upon other grounds we say nothing about that,
but assume, for the purposes of decision, that the privilege
was acquired, subject to the general reservation by the State
of the power to repeal. Hamilton Gas Light & Coke Co. v.
Hamilton, 146 U. S. 258; Citizens' Savings Bank v. Owensboro,
173 U. S. 636.
The Circuit Court dismissed the bill on the grounds that this
privilege was repealed from and after September 28, 1897, by
what is now § 573 of the Kentucky statutes (1894), or would
have been repealed if not previously lost by the consolidation
of the Covington Electric Light Company with other companies on April 11, 1894, as the court thought that it had been.
The plaintiffs appealed to this court. They are met at the
outset by the dilemma, thot either the action of the municipality is sanctioned by the State, in which case the State must

SIAW ?'. CITY OF COVINGTON.

Opinion of the Court.

be taken to have exercised its reserved right to repeal its grant
to that extent, or the action of the municipality isriot so
sanctioned, in which case it cannot be a law impairing the
obligation of contracts within the clause of the Constitution,
and the plaintiffs are out of court. Hamilton Gas Light &
Coke Co. v. Hamilton, 146 U. S. 258; Wisconsin & Michigan
Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191 U. S. 379, 385. See Joplin v. Southwest
Missouri Light Co., 191 U. S. 150, 155, 156. But in view of
City Railway Co. v. Citizens' Street R. R, Co., 166 U. S. 557,
we do not stop to consider this point further, as the result
will be the same whatever the ground.
As we have implied, the original grantee of the exclusive
privilege consolidated with other companies on April 11, 1894.
This was done under what are now §§ 555 and 556 of the
Kentucky statutes. By the latter section, when the agreement of consolidation is recorded, etc., "the separate existence
of the constituent corporations shall cease, and the consolidated corporations shall become a single corporation in ac-.
cordance with the said agreement, and subject to all the
provisions of this chapter, and other laws relating to it, and
shall be vested with 1I the property, business, credits, assets
and effects of the constituent corporations without deed or
tra_. r, and shall be bound for all their contracts and liabilities." The ol companies disappear and the new company
must claim whatever rights it gets-from the law which calls
it into being. It is absolutely subject to the constitution
and laws then in force. Therefore it can claim the franchises and privileges of its constituent companies by succession, only under the words "property," or "assets ind effects,"
if at all. These words certairtly are not happily chosen to
express the transfer of a franchise, still less to express lw continuance of a right not to be competed with, granted by the
legislature to a named corporation, after that corporal ion stiall
have ceased to exist. The natural meaning of the words
would be that the ordinary property of the consolidating corporations, the property such as any one might own without

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Couit.

194 U. S.

special franchise and might transfer by deed, shall belong to
the new company without deed, but the franchises of the new
company would seem to be left to be determined by the general law. The new corporation is to be "subject to all the
provisions of this chapter, and other laws relating to it." This
interpretation is strengthened by the consideration that other
sections show that the legislature had franchises and privileges before its mind, And evidently did not fail to mention
them from forgetfulness. In the cases cited by the appellants
the privileges and franchises of the constituent companies
were continued in the new company by explicit and careful
words. Philadelphia, Wilmington &c. R. R. v. Maryland,
10 How. 376; New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Cb., 115
U. S. 650.
The impression that the plaintiffs did not inherit a right
to exclude the city of Covington from setting up a plant before
1907 as the result of the consolidation is confirmed still further
when we consider the state of the law at the time. By § 191
of the constitution of 1891 "all existing charters or grants of
special or exclusive privileges, under which a bona fide organization shall not have taken place,

shall thereafter

.

be void and of no effect." Again, by § 164, no city can grant
any franchise or privilege, or make any contract in refrtwence
thereto, for a term exceeding twenty years, and the grantee
is to be the highest and best bidder at a .public offer. We
assume that the Covington Electric Light Company escaped
these sections, but they show the policy of the State to have
been against such a right as it claimed. It is doubtful, at
least, whether the legislature could have granted it in 1894;
and this is a reason the more for construing the strict language of the consolidation sections to have meant no more
than they said. We may add to the foregoing, as indicative
of the general jealousy of exclusive rights, § 3 of the bill of
rights: "No grant of exclusive

.

.

.

privileges shall be

made to any man or set of men except in consideration of
public services." It was uncertain, until decided, whether

SHAW v. CITY OF COVINGTON.

Opinion of the Court.

under this section such an exclusive fight as that of the Coyington Electric Light Company could be granted, and the
prevailing local opinion was that such grants were forbidden.
Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens' Gas Co., 11,5 U. S. 683; S. C., 81
Kentucky, 263. This, again, goes to show that the meagre
words used in describing the rights of the new couipany were
chosen with intelligent care. Everything in the constitution
looked to the abolition and refusal of special privileges and to
putting all corporations on an equal footing. It was natural,
therefore, when old corporations consolidated, that the law
should treat the new corporation which it then called into
being as it would have treated another corporation coming
into being at the same time, but starting fresh, instead of
being a consolidation of the old. We refer again to the words,
"subject to all the provisions of this chapter, and other laws
relating to it," in § 556.
Finally, we add to the language of the constitution the
section of the statutes which the Circuit Court adjudged to
have repealed the grant of a monopoly to the original company.
By § 573 the provisions of all charters "which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this chapter concerning similar corporations, to the extent of such conflict, and all powers, privileges or immunities of any such corporation Which could not
be obtained under the provisions of this chapter, shall stand
repealed on September 28, 1897," and the exercise of the repealed powers is made a crime. After September 28, 1897,
the provisions of the chapter are to apply to all corporations
if they would be applicable to such corporations if organized
.under that chapter. There was nice discussion, and it is a
fair question whether this section did not repeal the exclusive
privilege given to the Covington Company in 1897, if that
privilege survived the consolidation. But we refer to it only
as an aid in coristruing § 556. It is another evidence of the
wish and intent of the legislature to bring all corporations to
a level when it could.
Practically it was admitted that the new corporation formed

194 i. S.

by consolidation in 1894, was subject to the statutes and
constitution then in force. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Ry.
Co. v. Adams, 180 U. S. 1. To dispute the proposition would
be to discredit the whole of the appellants' case. But that
being so, ve thindk that we have shown that the policy of the
law at the time of the passage of the consolidation statute, Ky.
Stats. § 556, act of April 5, 1893, was entirely opposed to the
continuance of such a special right as is claimed, and therefore
have given a sufficient reason for construing the words as
meaning what they seem on their face 'to mean and no more.
It may be doubted whether the legislature could have kept
the Covington Light Company monopoly alive in the hands
of a new and'distinct corporation. Keokuk & Western R. R.
v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 301. But at all events we are satisfied
that it did not try to do so. See Yazoo & Mississippi Valley
Ry. Co. v. Adams,. 180 U. S. 1.
In the very able argument for the appellants an attempt was
made to detach the exclusive privilege, given by § 5 of the
Covington Electric Light Company's charter, from "conducting the business," to which it was attached by that section,
and to transfer it to the "privilege," granted by § 6, "subject
to the regulations of the city authorities, to lay its pipes and
mains, and erecting its poles, posts and wires through and
along any street," etc. The latter, it is said, is an easement,
the exclusive character is part of -it, and it all goes, like any
other property, to the successors of the Covington Company.
We cannot be so ingenious. However the plaintiffs may stand
as to using the streets, the Covington Company's monopoly
in business was distinct from its rights in the streets. When
the Covington Company died its monopoly came to an end.
Decree affirmed.
