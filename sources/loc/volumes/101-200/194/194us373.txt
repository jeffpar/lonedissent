UNITED STATES ex rel. HOLZENDORF v. HAY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 210. Argued April 12,13, 1904.-Decided May 16, 1904.

The "matter in dispute," as respects a money demand, as employed in the
statutes regulating appeals from the courts of the District of Columbia,
has relation to justiciable demands and must be money or some right, the
value of which can be ascertained in money, and which appears by the
record to be of the requisite pecuniary 'value.
Where the averments in a petition that a mandamus be issued directing the
Secretary of State to assert for the petitioner a claim against a foreign
government do not statue a cause of action under the principles of law
of false imprisonment in this country, and do not show that the alleged
wrong was actionable in such foreign country, the right to have the
claim asserted is purely conjectural, and not susceptible of pecuniary
estimate, and.cannot be said to have the value necessary to give this court
jurisdiction, and the writ must be dismissed.
THE

relator, plaintiff in error, filed his petition in the Su-
