Statement of the Case.

taken into custody, until he should answer the question. He
petitioned the Circuit Court for writ of habeas corpus, and from
the judgment remanding him to custody prosecuted an appeal
to this court. It was held that he was compellable to answer.
In the case at bar, as we have already said, plaintiff in error
did not claim the protection afforded him by the bankrupt
act. He made no objection to the use of the testimony which
he gave before the referee, nor does he now urge its use as
error. He broadly claimed and now claims exemption from
prosecution. For the reasons we have given the claim is
untenable.
Judgment affirmed.

TERRE HAUTE AND INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD COMPANY v. INDIANA ex rel. KETCHAM.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 264.
Argued April 29, May 2,1904.-Decided May 31, 1904.
Where the state court has sustained a result which cannot be reached except
on what this court deems a wrong construction of the charter without
relying on unconstitutional legislation this court cannot decline jurisdiction on writ of error because the state court apparently relied more on
the unfenable construction than on the unconstitutional statute.
A provision in a charter of a railroad company that the legislature may
so regulate tolls that not more than a certain percentage be divided as
profits to the stockholders and the surplus shall be paid over to the
state treasurer for the use of schools, held, in this case to be permissive
and not mandatory and that until the State acted or made a demand
the railroad company could act as it saw fit as to its entire earnings.
When, therefore, the company surrendered its original charter and accepted
a new one without any such provision and there had up to that time been
no attempt on the part of the State to regulate tolls nor any demand made
for surplus earnings the company was free from liability under the original
charter, and subsequent legislation attempting to amend its charter or
the general railroad law would not affect its rights.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

The State, having accepted an unconditional surrender of
the company's original charter, could not thereafter impose an
obligation upon the company by virtue of power contained
in the surrendered charter. The surrender was equivalent
to the repeal of the charter with the consent of the company.

ary 18 declared the contract of surrender made twenty-four
years before to be inoperative. The act of February 24 undertook to amend the charter, which never was subject to amendment, and which, moreover, had been surrendered twentyfour years before, by imposing new and different obligations
and declaring that the liability of the company should "be
the same as though this amendment had been originally a
part of the charter of said railroad and as though a suit to
enforce such accounting had been prosecuted prior to the
acceptance by said railroad company of the general railroad
law of the State." The act of March 4 appropriated the company's private property to the use of the State and directed
the Attorney General to sue for its rerovery.
The company never was liable to account to the State for
surplus earnings, in the absence of legislation regulating its
tolls. This was the thing adjudged by the Superior Court of
Marion County in 1876. The adjudication of a question of
law, such as the construction of a contract, is as binding as
the adjudication of an issue of fact. Tioga Railroad v. Blossburg &c. Railroad, 20 Wall. 137; New Orleans v. Citizcns' Bank,

The judgmQnt does not depend in any respect upon the
denial of any right secured by the Constitution of the United
States, and no Federal question is involved. The jurisdiction
of this court in the present case depends upon whether in the
court below the defendant in error asserted the validity of the
legislation by the general assembly of the State of Indiana,
of 1897, and that the plaintiff denied such" -alidity on the
ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the
United States, and that the decision was in favor of its validity,
or whether any right claimed under the Constitution of the
United States, and specially set up and claimed by the plaintiff
in error, has been *denied. 1 Compiled Statutes, U. S. 1901,

A Federal question is not presented simply because the party
litigant asserts that the claim made against him by his adversary depends upon the assertion, or involves the denial,
of some right secured to him by the Constitution or laws of
the United States. The record must affirmatively show such
to be the fact. Crowell v. Randall, 10 Pet. 368.
The assignment of errors, asserting the existence and decision against the plaintiff in error, of a Federal question,
counts for nothing, unless from the record itself the facts
appear. Fowler v. Lamson, 164 U. S. 252; Clarke v. McDade,

Regulation of tolls by the legislature was not a condition
precedent to the obligation of plaintiff in error to pay its
surplus earnings to the Treasurer of State for the use of the
common schools. Section 23 of the act of 1847 limited the
amount that plaintiff in error should ever appropriate in
profits to its own use.
When these sums were realized, the surplus, if any, after
the payment of the expenses, and reserving such proportion
as might be necessary for future contingencies, was payable
to the Treasurer of State for the use of common schools, without reference to whether the State had taken action to .regulate the tolls and freights of the company.
The road held the profits in trust upon demand of the State,

Opinion of the Court.

Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578.
.MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit brought by the State of Indiana to, ascertain
and to recover from -the plaintiff in error the total net profits
made by the latter over fifteen per cent on the true cost of construction of its railroad, from the'time when the net earnings
equalled that cost with ten per cent on the same added. The
claim of the State was made under § 23 of the charter of the
railroad, approved January 26, 1847, and four acts of 1897
to be referred to. The complaint admits, and the answer sets
up, a surrender on January 17, 1873, of the charter of 1847, on(
which the supposed obligation, was based, and an acceptance
of the general railroad law by the company, and also a judgment for the company in March, 1876, on a former complaint
for the same cause. The answer also makes a general denial
and invokes the Fourteenth Amendment and other relevant
parts of the Constitution of the United States. The case was
referred to a master, who ruled that the former judgment was
not a bar, but ruled also that the company was not liable.
The superior court ruled the other way and gave judgment
against the company for $913,905.01. This judgment was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, and the case then
was brought here by writ of error.
By § 22 of the charter the railroad is given absolute discretion in the fixing of charges. Then, by § 23: "When the
aggregate amount of dividends declared shall -amount to the
full sum invested and ten per centum per annum thereon, the
tegislature may so regulate the tolls and freights that not more
than fifteen per centum per annum shall be divided on the
capital employed, and the surplus profits, if any, after paying
the expenses and receiving [reserving?] such proportion as may
be necessary for future contingencies, shall be paid over to the
treasurer of State, for the use of common schools, but the cor-

poration shall not be :compelled by law to reduce the tolls and
freights so that a dividend of fifteen per centum per annum
cannot be made; and it shall be the duty of the corporation to
furnish the legislature., if required, with a correct statement
of the amount of expenditures and the amount of profits after
deducting all expenses," etc. By §24: Semi-annual dividends
of so much of the profits as the corporation may deem expedient are to be made, and "the directors may retain such
proportion of the profits as a contingent fund to meet subsequent expenses as they shall deem proper." By § 35, repealed
in 1848, the corporation is to keep a fair record of the whole
expense of making and repairing its road, etc.', and also a fair
account of the tolls received, and the State is to have the right
to purchase the stock of the company after twenty-five -years
for a sum equal, with the tolls received, to the cost and expenses of the railroad with ten per cent.
The complaint relied also upon an amendment of section 23,.
on February 24, 1897, attempting to make the above mentioned surplus profits 4 debt and to make the company accountable from the beginning of such profits. The complaint
still further relied upon an act of January 27, 1897, requiring
the railroad to account; an act of March 4, 1897, appropriating
the net earnings of the company above fifteen per cent, etc.,
as above, to the use of common schools, and authorizing a
demand and a suit; and an amendment of the general railroad
law on February 18, 1897, after the surrender of this company's
charter, providing that all liabilities to the State, whether
inchoate or complete, under special charter, were and should
be reserved, notwithstanding the past or future acceptance of
the surrender of such special charters.
The Supreme Court, while agreeing that the right of the
State must depend on the original charter, did give force to
this later legislation, in terms, as providing a remedy, and, on
the construction which we are compelled to give to the charter,
did also give force in fact to the amendment to the provision
attempting retrospectively to save the charter obligations after

TERRE HAUTE &c. RAILROAD CO. v. INDIANA. 587
194 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

a surrender had been accepted. Therefore the question is
properly here whether these statutes impaired the rights of the
railroad under the Constitution of the United States. For in
order to determine whether the later legislation impairs those
rights, this court must decide for itself what those rights were.
If in the opinion of this court the State had lost all right to
demand any sum whatever under § 23 of the charter, legislation necessary to enforce such a demand is invalid and may
be pronounced so by this court, notwithstanding the fact that
the cause of action now is based upon the original act. We
shall recur to the question of our jurisdiction after discussing
the merits of the case, which we must do to make what little
we have to add plain.
The Supreme Court of the State seems, although it is not
clear, to have construed §23 as creating by itself alone a debt
to the State which accrued as fast as surplus profits were
realized, which, under that section, might have been required
to be paid over to the treasurer of State. It is pointed out
that in 1847 the State had no credit and was in need of roads
and schools, and that therefore it was natural to provide for
the handing over of any surplus after a liberal return to the
owners of the road. It is thought that the express grant of
an absolute right to fifteen per cent negatives the right to more,
that the provisions for an account in §§23 and 35 and the
mandatory language as to the surplus confirm this result, and
that it is unreasonable to suppose that the legislature, after indicating what by the agreement of the parties would be a fair
demand of the State, should leave the right of the Statp in abeyance until a future legislature should choose to act. In this
way the amendment of § 23 in 1897 is practically carried into
effect. While repudiated as legislation it is adopted by construction, and is found 'to express only the meaning of the
original act.
We are driven to a different construction of the charter,
notwithstanding the deference naturally felt for the decision
of a state court upon state laws. The language is plaits. The

194 U. S.

legislature "may so" regulate tolls "that" not more than
fifteen per cent shall be divided, "and" the surplus profit
shall a -)aid over. The word "may," it is agreed, is permissikye, -not mandatory. In the next place it is only upon its
regulation of tolls, so that not more than fifteen per cent shall
be divided, that dividends are confined to that sum. Otherwise the general power, given by § 24, to declare such dividends
as the company deems expedient, remains in force. Finally,
the payment over of the surplus profits above fifteen per cent
is not a separate, independent and absolute mandate, but is
connected with "so regulate tolls that" by "and."
Like the
cutting down of dividends, it is a result" of the regulation.
Again, the duty of the corporation to furnish the legislature
a statement of expenditures is only "if required." It might
be required in order to be certain whether it was advisable to
regulate tolls. Perhaps if the legislature had regulated them
it might be required in order to find out what was due. The
provision for a record and an account in the repealed § 35
seems to us to have little bearing. They were required there,
primarily at least, with reference to the possible purchase of
the-.stock by the State. We infer that the state courts considered the words "regulate tolls" to refer solely to fixing the
amount to be charged, and regarded the payment over of the
surplus as an independent mandate. It seems to us that the
words as here used meant more, and embraced not only fixing
the amount to be charged to the public, but an order for the
division of earnings between the railroad and the schools.
The provision as to the surplus over fifteen per cent is not
sufficiently accounted for if the regulation of tolls is intended
to make the profits as near fifteen per cent as may be.
Not only the absolute discretion as to dividends given by
§ 24, but the similar discretio given by.the same section as
to the proportion of profits to be retained, confirms the grammatical. construction of § 23. Circumstances might change,
and knowledge might change. It is agreed that they did
not know nruch about railroads in 1847. The corporation

TERRE HAUTE &c. RAILROAD CO. v. INI)IANI. 589

Opinion of the Court.

was allowed to make and to distribute or retain such earnings
as it could, subject to the power of the State in certain events
to require it to pay over extra profits, or to sell its stock. But
which, and whether the State would make either demand, was
left undecided, and until the State elected the whole earnings
of the company were its own.
It follows that when the company surrendered its charter
in 1873, there having been no attempt by the State to regulate
tolls before that time, the company was free from liability or
the possibility of demand. Therefore it is only by attempting,
as it did attempt in its complaint, to apply the subsequent
amendment of the general railroad law that the State can come
into court. That law, it will be remembered, purported retrospectively to save rights under surrendered charters. It does
not need argument to show that this amendment could not
affect the plaintiff.
The case then stands thus: The state court has sustained a
result which cannot be reached, except on what we deem a
wrong construction of the charter, without relying on unconstitutional legislation. It clearly (lid rely upon that legislation
to soine extent, but exactly ho-k far is left obscure.. We are of
.opinion. that we cannot decline jurisdiction of a case which
certainly never would have been brought but for the passage
of flagrantly unconstitutional laws, because the state court put
forward the untenable construction more than the unconstitutional statutes in its judgment. To hold otherwise would open
an easy method of avoiding tl{e jurisdiction of this court.
Louisville Gas Co. v. Citicn s' Gas Co., 115 U. S. 683, 697.
We may add that it is admitted that one of the acts of 1897"
was necessary to authorize a demand and so t6 create a cause
of action. It was for want of an authorized demand that the
former suit was held no bar. But in our opinion the State.
had no right in 1897 to make a demand.
Judgment reversed.
