SIMPSON v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE- COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 31.

Argued October 27, 30, 1905.-Decided November 27, 1905.

In construing a contract with the Commissary General for supplies to posts
in Cuba described at one place as "remote from the seacoast" and at
another as "in the interior of the island;" held, that the two phrases meant
the same thing and interpreted the word "interior,' and that the contemporaneois construction of the Commissary General in refusing to
take supplies for a post about eight miles from Havana and the camping
ground for that city, that the contract applied only to posts rem6te from,
the seacoast, was correct: Also held that the written contract could
not be extended to places not specified therein, by an iidefinite or'al
agreement.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. A. A. Hoehling, Jr., with whom Mr. John S,Blair was
on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradtand Mr. P. M. Ash/ord,
Special Assistant Attorney, submitted for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This case arises upon a contract between the Commissary
General of Subsistence and the claimant, by which it was agreed
that the claimant should "deliver, to the commissaries of the
United States troops stationed at such posts and camps as- are
situated in the interior of the island of Cuba at such prescribed
hours on such days as, under the direction of their commanding
officers they shall designate, such quantities of fresh beef
as from time to time
โข . . fit for immediate use . .
they may require." The contract was to "be in force from
the fifth day of January, 1899, to the thirtieth day of June, 1899,
inclusive, or such less time for any post as the Commissary

General of Subsistence, U. S. Army, may direct." The claims
made are two, one for a refusal to take beef needed for troops
at Los Quemados, during certain parts of the" contract time,
and another for a refusal to take it at Havana and Matanzas.
The Court of Claims found the facts and dismissed the petition.
The reasons for the judgment were not given, but manifestly
were that, on the facts stated, the claimant had no claim, as
matter of law.
The claim in respect of the ports of Havana and Matanzas
is based on a talk with the Commissary General before the contract was made, in which that officer stated that it was the
purpose and intent of the department to cover the entire beef
supply for the Island of Cuba by two contracts; one with
Swift & Co., for refrigerated beef, slaughtered in the United
States and delivered at points on the seacoast, the other with
the claimant, for fresh beef, and that when Swift & Co. could
not furnish beef the claimant's contract covered the entire
island, both interior and seacoast. It is enough to say that
the claim based on this conversation files in th face of the
contract, which confines the undertaking of the United States
to beef for camps in the interior. The conversation is inadmissible, and if admitted would not be definite enough to
change the plain meaning of the written words. Brawley v.
United States, 96 U. S.168, 173; Simpson v. United States, 172
U. S.372, 397.
The claim in respect of Los Quemados raises two questions,
or at least two were argued, one, whether the words "such
quantities

.

.

.

as from time to time they may require,"

means such quantities as the commissaries may make requisition for, or such quantities as they may need, the other,
whether the camp at Los Quemados was "situated in the interior of the island," within'the true intent of the contract.
Our opinion upon the lattei will dispose of the case.
Los Quemados was the camp of the main body of troops in
the vicinity of Havana, and about six or eight miles from that
city. It was about two miles and a half from the beach of

Marianao, and connected with both points by rail. There
was a refrigerator plant there which had been erected by
Swift & Co., so that if the claimant regarded his contract as
the supplement to that of Swift & Co., there was notice on the
face of the earth that this poirrt was supposed to be within
'their territory. The original advertisement for proposals, referred to by the claimant when he made his offer, spoke of
"posts remote from the seacoast," a later one, also referred
to, read "posts and camps in the interior of the island." Obviously the two phrases were used as meaning the same thing,
and they may be considered in interpreting the word" interior"
in the contract. Bradley v. Washington, Alexandria and Georgetown Steam Packet Co., 13 Pet. 89, 101; Stoops v. Smith, 100
Massachusetts, 63, 65, 66; Prouty v. Union Hardware Co., 176
Massachusetts, 155, 158; Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson,
18994900, App. Cas. 182; Bruce v. Moon, 57 So. Car. 60, 68,
69; 4 Wigmore, Evidence, ยง2465. When performance of the
contract began in January, 1899, beef was not ordered of the
claimant for this camp. On the twenty-sixth he protested,
but not on the ground that Los Quemados was situated in the
interior of the island. His complaint was th-at he was to
furnish all the fresh beef except that furnished under Swift
& Co.'s contract. The reply from the acting Commissary
General, and the local Chief Commissary, was that his contract embraced camps in the interior, "and not seacoast points,"
thus showing how the contract was construed at that time.
He does not appear to have suggested a different view, although he seems to have kept on trying to get what orders he
could. During January and February beef was purchased from
third parties. On February 21, he was notified that commissaries throughout the island had been instructed to call on him
to furnish fresh beef under his contract whenever Swift & Co.
could not do so under theirs, and he furnished beef for Los
Quemados for the first thirteen days of March and was paid
for it. But it will be observed that this action again was not
on the ground that Los Quemados was a camp in the interior.

Opinion of the Court.

While insufficient to modify the contract in the sense of the
claim first discussed, it was based on the willingness which
the claimant had shown to furnish beef to that greater extent.
Pursuant to the notice it would seem that he furnished beef
to various points upon the coast.
On March 13 the call upon the claimant was stopped and
he again protested. On May 4, the Secretary of War decided
that the camp at Quemados was an interior post, but called
the attention of the Commissary Department to the clause in
the contract providing that it should be in force from January.5 to June 30, 1899, or such less time for any post as the
Commissary of Subsistence might direct. Accordingly the
Commissary General notified the claimant that "the suspension
of the delivery of fresh beef un(ler your contract

.

.

.

is

hereby made to cover the life of the contract in so far as it
relates to the post of Queniados." The claimant, of course,
relies upon this construction of his contract so far as it favors

him, while he repudiates the attempt to terminate his rights
,under the last quoted clause. But this interpretation was after
the event ,and was not accepted or- acted upon otherwise than
to give the notice just mentioned. As we have shown, the
,contemporary construction by the men on the spot was different, and seems to have been accepted by the claimant. Taking the instrument in connection with the facts that for camping purposes Quernados was Havana, and that, as between the
parties, interior meant remote from the seacoast, we are of
opinion that the United States did not promise to take beef
from the claimant at that point.
Judgment affirmed.
