FOPPIANO v. SPEED.
SAME v. SAME.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE.
Nos. 67 and 68. Argued November 9, 1905.-Decided December 4, 1905.
Since the passage of the Wilson Act of August 8, 1890, 26 Stat. 313, there
is a distinction between the right to sell intoxicating liquors on vessels
engaged in interstate commerce and other businesses conducted on such
vessels.
Under the provisions of that act a State may, in the exercise of its police
powers, exact a license fee as a condition of the right to sell intoxicating
liquor over the bar on board of a steamboat while within the boundaries
of the State, notwithstanding such boat is navigating the Mississippi
River and is engaged in interstate commerce.
Such a license fee is not a tax on the boat, crew, passengers or liquor sold,
nor a fee for navigating the river, the imposition of which would be an
interference with the commerce clause of the Constitution, nor does it in
any way violate the freedom of the navigation of the Mississippi River as
guaranteed by treaties and statutes.
The fact that the boat is personal property owned by a corporation of
another State does not make it a part of the territory of that State, and
exempt those thereon from the police regulations of another State in
regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor while within the boundaries of
the latter State.

plaintiff in error was compelled to pay for a license to
sell liquors while on a ferryboat at the city of Memphis, in the
State of Tennessee, the ferryboat plying between ports in the
States of Arkansas and Tennessee. The license was demanded

by the clerk of the County Court of Shelby County, by virtue
of the following state statute:
"Liquor Dealers
"Persons selling beer or any quantities of liquor on steamboats, flatboats, or any other vessel, or water craft, or from
railroad cars, shall pay a tax, each, in lieu of all other taxes,
to be paid in any county they may elect, per annum, two
hundred dollars."
. He denied his liability to pay because, as he averred, he was
engaged in interstate commerce, and was not subject to be
taxed by the State in such case. The taxing officers insisting,
he paid the license for the past years 1901, 1902, 1903, and also
for the then coming year of 1904, under protest, and, to avoid
the taking of his property under a distress warrant, and he
then commenced these actions to recover the money so paid.
They both involve the same question, one action being brought
to recover for the back taxes paid and the other for the taxes
paid for the future, from January 1, 1904. Judgment went
against -him in the trial court, which was affirmed in the Supreme Court of the State. 82 S.W. Rep. 222. The plaintiff
brings the cases here by writs of error.
The record shows that Speed, the defendant in error, being
cierk of Shelby County, Tennessee, undertook to assess the
plaintiff in error, under the Tennessee statute, and the plaintiff
in error, denying his liability to pay any tax, the parties agreed
upon the following facts for the purpose of having the question
presented judicially and determined by the court, under the
practice in Tennessee:
"That the West Memphis Packet Company is, and has been
for more than fifteen years last past, a corporation duly created
and existing under and in accordance with the laws of the State
of Arkansas, located and having its situs at West Memphis,
in the county of Crittenden, in the State of Arkansas, situated
just opposite the lower end of the city of Memphis, across the
Mississippi River, having power by its charter to buy or build

and own one or more steamboats, barges and flatboats, and
other water craft, to be used in transporting freight and passengers on the Mississippi River, and the lakes, bayous and
other navigable streams connected therewith, within the limits
of the State of Arkansas; and during the time the said James
Foppiano was engaged in selling beer and liquors, as herein
stated, the said West Memphis Packet Company was in the
exercise of its corporate powers and privileges, and engaged
continuously in commerce between the city of Memphis, in
the State of Tennessee, and points contiguous thereto, situated
along the Arkansas shore of the Mississippi River.
"For more than fifteen years the West Memphis Packet
Company has been operating a ferry across the Mississippi
River from Hopefield Point, in Crittenden County, Arkansas,
and other points adjacent thereto in the State of Arkansas, to
and from the State of Tennessee, under licenses to operate
such ferry, regularly granted and issued to it, the West Memphis Packet Company, by the County Court of Crittenden
County, Arkansas, the tribunal authorized by the constitution
and laws of the State of Arkansas to grant and issue such
licenses-and under such licenses the West Memphis Packet
Company had been making landings regularly, at its dock, at
the wharf in the city of Memphis, on the Mississippi River, and
there receiving and discharging freight and passengers transported or to be transported by means of such ferry along and
across the Mississippi River. It had made but one landing
regularly in the course of such business in the State of Tennessee, and two or more in the State of Arkansas.
"For more than four years last past the West Memphis
Packet Company has used and employed the steamboat Chas.
H. Organ as its regular ferryboat, in carrying on the ferry
aforesaid, under its said licenses, and such steamboat had
made stated regular trips during all that time, between Memphis and the points aforesaid, in the State of Arkansas, constituting such ferry landings.

Memphis Packet Company, and was duly enrolled and licensed
as a steam vessel, to navigate the Mississippi River and its
tributaries, under the laws of the United States regulating the
coasting trade, and for other purposes, in the custom house
at Memphis-Memphis being the nearest port of the United
States to the residence of the West Memphis Packet Company,
and the home port of the said steamboat for each of the said
years 1901, 1902 and 1903, and before that time.
"Ever since the West Memphis Packet Company began the
keeping and maintaining of a ferry across the Mississippi River,
as before stated, a bar has been, and was during the years 1901,
1902 and 1903, kept and maintained on the steamboat it used
and operated for that purpose, by some individual to whom it
rented the privilege of keeping such bar, and carrying on at
the same the sale of beer and liquors, by retail, to persons
transported,. or to be transported, or upon the said steamboat.
"During the years 1901, 1902 and 1903, James Foppiano
was the lessee of the West Memphis Packet Company, and
rented such bar on the steamboat Chas. H. Organ from it, and
at such bar, during the said time, when the boat was in transit
along or across the river, or when temporarily at the landings
on the one side or the other of the river, he made sales by retail
of beer and liquors to persons transported, or being transported,
or to be transported, upon such steamboat, or who were thereon
and applied to make purchases. And for the said years 1901,
1902 and 1903 he paid no taxes on such business, and took out
no licenses therefor.
"Foi: carrying on -the said business for the said years 1901,
1902 and 1903, respectively, in- the manner aforesaid, the defendant, Robert A. Speed, as clerk of the County Court, insists that the said James Foppiano was required to, and should
have taken out a license for each year, and also, was required
to, and should have paid the tax for each year, prescribed by.
the law levying such taxes, and the costs and charges therefor
collected by him as before stated, and not having done so,

that he was authorized and required by law to make such
collections, and is not liable to repay the same.
"The said James Foppiano denies that under the facts he
was required by law to take out any licenses, or pay any taxes,
for carrying on the said business for the said years 1901, 1902
and 1903, respectively, or either of them, in the manner aforesaid. He denies that the said Robert A. Speed was authorized
or required by law to collect either the taxes collected by him
in the manner aforesaid, or the costs or charges aforesaid, or
any part thereof, and. claims that all such sums have been
illegally exacted of and collected from him and against his
will, and that he is entitled to recover them back."

and Mr. Wassell Randolph were on the brief, for plaintiff in

While on board the steamboat navigating the Mississippi
River between Arkansas and Tennessee, engaged in selling
beer and liquors, plaintiff in error was outside the jurisdiction
of Tennessee for the purposes of license and taxation, and was
exempt from license and taxation by that State under the
Constitution, treaties and laws of the United States.
The history of the United States shows that the Mississippi
River is a great national highway and cannot be under the
control, or become the property, of any one State. Packet Co.
v. Bridge Association, 38 Illinois, 478. It forms the boundary
between Tennessee and Arkansas, and between many other
States, and a vast amount of commerce is conducted on it
among the several States, and it necessarily falls under the
control of Congress, which, to a large extent, has regulated
commerce upon it. Tennessee, therefore, cannot license, tax
or regulate in any Way the navigation upon, or the use of it.

The Packet Company, a corporation of Arkansas, owned
and lawfully employed the steamboat as a ferry boat, and in
interstate commerce between Arkansas and Tennessee, in
navigating the Mississippi River, and the steamboat, when on
the Tennessee side of the main channel of the river, or landed
at Memphis, was a part of the territory -f Arkansas, and
plaintiff in error selling beer and liquors upon the steamboat,
was locally outside the jurisdiction of Tennessee, and his business, could not be made a privilege, and he was not subject
to be licensed or taxed by the State for carrying on the business.
As the Packet Company was created under the laws of
Arkansas and existed only in that State as a corporation, and
had not complied with the laws of Tennessee regulating foreign
corporations, and the business carried on by them. within the
State, it could be taken notice of or recognized in Tennessee,
if at all, only as a matter of comity. Bank v. Earle, 13 Pet.

The' steamboat was duly enrolled and licensed under the
acts of Congress regulating the coasting trade, and thereby
authorized to navigate the navigable waters of the United
States, including the Mississippi River.
The Packet Company also had licenses from the proper,
County Court of Arkansas to maintain and keep up a ferry
across the Mississippi River between Tennessee and Arkansas,
and had been for many years carrying on such ferry, and engaged in that way in interstate commerce between those States.
The carrying on of the ferry, and the commerce was lawful.

plaintiff in error on board the boat while it was employed as
a ferry and used in interstate commerce. Hall v. DeCuir 95

the boat. It is enough that the person employed on board
the ship or steamboat, in whatever capacity, has to do with

services are necessary, or at least conducive, to the preservation of the ship, or the steamboat, or the welfare of those em-

Plaintiff in error was probably the first victim .whose offense
consisted in, or liability rested on the sale of liquors and beer
on a steamboat, duly enrolled and licensed for the coasting
trade, and engaged in navigation and commerce on the Mississippi River. The omission to license and tax the selling of
beer and liquors on boats and vessels on the Mississippi River
for so long a time was a practical construction by the people
and government, of the constitution of Tennessee, as to the
right of the free use of the Mississippi River, and is entitled
to as much consideration, and the same effect as the judicial
decisions of its courts. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299; Martin

Mr. Charles T. Cates, Jr., Attorney General of the State
of Tennessee, for defendant in error:
There is a well marked distinction between the use of the
waters of a river for the purposes of commerce and navigation
and the sale of liquor by retail on a steamboat engaged in
carrying, freight and passengers from one side of such river to
the other. The waters of the Mississippi River are free to the
steamboat and no impost can be or is sought to be placed thereon, or on its right to receive and discharge passengers and
freight; but whenever such. steamboat enters the territorial
limits of the State, both it and those thereon become subject
to the police power of the State, which was not granted to

The State is not estopped to exercise the power vested in
her to regulate and control the liquor traffic upon that part
of the Mississippi River within her territory, because for a
long number of years she did not attempt to exercise any
authority over the liquor traffic upon said river, or because
that under the express provision of sec. 16,.of cL.257, of the
Acts of 1903, the State declared that the taxes upon privileges
imposed by said act, "shall not apply to any person, firm or
corporation engaged in interstate commerce. "
AIR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error contends that he rented the bar privilege from the company owning the ferryboat, and that he conducted the business .of selling liquors over the bar on the boat
pursuant to his lease, and while doing so was engaged in interstate commerce, and therefore was not liable in any manner to
be taxed on account of conducting his business in the way he
did, while within the boundaries of the State of Tennessee.
There is a distinction to be observed between the business of
the plaihtiff in error in selling- intoxicating liquors and any
other business which might have been conducted by him on the
ferryboat under the same circumstances. The general right of
the States to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors
within their borders is not denied, but how far they could prohibit- the.entrance of the liquors, or their sale, after having been
brought into the State, has been a subject of examination and
decision within late years by this court. . Bowman v. Chicago

135 U. S. 100; In'rc Rahrer, 140 U. S. 545; Rhodes v. Iowa, 170
U. S. 412; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Company, No. 1, 170
U. S. 438. The result of J.he Bowman case and Leisy case together was to uphold the right of a party to send intoxicating
liquors into another State and sell the same in such State in
their original packages. The decisions in those cases were followed by the passage of an act of Congress, commonly known as
the Wilson Act, approved August 8, 1890, 26 Stat. 313, which
provided that intoxicating liquors, when transported into another State or Territory, should, upon arrival therein, be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or
Territory, enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the
same extent and in the same manner as though such liquors
had been produced in said State or Territory. This act was
held to be constitutional in the case of In re Rahrer, 140 U. S.
545, and that by virtue of said act, state statutes might operate upon the original packages of intoxicating liquors before sale
in the State. Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412, and Vance v.
W. A. Vandercook Company, No. 1, 170 U. S. 438, held that the
state statute must permit the delivery of the liquors to the
party to whom they were consigned within the State, but that,
after such delivery, the State had power to prevent the sale of
the liquors, even in the original package.
If the liquors kept for sale at the bar on the ferryboat had
been consigned to the plaintiff in error from Arkansas, addressed to him at Memphis, although the plaintiff in error would
have had the right to a delivery of the liquors to him at the
wharf in Memphis, yet, under the act of Congress, as construed
by this court, the State could then at once have prohibited
absolutely the sale thereof, even in original packages. Of
course, if it could totally prohibit such sale, it could permit the
sale conditionally. In this case there is no consignment to any
one, but we do not see that the distinction is material. The
liquors were owned by the plaintiff in error while on the boat,
and carried along from port to port, and to be used on the boat
as the demand at the bar made necessary. The thing which

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

the plaintiff in error did was to sell the intoxicating liquors on
this ferryboat when temporarily at the wharf in Memphis, or 1
within the boundaries of the State, to persons then on the boat,
and it was on account of these sales that he was compelled to
take out a license and pay the tax therefor. Although there
was no consignment of the liquor, yet it was in the possession
of the plaintiff in error on the boat, within the State, the same
as if he hd received it therein on a consignment to him from
outside the State, and had taken portions of it while in the
State, Sold it to different persons -then on the boat, and those
pefsons had then and there taken and drank the liquor, and
then and thus the transaction had b~en commenced and ended.
The law provided no tax on any liquor in any way, but it made
it necessary for the plaintiff in error to get a license for this sale
of liquor within \the State. There was no tax levied upon the
boat or crew,\ nor upon any of the passengers, nor on any portion of the property of the company, nor on the freight carried
by it on the boat. Neither the boat nor its officers nor crew
were subjected to the payment of any fees for navigating the
waters of the river. The Supreme Court of the State observed
that the case did not show that the charter permitted the company to maintain a bar on board its boat, nor that the liquors
sold in Tennessee came from any other State; and it may be
stated here that there was no proof that the liquors were sold
in original packages, but as they were sold over the bar there
might, perhaps, be a presumption that they were not so sold.
Without deciding the case on 'these 'grounds, the state court,,
interpreting the above-mentioned act of Congress, and believing that it was following the decisions of this court, held that,
by virtue of that act, the State had the right to exact a license
as a condition precedent to the exercise of the right on the part
of the plaintiff in error to sell intoxicating liquors over the bar
on bofard the boat, while within the boundaries of the State of
Tennessee. We think the Supreme Court was right in that view
of the case.
The counsel for plaintiff in error, in a most elaborate brief,

I OPPIANO v. SPEED.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

exhibiting very grea t learning and industry, has sought to show
that the plaintiff in error was entitled to .the free navigation of
the Mississippi River, under various treaties and compacts, as
well as by the National Constitution, and to support that contention has gone back to a time prior to the war between Great
Britain and France in 1756, and has cited many cases in this
court to maintain his position. That the navigatijn of the
Mississippi River is free to every citizen of the United States
is a fact not to be questioned at this time. No one could successfully dispute it, but we think that question is not involved
in this case. When the ferryboat entered the boundaries of the
State of Tennessee, and fastened up at the wharf in Memphis,
and the plaintiff in error then sold liquors to customers as they
asked for them, he became subject to the police laws of that
State regarding the sale of intoxicating liquors. Enforcing that
law, even if it did incidentally affect the free navigation of the
Mississippi River, is justified under the act of Congress and the
decisions of this court interpreting the same. As the boat is
free to be navigated without molestation, let or hindrance, on
account of any fees, taxes, licenses or otherwise, it cannot be
held that the navigation of the Mississippi River is not free,
because while within the boundaries of the State of Tennessee
and under the authority of the act of Congress, the barkeeper
on the boat is prohibited from there selling the liquors he carries with him, without first having paid the license demanded
by the state statute.
The case of State v. Frappart,31 La. Ann. 340, was decided
in 1879, before the act of Congress was passed, and is, therefore,
not applicable to the facts of this case.
The plaintiff in error also contends that when she. Packet
Company, being a corporation of the State of Arkansas, employed the ferryboat in interstate commerce between the States
of Arkansas and Tennessee, the boat was a part of the territory
of Arkansas, and the plaintiff in error! in selling liquors upon'
the boat, was located outside the jurisdiction of the State of
Tennessee, even though, in fact, he sold the liquors while the

boat was tied to the wharf in the city of Memphis. Many cases
are cited in counsel's brief where tangible property was directly
taxed by the State, and where, it was held, that the State had
no jurisdiction, because, although the property was temporarily within the State, it was not there permanently. Hays v.
Pacific Mail Steamship Co., 17 How. 596; Morgan v. Parham,
16 Wall. 471, were cases of vessels not abiding within the State
where they were taxed, and were there but temporarily while
engaged in lawful trade and commerce, with their situs at the
home port, where the vessels belonged, and where the owners
were liable to be :taxed for the capital invested, and where the
taxes had been paid. See also Old Dominion Steimship Company v. Virginia, 198 U. S.299. Here, however, there is no
taxation of any property whatever, either ofthe boat cr the
plaintiff in error. He is simply called upon to pay a taxfor the
privilege'of doing the business in which he was engaged-that
is, the retailing of intoxicating liquors at the bar of the ferryboat-while that boat was within the jurisdiction of the State
of Tennessee. The fact that he was so engaged within the
actual territory of that State cannot be blotted out in such a
case as this by any fiction suggested by the counsel for plaintiff
in error. As we have said, we see no objection to this exercise
of the power of the State, regard being had to"the act of Congress already mentioned.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Tennessee are
Affirmed.
