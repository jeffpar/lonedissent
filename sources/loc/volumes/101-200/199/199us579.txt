ROYAL PACKING COMPANY v. UNITED STATES. 579
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that the provisions of the preceding sections shall not be so
construed as to warrant the sales of any lands belonging to the
United States which shall be reserved for public purposes, or
selected by the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries on the islands of Kadiak and Afognak, for the purposes of establishing
a fish-culture station. As the President exercised the rights
thus reserved, and declared the whole island appropriated for
the purpose of establishing a fish-culture station, and warned
all persons to depart therefrom, it is clear that the rights, if
any, previously acquired by the settlement were terminated by
the proclamation. Petitioner gained no additional consideration from the improvements put upon the land, since, if for no
other reason, these were made prior to the act of 1891, when it
was a mere trespasser and occupying the land without a shadow
of title.
Affirmed.
