Argument for Appellant.

CARROLL v. GREENWICH INSURANCE COMPANY OF
NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

No. 50.

OF IOWA.

Argued November 7, 8, 1905.-Decided November 27, 1905.

Section 1754 of the Iowa Code of 1897, prohibiting combinations of insurance companies as to rates, commissions, and manner of transacting
business, is not unconstitutional as depriving the companies of their
property or of their liberty of contract within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the auditor of the State will not be enjoined from
enforcing the provisions of the statute.
A company lawfully doing business in a State is no more bound by a general
unconstitutional enactment than a citizen of that State.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles W. Mullan and Mr. Charles A. Clark, for
appellant:
Sections 1754, 1755, 1756 and 1757 of the code of Iowa do
not yiolate or infringe § 6, Art. I, Iowa const., as they operate
equally upon every person within the relations and circumstances provided for, 'and the class of persons affected thereby
is a natural and proper class for legislative purposes, and not
.arbitrarily created by the legislature. Cooley Const. Lim.,

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill brought by a number of fire insurance companies, incorporated in States other than Iowa, to enjoin the
auditor of that State from enforcing §§ 1754, 1755 and 1756
of the Iowa Code, 1897. The ground of the bill is that these
sections are invalid under the state constitution and the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. There is a reference also to Article 1, section 10, and
an oblique suggestion that the law impairs the obligation of
contracts. The defendant demurred, and the Circuit Court
issued an injunction as prayed, which was made perpetual by
final decree. 125 Fed. Rep. 121. Thereupon the defendant
appealed to this court.
By section 1754, "It shall be unlawful for two or more fire
insurance companies doing business in this State, or for the
officers, agents or employ6s of such companies, to make or
enter into any combination or agreement relating to the rates
to be charged for insurance, the amount of commissions to be
allowed agents for procuring the same, or the manner of transacting the fire insurance business within this State; and any
such company, officer, agent or employ6 violating this pro-

vision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor," and a fine is imposed
for each offense, By § 1755 it is made the duty of the auditor
of state to summon for examination, under oath, any officer,
agent or employe suspected of violating § 1754, and if he determines that the company is guilty, or if the officer or agent
fails to appear, to revoke the authority of the company to do
business in the State for one year. By § 1756 an appeal is
given from the decision of the auditor to the District Court,
the case to be tried de novo, as equitable causes are tried. By
§ 1757 the statements made upon the examination before the
auditor or county court shall not be used in any criminal
prosecution against the person making them.
The bill sets forth the necessity for every insurance company
to gather all the experience available into one mass and to
analyze and classify it scientifically in order to ascertain the
true value of risks, and that it will add greatly to the expense
if each company is required to employ a separate person to do
the work. It charges, upon information and belief, that if the
plaintiffs attempt to combine their experience and to employ
the same person to analyze it, the auditor will summon them
and revoke their authority to do business in the State. It
further alleges that the plaintiffs desire not only to do what
has be en stated for their guidance in establishing rates, but
to agree what classes of risks are non-insurable, how various
risks shall be classified, and as to other matters relating to the
manner of doing business. It repeats the charge, upon information and belief, that if the plaintiffs proceed in this
manner the auditor will order an examination and revoke their
licenses, and prays for an injunction against enforcing in any
manner the above-mentioned sections of the Iowa Code. The
Circuit Court considered that the statute was not invalid under
the constitution of Iowa, but held that the prohibitions of
agreements as to the amount of commissions to be allowed,
or as to the manner of transacting the fire insurance business
in the State, were contrary to the Fourteenth Aiendment.
While waiving a discussion of the clause against combinations

CARROLL v. GREENWICH INSURANCE CO.

Opinion of the Court.-

as to rates, it seemingly regarded the provisions of § 1754 as
inseparable, and issued a general injunction forbidding the
enforcement against the plaintiffs of §§'1754, 1755 and 1756.
We assume, for purposes of decision, that the bill means
that the auditor threatens and intends to enforce the act in
case the plaintiffs do what they desire to do, and that if § 1754
is contrary to the Constitution of the United States, a proper
case for an injunction is made out. Osborn v. Bank of the
United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 839, 840. See Cleveland v. Cleveland City Ry. Co., 194 U. S. 517, 531 ; Detroit v. DetroitCitizens'
Street Ry. Co., 184 U. S. 368, 378. We assume further -that the
position of the plaintiffs is not affected by the fact that they
are foreign corporations. The act is in general terms, and hits
all insurance companies. If it is invalid as to some, it is invalid as to all. United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253, 262,
263: That the requirements of the act might have been made
conditions to foreign companies doing business in the State,
Fidelity Mutual Life Ins.. Co. v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308, WatersPierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28, is immaterial, since, as we
understand the statute, the legislature .did not. attempt to
reach the result in that way. A company lawfully doing business idt the State is no more bound by i general unconstitutional
enactment than a citizen of the State. W. W. Cargill Co. v.
Minnesota, 180 U. S. 452.
We pass- to the question upon which the Circuit Court decided the, case, namely, the constitutionality of § 1754, the
only section which we find it necessary to consider. Whatever may be thought of the policy of such attempts, it cannot
be denied in this 'courtj unless some of its decisions are to be
overruled, that statutes prohibiting combinations between
possible rivals in trade may be constitutional. The decisions
concern not only statutes of the United States, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, Swift & Company v.
United States, 196 'U. S. 375, but also state laws of similar import. Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. A47; National Cotton Oil
Co. v. Texas, 197 U. S. 115.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

In view of these cases further discussion is unnecessary, but
we will add a few words. While we need not affirm 'that in
no instance could a distinction be taken, ordinarily if an act
of Congress is valid under the Fifth Amendment it would be
hard to say that a state law in like terms was void under the
Fourteenth. It is true that by the provision in the body of
the instrument Congress has power to regulate commerce, and
that the act of Congress referred to in the cases cited was passed
in pursuance of that power. But even if the Fifth Amendment were read as contemporaneous with the original Constitution, the power given in the commerce clause would not
be taken to override it so far as the Fifth Ameidment protects
fundamental personal rights. It is only on the ground that
the right to combine at will is a fundamental personal right
that it can be held to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from any abridgment by the State. Cincinnati Street
Ry. Co. v. Snell, 193 U. S. 30, 36. Many state laws which limit
the freedom of contract have been sustained by this court,
and therefore an objection to this law on the general ground
that it limits that freedom cannot be upheld. There is no
greater sanctity in the right to combine than in the right to
make other contracts. Indeed, Mr. Dicey, in his recent work
on Las and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth
Century, indicates that it is out of the very right to make what
contracts one chooses, so strenuously advocated by Bentham,
that combinations have arisen which restrict the very freedom
that Bentham sought to attain, and which even might menace
the authority of the State. If then the statute before us is
to be overthrown more special reasons must be assigned.
At the argument before us more special reasons were assigned. It was pressed that there is no justification for the
particular selection of fire insurance companies for tle prohibitions discussed. With regard to this it should be observed,
as is noticed by the appellees, that a general statute of Iowa
prohibits all contracts or combinations to fix the price of any
article of merchandise or commodity, or to limit the quantity

CARROLL v. GREENWICH INSURANCE CO.

'411

Opinion of the Court.

of the same produced or sold in the State, Code of 1897, §5060,
and that this section covers fire insurance. Beechley v. Mulville, 102 Iowa, 602. Therefore the act in question does little
if anything more than apply and work out the policy of the
general law in a particular case. Again, if an evil is specially
experienced in a particular branch of business, the Constitution embodies no prohibition of laws confined to the evil, or
doctrinaire requirement that they should be couched in allembracing terms. It does not forbid the cautious advance,
step by step, and the distrust of generalities which sometimes
have been the weakness, but often the strength, of English
legislation. Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 610, 611. And if
this is true, then in view of the possible teachings to be drawn
from a practical knowledge of the business concerned, it is
proper that courts should be very cautious in condemning what
legislatures have approved.
If the legislature of the State of Iowa deems it desirable
artificially to prevent, so far as it can, the substitution of combination for competition, this court cannot say that fire insurance may not present so conspicuous an example of what
that legislature thinks an evil as to justify special treatment.
The imposition of a more specific liability upon life and health
insurance companies was held valid in Fidelity Mutual Life
Insurance Co. v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308. See also Missouri
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Mackey, 127 U. S. 205; Orient Insurance Co.
v. Daggs, 172 U. S. 557; Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606; Home
Life Insurance Co. v. Fisher, 188 U. S. 726, 727.
But it is said that, however it may be as to some regulations
of fire insurance, these, or at least the last two of them, forbidding agreements as to agents' commissions and the manner
of transacting business, are not to be justified. In order to
make this out the scope of the provisions was exaggerated both
in the argument and in the bill. The bill seems to assume that
the statute forbids insurance companies to obtain and use each
other's experience, or to employ the same person to work up
the results. It does not. It simply forbids an agreement be-

tween the companies relating to the rates which may be based
upon those results. No doubt an agreement between the
companies readily would be inferred, if they were found all
to charge the same rates; but an agreement between the companies is the only thing aimed at, and if they avoid that they
escape the law. So it was suggested in argument that they
could not employ the same adjuster in case of loss. We do
not perceive anything to hinder their doing so, although it may
be that they would have to be careftil about the terms of his
authority. The object of the law, we assume, until the Iowa
Court shall decide otherwise, is single, to keep up competition,
and the general language is to be restricted by the specific
provisions and to the particular end. Limited as we understand it to be limited, the statute goes no further than others
vhich have been sustained, and does not contravene the Constitution of the United States.
The argument before us very properly was rested on the
Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore it is unnecessary to discuss the other objections suggested in the bill.
Although we have conceded that th6 bill makes a case for
an injunction if its premises are tru6, it cannot be understood
to charge that the auditor will go further than to enforce the
act as properly construed. The allegations upon information
and belief, which we have stated, probably mean no more than
that the plaintiffs reasonably suppose that the auditor will
do his duty. They are pressed to the verge when they aretaken to set forth a threat to do that. They certainly do not
show that he threatens to do more.

It is clear from the averments of the bill that the insurance
companies had not, prior to the institution of this suit, made
any combination or agreement, amiong themselves, relating to
the rates-to be charged for insurance or to the amount of com-

missions to be allowed agents for procuring insurance or to
the manner of transacting fire insurance business within the
State. They expressed a desire to make such a combination
or agreement, but were apprehensive that by doing so they
would come into conflict with the state authorities. The
auditor had done nothing under the statute and will have
nothing to do in execution of it, provisions, unless the insurance companies enter into the forbidden combination or
agreement. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs caine into court, avowed
that they had not as yet violated the statute, but asked to be
informed whether, in the event they concluded to do so, their
officers, agents or enploys could be legally summoned before
the state auditor for examination, as prescribed in section 1755.
In other words, in advance of anything being done in violation
of the statute or of any steps being taken by the auditor in
execution of its provisions, the opinion of the court was asked
and obtained as to its constitutionality. This is a very convenient-and, in my judgment, a ischievous-mode of obtaining the opinion of a court upon an abstract question of
the constitutionality of a statute which has not been and may
never be violated, and under which no case may ever arise
calling for judicial interference. It is as if the plaintiffs had
addressed a personal communication to the court asking to be
informed as to what they might safely do. It seems to me
that the suit has been prematurely brought. If the plaintiffs
should make such a combination as is forbidden by the statute, the time to seek judicial interference in their behalf would
be when the state auditor proceeds or in some definite way
indicates his purpose to proceed under section 1755. I think
the decree below should be reversed and the bill ordered to be
dismissed, upon the ground that no facts existed, at the time
the suit was brought, to justify a judicial tribunal in delivering a judgment to the constitutionality of the state statute.
As, however, the court considered the case upon the merits,
it is appropriate to say that I concur with the court in holding
that the section of the statute which is assailed is not invalid.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Syllabus.

199 U. S.

The business of fire insurance is of such a peculiar character,
so intimately connected with the prosperity of the whole comiunity, and so vital to the security of property owners, that
it is competent for the State to forbid combinations and agreements among fire insurance companies doing business within
its limits, in reference to rates, agents' commissions and the
manner of transacting their business. If, in the judgment of
the State, the people who desire insurance upon their property
are put at a disadvantage when confronted by a combination
or agreement among insurance companies, I do not perceive
any sound reason why, preserving the individual right of contracting, it may not forbid such combinations and agreements,
and thereby enable the insured and insurer to meet on terms
of equality. Surely, the State could enact such a regulation
with reference to companies organized under its own -lawss.
If that be so, it cannot be that such a regulation may not be
made applicable to foreign insurance companies doing business in the State only by its consent.
