OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

199 U. S.

In what has been said we do not wish it to be understood
that this court intimates an opinion upon the alleged invalidity
of the statute upon the above ground. We simply say that
the plaintiff in error cannot raise that question.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Ohio are
Affirmed.

RANKIN v. BARTON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
No. 125.

Submitted October 17, 1905.-Decided November 13, 1905.

A national bank is an instrumentality of the United States, the administration. whereof is vested in the Comptroller of the Currency, who, in case of
insolvency, appoints the receiver and directs his acts. The liability for
assessment on the stock dates from the order of the Comptroller who decides when it is necessary to institute proceedings therefor, and his determination is conclusive. This power is derived from a statute of the United
States and cannot be controlled or limited by state statutes.
Where the state court has held th. a suit to collect assessment by the receiver of a national bank under directions of the Comptroller of the Currency is barred by a state statute of limitations, a Federal question is involved and the writ of error will not be dismissed.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

class of actions and the statute of limitations of the State in
which the action is brought controls. Campbell v. Haverhill,
'155 U. S. 610;.Price v. Yates, 2 National Bank Cases (Brown),
204.
A statute of a State is whatever the court of last resort in
such State construes it to be. McElmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet.
312-, Bauserman v. Blunt, 147 U. S. 647; Metcalf v. Watertown, 153 U. S. 671; Balkman v. Woodstock Iron Co., 154 U. S.
177.
So that this court looks not only to the statute but to the
decision .of the highest coirt of the State in order to ascertain
what the statute is.
In Kansas the rule is that the bar of the statute cannot be
postponed by the failure of the creditor to avail himself of any
meang within his power to prosecute or to preserve his claim,
and that action must be taken within a reasonable time; and
,that, in no event, will such reasonable time be extended beyond the statutory period of limitation. A., T. & S. F. R. R.

Kansas, 176; Bauserman v. Charlotte, 46 Kansas, 480; Kulp v.
Kulp, 51 Kansas, 391.
There is no Federal question involved.
The validity of a statute or treaty of the United States is
not drawn in question within the meaning of this section every
time rights claimed under a statute or treaty are controvertible, nor is the validity of an authority every time an act done
by an authority is disputed. Kennard v. Nebraska, 186 U. S.
304; Florida Railroad Co. v. Belle, 176 U. S. 321; Blackburn v.

In the case at bar there is no question raised as to the validity of the statute, under which the Comptroller acts, nor as to

his power to act, but the question is what is the statute of
limitations in such cases in the State of Kansas. And this
court will not review the decision of the state court construing its own statute of limitations. Telegraph Co. v. Purdy,
162 U. S. 329; Walsh v. Columbus &c. R. R. Co., 176 U. S. 469;
Hamblin v. Western Land Co., 147 U. S. 531; New Orleans v.
Water Works Co., 142 U. S. 79; Harrison v. Myer, 92 U. S.
111.
Where a state law is admitted to be valid and the only question 'is whether it has been correctly construed, the Supreme
Court of the United States has no jurisdiction to review the
state court. Congdon Mining Company v. Goodman, 2 Black,
574; Scott v. Jones, 5 How. 343; Commercial Bank v. Buckingham, 5 How. 317.
A decision of the state court resting upon the construction
and not upon the validity of a state statute does not present a
Federal question. Railroad Co. v. Marsher, 12 How. 165;
Snell v. Chicago, 152 U. S. 191.
Decisions based on local laws not involving constitutional
questions are not reviewable. Hibben v. Smith, 191 U. S.310;
Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.
The question in this case is the application of the statute of
limitations of a State to the liability of a stockholder of a national bank before the amount of such liability has been ascertained and assessed by the Comptroller of the Currency. The
trial court held the statute applicable, and its judgment was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.
The petition was filed November 13, 1902, and averred that
the Hutchinson National Bank became insolvent in 1893, and
defendant in error Was appointed its receiver. On July 19,
1894, the Comptroller of the Currency ordered an assessment
of $75,000 upon the individual liability of the stockholders,
being $75 on each share, to pay the debts of the bank. After

application of the amounts collected, and after further accounting, it was found necessary to make another assessment, and
on November 20, 1900, the Comptroller of the Currency made
another assessment of $19,000, being $19 upon each share.
It was averred "that said assessment was made just as soon
as discovered in the exercise of diligence to be necessary, and
just as soon as it was ascertained that the first assessment and
assets of the bank were insufficient." The amount due from
defendant in error was $627, for which judgment was prayed.
A demurrer was sustained to the petition on the ground that
it showed on its face that .the cause of the action was barred
by the statute of limitations of the State. In sustaining this
ruling the Supreme Court of the State said: (1) That although
the cause of action arose under the act of Congress, which prescribed no limitation on the remedy against stockholders, the
statute of the State applied; and (2) the statute commenced to
run not when the assessment was made against a stockholder,
but was put in motion by delay in making the assessment.
Prior decisions of the Supreme Court of thc State were relied
on for this conclusion. They established the local law to be,
it was said, that when an act to be done is wholly within the
control of the party suing, he must perform it within a reasonable time, and such time cannot extend the period within
which the action would be barred, if no such preliminary step
were necessary. And it was decided that the averment of the
petition, that the second assessment was made as soon as it
was discovered to be necessary, was a mere conclusion of the
pleader, which was countervailed by the facts alleged.
We think the court overlooked the official character and
power of the Comptroiler of the Currerfcy, and the decisions of
this court declaring them. A national bank is an instrumentality of the United States, its circulating notes are guaranteed
by the United States, and if the United States should be compelled to pay them the United States has a paramount lien on
the assets of the bank for reimbursement. The administration of the bank's assets is, therefore, vested in the Comptroller

of the Currency as an officer of the United States. He appoints
the receiver and directs his acts. The individual liability of a
stockholder can only be enforced by his order. The provision
is as much for the benefit of the stockholders as for the United
States, an'l it is indispensable to the bringing of a suit against
the stockholder. In other words, the liability dates from the
order of the Comptroller. It was said in Kennedy v. Gibson,
8 Wall. 498, 505: "It is for the Comptroller to decide when it
is necessary to institute proceedings against the stockholders
to enforce their personal liability, and whether the whole or a
part, and if only a part, how much, shall be cbllected. These
questions are referred to his judgment and discretion, and his
determination is conclusive. The stockholders cannot controvert it. It is not to b~e questioned in the litigation that
may ensue. He may make it at such times as he may deem
proper, and upon such data as shall be satisfactory to him.
This action on his part is indispensable, whenever the personal
liability of the stockholders-is sought to be enforced, and must
precede the institution of suit by the receiver. The fact must
be distinctly averred in all such cases, and if put in issue -must
be proved." Subsequent cases have reiterated the doctrine.
McDonald -v. Thompson, 184 U. S. 71; Studebaker v. Perry,
184 U. S. 258. As the power of the Comptroller is derived
from a statute of the United States, it cannot be controlled or
limited by state statutes.
A motion is made by defendant in error to dismiss the writ
of error for want of jurisdiction in this court. It is manifest
from what we have said that the notion is without foundation.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for 1urther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
