THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK ex rel.
LIEBERMAN v. VAN DE CARR, WARDEN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 71.

Argued November 0, 1905.-Decided December 11, 1905.

A State has the right, in the exercise of the police power, and with a view
to protect the public healt4 and welfare, to make reasonable regulations
in regard to such occupations as may, if unrestrained, become unsafe
or dangerous, and the conferring of discretionary power Vpon administrative boards to grant or withhold permission to carry on such a trade
or business is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. There is
no presumption that a power granted to an administrative board will be
arbitrarily or improperly exercised,* and this court will not interfere
with the exercise of such a power where the record does not disclose any
ground on which the board acted.
It is primarily for the State to select the businesses to be regulated, and
if those selected are proper subjects for regulation, those engaged therein
are not denied the equal protection of the laws because other businesses
are not subjected to similar regulations, provided all engaged in the
same business are treated alike.
Section 66 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York, regulating the
sale of milk in that city, as the same has been construed by the highest
court of that state, held not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as
depriving those engaged in that business of their property without
due process of law or denying them the equal protection of the laws.
THE facts, which involved the constitutionality of section 66
of the Sanitary Code of the city of New York in regard to the
sale of milk in that city, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Frank Moss for plaintiff in error:
The section of the Sanitary Code involved in this action is
unconstitutional and repugnant to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is an ordinance enforced by the State, under section 1172
of the city charter, which abridges the privileges and immunities of citizens, and deprives person,. of property without due
process of law, and denies to persons the equal protection of the

laws. It is not designed to protect the health of the public, and
is not in any view necessary, but is an instrument of oppression,
which gives to the unelected Board of Health, arbitrary powers,
the misuse of which cannot be corrected by mandamus, appeal,
or other legal proceedings. The Board of Health has unnecessarily and unduly selected this business out of many others
holding similar relations to the public, and has imposed its prohibition by the permit system on it alone.
. Section 66 puts the holding, keeping, selling and delivering
of milk under the arbitrary and absolute power of the: Board
of Health, without declaring any lines or linits for the exercise of its prohibitive action, and it allows the Board to load
its permits with conditions, the nature of which is not indicated
or limited in the ordinance or in the code.
The language of the section permits unjust discrimination
and the evils of. its abuse cannot be corrected by mandamus.

that the validity of a statute is not to be deternliiked by what
has been done in a particular instance, but by what may be
done under it.

The performance by boards of health of the duties intrusted

MR. JUSTIcE DAY delivered ,the opinion of the court.
Simon Lieberman was arrested and held for trial by a magistrate of the city of New York, charged with violating section 66
'of the, sanitary code of New York city. After being committed
to the custody of the warden of the city prison, plaintiff in error
sued out a writ of habeas corpus.
At the hearing before a justice of the Supreme Court at special term the writ was dismissed and the prisoner remanded to
the custody of the warden. Upon appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court the order of the special term was
affirmed. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals
of the State of New York, 175 N. Y. 440, and the case remitted
to the Supreme Court, where judgment was entered on the remittitur. The case was then broughft here by writ of error.
The section of the sanitary code complained of is as follows:
"SEc. 66. No milk shall be received, held, kept, either for
sale or delivered in the city of New York, without a pernit in
writing from the board of health, and subject to the conditions
thereof."
The violation of the sanitary code is made a misdemeanor.
That the board of health had power to pass the sanitary code,
which includes this section, is not open to question here, as it
has been affirmatively decided in the state court. The objec-,
tions on Federal grounds for our consideration are twofold;

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

first, that the section under consideration devolves upon the
board of health absolute and despotic power to grant or withhold permits to milk dealers, and is, therefore, not due process
of law; second, that singling out the milk business for regulation is a denial of the equal protection of the laws to people
engaged therein.
The record discloses that the plaintiff in error, engaged in
selling milk in the city of New York before his arrest, had a
permit, which was revoked by the board of health. He was
thereafter found engaged through an agent.in selling milk without a permit. In the testimony it appears in a conversation
between the plkintiff in error and an inspector in' te department of health, the latter admitted that Lieberman's milk
"stood well."
The right of the State to regulate certain occupations which
may become unsafe or dangerous when unrestrained, in the
exercise of the police power, with a view to protect the public
health and welfare, has been so often and so recently before
this court that it is only necessary to refer to some of the cases
which sustain the proposition that the State has a right, 'by
reasonable regulations, to protect the public health and safety.
Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U. S. 25; New Orleans Gas Co. v.
Louisiana Light Co., 115 U. S. 650; Crowley v. Christensen, 137
U. S. 86; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133;'Jacobsonv. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11; and Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction
Works, ante p. 306; Gardner v. Michigan, ante p. 325 decided
at this term.
The contention of counsel for appellant is not that a business
so directly affecting the health of the inhabitants of the city as
the furnishing of milk may not be the subject of regulation
under the authority of the State, but that the Court of Appeals
of New York has sustained this right of regulation to the extent of authorizing the board of health to exercise arbitrary
power in the selection of those it may see fit to permit to sell
milk under the section quoted; and thus construed it works
the deprivation of the plaintiff in error's liberty and property

LIEBERMAN v. VAN DE CARR.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

without due process of law. We do not so understand the decision of tle highest court of New York. As we read it the
authority sustained is the grant of power to issue or withhold
permits in the honest exercise of a reasonable discretion. In
the opinion of the Appellate Division, whose judgment was
affirmed in the Court of Appeals, it was said:
"Such regulations, however, should be uniform, and the
board should not act arbitrarily; and if this section of the sanitary code vested in them arbitrary power to license one dealer,
and refuse a license to another similarly situated, undoubtedly
it would be invalid, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183; Noel v. People, 187 Illinois, 587;
Dunham v. Trustees of Rochester, 5 Cow. 462; City of Brooklyn
v. Breslin, 57 N. Y. 591; but such was not its purpose, nor is
that its fair construction.
"It is unnecessary now to determine whether the action of
the board in refusing or revoking such a permit would be judicial and thus reviewable by mandamus or certiorari, or whether,,
if the authority should be arbitrarily or improperly exercised,
the only remedy would be an application for the removal of the
officers; for those are questions that may arise in the administration of the law, but do not go to its validity. The section,
properly construed, does not permit unjust discrimination, and,
therefore, it is valid."
The Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of the Appellate
Division, did not speak with equal emphasis upon this point,
but it leaves no doubt that it sustained the statute as authorizing the exercise of a reasonable discretion. While that court
held that the discretion to grant or withhold permits might be
vested in a board of health with opportunities to know and
investigate local conditions and surroundings, it further said:
"In the case before us the requirement of section 66 of the
sanitary code that the relator should not sell nfilk without a
permit is reasonable and violates neither Federal nor state
Constitution, is in accordance with law and long established
precedent.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

"In the argument of this case several questions have been
discussed that are not presented by the appeal. It is, for instance, argued that even conceding a permit to be necessary,
the provision that the holder is to be 'subject to the conditions
thereof,' cannot be sustained for a variety of reasons suggested.
"It is a complete answer that the form of the permit is not
in the record; it does not appear that it has, attached to it,
conditions reasonable or otherwise. We consequently express
no opinion on the subject.
"What we have already said applies with equal force to the
argument that the permit might be loaded with conditions, the
nature of which is not limited or stated; that it may be used to
build up monopoly, to help a favored few as opposed to the
many; that there is no other statute which presents such possibilities for blackmail and oppression. These and many other
like criticisms are indulged in by appellant.
"If the question was before us, the well-settled canon of construction permits of no such argument.
"It is presumed that public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law."
We do not think that this language leaves any question as to,
disposition of the highest court of New York to prevent the
oppression of the citizen, or the deprivation of his rights, by an
arbitrary and oppressive exercisr. , f the power conferred. That
this court will not interfere becase the States have seen fit to
give administrative discretion to local boards to grant or withhold licenses or permits to ,aryy on trades or occupations, or
perform acts which are properly the subject of regulation in the
exercise of the reserved power of the States to protect the health
and safety of its people there can be no doubt. In Davis v.
Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43, an ordinance of the city of Boston
providing that no person shall make any public address in or
upon the public grounds, except in accordance with a permit
from the mayor, was held not in conflict with the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In Wilson v. Eureka City, 173 U. S. 32, an ordinance requiring persons

LIEBERMAN v. VAN DE CARR.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to obtain written permission from the mayor or president of
the city council, or in their absence a councillor, before moving
a building upon any of the public streets of the city, was sustained as not violative of the Federal Constitution. In the
opinion of the court a number of instances were given in which
acts were prohibited except with the consent of an administrative board, and which were sustained as proper exercises of the
police power. In Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183, an ordinance was sustained permitting the mayor to license persons
to deal in cigarettes when he was satisfied that the person applying for the license was of good character and reputation and
a suitable person to be intrusted with their sale. And in the
recent case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, this court
sustained a compulsory vaccination law which delegated to the
boards of health of cities or towns the determination of the necessity of requiring the inhabitants to submit to compulsory
vaccination. And in Fischer v. St. Louis, 194 U. S.361, an
ordinance of the city of St. Louis providing that no dairy or
cow stable should thereafter be built or established within the
limits of the city, and no such stable not in existence at the
time of the passage of the ordinance should be maintained on
any premises, unless permission should have been first obtained
from the municipal assembly by ordinance, was sustained as a
proper exercise of the police power. After sustaining the right
to vest in a board of men acquainted with the local conditions
of the business to be carried on, power to grant or withhold
permits, this court said:
"It has been held in some of the state courts to be contrary
to the spirit of American institutions to vest this dispensing
power in the hands of a single individual, Chicago v. Trotter,
136 Illinois, 430; Matter of Frazee, 63 Michigan, 396; State v.
Fisk, 9 R. I. 94; Baltimore v. Radecke, 49 Maryland, 217; Sioux
Falls v. Kirby, 6 S.Dak. 62, and in others that such authority
cannot be delegated to the adjoining lot owners. St. Louis v.
Russell, 116 Missouri, 248; Ex parte Sing Lee, 96 California, 354.
But the authority to delegate that discretion to a board apVOL. cxcix-36

pointed for that purpose is sustained by the great weight of
authority, Quincy v. Kennard, 151 Massachusetts, 563; Commonwealth v. Davis, 162 Massachusetts, 510, and by this court
the delegation of such power, even to a single individual, was
sustained in Wilson v. Eureka City, 173 U. S. 32, and Gundling
v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183."
These cases leave in no doubt the proposition that the conferring of discretionary power upon administrative boards to
grant or withhold permission to carry on a trade or business
which is the proper subject of regulation within the police power
of the State is not violative of rights secured by the Fourteenth
Amendment. There is no presumption that the power will be
arbitrarily exercised, and when it is shown to be thus exercised
against the individual, under sanction of state authority, this
court has not hesitated to interfere for his protection, when the
case has come before it in such manner as to authorize the interference of a Federal.court. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.
356. In the case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, supra, it was
insisted that the compulsory vaccination ordinance was broad
enough to require a person to submit to compulsory vaccination when his physical condition might be such as to render
such treatment dangerous to life and even cruelly oppressive.
But it was held that the case presented no such situation; that
the person complaining of the enforcement of the ordinance
was, for aught that appeared, an adult in good health and a
proper subject for vaccination; that the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts had not sustained the authority of the board in
the extreme case supposed, and that the individual complaining
made.no case wherein the operation of the statute deprived him
of his constitutional right of protection. So, in the present
case, there is nothing in this record to show why the permit
which had been granted to the plaintiff in error was revoked or
the conditions upon which, in the exercise of the power conferred by section 66, a permit to carry on the business was
granted or withheld. It is true that a conversation was proved
in which the milk inspector said to Lieberman that the milk

LIEBERMAN v. VAN DE CARR.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

sold by him "stood well;" but there is nothing to show upon
what ground the action of the board was taken. For aught
that appears he may have been conducting his business in such
wise, or with such surroundings and means, as to render it dangerous to the health of the community, or his manner of selling
or delivering the milk may have been objectionable. There is
nothing in the record to show that the action against him was
arbitrary or oppressive and without a fair and reasonable exercise of that discretion which the law reposed in the board of
health. We have, then, an ordinance which, as construed in
the highest court of the State, authorizes the exercise of a legal
discretion in the granting or withholding of permits to transact
a business, which, unless controlled, may be highly dangerous
to the health of the community, and no affirmative showing
that the power has been exerted in so arbitrary and oppressive
a manner as to deprive the appellant of his property or liberty
without due process of law.
In such cases it is the settled doctrine of this court that no
Federal right is invaded, and no-authority exists for declaring
a law unconstitutional, duly passed by 6he legislative authority
and approved by the highest court of the State. Nor do we
think there is force in the contention that the appellant has
been denied the equal protection of the laws, because of the
allegation that the milk business is the only business dealing
in foods which is thus regulated by the sanitary code. All
milk dealers within the city are equally affected by the regulations of the sanitary code. It is primarily for the State to select the kinds of business which shall be the subjects of regulation, and if the business affected. is one which may be properly
the subject of such legislation, it is no valid objection that similar regulations are not imposed upon other businesses of a different kind. Soon Hing v. Crowley, 113 U. S. 703; Fischer
v. St. Louis, 194 U. S. 361.
We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of
New York, and the same is
AIrmed.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES. I 'do not gather from the statute or
from the decision of the Court of Appeals that the action of the
board of health was intended to be subject to judicial revision
as to its reasonableness. But whether it was or was not, I
agree that the statute, which in substance is older than the
Fourteenth Amendment, was not repealed or overthrown by
the adoption of that Amendment.

1. The Northern Pacific Railroad Company could not acquire a vested interest in particular lands, within or without place limits, merely by filing
a map of general route and having the same approved by the Secretary
of the Interior, although upon the definite location of its line of toad and
the filing and acceptance of a map thereof in the office of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, the lands within primary or place limits, not
theretofore reserved, sold, granted or otherwise disposed of and free from
preemption or other claims or rights, become segregated from the public
domain, and no rights in such place lands will attach in favor of any
settler or occupant, after definite location.
2. No rights to lands within indemnity limits will attach in favor of the
railroad company until after selections made by it with the approval of
the Secretary of the Interior.

although embraced by the company's list of selections, are subject to
be disposed of by the United States or to be settled upon and occupied
under the preemp~tion and homestead laws of the United States.
4. The Secretary of the Interior has no authority to withdraw from sale
or settlement lands within the indemnity limits which have not been
previously selected, with his approval, to supply deficiencies within the
place limits of the company's r~ad.
