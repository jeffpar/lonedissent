If we are to follow on this subject the ruling of the State courts,
we should be obliged to give a different interpretation to the
same act -the reception of goods marked for a place beyond
the road of the company - in different States, holding it to
imply one thing in Illinois and another in Massachusetts.

BUsH v. KENTUCKY.
1. Where the Circuit Court quashes an indictment, found against the prisoner in
a State court, wherefrom the cause was on his petition removed, it has no
jurisdiction to proceed against him for the crime against the State wherewith he was charged.
2. Where the highest court of the State had declared to be unconstitutional
her statute whereby, because of their race and color, citizens of African
descent were excluded from grand and petit juries, and it had further decided that the officer summoning or selecting jurors must disregard race or
color, a person of that descent against whom a criminal prosecution was
subsequently instituted in the State court has no just ground for declaring,
in advance of a trial, that he was denied, or that in the State tribunals he
cannot enforce, the equal civil rights secured to him as a citizen by the
Constitution or the statutes of the United States. The case was not, therefore, removable to the Circuit Court, nor should the panel of petit jurors be
set aside simply on the ground that it consisted wholly of white persons.
3. Where pursuant to such a statute, and before its unconstitutionality was so
declared, the grand jurors were selected who found the indictment against
the prisoner, a person of that descent, the court of original jurisdiction
should, on his motion, set aside the indictment.

confused, that it is impossible to ascertain what facts were
before the inferior State court when it passed certain orders
that are commented upon in argument. Some of those orders
refer to affidavits and other documents that are not made in
any form a part of the record. The difficulties in our way
have been, in part, removed by the frank concessions of counsel
on both sides, and we cheerfully acknowledge the aid we have
received from them in our search through the record for the
substantial questions to be determined. We may also add,
that our embarrassment has been increased by the consideration
that the case is one of no small moment, involving, as it does,
on the one hand, the life of a citizen, and on the other, the
question whether the judicial tribunals of a State have denied
to a prisoner rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States. Whether the record before us shows such a
denial we will now proceed to inquire.
John Bush, a citizen of African descent, was indicted in 1879
in the Circuit Court for Fayette County, Kentucky, for murder.
Upon his first trial the jury, as was stated by counsel, being
unable to agree, were discharged. At the next trial he was
found guilty, and condemned to suffer death. Upon appeal to
the Court of Appeals that judgment was reversed and a new
trial ordered for errors committed by the court of original
jurisdiction: first, in neglecting to instruct as to involuntary
manslaughter, as distinguished from murder, the evidence being such as to authorize the jury to find the accused guilty of
either offence; second, in defining the term "malice;" third, in
failing properly to instruct whether the death of the deceased
was necessarily or probably caused by the wound or ensued
from scarlet fever negligently communicated by her physician.
Bush v. Commonwealth, 78 Ky. 268.
Upon the return of the case the accused, as we infer from
the record, filed a petition for its removal to the Circuit Court
of the United States. That petition, we are informed by counsel, was filed My 24, 1880. It, however, is not in the record.
We assume that it was based upon sect. 641 of the Revised
Statutes, which authorizes, in general, the removal into such
court of any criminal prosecution, commenced in a State court,
for any cause whatever, against any person who is denied or can-

[Sup. ot.

not enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State, or in the part
of the State where the prosecution is pending, any right secured
to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens
of the United States, or of all persons within their jurisdiction.
The record, however, does state that copies of all the proceedings in the inferior State court were filed by the accused in
the Federal court, before which he was brought upon a writ of
habeas corpus addressed to the jailer having him in custody.
On the 19th of October, 1880, the accused by his counsel
moved in the Federal court that the trial proceed. That motion was denied, and the response by the jailer to the writ of
habeas corpus was adjudged to be insufficient. The reasons
which controlled this action are set forth in the following
order: 1"And it appearing to the court from the transcript of the record
heretofore filed that the indictment herein was found by a grand
jury, summoned under and in accordance with the provisions of
section 1, chapter 62, General Statutes of Kentucky, which excludes
all other than white citizens from being summoned, or serving
thereon, the court is of opinion that said law is a violation of the
14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and
orders said indictment quashed.
"The marshal of the court is ordered to return the said John
Bush to Lexington, Kentucky, as speedily as possible, and there release him. He will, however, before setting him at liberty, notify
the Commonwealth's attorney, or, in his absence, the county attorney, or, in his absence, the county judge. This notice shall be in
writing, stating the time and place of his release, and he will report
his action to this court.
"The defendant excepts to so much of this order as requires his
return to Lexington, Kentucky."
The accused was subsequently arrested by the State authorities and a new indictment returned for the same offence. At
the term of the court held on the 6th of December, 1880, he
tendered an affidavit, stating that "on the fotirth day of February, 1879, the grand jury of Fayette County returned into
this court an indictment charging him with the same offence,
and upon the same statement of facts charged herein; that he,
as he had a right to do under the 641st section of the Revised

Octl. 1882.]

BUSH

V. KENTUCKY.

Statutes of the United States, filed in this court his petition
for a transfer of his case to the United States Circuit Court for
this district for trial under said indictment; that the prayer of
his petition was granted by said Circuit Court, on which, under
said statute, all further proceedings were to cease forever; that
the jurisdiction of said United States Circuit Court, to which,
under said statute, this cause was removed for the trial of this
offence, is superior to and in exclusion of that of this court,
and, that court having taken jurisdiction, this court has no
jurisdiction to try the same." Copies of the orders of the
United States Circuit Court were made part of that affidavit.
The court refused its permission to file such affidavit, and to
that ruling the accused excepted. The case was then continued
to the succeeding February Term, when a special venire issued,
commanding the sheriff to summon "one hundred and fifty
good and lawful jurors from whom to select a jury for the trial
of this [Bush's] case." But at that term the prosecution was
continued, and on May 16, 1881, the case being again called
for trial, the sheriff was ordered to summon "a panel of seventy-five additional jurors from whom to select a jury for the
trial of this case, and in executing this order he will proceed in
his selections without regard to race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
We next find in the record of proceedings in the State court,
under date of May 18, 1881, this order: "And afterwards, at a term of said court held for said circuit,
May 18, 1881, the Commonwealth came, by attorney, and the defendant appeared in custody. The defendant moves the court to
set aside tie indictment herein against him, because there was a substantial eror committed to his prejudice in the selection and formation of the grand jury which found said indictment, in that the said
grand jury was selected and formed in violation of the Constitution
of the United States, and therefore is unconstitutional, null, and
void, because all citizens of the United States and State of Kentucky, and resident in Fayette County, who were not of the class
known as white, though eligible for such service, were excluded
from the lists from which said grand jury was selected, and thereby
the rights, privileges, and immunities of all such citizens so residing,
who did not belong to the class known as white, and of the defendVOL.XVII,

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

[Sup. Ct.

ant, who is not white, although a citizen of the United States and
of Fayette County, Kentucky, were abridged because he and they
are not white, and on account of his and their race and color, contrary to the Constitution of the United States and the laws in such
cases made and provided; which was overruled by the court, and
defendant excepts."
The accused then moved to set aside the panel of petit jurors, upon grounds set forth in the following order entered on
the same day: "The defendant now moves the court to set aside the panel of
petit jurors selected and summoned to try him herein, because
there was a substantial error committed to his prejudice, in that
said jurors were not summoned as required by law, in that all citizens of the United States and State of Kentucky, resident in Fayette County, of the African race, of which there are very many
eligible and qualified to serve as jurors in Fayette County, and to
which race this defendant belongs, were excluded and not summoned by the officers whose duty it was to select and summon said
panel to serve on said panel from which the jury to try defendant
was to be selected, but only such citizens eligible and qualified
which belonged to the class known as white were selected and
summoned by such officers. Defendant filed a petition for the
transfer of this case to the Circuit Court of the United Statesfor
Kentucky, which motion was overruled, and defendant excepts."
The trial proceeded, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty
of murder; and, under the power vested in them by the laws
of Kentucky, fixed the punishment at death. A judgment having been rendered accordingly, a motion for a new trial was
made and overruled. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals the
judgment was affirmed.
This statement of facts is quite sufficient to indicate the
grounds upon which we rest our determination of such of the
questions raised by the assignment of errors as we deem it
necessary to consider.
1. The proposition in behalf of the accused to which we will
first direct our attention is, that the removal of the prosecution
under the first indictment into the Circuit Court of the United
States - although the indictment was there quashed - operated to divest the State court of all jurisdiction thereafter,

Oct. 1882.]

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

under any circumstances whatever, to try him for the crime
charged.
Such a construction of sect. 641 is wholly inadmissible. The
prosecution against Bush could only have been commenced in
the judicial tribunals of Kentucky. The crime for which he
was indicted, being an offence against the laws of that State,
not against those of the United States, was not originally cognizable in the courts of the Union. The removal of the first
indictment into the Federal court was competent only because
at that time he was denied, by the statutes of Kentucky, rights
secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United
States. And when the Federal court in that mode acquired
jurisdiction to proceed, as if the prosecution had been there
commenced, its authority was limited to the trial of the indictment so removed. That court had, pending the prosecution
therein, the sime power over the indictment that the State
court could have exercised had there been no removal. When,
therefore, the Federal court, in the exercise of the discretion
which it unquestionably had, quashed the indictment, it was
without jurisdiction further to proceed against the defendant
for the crime. He could not have been held for indictment by
a grand jury in that court, for the obvious reason already suggested that his offence was not one against the United States,
but against Kentucky. It was for the authorities of the latter
alone to determine whether he should be again indicted, or the
prosecution be abandoned.
It follows that there was no error in the order directing the
prisoner to be returned to the county in which he was originally indicted. That course was due to the State to the end
that its authorities, being duly notified, might take such further
action in the premises as they should deem expedient. Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509; United States v. MBratney,
104 id. 621; United States v. Cisna, 1 McLean, 254.
2. But it is contended, upon behalf of the accused, that his
petition for removal, filed after the second indictment was
returned, should have been granted, and that the State court
could not thereafter rightfully proceed. The petition referred
to is doubtless the one described in the order of May 18, 1881.
But the record contains no copy of it; nor did it appear in the

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

[Sup. Ct.

record sent to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. The same
question having*been raised in that court, it replied properly
that "an inspection of the petition is essential to determine
whether it contained allegations sufficient to authorize a transfer, and, in its absence, it must be presumed that it was defective in the allegation of jurisdictional facts, and, therefore, that
the court below did right to disregard it."
But there is another and distinct ground upon which that
petition, assuming that it was based upon sect. 641, was properly disregarded by the inferior State court. The Court of
Appeals of Kentucky, in Commonwealth v. Johnson, 78 Ky.
509, decided June 29, 1880 (and hereafter more fully referred
to), had declared that the statutes of Kentucky excluding
from a grand or a petit jury citizens of African descent because
of their race or color, was unconstitutional, and that thereafter
every officer charged with the duty of selecting or summoning
jurors must so act without regard to race or color. That decision was binding as well upon the inferior courts of Kentucky
as upon all of its officers connected with the administration of
justice. After that decision, so long as it was unmodified, it
could not have been properly said in advance of, a trial that
the defendant in a criminal prosecution was denied or could
not enforce in the judicial tribunals of Kentucky the rights
secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights
of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within their
jurisdiction. The last indictment was consequently not removable into the Federal court for trial under sect. 641 at any time
after the decision in Commonwealth v. Johnson bad been pronounced. This point was distinctly ruled in Neal v. Delaware,
and is substantially covered by the decision in Tirginia v.
IRives. If any right, privilege, or immunity of the accused,
secured or guaranteed by the Constitution or laws of the
United States, had been denied by a refusal of the State court
to set aside either that indictment, or the panel of petit jurors,
or by any erroneous ruling in the progress of the trial, his remedy would have been through the revisory power of the highest
court of the State, and ultimately through that of this court.

370.

Oct. 1882.]

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

3. It is also assigned for error that the court of original jurisdiction erred in overruling the motion to set aside the panel
of petit jurors. We have seen that the ground of this motion
was that the petit jurors were not selected and summoned
as required by law, in that all citizens of African descent in
the county, very many of whom were eligible and qualified
to serve as jurors, were excluded from the panel by the officer charged with the duty of selecting and summoning the
petit jurors, and that only white citizens were selected and
summoned.
It is sufficient for this assignment to say that the motion
was properly overruled, for the reason, amongst others, that
the grounds upon which it was rested do not clearly and
distinctly show that the officers who selected and summoned
the petit jurors excluded from the panel qualified citizens of
African descent because of their race or color. It may have
been true that only white citizens were selected and summoned,
yet it would not necessarily follow that the officer had violated the law and the special instruction given by the court "to
proceed in his selection without regard to race, color, or previous condition of servitude." There was no legal right in the
accused to a jury composed in part of his own race. All that
he could rightfully demand was a jury from which his race was
not excluded because of their color. Jirginia v. Rives, 100
U. S. 313. The allegation that colored citizens were excluded,
and that only white citizens were selected, was too vague and
indefinite to constitute the basis of an inquiry by the court
whether the sheriff had not disobeyed its order by selecting
and summoning petit jurors with an intent to discriminate
against the race of the accused. This motion was, therefore,
properly overruled.
4. But the most important question raised by the assignments of error is that which relates to the overruling of the
motion made before the trial to set aside the indictment because found by a grand jury selected and formed upon the
basis of excluding therefrom, because of their color, all citizens
of the African race resident in Fayette County and eligible for
such service.
In several cases heretofore decided in this court we have had

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

[Sup. Ot.

occasion to consider the general question whether the Fourteenth Amendment, and the laws passed by Congress for the
enforcement of its provisions, do not prohibit any discrimination, in the selection of grand and petit jurors, against citizens
of African descent, because of their race or color.
In Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370, we said-commenting
upon Strauder v. West Virginia, Virginia v. Rives, and Ex
parte Virginia, 100 id. 303, 313, 339-that a denial to citizens of African descent, because of their race, of the right or
privilege accorded to white citizens, of participating as jurors
in the administration of justice, is a discrimination against
the former inconsistent with the amendment, and within the
power of Congress, by appropriate legislation, to prevent;
that to compel a colored man to submit to a trial before a jury
drawn from a panel from which is excluded, because of their
color, every man of his race, however well qualified by education and character to discharge the functions of jurors, is a
denial of the equal protection of the laws; and that such exclusion of the black race from juries, because of their color, is
not less forbidden by law than would be the exclusion from
juries, in the States where the blacks have the majority, of the
white race, because of their color.
It was also said, in that case, that "the presumption should
be indulged, in the first instance, that the State recognizes,
as is its plain duty, an amendment of the Federal Constitution,
from the time of its adoption, as binding on all of its citizens
and every department of its government, and to be enforced
within its limits, without reference to any inconsistent provisions in its own Constitution or statutes."
But it was further said: "Had the State, since the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment, passed any statute in conflict
with its provisions, or with the laws enacted for their enforcement, or had its judicial tribunals, by their decisions, repudiated that amendment as a part of the supreme law of the
land, or declared the acts passed to enforce its provisions to
be inoperative and void, there would have been just ground
to hold that there was such a denial, upon its part, of equal
civil rights, or such an inability to enforce them in those
tribunals, as, under the Constitution and within the meaning

Oct. 1882.]

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

of that section (641, Rev. Stat.), would authorize a removal
of the suit or prosecution to the Circuit Court of the United
States."
Again, it was declared that a denial upon the part of the
officers of the State, charged with duties in that regard, of
the right of a colored man "to a selection of grand and petit
jurors without discrimination against his race, because of their
race, would be a violation of the Constitution and laws of the
United States, which the trial court was bound to redress. As
said by us in Virginia v. Rives, ' The court will correct the
wrong, will quash the indictment or the panel; or, if not, the
error will be corrected in a Superior Court,' and ultimately in
this court upon review."
Guided by these principles, we proceed to inquire whether
there was anything in the action of the State, by means of
legislation or otherwise subsequent to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, that requires us to hold, as matter of law,
that in the selection and formation of the grand jury which
returned the last indictment there was such a discrimination
against the plaintiff in error because of his race, as made it
the duty of the court to sustain the motion to set aside that
indictment.
By the Revised Statutes of Kentucky, which went into effect
on the first day of July, 1852, and were in force when the
Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the national Constitution, no one was competent to serve as a petit juror who
was not "a free white citizen;" and none except citizens could
serve on a grand jury. 2 Rev. Stat. Ky. (Stanton's ed.), pp. 75,
77. By the same statutes it was provided that all free white
persons born in Kentucky or in any other State of the Union,
residing in that State, all free white persons naturalized under
the laws of the United States, residing there, and all persons
who have obtained a right to citizenship under former laws,
and every child, wherever born, whose father or mother was or
shall be a citizen of Kentucky at the birth of such child, shall
be deemed citizens of that State. 1 id. 238. So that, by the
law of Kentucky at the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment no citizen of the African race was competent to serve as
a grand juror.

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

[Sup. Ct.

The Revised Statutes of Kentucky were superseded (certainly as to the selection of grand and petit jurors) by the
General Statutes, which were formally enacted as the law of
the State, and went into effect on the first day of December,
1873. These - whilst declaring, in conformity with the Fourteenth Amendment, all persons born or naturalized in the
United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if residing in Kentucky to be citizens of that State - re-enacted the
disqualification of colored persons as petit jurors, and also provided that "no person shall be qualified as a grand juryman
unless he be a white citizen." Gen. Stat. Ky. 570. And in
the new Criminal Code of Practice of Kentucky, which went
into effect Jan. 1, 1877, it is expressly provided that "the
selecting, summoning, and impanelling of a grand jury shall
be as prescribed in the General Statutes." Sect. 101.
It thus appears that the legislature of Kentucky, after the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and notwithstanding
the explicit declaration therein that "no State shall deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws," twice expressly enacted that no citizen of the African
race should be competent to serve either as a grand or petit
juror. And these re-enactments of the prior laws excluding
citizens of that race from service on grand or petit juries remained unchanged by legislation in that Commonwealth until
the passage of the act approved Jan. 26, 1882, whereby the
word "white" was stricken out of the sections of the General Statutes prescribing the qualifications of grand and petit
jurymen.
In this connection it is necessary to recur to the case of
Commonwealth v. Johnson, determined, as we have seen, in the
Court of Appeals of Kentucky on the 29th of June, 1880. In
that case it was held, upon the authority of Strauder v. West
Virginia, 100 U. S. 803 (decided on the first day of March,
1880), that so much of the statute of Kentucky "as excludes
all persons other than white men from service on juries is
unconstitutional, and that no person can be lawfully excluded from any jury on account of his race or color." The
learned court then proceeded: "This question has not been
heretofore passed on by this court, and as the duty of select-

Oct. 1882.]

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

ing and summoning juries is devolved upon merely ministerial
officers, we ought to assume that, in performing their duties,
they obeyed the statute as enacted by the legislature, and that
they excluded colored persons from the jury because the statute declares them to be incompetent, and, consequently, that
the appellee was deprived by the statute of a right which the
Supreme Court holds is secured to him by the Constitution.
"But the word ' white,' as found in our jury laws, being
now declared to be no part of that law, it will be incumbent
on all officers charged with the duty of selecting or summoning
jurors, to make their selections without regard to race or color;
and when juries are hereafter selected and summoned, it ought
to be presumed that the officers did their duty, and ignored
the statute so far as it is herein held to be unconstitutional,
and that they have not excluded any person from the jury on
account of his race or color." 78 Ky. 509.
The indictment upon which the plaintiff in error has been
tried, convicted, and sentenced to suffer death was returned
by a grand jury selected by jury commissioners who were appointed by the State court of original jurisdiction at its May
Term, 1880. It was therefore found by grand jurors who were
selected prior to the decision in Commonwealth v. Johnson.
The names of the grand jurors so selected were reported to the
court at that term as the grand jury for the succeeding term, at which the indictment upon which Bush was tried was returned. So that the grand jurors who found the indictment were
selected when statutes of Kentucky, re-enacted after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, expressly restricted jury
commissioners in their selection of grand jurors to white citizens. Further, they were selected at a time when, according
to the rule announced by the highest court of Kentucky, it
should be assumed that the officers charged with the duty
of selecting grand jurors obeyed the local statute by excluding from the list, because of their race, all citizens of African
descent.
These considerations bring the case within the principles
announced in Xeai
l v. Delaware. The presumption that the
State recognized the Fourteenth Amendment from the date of
its adoption to be binding on all its citizens and every depart-

BUSH V. KENTUCKY.

[Sup. Ct.

ment of its government, and to be enforced within its limits
without reference to any inconsistent provisions in its own
Constitution and laws, is overthrown by the fact that twice,
after the ratification of that amendment, the State enacted
laws which in terms excluded citizens of African descent, because of their race, from service on grand and petit juries. It
was not until after the grand jurors who returned the indictment against Bush had been selected that the highest court of
Kentucky, speaking with authority for all the judicial tribunals
of that Commonwealth, declared that the local statutes, in so
far as they excluded colored citizens from grand and petit
juries because of their race, were in conflict with the national
Constitution.
But upon this branch of the case the argument by counsel
for the Commonwealth of Kentucky is, that the record does
not show, by a bill of exceptions or otherwise, that any proof
whatever was offered in support of the motion to set aside the
indictment; and, consequently, that in disposing of that motion,
as presenting simply a question of law arising upon the face
of the local statutes, the presumption is that the jury commissioners in their selection, at May Term, 1880, of the Fayette
Circuit Court, of grand jurors for the succeeding term, respected the decision in Strauder v. West Virginia and similar
cases, and, therefore, disregarded the statutes of Kentucky.
The force of this position would be greatly strengthened if the
record furnished any evidence that the court gave to those
commissioners such instructions as were given to the sheriff in
May, 1881, when that officer was required to select and summon petit jurors for the trial of Bush. We are of opinion
that the rule announced by the Court of Appeals in Commonwealth v. Johnson is consistent with sound reason and public
policy; and, in conformity therewith,- in the absence of any
evidence that the selection of grand jurors, in May, 1880, was
in fact made without discrimination against colored citizens,
because of their race, - it should be assumed that the jury commissioniers then appointed followed the statutes of Kentucky
so far as they restricted the selections of grand jurors to citizens of the white race.
For these reasons it is adjudged that the court of original

jurisdiction erred in overruling the motion to set aside the
indictment, and, consequently, that the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky erred in affirming its judgment.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, to'be thence

I am unable to concur in this judgment. In my opinion
it is not to be presumed that the courts or the officers of Kentucky neglected or refused to follow the rulings in Strauder v.
West Virginia after the judgment in that case was pronounced
by this court. The Court of Appeals promptly recognized the
authority of that case, and, in the absence of any proof to the
contrary, it seems to me we must assume that the inferior
courts also did.
