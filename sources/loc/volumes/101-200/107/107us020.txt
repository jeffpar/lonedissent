instructions to reverse the decree of the Superior Court within
and for the county of New London, and to direct that court to
render a decree dismissing the bill. It is accordingly
So ordered.

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.
1. By a statute of Missouri, stockholders of a corporation at its dissolution are
liable for its debts; but it is provided that no person holding stock as executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, and no person holding stock as
collateral security, shall be personally subject to such liability, but the persons pledging such stock shall be considered as holding the same, and liable;
and the estates and funds in the hands of executors, &c., shall be liable.
Held, 1. That persons to whom a corporation pledges its stock as collateral
security are within the exemption of the statute. 2. That certificates of
the stock absolute on their face, issued in trust or as collateral security to
a creditor, may be shown to be so held by evidence in pail. 3. That the
person holding such stock in trust, or as collateral security, is not, by his
voting thereon, estopped from showing that it belongs to the company, and
that he holds it as collateral security.
2. The Supreme Court of Missouri, after the Circuit Court had decided this
case, made a contrary decision against the same stockholders, at the suit of
another plaintiff, holding that the clause of exemption in the statute does
not extend to persons receiving from the corporation itself stock as collateral security. Held, that this court is not bound to follow the decision.
3. The courts of the United States, in the administration of State laws in cases
between citizens of different States, have an independent jurisdiction coordinate with that of the State courts, and are bound to exercise their own
judgment as to the meaning and effect of those laws.
4. Where, however, by the course of the decisions of the State courts, certain
rules are established which become rules of property and action in the
State, and have all the effect of law,- especially with regard to the law of
real estate and the construction of State constitutions and statutes, - the
courts of the United States always regard such rules as authoritative declarations of what the law is. But where the law has not been thus settled,
it is their right and duty to exercise their own judgment; as they also
always do in reference to the doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence: and when contracts and transactions have been entered into
and rights have accrued thereon under a particular state of the decisions
of the State tribunals, or when there has been no decision, the courts of the
United States assert the right to adopt their own interpretation of the law
applicable to the case, although a different interpretation may be given by
the State courts after such rights have accrued.

5. But even in such cases, for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the
courts of the United States will lean towards an agreement of views with
the State courts, if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.
6. Acting on these principles of comity, the courts of the United States, without
sacrificing their own dignity as independent tribunals, endeavor to avoid,
and in most cases do avoid, any unseemly conflict with the well-considered
decisions of the State courts.
7. As, however, the very object of giving to the national courts jurisdiction to
administer the laws of the States in controversies between citizens of different States was to institute independent tribunals which it might be supposed would be unaffected by local prejudices and sectional views, it is
their duty to exercise an independent judgment in cases not foreclosed by
previous adjudication.
8. A judgment entered by consent for a specific amount, subject to any credits
which the defendant may produce vouchers for, is good as between the
parties themselves and their privies.

delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action brought by the plaintiff, Burgess, against
J. & W. Seligman & Co., as stockholders of the Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company, under a statute of
the State of Missouri to recover a debt due to him by the company. The plaintiff, in his petition, alleges that on the 5th of
November, 1874, judgment was rendered in his favor against
the corporation by the District Court of Cherokee County,
Kansas, for $73,661, which remains unsatisfied; that in December, 1874, the corporation was dissolved; and that the
defendants, at the date of the dissolution and of the judgment,
were, and still are, stockholders of the corporation to the
amount of $6,000,000, on which there is due and unpaid
$1,000,000; and he demands judgment for the amount of his
debt. Joseph Seligman, the principal defendant, answered,
denying that the defendants were ever stockholders, or subscribers to the stock, of the corporation, and setting forth cerMR. JUSTICE BRADLEY

tain facts and circumstances (stated in the findings) under
which the stock alleged to be theirs was merely deposited in
their hands by the corporation in trust for a temporary purpose by way of collateral security, to be returned when that
purpose was accomplished.
The cause was tried by the court, and judgment was rendered for the defendants on certain findings of fact; and the
question here is, whether the facts as found are sufficient to
support the judgment.
The principal facts upQn which the case must turn are substantially the following: The Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company was a corporation organized under the general laws of
Missouri, with an authorized capital of $10,000,000. On the
10th of March, 1872, a contract in writing was entered into
between the corporation and J. & W. Seligman & Co. (the defendants), which is set forth in the findings. In the recitals of
this contract it was stated that certain municipal subscriptions,
in the shape of bonds, to the amount of $645,000, had been
obtained in aid of its construction; and that a portion of the
road (27 miles) was already graded, bridged, and tied, and the
right of way obtained, and all paid for by the proceeds of said
subscriptions, and that the company now sought additional capital for procuring iron and equipment for the road by the sale
of its first-mortgage bonds: it was, therefore, agreed that the
railroad company should furnish the capital necessary to completely prepare the road for the iron, and would execute and
deposit with the defendants their entire issue of first-mortgage
bonds, to wit, $5,000,000, and a majority of their capital stock
authorized to be issued, "said stock to remain in the control of
said party of the second part [J. & W. Seligman & Co.] for
the term of one year at least." The latter agreed to purchase
two thousand tons of railroad iron under the railroad company's direction, and from time to time to make advances of
cash during the completion of the road, not exceeding $200,000
(including the amount paid for iron), and to receive interest
thereon at the rate of seven per cent per annum until reimbursed by sale of the bonds. They were to have the privilege
for the term of twelve months of calling any portion of the

Oct. 1882.]

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

$5,000,000 of bonds at the rate of seventy cents currency and
accrued interest less two and a half per cent, and if more bonds
were sold than enough to iron the road, they should advance
funds to purchase rolling-stock $2,000 per mile, the balance to
remain with them on deposit on interest at the rate of call
loans to pay any deficiency in net earnings of the road to meet
demands for interest on the bonds. If the bonds, or part of
them, could not, for any unforeseen cause, be negotiated during
the next twelve months, the company were to repay to J. & W.
Seligman & Co. all moneys advanced by them with interest at
the rate of seven per cent per annum and a commission of two
and a half per cent on all bonds returnied. This is the purport
of the written agreement.
On the 1st of May, 1872, a trust deed was executed by the
company on its railroad and appurtenances to Jesse Seligman
and John 11. Stewart, trustees, to secure the company's bonds.
On the 11th of May, 1872, the following resolution of the directors was passed: "It is ordered lty the board of directors
that in making negotiations for money with J. & W. Seligman
& Co., certificates for a majority of the capital stock of this
company be issued to the said J. & W. Seligman & Co., to hold
in trust for the period of twelve months, and that such certificates be signed by the president and secretary, with the corporate seal of this company affixed." A stock certificate for sixty
thousand shares, or $6,000,000, was accordingly issued in the
usual form to J. & W. Seligman & Co. This certificate was
delivered to the defendants, but the court finds that they never
subscribed for the stock, nor agreed to do so, and obtained it
only in the manner set forth. The list of stockholders on the
stock-book of the company, required by law to be kept, contains the names of certain townships which contributed aid to
the road, and several individuals, including J. & W. Seligman,
but not the amount of shares held. The stock transfer-book
(also required by law) contained the same list, with date,
number of shares, and amount carried out opposite to each
name. The name of J. & W. Seligman appeared therein as
follows : -

(held in escrow).

The court further found that shortly after the contract of
March 14, 1872, Joseph Shippen, an attorney, of St. Louis,
saw and examined its provisions, and a few days after told
Burgess (the plaintiff) of the contract, and that thereby the
Seligmans were to have control of the road and of the stock
and bonds, and told Burgess it would be well for him to have
a talk with Joseph Seligman before entering into contract
with the railroad for its construction. Burgess accordingly
saw Seligman, and testifies that the following conversation
ensued "I told him I had been constructing on that Carthage road,
and that I understood he was interested in the road now, and
I would like to talk to him on that matter; that this company
owed me - or Cunningham, who was the president of the corporation - that he owed me then some money for work I had
done between there and Pierce City, and I wanted to know
what the prospect was for pushing the work forwal-d, the
means of getting the iron, and so on, and he said: ' I think the
best thing you can do is to go on with the work westward, and
we will have ample means to get hold of the local bonds.' It
seems Cunningham had represented to him that there was
local means enough to grade the road, and he suggested to me
then that I would be safe in going on and entering into such a
contract, and then he mentioned that he thought it would be
better for all parties if the road was built and the work prosecuted westward."
Afterwards, on June 14, 1872, Burgess entered into a contract
with the railroad company for the construction of the road
from Carthage, Mo., to Independence, Kansas. He immediately began work under the contract, and so continued until
the fall of 1878.
The bonds of the company to the amount of $864,000 were
issued, and were negotiated and sold by J. & W. Seligman

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

& Co., they themselves becoming holders of over $400,000
thereof.
The stock issued to them was voted on by proxy at two successive annual meetings for election of directors.
The company being unable to meet its interest on the bonds,
the road and property were delivered to the trustees of the
mortgage and sold in December, 1874, and Joseph Seligman
and *Josiah Macy, as a bondholder's committee, became purchasers thereof, and the railroad corporation was dissolved in
conformity with the laws of Missouri about the same time.
On the 5th of November, 1874, Burgess obtained judgment
in the District Court of Cherokee County, Kansas, against the
railroad corporation, for work and materials under his contract,
for the sum of $73,661, which judgment recited that it was
entered by agreement, with a stipulation that it would be entitled to a credit of the amount which had been paid by the
railroad company to sub-contractors and laborers of the plaintiff, when the exact amount thereof should have been ascertained and proper vouchers furnished. No credits, however,
were claimed. The present action was brought to recover the
amount of this judgment.
The findings also set out the contract made by Burgess and
his associate with the railroad company, 14th June, 1872, for
constructing the road, by which it appeared that they agreed
to take their pay in township bonds, so far as the same should
be furnished.
Upon these facts the court gave judgment in favor of the
defendants. Burgess brings the case here by writ of error.
The statutory provision upon which the action is founded is
the twenty-second section of article 1 of the act of Missouri
relating to private corporations, which declares as follows: "If
any company, formed under this act, dissolve, leaving debts
unpaid, suits may be brought against any person or persons
who were stockholders at the time of such dissolution without joining the company in such suit, and if judgment be rendered and execution satisfied, the defendant or defendants may
sue all who were stockholders at the time of dissolution for
the recovery of the portion of such debt for which they were
liable." 1 Wagner's Statutes, c. 37.

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

[Sup. t

By sect. 9 of art. 2 of the same chapter, it is enacted as follows: "No person holding stock in any such company as
executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, and no person
holding such stock as collateral security, shall be personally
subject to any liability as a stockholder of such company, but
the person pledging such stock shall be considered as holding the
same, and shall be liable as a stockholder accordingly, and
the estates and funds in the hands of such executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee shall be liable, in like manner and
to the same extent, as the testator or intestate, or the ward or
person interested in such fund, would have been if he had been
living and competent to act, and held the stock in his own
name."
The first question for consideration is whether the plaintiff's
claim was established. He relied on the judgment recovered
by him against the corporation in Kansas. It is contended by
the defendants that this judgment does not establish any debt
due to the plaintiff. But we think that the objection is not
sound. The judgment, as against the corporation and its
privies, does establish the debt named therein as due to the
plaintiff, but subject to a defeasance for such an amount as
might be shown to have been paid to sub-contractors and
laborers by the corporation. The defendants, as well as the
corporation, were at liberty to show any credits which, by the
stipulation, were properly applicable in reduction of the amount
of the judgment. None such were shown, or attempted to be
shown. Until such credits were shown the judgment stood
valid for the whole amount. It was not for the plaintiff, but
for the defendants, to show that any such credits existed.
The next and principal question is, whether J. & W. Seligman & Co., or J. & W. Seligman, were stockholders of the
Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company,
within the meaning of the law. Did the sixty thousand shares
of stock belong to them? or did they hold it by way of trust or
as collateral security for the fulfilment of the company's obligations in relation to the bonds? The courts in England, and
some in this country, have gone very far in sustaining a liability for unpaid subscriptions to stock against persons holding
the same in any capacity whatever, whether as trustees, guar-

Oct. 1882.]

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

dians, or executors, or merely as collateral security. It cannot
be denied that, in some cases, the extreme length to which the
doctrine has been pushed has operated very harshly; and in
cases in which the corporation itself has no just right to enforce payment, and where no bad faith or fraudulent intent has
intervened, it may be doubted whether creditors have any better
right, unless by force or some express provision of a statute.
The Missouri statute recognizes the justice of making a discrimination between those who hold stock in their own right,
and those who hold it merely in a representative capacity, or as
trustees, or by way of collateral security.
Upon a careful examination of the facts found in this case we
do not see how a reasonable doubt can exist, that the Seligmans
held the stock in question as trustees and custodians by way of
collateral security for themselves and the purchasers of the
bonds. That was clearly the intent of the parties, declared in
almost so many words; and that intent must prevail unless, by
some inadvertency in carrying it out, the Seligmans have been
unwittingly caught in some legal snare of which the creditors
can take advantage. By the contract executed between them
and the corporation they were to act as its financial agents in
the disposal of its bonds, and to make advances of money from
time to time to enable the company to get the necessary -iron
for completing its road and equipment for running it. The
company were to prepare the superstructure and procure the
ties and everything necessary by way of preparation for laying
the iron down; and was to do this by means of the resources it
had already secured, and. expected to obtain, from the township subscriptions, in order that the mortgage to be given as
security for the bonds might be good and valid for that purpose; and the company further agreed to deposit with Seligman & Co. a majority of *its capital stock, to remain in their
control for the term of one year at least. The reasonable inference is, that this deposit of stock was to be made for the
purpose alleged in the defendant's answer, namely, as security
for the payment of the bonds, and to enable Seligman & Co.
to control the corporation and see that its affairs were honestly
conducted and the earnings properly applied. The resolution
of the directors, adopted for carrying out this agreement, is to

BURGESS V. SELIGIAN.

[Sup. Ot.

the same purport and effect: it directs that, in making negotiations for money with Seligman & Co., certificates for a majority of the capital stock should be issued to them to hold in trust
for the period of twelve months; and when the stock was entered upon the transfer-book in the name of J. & W. Seligman,
it was characterized as being "held in escrow."
The terms used may not have been strictly technical. The
issuing of the stock in their names may not have been a "deposit " or an "escrow" in the strict sense of those words; but the
intent is very clear, that the stock was not to be regarded as
their stock, but as belonging to the company, though in their
names, and that it was to be held by them simply as a security.
They never subscribed for the stock, they never became indebted to the company for it, the company never acquired any
right to demand from them a single dollar on account of it.
Though issued in form, it was only issued in a qualified sense,
to subserve a specific purpose by way of collateral security for
a limited period, and was returnable to the company when that
purpose should be accomplished. It seems to us that te Seligmans, in taking and holding the stock, held it merely in trust
by way of collateral security for themselves and others, and
that they were therefore within the express exception made
by the law in favor of those holding stock in that way.
It is urged, however, that they are estopped from claiming
the benefit of this exemption by their conduct in being represented and voting at stockholders' meetings. But if the law
allows stock to be held in trust, or as collateral security, without personal liability; and if, as we suppose, the clear effect of
the contract was to create such a holding in this case, - we do
not see how the doctrine of estoppel can apply. The only
parties to -complain would be the other stockholders, who
might, perhaps, complain that stock held merely in trust, or as
collateral security, is not entitled to participate with them in
the privilege of voting. But from them no complaint is heard.
Creditors could not complain, for, on the hypothesis that stock
may lawfully be held at all in trust, or as collateral security,
without incurring liability to them, the act of voting on the
stock cannot injure or affect them. In the absence of such a
law the case might be very different. Undoubtedly it has

Oct. 1882.]

BURGESS V. SELIGMIAN.

been held in cases innumerable, that acting as a stockholder
binds one as such; but that is where the law does not allow
stock to be held at all without incurring all the liabilities incident to such holding. The present is an action at law based
upon the supposed liability of the defendants under a statute
which makes the distinction referred to, and which does not
make all stockholders liable indiscriminately. We think that
this makes a material difference. If the defendants can show,
as we think they have shown, that they are within the exception of the statute, the statutory liability does not apply to
them.
It is by no means clear, however, that J. & W. Seligman did
not have a right to vote on the stock, even as against the
stockholders. When the law provides that if a person holds
stock as a trustee, or by way of collateral security only, he
shall not be personally liable for the company's debts, it supposes that the stock shall be holden, and that the pledgee or
trustee shall be the holder. If, then, the law is to have any
force or effect, the mere fact of holding cannot be set up as a
bar or estoppel against proof of the manner and character of
such holding. And if such pledgee or trustee may be a holder
of the stock in that character, is he bound to be perfectly passive in his holding? He will not be entitled to any dividends
or profits, it is true ; or, if he receives dividends or profits, he
must account therefor; but is it certain that he may not lawfally vote on the stock? An executor, administrator, guardian,
or trustee certainly may vote; and where is the rule to be
found that a holder for collateral security, under a law which
permits such holding, may not vote on the stock so held without losing his character as a mere pledgee? But, as before
said, if the pledgee in voting the stock exceeds his rights as
such pledgee, it cannot have the effect of making the stock his
own. No one is injured, and no one can complain except the
other stockholders whose rights are invaded.
The line of authorities usually quoted to show that those who
actually hold stock, and who- manifest a voluntary or intentional holding by voting on it, or receiving dividends or other
benefit from it, consists mainly of cases in which parties have
been held as corporators or associates as between themselves

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

[Sup. OL.

and the corporation or joint-stock association, and as such
incidentally liable to the creditors of such companies. Sir
Nathaniel Lindley, in his able treatise on Partnership, has
amply discussed the whole subject upon the platform of the
English decisions. His fundamental proposition is this : "The
type, then, of a member or shareholder of a company is a person who has agreed to become a member, and with respect to
whom all conditions precedent to the acquisition of the rights
of a member have been duly observed. . . . In practice, difficulties are only presented where this standard is not reached;
and the important question really is to what extent it can be
departed from, and membership be nevertheless constituted."
Vol. i. p. 128. He then devotes many pages to show, by
adjudged cases, how a man may be held as a corporator by the
company itself, by holding himself out as such, as by taking
dividends, &c. Now, in the present case the relation of J. &
W. Seligman & Co. to the corporation is expressly settled and
fixed by the written contract between them. We have already
examined that contract, and have shown that the stock issued
by the corporation to J. & W. Seligman & Co. was issued to
them only as trustees and by way of collateral security. The
proposition that the corporation could hold them as subscribers
to its stock would be in fiat defiance of the contract in whole
and in every part. We do not know of any iron rule of law
which would prevent them from showing this contract relation
between them and the company. It is the origin and foundation of their whole connection with it. The sufficiency of the
evidence to control their status towards the company is another
thing. Its competency seems to us free from doubt. When
examined it shows, as before stated, that as between them and
the company the latter has no claim whatever against them in
relation to the stock except to have it returned when properly
required, after the purpose of its issue had been accomplished.
It belongs to the company, and to it alone. J. & W. Seligman
are mere trustees or custodians of it for a special purpose, that
purpose being collateral security.
In this connection we may properly refer to the decision of
the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the case of .Tfatthews
v. Albert, 24 Md. 527, which was a case arising upon the

Oct. 1882.]

BURGESS V. SELIGMtfAN.

Maryland statute from which that of Missouri was copied so far
as relates to the exception of those holding stock in trust or as
collateral security. That was a suit in equity brought against
stockholders to render them liable for the company's debts.
One of them, by the name of Tieman, had loaned money to
the corporation, and, as security for its payment, a certificate of
stock had been issued to him. After its issue an indorsement
was made on it by the president of the corporation to the effect
that it had been deposited with Tieman as collateral security
for the loan. The court said: "The claim of W. H. Tieman is for $2,000, money alleged
to be loaned to the company on the 8th of January, 1859.
But it is insisted by the appellees, that Tieman, instead of
being a non-stockholding creditor, is, according to the evidence,
a stockholder, and as much liable as the Alberts. We do not
concur in this view of the relation of Tieman to the company.
In our opinion, his claim is for money loaned; and the stock
transferred to him was held by him as collateral security for
his loan, and so holding it, he is not personally subject to any
liability as stockholder, but is protected by the provision of the
twelfth section of the act of 1852, c. 838."
A similar decision in a case arising upon a like statute in
New York was made by the Commissioners of Appeal of that
State in HfcAlfahon v. .aacy, 51 N. Y. 155. The New York
railroad act of 1850, as amended by the act of 1854, made
stockholders liable to creditors of the company for the amount
unpaid on their stock; but the eleventh section of the act
contained precisely the same provision as that in the ninth
section of the Missouri law, that no person holding stock as
executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, and no person holding stock as collateral security, should be personally subject to
any liability as stockholders, imposing the liability, however,
as the Missouri law does, on the pledgor or cestui que trust.
Macy was sued as a stockholder, and it was shown on the trial
that the stock held by him was transferred to him as collateral
security, The referee refused to give any effect to this evidence, holding that parol evidence could not be received to
contradict or vary the written assignments or transfers, which
were absolute in form. The Commissioners of Appeal, on this

BURGESS V. SELTGMAN.

[Sup. Ot.

branch of the case, said: "In this he erred. It is always
competent to show that an assignment or conveyance absolute
in form was only intended as a security. There is nothing in
any statute which makes the books of the company incontrovertible evidence of ownership of stock. A person may be the
absolute legal and equitable owner of stock without any transfer appearing upon the books." All the judges of the commission concurred in this opinion.
We do not well see how any different conclusion could
logically have been arrived at. If the law declares that stock
held as collateral security shall not make the holder liable,
surely it must be competent to show that it is so held. And
when this fact is once established, there is an end of the application of estoppel, unless it can be invoked by some party who
has been specially misled by the conduct of the defendants.
It is urged by the plaintiff, in this case, that the defendants
are estopped as to him, because of a certain conversation between Joseph Seligman and himself before he entered into the
contract for construction. We have carefully examined the
account given of this conversation by the plaintiff himself, and
we see nothing in it which at all compromits the defendants on
the question of their actual status and position in the affairs of
the company. Especially may this be said in view of the fact
that, prior to that conversation, an attorney, who had inspected
the contract of Seligmans & Co., told him of it, and that it
would be well for him to have a talk with Joseph Seligman
before entering into contract with the railroad company for its
construction. The general purport of the conversation which
he afterwards had with Seligman was, that Seligman advised
him to take the contract and go on with the work, as the best
thing for all parties, as there would be ample means to get
hold of the local bonds, which would be sufficient to grade the
road. Surely there was nothing in this conversation to estop
the defendants from showing what their real position was with
regard to the stock which they held.
But the appellant's counsel, with much confidence, press
upon our attention the decisions of the Supreme Court of Missouri on the questions involved in this case, and on the very
transactions which we are considering. That court, since the

Oct. 1882.]

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

determination of this case by the Circuit Court, has given
judgment in two cases adversely to the judgment in this, and
to the views above expressed. The first case was that of G-iswold v. Seligman, decided in November, 1880; the other, that
of Tisher v. Seligman, decided in February, 1882, in which the
former case was substantially followed and confirmed. The
case of Griswold v. Seligman seems to have been very fully
and carefully considered. We have read the opinion of the
court and the dissenting opinion of one of the judges with much
attention, but we are unable to come to the conclusion reached
by the majority.
We do not consider ourselves bound to follow the decision of
the State court in this case. When the transactions in controversy occurred, and when the case was under the consideration
of the Circuit Court, no construction of the statute had been
given by the State tribunals contrary to that given by the Circuit Court. The Federal courts have an independent jurisdiction in the administration of State laws, co-ordinate with, and
not subordinate to, that of the State courts, and are bound to
exercise their own judgment as to the meaning and effect of
those laws. The existence of two co-ordinate jurisdictions in
the same territory is peculiar, and the results would be anomalous and inconvenient but for the exercise of mutual respect
and deference. Since th ordinary administration of the law
is carried on by the State courts, it necessarily happens that by
the course of their decisions certain rules are established which
become rules of property and action in the State, and have all
the effect of law, and which it would be wrong to disturb.
This is especially true with regard to the law of real estate and
the construction of State constitutions and statutes. Such established rules are always regarded by the Federal courts, no
less than by the State courts themselves, as authoritative declarations of what the law is. But where the law has not been
thus settled, it is the right and duty of the Federal courts to
exercise their own judgment; as they also always do in reference to the doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudeuce. So when contracts and transactions have been entered
into, and rights have accrued thereon under a particular state
of the decisions, or when there has been no decision, of the

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

[Sup. Ct.

State tribunals, the Federal courts properly claim the right to
adopt their own interpretation of the law applicable to the case,
although a different interpretation may be adopted by the
State courts after such rights have accrued. But even in such
cases, for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the Federal courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the
State courts if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.
Acting on these principles, founded as they are on comity and
good sense, the courts of the United States, without sacrificing
their own dignity as independent tribunals, endeavor to avoid,
and in most cases do avoid, any unseemly conflict with the
well-considered decisions of the State courts. As, however,
the very object of giving to the national courts jurisdiction to
administer the laws of the States in controversies between citizens of different States was to institute independent tribunals
which it might be supposed would be unaffected by local prejudices and sectional views, it would be a dereliction of their
duty not to exercise an independent judgment in cases not
foreclosed by previous adjudication. As this matter has received our special consideration, we have endeavored thus
briefly to state our views with distinctness, in order to obviate
any misapprehensions that may arise from language and expressions used in previous decisions. The principal cases
bearing upon the subject are referred 4to in the note, but it is
not deemed necessary to discuss them in detail. 1

BURGESS v. SELIGMAN.

In the present case, as already observed, when the transactions in question took place, and when the decision of the Circuit
Court was rendered, not only was there no settled construction
of the statute on the point under consideration, but the Missouri cases referred to arose upon the identical transactions
which the Circuit Court was called upon, and which we are
now called upon, to consider. It can hardly be contended that
the Federal court was to wait for the State courts to decide the
merits of the controversy and then simply register their decision ; or that the judgment of the Circuit Court should be
reversed merely because the State court has since adopted a
different view. If we could see fair and reasonable ground to
acquiesce in that view, we should gladly do so; but in the exercise of that independent judgment which it is our duty to
apply to the case, we are forced to a different conclusion.
Pea8e v. Peckc, 18 How. 595, and llorgan v. Curtenius, 20 id. 1,
in which the opinions of the court were delivered by Mr. Justice Grier, are precisely in point.
The cardinal position assumed by the State court is, that
inasmuch as certificates of stock were in fact issued to, and
accepted by, J. & W. Seligman, and they voted on the stock,
they are absolutely estopped from denying that they are the
owners of the stock, subject to all the liabilities incident to
that relation; and that they cannot have the benefit of the exception accorded by the law to those who hold stock as collateral security, because, as the court holds, that exemption only
applies to those who have received stock in that way from some
stockholder who can be made liable as a stockholder, and not
to those who have received stock from the corporation itself by
way of collateral security.
The first position, that the acceptance of the stock, and voting upon it, absolutely precluded the defendants from denying
that they are owners of the stock, has been already considered.

BURGESS v. SELIGMAN.

[Sup. Ot.

The great mass of authorities relied on by the Supreme
Court of Missouri, on this part of the case, English as well as
American, are cases in which parties have been held as corporators or associates as between themselves and the corporation,
and upon that footing have been held responsible to creditors
when the rights of creditors have been in question. We think
that we have sufficiently shown that these authorities cannot
govern the case in hand if any effect is to be given to the law
of Missouri, exempting from personal liability those who hold
stock in a fiduciary character or by way of collateral security.
We will, therefore, briefly examine the other position, that this
law does not apply to those who receive stock as collateral security from the corporation itself.
The argument that the exemption from liability in cases of
stock held as collateral security, applies only to those who have
received it from third persons who were stockholders and who
can be proceeded against as such, seems to us unsound, and
contrary both to the words and the reason of the law. It takes
for granted that stock cannot be received as collateral security
from the corporation itself and still belong to the corporation,
and yet we know that such transactions are very common in
the business of this country. The words of the statute are
positive, and relate to all holders of stock for collateral security. They are as follows :,,No person holding stock in any
such company as executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee,
and no person holding such stock as collateral security, shall be
personally subject to any liability as stockholder of such corn!
pany." The reason of this law is derived fr-om the gross injustice of making a person liable as the owner of stock when he
only holds it in trust or by way of security, and from the inexpediency of putting a clog upon this species of property, which
will have the effect of making it unavailable to the owner, or of
deterring prudent and responsible men from accepting positions
of trust where any such property is concerned. It seems to us
that not only the law, but the reason upon which it is founded,
applies to the holders of stock as collateral security, whether
received from an individual or from the corporation itself. It
is argued, however, that the remaining words of the law are
repugnant to this view. These words are as follows: " But

BURGESS V. SELIGMAN.

•the person pledging such stock shall be considered as holding
the same, and shall be liable as a stockholder accordingly, and
the estates and funds in the hands of such executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee shall be liable, in like manner and
to the same extent, as the testator or intestate, or the ward or
person interested in such fund, would have been if he had been
living and competent to act, and held the stock in his own
name." The argument is, that these words imply that there
must always be some person or estate to respond for the stock,
or else the exemption cannot take effect. The obvious answer
is, that this clause fixes the liability upon the pledgor as a
stockholder, where there is a pledgor who can be made liable
in that character. When the corporation pledges its own
stock as collateral security, though it cannot be proceeded
against as a stockholder eo nomine, the reason is because it is
primarily liable, before all stockholders, for all its debts. In
such a case the clause last quoted would not strictly apply to
it; but the holder of its stock as collateral security would be
within both the letter and the spirit of the first clause. It is
supposed that some flagrant injustice would ensue if there was
not some one who could be reached as a stockholder in every
case of stock pledged as collateral security; hence, stock
pledged by the corporation itself must be regarded as belonging
to the pledgee, though no other pledgee of stock is treated in
this way. Where is the justice of this? Why should the
stock be necessarily considered as belonging to some one besides the corporation itself ? Is any one harmed by considering
the corporation as its true owner? If the stock had not been
issued as collateral security, it would not have been issued at
all; it would not have been in existence. Would the creditors
have been any better off in such case? They are better
off by the issue of the stock as collateral, because the general assets of the company have received the benefit of the
moneys obtained by means of the pledge. The more closely
the matter is examined, the more unreasonable it seems to
deny to a pledgee of the corporation the same exemption which
is extended to the pledgee of third persons. We think that
the one equally with the other is protected by the express words
and true spirit of the law.

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ct.

We might pursue the subject further, and examine in detail.
the suggestions and authorities adduced by the learned court
which decided the case of Griswold v. Seligman and Pisher v.
Seligman; but it is unnecessary. What we have said is sufficient to indicate substantially the grounds on which we feel
obliged to dissent from its conclusions. In our judgment the
facts found by the court below make out a clear case of stock
held in trust and by way of collateral security only, and the
judgment rendered thereon was correct.
Judgment affirmed.

TURNER v. MARYLAND.
1.Section 41 of chapter 346 of the laws of Maryland of 1864, as amended and reenacted by chapter 291 of the laws of 1870, provides as follows: "After the
passage of this act, it shall not be lawful to carry out of this State, in hogsheads, any tobacco raised in this State, except in hogsheads which shall have
been inspected, passed, and marked agreeably to the provisions of this act,
unless such tobacco shall have been inspected and passed before this act goes
into operation; and any person violating the provisions of this section shall
forfeit and pay the sum of three hundred dollars, which may be recovered
in any court of law of this State, and which shall go to the credit of the tobacco fund: Provided,that nothing herein contained shall be construed to
prohibit any grower of tobacco, or any purchaser thereof, who may pack
the same in the county or neighborhood where grown, from exporting or
carrying out of this State any such tobacco without having the same opened
for inspection; but such tobacco so exported or carried out of this State
without inspection shall in all cases be marked with the name in full of the
owner thereof, and the place of residence of such owner, and shall be liable
to the same charge of outage and storage as in other cases, and any person
who shall carry or send out of this State any such tobacco, without having
it so marked, shall be subject to the penalty prescribed by this section."
Under that proviso, no requirement of the act of 1864 is dispensed with, except that of having the hogshead opened for inspection. The hogshead
must still be delivered at a State tobacco warehouse, and there numbered
and recorded and weighed and marked, and be found to be of the dimensions prescribed by statute, and to have been packed and marked as required. Held, 1. That said section 41, as so amended and re-enacted, is
not, in its provisions as to charges for outage and storage, in violation of
clause 2 of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States,
as respects any impost or duty imposed by it on exports, or of the clause of
section 8 of article 1 which gives power to the Congress "to regulate com.
merce with foreign nations and among the several States;" nor is it a regu-
