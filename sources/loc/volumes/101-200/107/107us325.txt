p. 450. This clearly implies that if a suit could be brought
on the note, it could for the foreclosure of the mortgage, should
there be no other objection to the jurisdiction than the citizenship of the payee and maker.
In the Judiciary Act of 1789 it was expressly provided that
the Circuit Courts could not take cognizance of a suit to recover the contents of any promissory note or other chose in
action in favor of an assignee, unless a suit might have been
prosecuted in such court to recover the contents, if no assignment had been made, except in cases of foreign bills of exchange. The act of 1875, however, removes this restriction
in suits on "promissory notes negotiable by the law merchant; " and now the jurisdiction in such suits is made to depend on the citizenship of the parties, as in other cases.
Since, therefore, the indorsee could have sued in the Circuit
Court on the note now in question, it follows that, as there is
no objection to the jurisdiction other than the citizenship of
the original payee, the suit to foreclose the mortgage was
properly brought.

1. Unless objected to within a reasonable time,-and what constitutes such a
reasonable time is a question of law,-an account rendered becomes an
account stated, and cannot be impeached except for fraud or mistake.
2. A witness was, on cross-examination, asked if he had not stated to different
parties that he wished the plaintiffs to recover, as he would then get his
pay. An objection to the question was made, and the defendant's counsel
then declared that he did not propose to impeach the witness. ield, that
the objection was properly sustained.

of advances to A. under his contract; but the inspection and final count
was to be made by an inspector appointed by B. at a point to which the
latter shipped them. The property in the headings was to pass to B. on

evidence of the counts by both parties of the whole number of single pieces of
heading, and submitting to the jury the comparison between them, the court
having ruled that the inspector's final count, which formed the basis of an
estimate and average from which the number of matched headings was deduced, was, if made fairly and in the exercise of his best judgment, binding
on the parties, unless its variance from the actual truth was too great to
be accounted for by mere error of judgment in the matter of matching.
2. That although there was no evidence to show that all the pieces of
heading shipped were in fact delivered at the point to which they had been
sent, the jury were not bound to assume a loss in transportation in order to
account for the discrepancy between the two counts.

ERRoR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Michigan.
The case is stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Levi T. Griffin and Hr. Don H. Di'Aeinson for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. Harrison Geer and Mr. Walter I. Smith, with whom
was Mr. Michael -E. Crofoot, for the defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the court.
This action was originally brought in the State Circuit
Court for the County of Genessee, in Michigan, and removed
by the plaintiff in error, who was defendant below, into the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of
Michigan. The defendant in error sued as assignee of Merritt
& iHelme, partners as J. J. Merritt & Co., who were assignees
of J. J. Merritt, upon a certain contract entered into between
him and the Standard Oil Company, and subsequent modifications thereof, to recover a balance alleged to be due thereon on
account of the price of certain headings for oil-barrels sold and
delivered in pursuance thereof.
By the original contract, dated Oct. 4, 1873, Merritt, described as of Lapeer, Michigan, sold the Standard Oil Company two million heading suitable for oil-barrels, to be sawed
twenty-two inches in length, full one inch thick on sap, and
full one-half inch thick on the heart edge, and whenever more
than two pieces are required to make a head the same shall be
counted as two; to be delivered on board the cars at Cleveland,
Ohio, on or before March 1, 1875, subject to the count and inspection of the Standard Oil Company, who agreed to receive

Oct. 1882.]

OIL CO. v. VAN ETTEN.

and pay for the same as fast as inspected at the price of forty
dollars per thousand. Merritt also agreed that full one-half of
the whole amount of the heading should saw full two-pieced
heading, and the Standard Oil Company agreed in that case,
and if the other half were not more than three-pieced heading,
they would pay an additional dollar per thousand on the whole
amount. It was further agreed that Merritt should have the
privilege of drawing, on sight drafts, for twenty-five dollars per
thousand, through the bank, accompanied by duplicate bill of
lading signed by the railroad company, as evidence of shipment,
and that the cars should be so loaded as to have a net value in
Cleveland of amount of draft after culling and paying freight.
This contract was modified by a supplemental agreement of
April 1, 1874, Helme then becoming a party to it, by which it
was stipulated that Merritt & Co. should make and deliver the
heading, properly piled on land in Lapeer controlled by the
Standard Oil Company; the latter to furnish a man to count
the heading as nearly as might be from week to week as piled,
but not to inspect it, the object of the count being to obtain an
approximate estimate of the heading thus piled, in order to determine from time to time the amount of advances to be made
thereon; but thereupon the delivery of the heading so counted
should be deemed complete, and the heading should then become
the property of the Standard Oil Company absolutely, Merritt
& Co. being entitled to draw upon certificates of such counts at
the rate of twenty dollars per thousand, on which advances the
Oil Company were to be allowed interest at the rate of ten per
cent per annum until the heading should be received at Cleveland, and also to charge the cost of insurance thereon to the
amount of twenty-one dollars per thousand, the loss by fire, if
any, above that amount to be borne by Merritt & Co. In
all other respects the terms of the original contract were to
govern.
On May 29, 1874, another modification of the contract was
made, which recited that, "through an error made by the inspector employed by said Standard Oil Company, the said 5. J.
Merritt & Co. have received from the said Standard Oil Company money in excess of the amount" which under the contract they were entitled to receive, amounting to about $2,500,

328

OIL Co. V.VAN ErTnN.

[Sup. Ct.

and made certain provisions as to the time and mode in which
it should be refunded, but otherwise left the contract unchanged.
On Aug. 24, 1874, a further modification was agreed to, increasing the amount of the advances to twenty-five dollars per
thousand on the second million of the heading.
The heading was manufactured mostly in 1874, and was piled
on each side of the railroad track, upon land leased for that
purpose by the defendant below, and shipments begun in May,
1875.
Testimony on the part of the plaintiff below was offered and
admitted to show that in loading an accurate account was made
and kept of each car loaded, of the number of the car, the line
to which it belonged, and the number of pieces in each car,
and that there were 891 car-loads, containing in all 2,691,660
single pieces.
After the first four car-loads had been shipped through by
rail, an arrangement was made between the parties by which
the rest of the heading was to be sent by rail from Lapeer to
Detroit, a distance of sixty miles, and thence by vessel to
Cleveland. These first four car-loads by rail and the first cargo
by vessel were counted and inspected by the defendant below
at Cleveland, and returns of the result made to Merritt & Co.
These returns showed the number of matched headings and the
number of single pieces rejected, on inspection, as deficient in
size and quality, called "culls;" and it appearing that these
were but a small portion of the whole, it was then agreed that
if Merritt & Co. would cull before shipment as closely as they
had done in these shipments, the defendant would not cull any
more at Cleveland, but would merely match and count the
matched heads.
Evidetice was offered on the part of the plaintiff below, and
admitted, to prove that the subsequent deliveries were equal
on an average with these shipments as to quality and size; and
that, calculating the entire quantity by this comparison, it
would show a delivery of 263,303 matched headings, more
than had been accounted for, which, at forty dollars per thousand, amounted to $10,582.12.
It was in evidence, on the part of defendant below, that

Oct. 1882.']

OIL CO. V. VAN ETTEN.

on the receipt of the heading at Cleveland it was inspected by
their inspector. This inspector being called as a witness, testified that he actually matched the whole of the first cargo as
it was counted and inspected, but the rest by only averaging
from samples; that is, he laid off and piled up a thousand
pieces, and arrived at the matching by seeing how many pieces
it took to make the number of inches, and made an average
from that. The whole number of pieces, as taken by the
teamsters, were reported to him, of which he made a record,
and then reduced it to matched heading, which he reported to
the company. The number of single pieces, in gross, was
2,296,160, making of matched beading 1,958,539 pieces. This,
he said, was the usual mode of counting and matching.
It was admitted, on the part of the defendant below, that, in
going carefully over the inspector's calculations, errors had
been discovered in computation, twenty-five in number, some
in favor of and some against the company, and resulting in a
balance of $144.34 against them, for which they admitted their
liability.
On the basis of the count of their inspector, the Standard
Oil Company rendered to Merritt & Co. an account, dated
Aug. 20, 1875, showing a credit balance of $542.54. That
balance was paid and accepted, and no objection made to the
statement of the account until the bringing of this suit, Jan.
10, 1876. One car-load of heading was shipped after the close
of that account, and was accounted for Sept. 25, 1875.
There was other evidence, on each side, which, it was
claimed, tended to establish the accuracy of the counts, respectively, made at Lapeer and at Cleveland. There was no evidence bearing upon the question of any loss of heading between
Detroit and Cleveland; but it did appear in evidence that
when the heading was loaded in Detroit, upon vessels, bills of
lading were made and delivered to the captains of the boats,
showing the number of car-loads of heading on each vessel,
which bills of lading were, upon the arrival of the vessels in
Cleveland, delivered to the defendant below, at its office, when
freight was paid thereon and charged to Merritt & Co., the
bills of lading being retained by the Standard Oil Company.
There was no evidence tending to impeach the good faith of

OIL CO. V. VAN ETTEN.

[Sup. Ct.

the count on either side, or that the inspector of the defendant
below was not a competent person for the business intrusted
to him.
The court charged the jury, in substance, that, by the terms
of the contract, as modified on April 1, 1874, the heading becanoe the property of the Standard Oil Company on delivery
at Lapeer on land leased by it, but subject to their inspection
and count at Cleveland; that, if that count was made fairly
and in the exercise of the best judgment of the inspector, it
would be binding on the plaintiff, unless its variance from the
actual truth was too great to be accounted for by any error of
judgment, in which case the plaintiff was not precluded from
showing a mistake; that, if upon all the evidence the jury
should be unable to determine whether there was fraud or mistake in the count upon either side, or if upon being satisfied
that there had been fraud or mistake they were unable to determine which party is responsible for it, they must find for
the defendant, except as to the small amount admitted to be
due. And the jury was also instructed that the count and inspection, so far as they involved the culling or rejection of
defective pieces and matching, so as to determine how many
single pieces were required to make a matched heading, according to the contract, were matters of judgment on the part of
the inspector, which, if honestly exercised, would be binding;
and that, consequently, the proof pf mistake, upon the case,
as it arose upon the evidence, was confined to the count of the
whole number of single pieces, and the consequent error, if
such were proved, as to the number of matched headings; although the defendant company was not bound by the contract
to make a gross count to determine the whole number of single
pieces, or to keep any memorandum or estimate of any such
gross count, or to make return thereof to Merritt & Co., its
duty being performed if it handled all the heading delivered
to it and honestly and correctly counted it in such a way as to
determine the number of complete heads.
As to the account stated and rendered, the court charged the
jury, in effect, that, the account having been rendered in September, 1875, and no objection having been made until January, 1876, by the bringing of the suit, it had been kept such a

Oct. 1882.]

OIL CO. v. VAN ETTEN.

time as made it an admission on the part of Merritt & Co. of
its correctness, but that the plaintiff was not estopped from
showing fraud or mistake in it, which, however, should be
made clearly to appear, the burden of proof resting upon the
plaintiff to establish it.
Various exceptions were duly taken to the rulings of the
court, in the admission of evidence, in refusing to instruct the
jury as requested, and to the charge as given, which, so far as
necessary, will be referred to in their order. A verdict was
returned in favor of the plaintiff below for $7,688, and judgment rendered thereon, which the defendant below now brings
into review upon this writ of error.
1. It is objected by the plaintiff in error, in the first place,
that the court erred in admitting evidence as to the counts by
both parties of the whole number of single pieces of heading,
and submitting to the jury the comparison between them, as
furnishing any means of establishing error in the count of
matched headings.
It is argued that the count of gross pieces was not recognized
by the contract, as it contemplated only a count of matched
headings; and that as this involved culling the bad from the
good, and the matching of single pieces to constitute the heading required by the contract, and then only a count of the
number of the latter, the process involved, at least in two of
its steps, the exercise of skill and judgment, and made it necessary, if mistake was relied on, to show directly that it had occurred in the actual count of matched headings.
But, as we have already stated, the culling had been dispensed with after the first four cargoes; and the matching, as
testified to by the inspector, was made upon an estimate based
upon a few experiments, according to which, upon an average,
the whole number of single pieces was reduced to matched
headings. It did become necessary, therefore, for the inspector
to make a count of the single pieces, as the means of arriving
at the number of matched headings. It was also contemplated
by the contract that a count of single pieces should be made at
Lapeer, by a counter, also appointed by the defendant below,
for the purpose of determining the amount of advances to which
Merritt & Co. were entitled; and although this count was not

332

OIL CO. V. VAN ETTEN.

[Sup. Ct.

the final and conclusive one, it was quite legitimate to use it in
comparison with that made at Cleveland, as one mode of testiug the accuracy of the latter. And this comparison was justified by the evidence, also objected to, that in those particulars
which might affect the ratio of single pieces 'to matched headings, such as size, quality, &c., the early cargoes, in respect to
which that ratio had been determined by actual inspection and
count, averaged no better than all subsequent deliveries. It
furnished to the jury, quite fairly and consistently with the
intent of the parties to the contract, a means of determining
whether there had not been a mistake in the last count,
properly limited by the court in the rule, that the discrepancy must be so great as that it could not reasonably be
accounted for by any mere variation'of judgment in the matter
of matching.
It is admitted by counsel for plaintiff in error, and such undoubtedly is the law, that the count of the inspector at Cleveland was subject to impeachment for fraud or mistake; the
mistake being not a mere alleged error of judgment, but one
of fact, which prevented the proper exercise of his judgment.
Such was the character of the mistake to which the evidence
was directed; namely, a mistake in counting the number of single pieces, which formed the basis of an estimate and average
from which the number of matched headings was deduced.
The objection seems to be directed to the mode of proof, it
being insisted that it should be direct evidence of the fact of a
mistake, independent of the evidence of its amount. But we
are not aware of any rule of law which requires any particular
method of proving such a fact, differing from that required to
prove any similar fact. Whatever naturally and logically tends
to establish it is competent evidence. If a stranger had stood
by at Cleveland, and, following the inspector in his count of
single pieces, had detected him in error, which would necessarily affect the final count of matched headings, he would
thereby have been a competent witness to prove the discrepancy. Proof of a similar count at Lapeer would differ only
in degree, and not in quality, as evidence to the same effect.
It is suggested, however, in reply to this, that in the latter
case an indispensable link in the chain necessary to connect

Oct. 1882..]

OIL Co. v. VAN ETTEN.

the count at Lapeer with that at Cleveland is wanting, because
it is admitted that there was no evidence to show that all the
pieces of heading shipped at Lapeer were, in fact, delivered at
Cleveland, and, for aught that appears, the quantity of the apparent difference may have been lost in transportation between
the two places. But whether this -was so probable, as to more
reasonably account for the discrepancy, than the supposition of
an error, in one or both counts, was a matter for the consideration of the jury. They were not bound to assume a loss in
transportation in the absence of any evidence on the subject,
and were entitled to assume that the shipments arrived at their
destination undiminished, in the absence of any reason to the
contrary, especially in view of the fact that there had been no
complaint from any quarter, that the number of car-loads called
for by the bills of lading'was not verified, or that more freight
had been charged and paid than would be due if there had
been a deficiency.
But independent of this, and on the assumption that the
whole amount of the discrepancy between the two counts could
be accounted for by an actual loss in transportation, the case
of the defendant below would not have been strengthened.
Although the count was to be of matched headings, and at
Cleveland, and conclusive in the absence of fraud or mistake,
nevertheless, by the modified contract of April 1, 1874, the
delivery of the heading took place at Lapeer, so as to pass the
property in the heading absolutely to the Standard Oil Company. And as the risk follows the title, any loss that subsequently accrued, by non-delivery on the part of the carriers,
would be the loss of the defendant below, and the plaintiff
would be entitled to recover the contract price on proof of the
quantity of single pieces reduced to matched headings, delivered at Lapeer, upon the best evidence that could be adduced
under such circumstances, although they could not be actually
counted and matched at Cleveland, as required by the terms of
the contract.
2. It is next objected by the 'plaintiff in error that the court
below erred in its rulings upon the account offered and admitted
in evidence, and which, it was claimed, was a stated account.
The claim on this part of the case is, that an account rendered

OIL Co. V. VAN ETTEN.

[Sup. Ot.

becomes an account stated, unless objected to within a reasonable time; that what constitutes a reasonable time in such a
case is a question of law; and that an account stated cannot be
impeached except for fraud or mistake; and in support of these
propositions counsel cite Perkins v. Hart, 11 Wheat. 237; Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300; Wiggins v. Burkham, 10 Wall.
129; Lockwood v. Thorne, 11 N. Y. 170; and other cases.
There is no dispute but that this is a correct statement of the
law, and it is precisely what was charged by the Circuit Court,
and in the very language of instructions asked for by the plaintiff in error. The court followed it up by adding also that the
lapse of time from September, 1875, when the account was rendered, to January, 1876, when the suit was began, without
objection, converted it into a stated account, which could be
impeached only for fraud or mistake:
But the same evidence which sufficed to establish a mistake
in the count at Cleveland on the part of the inspector, also
impeached the account, for it was founded on that count and
embodied its mistake.
3. It is further alleged as error that the court refused to instruct the jury, as requested by plaintiff in error, that "this
cause is based upon the ground of either fraud or mistake, and
there is no evidence of any kind, except the two counts," referring to the number of headings delivered,- and if the jury find
a verdict for the plaintiff, they must find a verdict for the entire amount. Either the defendant is liable for this entire
amount or it is not liable, except for the small sum admitted."
This request was very properly denied by the court. There is
no rule of law that limits, in such a manner, the discretion of
the jury in dealing with the evidence on a question of damages
in such a case. The very spirit of trial by jury is, that the
experience, practical knowledge of affairs, and common sense
of jurors, may be appealed to, to mediate the inconsistencies of
the evidence, and reconcile the extravagances of opposing theories of the parties. There was nothing illogical in the present
case, in the verdict of the jury, proceeding upon the supposition
of possible errors in both counts, and making probable allowances for their amount, although no mathematical calculation
could be made to demonstrate the exact accuracy of the result.

Oct. 1882.]

OIL Co. v. VAN ETTEN.

But even if the ruling was erroneous as alleged, it is difficult
to understand how it could have prejudiced the plaintiff in
error. The argument presupposes that the evidence justified a
verdict for the larger amount, and establishes merely that it
was for less than it might properly have been. Whatever error
was committed in this respect, was certainly not to the prejudice of the party complaining.
One of the witnesses for the plaintiff below, on cross-examination, was asked this question: "Have you not recently stated to different parties, in talking about the matter, that you wanted them to recover here,
because you would then get your pay ?"
The plaintiff's counsel objected to the question on the ground
that it did not specify time and place, to which suggestion defendant's counsel replied that he did not propose to impeach
the witness; whereupon the court sustained the objection, and
to that ruling an exception was taken.
There is no error in this. If the object was to impeach the
witness by subsequent contradiction, the question was clearly
incompetent, as too indefinite. If the design was to impeach
the witness in another mode, as by showing interest or bias,
supposing it to have been competent for such purpose, as to
which we express no opinion, it was the duty of counsel to
have accompanied his disclaimer with that qualification. He
must be taken, without such explanation, to have waived the
objection. The disclaimer, in its general form, was broad
enough to cover every form of impeaching the credit of the
witness, and it cannot be narrowed now without injustice. We
have considered all the exceptions of the plaintiff in error, and
find no error in the record.

Judgment affirmed.
