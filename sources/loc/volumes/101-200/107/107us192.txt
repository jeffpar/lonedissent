ATLANTIC WORKS.

1. Letters-patent granted to Edwin L. Brady, Dec. 17, 1867, for an improved
dredge-boat for excavating rivers, are invalid for want of novelty and invention.
2. The design of the patent laws is to reward those who make some substantial
discovery or invention, which adds to our knowledge and makes a step in
advance in the useful arts. It was never their object to grant a monopoly
for every trifling device, every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would
naturally and spontaneously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in
the ordinary progress of manufactures.
3. Although letters-patent are not set up by way of defence in an answer, yet if
the invention patented thereby is afterwards put into actual use, their date
will be evidence of that of the invention on a question of priority between
different parties.
4. One person receiving from another a full and accurate description of a useful
improvement cannot appropriate it to himself; and letters-patent obtained
by him therefor are void.

delivered the opinion of the court.
This case arises upon a bill in equity filed by Edwin L.
Brady against The Atlantic Works, a corporation of Massachusetts, having workshops and a place of business in Boston,
praying for an account of profits for building a dredge-boat in
violation of certain letters-patent granted to the complainant
bearing date Dec. 17, 1867, and for an injunction to restrain
the defendants from making, using, or selling any dredge-boat
in violation of said letters-patent. The bill was filed on the
9th of April, 1868, and had annexed thereto a copy of the
patent alleged to be infringed. The following are the material parts of the specification: MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY

"The excavator consists of a strong boat propelled by one or

two propellers placed in the stern of the boat. I prefer two pro-

pellers, as affording greater power and rendering the boat more
manageable in steering in iooked channels. This propeller is driven
in the ordinary manner by steam-engines of ordinary construction.
Near the bow of the boat I place another steam-engine, driving
what I call the 'mud-fan,' which projects from and in front of the
bow of the boat. This is formed by a set of revolving blades shown
at A, turned like the propellers, by a shaft passing through a stuffing-box, D. The blades are shaped somewhat like those of a propeller, but they are sharper on their fronts and less inclined on their
aces. These blades should extend, say, two feet below the bottom
of the boat, and their object is by their rapid revolution to displace the sand and mud on the bottom, and stirring them up, to
mix them with the water so that they may be carried off by the
current.
"The motion of the ' mud-fan' tends to draw forward the boat,
assisting the propellers.
"All the engines may be driven by one set of boilers, F, placed
amidships. In order that the 'mud-fan' may be brought in contact with the bottom, I construct the boat with a series of watertight compartments, E, placed in the bow and stern, and on each
side of the centre amidships, into which the water may be permitted to flow through pipes so as to sink the vessel to the required
depth; the compartments being so placed and proportioned that
the vessel shall sink with an even keel, by which the effective action of the ' mud-fan,' the propellers, and the steering apparatus is
preserved, the boat being manageable at any depth. A large pump,
B, driven by the engine, is connected by pipes with all the compartments, so that the water may be pumped out when necessary
to raise the boat.
"I am aware that boats have been constructed with compartments to be filled with water, to sink the dredging mechanism to
the bottom, by loading the end of the boat in which such -mechanism is placed; but this construction is subject to the disadvantage
of requiring more complicated machinery for dredging, in order
that it may be accommodated to the inclination of the boat, and to
the further disadvantage that the boats thus inclined are comparatively unmanageable.
"What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letterspatent, is: " 1. A dredging-boat, constructed with a series of water-tight
compartments, so proportioned and arranged that, as they are
filled with water, the boat shall preserve an even keel, and the

dreding mechanism be brought into action without any adjusting
devices, substantially as set forth.
"c2. The combination of the ' mud-fan' attached to a rigid shaft,
and a boat containing a series of water-tight compartments, E, so
adjusted as to cause the boat to settle on an even keel as the compartments are filled with water, and a pump, B, for exhausting the
water from all the compartments, substantially as set forth."
The defendants, in their answer, denied the validity of the
patent, and denied infringement of any valid patent of the
complainant. They then stated the circumstances under which
they came to construct the dredge-boat complained of; namely,
that in October, 1867, the government of the United States
advertised for proposals for building a dredge-boat for the
mouth of the Mississippi River, according to certain plans and
specifications; that the defendants, being manufacturers and
builders of marine engines and steamboats, examined the plans
and specifications, and made proposals for building the boat
according to the same; which were accepted; and they at
once began the construction of the boat and completed it under
the inspection and supervision of a United States officer, in
conformity with the stipulations; and the boat went in charge
of said officer to the mouth of the Mississippi River; that the
said plans and specifications were made and furnished by General McAlester, of the engineer corps of the United States, for
the use of the government, and were the result of his own
study, observations, and experience, and that so far as they
were original he was the author of them. They further alleged
by their answer (as amended) as follows: " That the plans
and specifications by which the said dredge-boat was constructed were not, and the said dredge-boat itself was not a new
invention, or novel and original; but the same, and the principle of said dredge-boat, had been substantially known and
publicly used before, to wit, at New Orleans, on the mouth of
the Mississippi River, in the year 1859, in the steam dredgeboat 'Enoch Train,' by Charles H. Hyde, by Thomas G. Mackie,
and William A. Hyde, copartners, under the firm of Hyde
& Mackie, and by Henry Wright, and had also been used and
applied in the construction of light-draft monitors, so called,
built by the United States government during the late rebel-

ATLANTIC WORKS V. BRADY.

lion, and long prior to the alleged patent or invention of the
said Brady and the dates of his patent or caveat, and one of
which said light-draft monitors was built at the works of these
defendants."
The answer further stated that in 1866 and 1867, prior to
the date of Brady's alleged invention, he was acting as agent
for one Tyler, in carrying out a contract with the government
for the improvement of the mouth of the Mississippi River;
that General McAlester was then stationed at New Orleans to
supervise and inspect, on behalf of the United States, the execution of the contract; that Brady was fitting and preparing
a steamboat for the purpose on a plan entirely different from
that of his alleged invention; that McAlester then detailed
and described to him a plan for a dredge-boat identical with
that of the boat constructed by the defendants; which plan
McAlester communicated to the board of engineers of the army
before the date of the alleged invention by Brady; that Brady's
boat was a failure, and the contract was annulled; that then
Brady made drawings for a boat on the plan described to him by
McAlester, and afterwards claimed to be the inventor of it, and
made application for his patent, and obtained the same after the
defendants had commenced work on the boat complained of.
Evidence was taken, and on a hearing before Mr. Justice
Clifford, in September, 1876, a decree was made sustaining the
patent, declaring that the defendants had infringed the same,
and referring it to a master to take an account of the profits
received by the defendants from the infringement. The master
reported the sum of $6,604.82. Both parties excepted, but
their exceptions were overruled, and a final decree, in accordance with the report, was rendered Oct. 9, 1878, with costs.
Both parties have appealed.
The most important question, and first to be considered, is
the validity of the patent.
It is obvious from reading the specification that the alleged
invention consists mainly in attaching a screw (which the
patentee calls a mud-fan) to the forward end of a propeller
dredge-boat, provided with tanks for settling her in the water.
It is operated by sinking the boat until the screw comes in
contact with the mud or sand, which, by the revolution of the

ATLANTIC WoRKs v. BRADY.

[Sup. Ct.

screw, is thrown up and mingled with the current. The use
of a series of tanks for the purpose of keeping the vessel level
whilst she settles is an old contrivance long used in dry-docks,
and is shown, by the evidence, to have been used in many lightdraft monitors during the late war. The defendants themMr. Edwards,
selves built one of these vessels, the "Casco."
the president of the Atlantic Works, in his testimony, says:
"The ' Casco' was built double, leaving a water-space on each
side nearly the entire length of the vessel, with an arrangement of valves for flooding the compartments at pleasure, for
the purpose of sinking the vessel to the desired draft of water,
and with powerful steam-pumps to pump the water out for the
purpose of raising it in the water. The compartment on the
side was divided into several, and one or all of them could be
filled as desired. The object was to enable them to put her on
an even keel, or to raise or depress one end at pleasure." The
employment of their screws by propeller ships, driven stern
foremost, for the removal of sand and mud accumulated at the
mouths of the Mississippi, had frequently occurred years before
the patentee's invention is alleged to have been made. Several French steamers, one of which was named the "Francis
Arago," had used this method there prior to the year 1859.
In that year the "Enoch Train," a double propeller, thab is, having two screws at her stern, was used in the same way by certain contractors under the government, for dredging the mouth
of the Mississippi. Mr. Hyde, one of the contractors and
owners, in his testimony, describes her construction and operation as follows "She was a propeller of burden between three and four hundred tons, with two propeller screws at her stern, about nine
feet in diameter each; the cylinders were thirty-six inches in
diameter and thirty-four inches stroke; she had one doctor engine; was fitted also with a large wrecking pump, with two lowpressure boilers; engines were also low-pressure engines. Her
draft of water, in ordinary trim, with three hundred barrels of
coal on board, was about thirteen feet aft, and a little less at the
bows. By ordinary trim I mean the usual sailing trim. The
propeller screws were one on each quarter, or each side of the
stern-post. Before going to dredging on the bar, I fitted her up

Oct. 1882.]

ATLANTIC WORKS V. BRADY.

with a water-tight apartment, or tank, at the stern, by a bulkhead running athwartships, say about twenty or twenty-five feet
from the stern. That space was divided by a fore-and-aft bulkhead, making two water-tight compartments.
"The mode of filling the compartments was by stop-cocks in
the sides of the vessel opening into the water-tight compartment; the draft of water could be increased from her natural
draft of water, say thirteen feet to eighteen feet, according to
the quantity of water let into the tanks. The mode of operating was by running the vessel up and down over the bar,
and thus stirring up the mud with the propeller screws.
When the water was too shoal for her to pass over, the stern of
the ves~el was turned to the bar, and she was run stern on, the
engines being reversed. Whenever we got done working on
the bar there was a valve in the water-tight compartments for
letting the water into the hold of the vessel, from which the
water was pumped out of the vessel, by the steam-pumps, and
the vessel would then be left at her ordinary draft.
"lht. 13. Please to state how you happened to employ this
mode of dredging by the ' Enoch Train.'
".Ans. Well, I thought it would be an effectual way of
removing the mud from the bar; that by the screws coming in
contact with the mud and deposit, and the revolutions of the
screws about sixty times a minute, would create a current of
water by which the sediment would be washed away."
The evidence of Henry Wright, the master of the "Enoch
Train," under whose charge her operations were conducted,
is to the same purport. He says: "We used to work our propellers in cutting up the mud.
The operation consisted in cutting through the mud with our
propellers. Sometimes we went at the mud stern foremost,
sometimes sideways, and sometimes bows on. When I went to
the bar at first there was about fifteen feet of water on it, and
when I quit operating there were eighteen feet on it in most
places. Where the water was shallow we invariably went at
the mud stern foremost,. The stern was always loaded down to
eighteen feet when dredging, but the bows were not loaded
down. In dredging, the stern was always several feet lower
down than the bows, say three or four feet."

ATLANTIC WORKs v. BRADY.

[Sup. Ct.

The boat built by the defendants, which was called the "Essayons," was operated in precisely the same way. Being built
expressly for dredging, her dredging screw was placed at her
stem, it is true; but her mode of operation was the same as
that of the "Enoch Train." Her master, Putnam, describes it
as follows: "The method we use is to go outside the bar into deep
water; then we sink the dredging end of the vessel, by filling
up the tanks at that end with water to any depth required.
Then we start the propelling screw at the other end of the
vessel, and go in with that until the vessel grounds; then we
stop the propelling screw and start the dredging screw, and as
that screw revolves it cuts up the mud at the bottom arid drags
the vessel after it at the same time; after going as far as we
wish we stop the dredging screw, lower the rake at the dredging end, and back out into deep water, using either or both of
the screws to go back with, thus dragging the mud after us
that the dredging screw has cut up from the bottom, and carrying it out into deep water; or rather, the operation is, that
the dredging screw agitates the mud and throws it up into the
surface current, and the current takes it out to a large extent, while the rake takes fresh hold of the bottom and also
carries out whatever is broken up by the screw and settles
from the current. After backing out into deep water, we
hoist the rake and go back again and repeat the operation.
When we first arrived at the bar we made several experiments as to the best mode of dredging, but the mode above
described we found to be the correct one, and have ever since
used."
Nearly all the witnesses examined on the subject declare
that there is no difference in principle between the mode of
operation of the "Enoch Train" and that of the "Essayons."
The scraping or raking apparatus is not mentioned in the
plaintiff's patent at all. This, as will be hereafter seen, is
part of the original design of General McAlester, the government officer who had charge of the improvement of the mouth
of the Mississippi.
It is further noticeable that the "Essayons," as is abundantly
established by the evidence, always worked with her stem

Oct. 1882.]

ATLANTIC WORKS v. BRADY.

sunk and depressed, and never with an even keel, upon which
special emphasis is placed by the patent in suit.
It may well be asked, at this point, Where was there any
invention in the device described in the patent ? Was it inven tion to place a screw for dredging at the stem of the boat?
Nothing more than this was in reality suggested by the patentee. And that was substantially what was done with the
French steamers prior to 1859, and with the "Enoch Train"
in that year. They were turned end for end, and the stern
was used as the stem, and the screws went forward, working
in the bottom deposit in advance of the vessels. When the
"Enoch Train" was procured for the service which she performed, she was ready made, and the contractors, to save time
and expense, simply supplied her with a tank, in order to settle her to the proper depth, and they found her very serviceable. Had she been built for a dredge-boat, with the design of
using screws for dredging (as she did use them), can it be
doubted that her dredging screw would have been placed forward instead of turning her stern forward? Would not this
have been suggested by ordinary mechanical skill ? The plan
and mode of operation would have been precisely the same.
When, after this, the government proceeded to build a boat
expressly for dredging the mouths of the Mississippi, we should
naturally expect to find it built as the " Essayons" was built,
with her dredging screws at the stem instead of the stern.
The making of them with longer blades than those of the propelling screw, and sharpened at the points, would be a matter
of course. No invention would be requisite for any of these
arrangements. It seems to us that the whole principle of the
"Essayons's" construction and furnishment, as well as that of
the patent in question, was anticipated by the "Enoch Train,"
if not by the French steamers, and that a patent for that principle, though qualified. by the natural incidents and adjuncts
of its application, ought not to be sustained.
The process of development in manufactures creates a constant demand for new appliances, which the skill of ordinary
head-workmen and engineers is generally adequate to devise,
and which, indeed, are the natural and proper outgrowth of
such development. Each step forward prepares the way for

ATLANTIC WORKS v. BRADY.

[Sup. Ct.

the next, and each is usually taken by spontaneous trials and
attempts in a hundred different places. To grant to a single
party a monopoly of every slight advance made, except where
the exercise of invention, somewhat above ordinary mechanical
or engineering skill, is distinctly shown, is unjust in principle
and injurious in its consequences.
The design of the patent laws is to reward those who make
some substantial discovery or invention, which adds to our
knowledge and makes a step in advance in the useful arts.
Such inventors are worthy of all favor. It was never the object of those laws to grant a monopoly for every trifling device,
every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would naturally and
spontaneously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in the
ordinary progress of manufactures. Such an indiscriminate
creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to obstruct than to
stimulate invention. It creates a class of speculative schemers
who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of
improvement, and gather its foam in the form of patented
monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the
industry of the country, without contributing anything to the
real advancement of the arts. It embarrasses the honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of concealed liens
and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexatious accountings
for profits made in good faith.
But the "Enoch Train " did not exhibit all that was done
in the matter of dredge-boats anterior to the alleged invention
of Brady. If the application of dredging screws to the stem of
a boat, driven by a propellor or otherwise, was not formally
exhibited in the "Enoch Train," it was certainly exhibited in
the invention of one Ephraim B. Bishop, which was patented
in April, 1858, and was applied by Brady himself to a dredgeboat called the "Wiggins Ferry," fitted up and operated by
him at the mouth of the Mississippi in 1866. This boat was
propelled by an ordinary centre paddle-wheel, and to the bow
was fixed two revolving conical-shaped screws, which, on being
let down to the river-bottom, cut and stirred up the mud and
sand, and caused it to float away in the current. Each screw
was driven by a separate steam-engine. Bishop was examined
as a witness, and testified that the idea occurred to him from

Oct. 1882.]

ATLANTIC WORKS v. BRADY.

seeing a stern-wheel boat on the Arkansas River make a channel for herself by turning stern foremost and removing the
sediment by the revolution of her propeller. He says: "About 1852 or 1853, I was then keeping store at Van
Buren, Arkansas. The difficulty of getting goods up the Arkansas River, in consequence of sand-bars, was very great, - so
great that we had a cargo of goods, nearly a whole boat-load,
that was detained in consequence of sand-bars for at least
eight months before she could reach Van Buren from Pine
Bluff, Arkansas. Seeing this necessity of removing these
obstructions, and knowing all about the usual machines up to
that date that had been invented, and their capacity, and
knowing of the very great amount of sediment that must be
removed to do any good, it appeared to me absolutely necessary that machinery of greater capacity and strength should
be invented, and, thinking upon this subject, I thought of and
planned out one or more spirally-flanged screws, to be rotated
by machinery on deck of a boat or in her hull, with the large
ends of the spiral screws down, with sharp cutting corners or
points, the screws to revolve right and left powerfully, intended
to elevate the sediment up the inclination of the drum by
reason of the powerful motion of those drums; the water
being comparatively still, would necessarily force the sediment
up the inclination of the screws, and throw the sediment off
to the right and left into the water, which would carry it to
harmless localities. This was the first plan that was afterwards developed into my patent."
In the fall of 1866 Brady and several other persons associated with him, Bishop himself being interested, made a
contract with the government to dredge the Southwest Pass of
the Mississippi, and procured for the purpose the " Wiggins
Ferry," and fitted up her bow with Bishop's apparatus. Brady
had the superintendence of her fitting up, and of operating
her after she was ready for work. They commenced upon her
in November, 1866, but did not get her started until the 19th
of March, 1867. After working with her for several months,
and finding that she was not strong enough for the work required in the Southwest Pass, and that the sediment would fill
up again when she was taken off for repairs (although they

ATLANTIC

WORKS v.

BRADY.

[Sup. Ct.

often succeeded in deepening the channel three or four feet),
the contract was abandoned. For a common river-bottom she
would have answered well enough. MIr. Roy, one of the parties interested in her, and who was on her for several days at
the commencement of her operations, says that in the pass,
before trying the bar, she worked very successfully. If her
machinery was not strong enough for accomplishing the hard
work to be done on the bar, she was nevertheless well fitted
for lighter dredging, and exemplified in her construction the
use of screws at her stem.
It is true that Bishop's patent was not set up by way of defence in the answer ; but there is no dispute as to the time it
was issued, and that fact, together with Bishop's testimony,
makes it clear that his invention, which was exemplified in the
" Wiggins Ferry," was made as far back as 1858, anticipating
Brady according to his own showing for at least seven or eight
years.
It is clear, then, that Brady did not invent the furnishing of
vessels with water-tanks, so arranged as to sink them on an
even keel; for these had been used long before in the lightdraft monitors: he did not invent the use of revolving screws
on a dredging-boat, for cutting and stirring up the mud and
sediment; for these had been used for that purpose on the
French steamers, and on the "Enoch Train," in and prior to
1859: he did not invent the use of water-tanks in a dredgingboat for sinking the screws down to the bottom or bar to be
dredged; for this plan had been adopted in the " Enoch
Train :" he did not invent the application of screws to the
forward end of a dredge-boat, so as to work in advance of the
boat; for this had been virtually done on the "Enoch Train,"
and was formally done on the "Wiggins Ferry," the plan of
which had been invented by Bishop in 1858. What, then,
did he invent? Did he make a selection and combination of
these elements that would not have occurred to any ordinary
skilled engineer called upon, with all this previous knowledge
and experience before him, to devise the construction of a
strong dredge-boat for use at the mouth of the Mississippi?
We think not. We think that there is no reasonable ground
for any such pretension.

Oct. 1882.]

ATLANTIC WORKS

v.

BRADY.

But if a different conclusion could be reached, to our minds
it is as certain as any fact depending on conflicting testimony
can be, that Brady derived the ideas embraced in his patent
from General McAlester, the government officer who in 1866
and 1867 had charge of the improvements at the mouth of the
Mississippi River, and that he never conceived these ideas till
they were communicated and explained to him by General
McAlester during the fitting up of the "Wiggins Ferry " at
New Orleans and during the progress of her operations at the
Southwest Pass. It is proved by overwhelming evidence that
during the whole period of her fitting up, and until it was developed by her working on the bar that she was incapable of
performing the work required of her at that place, that Brady
regarded and spoke of Bishop's plan as the best possible plan
that could be devised, and that although deeply interested in
the success of the operations, he never alluded to or hinted
at any plan of his own devising different from it. His whole
conduct for months, as well as his total silence on the subject
of any prior invention made by himself, in all his intercourse
with his associates in the contract, with the government officers
in charge, and with the superintendents and owners of the
foundry where the "Wiggins Ferry" was fitted up, is the
strongest possible proof that no such invention as he claims had
been projected by him. The witnesses who speak of his conversations and sketches in December, 1865, and early in 1866, as
communicated to them with the utmost freedom, with no apparent object so far as they were concerned, must either be
mistaken as to the time, or as to the devices described. Interested as he is in the result of the suit, his own testimony cannot
be allowed to prevail against a course of conduct so utterly at
variance with it. It may be true; but we cannot give it effect
against what he himself did, and did not do, without disregarding the ordinary laws that govern human conduct.
During the operations of the "Wiggins Ferry " on the bar,
it is true, he did make divers plans and drawings for an improved dredge-boat. The first, made as Lieutenant Payne
says, a week or ten days after the vessel arrived at the South-west Pass (therefore the last of March or first of April), was
merely a modification of Bishop's plan, placing the cones

ATLANTIC WORgs V. BRADY.

[Sup. Gt.

parallel to each other instead of being pointed together in a
salient angle, and providing the boat with water-tight compartments by which she could be raised or lowered. ie
worked at these drawings for some time, and Lieutenant Payne
helped him to make tracings of them. In one corner of the
drawings on the same sheet two or three screws were exhibited, intended to be used in place of the cones if thought
best or desired. It is stated in the bill that on the 17th of
May, 1867, Brady filed a caveat in the Patent Office, describing his invention; but the patent was not obtained till the
17th of December following. No copy of the caveat appears in
the record, so that we cannot tell what it contained.
Now, where was it that Brady, who had been so enthusiastic
upon the superlative merits of Bishop's plan as applied to the'
" Wiggins Ferry," obtained the new light which resulted in
the filing of his caveat the 17th of May, and in the obtaining
of his patent in December? The story is told by Lieutenant
Payne, who appears to be, not only an intelligent, but an entirely disinterested, witness. He says: " In the latter part of February, 1867, at the engineer office,
New Orleans, Gen. McAlester told Brady that he had doubts
of the successful working of the 'Wiggins,' and in the case
of her proving a failure he should suggest to the engineer department a plan of his own for doing that work, which plan
he then explained to Brady in my presence. He said he
should recommend the building of a strong vessel provided
with propellers at each end, and arranged with water-tight
compartments, so that the vessel could be raised or lowered at
pleasure. She was also to be provided with scrapers, which
could be attached at either end, and raised or lowered at will by
machinery. She was to have rudders at each end, and be able
to move in either direction, either head or stern, equally well.
He proposed to try the scrapers first, and if they were not found
to work satisfactorily, to try any other device which might be
thought practicable. Brady seemed to be much pleased with
the idea, but seemed confident of the success of the ' Wiggins."'
It further appears that General McAlester, in pursuance of
his idea, communicated his plans to the government board of
engineers, and during the spring and summer of 1867, com-

mencing as early as April, prepared the plans and specifications
according to which the " Essayons" was afterwards built. It
is very strange that the copy of General McAlester's letters
to the department, and several other important exhibits that
were put in evidence, have not been inserted in the record
used on this appeal. Where the fault lies, it is not for us to
say. Sufficient appears, however, notwithstanding the evidence adduced to the contrary, consisting mostly of the testimony of the complainant himself, to convince us that Brady
derived his whole idea from the suggestions of General McAlester; and that the plans for the construction of the "E,ssayons"
originated entirely with that officer.
Our conclusion is, that the patent sued on cannot be sustained, and that the decree of the Circuit Court must be
reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss
