v. WALKER.

[Sup. Ct.

UNioN TRUST COMPANY v. WALKER.
An assignment of such claims as are mentioned in Union Trust Company v.
Souther, ante, p. 591, passes the right of the original holder to payment out of
the fund in the hands of the receiver.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Illinois.

Mr. S. Corning Judd and Mr. William F. Whitehouse for the
appellant.
Mr. Thomas- C. Fletcher for the appellee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICrE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This case differs from Union Trust Company v. Souther, ante,
p. 591, only in the fact that Walker, the present intervenor
and appellee, is the assignee by purchase froni the original
holders of the claims he seeks to have paid, and one of the
questions certified is whether, being an assignee and not an
original holder, he is entitled to payment. We have no hesitation in answering this question in the affirmative. As was
said in Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U. S. 235, 253, these creditors are
paid not because they have in law a lien on the mortgaged
property or the income, but because in equity the earnings of
the company constitute a fund for the payment of the expenses which their claims represent, before any income arises
which ought to be applied to the discharge of the mortgage
debt. Under such circumstances, it is a matter of no importance that the 'original creditor has parted with the claim.
The right is one that attaches to the debt and not to the
person of the original creditor. Consequently the right passes
with an assignment of the debt.
