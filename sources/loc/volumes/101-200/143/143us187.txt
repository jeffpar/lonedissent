APPEAL

MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPAINY
v. HANFORD.

FROM THE CIRCUIT
THE NORTHERN

No. 25.

COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

Argued and submitted March 26, 1891.-Decided February 29, 1892.

Under the law of Illinois, a grantee who by the terms of an absolute conveyauce from the mortgagor assumes the payment of the mortgage
debt, is liable to an action at law by the mortgagee; the relation of the
grantee and the grantor towards the mortgagee is that of principal and
surety; and therefore a subsequent agreement of the mortgagee with
the grantee, without the assent of the grantor, extending the time of
payment of the mortgage debt, discharges the grantor from all personal
liability for that debt.

THIS was a bill in equity, filed March 30, 1878, by the
Union Mutual Life Insurance Company, a corporation of
MIaine, against Philander C. Hanford, Orrin P. Chase, Frederick L. Fake and Lucy D. Fake, his wife, citizens of Illinois,
to foreclose by sale a mortgage of land in Chicago, and to
obtain a decree for any balance due the plaintiff above the
proceeds of the sale. Fake and wife were defaulted, and
Hanford and Chase answered. The case was heard upon
a master's report and the evidence taken before him, by
which (so far as is material to be stated) it appeared to be as
follows:
On September 9, 1870, Hanford and Chase mortgaged the
land to one Schureman to secure the payment of three promissory notes of that date, signed by them, and payable to his
order, one for $5000 in one year, and the second for $5000
in two years, each with interest at the rate of eight per cent
annually; and the third for $6000 in three years, with interest at the rate of ten per cent annually.
On January 30, 1871, (the first note having been paid,) the
plaintiff, through one Boone, its financial agent, bought -the
mortgage, and Schureman indorsed the remaining notes and
assigned the mortgage to the plaintiff.

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Argument for Appellant.

On September 9, 1872, Hanford and Chase conveyed the
land to Mrs. Fake by deed of warranty, "with the exception
of and subject to" the mortgage, (describing it,) "which said
mortgage or trust deed, and the notes for which the same is
collateral security," (describing them,) "it is hereby expressly
agreed shall be assumed and paid by the party of the second
part, and when paid are to be delivered fully cancelled to said
Chase and 'Hanford."
At or about the date of this conveyance, Chase called with
Fake at Boone's office, and told him that Hanford and Chase
had sold the property to Mrs. Fake, and that she was to
pay the mortgage, and Boone, as Chase testified, "said 'all
right,' or something of that sort." At the same interview,
Boone, as the plaintiff's agent, in consideration of $150 paid
him by Chase, extended the $5000 note until September 9,
1874.
Fake, as his wife's agent, afterwards paid interest on the
notes to Boone, as the plaintiff's agent; and on January 9,
1875, for the sum of $340, obtained from him, without the
knowledge of Hanford or Chase, an extension of the* notes
until September 9, 1875.
The principal defence relied on by Hanford and Chase was
that they were discharged from personal liability on the notes
by this extension of the time of payment without their
consent.
The value of the mortgaged premises in September, 1874,
was $18,000 to $19,000, and at the date of the master's report
in April, 1879, was $10,000 to $15,000 only.
The land was sold by the master, under order of the court,
for $12,000, which was insufficient to satisfy .the sums due on
the mortgage; and the plaintiff, after notice to Hanford and
Chase, moved for a deficiency decree for a sum amounting,
with interest, to more. than $5000. The Circuit Court overruled the motion. 27 Fed. Rep. 588. The plaintiff appealed
to this court.

189

Opinion of the Court.

The appellees, being at the inception of the notes the principal debtors, continued, notwithstanding the assumption by
Lucy D. Fake, to be personally liable thereon, and the appellant never lost the right to proceed directly upon the personal
obligation.
Ober v. Gallagher, 93 U. S. 199; VFansant v.
Allmon, 23 Illinois, 30.
The assumption of the notes by Lucy D. Fake, at most,
added only another principal obligor to the debt. It did not
change the obligation of the appellees from that of being
principal obligors to that of being sureties merely. Shepherd

354.
An extension of time for the payment of the indebtedness
to one principal debtor does not discharge a co-debtor, who is
also a principal, from his obligation upon the debt. Shepherd

TE. JUSTICE GIRAY, after stating the case as above, delivered
the opinion of the court.

Few things have been the subject of 'more difference of
opinion and conflict of decision than the nature and extent of
the right of a mortgagee of real estate against a subsequent
grantee who by the terms of the conveyance to him agrees to
assume and pay the mortgage.
All agree that the grantee is liable to the grantor, and that,
as between them, the grantee is the principal and the grantor-

Opinion of the Court.

is the surety for the payment of the mortgage debt. The
chief diversity of opinion has been upon the question whether
the grantee does or does not assume any direct liability to the
mortgagee.By the settled law of this court, the grantee is not directly
liable to the mortgagee, at law or in equity; and the only remedy of the mortgagee against the grantee is by bill in equity in
the right of the mortgagor and grantor, by virtue of the right
in equity of a creditor to avail himself of any security which
his debtor holds from a third person for the payment of the
debt. Feller v. Ashford, 133 U. S. 610; Willard v. W~ood,
135 U. S. 309. In that view of the law, there might be difficulties in the way of holding that a person who was under no
direct liability to the mortgagee was his principal debtor, and
that the only person who was directly liable to him was
chargeable as a surety only, and consequently that the mortgagee, by giving time to the person not directly and primarily
liable to him, would discharge the only person who was thus
liable. Shepherd v. Lay, 115 U. S. 505, 511; Keller v. Askford, 133 U. S. 610, 625. But the case at bar does not present
itself in that aspect.
The question whether the remedy of the mortgagee against
the grantee is at law and in his own right, or in equity and in
the right of the mortgagor only, is, as was adjudged in Willard v. Wood, above cited, to be determined by the law of the
place where the suit is brought. By the law of Illinois, where
the present action was brought, as by the law of New York
and of some other States, the mortgagee may sue at law a
grantee who, by the terms of an absolute conveyance from the
mortgagor, assumes the payment of the mortgage debt. Dean
v. Walke, 107 Illinois, 540, 545, 550; Tormpsor v. Dearborn, 107 Illinois, 87, 92; Bay v. Williams, 112 Illinois, 91;
Burr v. Beers, 24: N. Y. 178; Thorp v. Keokuk Coal Co., 48
N. Y. 253. According to that view, the grantee, as soon as
the mortgagee knows of the arrangement, becomes directly
and primarily liable to the mortgagee for the debt for which
the mortgagor was already liable to the latter, and the relation
of the grantee and the grantor, towards the mortgagee, as

Opinion of the Court.

well as between themselves, is thenceforth that of principal
and surety for the payment of the mortgage debt. Where
such is held to be the relation of the parties, the consequence

must follow that any subsequent agreement of the mortgagee
with the grantee, without the assent of the grantor, extending
the time of payment of the mortgage debt, discharges the
grantor from all personal liability for that debt.
Calvo v.
Davies, 73 N. Y. 211; .Home .Vazional Bank v. Waterman,
134 Illinois, 461, 467.
The case is thus brought within the well settled and familiar
rule that if a creditor, by positive contract with the principal
debtor, and without the consent of the surety, extends the time
of payment by the principal debtor, he thereby discharges the
surety; because the creditor, by so giving time to the principal,
puts it out 9 f the power of the surety to consider whether he
will have recourse to his remedy against the principal, and
because the surety cannot have the same remedy against the
principal as he would have had under the original contract;
and it is for the surety alone to judge whether his position is
altered for the worse. 1 Spence Eq. Jur. 638; Samuell v.
Howarth, 3 Meriv. 272; 2liller v. Stewart, 9 Wheat. 680, 703.
The rule applies whenever the creditor gives time to the principal, knowing of the relation of principal and sufety, although
he did not know of that relation at the time of the original
contract; Ewin v. Zancaster, 6 B. & S. 571 ; Oriental Financial Coyoration v. Owrend, L. R. 7 Oh. 142, and L. R. 7 I. L.
348; WA eat v. Kendall, 6 N. El. 504; Guild v. Butler, 127
Mass. 386; or even if that relation has been created since that
time. Oakeley v. Pasheller-,4 Cl. & Fin. 207, 233; S. C. 10
Bligh N. R. 548, 590; Colgrove v. Tallman, 67 N. Y. 95;
Smith v. Slelden, 35 Michigan, 42.
In the case at bar, the mortgagee, immediately after the
absolute conveyance by the mortgagors, was informed of and
assented to that conveyance and the agreement of the grantee
to pay the mortgage debt, and afterwards received interest on
the debt from the grantee; and the subsequent agreement by
which the mortgagee, in consideration of the payment of a
sum of money by the grantee, extended the time of payment

of the debt, was made without the knowledge or assent of the
mortgagors. Under the law of Illinois, which governs this

case, the mortgagors were thereby discharged from all personal liability on the notes, and the Circuit Court rightly
refused to enter a deficiency decree against them.

NEW ORLEANS CITY AND LAKE RAILROAD
COMPANY v. NEW ORLEANS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
No. 119. Argued December 4, 7,1891.-Decided February 29,1892.
An ordinance of a city, imposing, pursuant to a statute of the Statea
license tax, for the business of running any horse or steam railroad for the
transportation of passengers, does not impair the obligation of a contract,
made before the passage of the statute, by which the city sold to a railroad company for a large price the right of way and franchise for twentyfive years to run a railroad over certain streets and according to certain
regulations, aunl the company agreed to pay to the city annually a real
estate tax, and the city bound itself notto grant, during the same period,
a right of way to any other railrob.4 company over the same streets.

THIS was a summary proceeding by the city of New Orleans
against the New Orleans City and Lake Railroad Company,
in a civil district court of the parish of Orleans, to collect a
license tax of $2500 for the year 1887, imposed by an ordinance
of the city, pursuant to the statute of Louisiana of 1886, c. 101,
§ 8, which provided "that for the business of carrying on,
operating or running any horse or steam railroad, or both, for
the transportation of passengers within the limits of any city
or town in this State, the annual license shall be based on the
annual gross receipts, as follows: viz.: First class - When the
said annual gross receipts are five hundred thousand dollars,
or in excess of that amount, the license shall be twenty-five
hundred dollars." Acts of Louisiana of 1886, pp. 165, 175.
The defendant admitted that its annual gross receipts were
more than $500,000; but contended that the statute and ordi-
