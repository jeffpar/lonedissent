HAMMOND v. HOPKINS.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT -OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 62. Argued November 11, 12, 1891..-Decided February 29, 1892.

A court of equity will not aid a party wlose application is destitute of conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence, but will discourage stale
demands, for the'peace of society, by refusing to interfere where there
has been gross lacies in prosecuting rights, or where long acquiescence
in the assertion of adverse rights has occurred; and in these respects each
case must be governed by its own circumstances.
A purchase by a trustee of trust property, for his own benefit, is not absolutely void, but voidable; and it may be confirmed by the parties interested,
either directly, or by long acquiescence, or by the absence of an election
to avoid the conveyance within a reasonable time after the facts come to
the knowledge of the cestui que trust.
Two partners owned real estate in common, some of which was used in the
partnership business. One died making the other by his will a trustee
for the testator's children, with power of sale of all the real estate, and
directing that the business be carried on. After carrying on the business for some time the trustee sold the real estate, by auction, and
bought portions of it in through a third person, and accounted for the
half of the net proceeds. This transaction was open, and was known to all
the cestuis que trustent, and was objected to by none of them. .fel,
That there was nothing in all this to indicate fraud.

HAMIMOND v. HOPKINS.
Statement of the Case.
In all cases where actual fraud is not made out, but the imputation rests
upon conjecture, where the seal of death has closed the lips of those
whose character is involved, and lapse of time has impaired the recollection of transactions and obscured their details, the welfare of society
demands the rigid enforcement of the rule of diligence.

THE

court stated the case as follows:

This was a bill filed in the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia, April 8, 1884, by William B. Hopkins; Anna B. Hopkins, by her next friend William B. Hopkins; Sarah E. Hopkins,
by her next friend Elizabeth A. Early; Elizabeth A. Early; Mary
V. Wailes; Alice C. Hall; and Ida M. Stone; against Bertha
Hopkins; Bertha Hopkins, administratrix of John S. Hopkins;
Esther E. Hopkins; Elizabeth B. Luttrell; Ira W. Hopkins;
Mary E. Hopkins; Bettie Davenport; Samuel C. Raub, trustee
for Bettie Davenport; Samuel C. Raub, executor of George
N. Hopkins; L. Freddie Hopkins, administratrix i Thomas J.
Luttrell, administrator of George W. Hopkins; and Thomas
J. Luttrell; executor of Cornelius Hopkins; alleging that prior
to and on the 23d day of November, in the year 1858, John
Hopkins and George W. Hopkins were seized and possessed
in fee simple, each of an undivided moiety, as tenants in common, of squares numbered ninety-four- (94), ninety-five (95),
ninety-six (96), one hundred and ten (110), and one hundred
and eleven (111); in the city of Washington, as laid down on
the public plats of the city; and that John Hopkins, on that
day, executed his last will and testament, a copy of which
was annexed. That John Hopkins died November 27, 1858,
leaving his children and heirs-at-law, Isaac H. Hopkins; Elizabeth A. Early, born Hopkins; George Washington Hopkins;
William M. S. Hopkins; Emeline V. Lilburn, born Hopkins;
Mary V. Wailes, born Hopkins; Alice C. Hall, born Hopkins,
John S. Hopkins, and Levin Hopkins. That Isaac H. and
Levin Hopkins have since died intestate and without issue;
that George Washington Hopkins died in the month of July,
1870, leaving as his only children and heirs-at-law, William B.
Hopkins, then eleven years of age, and Anna B. Hopkins, then
two years of age; that the said Emeline V. Lilburn conveyed

on April 7, 1884, all her right and title absolutely and unconditionally in said estate to her daughter Ida Mvi. Stone; and that
John S. Hopkins died :May 7, 1883, leaving a5 his only child
and heir-at-law the defendant Bertha Hopkins.
That the said George W. and John S. Hopkins accepted the
said trust, entered into possession of said premises, carried on
the business of brick making for several years, collected the
rents and profits of said estate, and, as is charged upon information and belief, sold at various times prior to May 1, 1864,
portions of said property for which they received certain
moneys, the particulars of which complainants propose to
prove before the auditor.
It was then charged that it had lately come to the knowledge of the plaintiffs that "at this period" the trustees meditated a fraudulent scheme to obtain the entire estate in their
own right, "freed and discharged of the trusts under which they
held it," and that, "in pursuance of this scheme of fraud," John
S. Hopkins persuaded his brother William M. S. to convey to
him his share in his father's estate, (William being of dissipated habits and mentally enfeebled by alcoholic excesses,) by
deed dated June 20, 1860, and recorded July 7, 1860, and
under his command and direction to sign the name of his wife,
Sarah E. Hopkins, thereto; and by means of fraud obtained
the certificate of acknowledgment to said deed of two justices
of the peace. Ignorance of these facts was averred, the circumstances of their discovery to be thereafter stated at length.
It was further stated that William' . S. Hopkins on January 28, 1864, conveyed all his right, title and interest in his
father's estate to one Christopher Ingle, in trust for the benefit of his wife Sarah E. Hopkins, which fact had lately come
to the knowledge of the complainants under circumstances that
would thereinafter be set forth at length.
The bill then alleged that in pursuance of the fraudulent
scheme before mentioned the trustees advertised the property
for sale at public auction on May 10, 1864, a copy of which
advertisement was annexed. That they fraudulently procured
James Chapman to attend the sale and bid on their behalf as
individuals, and that Chapman became the purchaser for them

of squares 95, 96 and 111; of lot 1, square 94; and lots 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 38 and 39, in square 110; and that. on -ay
20, 1864, George W. and John S. Hopkins conveyed the property to Chapman for the consideration of one dollar, and Chapman reconveyed, under the same date, square 111 to George
W. Hopkins, as an individual, for the alleged consideration of
$9093.42, and the other property to George W. and John S.
Hopkins, as individuals, for the alleged consideration of $10,842. 24, all the conveyances being recorded November 16, 1864.
Plaintiffs averred that the purchases by Chapman were for the
benefit of th6 trustees as individuals without the knowledge
or consent of the plaintiffs.
It was further charged that "the said trustees, in furtherance of their said fraudulent scheme to possess themselves
individually of the said trust estate and brick business, and in
order to give a semblance of right to their said fraudulent
conduct, did, after a lapse of nearly seven years from the death
of their testator, file in the orphans' court of said district 'a
first and final account' of what purported to be an 'account
of the personal estate of John Hopkins, deceased, by George
W. and John S. Hopkins, executors,' alleged to consist of the
personal estate of said decedent, of the profits made out of the
brick business, and the value of the deceased's interest in
the firm of John and George W. Hopkins, showing that there
was for distribution the sum of $22,131.46, and these plaintiffs
have caused diligent search to be made among the records of
said orphans' court for the vouchers and papers on which said
account was based, but have not been able to find the same,
so as to discover in what manner the item of $14,952.66, the proceeds of sale of the half interest, was made up, a certified copy
of which account is herewith filed and prayed to be read as d
part of this bill; and the said trustees, without explaining the
nature of their trust or their fraudulent conduct in regard to
said sales, and without actual notice to or any personal knowledge of any of these plaintiffs, did obtain an order of said
court directing a distribution of the sum of $2667.60 to each
of the children then living of said John Hopkins as heirs-atlaw." The payment of the distributive shares under the order,

(except that allotted to William M. S. Hopkins,) was admitted,
but the jurisdiction of the court denied, and ignorance of the
alleged fraud set up in excuse of any estoppel arising from the
acceptance of and receipts for their shares.
Certain sales to bona,#de purchasers prior to November 16,
1864, and prior to December 22, 1875, were referred to, and
the receipts of moneys therefor. It was then alleged "that
the said trustee, George IV. Hopkins, trustee as aforesaid, died
intestate on the 22d December, 1875, leaving as his only
children and heirs-at-law George N. Hopkins; said defendants, Elizabeth B. Luttrell, born Hopkins, Ira W. Hopkins,
Mary E. Hopkins, and Cornelius Hopkins; that letters of
administration on his estate were granted to said defendants,
L. Freddie Hopkins and Thomas J. Luttrell; that said George
N. Hopkins has since died, on Nov. 18th, 1881, having first
devised, by way of executory devise, all his real estate to said
defendant Samuel 0. Rab, as trustee for said defendant
Bettie Davenport, her heirs and assigns; that the contingency
on which said devise was limited has happened, and the
equitable estate in fee simple is vested in her, as all of which
will more fully appear by reference to said will hereto annexed, and prayed to be read as part of this bill; that letters
of administration on said George N. Hopkins' estate were
granted to said defendant, Samuel'C. Raub; the said Cornelius Hopkins has since died, on July 17th, 1883, having
devised his entire estate as follows: One-half to said defendant Mary E. Hopkins, one-quarter to said defendant Elizabeth
B. Luttrell, and one-quarter to said defendant Ira W. Hopkins; that to said Thoinas J. Luttrell letters testamentary
have been granted as executor of said Cornelius Hopkins.'
Partition proceedings between John S. Hopkins and tile
heirs of- George W. Hopkins, and between the heirs of
George W. Hopkins, were then set up, and the sale by John
S. Hopkins of lots allotted to him to bona fide purchasers, as
also by the heirs of George W. Hopkins. It was further
averred that John 5. Hopkins died May '7, 1883, leaving him
surviving, his widow, Esther E: Hopkins, and Bertha Hopkins, his only child and heir-at-law, and that letters of adminis-

Statement of the Case.

tration on his estate had been granted to Bertha Hopkins as
sole administratrix.
The bill then stated:
"That these plaintiffs do severally aver that they have
within the last past few weeks discovered for the first time
the following circumstances in the manner herein set out,
namnely, that when the said John S. Hopkins, trustee, induced
his brother and ceti que trust, William M. S. Hopkins; to convey to him his estate, as alleged in paragraph eight, the said
John S. Hopkins charged the said William that he should
not tell his wife, the said plaintiff Sarah E. Hopkins, of his
having made such deed, and threatened him that if he did'his
said wife would leave him and return to Baltimore to her
father; that numberless times from that time to the date of
his death the said John S. Hopkins inquired of the said William if he had ever informed his wife of the conveyance to
him, and on every occasion urged him not to do so; that the
said William, being always poor and frequently in positive
want for the absolute necessities of life, Was constantly importuning the said John S. Hopkins for his share of the estate
and waiting for a division when the said John S. Hopkins
did pay to the said William at various times in all about nine
hundred dollars, and put him off by alleging that he was waiting for the property to rise in value, and when he sold that
the said William would get his share. At other times when
the said William would threaten to sue the said John S. Hopkins, the latter would bluff him off by such statements that if
he did sue he would not get a cent, but that he would give it
to his wife who had separated from said William, and that so
it was, by intimidations, threats and promises, the said William was always waiting to the hour of the death of the said
John S. Hopkins in the hope that he would get his share of
the estate; that when the said John S. Hopkins died unexpectedly on May 7th 1883, and had made no provision for the
said William, the said William began to seek the advice of
counsel as to what were his rights, and after having consulted
several without effect, at a considerable waste of time, finally
placed his case, about the first of February last past, in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

hands of Samuel L. Phillips, attorney-at-law; that the said
attorney undertook the investigation of the case, and discovered for the first time from living disinterested witnesses that
the said James Chapman had never paid one dollar of consideration for said land, but had bought the saiie for and on
account of said trustees, and that the sale was fraudulent and
void; that the said attorney discovered that the said William
had conveyed his interest to said Ingle in trust for said plaintiff Sarah E.-Hopkins, his wife, and if any recovery was to
be had the said Sarah E. Hopkins should 'be informed of her
rights. The said attorney thereupon wrote a letter to said
Sarah E. Hopkins, residing in Baltimore, Aid., -and who in a
day or two after its receipt came to Washington, called on
said attorney, and this plaintiff Sarah E. Hopkins avers was
told for the first time in her life on the 5th of February, 1884,
either of the conveyance by said William to said John S.
Hopkins, or the conveyance'of William to said Ingle in trust
for her benefit, or of the fraudulent practices of said trustees
as hereinbefore set forth as to the purchase of said land, and
the said Sarah E. Hopkins has thereupon authorized -said
attorney to bring suit to enforce her rights; that in order to
secure further information, if any existed, the said attorney
instructed the said William to call on his sisters and make an
appointment with them to see him, said attorney, which the
said William did do during the month of February or March,
1884, and at which interview the said William informed these
plaintiffs Elizabeth A. Early, Mary V. Wailes and Alice 0.
Hall, of the discovery of witnesses who would testify that the
said sales from said trustees to said Chapman and said Chapman to said George W-. Hopkins and John S. Hopkins jointly
and to said George W. Hopkins individually were without
consideration, fraudulent and void, as hereinafter set forth,
and these plaintiffs aver that this was the first time in their
lives that they or either of them had ever been informed or in
any manner known of said fraudulent sales or had any reason
to' suspect that the same were not true and bonajde; that the
said attorney called March 27th last past on these plaintiffs
Elizabeth A. Early, Mary V. Wailes and Alice C. Hall, and

said Emeline V. Lilburn, and they severally aver that they were
informed by said attorney for the first time of 'the particulars
of the fraudulent practices of said trustees in buying at their
own sales through said Chapman, as hereinbefore set forth; but
on the contrary aver that by the assurance of said trustees that
the same were bonXide, by the suppression of the truth these
many years, by the fact that they were always informed that
the said trustees had plenary power under said will of their
father, by the great confidence they had in the integrity of
their said uncle, by their incapacity as females, entirely unused
to business, these plaintiffs Elizabeth A.' Early, Mary V.
Wailes, Alice C. Hall and their sister, Emeline V. Lilburn,
have uncomplainingly submitted to what they have often
deplored as their ill fortune, while another member of the
family, their own brother, and his daughter, claiming through
the same ancestors, was in possession of estates worth over
two hundred thousand dollars; that these plaintiffs thereupon
immediately resolyed to enforce such rights as they were
entitled to, and authorized said attorney to take the necessary
legal proceedings; that this plaintiff William B. Hopkins was
a child only five years of age when said fraudulent sale was
made, and said plaintiff Anna B. Hopkins, was not born for
nearly five years afterwards, and that this plaintiff William B.
Hopkins on the 31st day of March last past, was for the first
time in his life informed of the facts hereinbefore recited as to
said fraudulent conveyances by said trustees and Chapman;
the said Anna B. Hopkins is still an infant fifteen years of
age ; that Emeline V. Lilburn, the grantor of this plaintiff Ida
K. Stone- was present on March 27 last past at the 'interview
of said attorney with her said sisters, and heard for the 'first
time in her life that the said sales from said trustees to said
Chapman and back to said George W. Hopkins and John S.
Hopkins and George W. Hopkins individually were fraudulent
and void for the causes herein set forth; and fhe said plaintiff
Ida M. Stone does aver that down to said 27th day of March
the said Emeline V. Lilburn knew nothing of said fraudulent
practices of said trustees or either of them, but on the contrary'
discovered the same in the manner hereinbefore set forth;

and the said plaintiff Ida Al. Stone does aver that she was
ignorant of the same down to April 7, 1884, the date of the
conveyance to her, said plaintiff, by her mother, said Emeline
V. Lilburn.
"Whereby if these plaintiffs shall prove these facts to the
satisfaction of your honorable court, they allege that they
have been guilty of no negligence in the prosecution of their
rights, and are entitled to relief.
"That these plaintiffs have been informed and so aver that
there is yet unsold a large portion of said estate, and in the
possession of said defendants, namely, sublots four and six, in
square 95 ; subdivision lots 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 39 and 40,
in square 96; subdivision lots 14 and 15, in square 94; and
that the same are worth two hundred thousand dollars, and
that the distributive share of each of these plaintiffs will
amount to twenty thousand dollars."
Complainants thereupon prayed that the deeds "from said
trustees to said Chapman, and from said Chapman to said
George W. H6pkins and John S. Hopkins jointly, and to said
George W. Hopkins individually, may be declared void and
cancelled, and that the said estate is held by the defendants,
as heirs-at-law of said George W. Hopkins, on the original
trusts mentioned in said will of John Hopkins, deceased.
That the said estate may be divided, as it was the duty of said
trustees to have done. That an account may be stated of the
sums received, with interest, on all sales made by said trustees
or either of them, or by any of the defendants, and also of
what these plaintiffs or either of them received, with interest,
on said pretended division, and that these plaintiffs may be
allowed, according to their respective interests, their shdres of
such sales, and that such sums found to be due to each of
these plaintiffs may be declared to be a lien on the said real
estate respectively held by them, the defendants." And for
judgment and execution; injunction; a receiver; and general
relief. Answers sander oafih were expressly iwaived.

named to her by defendant Samuel 0. Raub, as to whom the.
bill was taken as confessed.
The answers of defendants Bertha Hammond, Esther E.
Hopkins, Elizabeth B. Luttrell, Ira W. Hopkins, Mary E.
Hopkins, and Thomas J. Luttrell .were duly filed, denying
specifically the different allegations of fraud. They admitted
that Chapman purchased for the benefit of the trustees, and
one of them, but with the knowledge and acquiescence of
all parties interested; and the circumstances in reference to
the sale were thus set forth in the answer of Bertha, Hammond:
"Further answering, on information and belief, the matters
alleged in the three foregoing paragraphs, I say that the said
George W. Hopkins and the testator, John Hopkins, were
partners in trade for years before the death of the latter, and
that their business consisted in the manufacture of bricks, and
that the property mentioned was purchased in the years 1849,
1854, and 1855 for the purposes of their said business and used
for such purposes, so far as required, until the death of the
said John Hopkins, and afterwards, in pursuance of the provisions of his last will and testament, until the youngest child,
Alice, had attained the age of eighteen years, which event
occurred in April, 1864; that until such time the business of
brick-making had continued as before the death of the testator in pursuance of the provisions of his will, but under the
authority thereby conferred it had been necessary to dispose
of some few pieces of ground, the purchase-money whereof
was duly accounted for; that upon the happening of such
event, the period fixed by the will for the division of the estate, the children of the said testator were eager to obtain
their respective shares of the estate; that it was well known
to all the said children that the said George W. Hopkins and
John S. Hopkins proposed to continue the said business, and
to that end to purchase the necessary parcels of ground at the
prices at which tL'e same should sell at public auction; that
the said children were not only willing but desirous that the
business should be continued and the necessary purchase made,
their only interest being in obtaining the best prices; that, in

HAM.M.1OND v. HOPKINS.
Statement of the Case.

order to obtain such prices, the whole title to the property
was sold, as well the interest of the said George W. Hopkins
as of the testator; that the said sale was of the property in
separate parcels and was in all respects fairly conducted, and
that the prices obtained were the full value of the property ;
that the said George W. Hopkins and John S. Hopkins bought
with full, knowledge and consent of the said children and duly
accounted for the purchase-money; that at the time of the
sale of the property, except where the residence of George W.
Hopkins stood in square 111, was a common, the streets of the
city not having been opened, and the kilns for burning bricks
standing on square 94; that there were no circumstances of
suppression or concealment, but the deed to James Chapman,
placed upon record, on its face showed only a nominal consideration, and that all parties interested well knew that said'
Chapman bought for the benefit of the said George W. Hopkins and John S. Hopkins, and that the latter, after the said
purchase, continued the said business with the knowledge and
acquiescence of the said children of the testator until the death
of the said George V. Hopkins, in 1875.'
The answers averred that the account of the trustees and
executors was properly settled in the orphans' court, and
.pleaded in bar the order of that co'urt carried into execution
by the parties interested. The matters in excuse of laches
were denied, and the great length of time, the death of parties
and witnesses, the increase in value of the property, and other
circumstances, were set up as an equitable bar.
July 8, 158, an amendment was filed as to paragraphs ten
and thirteen of the bill. These amendments alleged prearrangement to prevent competition, and that squares 95 and
66 were offered and sold as an entirety and thereby brought a
price far below what they would have brought, if advertised
to be sold and sold in lots; that the time was unpropitious for
a sale, etc., etc.; and that the trustees had appropriated to
themselves part of the personal property belonging to the
brick-kiln business. And notice, either actual or constructive,
of the proceedings in the orphans' court was denied.
These amendments were answered by the principal defend-

ants and the allegations denied, the defences reiterated and the
want of explanation of laches set up.
June 4, 1885, paragraph thirteen of the original bill was
again amended by charging that the order of settlement and
distribution of the orphans' court was fraudulently obtained,
in that neither of the trustees made known to the court the
nature of their trust, if the accounts included the proceeds as
well as the sales of the real estate, nor informed the court of
their fraudulent conduct in regard to the sales, nor that any
notice, either actual or constructive, had been given the complainants of the settlement and distribution of the estate; and
prayed that the order of distribution might be disregarded
and set aside and distribution made of the estate as by law it
should be, and the defendants be prohibited from availing
themselves of the fraudulent settlement and distribution.
Paragraph sixteen was also aiiaended by adding that the
trustees failed to account for the sale of lots 12, 13, 14, 15, 25,
26, 29, and 40, of square 110, and had sold and fraudulently
paid over to George W. Hopkins one-half of the proceeds of
lots 3, 4, and 5, in square 67.
The principal defendants answered these amendments and
traversed their allegations. They admitted the sale of the lots
in square 110, which were made before May 10, 1864, and
averred that the proceeds had been accounted for. They further averred that lots 3, 4, and 5, in square 67, belonged to
George W. and, John S. Hopkins in common; that the said
George W. and John S. Hopkins were partners in the brick-making business prior to 1858, and that these lots were acquired
for the purposes of said business, and were so used by them,
and that the proceeds of -salewere duly accounted for. Replications to all the answers were filed. The .cause came on to
be. heard in special telrm before Mr. Justice Merrick, and the
bill as amended was decreed to be dismissed, with costs. The
opinion appears in the record.
On appeal, the court in general term reversed the decrte of
the special term, and.'adjudged that the sales to Chapman of
May 10, 1864, were fraudulent and void, and that the deeds
from the trustees to Chapman and from Chapman to George

H{AIMOND ,v. HOPKINS.
Statement of the Case.

W. and John S. Hopkins, as individuals, and the deed from
Chapman to George W. Hopkins, individually, were null and
void, and that the same be set aside. It was further adjudged
that the title of the defendants to the real estate remaining
unsold should be divested; and that the defendants should
account to the complainants before the auditor for the purchase moneys arising from all sales made by the trustees of
portions of the real estate bought through Chapman, with
interest; and also for the purchase moneys arising from all
sales made by the defendants; and aho for all rents and profits
received by the defendants. In the account the one-half of
the proceeds of the sale of lots 3, 4, and 5, -quare 67, received
by George W. Hopkins, with interest from June 18, 1872,
was directed to be included. And the decree provided for a
partition or sale of the unsold real estate, with directions to
the auditor as to the mode of dividing the proceeds if a sale
should take place.
From this decree the defendants and each of them prayed
an appeal to this court, whici was allowed.
It appeared from the evidence that George W. Hopkins and
John Hopkins were brothers and copartners in the business of
manufacturing bricks, and for the purposes thereof acquired
and used certain squares of ground in the city of Washington,
on which there were clay deposits. As early as 1846 they
carried on the business on square 67, and in July, 1849, purchased squares Nos. 94, 95, and 96 at a cost of between one
and two cents per square foot. Their office aid stable were
on square No. 9- and their kilns and drying sheds on squares
Nos. 95 antI 96. August 9, 1854, they purchased square 111,
on which was a brick dwelling-house, at the price of five cents
per square foot; and on December 27, 1855, square 110 at two'
cents per square foot. By the deeds for these squares the property was conveyed to the grantees in fee simple as tenants in
common. Immediately after the purchase of square 111,
George W. Hopkins moved into the dwelling-house thereon
and resided there until his death in 1875. On the' 27th of
November, 1858, John Hopkins died, 'leaving the last will and
testament attached to the bill, which was duly admitted to

probate by the orphans' court December 4, 1858; and George
W. and John S. Hopkins qualified thereunder as. executors,
December 14, and the business was conducted as before.
The family of John Hopkins consisted of nine children, one
of whom, Levin, died in 1863, unmarried and intestate, and
his share devolved upon the other children; so that when
Alice attained the age of eighteen, on April 13, 1864, the
estate of John Hopkins was represented by the eight surviving
children, his devisees and next of kin. His estate consisted
mainly of his undivided moiety of squares 94, 95, 96, 110,
and 111.
On Sepiember 16, 1859, George W. Hopkins in his own
right, and h and John S. Hopkins as executors, made a subdivision of the original lots in square 110, and subsequently
sold at different times a number of the subdivision lots. On
April 13, 1864, there were unsold in this square the following
lots: 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42,
43, 44, and 45. John Hopkins'resided in Georgetown at the
time of his death, and his children or some them continued to
reside there until 1862, when they removed to the dwellinghouse on square 111 occupied by their uncle George W. Hopkins. When Alice attained the age of eighteen, the seven
other children were of about the following ages: Isaac H., 40;
Elizabeth A. Early, 39 ;-John S., 37; Emeline V. Lilburn, 36;
.George Washington, 35; William M.. S., 33; Mary V. 25.
Mrs. Lilburn lived in St. Mary's County, Maryland, and Elizabeth A. Early, Mary Victoria, Alice C., John S. and Isaac H.
Hopkins lived with their uncle, George W. William M. S.
and George Washington lived elsex~here in' rashington.
Mary subsequently married one Wailes, and Alice one James
R. Hall.
Under the will, upon the arrival of Alice at the age of
eighteen years the estate was tobe divided, and in order to
do -this it seems. to have been deemed advisable to sell the
undivided moiety of the real estate. The other undivided
moiety belonged to George W. Hopkins, and the trustees and
executors, instead of selling one -moiety, advertised and sold
the whole interest in the property, as well that owned by

George W. as that owned by the estate. The advertisement
bears date the 20th of April, 1864, and advertises the sale at
public auction for the 10th of May following. This advertisement has already been set forth, and under it squares 95 and
96, known as "Hopkins' brick yard," were with the outfit
advertised to be sold as a whole, as was also square 111 with
the dwelling-house and other improvements. At the sale the
trustees purchased the squares 95 and 96 at 4 cents per square
foot; lot No. 1 in square 94 at 10 cents per square foot; and
lots 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 39 in square 110 at 8-1L cents per
square foot. George W. bought square 111 at 9 cents per square
foot. These purchases were made through one James Chapman, who acted on behalf of the purchasers. Lot 6 in square
94 was sold to August Miller at 13 cents per square foot; lots
2, 3, and 4, at 10j- cents; and lot 5 at 14 cents. Lots 8 and 9
in square 110 were sold to James L. Roche at 11 cents per
square foot; lots 10 and 24 to Joseph Gawler at 10 cents; lots
36 and 37, with improvements, at $290 apiece; lots 41, 42, 43,
and 44 to W. C. Longstreth at 6-!-cents per square foot. On
May 20, 1864, the property in question was conveyed by the
trustees to James Chapman, and he on the same day conveyed
to George W. and John S. Hopkins the squares and lots purchased by them jointly, and to George W. the square purchased
by him alone. The deeds were recorded November 16, 1864.
The consideration in the conveyance to Chapman was merely
nominal, one dollar, while the considerations in the deeds from
him recite as paid by the grantees the price for which the
property was purchased at the sale. On August 23, 1864, the
orphans' court passed an order appointing September 13, 186.4,
as the time for the final settlement and distribution of the
personal estate of the testator, and notifying his devisees and
heirs to attend the court on that day. The copy of the order ias
published in accordance with the direction of the court in the
National Intelligencer nine times, commencing August 21 and
ending September 12, 1864.
It appears by the minutes of the court that on- March 28,
1865, the register of wills reported to, the court the first and
final account of the executorg, and the same was approved and

passed by the court, and it was ordered that "the executors
aforesaid make distribution of the assets'in .hand to the heirs
in accordance with the provisions of the will of the deceased."
This account treated the moiety of the proceeds of the sale of
the real estate, including the sale of May, 1864, as partnership
property to be accounted for in the orphans' court as personalty.
In the account the executors charged themselves w{th the
amount of the inventory, a policy of insurance, certain sums
,paid for slaves emancipated in the District, and some items of
interest, etc. The debit account amounted to $24,155.59, and
contained this item: "And with this amount, being one-half
the earnings of firm of J.& G. W. Hopkins in conducting the
brick kiln, owned in part by deceased, from the day of his
death to date of rendering this account, first deducting the
expenses of the family of deceased and other expenses, directed
by the will of said deceased to be defrayed out of said earnings, and also the value of deceased's interest in said firm, as
per affidavit filed with vouchers, $14,952.66." The credits
amounted to $2024.13. No commissions were charged, and
the balance shown was $22,131.46. This was followed by a
distribution account, which, after deducting $8 fees from the
balance $22,131.46, and $782.60 paid .out on specific legacies,
there was left $21,340.86, which was distributed among the
eight surviving children of the decedent, namely: Isaac H.
Hopkins, John S. Hopkins, Elizabeth A. Early, George W.
Hopkins, William, M. S. Hopkins, Emeline V. Lilburn, Mary
V. Hopkins, and George W. and John S. Hopkins in trust for
Alice C. Hopkins, being the sum of $2667.603 each. This
account ivas filed and recorded March 28, 1865, and passed by
order of court.
The affidavit and vouchers mentioned do not appear in the
record, and it is said that-after diligent search they cannot be
found. Within a few days after the passage of the order distribution was made, and the receipts- of the different parties
entitled were delivered by the executors to the register and by
him recorded. The share of William M. S. was receipted for
by John S.; the share of Alice, receipted for.by the executors,
was by them held in trust until she attained the age of twenty-

one, and was afterwards paid to her and her husband. After
the sale of May 10, 1864, George W. and John S. Hopkins
carried on the brick-making business on squares Nos. 95 and 96,
and lot 1, square 94, until as late as 1873, and probably as
1875, when George W. died. After his death JoLn S. filed a
bill for the partition of the property owned in common, the
other lots purchased in common having been sold, and by the
decree of the court below of Febraary 27, 1877, lots 1, 2, 3, 4
and 6, in square 95, and lots 5, 6, 7, $, 9 and 10 and 11 in square
9 were allotted to him in severalty. Lot 1 in square 94,
and lot 5 in square 95, and lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16
in square 96, were allotted to the heirs of George W. Hopkins.
Thereafterwards the children and heirs-at-law of George W.
filed a bill for the payment of his debts and for a partition of
the property allotted to them in the first suit, and also of square
111, where he resided until his death, and a decree was rendered
in which a part of the property was sold for the payment of,.
debts, and the remainder allotted to the heirs-at-law in severalty.
Nearly all of the lots thus allotted had been sold when the bill
in this case was filed. John S. Hopkins, the other trustee, died
intestate May 7, 1883. He left a widow, Esther E. Hopkins,
and an. only child and heir-at-law, Bertha Hopkins, who was
at that time 25 years of age. After the partition between
John S. and the heirs-at-law of George W., John S. built a
row of houses on the lots in square 96 at a considerable cost.
None of the property allotted to him in the partition suit
was sold by him prior to his death, except the east part of
square 95.
As already stated, George W; and John Hopkins in 1846
carried on their business on square 67, and in 1869, after the
death of John Hopkins, a deed was made by Charles E. Mix
to George W. Hopkins and John S., as executors and trustees,
for lots 3, 4 and 5 in said square. These lots were sold And
conveyed by the executors and trustees, June 18, 1872, for
$6784, and of these proceeds George W. received one-half as
copartner, or $3392, and the other half was paid over to the
beneficiaries entitled, who duly receipted for their respective
shares in full of all demands to date. The share of George

Washington Hopkins was receipted for by Mary A. Hopkins,
his administratrik.
June 20, 1860, William M. S. conveyed in fee simple all his
interest in his father's estate to his brother John S. for the consideration, as expressed in the deed, of $3000. This deed was
also signed by Sarah E. Hopkins, the wife of the grantor, and,
was acknowledged on the day of its date by the grantor and
his wife before two justices of the peace, and recorded July 7,
1860. By deed dated January 28, and acknowledged and recorded January 29, 1861, William M. S. conveyed the same
share, with all his property, to Christopher Ingle, in trust for
his wife for life, and then over to his children and himself.

-Mr. Samuel 1. Phillivs and Mr. Samuel Skellabarger (with
whom were -Y. John J. Johnon and .Mr'. J. M.1Wilsom on
the brief) for appellees. The case was argued mainly on the
facts. The following points of law were made in appellees' brief.
Long acquiescence and laches by parties out of possession
are productive of much hardship and injustice to others, and
cannot be excused except by showing some actual hindrance
or impediment caused by the fraud or concealment of the
party in possession, which will appeal to the conscience of the
chancellor. LansdaZe v.Smith, 106 U. S.391.
Without reference to any statute of limitations the courts
have adopted the principle that the delay which will defeat a
recovery must depend upon the particular circumstances of
each case. Harwood v. Railroad Company, 17 Wall. 78.
The party who makes such appeal should set forth in his
bill specifically what were the impediments to an earlier prosecution of his claim, how he came to be so long ignorant of his
rights, and the means used by the respondent to fraudulently
keep him in ignorance, and how and when he first came to a
knowledge of the matters alleged in his bill. Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87.

IIAIIMMOND v. HOPKINS.
Argument for Appellees.

It is a principle of law, as well as of "natural justice, that
greater consideration and care are due to persons known to be
unable to take care of themselves, than to those who are fully
able to do so. Grafan v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 180.
The office of trustee is important to the-community at large,
and frequently most so to those least able to take care of themselves. It is one of confidence; The law regards the incumbent with jealous scrutiny, and frowns sternly at the slightest
attempt to pervert his powers and duties for his own benefit.
Railroad Company v. Durant,95 U. S. 576.
These trustees knew the value of subdivision in securing
good prices at the sale, and nevertheless sold square 111 as a
whole. Such conduct between triustee and cestui que trust
reaches far beyond what was necessary to be proved 'in this
case in order to set the sales aside. When this relation subsists, the slightest obliquity, the slightest- indirection is adequate, on grounds of public policy. Villa v. Rodriguez, 12
Wall. 323; Skaw v. Railroad Co., 100 U. S. 605. IReasonable certainty is all that. is necessary in case of fraud. -emprner v. Churehill,8 Wall. 362;- Yeale v. Neales, 9 Wall. 1; Rea
v. Missouri, 17 Wall. 532; Grafar v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 180.
It was the duty of the trustees in making the sale to exercise. that diligence and caution which a careful and prudent
owner would observe in the sale of his own property. If the
sale be made under circumstances of baste and imprudence,
or if the trustees fail in reasonable diligence in inviting competition, or adopt an injudicious and disadvantageous mode of
selling the property, a court of equity ought not to ratify the
sale. Gould ,v. Chappell, 42 Maryland, 466; Ord v. Noel, 5
Madd. 438; Hlarper v. Hayes, 2 Gif. 210; Turner v. Harvey,.

766.
Although the rule of law, as now firmly settled, is that a
trustee may buy of his cestui que trust, provided there is a
distinct and clear contract to that effect, made under such
circumstances as indicate that the cestui que .trust was aware
of the correct value of the property, that the trustee had no

OCTBER TERMT, 1891.
Argument for Appellees.

special knowledge of the value of the thing bought, which
was not also possessed by the beneficiary, and that no undue
influence arising out of the trusteeship was brought to bear
on the mind of the cestui que trust -in a word, that they
stood at such length to each other as amicable buyer and
seller sustain ordinarily one to the other; yet it has been as
distinctly .decided that the relaxation does not extend to a
purchase by a trustee at his own sale. Such a sale is ipso
facto voidable by the cestui que trust, on ground of public
policy. Lewin on Trusts, 438; .Mickoud v. Girod, 4 How.
503.
Fullness of price, absence of fraud, and fairness of sale are
not sufficient to countervail this rule of policy. Armstrong v.
Huston, 8 Ohio, 552; 1icketts v. Wkittington, 15 Maryland,
46; Jamison v. Glascock-, 29 Missouri, 191; Woodruf v.
Cooke, 2 Edw. Oh. 259; Sindler v. Atkinson, 3 Maryland,
409; S. C. 56 Am. Dec. 755.
The theory of the defence is that these cestuis q? e trustent
are guilty of laches in not investigating and discovering these
frauds. They assert in their answers and attempt to prove in
their evidence there was no fraud, and although asserting this
innocency, they claim negligence for not finding out what
they say did not exist. But the law is that the office of trustee is an important one-an office of trust and confidence;
one in which the weak and incompetent may find shelter and
protection. It is the duty df the trustee to execute the trust,
and it is not the duty of the cestui que trust to make any
inquiries. Taylor v. Taylor, 8 How. 183, 200; Dresser v.
.Missouri & Iowa, Railway Construction Co., 93 U. S. 92;
Graftoam. v. Burgess, ubi sup.; .Dorsey v. Packwood, 12 How.

U. S. 506, 512; Zeller v. Eckert, 4 How. 288, 295.
It is sought to prove a consent by the cestuis que truste t
to the purchaser by the trustees. But the alleged consent was
not such a consent as the law contemplates. The cestuis que
trustent were merely passive, and such an action is not consent,
as expressly decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
in the case of Paul v. Squibb, 12 Penn. St. 296. Confirma-

tion must be a solemn and deliberate act, Lewin on Trusts, 450;
no suqgestiofalsi,no .tppressio veri: and not fished out from
loose expressions. Carpenter v. Heriot, 1 Eden, 338.
No laches can be claimed by reason of the relationship between the parties: no acquiescence or ratification of illegal or
unlawful acts, spelt out by the most equivocal and uncertain
testimony of more equivocal and uncertain acts testified to.

The settlement in the orphans' court was no estoppel. That
court had no jurisdiction over the distribution of equitable
assets or real estate. Robertson v. Pickrell, 109 U. S. 608.
The interest of John Hopkins in these squares was real estate.
Nor was the receipt of the distributive share allowed in the
settlement an estoppel. Embry v, Palmer,. 107 U. S. 3;

The plaintiff, Sarah E. Hopkins, being a married woman,
no laches can be charged against her. House v. Aiulle n, 22
Wall. 42.
These sales being fraudulent, a court of equity will not allow
the trustees or their heirs to reap any advantage from their
scheme, but will set the sales aside ab initio,and hold them to
an account for the profits which they have made - doing equity,
however, to them, which they refused to others, in: allowing
them credit for their lawful expenditures, as improvements,
taxes and payments to the appellees with interest thereon.

which had in the meantime been made in their vicinity.
No rule of law is better settled than that a court of equity
will not aid a party whose application is destitute of conscience,
good faith and reasonable diligence, but will discourage stale
demands, for the peace of society, by refusing to interfere where
there have been gross laches in prosecuting rights, or where
long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights has occurred.
The -rule is peculiarly applicable where the difficulty of doing
entire justice arises through the death of the principal participants in the transactions complained of, or of the witness or
witnesses, or by reason of the original transactions having become so obscured by time as to render the ascertainment of
the exact facts impossible. Each case must necessarily be governed by its own circumstances, since, though the lapse of a
few years may be sufficient to defeat the action in one case,
a longer period may be held requisite in another, dependent
upon the situation of the parties, the extent of their knowledge
or means of information, great changes in values, the want of
probable grounds for the imputation of intentional fraud, the
destruction of specific testimony, the absence of any reasonable
impediment or hindrance to the assertion of the alleged rights,
and the like. -Marskv. Wkitmore, 21 Wall. 178; Landsdale

Chapman, on the ground of constructive, coupled with actual,
fraud.
Undoubtedly the doctriiu6 is established that a,trustee cannot
purchase or deal in the trust property for his wn benefit or
on his own behalf, directly or indirectly. But such a purchase
is not absolutely void. It is only voidable, and as it may be
confirmed by the parties interested, directly, so it may be by
long acquiescence or the absence of an election to avoid the
conveyance within a reasonable time after the facts come to
the knowledge of the cestui que trust.
The often cited case of .lichoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, laid
down the general rule that a person cannot purchase legally on
his own account that which his duty or trust requires him to
sell for another, nor purchase on account of another that which
he sells on his own account, and that a purchase, per interpositarin pesona, by a trustee or agent of the particular property
of which he has the sale; or in which he represents another,
whether he has an interest in it or not, carries fraud on the
face of it; but there was actual fraud in that case, and the
rule that within what time a constructive trust will be barred
must depend upon the circumstances was recognized. In
Stearns v. Page, 7 How.. 819, 829, Mr. Justice Grier, speaking for the court, said that a complainant, seeking the aid of a
court of chancery under such circumstances of lapse of time as
there existed, "must state in his bill distinctly the particular
act of fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment -must specify
how, when, and in what 'manner it was perpetrated. The
charges must be definite and reasonably certain, capable of
proof, and clearly proved. If a mistake is alleged, it must be
stated with precision, and made apparent, so that the court
may rectify it with a feeling of certainty that they are not
committing another, and perhaps greater, mistake. And especially must there be distinct averments as to the time when
the fraud, mistake, concealment or misrepresentation was discovered, and what the discovery is, so that the court may clearly
see, whether, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, the discovery might not have been before made. Every case must,
of course, depend on its own peculiar circumstances, and there

would be little profit in referring to the very numerous cases to
be found in the books on this subject. In the case of .Micoud,
v. Girod, 4 How. 503, lately decided in this court, transactions
were investigated after a lapse of more than twenty years;
but the facts proving the fraud were all on record, and were
not disputed. The false accounts made out against the estate
of the deceased by the executors were on file, and their iniquity
was apparent on their face. Moreover, the complainants resided in Europe and were kept in ignorance of their rights,
and hindered from prosecuting them by the promises, threats
and fraud of the guilfv parties."
And in Badger v ,adger, 2 Wall. 87, 95, the same eminent
judge observed that a party seeking to avoid laches "'should
set forth in his hill specifically what were the impediments to
an earlier prosecution of his claim; how he came to be so long
ignorant of his i1iglits, and the means used by the respondent
to fraudulently keep him in ignorance; and how and when he
first came to a knowledge of the matters alleged in his bill;
otherwise the chancellor may justly refuse to consider his case,
on his own showing, without inquiring whether there is a
demurrer or formal plea of the statute of limitations contained
in the answer.'
It is conceded that the proposition that where a trustee or
person, acting for others, sells the trust estate and becomes
himself interested in the purchase, the cestuis gue trust are
entitled as of course to have the purchase set aside, is subject
to the qualification that the application for such relief must
be made within a reasonable time, and that laches and long
acquiescence cannot be excused except by showing some actual
hindrance or impediment caused by the fraud or concealment
of the party in possession, which will appeal to the conscience
of the chancellor. But it is argued that such fraud and concealment existed here, and in that connection assertions and
insinuations of fraud in fact are made.
Appellees' counsel contend that, although George W. Hopkins and John S. Hopkins were men of character and integrity, yet they were good business men, and that John S. was
self-reliant, reticent and close in money matters, while the four

daughters were unaccustomed to business, and of the other
three sons, two were dissipated and one lacked busipess capacity; that the family was a united one, and entire confidence
was reposed in the uncle and brother, and hence the trustees
might easily have cheated their cestuis que trust:
That the trustees had full knowledge of the future value of
the property and desired to possess themselves of it at the
lowest possible price, and, therefore, determined not to divide
by partition, but to sell; and purposely sold at a time when
the real estate market was prostrated and the building business so depressed that there was no demand for bricks, notwithstanding they had ample power to change the time of
sale if circumstances rendered it necessary or desirable; and
advertised and sold squares 95 and 96 as a brick yard as a
means of reducing the price, although the property was worthless as a-brick yard and there was no demand for bricks, or for
real estate in large quantities; and that these 'squares were
sold as an entirety in order to enable the trustees to buy at a
less price than a sale by subdivision would have produced, and
in this way a loss occurred of not less than $15,930.87; that
square 111 was sold as an entirety, when it should have been
sold in lots, and this resulted in a loss of $6061.98; that the
difference between what these squares actually realized and
what they should have, was not less than $22,092.85, or a loss
to the eight heirs of John Hopkins of $11,046.42 :
That "these were frauds prepetrated secretly under such
circumstances of confidence inspired by the trustees, as to
prevent these owners from discovering them," and this is alleged to be established; (a) By the employment of Chapman
to make the purchase; (b)by the deed to Chapman reciting a
consideration of one dollar, and the deed of Chapman to
George W. Hopkins, "having the false recital" that Chapman
had sold him square 111 for $9093.42, and that to George W.
and John S., "having the false recital" that Chapman had
sold to them squares 95 and 96, and parts of 94 and 110, for
$10,42.24; (c) by the fact that the deeds were not recorded
until November 16, 1864:
That in order to "give a semblance of judicial sanction to

their acts and further deceive appellees," the trustees went
into the orphans' court, and by exp arte proceedings had their
account passed upoi, although the court had no jurisdiction:
And further, that appellees were ignorant of the purchase
of the property by the trustees until so informed by their attorney a few days before the institution of this suit; that it
had been represented to them that a bricklayer had bought it
of whom their uncle and brother had subsequently purchased;
and that it was represented to them by the trustees that the
sale was bona fde, and that the property had brought all it
was worth at the time. It is insisted that the evidence discloses an actual hindrance and impediment to the appellees'
discovering their rights, caused by the fraudulent assertions of
the trustees that the property brought its full price, and that
the sale was particularly conducted for the interest of the
heirs. And it is earnestly urged that when the confidential
relation of trusteeship and kinship exists, if the trustees and
kinsmen inform those for whom they act that their administration has been honest and faithful, when that is not the
fact, that constitutes such fraudulent concealment as excuses
laches.
It will be perceived that the main charge of fraud in fact
consists in an alleged conspiracy to obtain the property for less
than it was worth. The claims that the sale was fixed at an
unpropitious time and that the squares should have been subdivided and sold in lots, go to the adequacy of the price. If
there were no such conspiracy, the specific charge falls to the
ground, and if all the circumstances relied on to sustain it were
actually known or the appellees were chargeable with such
knowledge, then it comes too late. And if they were fully
informed that the trustees purchased, and the latter made no
false representations in relation to the sale, which misled
them, the attempted explanation of the lapse of time as bearing on the purchase by the trustees themselves also fails.
We can hardly see how appellees can now be permitted to
plead ignorance as to the time and manner of the sale, the
prices brought, the deeds to and frofih Chapman, and the settlement of the account. And if they are held to knowledge

•HAMMOND v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.

on these points, the question in either aspect becomes reduced
to the inquiry whether they knew or might have known that
the trustees purchased the property, or were kept in ignorance
by any false representations. But in answering this inquiry it
is perhaps desirable to look somewhat into the basis of these
charges.
We do not understand it to be contended that the trustees
were bound to carry the John Hopkins half, or attend to the
support of his children, or any of them, out of the brick business or otherwise, indefinitely.
By his will, after certain bequests, John Hopkins had devised his property to his brother and son in trust, "to carry on
the brick-making business as now conducted by my said brother
George W. Hopkins and myself in Washington City, D. C.,
said business to be under the direction of my said brother,
George W. Hopkins, assisted by my said son, John S. Hopkins, as clerk, for whih he is to receive a regular stated salary;" and further, to receive the income of the estate and
business or the testator's portion, and apply the same to the
payment of his debts and funeral expenses; of'a reasonable
salary to John S. Hopkins, as clerk; and the reasonable expenses and support of the testator's family and the education
of the younger members thereof. "And upon further trust,
that my said trustees shall (where, in th*eir judgment a sale of
the real property owned by me and my said brother, George
W. Hopkins, or any part thereof, or of the brick-kilns and the
materials or implements thereunto belonging, or of said business, is essential or necessary for any cause whatever or would
be advantageous) sell and dispose of at public or private sale,
at such time or times after such notice and upon such terms 'as
they may deem most for the interest of my estate, and by
proper conveyances c6nvey the same to the purchasers, wh6,
havingpaid his or her purchase money to my said executors,
shall be under no obligation to see to the application thereof
under the trust of this, my will, nor. answerable for the misapplication of the same." Surplus income and proceeds of sales
were to be reinvested, or advanced to such of the children as
might need or deserve the same. And the will further pro-

vided "that upon the arrival of my daughter Alice to the age
of eighteen years, which will occur on or about the first day of
M-ay, 1864, my estate of every kind shall be divided by my said
trustees and executors among my children.".
But the trustees were invested with power to make an earlier disposition in their discretion, as above shown, and by the
further clause:
"I greatly desire, as already stated, that my family shall
remain as it now is, without change or modification or sale or
valuation of the furniture or slaves until the said division of
my estate, and that it shall until then be supported by the
brick-kiln business as though I were living, and as I believe
the squares and lots of ground owned by my brother George and
myself, is now and will continue to increase in value, I desire,
if possible, that said land may be kept unsold and undivided
until as above stated, as it will thus be greatly to the advantage of my family; but as circumstances, now unforeseen, may
make a change necessary or desirable, I cheerfully trust in the
prudence and discretion of .my said trustees, and I give them
full power as above to exercise their judgment as circumstances
may arise, making it proper to dispose of said land and business, or to change and alter the same, believing that they will
have the comfort and welfare of my family and their relatives
much at heart."
I It is unnecessary to consider the rights and powers of George
W. Hopkins as surviving partner. The trust was accepted,
the business carried on, the children assisted and supported,
and the land kept unsold and undivided, (except certain lots
in square 110, which were disposed of in 1859,) "until as abQve
stated," that is, until Alice attained the age of eighteen, which
was April 13, 1864, when it became the duty of the trustees to
divide the testator's estate of every kind among his children.
To divide this real estate required a partition as between
George W. and the estate, and thereupon a partition of their
half as between the testator's children. To sell an undivided
half would probably prove disadvantageous, but if George W
allowed his half to be sold with the other so that complete
title could be given without subsequent legal proceedings, the

HAMMOND v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.

trustees apparently concluded 'a sale would be the best mode
of arriving at a division. It is impossible to say that there
was anything unreasonable in such a conclusion.
There is nothing, then, in the trustees dividing at the time
specified by the testator, and resolving to do this by the ordinary method of a sale, which gives color to the charge of conspiracy.
Squares 95, 96 and part of 94 were used in the brick business, and George W. Hopkins lived on square 111. He owned
one-half of these squares, and it was natural that he should
desire to own the whole of his homestead, and that he and his
nephew should wish to own all that portion used in the business in which they were engaged. But it is not, therefore,
to be assumed that in the gratification of their wishes in this
regard they would commit deliberate fraud upon the brothers
and sisters of the one and the nephews and nieces of the
other. It is not denied that George W. and John S. Hopkins
were honest and reliable and sustained a high reputation for
integrity; and if fraud or breach of trust ought not lightly to
be imputed to the living, the evidence of fraud should be convincing before the sanctity of the grave 'is disturbed. Yet
here the stress of the argument that the deceased were guilty
is thrown upon the alleged inadequacy of price claimed to
have been the result of selling squares 95 and 96 as an entirety
and square 111 in the same way. That they brought full
prices as squares is satisfactorily established by.the evidence,
and scarcely disputed.
The condition of the squares in that part of the city, including squares 94, 95, 96, 110, and 111, in May, 1864, is described by one of appellees' witnesses as just laid out "in old
fields, as it were; you could hardly tell one street from another. Very rarely you would see any improvement on any
of them, unless it were some old shanty which had been built
there probably thirty or forty years.

squares were pretty much set out in nurseries, you will remember, but I do not think any nurseries were on these squares at
that time. I think they laid out in a common. Q. Were the
streets graded? -A. I think not; I do not think there were

any streets graded there. Q. How many houses can you recollect in the neighborhood of what is, now known as Dupont
Circle? A. There were very few houses in that neighborhood.
I want to state that there were very few. George Hopkins's
house was there at the time, but houses were very scarce, I tell
you. There may have been some old landmarks torn away
that may have escaped my memory, but the whole place laid
out in old fields and commons. I cannot recall any houses,
but farther out, near the boundary, there were some houses.
I remember a house right at the head of Twentieth Street. It
is there still. Well, they were scattered, around; probably you
would have to walk two or three squares to find houses.
Q. Were there any pathways to get to the houses? A. I
think there was a road which led to Holmead's burying
ground, a kind of highway known as the burying-ground
road. I'went out that road when I was in that part of the
city; but, as for squares, I do not think anybody could tell
one square from another by going there, so far as distinguisbing them by roads or anything of that kind is concerned."
Other evidence is to the effect that in 1866 and 1867 thern
were no streets open running north of K and west of Fourteenth Streets except Twentieth Street; that no street had been
brought to anything like an established grade at that time,
though Twentieth Street was graded a portion of, and perhaps
all, the way; that none of the streets running east and west
were opened in that locality west of Seventeenth or Eighteenth
Streets except a portion of L Street; that no streets north of
L Street were opened on any established grade across Twen-tieth Street; that M Street was very nearly on the grade about
Twentieth Street, but not at Twenty-first Street; that there
were scarcely any blocks or any of the streets opened north of
L and west of Fourteenth Streets in that portion of the city in
1867, and Massachusetts Avenue had not been opened, nor
P, nor 0 Streets; that the property in that section of the city
west of Dupont Circle, "a good deal of it, or some of it, was
enclosed and used for cultivation, for pasturage; a portion of
it was used for the manufacture of brick, and other portions
were laid out in pasturage for hogs and cows and goats, etc.

HAMMOND v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.
.

A person could tell about where the streets were, but

not by any defined lines. There were roads passing here and
there up Massachusetts Avenue, which was barely passable.
There was no bridge over Slash Run at Massachusetts Avenue."
There were no water mains nor sewers. Brick kilns were on
square 95, and sheds and yards for drying bricks were on
square 96. The surface of the squares was rough and irregular and full of holes made in digging for brick clay. One witness said that in the middle of those squares "you might have
buried 'Jumbo,' and you could not see him." How far the
squares might be above grade when the streets were opened
seems to have been regarded as in doubt, notwithstanding the
books of the surveyor's office gave the future grades.
It was in proof that the manufacture of brick was carried
on there "until 1872 or 1873 ;" and that square 96 was "1used
for digging clay for the manufacture of brick, in 1867, 1868,
and 1869, along about that time." The principal witnesses
concur that the business of brick making was carried on after
the sale as it had been before.
Evidence was adduced on behalf of appellees tending to
show that there was but little brick clay on these squares after
1864; that the concern gathered it from the streets; that the
two kilns on square 95 were old and out of shape; and that
the brick the Hopkins made was too soft for pavements. But
the fact remains that the brick business was carried on upon
these squares for years after the sale. They were thus advertised as a "brick yard, believed to be one of the best located
in the District, having both Washington and Georgetown for
a market, an abundance of fine clay, brick and tempering
sheds, kilns, offices and all necessary outfit for a first-class
brick yard."
There is evidence of probable ground for the belief that the
squares would in any view bring better prices by being sold in
blocks; .ut apart from that, we think the inference of bad
faith because they were sold as a brick yard, a strained one.
Conceding that the judgment of the trustees was influenced
by their own intention to continue the business, that is not
enough to sustain the assumption of actual fraud in the matter

OCTOBER TERI, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

of the prices. And the knowledge of the parties now complaining, of the continuance of the business, is admitted. So,
as to square 111, that was advertised as "improved by a large
brick dwelling-house and back buildings, carriage-houses, stabling, etc., the whole enclosed and beautified with fruit and
ornamental trees and shrubbery."
The reason is thus given for selling it as an entirety, and it
was an obvious one. As we have said, it was George W.
Hopkins's home, and most of the children of his brother John
were living there with him. He naturally desired to own it,
not for subdivision, but for a residence. The house is shown
not to have materially enhanced the value; and the price of
nine cents per square foot was a full price. Several years after
he did subdivide a part of this square, and sold the lots constituting the north half for eleven cents per square foot. This
was nearly five years after the sale. The first subdivision of
six of the original lots was August 6, 1868, and the second, of
the remaining six, was November 7, 1870.
The Board of Publio Works created by the act of Congress
of February 21, 1871, thereafterwards opened up and reclaimed the territory in this quarter of the city, and many
thousands of dollars were imposed in special assessments upon
all this property and paid by the owners. The Property had
increased in value between its original purchase and the sale
to a considerable extent, as the prices at the sale showed, but
twenty years thereafter these values had increased several
thousand per cent. Square 96 was not subdivided until
October 20, 1877, more than thirteen years after the sale.
Undoubtedly the argument is ingenious and forcible, that

squares 94, 95 and 96 were of about the same value, and that
if the lots in square 94 brought a higher price per square foot,
the lots in the other squares, if subdivided, would have done
so also; but considerable differences between square 94 and
the others are shown, and it appears that the five lots in 94,
purchased at the .sale by August Miller, were then occupied
by him as a gaiden; and upon the issue of fraud in fact an
intentional attempt to acquire the property at an inadequate
price cannot safely be inferred upon equivocal and conflicting

HAMMOND v. HOP&NS.
Opinion of the Court.

theories as to why one piece sold at a better price than
another. Taking all the evidence together, even if, it were
now seen that if the brick business had been abandoned and
the property subdivided, more might have been realized,. fraud
is not to be imputed because this was not done.
No exception seems to be taken for want of publicity in
the sale. The advertisement was published in the National
Intelligencer, the Evening Star and the Daily Chronicle from
April 20, 1864, to May 10, 1864, daily. The sale was conducted by J. C. McGuire & Co., an established firm in the
conduct of such sales in 1864, and apparently by Thomas J.
Fisher, then a member of the firm, who, however, by reason
of the lapse of time and through the distractions of a large
business, testified that he did not have the slightest recollection of making it. The proofs indicate that there were many
persons present and more than one bid, perhaps three. An
account of the sale to Chapman and others and the prices
realized appeared in the Star the next evening.
The deeds to Chapman were for a nominal consideration,
while the consideration in each of the deeds from Chapman to
George W. and John S. jointly, and to George W., was the
aggregate amount for which Chapman had bid in the property described in the deeds respectively. They were all simultaneously recorded on the 16th of November following, and
spoke for themselves, .carrying upon their face the evidence of
the transaction as being a purchase by the trustees through
Chapman. Thus viewed, their recitals were not false. If the
consideration in the deed to Chapman had been the amount
of his bids there would have been more ground for such a
suggestion. It was the trustees who paid, and the deeds
showed it according to the fact. The delay in recording the
deeds is of no moment. If the evidence shows, as we think
it does, that the purchase was openly announced in the family
of George W. and John, it would be unreasonable to ascribe
to them the motive of concealment in neglecting to record
the deeds before they did. The argument as to confidence
reposed is inconsistent with such an idea, and meditated fraud
would have put the conveyances on record at once.

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

It is said that the accounting in the orphans' court was had
in order to "farther deceive appellees." We find that on the
12th of July, 1864, citation ivas issued against the executors
to settle an account, and that dn the 23d of August the court
appointed the 13th of the succeeding September for the final
settlement and distribution of the personal estate of the deceased, and issued the "requisite legal order for publication to
be inserted once a week for three weeks in the National Intelligencer prior to said day, which was accordingly done. No
proceedings took place on September 13, 1864, and on January
7, 1865, another citation was ordered to be issued against
George W. Hopkins, which was, however, as was the first one,
returned without service. On March 28 the accounting was
had, as hereinbefore stated. Perhaps there was undue delay
in this accounting, but the proceedings in court were regularly conducted and the shares of the devisees ascertained and
duly receipted for by them. The account shows that the proceeds of the business and of the sales prior to May 10, 1864,
were included, though not itemized; and it is certainly too
late to open up that account as such, and especially in the
-absence of evidence of any fraudulent charges or omissions.
Indeed, the account can hardly be said to be attacked on any
ground inherent in itself, but simply in order to obviate its
operation as a settlement, precluding any further investigation of the matters complained of. The executors accounted
for half the proceeds from the sale as personalty, treating the
real estate as having been acquired and used for partnership
purposes and as being partnership property. We are at a loss
to conceive how the conspiracy charged is sustained in any
degree by the mbre fact that the executors accounted.
It appears also that after the conveyance by Chapman to
George" W. and John S. Hopkins as individuals, they conveyed, between July 26, 1865, and March 4, 1871, by four
separate deeds, lots 16, 19, 39 and 17, in square 110, to different purchasers, and that the first, second and fourth of these
purported to be given by them as executors, while the third
did not. These deeds were drawn by the same scrivener who
had been in the habit of preparing deeds for George W. and

HAAIMI\ ) v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.

John S. Hopkins, as executors, before the sale. Between the
dates of the first and last of these four deeds, George W. Hopkins, as an individual, conveyed a number of lots in square
111, in which John S. Hopkins did not join, and between the
date of the fourth deed and April 30, 1875, George W. and
John S. Hopkins, as individuals, conveyed by four separate
deeds, at different times, four lots in square 110 to different
purchasers, while George W. Hopkins between the same dates
conveyed a number of lots in square 111. We think the form
of the three deeds was obviously a blunder of the conveyancer,
and that it cannot rightly be laid hold of as showing that
the deeds were intentionally so drawn to conceal the fact
that George W. and John S. Hopkins owned the property
therein named as individuals, or that they purposely, for that
reason, continued to deal with portions of the real estate
they had purchased, as if they still held it as executors and
trustees.
We are brought, then, to consider whether appellees were
ignorant of the purchase of the p-operty by the trustees, and
whether there were any false representations on their part
which misled them.
George *Washington Hopkins and Isaac H. Hopkins were
at the sale, and Mrs. Lilburn, Mrs. Wailes, Mrs. Early and Alice
were at the house of George W. at the time it took place, Mrs.
Lilburn having been sent for to come up. The National
Intelligencer was taken at the house, and the advertisement
had been read, ceitainly, by M1rs. Early, some time before.
George Washington said to :. witness, while Chapman was
bidding: "He is buying for Uncle George;" and -Isaac H.
was "the first to come in from the sale; and he said that
Chapman. had bought the .,property for Uncle George W.
Hopkins and John, and he said, they had paid as much for iA
as the property was worth." The subject of the sale, and
that George W. and John 8. would purchase, was, frequently
talked over as well before as after the sale, and the evidence
demonstrates that there was no secrecy or concealment
about it.
The ihteresting fact is testified to by appellees' solicitor that

he brought to the attention of his clients the case of Landsdale v. Smith, 106 U. S. 391, and that he "read to them the
rule of law that, in order to excuse long delay in the prosecution of a suit, it must be shown by the plaintiff that the delay
was caused by some hindrance, iinpediment or ,concealment
of a 'party in possession. I think I read it over tb them half
a dozen times and tried to explain it to them." In that case
it is stated : "It has been a recognized doctrine of courts in
equity, from the very beginning of their jurisdiction, to withhold relief from those who have delayed for an unreasonable
length of time in asserting their claims. In Wagner v. Baird,

laches by parties out of possession are productive of much
hardship and injustice to others, and cannot be excused but by
showing some actual hindrance or impediment, caused by the
fraud or concealment of the party in possession, which will
appeal to the conscience of the chancellor."'
Nevertheless, although thus admonished, the testimony of
the four sisters, Mrs. Early, Mrs. Lilburn, Mrs. Wailes, and
Mrs. Hall, (who appeared to be intelligent and well educated,)
if treated as competent, falls far short of overthrowing the evidence on the part of the defendants that they were acquainted
with the fact that the purchase was made for the trustees.
No one can carefully peruse their evidence without being
impressed with the belief that they were aware of that fact.
Three of them testified that they knew their uncle and brother
had become purchasers of the property from a bricklayer, or
Chapman, who bought at the sale, not that they did not know
or hear that he bought for the trustees. Mrs. Hall, who was
but just eighteen at the time, denied that she knew who bought
the property until March, 1884, but-said that she had no doubt
that if she had applied to her uncle or brother for information
in regard to the estate they would have given it. Mr. Luttrell
testifies that in 1876 she told him that Chapman bought for
George W. and John S., and in 1867 and 1868 she, or her hus.band for her, received and receipted for the full amount of
her share, (which under the will was not to be paid over until
she reached twenty-one,) on an account rendered. All these

complainants saw the brick yard being carried on as before,
and George W. and John S. continuing to exercise acts of
ownership over the property. They all had no doubt that
either of the trustees would have given them any information
they desired, and they all evidently had no objection to the
trustees'becoming the purchasers in and of itself.
The following is from the testimony of Mrs. Early:
"Q. I understand you now to say that you would not have
objected to George W. and John S. Hopkins buying the property had they given a fair price for it? A. No, sir; I would
not have objected to it. Q. And your whole complaint is
that you were told they did not give a fair price for it? A.
That justice was not done us. Q. I understand your complaint now is that George W. and John S. Hopkins did not
give a fair price, for what they bought? A. Well, I think
they got as much as they could for. the sale at the time. Q.
You had no objection, as you stated yesterday, to George W.
and John S. Hopkins buying it? A. No, sir. Q. And you
did not care who bought the property so that you got a fair
price for it? A. No, sir."
The force of this admission is attempted to be broken by a
letter to Mrs. Early from her attorneys, calling her attention
to her answer as to the trustees getting as much as they could
at the time, and among other things notifying her "that
unless this statement was a mistake, honestly made, and as
honestly corrected, we shall feel obliged to ask the court when
the case shall be called for hearing, to consider us as no longer
counsel for your interest;" and her reply that she meant
"what I thought the day of the sale, but since then I do not
think they got as much as they could for the property," etc.
This correspondence may have soothed the susceptibilities
of counsel, but it is not evidence, and if it were, it fails to
remove the impression that M rs. Early believed that a full
price was realized.
It will subserve no useful purpose to go meore minutely into
the evidence. We regard the conclusion as irresistible, that
the fact that the purchase was made for and by the trustees
was known to all of these children at or about the time of the
sale.

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

The excuses for want of diligence in the premises set fotth
in the bill amount only to this-that in February, 1884, an
attorney undertaking the investigation of William's case,
which had been in hand since 1873, "discovered for the first
time that Chapman had never paid one dollar of consideration
for said land, but had bought the same for and on account of
said trustees, and that the sale was fraudulent and void;" and
that thereupon the plaintiffs' attention was called to this socalled discovery. The point seems to be that 6omplainants'
counsel concluded from the conveyances, as he very well
might, that the trustees had bought at -their own sale. This
was true, and was an obvious deduction from the deeds, but
it did not therefore follow that" those conveyances were absolutely void, nor that they could be held so nineteen years after
they were executed, if the complainants had known or should
have known that fact during the intervening time, or a large
part of it.
Whether appellees were informed, before 1884, of the rule
in relation to trustees purchasing at their own sale, is immaterial. Probably George W. and John S. Hopkins were unacquainted with it, and made the purchase through Chapman
because obliged to in order to pass the legal title. The vital
question is, Did appellees actually know, or were they chargeable with knowledge of, the fact of the purchase itself ?
What we have said in effect disposes of the suggestion that
by false representations appellees were misled into believing
that the sale was fairly conducted when it was not, and that
this constitutes a sufficient explanation of the lapse of time.
The bill averred that George W. Hopkins assured Mrs.
Lilburn, when -she expressed surprise that the property had
brought so low a price, that the sales were "each and all
bona )de." But the testimony of Mrs. Lilburn was not quite
that. She testified that when her uncle came in from the sale,
she remarked to him: "' Uncle George, is the land all sold?'
He said: ' es.' I said: ' You did not get but very little for
it.' He said: 'No; it was a bona-jXde sale.'" In addition to
this, counsel refer to the evidence of Mrs. Dashiell on crossexamination, where she said that she understood the property

Opinion of the Court.

brought its full value, and a great many people thought it
brought more, and was asked: "Q. It was looked upon, then,
as a sale particularly conducted for the interests of the. heirs?
A. Yes, sir; it was;" and of the widow of John S. Hopkins,
that, "My uncle, George W. Hopkins, and my husband, John
S. Hopkins, told the family that they were going to buy the
brick-yard property; that they would give as much for it as
any one else ; and none of them objected at all ;" and that of
other witnesses, that there was no dissatisfaction expressed
and no suspicion entertained.
Upon testimony of this kind, we cannot hold that either of
these deceased trustees made statements with the view to induce their cestuis que trust to act upon them, or that appellees
were lulled into repose by any affirmative conduct on their
part. Still less does this class of evidence tend to show an
effort to conceal from appellees that the trustees had purchased at their own sale.
By the amendment made in June, 1885, these trustees were
charged with fraudulently appropriating one-half of the proceeds of lots 3, 4 and 5 of square 67, known as the Mix lots,
to the benefit of one of them. The evidence showed that
John and George W. Hopkins carried on the business of brickmaking on square 67, using the clay derived therefrom, before they occupied squares 94, 95 and 96, and that the brick
business had been carried on on that square, before their
occupancy, by a firm, one of whom was named Mix. It further appeared that John Hopkins had been engaged in business on his individual account and had failed, and that he
had had transactions in which George W. was not interested.
And one of his daughters, Mrs. Early, testified, under objection, to a conversation between her father, John Hopkins,
shortly before his death, and Mr. Mix, in which Mix told
Hopkins that he would give him a deed for some lots. On
October 27, 1869, Charles E. Mix and wife, for the nominal
consideration of $5, conveyed to George W. and John S. lots
3, 4 and 5 in square 67 in fee simple, "in trust, nevertheless, to have and to hold the same for the benefit of the
estate of the late John Hopkins, upon like trusts and con-

vested in the said parties of the second part under and by virtue of the last will and testament of the late John Hopkins."

Latta said lots. 3, 4 and 5 for $6784. On July 1, 1873,
John S. gave to Mrs. Early a paper written by hiniself, containing a statement by the trustees of the sale of these lots.
This paper was as follows:

Prior to this date, two of the nine children of John Hopkins, namely, Levin and Isaac, had died intestate and without
issue, and the other seven children were the beneficiaries
under the will. , According to this account rendered, one-half
of the sum.for which the lots had been sold to Latta went to
George W. and the other half to John Hopkins's estate; and
the half of John Hopkins was divided by seven, giving the
share of each of the children as $503.29. October 11, 1873,
Mrs. Early was paid her share and on the sameday signed the

died intestate, and July 9, 1870, letters of administration had
been issued on his estate to Mary A. Hopkins. October 1,
1873, Mary A. Hopkins, the administratrix, gave a similar
receipt for George's share of the proceeds, $503.29. December 2, 1873, William K. S. signed the following receipt:
"Rlec'd of Geo. W. & J. S. Hopkins, executors and administrators on John Hopkins's estate, five hundred and three dolls, in full of all demands due me from the said estate Aind
also in full of any or all demands due me from the said parties above-mentioned up to this'date -Dec. 2d, 1873.

George W. and John S. Hopkins have passed away and,
therefore, cannot explain the reasons for their action in thus
treating these lots as belonging to the copartnership, but they
were coiiversant with the facts and must be regarded as having acted understandingly upon that basis. The square was
used by the partnership for partnership purposes, and it is not
a violent presumption that these lots were purchased with
partnership finds. The question on this branch of the case is,
,vhether 'by bill filed fifteen years after Mix and his wife gave
their deed, and eleven years after the distribution just stated,
the heirs of the trustees ought to be held to account for the
other half of the proceeds upon the ground that the lots belonged to John Hopkins individually. In our judgment such
a conclusion is inadmissible under the circumstances.
The bill averred that the conveyance of William M. S. and
his wife to h'is brother John S., executed June 20, 1860, and
recorded July 7, 1860, was fraudulent and void, and procured
in pursuance of a general scheme of fraud on the part of th4.
trustees. William was not a party to the suit, but by tlb
decree the deed seems to have been ignored, and Sarah E.
Hopkins, William's wife, treated as assignee of his share. It
is admitted that William signed this deed and delivered it to
his brother, and we think it cannot be properly claimed that
he was at the time mentally incompetent to execute it. It is

true he was in the GoVernment Hospital from August 13,
1864, to September 2, 1864, and from January 19 to March
23, 1865, and also from September 19, 1868, to August 6,
1870, for dipsomania, the last time being after he had received a blow on the head; but there is much evidence that
he was a man of intelligence and business capacity when not
under the -influence of liquor, and if there were any mental
failure after September, 1868, that is not material here. He
was called as a witness on behalf of compla.inants, and testified that his brother persuaded him to sign the deed; that he
did not acknowledge it; that he signed his wife's name to .it
at the suggestion of his brother; and that she never knew
about it. January 28, 1864, William conveyed to Christopher
Ingle, for the benefit of his wife, all his interest in his father's
estate, and the deed was recorded January 29, 1864. Ingle
was not a party to the suit. On the margin of the book in
which this deed was recorded is an entry, according to the
custom in the recorder's office, to the effect that the original
deed w s delivered to the beneficiary in May, 1864.
Counsel on both sides refer to certain correspondence between John S. and Sarah E. Hopkins in the summer of 1873,
in which both these deeds are mentioned. As to that to John
S., Mrs. Hopkins wrote: "What William did I do not know,
and if I signed it I signed it not knowing what it was, (which
fault was not yours,) for the deed of trust in which William
gives me the portion of his father's estate is duly recorded,
and was January 29, 1864.Y In her testimony in chief, Mrs.
Hopkins denied that she had joined her husband in a deed to
John S., and asserted that she had never gigned but one deed,
which was a deed to sell a small house, in 1858 or 1859. She
remembered that one of the magistrates who took the acknowledgment was named Donn. It appeared that the ackrfowledgment of the deed of 1860 to John S. was made before two
magistrates, one of whom was Mr. Donn, while he was not
one of the two justices of the peace before whom the deed of
1859 was acknowledged, and Mrs. Hopkins some days afterwards explained the reference to Mr. Donn as arising -from a
remark of counsel. However, upon cross-examination, she

HAMMoND v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.

testified that she was afraid she would not recommend any
one to trust her memory twenty years back; and that as to
the deed, she still did not recollect anything but the one deed,
and yet she might have signed another. She had -also completely forgotten her knowledge of the existence of the deed
of January 28, 1864, to Mr. Ingle, to which she had referred
in her letter of 1873, and which the record in the recorder's
office showed had been delivered to the beneficiary in May,
1864.

We understand it to be conceded that when the evidence
was taken in this suit both of the justices of the peace before
whom the deed of 1860 was acknowledged, as is admitted by
the bill, were dead; and, in the absence of evidence of fraud
or collusion on their part, their certificate ought to prevail.
Mrs. Hammond stated in her answer, upon information and
belief, that this deed of 1860, though absolute on its fdce, was
availed of by her father solely as a security and for the protection of his brother, the said William Mll. S., who was addicted
to intoxication, and that the full share of William M. S. in
the estate of his father was duly accounted for and paid to
him. In the settlement of March 28, 1865, William's share,
namely, $2667.60, was receipted for by John S., the latter
presumably claiming the power to do this by virtue of William's deed to him. On March 29, 1865, William was credited
with $2667.60 in an account opened before that time in, a
book kept by George W. and John S., and that account
showed that there was paid to him, on or before June 5, 1865,
in instalments, the aggregate sum of $2667.60, after deducting
$1641.01, made up of $1579.49 due John S. and $61.52 for
bill of furniture. On December 2, 1873, William receipted for
$503.29, his share of the purchase money from the Mix lots,
and in full of any or all demands to date. This amount is
shown on the same account, and is made up of nine items of
cash paid him, commencing with January 6, 1872, and closing
with December 2, 1873. This was not a bill to set aside the
'deed, nor is it framed in the aspect of repudiating the pay•ments to William as made in fraud of his wife. We do
not care to comment upon the testimony of William in this

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

connection. We think complainants failed to make out their
charges of fraud, and that apart from that, the defence of
leches interposes an insuperable bar to contention upon this

stlbje6t.
We perceive no adequate reason given for the delay in the
attack upon this deed, nor in respect of the proceeds of the
Mix lots, nor in the assault upon the account stated and settled, in the orphans' court in 1865. We fail to find any ground
assigned for the ignorance of plaintiffs of the proceedings
upon the executors' accounting, or why they received and
receipted for their distributive shares as determined thereby.
Indeed, all the matters relied on to justify the imputation of
fraud were known or could have been known to the plaintiffs
just as well at the time when they transpired as when the bill
was filed. No facts are shown of which plaintiffs were ignorant. No discovery was made which might not have been
made during the nineteen years. It is true that the children
of John Hopkins had confidence in their brother and uncle;
but as for nearly twenty years they apparently saw no reason
for believing that that confidence had been misplaced, it
would require much more convincing evidence than this
record affords to justify the conclusion that they had been in
fact the ivictims of imposition. Indeed, we do not understand
the testimony of the survivors as affirmatively questioning the
integrityi of the trustees Mr. Justice Merrick, in his well considered opinion in this
case, after saying that "the question then reduces itself to the
naked question whether the doctrine of a court of chancery,
with reg~rd to the necessity of the repose of society,, is not
sufficient'to prevent the opening of this inquiry under these
circumstafices," proceeds to examine the two classes of cases
to which- the doctrine is applied, that of constructive fraud in
the dealing by a trustee with the subject of the trust through
an intervening person for the acquisition of the legal title,
and that 'of actual fraud and concealment, and points out
the greater liberality in respect of lapse of time in the latter
class than in the former. Where there is no fraud in fact, he
says :

HAMMOND v. HOPKINS.
Opinion of the Court.

"If the party, in view of all the facts of the case, has slept
upon his rights, a court of chancery will not intervene; and in
measuring laches there are two extremely important considerations always taken notice of by a court of chancery, which
limit and narrow the measure of time which otherwise would
be liberal. Where there has been no change of circumstances
between the parties and no change with reference to the condition and value of the property, a court of chancery will run
very nearly if not quite up to the measure of the statute of
limitations as applied in analogous cases in a court of law.
But where there has been a change of circumstances with reference to the parties and the property, and still more where
death has intervened, so that the mouth of one party is closed,
and those who represent his interests are not in a predicament
to avail of the explanations which he might have made, out of
the charities of the law and in consideration of the fact that
fraud is never to be presumed, but must always be proved and
proved clearly, the courts limit very much, in such cases, the
measure of time within which they will grant relief, because
the presumption comes in aid of the dead man, that he has
gone to his account with a clear conscience. in this case one
of these trustees, the survivor, remained in, active life and
energy for nineteen years after the alleged technical fraud is
supposed to have been committed. There was no challenge,
during that time, of the transaction. Had there been the law
has a right to presume, and does presume, that he would have
had opportunities of explaining these transactions and vindicating himself, which opportunities are now lost. The counterpresumption now arises, that there has been delay with a view
to have the undue advantage of evidence on one side no longer
capable -of explanation on the other.
"This is this case stripped of all the surroundings with reference to it, stripped gf all the imputationis and suspicions piled
one upon another with artful ingenuity, arising out of a number of minute circumstances, no one of which has in itself,

"But it is very remarkable that, while the circumstances of

themselves do not carry any persuasive evidence of fraud to
the trained judicial mind, the parties themselves who are
impeaching the transaction, the surviving children who had
knowledge of what occurred, in their evidence in this cause
and under all the temptations to strain or overtop their testimony do not to-day impute any actual malversation to either
of the trustees. The utmost they say is that if they have
rights they want them. They never did call in question, in
the lifetime of the trustees, the integrity of the trustees: they
do not affirmatively call it in question to-day. They simply
say, at the uttermost, that, if they have rights, as has, been
suggested to them, in regard to the possibilities of a legal
administration of a trust in the manner in which I have
stated, they want those rights. Now, under all these circumstances, with all this lapse of time, with all the knowledge
they had then and there while the transactions were fresh,
with all the temptations now in their own minds to pervert
the facts, there is no one of those who are at all reliable in
testimony - and I do not include W. M. S. Hopkins in this
remai'k -who ventures to impute actual fraud to the trustees
whose estates they are now calling in question."
We concur in these views. In all cases where actual fraud
is not made out, but the imputation rests upon conjecture,
where the seal of death has closed the lips of those whose
character is involved, and lapse of time has impaired the recollection of transactions and obscured their details, the welfare of
society demands the rigid enforcement of the rule of diligence.
The hour-glass must supply the ravages of the scythe, and
those who have slept upon .their rights must be remitted to
the repose from which they should not have .been aroused.
The decree -is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill.
