GUSS v. NELSON.
APPEAL FROM, AND IN ERROR TO, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
TERRITORY OF OKLXHOMA.
No. 124.

Argued December 12, 1905.-Deoided January 15, 1906.

Oklahoma City v. MeMaster, 196 U. S.529, followed, to effect that the
review by this court of final judgments in civil cases of the Supreme
Court of Oklahoma is by writ of error under ยง 9 of the act of May 2,
1890, 26 Stat. 81, and not by appeal. The act of 1874 in regard to territorial courts does not apply.
An option to purchase if the buyer likes the property is essentially different from one to return the property and cancel the contract; in the former
case title does not pass until the option is determined, in the latter it
passes at once, subject to the right to rescind; and, as held in this case,
if the option to rescind is not exercised, and the property returned according to its terms, the sale is complete, and the promise to pay the
balance of the purchase price becomes absolute.

ON May 28, 1900, at Quthrie, Oklahoma Territory, the parties to this action entered into the following contract:
"Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this
28th day of May, 1900, to wit, as follows: J. T. Nelson agrees
on his part to turn over 25 per cent of the capital stock of the
following coal companies located in the Creek Nation, to wit:
Sapulpa, Choctaw, Catoosa, Wewoka, Red Fork, Neyaka,
Concharty, Tulsa, Car Creek and Broken Arrow M'ining Companies, to the following persons: U. C. Guss, W. H. Gray,
F. H. Greer and J. W. McNeal. The consideration of the delivery under which the above listed stock and other stock as
hereinafter described is as follows: This also includes the delivery of the records belonging to each of said above-named
companies, the seals and other records that in any way belong
to any of said companies. A payment of $500 is to be made
in cash upon delivery of the above-named property, and additional property in the way of stock hereinafter listed. The

$500 is to be considered an option on all said property until
the 4th day of March, 1901. At that date the above-named
parties are to pay to Nelson an additional sum of $4,500.00
(four thousand five hundred dollars), or in lieu thereof to turn
back to said Nelson all the property delivered by him. In
addition to the above-mentioned 25 per cent of the capital
stock aforesaid, which the said J. T. Nelson represents he owns
in his own right, he agrees to turn over and deliver enough more
stock to make the aggregate sum of stock delivered by him
under this contract as follows:"
(Here follows a list of companies and number of shares of
stock in each.)
"The $500.00 above mentioned is to be earnest money, to
be forfeited in case the balance of payment is not paid. Nelson also agrees to give U. C. Guss his proxy as director in each
of the above-named companies until such time as it may be
convenient for him to resign and Guss or some one else be
elected to fill the vacancy."
On April 6, 1901, Nelson brought suit in the District Court
of Logan County, Oklahoma Territory, to recover the additional sum named in the contract. After answer the case was
tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in
his favor on February 20, 1903, for $4,500 and interest. This
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory, 14 Oklahoma, 296, and its judgment was brought here both by appeal and writ of error.
Mr. A. G. C. Bierer, with whom Mr. Frank Dale was on the
brief, for appellants and plaintiffs in error:
The Supreme Court of the Territory, as well as the trial
court, fell into error and failed to take a correct view of the
contract, which was the basis of the action. The contract was
not for a sale and transfer of the stock. It was simply one
wherein the parties on the one hand contracted for a right to
purchase, and on the other, for the consideration named, agreed
to waive the right to sell the stock to other persons until after

If the contract were other than a mere option to purchase
on March 4, 1901, it has been complied with. Appellants have
been ready and willing ever since that day to turn back to
him everything received from Nelson. They determined by
that day not to purchase this stock and not to pay the $4,500,
but to return the stock. This is undenied, but the court held
that they were bound either to return the stock, seals, etc., to
Nelson at Fort Smith, or wherever he might happen to be that
day, or to pay the $4,500. This is not the law. The contract
did not stipulate where they were to turn the property back
to Nelson. 2 Coke Littleton, 55; Smith v. Smith, 25 Wend.

Time of turning back to Nelson of the stock, certificates and

is all that was required. Section 850, Stat. Oklahoma, 1893, 219.

AIR. JUSTiCJ. BReWeR, after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
The appeal must be dismissed. Oklahoma City v. McMaster,
196 U. S. 529.
Considering the writ of error, we remark that no rulings
were made in respect to the admission or rejection of testimony
presenting anything worthy of consideration. No special findings of fact were made by either the District or Supreme Court,
the former finding generally the issues in favor of the plaintiff
and rendering judgment upon such general finding, and the
latter merely discussing the right of recovery upon the pleadings and such general finding.
Plaintiffs in error contend that this is a mere option contract, and that no liability could attach to them except upon
an election to purchase the property, which they never made,
but, on the contrary, declinc l to make, and notified the plaintiff thereof by letter. They call attention to the clause providing that "the 8500 is to be considered an option," refer to
the fact that there is nothing in the contract in terms mentioning "sale" or "purchase." There is always danger in
applying a genaeric term to a contract and then subjecting
it to the general rules controlling contracts of that nature,
irrespective of its special stipulations. While an option is given
by the contract, and the price paid for the option is named, yet
it contains other clauses which are equally binding and from
which liability arises. Option contracts are not all alike. As
said in Hunt v. Wyman, 100 Massachusetts, 198, 200, quoted
approvingly by this court in Sturm v. Boker, 150 U. S. 312, 329:
"An option to purchase if he liked is essentially different
from an option to return a purchase if he should not like. In
one case the title will not pass until the option is determined;
in the other the property passes at once, subject to the right
to rescind and return."

GUSS v. NELSON.
200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In the contract before us, while an option running until
the fourth of March, 1901, is given, for which $500 is to be
paid, the stipulation for such option is followed by this: "At
that date the above-named parties are to pay to Nelson an
additional sum of $4,500 (four thousand five hundred dollars),
or in lieu thereof to turn back to said Nelson all the property
delivered by him." Here is an absolute promise on the part of
plaintiffs in error to pay an additional sum of 84,500 at a specified date, or in lieu thereof to turn back the property. They
did not return the property. The amount to be paid and the
time of the payment are expressly named, and that stipulation
in the contract is as significant and binding as any other. It
shows that the option given is an option to return, and that
if it is not exercised at the time named the sale is complete,
and the promise to pay the balance of the purchase price becomes absolute. This construction of the contract is reinforced by the fact that not only was the stock to be delivered
to the plaintiffs in error, but also Nelson agreed to give, and
did give, his proxy as director in each of the companies, so that
the possession of the stock and all the rights which attached
to it passed to the plaintiffs in error, to be exercised by them
subject to the right at any time before the fourth of March to
return the property. Haskins v. Dern, Supreme Court of
Utah, 19 Utah, 89, is directly in point.
We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and its judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JusTIcU McKEUNNA took no part in the decision of this

case.
