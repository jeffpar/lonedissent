WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Statement of the Case.

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.
13, 1901.
No. 222. Argued April 9, 1901.-Decided MAay
Payment of taxes on account of property otherwise liable to taxation can
only be avoided by clear proof of a valid contract of exemption from such
payment.
The validity of such a contract presupposes a good consideration therefor.
In this case the ordinances exempting from taxation were only exemptions
for the year in which the ordinance was passed; and the same rule applies to all the exempting ordinances.
The views of the Supreme Court of Georgia in this case are sustained by
this court.

THE plaintiffs in error commenced this proceeding in the superior court of the State of Georgia, Chatham County, against
the mayor, etc., of the city of Savannah and its city marshal,
to enjoin the collection of taxes upon certain real estate in that
city, of which they claim to be lessees from the city, and
they allege that the taxes assessed upon such real estate are illegal; they also seek to recover from the city the amount of
taxes theretofore paid by them on such real estate, under protest. The trial of the case resulted in a judgment for the city,
which was, on appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, affirmed, and the plaintiffs have brought the case here on writ
of error.
They claim that the levying and collection of the taxes referred to, under an ordinance of the city providing therefor,
passed in 1878, constitute an impairment of the obligations of
a contract between the city and the predecessors in title of the
plaintiffs in error, made at the time the real estate was purchased, by which contract it was agreed that on the payment
of a certain annual sum, called "ground rent," to the city by
the holders of the real estate, it was to be forever exempt from
all city taxation.
Upon the trial of the action these facts appeared: Prior to

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

1790 the city of Savannah owned certain lots which were called
"common lots," and on September 28 of that year the common
council passed an ordinance for disposing of a portion of them.
Each lot, by the provisions of the ordinance, was to be valued
by the city, and then put up for sale at public outcry, and the
highest bidder, over and including the original valuation, was
to have the lot, and if he chose to pay the whole amount of his
bid in cash he was to have a deed conveying it to him in fee
simple, or he might, instead of making the whole cash payment, agree with the city to pay in cash the balance of his bid
over the valuation, called the increase money, and also to pay
a ground rent of five per centum upon the amount of the valuation, payable quarterly, and in that event the lot might be retained in his hands or in the hands of his heirs and assigns forever on payment of such ground rent. The ordinance further
provided that at any time thereafter the purchaser or his heirs
or assigns should have the power to pay the original valuation
money, with what rent might be due up to that time, in full
discharge and extinguishment of the ground rent, and he or
they should thereupon be entitled to the land in fee simple.
The city was also to give a deed by way of bargain and sale to
each purchaser of lots which should vest an absolute or conditional estate in the purchaser, according to the circumstances;
that is to say, an absolute one if the valuation and increase
money should be paid down, or a conditional one if the valuation
money should not be paid down, but which should become absolute if and when the valuation money should at any future
time be paid into the treasury, which payment should be acknowledged by the mayor and a majority of the aldermen,
under the seal of the city and attested by the city treasurer, to
be endorsed on the deed. The ordinance continued:
"And the said conditional estates shall amount to this, that
the use and occupation of the premises are forever secured to
the purchaser and others claiming under him or her on payment
of the ground rent, but on failure therein for the space of
fifteen days after the same shall become due the said premises
are to revert to the corporation, who shall immediately thereafter possess the power of reentry, and having by means of

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Statement of the Case.

their proper officers exercised such power and given a notice
thereof in writing posted on the premises, the lot or lots so
entered upon, with all improvements thereon, are to be considered at the expiration of ten days thereafter as absolutely
revested in the corporation, and the conditional estate therein
determined, to all intents and purposes, as fully as if the same
had not been bargained for or purchased, any sale or incumbrance or other act, made or suffered by the purchaser or purchasers or others under him, her or them, to the contrary thereof
in anywise notwithstanding."
Pursuant to such ordinance the lands were sold and the purchasers of many of the lots elected to hold their purchases on
ground rent payable quarterly, as stated in the ordinance.
Deeds were thereupon executed on the part of the city and
also were signed by the respective purchasers. Lands have
been sold from time to time under ordinances of substantially
the same character and containing language in substance the
same up to 1872, since which time conditional sales have been
abandoned.
The deeds contained a provision that "In consideration of
the rent to be paid, and of the several covenants and agreements to be performed, (mayor and aldermen,) have bargained
and sold, and by these presents do bargain and sell, unto the
all that lot of land (describing it)
said
executors, administrators and asunto the said
signs, forever, on this express condition. Nevertheless, that
executors, and administhe said
trators and assigns," shall pay rent as covenanted; and "in
case of failure herein for the space of twenty days after any of
the said quarterly payments shall become due, that then the
said lot and premises shall revert to the corporation of the said
city, who shall immediately thereafter possess the power of reentry; and having, by means of their proper officers, exercised
such power, and given a notice thereof in writing, posted on
the premises, the said lot, with all improvements thereon, shall
be considered, at the expiration of ten days thereafter, as absolutely revested in the corporation, and the estate by these
presents created determined to all intents and purposes as fully

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

as if the same had not been bargained for or purchased; any
sale or incumbrance, or other act made or suffered by the said
executors, administrators or assigns, or others
under him or them, to the contrary thereof in anywise notwithstanding."
The purchaser also covenanted to pay the annual rent, and
that in case of failure the city should have the lawful right of
reentry as already provided for.
The deed also contained the following provision:
"And it is hereby declared to be the true intent and meaning of these presents, and all parties to the same, that, on payment of the said ground rent, at the times and after the manner
hereinbefore directed, the said
heirs, executors,
administrators and assigns, shall and may from time to time,
and at all times hereafter, peaceably and quietly have, hold,
use, occupy, possess and enjoy the said lot and premises, and
receive and take the rents, issues and profits thereof, and of
every part thereof, to
- and - own use, absolutely,
without the let, suit, trouble, eviction or denial of the said corporation or of any person whatsoever acting under them or by
virtue of their authority, subject only to such assessments and
burthens as shall be in common with other lotholders in the
said city."
It was also provided in the deed that the purchaser, his heirs,
executors or administrators or assigns, might at any time pay
into the city treasury the valuation money and the rent then
due, in full discharge and extinguishment of such rent, and in
that case there should be an acknowledgment of such payment
under the seal of the city, signed by the mayor and a majority
of the aldermen and attested by the city clerk, and indorsed
on the deed, "which shall then and from thenceforth vest an
absolute estate, in fee simple, of and in the said lot and premises, in the said
heirs and assigns to and
their only proper use and behoof forever." It is admitted that
the same character of deed has been executed for lots sold
under other sales since 1790.

council of the city, in regard to meetings of that body in 1790

and thereafter, were put in evidence, from which it appeared
that the ordinance for the sale of these lots was induced by
the fact that the expenses of the city government were more
than its revenues, and these sales were provided for in the hope
that the condition of the city's finances might thereby be improved. There was also put in evidence a notice of sale of lots,
advertised in The Georgia Gazette of June 13, 1799, in which
were specified the terms contained in the ordinance for the
sale of the lots, and the advertisement contained the statement
that the "purchasers are at liberty to take a lease to him or
her or his heirs and assigns forever of the lots so purchased, at
a ground rent of five per cent on the valuation," etc.
An ordinance for laying off into city lots what was called
the "Springfield Plantation," and providing for the sale of the
same, passed in the year 1851, was also put in evidence, which
contained substantially the same plan as that provided for in
the ordinance of September 28, 1790, except that the conditional sale was to be for twenty-four years only. Although
the lots mentioned in the petition of the plaintiffs in error in
this case are not situated within the Springfield Plantation, the
ordinance and the deed thereunder regarding those lots were
put in evidence for the purpose of comparison with the ordinance of 1790, and the deeds executed thereunder, in order to
show that the same language, except as to the term, was used
in the instrument which granted a lease for but twenty-four
years as was used in the other granting a perpetual term.
There were also ordinances of February 27 and July 31, 1851,
put in evidence, the former of which permitted one of two or
more tenants in common or joint tenants to pay his proportion
of the purchase money, and, upon such payment, he should receive a deed in fee, and any lessee of a city lot might, on application, have it divided into two or more parts and receive a
lease for the same; and the other ordinance provided for increasing the depth of certain lots, at an increased rent therefor,
payable at the same time that the regular ground rents on these
lots fell due.
A report of the mayor in 1854, to the common council, was
put in evidence, in which was a statement of the resources of

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

the city of Savannah, among which were designated 643 lots
in 22 wards "under lease;" also two reports of the mayor, the
one on October 31, 1855, and the other a year later, both containing similar statements as to the number of lots belonging
to the city, which were "under lease," and similar reports from
and including 1857, up to and including 1877, with the exception of the years 1864 and 1865, when no report was made by
the mayors of the city. This class of evidence was offered for
the purpose of showing that the title conveyed to the purchasers was under a lease, and that it was not a conditional estate
subject to be terminated by a breach of a condition subsequent,
and that the city recognized the conveyance as a lease and not
in truth as a conditional estate.
On April 7, 1806, an ordinance was passed by the city council for raising a fund for the support of a "watch" in the city,
which provided that a tax should be levied on property therein,
"including all lots held by lease from the corporation," but on
November 24, 1806, an ordinance was passed providing "that
so much of the first section of the aforesaid ordinance as imposes a tax on lots held by lease from the corporation
be and the same is hereby repealed."
It was admitted that every annual tax ordinance to raise
revenue for the city passed by the mayor and aldermen from
the above date, November 24, 1806, up to and including the
ordinance of January 22, 1857, used the words "excepting lots
held by lease from the corporation." On December 11, 1857,
the tax ordinance provided as follows:
"SEc. 4. The following real property shall be exempt from
taxation, to wit: each lot of land held at the time of the passage of this ordinance upon the payment of ground rent to the
mayor and aldermen, of the class commonly called city lots."
The annual report of the mayor for the year 1871 was also
put in evidence, in which the following language occurs: "It
is not known to the foreign public that a very large part of the
real estate in the city consists of lots sold on condition of the
payment of ground rent, and are, therefore, not the subject of
taxation, and are not included in the assessments."
It was also admitted that lots known as "ground rent lots"

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Statement of the Case.

were never in fact assessed for taxation from 1790 until some
time after the passage of the ordinance of May 29, 1878, and
that those lots were omitted from the assessment books made
in 1807 and every year thereafter down to the assessment book
made out in the year 1878, and that in fact no city taxes were
ever levied on them until after the resolution of the common
council of November 17, 1889, under which they have been for
the first time assessed for city taxation for the year 1890.
It was also admitted that no taxes were in fact assessed or
levied under the ordinance of April 7, 1806, above mentioned.
The holders of these city lots have always paid state and county
taxes and street improvements and assessments for sidewalks
and all other assessments and burdens common to lot owners in
the said city, except city taxes. A report of the finance committee made in 1872, and signed by the chairman, was also put
in evidence, in which it was stated as follows:
"The reason why city lots are not taxed beyond the ground
rent is that the city is understood to have bound itself not to
tax them.
"The ordinance of 1790, which was the first to provide for
the sale of lots on these terms, contains a stipulation that the
purchaser of such a lot, and all claiming under him, shall have
the use, etc., upon paying the ground rent. This ordinance has
been followed either in terms or substance by all succeeding
ordinances providing for such sale.
"It is of no moment that the stipulation does not appear in
the deeds; the ordinances contain the real terms of the contracts and control the deeds whenever the latter depart from
them or conflict with them. And as the city has never taxed
such lots, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that such was the
design when the ordinance of 1790 was framed."
The ordinance of May 29, 1878, provided that"Every person and corporation owning real property in said
city, including improvements, shall pay a tax upon said property of two and one half per centum of the value thereof, including ground-rent lots, except on such property as may be
exempt from taxation under the laws of this State."

Counsel for Parties.

The city is given full power of taxation by state legislation.
Code of 1863, see. 4756; Code of 1882, sec. 4847.
Oral evidence was also given from which it appeared that on
sales of the property under various ordinances of the same nature as that of 1790 the city marshal by whom the sales were
made "would announce that so long as the lots were held under
ground-rent plan they would be free from city taxes. These
announcements were made under authority of the committee.
And often when the bidding would lag the marshal would remind
the bystanders that there was only a twenty per cent cash payment required, and that there was no city taxes, but only an
annual ground rent."
One of the witnesses, who was himself at the time of some of
the sales an alderman between 1858 and 1869, stated:
"I, as a city official, in good faith, have made the statement
and directed the marshal so to announce when making sales of
city lots under my supervision as chairman of the committee on
public sales and city lots, and under the common and universal
construction of the city deeds, the absence of any reservation
of a right to tax the lots sold under ground rent has always
been construed as an agreement not to tax."
Another witness said that he would not say that the city of
Savannah ever at any time formally agreed not to tax groundrent lots; he did not know of any official action taken thereon
by the city.
The above are substantially the facts upon which the contention of the plaintiffs in error that their lots are exempt from city
taxation is founded. There is no evidence that any of them
bought their lots at a sale where an announcement of exemption was made, or that they purchased them under the belief
that they were forever legally exempt from all city taxation.
They also claimed that the deed itself, irrespective of the
above testimony, necessarily and by its terms implies a perpetual exemption from all city taxation upon the lots so long as
the ground rent is paid.

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Opinion of the Court.

Mr. SamueZ B. Adans for defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the above statement of
facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
The contention on the part of the plaintiffs in error is that,
in the exercise of the taxing power granted it by the legislature,
the common council of the city adopted the ordinance of May,
1878, and in providing therein for the taxation of the leased
lots it thereby impaired the obligation of the contract existing
between the city and the holders of that class of property,
among whom are the plaintiffs in error, and the ordinance is
therefore to that extent void. This contract they say is evidenced, first, by the ordinance of 1790 and the deeds executed
in pursuance of its provisions; also by the minutes of the common council of the city and by subsequent proceedings of the
common council; by the statements of the city officials at the
time when some of the sales of the property were made; by
the reports of the officials, mayors of the city and committees
of the common council; by the actual omission for a hundred
years-from 1790 to 1890-to tax these lots; also by ordinances
similar to that of 1790 for the sale of lots, passed subsequently
to that year, and by the deeds executed pursuant to such ordinances, which, it is admitted, were in substance similar to those
executed under the ordinance of 1790.
Taking all the foregoing evidence into consideration, including the ordinance of 1790 and the deeds executed under it, we
are unable to see that any contract of exemption has been
proved. The payment of taxes on account of property otherwise liable to taxation can only be avoided by clear proof of a
valid contract of exemption from such payment and the validity of such contract presupposes a good consideration therefor.
If the property be in its nature taxable the contract exempting
it from taxation must, as we have said, be clearly proved. It
will not be inferred from facts which do not lead irresistibly
and necessarily to the existence of the contract. The facts
proved must show either a contract expressed in terms, or else
it must be implied from facts which leave no room for doubt

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

that such was the intention of the parties and that a valid consideration existed for the contract. If there be any doubt on
these matters, the contract has not been proven and the exemption does not exist. This has been many times decided by this
court.

Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527, 573; Bank of Com-

merce v. Tennessee, 161 U. S. 134, 146, and cases cited.
The different annual ordinances for taxation passed by the
common council, exempting from taxation thereunder the leased
lots, were but exemptions for the year in which the ordinance
was passed, and there can be no plausible claim urged that
they, one or all, constituted any contract for exemption beyond
the time of each specific ordinance. The statements of officials
when lots were sold, that they were not taxable, did not constitute a contract. The lots had not in fact been taxed at the
time of these statements and had been annually exempted from
taxation, and the statements amounted to no more than opinions of officials as to what would be done in the future. There
is no evidence that they had the least power to speak for or to
bind the corporation in this behalf. The reports of committees
that the lots were not taxable are of the same character-merely
the opinions of officials upon a question of law, and not in the
nature of a contract.
Upon this question of proof of a contract we quote what was
said by the Supreme Court of Georgia in this case upon the
last review, through Mr. Justice Lewis (107 Ga. 1):
"Was such a contract shown in the present case? With
the view of determining whether or not there was, we have
naturally looked to the official action taken by the governing
body of the city, either in its ordinances or resolutions providing for the plan upon which the sales were to be made and
the consequences and effect thereof, or in its deed of conveyance to the purchaser. Upon examining the various ordinances
set out in the record we fail to find any reference whatever to
the matter of exempting this property from taxation, and instead of finding any stipulation to that effect in the form of
deed invariably made by the city to the various purchasers
there appears a clause directly negativing the idea that the city
ever intended to grant a perpetual exemption of this property

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Opinion of the Court.

from the burden of taxation. In each instance it was recited
in the deed given to the purchaser that the conveyance of the
city was made and the rights of the purchaser thereunder were
conferred 'subject only to such assessments and burthens as
shall be in common with other lotholders in the said city.'
The term ' assessment' is often used as a synonym of I taxes.'
Indeed, one of the definitions of this term given by Webster is
'a tax.' But even if this word, as used in the deed, does not
necessarily refer to taxation, the word 'burthen,' which is also
therein employed, is certainly sufficiently comprehensive to include municipal taxes. Taken all together, the language
adopted is clearly broad enough to embrace every burden then
existing or which might thereafter be lawfully imposed upon
other landowners in the city. The deed was signed by both
parties. Here, then, is a specific written agreement made between the parties to the contract relating to the sale of property by the city, whereby it is expressly declared that the property shall be held by the purchaser (and, of course, by his assigns) subject to any burden which might be borne in common
by the holders of other lots in the city, necessarily including
that of municipal taxation.
"Plaintiffs in error contend, however, that the contract they
insist upon is evidenced sufficiently by the conduct of the municipal officers at the time the sales by the city took place.
It was shown that when lots were put up for sale the city marshal publicly announced that they would not be subject to city
taxes; that this was generally understood by the city at large,
and that for nearly a hundred years after these sales first began the municipal authorities failed to tax the lands, and in
various ordinances afterwards passed these ground-rent lands
were exempted. The effect of these ordinances was merely to
grant an exemption from taxes for the particular years to which
they related. Mere nonuser by a government of its power to
levy a tax, it matters not for how long it continued, can never
be construed into a forfeiture of the power. This question
was directly passed upon by this court when the case was here
before. As to this point, Chief Justice Bleckley said: ' Whatever the expectation of purchasers or the wabroken practice of

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

the city hitherto may have been, the mandate of the constitution of 1877 is to tax all property, save that expressly exempted by the legislature under constitutional authority, if
any is taxed. That this mandate may have heretofore been
disregarded is no reason why it should not be obeyed now.'
"There is an absolute want of any testimony in the record
showing that the mayor and aldermen of the city of Savannah,
by ordinance, resolution or official action of any sort, ever authorized the marshal to make the public announcement above
referred to in offering for sale the city's property.
Besides all this, we fail to find in the record any testimony
showing that these particular plaintiffs or any of their predecessors in title bought any of the lots in question under the impression that the same would be exempt from taxes. Indeed,
it is not shown that any of these lots were purchased at a sale
at which the marshal made such an announcement as that above
referred to. The evidence simply goes to the extent of showing
what was his custom in this particular and what was the general impression of the public in regard to the matter. For
aught that appears, those who actually bought at these sales
were fully advised as to the truth with reference thereto, if not
prior to the sale, at least before they complied with their bids
and accepted the city's conveyance of the lots purchased by
them."
We think the opinion correctly states the facts and the law
relating to them.
Looking specially at the contents of the deeds executed under the ordinance of 1790, which were signed by both parties,
the city and the purchasers, we find that the provision under
which the purchasers took the title and by which they were
thereafter peaceably and quietly to have possession of the lots
was by positive agreement, "subject to all such assessments
and burthens as might be in common with other lotholders in
the city."
Plaintiffs in error endeavor to give to the word "assessments,"
contained in the deeds from the city, its more modern meaning
of a peculiar kind of tax levied upon lands specially benefited
by improvements which are to be paid for by such assessments.

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Opinion of the Court.

The fact is notorious that a century ago special assessments of
that kind upon the lands benefited were not usual in this country, and at that time the word was used as synonymous with
"crates or taxes," generally. Thus, in a statute passed by the
legislature of Georgia in the year 1787, to be found in Watkins'
Digest of the Laws of Georgia, 1755-1790, at page 354, it was
provided in the fourth section, in speaking of the city of Savannah and the hamlets thereof, "that it shall and may be lawful
for the said wardens, or a majority of them, yearly and every
year, or oftener, if occasion may require, to make, lay and assess one or more rate or rates, assessment or assessments, upon
all or every person or persons who do or shall inhabit, hold, use
or occupy, possess or enjoy any lot, ground, house or place,

within the limits of the town of Savannah or hamlets

as aforesaid, for raising such sum or sums of money as the said
wardens, or a majority of them, shall in their discretion judge
necessary for and towards carrying this act into execution ; and
in case of refusal or neglect to pay such rate and assessment,
the same shall be levied and recovered in manner as hereinafter
directed."
Here is an instance of the use of the word "assessment" at
that time in relation to this very city as descriptive of a general
tax upon the owners of property within the limits of the city,
and to be expended for the general purposes of the corporation.
We agree with Mr. Justice Lewis in his construction of this language contained in the deed.
It is further objected in behalf of the plaintiffs in error that
the condition that the land was to be subject to assessments,
etc., was inserted in the deeds without the authority of the common council, and that the ordinance of 1790 providing for the
sale of lots contained no such provision. We think the deeds
are substantially in accord with that ordinance, and there is
nothing therein inconsistent or at war with the insertion of such
provision in the deed; it was but providing for one of the details connected with the sale, and there was an implied power
under the ordinance to do so. In addition to that the purchasers
took their deeds with such language contained in them, and
having themselves signed the deeds they personally agreed to

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

the condition, and took their titles subject thereto. We do not
by this mean to intimate that the title would not have been
equally subject to the condition contained in the deed by accepting the deed while not signing it ; but in addition to the acceptance there is the affirmative act of signing the instrument, and
we think the language subjecting the lots to the same assessments and burthens as were laid in common with other lotholders created a valid agreement, and made the lands subject
to the same kind of taxation as is levied upon other lots in the
city.
The covenant on the part of the city that the purchasers
should have peaceable and quiet possession, use, occupation and
enjoyment of the lots upon payment of the rent as it became
due is in nowise violated by the taxation of the lots in the hands
of the purchasers or their assigns. A covenant for quiet enjoyment would not under these circumstances include an exemption
from taxation. The purchasers of these lots became to all intents and purposes their owners, as they had the right to their
possession, use and occupation forever upon payment of the rent,
and they could assign or devise the same, and their assignees or
devisees would take good title, and their heirs would also take
in case there was no assignment or devise. They could also, at
their discretion and on the payment of the money agreed upon,
become owners in fee.
Although the city retained the right of reentry for nonpayment of rent, the character of the title conveyed to the purchasers and their heirs and assigns was not thereby so changed
from an absolute fee that the property actually conveyed could
not be assessed for the payment of city taxes. The interest of
the purchasers was capable of assessment for taxation, and their
right was in substance that of ownership. It bears no resemblance to the case of an ordinary lease for years between landlord and tenant.
In reference to this subject, Mr. Chief Tustice Bleckley, in
his opinion in this case on its first appearance in the Supreme
Court of Georgia, (87 Georgia, 397,) at page 399 et seq., said:
"The value of property consists in its use, and he who owns
the use forever, though it be on condition subsequent, is the true

WELLS v. SAVANNAH.
Opinion of the Court.

owner of the property for the time being. This holds equally
of a city lot or of all land in the world. Where taxation is
ad valorem, values are the ultimate objects of taxation, and
they to whom the values belong should pay the taxes. Land
sold or by a contract of bargain and sale demised forever subject to a perpetual rent, is taxable as corporeal property; and
in private hands the rent also is taxable as an incorporeal hereditament. The tax on the former is chargeable to the purchaser
or perpetual tenant, and on the latter to the owner of the rent.
The corporeal property in such case is at the direct risk of the
purchaser; he alone sustains the losses of depreciation in value,
and he alone takes the benefit of appreciation. The vendor
risks only the fixed rent or the fixed purchase money, and
neither of these will ever become more or less by anything
which may happen to the premises. Only his security, not
his property, will be affected thereby. It is to be assumed that
the whole contract between the parties will be observed, not
broken, and their true relation to the property is to be determined on that assumption. Possession of real estate attended
with an indefeasible right to occupy in perpetuity, and also with
an indefeasible right to be clothed with the fee upon the voluntary payment of a fixed sum as purchase money, will constitute
the purchaser the substantial owner-of the property. So long
as his possession, supplemented with these rights, continues, he
is not a mere lessee but a purchaser admitted into possession on
the faith of his contract of purchase. Such were the contracts
involved in the present case, and under them the purchasers
have the actual possession and use of the premises, with the
right to hold forever, on condition of paying up the purchase
money whenever they please, and until that time an annual
ground rent due by quarterly instalments, the amount of which
is fixed by contract, and is the equivalent of interest at a moderate rate _er annum on the unpaid purchase money. In all
essential respects, so far as liability for taxes is concerned, these
purchasers are in the position of ordinary purchasers in possession under a bond for title, and these last are chargeable with
accruing taxes on lands so held. Bank v. Danfort , 80 Ga.

question abides in the municipality. The city but retained a
qualified and wholly unproductive title as security for the purchase money and, until that shall be paid, as security also for
the annually accruing compensation under the name of ground
rents in lieu of interest on that money. If the municipal government held all the values in the city as trustee for the owners, or as security for purchase money, these values would be
none the less taxable for that reason. The constitution of the
State requires that taxes on property shall be ad valorem, and
that when any part is taxed all shall be taxed which is subject
for the time being to the taxing power in the given locality.
This rule is without exception. It prevails in Savannah. .fayor
& Aldermen of Savannah v. Weed, 84 Ga. 683.

The prop-

erty in question is situate in that city, and, as already said, its
beneficial ownership is not in the municipality, but in those who
long ago purchased it from the city or who hold under such purchasers by succession to their title. :Relatively to the question
of taxation, it makes no substantial difference whether the estate or property or beneficial owners be classed as realty or
personalty, whatever property of either kind belongs to them
is taxable ad valorem. That the so-called ground-rent lots, as
long as the conditions of sale are unbroken, are the property
of the purchasers follows from what was decided by this court
in Laurence v. The fKayor, '71 Ga. 392, and that case shows
that, even after condition broken, the limit of the city's rights
would generally be to have all arrearages cleared and discharged,
the surplus proceeds realized by a sale of the property being payable to the real owner. Our reasons for the conclusion at which
we have arrived need not be further elaborated. The constitution is imperative that property is to be taxed ad valorem. The
foundation principle of such a system is that those who own and
enjoy values are to pay the taxes. The real owners of the money
which these lots would now sell for on the market are the persons whom we have designated as owners, and it is upon the
cash market value that taxes are assessable. If that value is
any less, on account of the subjection of the property to ground

Opinion of the Court.

rents or unpaid purchase money, than it otherwise would be, the
fact would no doubt be taken into consideration in making the
assessment. The market value, whatever that may be, is the
proper basis.
"2. There was no error, either of practice or decision, in
denying the injunction. Whatever the expectation of the purchasers, or the unbroken practice of the city hitherto may have
been, the mandate of the constitution of 1877 is to tax all property, save that expressly exempted by the legislature under
constitutional authority, if any is taxed. That this mandate
may have heretofore been disregarded, is no reason why it
should not be obeyed now."
We think these views are a correct exposition of the law applicable herein.
We find no element of estoppel in the case. As has been
said, the statements of officials made at the time some of the
sales may have been effected were nothing more than expressions of opinion, there being no evidence of any agreement on
the part of the city or its duly authorized agents to exempt perpetually or at all these lots from taxation for city purposes.
The ordinances and the deeds show the transaction and there
is no estoppel arising from the language there used. On the
contrary, there is evidence of an agreement to pay such taxes.
Such an estate as was created by these deeds does not in our
opinion come under the general rule which imposes on a landlord, when the lease is silent upon the subject, the payment of
taxes chargeable upon the premises during the term of the lease.
Where the purchaser holds real property for a term which may
be in perpetuity, upon the condition of paying a certain ground
rent, and where he is entitled to a deed conveying the fee at
any time on the payment of certain money, he is more nearly
described as an owner than he is as a lessee of such property,
and he would be liable to pay the taxes imposed upon the property upon the principle which is set forth in Sanderson v. City
of Scranton, 105 Penn. St. 469, and Delaware c(. Railroad
Company v. Sanderson, 109 Penn. St. 583. It is not necessary to decide this question, however, as the specific language

of the deed places the burden of paying the taxes on the purchaser and his grantees.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia was right,
and must, therefore, be

RED RIWER VALLEY BANK v. CRAIG.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA.
No. 231. Argued and submitted April 11, 1901.-Decided %lay13, 1901.
There is no such difference in the several statutes of North Dakota, so far
as regards the rights of the parties, as to forbid the application of the
latest statute to a case where a mortgage was forgiven, and the materials
furnished prior to its passage; and the legislation under review cannot
be held to violate any rights of the plaintiff in error, protected by the
Constitution of the United States.
A mortgage which is subsequent to the right of subsequent lienors who
furnish materials or labor in the erection of a building to sell the same,
and have it removed for the payment of the liens, is not reduced in value
by a statute authorizing the sale of the property such as is set forth in
the opinion of the court.

Tis action was brought to enforce certain mechanic's liens
provided for by section 4:796, Revised Code of North Dakota,
upon real estate described in the complaint. The trial resulted
in a judgment in favor of the lienors, which on appeal was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, and the Red River
Valley National Bank of Fargo, one of the defendants below,
has brought the case here by writ of error.
The trial court found the following facts: On July 8, 1S841,
Elvira Cooper was the owner of the property, being lot 6,
block 5, of the original townsite of Fargo, Cass Count', North
Dakota, and on that day she, with her husband, mortgaged it
to secure the payment of the sum. of $3000 to the Travelers'
Insurance Company of Hlartford, Connecticut. Prior to January 1, 1893, the mortgagor sold and conveyed the property,
