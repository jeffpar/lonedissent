MR. JUSTICE GRAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

This was an appeal from an order of the Supreme Court of
the District of Columbia sitting in bankruptcy, granting a discharge to Robert W. Shufeldt.
Shufeldt had been adjudged a bankrupt April 5, 1899, on his
petition alleging that he was indebted to the amount of $4538.33,
and had no assets which were not exempt under the Bankrupt
Act of 1898. The debts from which he sought release were as
follows:
Secured debt to Washington National Banking and
Loan Association,

$3200 00

Unsecured debts as follows:
Florence Audubon,
William H. Smith,
Lewis J. Yeager,
Sundry small debts,.

$800
150

238

00

1338 33
$4538 33

Shufeldt was, and had been for several years before filing his
petition in bankruptcy, a surgeon with the rank of captain in
the United States Army, on the retired list, and was in receipt
of a salary of 8175 a month, his pay as such retired officer.

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

The debt of $3200 was the debt of himself and his wife, secured on land in Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland, conveyed by him to his wife in March, 1898, without
consideration.
The debt of $800 represented arrears of alimony, granted to
his former wife, Florence Audubon, on February 25, 1898, by a
decree of the circuit court of Montgomery County in the State
of Maryland, in a cause of divorce, directing him to pay alimony to her at the rate of $50 a month, beginning April 1,
1898. No part of that alimony has been paid.
About March 1, 1898, Shufeldt left Montgomery County, and
took up his residence in the city of Washington in the District
of Columbia. A suit in equity has been instituted and is still
pending in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to
enforce the aforesaid decree for alimony, and to make him pay
the alimony in arrear.
The debt of $150 to William HI. Smith was a promissory note
given for taking testimony in the divorce suit under a commission from the Maryland court, and was duly assigned to John
W. Hulse before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
The debt of $150 to Lewis 1. Yeager was for professional services rendered in the District of Columbia in the equity suit
aforesaid.
The small debts for $238.33 were contracted for supplies
furnished to Shufeldt and his family before the filing of the
petition in bankruptcy.
After the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, Florence Audubon filed in court her claim for $800, being the arrears of alimony, describing it as "a debt" due by him to her; and voted
thereon at the meeting of creditors for the election of a trustee.
She afterwards filed a memorandum directing the withdrawal
of her claim ; but no order of the court to that effect was passed.
It was objected that the claim for alimony was not a provable debt under the Bankrupt Act, and should be excepted from
the list of debts for which a discharge in bankruptcy might be
granted. The court overruled the objection, and granted the
discharge, being of opinion that the arrears of alimony which
had accrued against the bankrupt up to the time of the adjudi-

Opinion of the Court.

cation in bankruptcy constituted a provable debt, in the sense
of the Bankrupt Act of 1898; but that the discharge could not
affect any instalments accruing since that adjudication. Florence Audubon appealed to this court.
By section 4 of the Bankrupt Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,
"any person who owes debts, except a corporation, shall be
entitled to the benefits of this act as a voluntary bankrupt."
30 Stat. 547. An officer in the army falls within this description; and it may be that he is not bound to include his pay in
his schedule. Flarty v. Odlum, (1790) 3 T. R. 681 ; Apthorpe
v. Aythorpe, (1887) 12 Prob. Div. 192. Our bankrupt act contains no such provision as the English Bankruptcy Act, 1883,
authorizing the court, when the bankrupt is an officer in the
army or navy, or employed in the civil service, to order a portion of his pay to be applied for the benefit of his creditors in
bankruptcy. In re Ward, (1897) 1 Q. B. 266. But the question now before us is not whether his pay can be reached in
bankruptcy, but whether he is entitled to a discharge from the
arrears of alimony due to his former wife.
The Bankrupt Act of 1898, provides in ยง 1, that a "discharge" means "the release of a bankrupt from all his debts
which are provable in bankruptcy, except such as are excepted
by this act;" and includes, in ยง 63, among the debts which may
be proved against his estate, "a fixed liability, as evidenced by
a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing," at
the time of the petition in bankruptcy, whether then payable
or not, and debts "founded upon a contract, expressed or implied." 30 Stat. 541, 563.
Alimony does not arise from any business transaction, but
from the relation of marriage. It is not founded on contract,
express or implied, but on the natural and legal duty of the
husband to support the wife. The general obligation to support is made specific by the decree of the court of appropriate
jurisdiction. Generally speaking, alimony may be altered by
that court at any time, as the circumstances of the parties may
require. The decree of a court of one State, indeed, for the
present payment of a definite sum of money as alimony, is a
record which is entitled to full faith and credit in another State,

and may therefore be there enforced by suit. Barber v. Barber,
(1858) 21 How. 582; Lynde v. Lynde, (1901) 181 U. S. 183.
But its obligation in that respect does not affect its nature. In
other respects, alimony cannot ordinarily be enforced by action
at law, but only by application to the court which granted it,
and subject to the discretion of that court. Permanent alimony
is regarded rather as a portion of the husband's estate to which
the wife is equitably entitled, than as strictly a debt; alimony
from time to time may be regarded as a portion of his current
income or earnings; and the considerations which affect either
can be better weighed by the court having jurisdiction over the
relation of husband and wife, than by a court of a different
jurisdiction.
In the State of Maryland, and in the District of Columbia,
alimony is granted by decree of a court of equity. llrallinaford
v. lFallingford,(1825) 6 Har. & Johns. 485; Crane v. 111aginnis,

(1829) 1 Gill & Johns. 463; Jamison v. Jamison, (1847) 4 Maryland Ch. 289; Tolnan v. Tolman, (1893) 1 App. D. 0. 299;
Tolman v. Leonard, (1895) 6 App. D. C. 224; Alexander v.

Alexander, (1898) 13 App. D. C. 33-1. And, as the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia has more than once said:
"The allowance of alimony is not in the nature of an absolute
debt. It is not unconditional and unchangeable. It may be
changed in amount, even when in arrears, upon good cause
shown to the court having jurisdiction." 6 App. D. C. 233;
13 App. D. C. 352.
Under the Bankrupt Act of 1867, it was held by the District
Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York, in an able opinion by Judge Choate, (which is believed
to be the only one on the subject under that act) that a claim
for alimony, whether accrued before or after the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, was not a provable debt
nor barred by a discharge. _4 re lacemayer, (1878) 18 Nat.

reached in a careful opinion by Judge Lowell in the District

Court for the District of Massachusetts. In re Nowell, 99 Fed.
Rep. 931.
In JfZenzie v. Anderson, (1879) 65 Indiana, 239, the Supreme
Court of Indiana held that a judgment for alimony was not a
"debt growing out of or founded upon a contract, express or
implied," within the meaning of a statute exempting certain
property from execution for such a debt.
In Noyes v. Hubb5ard,(1892) 64: Vermont, 302, it was held by
the Supreme Court of Vermont that a decree for alimony, not
being a judgment for the enforcement of any contract, express
or implied, existing between the parties thereto, but for the enforcement of a duty in the performance of which the public as
well as the parties were interested, was not barred by a discharge
in insolvency.
In Romaine v. Chauncey, (1892) 129 N. Y. 566, it was held by
the Court of Appeals of New York that alimony was an allowance for support and maintenance, having no other purpose, and
provided for no other object; that it was awarded, not in payment of a debt, but in performance of the general duty of the
husband to support the wife, made specific and measured by the
decree of the court; and that a court of equity would not lend
its aid to compel the appropriation of alimony to the payment
of debts contracted by her before it was granted.
In Barclay v. Barclay, (1900) 184 Illinois, 375, it was adjudged
by the Supreme Court of Illinois that alimony could not be regarded as a debt owing from husband to wife, which might be
discharged by an order in bankruptcy, whether the alimony accrued before or after the proceedings in bankruptcy; and the
court said: "The liability to pay alimony is not founded upon
a contract, but is a penalty imposed for a failure to perform a
duty. It is not to be enforced by an action at law in the State
where the decree is entered, but is to be enforced by such proceedings as the chancellor may determine and adopt for its enforcement. It may be enforced by imprisonment for contempt,
without violating the constitutional provision prohibiting imprisonment for debt. The decree for alimony may be changed
from time to time by the chancellor, and there may be such circumstances as would authorize the chancellor to even change

the amount to be paid by the husband, where he is in arrears in
payments required under the decree. Hence such alimony cannot be regarded as a debt owing from the husband to the wife,
and, not being so, cannot be discharged by an order in the bankruptcy court."
In England, it seems to be the law that alimony is neither
discharged nor provable in bankruptcy. -Linton,v. Linton,,
(1885) 15 Q. B. D. 239; Hawkins v. Hlawkins, (1894) 1 Q. B.
25; Watkins v. Watkins, (1896) Prob. 222; -Yerr v. err,(1897)

the decision below, are recent decisions of District Courts, in
which the authorities above cited are not referred to. In ?-e

The result is that neither the alimony in arrear at the time
of the adjudication in bankruptcy, nor alimony accruing since
that adjudication, was provable in bankruptcy, or barred by the
discharge.
