OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

LOOKUIART v. JOHNSON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO.
No. 147. Argued March 22, 1901-Decided May 13, 1901.
Public lands belonging to the United States, for whose sale or other disposition Congress has made provision by general laws, are to be regarded
as legally open for entry and sale under such laws, unless some particular
lands have been withdrawn from sale by Congressional authority, or by
an executive withdrawal under such authority, either express or implied.
Under the act establishing the Court of Private Land Claims, public lands
belonging to the United States, though within the claimed limits of a
Mexican grant, became open to entry and sale.
If the provisions of the laws of New Mexico, in force when this location was
made, were not complied with, and another location is made before such
work was done, the new location is a valid location.
In the courts of the United States in action of ejectment the strict legal
title must prevail; and if the plaintiff have only equities, they must be
presented on the equity side of the court.
Although the plaintiff has no right to maintain this action, he ought not to
be embarrassed by a judgment here from pursuing any other remedy
against the defendants, or either of them that he may be advised.

THis was an action of ejectment brought by plaintiff in error
to recover certain mining property in the Territory of New
Mexico. The declaration alleges that the plaintiff, on July 10,
1893, was entitled to the possession of a certain mine, or deposit of mineral-bearing rock in place, situated in the Cochiti
mining district, in the county of Bernalillo and Territory of
New Mexico, and that while so in possession the defendants, on
October 1, 1893, entered into and upon the premises and have
ever since withheld the possession of the same from the plaintiff to his damage. All the defendants pleaded not guilty,
while Pilkey added a further plea that he was not at the time
of the commencement of the action in the possession of the
premises or any part thereof. The plaintiff demurred to this
second plea, and after argument the demurrer was overruled.
The parties went to trial upon these pleadings, and after the

LOCKHART v. JOHNSON.
Statement of the Case.

testimony had been taken the jury, under the instructions of
the court, found a verdict for the defendants. The plaintiff
appealed from the judgment entered upon the verdict to the
Supreme Court of the Territory, where it was affirmed, and he
thereupon sued out a writ of error from this court.
For the purpose of the trial the parties entered into the following stipulation:
"It is stipulated and agreed by and between the plaintiff and
defendants in the above-entitled cause that the premises in controversy in this case are situated within the limits of private
land claim reported as number 135 in the office of the surveyor
general of the Territory of New Mexico, known as the Canada
de Cochiti tract, as said claim was surveyed by the surveyor
general, said survey having been made and approved by Clarence Pullen, surveyor general, on the date of June 29, A. D. 1885.
"It is further stipulated that said private land claim was
never confirmed upon report of the surveyor general, but two
petitions for the confirmation of the same were filed in the
Court of Private Land Claims, one by Joel Parker Whitney,
Jos6 Juan Lucero, Laurino Lucero, Juan Cristoval Lucero, Jos&
de Jesus Lucero, Juan Toedora Lucero, Jos6 Telesforo Lucero,
Bernard S. 1Rodey, and Hannah Harris, being numbered 205 of
the docket of the Court of Private Land Claims at Santa F6,
and filed March 2, 1893; and the other petition being filed by
Manuel Hurtado and Jos6 Antonio Gallego on the 3d day of
March, 1893, and that said petitions were consolidated in said
cases heard, and decree of confirmation rendered by said court
on the 29th day of September, A. D. 1894, a compared copy of
which decree is attached to this stipulation.
"It is further stipulated and agreed that the said premises
in controversy in this case are not included within the boundaries
of said grant as confirmed by said decree.
"It is further stipulated and agreed that an appeal was taken
from said decree by all of the said petitioners to the Supreme
Court of the United States, in which court said cause is now
pending upon said appeal and undetermined, said appeal being
dated the 11th day of March, A. D. 1895.
"It is further stipulated and agreed that the official printed

copies of the reports of the surveyor-general to Congress upon
said private land claim and all documents attached thereto may
be used upon the trial of this cause to the same effect as if they
were the original documents and archives on file in the surveyor
general's office, subject, however, to such objection as the parties
may make upon other grounds."
The plaintiff also showed upon the trial that he and one Benjamin Johnson and the defendant Charles Pilkey on or about
P[ay 7, 1893, entered into an agreement at Albuquerque, New
fexico, by which they agreed to form a partnership for the
purpose of discovering, locating and operating mining claims,
Pilkey agreeing to prospect and locate such veins and lodes
and places as he might discover, containing valuable ores or
minerals, in the name and for the joint benefit of all the parties
to the agreement, in the proportion of one third interest to
himself and an undivided two thirds interest to the others.
They were to furnish him with tools, etc., and to pay him for
some portion of his labor upon the mines which he might discover. In pursuance of this agreement Pilkey started out and
among others discovered, took possession of and assumed to
locate the mine in question. It is claimed on the part of Lie
plaintiff that Pilkey, after taking possession of and locating the
mine, remained there from July 10, 1893, until some time in
October of that year, when in connection with several other
persons he entered into a conspiracy against his partners and
pursuant thereto ceased to do any work on the mine and permitted other persons (defendants herein) to take possession of
it and make a relocation thereof, and that they have retained
possession ever since.
Evidence was offered at the trial for the purpose of showing
these last stated facts, which, under the objection of the defendants, was ruled out and exceptions duly taken.
The defendants contended that the land in controversy was
at all times subject to the mining laws of the United States,
and that plaintiff did not comply with the provisions thereof or
of the laws of New Mexico applicable thereto, and that whatever right or title he ever had in the lands had expired and be-

come forfeited before the defendants took possession of the land
and long before the commencement of this action.
_Mr. J. H1. fcGowan for plaintiff in error.
Mr'. William B. Cibilders for defendants in error.
MR.JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the above statement of
facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
The first question to be determined in this case is one which
arises out of the facts set forth in the stipulation between the
parties, and that is, Did the lands which the plaintiff claims to
recover belong at the time of the location in 1893 to the United
States within the meaning of section 2319, Revised Statutes,
which provides that "all valuable mineral deposits in land belonging to the United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed,
are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and
purchase, by citizens of the United States," etc. ?
At the time of the location the record shows the parties believed the land was government land and not within the limits
of any Mexican grant. The stipulation shows, however, that
the lands were in fact within the limits of the private land claim
known as the Canada de Cochiti grant; that the grant was
never confirmed by Congress upon the report of the surveyor
general, and that two different sets of claimants under the grant
had filed their petitions in the Court of Private Land Claims at
Santa F6, one on the 2d and the other on the 3d day of March,
1893 ; that there was a decree of confirmation rendered by the
court on September 29, 1894, and in that decree of confirmation
the lands were not included within the boundaries of the grant
as confirmed by that decree. An appeal was taken therefrom
by all the parties to the Supreme Court of the United States,
where it was pending at the time the stipulation was entered
into, the appeal being dated March 11, 1895.
It therefore appears that at the time of the discovery and location of the lode in July, 1893, the Cochiti grant was before the

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

Court of Private Land Claims for adjudication, and the question
is whether by reason of that fact these lands were reserved from
entry and were not subject to the mineral laws of the United
States at that time. It will be noticed that before the trial of
this case the validity and extent of the Cochiti grant had been
decided by the Court of Private Land Claims, and this land was
thereby excluded from the limits of that grant. We know by
our own records that the decree of the Court of Private Land
Claims was affirmed in this court, in substance, in V'Aitney v.
United States, decided in M ay, 1897. 167 U. S. 529. The contention on the part of the plaintiff in error is that while the
Cochiti claim was before the Court of Private Land Claims, and
thereafter until its final determination by this court, no land
within its claimed limits could be entered upon under the mining laws of the United States, and if any such entry were in
fact made it was illegal and void, and gave no rights under the
mining laws to the parties so entering, and consequently plaintiff's possession was not subject to forfeiture under those laws.
In other words, that while the claim was sub judice all lands
within its limits as claimed were withdrawn and reserved from
entry under any of the laws pertaining to the sale or other disposition of the public lands of the United States, and that the
plaintiff, being in possession, had the right to retain it as against
defendants who entered without right or title, and were therefore mere trespassers.
Public lands belonging to the United States, for whose sale
or other disposition Congress has made provision by its general
laws, are to be regarded as legally open for entry and sale under
such laws, unless some particular lands have been withdrawn
from sale by Congressional authority or by an executive withdrawal under such authority, either expressed or implied. Wolsey v. Chapman, 101 U. S. 755, 769; Ifewitt v. Schultz, 180 U. S.
139. We must, therefore, refer to the action of Congress to
discover whether lands which in fact were public lands of the
United States were reserved from sale or other disposition under
its public laws because they were included within the claimed
limits but in fact were not within the actual limits of a grant
by the Spanish or Mexican authorities before the cession of the

LOCKHART v. JOHNSON.
Opinion of the Court.

territory by Mexico to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of February 2, 184:8. 9 Stat. 922. The eighth
and ninth articles of that treaty provide that the property of
every kind belonging to Mexicans in the ceded territory should
be respected by the government of the United States and their
title recognized.
By the act of July 22, 1854, c. 103, 10 Stat. 308, Congress
established the office of surveyor general of the Territory of
New Mexico, and in the eighth section of that statute it was
made the duty of that officer, under instructions from the Secretary of the Interior, to ascertain the origin, nature, character
and extent of all claims to lands under the laws, usages and
customs of Spain and Mexico. He was to make a full report
of all such claims as originated before the cession of the territory to the United States by the treaty above mentioned, with
his decision as to the validity or invalidity of each. This report
was to be laid before Congress for such action thereon as it
might deem just and proper, "and, until the final action of
Congress on such claims, all lands covered thereby shall be reserved from sale or other disposal by the government, and shall
not be subject to the donations granted by the previous provisions of this act."
The Cochiti grant came before the surveyor general pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1854, and therefore by the
terms of that portion of section eight, just quoted, the lands
were reserved from sale or other disposal by the government
until final action by Congress thereon. Up to March 3, 1891,
Congress had taken no action in regard to this grant and on
that day it passed the act establishing the Court of Private
Land Claims, 26 Stat. 854, c. 539; and by its fifteenth section
Congress in terms repealed the eighth section of the act of 1854,
"and all acts amendatory or in extension thereof, or supplementary thereto, and all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with
the provisions of this act." By this repeal, lands which were
in fact public lands belonging to the United States, although
within the claimed limits of a Mexican grant, became open to
entry and sale under the laws of the United States, unless, as
is the contention of plaintiff, such lands were reserved from

OCTOBER TERMA,

Opinion of the Court.

entry and sale or other disposition by the United States, by
reason of the provisions of the treaty with Mexico. We see
nothing in the terms of that treaty, either in the eighth or
ninth article, that could be construed as a withdrawal of lands
which in fact were the public lands of the United States, although contained within the claimed limits of some Mexican
grant made prior to the cession to the United States. The
mere fact that lands were claimed under a 1Mexican grant, when
such grant did not in truth cover them, would not by virtue of
any language used in the treaty operate to reserve such lands
from entry and sale.
We are aware that the land department has in some cases
taken a different view of this subject. In the Tumacacori and
Calabazasgrant, 16 L. D. 408, 423, the Secretary held that the
act of 1891, creating the court of Private Land Claims, did not
by its fifteenth section, "either by expression or necessary implication, revoke or annul the statutory reservations in force at
the time of its passage."
And in the Joseph F7arr claim, 24 L. D. 1, the Secretary held
that by the terms of the treaties between the United States and
the Republic of Mexico all lands embraced within the Mexican
and Spanish grants were placed in a state of reservation for the
ascertainment of the rights claimed under said grants, and that
the act of March 3, 1891, continued that reservation in force,
and that it would remain so until final action is taken on the
respective claims or grants affected thereby.
We cannot agree with these decisions. In the last case the
Secretary held, in opposition to the views expressed by his predecessor in the earlier case, that the lands were not reserved by
virtue of the statutory reservation under the act of 1854, because
that section was repealed by the fifteenth section of the act of
1891 without any qualification, and the repeal went to the entire section; but he held that, "Whatever may have been the
purpose of Congress in making said reservation, it is clear that
all lands embraced within the claimed limits of grants made by
Mexico or Spain prior to said treaty were in a state of reservation under the terms of the treaty itself, independent of any
reservation that might be made after such treaty was duly rati-

LOCKHART v. JOHNSON.
Opinion of the Court.

fled. It follows that the repeal of the section of the statute
containing the reservation would not have the effect of releasing
lands reserved under treaty obligations from such reservation."
As we have already stated, there are no words in the treaty
with Mexico expressly withdrawing from sale all lands within
the claimed limits of a Mexican grant, and we do not think there
is any language in the treaty which implies a reservation of
that kind. Whatever reservation there is must be looked for
in the statutes of the United States, and we are of opinion that
there is no such reservation and has been none since the repeal
of the eighth section of the act of 1854.
In Stoddard v. Chambers, 2 How. 284, the action was ejectment for lands in Missouri, the defendant claimed title under
a New Madrid certificate permitting location upon the public
lands which had been authorized to be sold under an act of Congress, approved February 15, 1811, by which the President was
authorized to sell public lands in the Territory of Louisiana, with
a proviso that "till after the decision of Congress thereon no
tract shall be offered for sale the claim to which has been in
due time, and according to law, presented to the recorder of
land titles in the district of Louisiana, and filed in his office, for
the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming lands in
the Territory of Louisiana."
From the time of the passage of that act up to May 26, 1829,
it was not questioned that all lands claimed under French or
Spanish title were reserved from sale by acts of Congress. On
May 26, 1829, this reservation ceased until it was revived by
the act of July 9, 1832, and was continued from that time until
the act of 1836. The defendant's patent was issued on July 16,
1832-after the time when the reservation was revived by the
act of July 9, 1832. In speaking of the location under his New
Madrid certificate by the defendant, the court said (at p. 318):
"His location was made on lands not liable to be thus appropriated, but expressly reserved; and this was the case when
his patent was issued. Had the entry been made, or the patent issued, after the 26th of May, 1829, when the reservation
ceased, and before it was revived by the act of 1832, the title

of the defendant could not be contested. But at no other interval of time, from the location of Bell, until its confirmation
in 1836, was the land claimed by him liable to be appropriated
in satisfaction of a New Xadrid certificate."
So in that case it appears that unless there were a reservation
of the land by Congressional action, it was not reserved in any
other way, and that during the interval of three years, when
the reservation by the act of Congress was not in operation, an
entry made during that time would have been valid, and the
title of the defendant thereunder could not have been contested.
Mineral lands are not supposed to have been granted under
ordinary Mexican grants of lands, and the act of 1891 j)rovides
that minerals do not pass by such grants, unless the grant claimed
to effect the donation or sale of such mines or minerals to the
grantee, or unless such grantee became otherwise entitled thereto in law or in equity; the mines and minerals remaining the
property of the United States, with the right of working the
same, but no mine was to be worked or any property confirmed
under the act of 1891 without the consent of the owner of such
property, until specially authorized thereto by an act of Congress thereafter to be passed. (Section 13, subdivision third,
act of 1891.) This provision makes it still plainer that, so far
as regards mineral lands, there was no intention after the passage of the act of 1891 that they should be reserved by a mere
claim in a Mexican grant of ordinary land.
Nor does the claim that the Cochiti grant was sub judice at
the time of the location of these lands affect their status as
public -lands belonging to the United States. They were not,
in fact, within the limits of the grant.
The case of Astiazaran v. Santa Rita 1and & fin ing Company, 148 U. S. 80, is not in point. In that case it was held that
a private claim to land in Arizona, under a Mexican grant which
had been reported to Congress by the surveyor general of the
territory, could not, before Congress had acted on the report, be
contested in the courts of justices. It was stated (p. 83) that,
"The case is one of those, jurisdiction of which has been committed to a particular tribunal, and which cannot, thereforeat least, while proceedings are pending before that tribunal-be

Opinion of the Court.

taken up and decided by any other." The court further said
that Congress having constituted itself the tribunal to finally
determine upon the report and recommendation of the surveyor
general whether the claim was valid or invalid, the proceedings
were pending until Congress acted, and while they were pending the question of the title of the petitioner could not be contested in the ordinary courts of justice. This is no such case.
There was no contest in any other court by which the validity
or extent of the grant pending for decision in the Court of
Private Land Claims could in any way be affected. No court
of justice had been appealed to for any such purpose. The
question was simply whether the land was public land open to
entry under the laws of the United States, and this was a question which parties might decide at the peril of having their acts
rendered of no avail if the decision of the Court of Private Land
Claims included those lands in the grant then before it.
Nor does the case of .NJewhall v. Snqager, 92 U. S. 7161, apply.
In that case it was held that lands within the boundaries of an
alleged I[exican or Spanish grant which was sub judice at the
time the Secretary of the Interier ordered a withdrawal of lands
along the route of the railroad, were not embraced in the Congressional grant to the company. The decision went upon the
ground that the legislation of Congress had been so shaped that
no title could be initiated under the laws of the United States
to lands covered by a Spanish or Mexican claim until it was
barred by lapse of time or rejected. The act of March 3, 1851,
9 Stat. 631, 633, sec. 13, which provides for the presentation
of claims under Mexican grants in California to the commission
established by the act, was referred to by the court, and it was
held that by reason of its provisions the lands were not public
lands under the laws of the United States until the claims thereto
had been either barred by lapse of time or rejected. The sixth
section of the act of 1853, March 3, 10 Stat. 244, 246, was also
referred to as expressly excepting all lands claimed under any
foreign grant or title. There was no such legislation existing
in regard to New Mexico at the time of the location of this
mining claim, July, 1893. The lands were in fact and have
been since their cession to this country public lands of the

Opinion of the Court.

United States, although during the period between the passage
of the act of 1854 and that of 1891 they were not open for sale
or other disposition while the claims to such lands were undetermined.
Being public land and since 1891 open to location under the
mining laws of the United States, it is further contended on the
part of defendants that the location of the claim made by Pilkey on July 10, 1893, in behalf of himself and his two partners,
Lockhart the plaintiff herein and Johnson, became forfeited by
reason of noncompliance with the mining statutes of the United
States and also the Territory of New Mexico, and that while
such failure to comply with the statutes continued, peaceable
possession of the land was taken and a relocation made by the
defendants, and whatever rights the plaintiff ever had under
the first location were thereby cut off.
The laws of New Mexico in force at the time when this location was made provide that a person desiring to locate a mining
claim must distinctly mark the location on the ground so that
its boundaries may be readily traced, and must post in some
conspicuous place on the ground a notice in writing stating the
names of the locators, their intention to locate the claim, giving
a description thereof by reference to some natural object or
permanent monument so as to identify it, and must also within
three months after such posting cause a copy of the notice to
be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which
the notice is posted. The locator must also within ninety days
from the date of taking possession of the claim sink a discovery
shaft upon the claim to a depth of at least ten feet from the
lowest part of the rim of such shaft at the surface, exposing
mineral in place, or he shall drive a tunnel, adit or open cut
upon such claim at least ten feet below the surface exposing
mineral in place. By the provisions of the act of 1889 the surface boundaries of all mining claims located must also be marked
by four substantial posts, or four substantial monuments of
stone set at each corner of the claim, and which posts or monuments must be plainly marked so as to indicate the direction
of the claim from each monument or post. Sec. 2286, Compiled
ILaws of N. M. 1897; sees. 1 and 2, chap. 25, Laws N. Al. 1889.

LOCKHART v. JOHNSON.
Opinion of the Court.

There is no pretence in the evidence that these things were
done other than the posting of a notice upon a pile of rocks at
some point within the claim. No work was done, no monuments or posts set, no discovery shaft sunk, nor any tunnel,
adit or open cut driven, as provided by law. It also appears
that some time about the last of September or the early part
of October, 1893, Pilkey, who was the only one of the partners who went to the land and stayed near it at any time, left
the neighborhood with his wife and came to Albuquerque and
remained there until November, 1893, and that while he was
absent and no one in possession of the land, and on or about
October 23, 1893, four of the original defendants, Fagaly,
Walker, Leeds and Johnson, located this claim and peaceably
entered upon and took possession of it.
If the statutes are not complied with by doing the work as
therein provided, and another locates before such work is done,
it is a valid location. Faxon v. Barna?.d,4 Fed. Rep. 702; Belk
v. ]eagher, 10- U. S. 279, 282.
It is undisputed that the requisite amount of work was not
done by the first locator, nor is there any dispute that he left
the mine, certainly early in October, 1893, and that there was
no one in possession of the land on the 23d of October, 1893,
when the above-named defendants entered upon the land,
peaceably took possession thereof and made their location, and
that in such location Pilkey did not join, and his name was absent from the notice, and he was not present when possession
was taken by the other defendants.
These undisputed facts are shown by the record, and upon
such evidence the court directed a verdict for the defendants.
The Supreme Court of the Territory has affirmed the judgment
entered upon this verdict, on the ground that the land was public land of the United States and open to location under the mineral laws thereof; that the failure of the original locator to
comply with the terms of the statutes of the United States and
of New Mexico by doing the work therein prescribed forfeited
all his rights under such location, and the peaceable location and
possession by others while such failure continued were valid, and
the plaintiff therefore showed no legal title to the mine, and con-

sequently could not recover in this action. Upon the facts thus
stated we think the Supreme Court was right.
In the course of the trial, however, while the cause was with
the plaintiff, he offered to show certain other and further facts
which he claimed entitled him to recover the lands as against
all the defendants. The defendants objected to the evidence
so offered on the ground that it was inadmissible and immaterial in this action, and the objection was sustained and the plaintiff duly excepted.
The facts which the plaintiff sought to prove are briefly
these: After IPilkey and the plaintiff and Johnson had entered
into their agreement, and while Pilkey was, pursuant to its provisions, engaged in prospecting, he discovered the mine in question and located it in the name of himself and his partners, and
thereafter and before the expiration of the ninety days in which
to do the necessary work on the claim he and the other defendants conspired together, and agreed that he should do no work
on the mine within the statutory time, and after the expiration
of that time and a forfeiture had been incurred by a failure to
comply with the statutes the other parties defendant should relocate the mine, comply -with the laws in regard to doing the
work upon it and thereby obtain the ownership thereof, and
that pursuant to such conspiracy he did neglect to do the necessary work within the statutory time, the defendants relocated
the mine, entered into the possession thereof and did the necessary work thereon and have remained in possession ever since.
The plaintiff, therefore, claims that Pilkey, being one of the
conspirators with the other defendants and also a copartner of
plaintiff, could not be a party to a hostile relocation of the mine,
and that any such relocation by others, under an agreement with
him, was illegal, and gave no right or title to defendants, and
that the prior possession of plaintiff, through his copartner,
continued in law, and, as against the defendants, such possession gave plaintiff a good title, they being on account of their
fraud mere trespassers upon the land.
Much of the testimony thus given is denied on the part of
Pilkey, but as all of it was rejected by the court we must assume
its truth for the purpose of determining the case.

LOCKHART v. JOHNSON.
Opinion of the Court.

It is clear that the statutes providing for a location of mining
lands were not complied with by Lockhart or his partners.
There is no dispute on that subject. When peaceable possession
of the mine which Pilkey had abandoned was taken and the
relocation was made by the defendants Fagaly, Walker, Leeds
and Johnson, and in their own names, whatever legal title to
the mine the plaintiff Lockhart had by virtue of the prior location by defendant Pilkey was cut off. The plaintiff has now
brought this purely legal action of ejectment, and must recover
upon the strength of his legal title, or not at all. It is undisputed that whatever possession Pilkey had ever taken of the
land in question had been in fact abandoned by him as early as
the first of October, 1893. Lockhart had never had any other
than constructive possession of the land based upon the alleged
actual possession of his copartner, and when the latter abandoned such actual possession, left the mine and came to Albuquerque, the constructive possession of plaintiff ceased at the
same moment. When the four defendants who took possession
of and relocated the mine went on the land on October 23, 1893,
they found it vacant, and when they took peaceable possession
of the vacant land before any resumption of work upon the
claim by plaintiff or in his behalf, the latter's legal title, whatever it had been, ceased. It is not a case, therefore, of a prior
possession under color of law or title being sufficient as against
an ouster by a mere trespasser. There has been no ouster, but
on the contrary a complete abandonment of possession. Whatever may be the equities of the plaintiff, in regard to this land
as against the defendants, he has certainly no legal title to the
mine or any part thereof, and in this purely legal action he must
fail.
In the courts of the United States in an action of ejectment
the strict legal title must prevail, and if the plaintiff have only
equities they must be presented and considered on the equity
side of the court. Foster v. .Jora, 98 U. S. 425, 428; Johnson
v. Christian, 128 U. S. 374, 382. The law of New -exico is to
the same effect. Compiled Laws of N. M. sec. 3160, and following sections.
Whatever the rights of the plaintiff may be, (and as to what

they are we express no opinion,) it is clear that on this record
he cannot maintain an action of ejectment. If he have rights
as a copartner or cotenant with Pilkey, and he claims that the
acts of the latter inure to his benefit in any way, his rights
under such circumstances can be enforced in equity. Turin r v.
Sawyer, 150 U. S. 578, 586.
In relation to mining, it has been held that the remedy in
the case of a claim in the nature of that which the plaintiff
herein sets up, is against the copartner or cotenant, by an action
for a breach of his contract or to establish and enforce a trust
in the claim as relocated against the parties relocating. Saunders v. . fackay, 5 Moontana, 59,3; Dohertyv. _Morris, 11 Colorado,
12.
In this case it will be seen that the relocation on behalf of
some of the defendants did not contain Pilkey's name, and
hence he never had any legal title under that location. ie denies that he had any interest in the mine under the relocation,
and asserts that it was not made in his interest or for his benefit.
Although the plaintiff has no right to maintain this action, yet
he ought not to be embarrassed by a judgment here from pursuing any other remedy against the defendants or either of them
that he may be advised ; and in order to avoid any complication
of that nature which possibly might result from an absolute affirmance of the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory,
we modify the terms of that judgment by providing that it is
entered without prejudice to the enforcement by other remedies,
of the rights, if any, which the plaintiff may have against the
parties defendant or either of them, and, as so modified, such
judgment is
.Affirmed.
