JUSTIcE SHIRAs

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case originated in proceedings to create and improve an
avenue or thoroughfare known as Douglas boulevard, in the
town of West Chicago.
The full history of those proceedings, contained in the statement of facts made by this court in the case of Zombard and
ot, eis v. The IFest Chicago Park Comm issioners, recently decided, renders it unnecessary to repeat them here. And the
legal questions involved were so fully discussed in that case,
and in FrZ'ench v. Barber Asphalt Co. and TFigltd v. Davidson,
cognate cases decided at the present term of this court, that we
are relieved from their further consideration.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois
is
Affrmed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, (with whom concurred
and MR. JUSTICE MoKENNA) dissenting.

MR. JusTrIcE1

WHITE

The controlling question in this case' is the same as is presented in Frenchv. BarberAsphalt Paving Co., ante, 324, W|ig/it
v. Davidson, ante, 371, and Tonawanda v. Lyon, ante, 389. For
the reasons stated in my opinions in those cases, I dissent from
the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.
