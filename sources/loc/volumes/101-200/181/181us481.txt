BARKER v. HARVEY.
QUEVAS v. HARVEY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CA.LIFORNIA.
Nos. 209, 210. Argued

arch 20, 21, 1901.-Decided May 13, 1901.

The facts in these two cases are so nearly alike that the court thinks it sufficient to consider only the first. The land there in question is within
the limits of the territory ceded to the United States by the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. The plaintiffs claim title by virtue of a patent issued in confirmation of two grants made by the Mexican government.
The defendants, without claiming the fee, claim a right of permanent
occupancy, as Mission Indians, who had been in occupation of the premises long before the Mexican grants. Held:
(1) That the United States were bound to respect the rights of private
property in the ceded territory, but that it had the right to require
reasonable means for determining the validity of all titles within
the ceded territory, to require all persons having claims to lands to
present them for recognition, and to decree that all claims which
are not thus presented, shall be considered abandoned:
(2) That so far as the Indians are concerned, the land was rightfully to
be regarded as part of the public domain, and subject to sale and
disposition by the government:
(3) That if the Indians had any claims founded on the action of the Mexican government, they abandoned them by not presenting them to
the commission for consideration:
(4) That lands which were burdened with a right of permanent occupancy
were not a part of the public domain, subject to the full disposal
by the United States.
Some discussion appears in the briefs as to the meaning of the word "ser'
vidumbres," (translated -usages'). The court declines to define its
meaning when standing by itself, but holds that in these grants it does
not mean that the general occupation and control of the property was
limited by them, but only that such full control should not be taken as
allowing any interference with established roads or cross roads, or other
things of like nature.

cases were brought by defendants in error in the superior court of the county of San Diego, California, to quiet
their title to certain premises in that county. Decrees rendered in their favor were carried to the Supreme Court of the

State, and by that court affirmed. 126 California, 262. To
such affirmance these writs of error have been sued out.
The facts in the cases are so nearly alike that it is sufficient
to consider only the first. The land in question is within the
limits of the territory ceded to the United States by the treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848. 9 Stat. 922. Generally speaking, the plaintiffs claim title by virtue of a patent
issued to John J. Warner on January 16, 1880, in confirmation
of two grants made by the Mexican government. On the other
hand, the defendants do not claim a fee in the premises but
only a right of permanent occupancy by virtue of the alleged
fact that they are Mission Indians, so called, and had been in
occupation of the premises long before the Mexican grants, and,
of course, before any dominion acquired by this government
over the territory ; insisting, further, that the government of
Mexico had always recognized the lawfulness and permanence
of their occupancy, and that such right of occupancy was protected by the terms of the treaty and the rules of international
law.
The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided in article 8 as
follows:
"AI'rcoLE VIII.
"'Mexicans now established in territories previously belonging to Mexico, and which remain for the future within the
limits of the United States, as defined by the present treaty,
shall be free to continue where they now reside, or to remove
at any time to the Mexican republic, retaining" the property
which they possess in the said territories, or disposing thereof,
and removing the proceeds wherever they please, without their
being subjected, on this account, to any contribution, tax or
charge whatever.
"Those who shall prefer to remain in the said territories may
either retain the title and rights of Mexican citizens, or acquire
those of citizens of the United States. But they shall be under
the obligation to make their election within one year from the
date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty; and those
who shall remain in the said territories after the expiration of
that year, without having declared their intention to retain the

Statement of the Case.

character of Mexicans, shall be considered to have elected to
become citizens of the United States.
"In the said territories, the property of every kind, now
belonging to Mexicans not established there, shall be inviolably
respected. The present owners, the heirs of these, and all Mexicans who may hereafter acquire said property by contract, shall
enjoy with respect to it guaranties equally ample as if the same
belonged to citizens of the United States."
Article 10, as originally prepared, was stricken out by the
Senate, but in the protocol signed by the representatives of the
two nations, at the time of the ratification, on May 26, 1848, it
was stated:
"2d. The American government by suppressing the tenth
article of the treaty of Guadalupe did not in any way intend
to annul the grants of lands made by Mexico in the ceded territories. These grants, notwithstanding the suppression of the
article of the treaty, preserve the legal value which they may
possess, and the grantees may cause their legitimate (titles) to
be acknowledged before the American tribunals.
"Conformably to the law of the United States, legitimate
titles to every description of property, personal and real, existing in the ceded territory, are those which were legitimate titles
under the Mexican law in California and New Mexico, up to
the 13th of May) 1846, and in Texas up to the 2d March, 1836."

After the acquisition of this territory Congress, on March 3,
1851, c. 41, 9 Stat. 631, passed an act entitled "An act to ascertain and settle the private I-and claims in the State of California," which created a commission to receive and act upon all
petitions for confirmation of such claims. Its decision was subject to appeal to the District Court of the United States, and
thence to this court. As originally organized the commission
was to continue for three years, but that time was extended by
subsequent legislation. Sections 8, 13, 15 and 16 are as follows:
"Sc. 8. That each and every person claiming lands in California by virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish
or Mexican government shall present the same to the said commissioners when sitting as a board, together with such docu-

mentary evidence and testimony of witnesses as the said claimant
relies upon in support of such claims; and it shall be the duty
of the commissioners, when the case is ready for hearing, to
proceed promptly to examine the same upon such evidence, and
upon the evidence produced in behalf of the United States, and
to decide upon the validity of the said claim, and, within thirty
days after such decision is rendered, to certify the same, with
the reasons on which it is founded, to the District Attorney of
the United States in and for the district in which such decision
shall be rendered."
':SEc. 13. That all lands, the claims to which have been
finally rejected by the commissioners in the manner herein
provided, or which shall be finally decided to be invalid by the
District or Supreme Court, and all lands the claims to which
shall not have been presented to the said commissioners within
two years after the date of this act, shall be deemed, held and
considered as part of the public domain of the United States;
and for all claims finally confirmed by the said commissioners,
or by the said District or Supreme Court, a patent shall issue
to the claimant upon his presenting to the General Land Office
an authentic certificate of such confirmation, and a plat or survey of the said land, duly certified and approved by the surveyor general of California, whose duty it shall be to cause all
private claims which shall be finally confirmed to be accurately
surveyed, and to furnish plats of the same; and in the location
of the said claims the said surveyor general shall have the same
power and authority as are conferred on the register of the land
office and receiver of the public moneys of Louisiana, by the
sixth section of the act 'to create the office of surveyor of the
public lands for the State of Louisiana,' approved third March,

That if the title of the claimant to such lands shall be contested
by any other person, it shall and may be lawful for such person
to present a petition to the District Judge of the United States

to hear and determine the same, a copy of which petition shall
be served upon the adverse party thirty days before the time ap-

pointed for hearing the same: And provided, further, That it
shall and may be lawful for the District Judge of the United
States, upon the hearing of such petition, to grant an injunction to restrain the party at whose instance the claim to the
said lands has been confirmed, from suing out a patent for the
same, until the title thereto shall have been finally decided, a
copy of which order shall be transmitted to the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, and thereupon no patent shall issue
until such decision shall be made, or until sufficient time shall,
in the opinion of the said Judge, have been allowed for obtaining the same; and thereafter the said injunction shall be dissolved."
"Sic. 15. That the final decrees rendered by the said commissioners, or by the District or Supreme Court of the United
States, or any patent to be issued under this act, shall be conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only,
and shall not affect the interests of third persons.
"SEc. 16. That it shall be the duty of the commissioners
herein provided for to ascertain and report to the Secretary of
the Interior the tenure by which the mission lands are held, and
those held by civilized Indians, and those who are engaged in
agriculture or labor of any kind, and also those which are occupied and cultivated by Pueblos or Rancheros Indians."
On the trial before the court, without a jury, the findings of
fact were in substance that the plaintiffs had the ownership in
fee simple of the premises described; that the defendants had
no rights or interest therein, and the decree was in accordance
therewith. The statement on appeal prepared by the trial court
disclosed that the plaintiffs introduced in evidence the patent to
John J. Warner, which patent recited the filing of a petition by
Warner with the land commission praying for confirmation of
his title, a title based on two Mexican grants-one June 8, 1840,
to Jos6 Antonio Pico by Juan B. Alvarado, then constitutional
governor of the Californias, and the second, November 28, 1844,
to petitioner by Manual Micheltorena, governor general commandant and inspector general of the Californias; recited also
a decree of confirmation of such title, an appeal to the District
Court of the United States and an affirmance of the decision of

the commission, the return of the surveyor general of the State
showing a survey; and conveyed the premises to Warner, "but
with the stipulation that in virtue of the fifteenth section of the
said act neither the confirmation of this claim nor this patent
shall affect the interests of third persons." It was admitted
that Warner's title had passed to plaintiffs, and that the taxes
had all been paid by them. On the other hand, the appeal
statement showed that the defendants offered copies of the expedientes of both of the grants referred to in the patent, and
also oral testimony of occupation by the defendants and their
ancestors. Some witnesses were introduced by the plaintiffs
to contradict this matter of occupancy, but on final consideration the court struck out all the testimony in reference to occupancy and of the Mexican grants upon which the patent was
issued. Upon the evidence, therefore, that was received by the
trial court there could be no doubt of the rightfulness of the
decree, and the question presented by the record to the Supreme
Court of the State was whether there was error in striking out
the testimony offered on behalf of the defence.

JuSTisE

BPEWEn, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Undoubtedly by the rules of international law, and in accordance with the provisions of the treaty between the Mexican
government and this country, the United States were bound to
respect the rights of private property in the ceded territory.
But such obligation is entirely consistent with the right of this
Government to provide reasonable means for determining the
validity of all titles within the ceded territory, to require all
persons having claims to lands to present them for recognition,

BARKER v. HARVEY.
Opinion of the Court.

and to decree that all claims which are not thus presented shall
be considered abandoned. "Undoubtedly private rights of property within the ceded territory were not affected by the change
of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and were entitled to protection,
whether the party had the full and absolute ownership of the
land, or merely an equitable interest therein, which required
some further act of the Government to vest in him a perfect
title. But the duty of providing the mode of securing these
rights, and of fulfilling the obligations imposed upon the JUnited
States by the treaties, belonged to the political department of
the Government; and Congress might either itself discharge
that duty or delegate it to the judicial department. .Dela Cioix

2 How. 344, 374; Tameling v. United States Freehold Co., 93
U. S. 644, 661; Botiller v. Doninguez, 130 U. S. 238." Astiazaran v. Santa Rita Land& X i.ing Co., 148 U. S. 80, 81.
Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U. S.238, the last case cited in
the foregoing quotation, deserves special notice. The Supreme
Court of California had held in several cases that a perfect title
need not be presented to the land commission; that it was
recognized by the treaty of cession, and required no further
confirmation; that the act to ascertain and settle private land
claims applied only to those titles which were imperfect and
needed the action of some tribunal to ascertain and establish
their validity. But in this case, which came from the Supreme
Court of California, we held the contrary. We quote at some
length from the opinion. Thus, on page 246, it was said:
"Two propositions under this statute are presented by counsel
in support of the decision of the Supreme Court of California.
The first of these is, that the statute itself is invalid, as being
in conflict with the provisions of the treaty with Mexico, and
violating the protection which was guaranteed by it to the property of Mexican citizens, owned by them at the date of the treaty;
and also in conflict with the rights of property under the Constitution and laws of the United States, so far as it may affect
titles perfected under Mexico. The second proposition is, that
the statute was not intended to apply to claims which were
supported by a complete and perfect title from the Mexican

OCTOBER TERMT, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

government, but, on the contrary, only to such as were imperfect, inchoate and equitable in their character, without being a
strict legal title.
"With regard to the first of these propositions it may be
said, that so far as the act of Congress is in conflict with the
treaty with Mexico, that is a matter in which the court is bound
to follow the statutory enactments of its own Government. If
the treaty was violated by this general statute enacted for the
purpose of ascertaining the validity of claims derived from the
Mexican government, it was a matter of international concern,
which the two States must determine by treaty, or by such other
means as enables one State to enforce upon another the obligations of a treaty. This court, in a class of cases like the present,
has no power to set itself up as the instrumentality for enforcing the provisions of a treaty with a foreign nation which the
Government of the United States, as a sovereign power, chooses
to disregard. Tue Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616; Taylor v.
.Aorion, 2 Curtis, 454:; Head .lfoney Cases, 112 U. S.580, 598;
Whitney v. Robertson, 124: U. S.190, 195."
In reference to the second proposition, after noticing several
provisions of the statute, it was declared (p. 248):
"It is not possible, therefore, from the language of this statute, to infer that there was in the minds of its framers any distinction as to the jurisdiction they were conferring upon this
board, between claims derived from the Spanish or Mexican
government, which were perfect under the laws of those governments, and those which were incipient, imperfect or inchoate.
It was equally important to the object which the United
States had in the passage of it, that claims under perfect grants
from the Mexican government should be established as that
imperfect claims should be established or rejected.
"The superior force which is attached, in the argument of
counsel, to a perfect grant from the Mexican government had
its just influence in the board of commissioners or in the courts
to which their decisions could be carried by appeal. If the title
was perfect, it would there be decided by a court of competent
jurisdiction, holding that the claim thus presented was valid;
if it was not, then it was the right and the duty of that court

BARKER v. HARVEY.
Opinion of the Court.

to determine whether it was such a claim as the United States
was bound to respect, even though it was not perfect as to all
the forms and proceedings under which it was derived. So that
the superior value of a perfected Mexican claim had the same
influence in a court of justice which is now set up for it in an
action where the title is contested.
"Nor can it be said that there is anything unjust or oppressive
in requiring the owner of a valid claim, in that vast wilderness
of lands unclaimed, and unjustly claimed, to present his demands
to a tribunal possessing all the elements of judicial functions,
with a guarantee of judicial proceedings, so that his title could
be established if it was found to be valid, or rejected if it was
invalid.
"We are unable to see any injustice, any want of constitutional power, or any violation of the treaty, in the means by
which the United States undertook to separate the lands in
which it held the proprietary interest from those which belonged,
either equitably or by a strict legal title, to private persons.
Every person owning land or other property is at all times liable to be called into a court of justice to contest his title to it.
This may be done by another individual, or by the government
under which he lives. It is a necessary part of a free government, in which all are equally subject to the laws, that whoever
asserts rights or exercises powers over property may be called
before the proper tribunals to sustain them."
The views thus expressed have been several times reaffirmed
by this court, the latest case being _Floridav. Fuwrman, 180 U. S.
402, in which, after quoting the passage last above quoted, we
said, in reference to statutes of the United States respecting
claims in Florida (p. 438):
"We are of opinion that these acts applied and were intended
to apply to all claims, whether perfect or imperfect, in that particular resembling the California act; that the courts were bound
to accept their provisions ; and that there was no want of constitutional power in prescribing reasonable limitations operating
to bar claims if the course pointed out were not pursued."
See also Tliompson v. -Los Angeles -Farming&c. Co., 180 U. S.
72, 77, in which it was said in reference to the statute before us:

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

"Every question which could arise on the title claimed could
come to and receive judgment from this court. The scheme of
adjudication was made complete and all the purposes of an act
to give repose to titles were accomplished. And it was certainly the purpose of the act of 1851 to give repose to titles. It
was enacted not only to fulfil our treaty obligations to individuals, but to settle and define what portion of the acquired territory was public domain. It not only permitted but required all
claims to be presented to the board, and barred all from future
assertion which were not presented within two years after the
date of the act. Sec. 13. The jurisdiction of the board was
necessarily commensurate with the purposes of its creation,
and it was a jurisdiction to decide rightly or wrongly. If
wrongly a corrective was afforded, as we have said, by an appeal by the claimant or by the United States to the District
Court."
These rulings go far toward sustaining the decision of the Supreme Court of California in the present cases. As between
the United States and Warner, the patent is as conclusive of
the title of the latter as any other patent from the United States
is of the title of the grantee named therein. As between the
United States and the Indians, their failure to present their
claims to the land commission within the time named made the
land within the language of the statute " part of the public domain of the United States." "Public domain" is equivalent to
"public lands," and these words have acquired a settled meaning in the legislation of this country. "The words 'public lands'
are habitually used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale or other disposal under general laws." -Yewhall v.
Sangee, 92 U. S. 61, 763. "The grant is of alternate sections
of public land, and by public land, as it has been long settled, is
meant such land as is open to sale or other disposition under
general laws." Bardon v. Northern Pacific Railroad Co., 145
U. S. 535, 538. See also .Mann,v. Tacoma Land Co., 153 U. S.
273, 284. So far, therefore, as these Indians are concerned the
land is rightfully to be regarded as part of the public domain
and subject to sale and disposal by the Government, and the Government has conveyed to Warner. It is true that the patent,

BARKER v. HARVEY.
Opinion of the Court.

following the fifteenth section of the act, in terms provides that
the patent shall not "affect the interests of third persons," but
who may take advantage of this stipulation?. This question
was presented and determined in Beard v. _Federy, 3 Wall. 478,
and the court, referring to the effect of a patent, said (pp. 492,
493):
"When informed, by the action of its tribunals and officers,
that a claim asserted is valid and entitled to recognition, the
government acts, and issues its patent to the claimant. This instrument is, therefore, record evidence of the action of the government upon the title of the claimant. By it the government
declares that the claim asserted was valid under the laws of
Mexico; that it was entitled to recognition and protection by
the stipulations of the treaty, and might have been located under
the former government, and is correctly located now, so as to
embrace the premises as they are surveyed and described. As
against the government this record, so long as it remains unvacated, is conclusive. . . . The term' third persons,' as
there used, does not embrace all persons other than the United
States and the claimants, but only those who hold superior titles,
such as will enable them to resist successfully any action of the
government in disposing of the property."
If these Indians had any claims founded on the action of the
Mexican government they abandoned them by not presenting
them to the commission for consideration, and they could not,
therefore, in the language just quoted, "resist successfully any
action of the government in disposing of the property." If it
be said that the Indians do not claim the fee, but only the right
of occupation, and, therefore, they do not come within the provision of section 8 as persons "claiming lands in California by
virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican
government," it may be replied that a claim of a right to permanent occupancy of land is one of far-reaching effect, and it
could not well be said that lands which were burdened with a
right of permanent occupancy were a part of the public domain
and subject to the full disposal of the United States. There is
an essential difference between the power of the United States
over lands to which it has had full title, and of which it has

OCTOBER

"'ERAT,

Opinion of the Court.

given to an Indian tribe a temporary occupancy, and that over
lands which were subjected by the action of some prior government to a right of permanent occupancy, for in the latter case
the right, which is one of private property, antecedes and is
superior to the title of this government, and limits necessarily
its power of disposal. Surely a claimant would have little reason for presenting to the land commission his claim to land,
and securing a confirmation of that claim, if the only result
was to transfer the naked fee to him, burdened by an Indian
right of permanent occupancy.
Again, it is said that the Indians were, prior to the cession,
the wards of the Mexican government, and by the cession became the wards of this government; that, therefore, the United
States are bound to protect their interests, and that all administration, if not all legislation, must be held to be interpreted
by, if not subordinate to, this duty of protecting the interests
of the wards. It is undoubtedly true that this government has
always recognized the fact that the Indians were its wards, and
entitled to be protected as such, and this court has uniformly
construed all legislation in the light of this recognized obligation. But the obligation is one which rests upon the political
department of the government, and this court has never assumed, in the absence of Congressional action, to determine
what would have been appropriate legislation, or to decide the
claims of the Indians as though such legislation had been had.
Our attention has been called to no legislation by Congress
having special reference to these particular Indians. By the
act creating the land commission the commissioners were required (sec. 16) "to ascertain and report to the Secretary of the
Interior the tenure by which the mission lands are held, and
those held by civilized Indians, and those who are engaged in
agriculture or labor of any kind, and also those which are occupied and cultivated by Pueblos or Rancheros Indians." It is
to be assumed that the commissioners performed that duty,
and that Congress, in the discharge of its obligation to the Indians, did all that it deemed necessary, and as no action has
been shown in reference to these particular Indians, or their
claims to these lands, it is fairly to be deduced that Congress

BARKER v. HARVEY.
Opinion of the Court.

considered that they had no claims which called for special
action.
But we are not compelled to rest upon any presumptions
from the inaction of Congress. Turning to the testimony offered in respect to the matter of occupation, it may be stated
that there was sufficient to call for a finding thereon if the fact
of occupation was controlling. But in the Mexican grants
upon which Warner based his application to the commission
for a confirmation of his title we notice these things: The first
grant was in 1840, to Jos6 Antonio Pico. The application was
for "the place 'Agua Caliente,' belonging to the mission of
San Luis iRey, since it is not needed by the said mission, having
a house on it, and an orchard of little utility." The report of
the justice of the peace was "that the land ' Agua Caliente' is
the property of the San Luis Rey Mission, which has improvements, buildings and an orchard, from which derive their subsistence the Indians who live thereon, which is bounded by the
property of Joaquin Ortega, and I believe it can be awarded to
the interested party for being worthy, but without prejudice to
the Indians, who from it derive their support."
The last paper in the expediente was the following:
"Juan B. Alvarado, Constitutional Governor of the Department of both alifornias:
"Whereas Jos6 Antonio Pico has petitioned for his own personal benefit and that of his family the land known by the name
of 'Agua Caliente,' bounded by the ranch of 'San Jos6 Valley,' with the boundary of the canyon of ' Buena Vista,' and
by the mountains of 'Palomar,' having previously complied with
the writs and investigations corresponding, as required by the
laws and regulations, exercising the powers which are conferred
on me in the name of the Mexican nation, I have resolved to
grant to him the said place, subjecting himself to pay for the
place of worship and other improvements that be there, belonging to the San Luis Rey Mission, and not molest (prejudicar)
the Indians that thereon may be established, and to the approbation of the most excellent assembly of the department, and
to the conditions following, to wit:

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

"First. Ie is allowed to fence it in, without interfering with
the roads, cross roads and other usages (servidumbres); he will
possess it fully and exclusively, turning it to agricultural or any
other use he may see fit, but within a year he shall construct a
house thereon and live in it.
"Second. When the property shall have been confirmed to
him, he shall petition the respective judge to give him possession thereof, by virtue of this order, and shall mark out the
boundaries on whose limits he shall fix the landmarks, some
fruit and wild trees that may be of some utility.
"Third. The land of which donation is hereby made is of
the extent mentioned in the plan, which goes with the 'expediente.' The judge who should give possession theeof shall
have it surveyed according to law, leaving the residue that may
result to the nation for other purposes.
"Fourth. If he should fail to comply with these conditions,
he shall forfeit his title to the land, and it will be denounceable by another.
"Therefore, I command that this present order be to him
the title, and holding it for good and valid, a copy thereof be
entered into the proper book, and given to the party interested
for his protection and other purposes."
Lo approval of this grant by the departmental assembly
appears of record, but the finding of the commission was that
whatever of right passed to Pico was transferred by conveyances to Warner. The second grant, that in 1845, was made
directly to Warner, upon his personal application, which application was thus endorsed.

the powers conferred on me in the name of the Mexican nation, I have resolved to grant him the said land, declaring it by
these presents his property, subject to the approbation of the
most excellent assembly of the department, and to the conditions following, to wit:
"First. He will not be allowed to sell it, to alienate it, nor
to mortgage it, to place it under bond, or to place it under any
obligation, nor give it away.
"Second. He will be allowed to fence it in, without interference with the roads, and other usages (servidumbres). He will
hold it freely and exclusively, turning it to agriculture, or any

other use he may please, and he shall build a house on it within
one year, and live in it.
"Third. le shall apply to the respective judge to give him
judicial possession thereof, by virtue of this order, by which he
shall mark out the boundaries whereon he shall place the stakes,
some fruit and wild trees of some use or other.
"Fourth. The land which is being granted consists of six
leagues, more or less (seis sitios de ganado mayor) according to
the respective map or plan. The judge who may give possession thereof shall have it surveyed according to law, leaving the
residue (sobrante) to the nation for its use.
"Fifth. Should he fail to comply with these conditions, he
shall forfeit his right to the land, and it will be denounceable
by another. Therefore I order that this present decree be to
him his title, and holding it for good and valid notice thereof
be entered into the respective books and be given to the interested party for his protection and other purposes."
The grant was subsequently approved by the departmental
assembly on May 21, 1845. On the application to the Private
Land Commission the matter was investigated, and a report
made by Commissioner Felch, in these words:
"J. J J Warner v. The United States, for the place called Agua
Caliente y Valle de San Jos6, in San Diego County, containing
six square leagues of land.
"Two grants are presented and proved in this case: The first
made by Governor Juan B. Alvarado to Jos6 Antonio Pico, on
the 8th day of June, 1840; the other by Governor Manuel
Micheltorena, on the 28th day of November, 1844, to the present claimant. The land embraced in the grant to Pico is designated by the name Agua Caliente, and that described in the
grant to Warner is called the Valle de San Jos6. On comparing the descriptions of the two parcels of lands and maps which
constitute portions of the two expedientes, it is manifest that
the grant to Warner embraces the premises described in the
previous grant to Pico. The place known by the name of Agna
Caliente constitutes the northern portion of the valley known
by the name of San Jos6, while the grant to Warner describes the
entire valley, and the witnesses testify that the rancho claimed

by Warner is known by these names, but more frequently it has
recently been called Warner's rancho. The testimony shows
that Pico had set out some vines on the place before the grant
was made to him, and that he built a house on the place after
the grant, but in 1842 he left the place, probably on account of
the danger from the Indians, and does not appear to have done
anything more in connection with it.
"The proof is scarcely sufficient to establish the performance
of the conditions of the grant by him, while his absence from
the place, and the want of any evidence of an attempt to return
to it after 1842, indicates an abandonment of it. It was so
treated by Warner in petitioning for a grant of the same in 1844,
and by the governor in making the concession to him. If, however, there was any remaining interest in said Pico by virtue of
the grant to him, the present claimant has succeeded to that
interest by virtue of a conveyance made to him by said Pico on
the thirteenth day of January, 1852. This conveyance is given
in evidence.
"I think, however, that the right of the present claimant
must be determined entirely by the merits of the case based on
Micheltorena's grant to him.
"This grant was approved by the departmental assembly
May 21, 1845.
"The testimony of Andres Pico shows that Warner was living with his family on the place in the fall of 1844 and cultivating portions of the land.
"His residence on the place appears to have been continued
until 1851, when the Indians burnt his buildings and destroyed
his stock. Since that time his occupation has been continued
by his servants.
"In the grant, the description of the land petitioned for is
such as to embrace the entire valley called San Jos6, as laid
down on the map constituting a part of the expediente, giving
well-defined landmarks and boundaries, which the witnesses
testify are well-known objects.
"The valley is very irregular in shape and is surrounded by
high hills.
"Juridical measurement was required and the quantity of six

square leagues was granted, but as the measurement was never
obtained, it is important to determine whether the grantee is
entitled to hold the entire premises described in the grant;
using the scale given on the desino referred to in the grant, the
quantity included in the premises cannot exceed six square
leagues of land.
"The testimony of the witnesses who were interrogated on
the subject estimate it variously; some more and some less than
the quantity conceded. On an examination of the whole case,
however, we are inclined to the opinion that the petitioner
should have a confirmation of the premises according to the
description contained in the grant to him, and a decree will be
entered accordingly."
Upon that report the title was confirmed, which, as heretofore stated, was approved by the District Court, and thereupon
a patent was issued.
From these papers the following appears: The grant to Pico
was made subject to the condition that he should "not molest
the Indians that thereon may be established." No such condition was attached to the subsequent grant to Warner. On the
contrary, the report of the justice of the peace was that the
land had been for two years vacant and abandoned; that there
were some property rights vested, not in the Indians, but in the
Mission of San Diego, and the official of that mission consented
to the grant, inasmuch as the mission had no means to cultivate and occupy the land, and it was no longer necessary for
its purposes.
Some discussion appears in the briefs as to the meaning of
the word translated "usages" (servidumbres) which appears in
both grants, and it is contended by the plaintiffs in error that
it is equivalent to the English word "servitudes," and isbroad
enough to include every right which any one may have in respect to the premises, subordinate to the fee. We shall not attempt to define the meaning of the word standing by itself.
It may be conceded that it was sometimes used to express all
kinds of servitudes, including therein a paramount right of occupation, but the context seems to place a narrower meaning
upon its use here. Thus, in the first grant not only is there

BARKER v. HARVEY.

Opinion of the Court.

the distinct provision that the Indians established on the land
shall not be molested, but the grantee "is allowed to fence it
in without interfering with the roads, cross roads, and other
usages" (servidumbres). In the second the grantee is "allowed
to fence it in without interference with the roads and other
usages" (serviduinbres). Obviously, it is in these two clauses
contemplated that the fencing is to be without interference
with roads and other usages or burdens. It does not mean
that the general occupation and control of the property is limited by any so-called servidumbres, but only that such full control shall not be taken as allowing any interference with established roads or cross roads, or other things of like nature.
It thus appears that prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had abandoned
the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the Mission
of San Diego, and made an absolute grant, subject only to the
condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have.
How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made
by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition
by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians?
On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it
was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in
the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only to
the rights of such mission.
For these reasons we are of opinion that there was no error
in the rulings of the Supreme Court of California, and its judgments in the two cases are
