Mr..

JUSTiE PEcKaAM

delivered the opinion of the court.

This 4 another of the same character of actions as those
above disposed of. Hall was one of the contractors for doing
work of the same nature, and filed his petition under the act
of 1880 in December of that year. In that petition he alleged
that he had done certain work and that he was paid for his
work, under his contract, by certain certificates which were
worth only fifty per cent of their face value, and which he
consented to receive only at that rate, and he asked for judgment for the other fifty per cent of his contract ptice. He
failed in the primary object of that suit, but he did recover
on some other ground a small judgment of about one thousand dollars, which was entered June 1, 1885. Subsequently,
and in pursuance of the act of 1895, he applied for a new trial
for the purpose of claiming the "board rates" compensation
for the work done by him at contract prices, under circumstances mentioned in the foregoing cases. The Court of
Claims gave judgment in his favor f.r that difference between
the two rates, and found that under the true intent and meaning of the acts of 1895 and 1880 the sum for which it gave
judgment "became due and payable on the 1st of January,
1877," which Was the date when the plaintiff had- completed
his work under the contract. 31 0. Cl.376.
