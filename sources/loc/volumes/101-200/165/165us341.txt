HOPKINS -v. GRIMSHAW
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 18. Argued December 16, 17, 1895.-Decided February 15, 189T.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the acts of July 2, 1864, cc. 210, 222
(rednacted in Rev. Stat. § 858, and Rev. Stat. D. C. §§ 876877), a widow
is incompetent to testify, in a suit which she is neither a party to, nor
interested in, to a private conversation between her husbfild and herself
in his lifetime; and a conversation between them in their own home, in
the presence of no one but a young daughter, who does not appear to
have taken any part in it, is a private conversation, within the rule.
The rule against perpetuities is inapplicable to a trust resulting to the heirs
of a grantor upon the failure of.an express trust declared in his deed.
By a deed of land from a private person to three others as trustees for a
particular society, not incorporated, but formed for the mutual aid of its
members when sick and for their burial when dead, to have and to hold
to the trustees, "and their successors in office forever, for the sole use
and benefit of the society aforesaid, for a burial ground, and for no other
purpose whatever," the trustees take the legal estate in fee; and, when
the land has ceased to be used for a burial ground, and all the bodies
there interred have been removed to other cemeteries, by order of the
municipal authorities, and the society has been dissolved and become extinct, the grantor's heirs are entitled to the land by way of resulting
trust; and, after one of those heirs and the heirs of the trustees have
conveyed their interests in the land to another person, the other hirs of
tfe grantor may maintaifi a bill in equity against him to enforce the resulting trust, and for partition of the land, and for complete relief between the parties.

THIS was a bill in. equity, filed May 24, 1889, against
William H. Grimshaw, and ag&ainst Mary J Brooks, an heir
ot Stup1ney Forrest, by the 6ther heirs of Forrest, and by

- Horace S. Cummings, trustee," to enforce a resultig trust
in, aad to obtain pzrtotion of, land in the citv of Washin-ton,
oonveyed
Foi.je t to David Redden an'i others. trustees
