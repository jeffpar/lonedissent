SMITH v. VULCAN IRON WORKS.
NORTON v. WHEATON.
PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE COUmRT OF Ai'PEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 200, 639. Argued January 19, 197. - Decided February 15, 1897.

Under the act of March 3, 1891, v 517, ยง 7, ansappeal to the Circuit Court
of Appeals from an interlocutory order or decree of the Circuit Court,
granting an m3unction and ordering an account, in a patent case, may
be from the whole order or decree; and upon such an appeal the Circuit
Court of Appeals may consider and decide the case on its merits, and
thereupon render or direct a final decree dismissing the bill.

INeach of these cases, the Circuit Court of the United States
for the Northern District of California, upon a bill in equity
for the infringement of a patent for an invention, an answer
denying the validity and the infringement of the patent, a
general replication and a hearing, entered an interlocutory
decree, adjudging that the patent was valid and had been infringe'd, granting an injunction, and referring the case to a
master to take an account of profits and damages. From
that decree, in each case, the defendant appealed to the I)ir
cit Court of Appeals.for the Ninth Circuit.
In the first case, the defendant, at the time of taking the
appeal, filed in the Circuit Court an assignment of errors, allegin" error in holding that the patent was valid, and that it
had been infringed. The plaintiff moved the Circuit Court
1of Appeals to dismiss the appeal, so far as it involved any
question except whether an injunction should be awarded.
But that court denied the motion, and, upon a hearing, examined the questions of validity and infringement, decided
them in favor of the defendant, and entered a decree reversing
the decree of the Circuit Court. 15 U. S. App. 217, 577. On
petition of the plaintiff, this court, on January 28, 18951, granted
a writ of eertzoioart to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
In the second case. the Circuit Court of Appeals .affirmed
the decree of the (irmit Court 29 U _S. App. 409 but, upon

Opinion of the Court.

a rehearing, decided that there had been no infringement,
reversed its own decree and that of the Circuit Court, and
remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the bill, and
afterwards denied a petition for a rehearing, and a motion to
certify questions of law to this court. 44 U. S. App. 118, 425.
The Circuit Court, upon receiving the nxandate of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, and without hearing the plaintiffs, entered
a final-decree dismissing the bill. An appeal from this decree
was taken by the plaintiff to the Circuit Court of Appeals,
and upon the defendant's motion, anti without any hearing
on the merits, was dismissed by that court. The plaintiff, on
November 9, 1896, presented to this court 0-petition for a
writ of xert orar&, and the court thereupon granted a rule to
show cause why the writ should not issue to bring up the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, "so that it may be determined whether, upon'an appeal from an interlocutory decree
granting a temporary injunction in a patent case, the Circuit
Court of Appeals can render or direct a final decree on the
merits."
That question was now, by leave of the court, orally argued
in both cases, the parties in the first case stipulating in writing that, if the decision of this court upon that question should
be in favor of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
the case should be dismissed by the appellees.

GitAY, after stating the case, delivered the opin-

ion of the court.
The act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, establishing Circuit Courts
of Appeals, after providing in section 5, for appeals from the
Circuit Courts and District Courts directly to this court in

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opimon of the Court.

certain classes of cases, and, in section 6, for appeals from
final decisions of those courts to the Circuit Court of Appeals
in all other cases, including cases arising under the patent
laws, further provides, in section 7, that " where, upon a
hearing in equity in a District Court, or in an existing Circuit
Court, an injunction shall be granted or continued by an
interlocutory order or decree, in a cause in which an appeal
from a final decree may be taken under the provisions of
this act to the Circuit Court of Appeals, an appeal may be
taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting or continuing such injunction to the Circuit Court of Appeals Provided, that the appeal must be taken within thirty days from
the entry of such order or decree, and it shall take precedence in the appellate court, and the proceedings in other
respects in the court below shall not be stayed, unless otherwise ordered by that court, during the pendency of such
appeal." 26 Stat. 828.
The questions presented by each of these cases are whether,
in a suit in equity for the infringement of a patent, an appeal
to the Circuit Court of Appeals from an interlocutory order
or decree of the Circuit Court, granting an injunction, and
referring the case to a master to take an account of damages
and profits, may be from the whole order or decree, or must
be restricted to that part of it %vhichgrants the injanction,
and whether the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon such an
appeal, may consider and decide the merits of the case,
and, if it decides them in the defendant's favor, may order
the bill to be dismissed.
Upon these questions there has been some diversity of
opinion among the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the different
circuits. But those courts have now generally-concurred in
taking the broader view of the appeal itself, and of the
power of the appellate pourt.
In the earliest of such appeals, th-i-cases were examined on
the merits, and, upon a reversal of the order or decree appealed from, the authority to- direct the bill to be dismissed
was assumed, Without question, in the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Dudley E. Jones Co. v Munger Co.

so as only to direct the injunction to be dissolved. Dudley E.

in the First Circuit, the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon such an appeal, to consider the merits of the

In the Fourth Circuit, the question does not appear to have
arisen in a patent case. But where, upon a bill in equity to
restrain a supervisor of registration from interfering with the
right to vote at the election of delegates to a convention to
revise the constitution of the State of South Carolina, the
Circuit Court of the United States for the District of South
Carolina had, by successive orders, granted and continued a
temporary injunction, the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon appeal from these orders, entered a decree, not only reversing
the orders, but directing the bill to be dismissed, the Chief
Justice saying, "Although the appeal is from interlocutory
orders, yet, as we entertain no doubt that such a bill cannot
'be maintained, we are constrained, in reversing these orders,
to remand the cause with a direction to dismiss the bill."
Green v. Atills (1895), 25 U S. App. 383, 398. An appeal
from that decree was dismissed by this court, without touch-Ing this question. 159 U S. 651.
In the Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, in a case in which
the Circuit Court had entered an interlocutory decre6 sustaining the validity of the patent, adjudging that there was an
infringement, ordering an account of damages and profits, and
granting an injunction, and had allowed an appeal from so
much only of that decree as granted the injunction, and denied
an appeal from the rest of the decree, the Circuit Court of
Appeals, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Jackson (then
Circuit Judge) with the concurrence of Judge Taft and Judge
Hammond, held that the appeal had been prQperly restricted
by the Circuit Court, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals
had no authority, upon this appeal, to hear and fully determine the. merits of the case, but that those remained, notwithstanding the appeal, within the jurisdiction and control of the
Circuit Court. That decision was made before the second decision in Richmond v. Atwood, 5 U. S. App. 151, above cited,

SMITH v. VULCAN IRON WORKS.
Opinion of the Court.

had been reported, and without reference to the practice of
courts of chancery elsewhere. And it was said in the opinion
"It would doubtless have been well if, in the creation of this
court, the seventh section of the act had permitted._or authorized an appeal from interlocutory decrees sustaining the validity of patents and adjudging their infringement, so as to
obviate in many cases the taking of expensive accounts, and
the delays incident thereto." Columbus Watch Co. v Jiobbmne
(October, 1892), 6 U. S. App. 275, 281. A certificate thereupon
made by the Circuit Court of Appeals, for the purpose of -obtaming the instructions of this court, was dismissed by this
court, with Mr. Justice Jackson's concurrence, because no
question of law was distinctly certified, and because the Circuit Court of Appeals had decided the case before granting
the certificate. 148 U S. 266.
That decision was long treated as settling the practice in
that circuit on appeals from such interlocutory decrees, and
as permitting the questions of validity and infringement to be
considered only so far as they affected the granting or refusal
of an injunction.

1892), 6 U S. App. 335, Columbus Watch Co. v Robbmn

Co. v B2ssell Co. (December, 1895, and February, 1896), 37
U S. App. 555, 689.
But, at last, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth
Circuit, in an able and elaborate opinion delivered by Judge
Lurton, with the concurrence of Judge Taft and Judge Hammond, being a majority of the court which had made the decision in Columbus Ifatch Co. v. Robblns, 6 U. S. App. 275,
above cited, expressly overruled that decision, and brought
the practice in that circuit into harmony with the practice
prevailing in other circuits. Btssell Go. v Goshen Co. (March,
1896), 43 U. S. App. 47, Dueber Co. v llobbins (May, 1896),

By the practice in equity, as administered in the Court of
Chancery and the House of Lords in England, and in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

Courts of Chancery and Courts of Errors in the States of
New York and New Jersey, appeals lay from interlocutory,
as well as from final, orders or decrees, and upon an appeal
from an interlocutory order or decree the appellate court had
the. power of examining the merits of the case,,and, upon
deciding them in favor of the defendant, of dismissing the
bill, and thus saving to both parties the needless expense of
a- further prosecution of the suit. Palmer H. L. Pract. 1,

But under the judicial system of the United States, from
the beginning until the passage of the act of 1891 establishing Circuit Courts of Appeals, appeals from the Circuit Courts
of the United' States in equity or in admiralty, like writs of
error.at common law, would lie only after final judgment or
decreel and an order or decree in a patent cause, whether
upon preliminary application or upon final hearing, granting
an injunction and referring the cause to a master for an account of.profits and damages, was interlocutory only, and not
final, and therefore not reviewable on appeal before the final
decree in thepause. Acts of September 24, 1789, c. 20, ยง 13,

The provision of section 7 of the act of 1891, that where
"upon a hearing in equity" in a Circuit Court "an injunction
shall be granted or continued by an interlocutory order or
decree," in a cause in which an appeal from a final decree
might be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, "an appeal
may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting or continuing such injunction" to that court, authorzes,

SMITH v. VULCAN IRON WORKSOpinion of the Court.

according to its grammatical construction and natural mean-

ing, an appeal to be taken from the whole of such interlocutory order or decree, and not from that part of it only which
grants or continues an injunction.
The manifest intent of this provision, read in the light of
the previous practice in the courts of the United States, contrasted with the practice in courts of equity of the highest
authority elsewhere, appears to this court to have been, not
only to permit the defendant to obtain immediate relief from
an injunction, the continuance of which throughout the progress of the cause might seriously affect his interests, but also
to save both parties from the expense of further litigation,
should the appellate court be of opinion that the plaintiff was
not entitled to an injunction because his bill had no equity to
support it.
The power of the appellate court over the cause, of which
it has--cquired jurisdiction by the appeal from the interlocutory decree, is not affected by the authority of the court appealed from, recognized in the last clause of the section, and
often exercised by other courts of chancery, to take further
proceedings in the cause, unless in its discretion it orders them
to be stayed, pending the appeal. Hovey v. MJcDonald, 109
U. S. 150, 160, 161, In v'e Rabernman Co., 147 U S. 525, ilfe88onnser v. KJauman, 3 Johns. Ch. 66.

In each of the cases now before the court, therefore, the
Circuit Court of Appeals, upon appeal from the interlocutory
decree of the Circuit Court, granting an injunction and ordering an account, had authority to consider and decide the case
upon its merits, and thereupon to render or direct a final decree dismissing the bill.
ITr the second case, it was argued, in upport of the petition
for D,writ of certoram, that the Circuit Court, upon recelving
the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals directing a dismissal of the bill, erred in entering a final decree accordingly,
without further hearing; and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in dismissing an appeal. from that decree. But
the rule to show cause did not proceed upon that ground.
And the merits of the case, having been once determined by'

the appellate court in reversing the interlocutory decree, were
not open to reconsideration at a later stage of the same case,
either in that court or in the court below Sanford. Fork &ยข
Tool Co., ,petitzoner, 160 U. S. 247, and cases there cited,
Great Western Tel. Co. v. Burnham, 162 U S. 339. Had the
case been heard anew in each gourt after the first mandate,
the only difference in the result would have been an affirmance, instead of a dismissal, upon the second appeal. That
difference, not affecting the essential rights of the parties, is
no ground upon which thii court should exercise its discretionary power of issuing a writ of certiorari.
It follows that, in the first case, in accordance with the
stipulation of the parties, the writ of certiorari heretofore
granted is dismissed, and, in the second case, the writ of certiorari is denied.

manufacture, sale, etc. of oleomargarine, required packages thereof to be
