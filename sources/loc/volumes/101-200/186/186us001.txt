Nos. 72, 73, 74, 75. Argued November 22,25,1901.-Decided May 19,1902.
The Styria, an Austrian steamship sailing from Trieste via Sicilian ports
to New York, took on board at Port Empedocle, Sicily, a quantity of sulphur for New York. Before sailing the master larned that war had
broken out between Spain and the United States, and as sulphur was an
article contraband of war, he had the sulphur all unloaded and warehoused at Port Empedocle before sailing. This court holds that the master of the Styria was justified in relanding and warehousing the contraband portion of the cargo, and that in so doing he had reasonable regard
for the interests of both ship and cargo.
This court does not think that, in the subsequent circumstances, it was the
master's duty to reship that cargo, and resume his voyage with the sulphur on board.

FouR libels in admiralty were filed in the District Court of
the United States forthe Southern District of New York against

to deliver at New York different lots of sulphur, owned by the
libellants, shipped on board the Styria at Port Eimpedocle, the
port of the town of Girgenti, in Sicily, April 21-2, 1898, and
shortly afterwards relanded at the port of shipment because -it.
had become contraband of war. The facts were substantially
undisputed, and were as follows:
The Styria was an Austrian steamship, owned by the AustroAmericana Steamship Company, and Burrill & Sons of Glasgow were her managing agents. She sailed April 16, 1898,
with some cargo, from Trieste via Sicilian ports for New York,
and on April 21 reached Port Empedocle, Sicily, her second
loading port. Her master began at once to load on board the
sulphur in question, and by April 21 it was all on board, bills
of lading therefor (containing.the provisions copied in the margin 1) had been signed, and the vessel cleared from the customhouse, and ready to proceed on her voyage to Messina and Palermo for a cargo of fruit, and thence to New York.
In the mean time, unknown to the master, war had broken
out between the United States and Spain. On April 20, Congress passed, and the President approved, the joint resolution
recognizing the freedom and independence of Cuba, and demanding that the government of Spain relinquish its authority
in the island and withdraw its land and naval forces. 30 Stat.

demanded and received his passports. On'April 21, the AmerITo be delivered at the port of N~ew York, "restraints of princes and

ordinary course of her voyage) to ship or transship the goods by any other

"IIn case of blockade or interdict of the port ofg discharge, or if, without

goods at any other port which he may consider safe, at shipper's risk and
expense, and on the goods being placed in charge of any mercantile agent
or of British consul, and a letter being put into the post-office, addressed
to the shipper and consignee, if named, stating the landing and with whom
deposited, the goods to be at the shipper's risk and expense, and the master
and owners discharged from all responsibility."

Statement of the Case.

ican minister at "Madridwas informed that the diplomatic relations between the two governments were broken off, and he
left that same day. On April 22, the first overt act of war,
the capture of the Spanish merchant steamship, the Buena
Ventura, -was committed. Die Buena Jentura,175 U. S. 384.
On April 25, Congress passed an act declaring that war had
existed since April 21. 30 Stat. 364, c. 189. On April 25, the
Queen Regent of Spain issued a decree announcing the existence of war with the United States; authorizing the Royal
Navy, "in order to capture the enemy's ships, to confiscate the
enemy's merchandise under their own flag, and contraband of
war under any flag," to exercise the right of search on the high
seas and in the territorial waters of the enemy ; including, under the denomination of contraband, "powder, sulphur, saltpetre, dynamite, and every kind of explosive;" and charging
the Minister of State and the Minister of Marine with the fulfiluent of this decree.
On April 23, the master of the Styria received a telegram
from Burrill & Sons, her managing agents, directing him not to
sail until further orders; and on April 25 another telegram directing him "to discharge whole cargo as quicldy as possible."
The master had by this time learned that war existed, and that
sulphur was contraband. He knew thlat his course would take
him within a few miles of the Spanish coast, in order to sight
the lighthouses; and he had seen in an Italian newspaper that
Spanish men-of-war were looking for contfiaband goods, and
that a sulphur ship had been taken. In obedience to the instructions from the managing agents, as well as because he saw
in the newspapers that the sulphur was contraband of war and
nae considered it unsafe to carry it, the master began to reland
the sulphur at Port Einpedocle on April 27, and hat it all unloaded and warehoused by May 7. At the beginning of the
unloading on April 27, he gave notice in writing to the shippers,
and to the consignees named in the bills of lading, that "on
finding risky my passage to New York with the actual sulphur
cargo, for facts of war," he was discharging the cargo for the
account and risk of the shippers, "under care of the mercantile agent, Mr. William Peirce, depositing the same in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

warehouses of Mr. Zenobia Urso here, and, if these are not
sufficient, in the warehouses of the British consulate, faculty
which I have in force in the bills of lading." On the same day,
he gave notice in writing to the Austrian consul at Girgenti
"that, by order of the representative of my owners, for facts
of war," he was discharging and warehousing the sulphur from
the Styria, for whom it might concern; and also gave notice
in writing, through the Austrian consul, to the director general
of the customs at Girgenti, that, having loaded the sulphur on
the Styria, "and sulphur being declared contraband of war,
war actually existing between Spain and the Unitedf States of
America, in behalf of the present laws, I deem it in the interest
of all whom it might concern to discharge the whole sulphur
here on receiving the necessary permit from the customs;"
and asking that duties might be remitted on reshipment. On
April 30 and May 2, the shippers of the sulphur protested
against the unloading; and on May 3 and 5, respectively, the
master replied that he, "in discharging the goods, acted as was
his right, and in the best interest of the goods, which is confirmed by the fact, published in the papers, and discussed in
the Italian Parliament, that sulphur had been declared contraband of war by one of the belligerent powers." And at the
conclusion of the unloading, on May 7, the master gave notice
to the shippers that, as soon as they paid the expense incurred
on their account, the sulphur would be delivered to them; and
to the consignees that the sulphur was lying in the warehouses
at Port Empedocle, at the risk and expense of whom it might
concern.
The exportation of sulphur is one of the principal industries
of the island of Sicily, and immediately after the declaration
of war Sicilian merchants urged the Italian Government to request Spain to exempt it from the list of contraband. The Giornale di Sicilia, a newspaper of Palermo, each issue of which
had a double date, and was read by the master of the Styria
on the day of its publication, contained, according to the translations in the record, the following information on the subject:
On April 24-25, 1898, it was stated that the merchants of Mlessina had requested their deputy in the Italian Parliament to

THE STYRIA, SCOPINICH, CLAIMANT, v. M1ORGAN.

Statement of the Case.

urge the Government to induce Spain to exclude sulphur from
being considered contraband of war; and that the deputy had
been assured that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would telegraph to the Italian Ambassador in Madrid to obtain what was
required from the Spanish authorities. On April 26-27, it was
stated that Spain included sulphur in the list of contraband of
war, and that the Italian Council of Ministers had decided to induce Spain to revoke its decision. On April 27-28, it was stated
that an Italian deputy had asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs
in Parliament whether sulphur had been excluded from the list
of contraband of war. On April 29-30, it was stated that the
Spanish Government had not yet pronounced itself upon the
Italian demand to exclude sulphur from the list of contraband'
of war; that the Italian Ambassador had been promised an
immediate decision ; that the Spanish Minister of Marine seemed
decidedly adverse to the demand; but that it was hoped it would
be conceded. The paper of May 1-2 contained, under date of
May 1, from an anonymous correspondent at Rome, these statements: "Although the official advice has not yet arrived, I
assure.you absolutely that the Spanish government has determined to exclude sulphur from the list of contraband of war.
The Popolo Romano, confirming my information, says that the
relative decree is imminent which has been provoked by the
insistence of our ambassador in Madrid, who obtained from
Sagasta that he should unite the Council of Ministers, in which,
notwithstanding the opposition of the Minister of Marine,-the
opinion prevailed to exclude sulphur from contraband." "The
Official Gazette will publish the decision regarding sulphur.
Meantime the Spanish Government has already ordered the
commanders of its ships tb allow sulphur to pass free." The
paper of May 3-4 contained, under date of May 3, from its Roman correspondent, this statement: "The Department of Foreign Affairs decided not to publish in the Official Gazette the
Spanish Government's decision regarding the exclusion of sulphur from contraband of war. But the Minister of the Interior
sent a circular to all the prefects in Sicily, informing them of
the orders relative to the free navigation of cargoes of sulphur."
The Giornale di Sicilia of May 5-6, 1898, contained, under

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

the heading "Sulphur is not War Contraband," the following:
"From the Minister of, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce,
the following telegram has been sent: IChamber of Com merce,
Palermo: I inform the Chamber of Commerce, for the useful
information of merchants, that by the decree of April 23d of
the Spanish Government are considered, as contraband of war,
arms, projectiles, fuses, powder, sulphur, nitre, dynamite, explosives, uniforms, brnaments, saddles, engines for ships, derricks,
screws, boilers, and all that is necessary for, the construction,
repair and armament of men of war. I would also state that,
in consequence of our request, the Spanish Government has
given notice to the commanders of its vessels to let sulphur pass
free. The Minister, Coeco Ortu.'"
The master also testified that on the evening of May 7 he
saw a notice from the Austrian consul, saying that there had
been a communication from the prefect that it was agreed between Spain and Italy that the Spanish ships had instructions
to let sulphu.r go free;. but "it was not given officially, only a
matter of verbal arrangement. Of course, the verbal arrangement you can't believe."
Early in the morning of May 8, the master sailed, without
the sulphur, to Palermo, and thence to Messina, took on board
at each place a cargo of fruit, and on June 3 arrived at New
York. Soon after the arrival there, these libels were filed.
The Giornale di Sicilia of May 7-8, 1898, (which did not
reach the master before he sailed from Port Empedocle,) contained, under the heading "The Exportation of Sulphur may be
continued," the following: "The Prefettura also with its communication confirms to us that the exportation of sulphur, notwithstanding the Spanish-American war, may continue. Indeed,
the Spanish Government has officially declared, in the circular
to the commandants of their ships, that sulphur is not to be
considered as contraband of war. An official and public declaration is lacking, but there is no doubt that sulphur -willpass
freely."
On May 10, 1898, the Foreign Office in London, answering a
telegram from Burrill & Sons, wrote them: "Spanish Government state that decree already issued cannot be altered, but that

as temporary measure Naval Departments have been ordered
not to treat sulphur as contraband of war. They lay stress on
the fact that the measure is temporary only."
It appeared from inquiries made by the Foreign Office in London, and by the American Embassy in Italy, in June and July,
1898, that the actual state of facts was as follows: The Spanish
Minister for Foreign Affairs verbally stated to the Italian Ambassador at Madrid, on April 29, 1898, and to the British Ambassador at Madrid, on.IMay 6, 1898, that, while the decree of
April 23 could not be altered, orders would be given to the
Naval Departments, as a temporary measure, not to treat sulphur
as contraband of 'war. On May 31, 1898, the Spanish Minister,
in a note to the British Ambassador at Madrid, stated that the
treatment of sulphur as contraband of war would be temporarily
suspended; that the orders which had been given to that effect
would not be revoked'without due notice i and that the eventual
revocation of the orders would not, in any case, apply to vessels
at sea in ignorance of it, while the necessary time would be
given for the execution of pending contracts. It did not appear that Spain ever made any public announcement of the
modification of her intentions in regard to the treatment of
sulphur, or ever agreed to let sulphur go free permanently.
A vessel which lay-alongside the Styria at Port Empedocle,
loading sulphur, sailed before she did, and arrived at New York,
in safety on May'19. Two other vessels laden. with,sulphur
came safely from the Sicilian port of Licata to the United
States about the same time. And no sulphur ships were taken
by Spain during the war.
Presently after the signing of the peace protocol between
the United States and Spain on 'August 12, 1898, the parties to
these cases stipulated in writing that the steamship company.
should forward the sulphur from Port Empedocle by the first
available vessel to New York, and deliver it to the consignees,
upon the terms and for the freight specified in thie original bills
of lading; that the sulphur, upon arrival, should be sold at current market rateg, and' the proceeds, less charges incurred, be
credited on account of the damages, if any, recovered by the
libellants; that, if the Styria was justified in relanding and

storing the sulphur as was done, the company should have a
lien upon the sulphur for the charges against it in Sicily; and
that, if it was not so justified, the sulphur should be free from
any charges except freight.
Under this stipulation, the steamship company paid the expenses of storage in Sicily, and reloaded the sulphur and brought
it to New York in its steamship Abazzia, sailing September 4,
and arriving September 30, and there delivered it to the con.signees, who paid the freight as agreed, and sold the sulphur at
the current market rates. And the company filed cross libels
for the charges in Sicily.
The District Court found for the libellants, holding that the
discharge bf the cargo was too hasty and precipitate, and not
justified by the facts of the case; and entered decrees for the
libellants in small amounts, and dismissed the cross libels. 93

Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which
held that the sulphur was rightly discharged, but should have
been reloaded before the Styria left Port Empedocle; and entered decrees for the libellants for increased damages, and upon
the cross libels for the expenses of unloading, warehousing and
reloading in Sicily. 101 Fed. Rep. 728.

Opinion of the Court.
M. JuSTICE SHIRAS,

after stating the case, delivered the opin-

ion of the court.
The master of a ship is the person who is entrusted with the
care and management of it, and the great trust reposed in him
by the owners, and the great authority which the law has vested
in him, require on his part and for his own sake, no less than
for the interest of his employers, the-utmost fidelity and attention. Abbott on Shipping, 7th Am. ed. 167.
It was well said by the District Judge in the present case,
that "though exceptions noted in the bill of lading contemplate
circumstances of war, and are therefore applicable in the extraordinary circumstances that arose, still the carrier is not thereby
relieved from the duty of acting with reasonable prudence for
the interests of all concerned. The master, as the agent of all
concerned, is still bound to a prudent regard for the interests of
the cargo, and must endeavor to hold the balance evenly between ship and cargo when their interests conflict."
"All will agree that the master must act in good faith and
exercise his best discretion for the benefit of all concerned."
Nfew PngZand Insuiance Company v. The Sa'ah Ann, 13 Pet.
400; The Amelia, 6 Wall. 27.
The good faith of the master and his reasonable exercise of
discretion must be considered and determined in the light of
the facts in each particular case. The term discretion implies
the absence of a hard-and-fast rule. The establishment of a
clearly defined rule of action would be the end of discretion,
and yet discretion should not be a word for arbitrary will or
inconsiderate action. "Discretion means a decision of-what is
just and proper in the circumstances." Bouvier's Law Dict.
"Discretion means the liberty or power 6f acting without other
control than one's own judgment." Webster's Dict.
Courts, in passing upon such questions, should endeavor to
put themselves- in the position of the actors in the transaction,
and not be ready to find that the course actually pursued was
blameworthy because the results were unfortunate; what those
concerned have a right to demand of a master, when confronted
with unexpected emergencies, is not an infallible but a deliber-

OOTOBER TERIE,

Opinion of the Court.

ate and considerate judgment. Mere good faith will not excuse
him, if his decision turns out to have been wrong, but the resalt is
-not always a true criterion whether a man pursued a prudent
course or not. Holliday v. Keiinard, 12 Wall. 254.
Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, we
have to inquire whether the conduct of the master of the Styria showed a reasonable exercise of judgment, having regard
to the rights of the owners of the vessel and those of the several
owners-of cargo.
That the situation was a difficult one is obvious, and is shown
by the fact that the learned judges of the courts below, though
having the advantage of a full disclosure of the facts and of
able discussion by counsel, disagreed on the critical question in
the case; whether the master was right in deciding that it was
his duty to reland and store the contraband goods.
A8 herefofore stated, the Styria was an Austrian steamship,
oWned by the Austro-Americana Steamship Company, and
Burrill & Sons of Glasgow were her managing agents. She
sailed April 16, 1898, with some cargo, from Trieste via Sicilian
ports for-New York, and on April 21 reached Port Empedocle,
Sicily, her second loading port. Her master began at once to
load on board different lots of sulphur owned by the libellants,
and by April 24 it was all on board, bills of lading therefor
had been signed, and the vessel cleared from the custom-house,
and -was ready to proceed on her voyage to Messina and Palermo for additional cargo of fruit, and thence to New York.
On April 27, the master, having learned that war between
Spain and the United States had broken out, and being aware
that sulphuf was a contraband article, began to reland the sul•phur at Port Empedocle, and had it all unloaded and warehoused by May -7. He gave notice in writing to the shippers,
and to the consignees named in the bills of lading, that, "on finding risky my passage to New York with the actual sulphur cargo
for facts of war," he was discharging that portion of his cargo.
On the same day he gave notice in writing to the Austrian'
consul at Girgenti "that, by order of the representative of my
owners, for facts of war," he was discharging and warehousing
the sulphur from the Styria, for whom it might concern; and

TaE STYRIA, SCOPINICH, CLAIMANT, v. MORGAN.

11

Opinion of the Court.

also gave notice in writing, through the Austrian consul, to
the director general of the customs at Girgenti, that, having
loaded the sulphur on the Styria, "and sulphur being declared
contraband of war, war actually existing between Spain and
the United States of America, in behalf of the present laws, I
deem it in the interest of all whom it might concern to discharge
the whole sulphur here on receiving the necessary permit from
the customs;" and asking that duties might be remitted on reshipment.. On April 30 and May 2 the shippers of the sulphur
protested against the unloading; and on May 3 and 5, respectively, the master replied that he, "in discharging the goods,
acted as was his right, and in the best interest of the goods-'
which is confirmed by the fact, published in the papers, and
discussed in the Italian Parliament, that sulphur had been declared contraband of war by one of the belligerent powers."
And at the conclusion of the unloading, on May 7,the master
gave notice to the shippers that, as soon as they paid the expense incurred on their account, the sulphur would be delivered
to them; and to the consignees that the sulphur was lying in
the warehouses at Port Empedocle, at the risk and expense of
whom it might concern.
As both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals
held that, within the provisions of the bills of lading, the master
had the right to decide on the course to pursue, whether to
discharge the sulphur, or to refuse to sail until there was somereasonable assurance of safety, or to immediately proceed on his
voyage, it is unnecessary for us to discuss the meaning of the
bills of lading in that regard, but only to determine whether
the decision of the master, to discharge and warehouse the
goods, was a reasonable exercise of the discretion vested in
him.
The learned judge of the District Court held that, while the
bills of lading contemplated circumstances of war and were
therefore applicable, yet that the master's right under them
could not be exercised without waiting a reasonable time to
see whether the danger of continuing the voyage with the sulphur might not be removed by negotiation between the Italian
and Spanish governments. He thus expressed himself (93 Fed.
Rep. 477) :

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

"The sulphur being generally regarded as contraband of war,
and also within the express terms of the Spanish proclamation,
a voyage through the Mediterranean, past the coast of Spain
and through the Straits of Gibraltar, would presumably be
peculiarly dangerous to the cargo, even though the vessel, as a
neutral, might not be liable to condemnation as prize. In case
of seizure, however, the shipowner would suffer from the considerable delay incident to the seizure, though she were ultimately released. Except, therefore, for the negotiations immediately entered on for procuring an exception of sulphur
from contiaband, I have no doubt that it would have been both
the right and the duty of the master, for the interests of the
cargo as well as of the ship, to refuse to sail with this cargo
after clearing on April 24, until there was some reasonable assurance of safety. See Tie San Boman., L. R. 3 Adm. & Ecol.
583, where there was a delay of three months. The discharge
and storage of the cargo, however, was an act necessarily involving considerable expense to the shipper or consignee; and
before imposing such an expense upon the cargo the master, in
my judgment, was bound in view of the daily reports of current
negotiations and the expectations of the exception of sulphur,
to wait a reasonable period for satisfactory assurances in that
regard.

.

.

.

I must find, therefore, that the ship was not

justified by clauses (a) and (b) of the bill of lading in discharging and storing, the cargo on account of the shippers, as she did,
between April 27th and May 7th; that by the 10th of May
there was reasonable assurance that it would be safe to go on
with the voyage, and that this was not an unreasonable time
for-the ship to wait under the facts and circumstances currently
known in Sicily at that time." 93 Fed. Rep. 474; 95 Fed.
Rep. 698.
The Circuit Court of Appeals took a different view of the
duty of the master to suspend his voyage and await the uncertain results of the rumored negotiations, and held that he had
a right to unload the cargo of sulphur when he did. The following quotations sufficiently show the reasoning of the court:
"It seems manifest that, upon the outbreak of war, a voyage
with contraband. on board to the.port of one of the belligerents

THE STYRIA, SCOPINICa, CLAIMANT, v. MORGAN. - 13
Opinion of the Court

might fairly be regarded as a risky piece of business. The suggestion made upon the argument that the naval power of Spain
was not such as would induce a man ' of ordinary courage, judgment and experience' to hesitate to proceed, is of no weight.
We may not attribute to the captain of the Styria knowledge
gained after the event.; and indeed this court is not advised of
any historical facts which would warrant the conclusion that it
was not entirely within the power of Spain, during the first few
months of the war, to arrest and search every vessel westward
bound through the Straits of Gibraltar, and picking her way

not find it necessary to discuss this branch of the case, because
we find in clause (a) abundant authority for a refusal to carry
fQrward the sulphur, While such a condition of affairs existed as
that already described as being generally known to exist, when
the discharge began on April 27. There is no logical difference
between a restraint of princes and rulers exercised by a cruiser,
with power to visit, search and seize, lying two leagues off Cape
Empedocle, and that exercised by a half dozen cruisers patrolling a narrow strait through which, if the voyage be made, the
vessel must pass. Under such circumstances the owner of contraband cargo, loaded as this was before war broke out, could
with reason insist that it would be gross negligence on the part
of the ship to bring his cargo forward. Moreover, it would
certainly be unreasonable to require the ship to remain in port
with the contraband cargo on board until the war should cease,
a period of months, possibly years. The owners of other cargo
not contraband have rights as much, if not more, entitled to
consideration than those of the owners who have been unfortunate enough to ship the cargo which has produced the

made in time of peace, could properly decline to carry forward
a cargo which by the subsequent breaking out of War had
become contraband, we fail to see why he should not have the
right to land such contraband cargo, with all proper precautions as to safekeeping, thus leaving his ship free to discharge
its obligations to innocent cargo without risk or delay by reason
of an actual arrest, which would be caused only by thepresence

Opinion of the Court.

of such contraband cargo. The ship made no contract to carry
contraband of war to the port of a belligerent, and should not
be held to the obligations of a contract into which she has never
entered. We understand that the District Court reached this
same conclusion, but found the ship in fault because she did
not wait a reasonable period to see if there might not be some
,reasonable assurance of .safety, and held that' the commencement of the discharge on the 27th was too hasty and precipitate.' This brings us to the next branch of the cage.
"When two nations formally proclaim the existence of a state
of war between themselves with all the solemnity observed in
this instance, it would seem to be going too far to say that parties whose 6ontracts are affected thereby should wait some indefinite time, which a court shall find reasonable, in a vague
expectation that the belligerents may think better of it and make
peace. A situation is quite conceivable, where delay might
fairly be required. Thus the minister of one power or the other
might demand his passports; or the day named in an ultimatum
might pass without compliance with its requirements; or a
squadron of the war vessels of one power might impress seamen
from the deck of the war vessel of another power, as the Carnatic and her consorts did with the Baltimore in 1798; or the
war vessel of one power encountering the war vessel of another
upon the high seas might pour broadside after broadside into
her, as.the Leopard did with the Chesapeake in 1807-any one
of which acts would seem to import the imminence if not the
actual existence of war, and yet might fall short of being such
authoritative evidence of a state of belligerency as would justify
a master in treating any part of his cargo as being thereby made
contraband. But the situation shown here was a very different
one. Both nations had united in proclaiming to the whole world
that they were at war, and we know of no reason why the master of any vessel of a neutral nation was bound to wait twentyfour hours, or twenty-four days or twenty-four weeks, to see if
the two belligerents would not settle their differences.
"As soon as he learned that war was declared the master knew
that the cargo he had taken on board at Port Empedocle was
contrabrand. 'I kneii,' says he, 'that'sulphur is to make gun-

.

I thought it must

be contraband.' We should have some doubts as to the efficiency of a master for international commerce who did not know
that sulphur was contraband of war. It certainly should bo a
safe assumption for the master of a neutral vessel to make that
he cannot carry such cargo to the ports of one belligerent without risking its seizure by the other. And, in the absence of
special circumstances, there would seem to be no necessity to
wait for further assurance in that regard. In the case at bar,
however, there were special circumstances which will be next
considered.
"The exportation of sulphur is one of the greatest industries
of the.island of Sicily, and the Italian government was naturally
solicitous that the trade in sulphur with the United States should
not be interfered with. It now appears in the record, by reports
obtained from diplomatic sources, that shortly after the proclamation of the Queen Regent negotiations were opened by the
Italian government to secure a modification of its provisions so
that sulphur should ndt be considered contraband of war. The
Spanish government declined to alter the decree, but on April 29,
at Madrid, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs ' Verbally'
[sic : orally ?] stated to the Italian Ambassador that orders
would be given to the iNaval Departnments, as a temporary measure, not to treat sulphur as contraband of war. The same statement was made by the Spanish M inister for Foreign Affairs to
the British Ambassador on May 6. On May 31 the same Miinister stated in an official note to both the Italian and the British
Ambassadors that the treatment by Spain of sulphur as contraband of war would be temporarily suspended, and that the order
which had been given to that effect would not be revoked without due notice.
"Not being in telephonic communication: with the chancellery of the embassy at Madrid, the master of the Styria was
not advised of these transactions at the moment they occurred.
And his c6nduct is to be judged not in the light of exact knowledge acquired after the event but by such information as may
have been available for him at the time and place. Aswehave
seen, he knew certainly on April 27, and probably on April 26,

that war had been declared, and that his sulphur cargo was contraband; that he was, therefore, entitled to land and store it,
thus leaving his ship free to carry out her obligations to the
rest of the cargo. On April 25 the Giornale di Sicilia, a newspaper published at Palermo, and which the captain saw from
day to day, gtated that Messina merchants had asked their Parliamentary deputy to urge the government to codperate to exclude brimstone from being considered contraband. From day
to day thereafter the paper was fied with reports and rumors
as to the progress of this movement to secure exemption. But
down to-the 6th of May not one. of these reports bore the stamp
of authority; no one vouched for their accuracy. The statements in the clippings from the newspaper which have been
printed in the record are merely the expression of the beliefs
and expectations of its correspondents in Rome, or elsewhere
furnishing copy to a paper published in a community where an
intense interest was felt in having sulphur exempted. There
was no reason why it -should be exempted; it is a variety of
merchandise such as always has been contraband; its' exportation to the United States might well be considered an 'aid' to
Spain's enemy; no one appears to have suggested that the United States concede the same exemption. ' On the one hand it
might be urged that it would please the government and people of, Italy to grant the request, but on the other hand, in the
case of merchandise so highly contraband, neither the Italian
government nor people could justly take offence, if Spain
should insitt on exercising the rights which international law
accords to every belligerent. Enlightened by the information
now made known, we can see that the hopeful prognostications
of the writers for the Journal of Sicily were well founded; but
there was nothing to give any such assurance at the time they
appeared. We should hesitate to hold that it was the duty of
a master under similar circumstances to delay action on the expectation that a belligerent would voluntarily abandon one of
its weapons, on no better assurance that such actionwould be
taken than the statements of anonymous and irresponsible contributors to a newspaper published in a community which is
extremely solicitous that such action be taken." - 101 Fed. Rep.

THE STYRIA, SCOPINICH, CLAIMANT, v. MORGAN. 17
Opinion of the Court.

We concur in these views of th; Circuit Court of Appeals and
in the conclusion thereby reached, that the master of the Styria
was justified in relanding and warehousing the contraband portion of his cargo, and that in so doing he had reasonable regard
for the interests of both ship and cargo.
Several leading authorities are cited on this branch of the
case in the brief for the Styria, and which we shall briefly notice.
Geipel v. Smith, L. IR. 7 Q. B. 404, was a case where the defendants had agreed to load a cargo of coal in England and sail
to Hamburg. After the charter party had been made war broke
out between France and Germany, and the port of Hamburg
was blockaded by the French fleet. The defendants refused to
carry out the charter party, relying on an exception of restraints
of princes and rulers. It was held that they were justified in
their refusal. And as to the contention that the defendants
were bound to be in readiness to carry the cargo as soon as
the blockade should be raised, Cockburn, C. J., observed:
"But it would be monstrous to say that in such case the parties must wait, for the obligation must be mutual, till the restraint
be taken off-the shipper with cargo which might be perishable
or its market value destroyed-the shipowner with his ship lying
idle, possibly rotting;" and Lush, J., said: "A state of war
must be presumed to be likely to continue so long and so to disturb the commerce of merchants as to defeat and destroy the
object of commercial adventure like this."
In NSobel's Explosives Co. v. Jenkins,L. R. 1896,2 Q. B. 326, the
plaintiff's goods, which were dynamite and contraband of war,
had been placed upon a general ship of the defendant for carriage
from London to Yokohama, a bill of lading containing similar
clauses with'those in the case of the Styria. The ship also contained non-contraband goods belonging to other shippers. In the
course of the voyage, she arrived at Hong Kong, and while there
war was declared between China and Japan. There were at
the time Chinese war vessels in and around the port of Hong
Kong, and it was found that -if the master had atteinpted to
sail thence with the plaintiff's goods on board there would have
been danger of their being seized and confiscated. The master

cabled to his owners for advice, and they instructed him to land
the cargo at Hong Kong. -This was done. The plaintiffs forwarded the dynamite by another steamer several months later,
and then brought an action to recover from the defendants the
amount of freight which they had to pay for so forwarding, and
also for the other expenses for relanding and reshipping the
cargo at Hong Kong. The opinion of the court, delivered by'
Mvatthew, J., is so pertinent to our case that we extract a considerable portion of it:
"The main ground of defence was the exception in the bill of
lading of ' restraint of princes, rulers or pople.' A large body
of evidence was laid before me to show that if the vessel sailed
with the goods on board she would, in all probability, be stopped
and searched. It was certain in that case that the goods would
have been. confiscated, and quite uncertain what course the
captQrs would take with the ship and the rest of the cargo: I
am satisfied that if the master had continued the voyage with
the goods on board he -would have been acting recklessly. It
was argued for the plaintiffs that. the clause did not apply unless there was a direct and specific action upon the goods.by
sovereign authority. It was said that the fear of seizure, however well founded, was not a restraint, and that something in
the nature of a seizure was necessary. But this argument is
disposed of by the cases of Geipel v. Smith, L. R. 7 Q. B. 404,
and Rodoconachi v. Elliott, L. R. 9 0. P. 518. The goods were
as effectually stopped at Hong Kong as if there had been an
express order from the Chinese government that contraband of
war should be landed. Th. analogy of a restraint by a blockade
or embargo seems to me sufficiently close. The warships of
the Chinese government were in such a position as to render
the sailing of the steamer with contraband of war on board a
matter of great danger, though she might have got away safely.
The restraint was not temporary, as was contended by the plaintiffs' counsel. There was no reason to expect that the obstacle
in the way of the vessel could be removed in any reasonable
time. I find that the captain in refusing to carry the goods
farther acted' reasonah)ly and prudently, and that the delivery
of the goods at Yokohama was prevented by restraint of princes
and rulers within the meaning of thd exception, ..

THE STYRIA, SCOPINIOH, CLAIMANT, v. MORGAN.

Opinion of the Court.

"Butf apart from the terms of the bill of lading, it seems to
me that the conduct of the captain would be justified by reference to the duty imposed upon, him to take reasonable care of
the goods entrusted to him. Whether he has discharged that
duty must depend on the circumstances of each case, and here,
if the goods had been carried forward, there-was every reason
to believe that the ship would be detained and the goods of the
plaintiffs confiscated. In the words of Willes, J., in 2Notarac
v. Henderson, L. R. 7-Q. B. 225, at p. 234, ' a fair allowance
ought to be made for the difficulty in which the master may be
involved.

.

. The place, the season-the opportunity and

means at hand, the interests of other persons concerned in the
adventure and whom it might be unfair to delay for the sake
of the part of the cargo in peril; in short, all circumstances affecting risk, trouble, delay and inconvenience must be taken into
account. I am of opinion that the course taken by the captain
in landing the goods and landing them in safe custody was a
proper discharge of his duty. It was said that the master was
not an agent for the shippers, because they had protested against
the discharge of the goods. But even if this information had
reached the captain, it would not have divested him of his
original authority and discretion as agent in any emergency for
the owners of the ship and the other owners of the cargo."
A suggestion of the District Judge, and repeated in the argument for the libellants, to the effect that the master was guided
in his action in discharging the contraband cargo by a telegram
from Burrill & Sons, the managing agents in London, rather
than by his own judgment on all the circumstances known to
him at the time; that if he had been left to exercise his own
judgment, he would not have discharged the cargo, especially
not at the time he did, dhes not appear to us to be supported by
the testimony of the captain, which is the only evidence on the
subject. Itis true that he did state that he acted under instructions of the agents, but he also said, in reply to questions put
on cross-examination, as follows:
" Now, Captain, you say that you put this brimstone ashore
on instructions of the managing owners? Answer. Yes, and
also because I knew that the war was there, and I acted on the

Opinion of the Court.

bill of lading clause. Question. You have testified, haven't
you, that all this you did by orders? Answer. No. The principal reason was because I was ordered; and, secondly, that I
had the bill of lading clause that fully authorized me when I
deemed it not safe to proceed with the cargo that was declared
contraband of war."
Without transcribing all of the master's testimony, but having read and weighed it, we are of opinion that it clearly shows
that, while he carried out the instructions of the agents, his
judgment, on the facts confronting him, was that it was not
safe for him to proceed with a contraband cargo, nor proper to
await indefinitely for the uncertain results pending negotiations
between Italy and Spain. Hlis conduct, as we have already
said, had due regard to the interests of all concerned in the ship
and in the cargo, both that which -was contraband and that
which was not so. So far as the shipowners were concerned,
he had the approval of 'the mamaging agents; so far as the
shippers and consignees were concerned, he acted upon his own
jjudgment, exercised, apparently in good faith, on their behalf.
In the cage of Nobe'8 Explosivem Co. v. Jenkins, just cited, the
same facts app}earea, namely, that the master consulted the
owners of the ship before he acted, but also acted in reference
to the duty imposed upon him to take reasonable care of the
goods entrusted to him. The master, in either case, would have
acted imprudently if he had not. secured the approval of the
shipowners, if it were possible to get it before the emergency
was over; and all that can be said is, that there was a concurrence of judgment between the ship agents and the master as
to what was the proper course to pursue.
But, while we concur with the-conclusion of the Circuit Court
of Appeals, that the-master acted discreetly.in landing and storing the contraband portion of the cargo when and as he did,
we cannot accept the other conclusion of that court that, in the
subseqnent- circumstances, it was the master's duty to reship
the cargo and resume his voyage with the sulphur on board.
Indeed, the facts and reasoning which brought the court to its
first, seem to us to be quite inconsistent with its latter conclusion. In its opinion, heretofore quoted, the court said that it

Opinion of the Court.

was not the duty of the master "to delay action on the expectation that a belligerent would voluntarily abandon one of its
weapons on no better assurance that such action would be taken,
than the statements of anonymous and irresponsible contributors
to a newspaper published in a community which is extremely
solicitous that action be taken." Yet the court thought that,
on May 6, the situation had changed, and that the publication
in a newspaper, purporting to be from the Italian Minister of
Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, that the Spanish Government had given notice to the commanders of its vessels to let
sulphur pass free, was an official declaration, upon the strength
of which the master ought to have reshipped the sulphur. That
publication, under the date of May 5 and 6, was as follows:
"Chamber of Commerce, Palermo: I inform the Chamber of
Commerce, for the useful information of merchants, that by the
decree of April 23 of the Spanish Government, are considered
as contraband of war, arms, projectiles, fuses, powder, sulphur.
I would also state that, in consequence of our request,

the Spanish Government has given notice to the commanders of
its vessels to let sulphur go free."
The publication of May 7 and 8 was as follows: "The prefettura, also, with its communication confirms to us that the
exportation of sulphur, notwithstanding the Spanish-American
war, may continue. Indeed, the Spanish Government has officially declared in the circular to the commandants of their
ships, that sulphur is not to be considered as contraband of war.
An official and public declaration is lacking, but there is no
doubt that sulphur will pass freely."
It must be observed that these assurances did not come from
any Spanish, but from Italian sources. It was for the interest
of the Italians to continue to export sulphur, and to give the
impression that it could be done with security to the carrying
must be weighed
vessels, and all statements from Italian sources
with reference to that fact. In the meantime, on May 7,the
Styria had sailed, and the master testified that when he was
clearing the ship to leave on the 7th of May he saw a notice
from the consul to say that there was a communication from
the prefect that it was agreed between Italy and Spain that

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

sulphur would not be taken, that Spanish vessels had instructions to let it go free, saying: "It was not given officiallyonly a matter of verbal arrangement. Of course, the verbal
arrangement you cannot believe." "On the 7th, in the evening," about eight o'clock, and I already had my clearances."
And he further testified, in reply to a question by libellant's
counsel, as follows: "Question. But the day before you sailed,
on the 7th, you did read in the papers that the Governments
had come to an agreement-to an understanding? Answer. Yes
-not to an understanding, not to a safe .,understanding, but a
temporary understanding, you know. Question. To the effect
that sulphur temporarily would not be treated as contraband
of. war? - Answer. Yes. Question. In spite of the previous
proclamation, was it not? Answer. Yes, but the papers said,
not officially confirmed, you see. That meant, of course, they
could withdraw it at any moment. Question. The newpapers
in which you read about these things, were what papers? Answer. I could not tell you. I believe the Sicilian Courier; I
don't know; something like that; the paper published in Palermo-the largest paper published in Palermo."
From this it appears that wben the Styria sailed on the evening of May I, the only information that the captain had was
that the newspapers said that a temporary verbal arrangement
had been made between Italy and Spain that sulphur might go
free, but that the captain's opinion was that a mere verbal arrangement could not be relied on, and that the statements contained in the newspapers could be withdrawn at any moment.
Giving to the evidence every reasonable intendment, it falls
far short, in our opinion, of making it the master's duty to
change his.arrangements to sail on the evening of the 7th of
'May. The Spanish proclamation of April 23, declaring sulphur
-to be contraband, had not been withdrawn, and it is evident
that the master had no right, in. justice to the other cargo owners, to make a longer delay. A perishable cargo of fruit was
awaiting the vessel at Palermo, and go one could foretell what
the result of the negotiations would be. The master and the
ship cannot reasonably be .charged with knowledge of subsequent events. And-when they are examined they do not show

THE STYRIA, SCOPINICH, CLAIMANT, v. MORGAN. 23:
Opinion of the Court.

that, within a reasonable period, any change in affairs was disclosed that would have made it safe beyond question to have
sailed with the contraband cargo on board. It was not until
May 10 that the British Government, replying to Burrill & Sons'
previous application for information, telegraphed that orders
had been given not to treat sulphur for the preseht as contra-,
band of war. And by telegram of that date it was further
stated that the Spanish Government states that "decree already
issued cannot be altered," but that, as "temporary measure,"
naval departments have been ordered not to treat sulphur as
contraband of iirar, "but they lay stress on the fact that the
measure is temporary only."
Moreover, it does not appear when such orders were actually
given, nor that they had been transmitted to war vessels which
had sailed, under the directions of the proclamation of April 23,
before such alleged orders were given. It was not until May 31
that the Spanish Minister stated, in a note to the English Ambassador at Madrid, that the treatment by Spain of sulphur 'as
contraband of war would be temporarily suspended, and that
the order which had been given to that effect would not be revoked without due notice. It does not appear that any formal
agreement was ever made between Spain and Italy, or any
other Government, that the proclamation of April 23, declaring
sulphur contraband of war, was withdrawn. And it is mere
matter of conjecture whether, if the Styria had sailed, even as
late as May 10, with sulphur on board, and had been arrested
by a Spanish war vessel which had not received orders countermanding the proclamation, that the sulphur would not have
been confiscated by a Spanish prize court. In any event, there
was the liability of such an arrest and of the incident delay to
both vessel and cargo.
Without protracting the discussion, we are of -the opinion
that the master was justified in landing and storing the cargo
that had become contraband by reason of the outbreak of the
war between Spain and the United States, and by the Spanish
proclamation of April 23; that, having acted reasonably with
due regard to the interest of all concerned in so doing, it was
not made his duty, by the facts brought to his notice, to reship
the sulphur on the Styria and further delay his voyage.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

The sulphur was subsequently, in pursuance of an agreement
in -writing, after the signing of the peace protocol between the
United States and Spain, forwarded on the steamship Abazzia,
belonging to the owners of the Styria, to the port of New York.
Several questions arose in the courts below, under the terms of
that agreement, and chiefly having reference to the measure of
damages in case that the vessel was held liable. But as, for the
reasons given, we hold that the vessel was not liable, those
questions do not call for our consideration.
The decrees of the District Court and of the Circuit Court of
Appeals, sustaining the libels of the respective libellants,are

the respective cross libels, are hereby q nirmed, and the causes
