INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v. CHICAGO, BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD
COMPANY.
APPEAL FRO3f THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 154. Argued November 7, 8, 1901.-Decided June 2, 1902.
This record requires the court to determine whether the court below rightly
refused to enforce an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission by
which it was found that an alleged terminal charge, made by the defendants in error, for the delivery of live stock to the stock yards in Chicago,
was unjust and unreasonable, and hence a violation of the act to regulate commerce.
As the right of the defendant carriers to divide their rates was conceded by
the Commission, and upheld, no contention on this subject arises.
The through rate existing prior to June 1, 1894, is presumed to have provided compensation for services in making delivery at the stock yards.
The proposed conclusion that the rates were unjust and unreasonable cannot be sustained.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right and must be affirmed;
but nothing therein is to be construed as preventing that body from commencing proceedings to correct unreasonableness in the rates as to territory to which the reduction did not apply.

of live stock to the stock yards in Chicago, was unjust and un-

Opinion of the Court.

reasonable, and hence violative of the act to regulate commerce.
To avoid the confusion which must be engendered by considering a number of irrelevant issues and to reach-the single question to which the controversy is reducible, it is essential to state
the facts, which are uncontroverted, concerning the making of
the charge in question, and to bear in mind the results of a controversy relating to such exaction, which arose when it was first
imposed by the railroad companies.
Prior to 1865 there were four different places in the city of
Chicago at which live stock shipped to that city was delivered
and marketed. The railroads by which such live stock was
brought into Chicago were accustomed to deliver at any one
of these four points as directed by the shipper, and no distinct'
terminal charge was made, the charge, if any, for the terminal
services being embraced in the through rate exacted for carriage from the point of shipment to the place of delivery. In
1865 a corporation was formed, called the Union Stock Yards
and Transit Company, which will be hereafter referred to as
the Stock Yards Company. Under its charter this corporation
was given the right to construct the necessary buildings and
conveniences for the receipt, keeping and marketing of live stock.
The corporation was given power to construct tracks connecting its facilities with the different lines of railway entering Chicago, and it was provided that when such tracks were constructed the Stock Yards Company might engage in the business
of transporting stock and other freight over these tracks on its
own account, or it might lease the privilege to do so upon such
terms as might be deemed best. The facilities and the tracks
were constructed, and it consequently came to pass that the
general market for live stock in Chicago was transferred from
the places at which such business had been previously carried
on to the establishment Qf the Stock Yards Company. Leaving aside all question of charges on freight, other than live stock,
from the incipiency of the opening of the stock yards in 1865
down to June, 1894, the railroads bringing in live stock to' Chicago were accustomed to use the tracks of the Stock Yards
Company for the purpose of delivering carloads of cattle, and
for the use of these tracks by the various comp4nies, for the
VOL. CLXxxvi-21

Opinion of the Court.

purpose above stated, no charge for trackage or otherwise was
made against the railroads by the Stock Yards Company, except a small sum for the unloading of the cattle. During these
thirty years the railroads did not divide their rates by separately charging for carriage from the point of shipment to Chicago and for terminal services rendered at Chicago, but asked
one rate from the place of shipment to delivery at the stock
yards.
In June, 1894, the Stock Yards Company imposed a trackage
charge for carrying in carloads of cattle to the stock yards and in
bringing the empty cars out. The railroads, therefore, became
subject to an additional burden, the amount of which depended
upon the distance which each road was obliged to carry its carloads of stock in going in and coming out over the tracks belonging to the Stook Yards Company. The situation of the various
roads was such that no one of them in consequence of this new
exaction paid less than 80 cents per car, that is, 40 cents each
way and none paid more than $1.50, that is, 75 cents each way.
The railroad officials thereupon entered into an agreement that
each road would impose a terminal charge of $2 upon each car
of cattle taken into the stock yards. A joint circular was issued
on behalf of the railroads, informing shippers on the subject,
the circular being as follows:
"On and after June the 1st, 1894, a terminal charge of $2
per car will be made in addition to the Chicago rates as shown
in the tariffs of the Western Freight Association on live stock
and other freight received from or delivered to the stock yards
or industries located on the tracks of the Union Stock Yards
Railway, the Indiana Line Railway and the Northern Indiana
Railroad."
The provisions of this circular were besides separately reiterated by the various railroads concerned in the agreement, and
in their posted tariffs, as in those filed with the Interstate Cornmerce Commission, a memorandum was made showing the additional charge substantially in the form above stated. In other
words, because the Stock- Yards Company imposed on the railroads a charge for the use of its tracks, varying between a minimum of 80 cents per car of cattle to a maximum of $1.50&per

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 323
Opinion of the Court.

car, the railroads immediately exacted a terminal charge on each
car of $2.
One of the roads which imposed this terminal charge was the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa F6. It was in the hands of a receiver appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of Illinois. Keenan, a shipper, who carried on his business at the stock yards, refused to pay the added
charge, and the receiver consequently declined to deliver to him
a consignment of cattle. Keenan thereupon petitioned the court
to instruct its receiver to make delivery of the cattle without
the payment of the charge in question. Several persons interested in the receipt of cattle at the stock yards intervened, and
prayed the court to make an order forbidding the receiver from'
exacting the additional $2. 'The Circuit Court granted the relief prayed for. it held that it had -been settled in Covington
Stock Yards Co. v. Keith, 139 U. S. 128, that a carrier could
not lawvfully divide his charge so as to separate the sum to be
paid for terminal services from that exacted for the through carriage, unless the terminal services embraced some character of
service not by operation of law included in the contract of carriage. 64 Fed. Rep. 992.
The case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where
the decree of the Circuit Court was reversed. That court
thought that the Circuit Court had misapplied the case of
Covington Stock Yards Co. v. Zeith, and, interpreting that
case, held that it was not authority for the proposition that a
carrier in a case like the one before the court could not divide
its rate so as to separate the terminal charge from that for carriage from the point of shipment to the place of delivery. '73
Fed. Rep. 753, 760. The court held that it was disclosed by
the record that Keenan was engaged in business at the stock
yards, that the cattle shipped to him were intended for delivery there, and hence the contract contemplated such delivery
beyond the rails of the final carrier; that it was therefore immaterial whether such carrier had facilities of its own for delivering cattle at any other place than the stock yards, because
even if such other facilities had existed they would not have
been used under the contract, since it contemplated that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

cattle were to be delivered at the stock yards and at no other
place.
The court concluded its opinion as follows:
"It is not suggested, assuming any such charge as is here in
question to be legal at all, that the amount is unreasonable.
The contention that the carriers must move cattle from their
lines of road over the track of the Stock Yards Company to
the stock yards, without compensation other than as contained
in their charges for hauling to points on their respective lines
in Chicago (and this is what the claim of these appellees
amounts to), is invalid."
Some months after the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals the Cattle Raisers' Association of Texas, an organization
composed of owners and raisers of cattle in Kansas, Montana,
North and South Dakota, Texas and the Indian Territory, filed
a petition before the Interstate Commerce Commission against
the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company and its
receiver, and various other railroad companies, and against the
Stock Yards Company. The petition in substance complained
that the terminal charge of $2 per each car of stock carried to
the stock yards was unjust and unreasonable, was a discrimination against Chicago and in favor of other points to which
cattle were shipped from the same territory, because at such
other points no such terminal charge was exacted. In view of
the method of charging adopted by the Stock Yards Company
as to dead freight passing over its lines from the lines of many
railroads entering Chicago the terminal charge above referred
to was, moreover, alleged to be a discrimination against live
stock as a species of traffic and in favor of dead freight. Subsequently the Chicago Live Stock Exchange, an association of
commission men and raisers and owners of cattle, intervened,
and attacked the terminal rate on substantially the grounds set
out in the petition just referred to. The defendant railways
answered. It suffices to say that the answers asserted that the
terminal rate complained of was just and reasonable, and the
discrimination alleged was denied. It was averred that for
years previous to the imposing of the terminal rate complained
of the carriers, under their contracts to carry and deliver cattle

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 325
Opinion of the Court.

in Chicago, had delivered such cattle to the stock yards without making any charge therefor, as in effect the rate asked for
the carriage and delivery to Chicago of cattle did not include
any terminal charge whatever, and such service was hence rendered gratuitously; that owing to the imposition in 1894 by the
Stock Yards Company of the charge for trackage the carriers
had exacted the $2 per car, which was only a just and reasonable equivalent for the cost incurred and service rendered in
delivering the cattle to the stock yards. It was further alleged
that at the time the terminal charge was imposed the rate to
Chicago for cattle from the various points referred to in the
complaint Was unreasonably low and the addition of the terminal charge complained of was, in any event, but a just and
reasonable addition to the thrmough rate. It was, besides, alleged
that such increase had not only been notified to the public by
the circular issued in the name of the various railroads previously referred to, but had also been included in the rate
sheets of the various railroads filed with the Interstate Conmerce Commission in accordance with law. The Atchison,
Topeka and Santa F6 Railroad, moreover, pleaded the decree
rendered in the Kelzan case, and averred in effect that such
decree conclusively established the right to make the terminal
charge in question. The various defendants, moreover, moved
to dismiss the Chicago Live Stock Exchange from the proceedings for reasons not necessary to be stated.
After hearing the Commission filed its report. The motion
to dismiss the intervention o'f the Chicago Live Stock Exchange
was denied. The Stock Yards Company was dismissed from
the cause on the ground that it was not a common carrier subject to the act to regulate commerce. The facts as found by
the Commission concerning the terminal charge have been in
substance given in the previous statement, and omitting for the
moment reference to a finding of the Commission as to a reduction made by the carriers in the through rate after the terminal
chargein controversy had been imposed, the conclusions reached
by the Commission are embodied in the following summary:
First. Although the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in the Zeenan case was held not to constitute res adjudicata

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

because of a want of identity of the parties concerned in the
Eeenan case and those involved in the case before it, the Commission, nevertheless, declared that it was its duty to follow
and apply to the case before it the legal principles announced
in the Keenan case. The Commission, therefore, announced
that it recognized that each and all of the defendant carriers
were entitled to divide their rates by making one separate and
,distinct charge for the carriage from the point of shipment to
Chicago, and another separate and distinct charge for. terminal
services in Chicago beyond their own lines. This principle,
however, the Commission found not to be decisive of the case
before it, since, even although the right to divide the rate was
fully recognized, the question remained whether the defendant
carriers had in fact divided their rates and whether the charge
complained of was just and reasonable.
Second. Coming to consider the two questions just stated,
the Commission held that the action of the carriers in giving
notice to the public of the imposition of the $2 terminal charge
and the filing of the rate sheets with the Commission as required by law, did not constitute a division of the rates so as to
separate the charge -for carriage to Chicago from the charge
for terminal services at that point, but amounted simply to a
retention of the aggregated through rate existing before the $2
terminal charge was asked, and the adding of this $2 charge to
the previous rate. It was found as a matter of fact that there
was no evidence tending t6 show that the previous through
rate was either unreasonably high or unreasonably low, and
therefore the presumption was that the through, rate prevailing
prior to the imposition of the $2 charge was just and reasonable.
Third. Considering the ,cost of delivery to the stock yards
over the'rails of the Stock Yards Company, including the sum
paid for trackage and-all other expenses, the Commission found
as a matter of fact that $2 per car would be just and reasonable. A reference to this subject, found in the report of the
Commission, is excerpted in the margin.' To remove all possi-,

Opinion df the Court.

ble doubt as to the fact the Commission, in its opinion, on a rehearing, to which opinion we shall hereafter advert, said:
"The defendants were proceeding to show by testimony in
each case that the actual cost to them of transporting these
carloads of live stock, including the trackage charge and the
cost of unloading, was equal to or in excess of $2. Thereupon
it was -suggested by the Commission, admitted by the intervenor, and at first partly admitted by the complainant, that
the cost of service, including the trackage chaige and the cost
of unloading, was sufficient to justify the imposition of this
terminal charge, provided, under the cireumstxnces of the eame,
it could properly be imposed. We understand that the defendants are given the full benefit of this in the report and opinion
already filed. To remove all doubt upon that subject, however, if it is not clearly found, we now find that, looking entirely to the cost of service, and including as a part of that
cost the trackage charge paid the Union Stock Yards and
Transit Company and the unloading charge paid that same
company, the amount of this terminal, if, under the circumstances of this case, it is proper to impose the charge is reasonseriously question, that the amount of this charge was reasonable, if under
-the circumstances, the charge should be imposed. Before the close of the
testimony the several defendants were requested by the Commission to
furnish statements showing the actual or estimate4 expense to them in
each case of making delivery from their several tracks to the Union Stock
Yards.
Such statements have been filed, and they make the following showing:

able. If any modification of the present findings is necessary,
they are hereby. modified to that extent."
The fact, however, that the terminal charge of $2 was intrinsically just and reasonable, was held by the Commission
not to show that such charge was just and reasonable "under
the circumstances of the case," for the following reasons: As
for many years the carriers had delivered to the stock yards
for the through rate prevailing from the point of shipment to
the point of delivery, they could not be assumed to have gratuitously performed the service of delivery. It was, therefore,
held that pay for such* service must be presumed to have been
embraced in the through rate. The through and reasonable
rate previbusly existing having been thus found to have embraced the cost of the terminal service, the Commission decided
that it was unjust and unreasonable to add to the charge for
terminal services, thus previously exacted, the arbitrary sum
of $2 per car, because the Stock Yards Company had imposed
for the first time, in .1894, an average charge of 81 per car. In
other words, the $2 terminal charge, although it was intrinsically reasonable when considered alone, became unreasonable
because it was an addition to the terminal charge necessarily
embraced in the pay for terminal services which had been included in the through rate existing for so many years.
The opinion of the Commission leaves no room for doubt that
such were its views on the subject. Thus stating the question
wvhich required to be decided, it was said: "Whether they (the
carriqrs) ought to make the charge they do, or any charge, or
whether the charge for delivery is already fairly included in the
rate, is a proposition of fact for consideration." Again, referring to the matter, the Commission said: "We do not believe
that these carriers should be allowed to add an arbitrary charge
to the Chicago rate, for doing a thing which they for thirty
years have said was included in that rate, and which we beheve, considering the manner inwhich rates are nade up and
in which this rate has been made up, ought to be included inthe rate;" and the following excerpts make the same thought
more clearly manifest: "We think and find that the Chicago
rate on May 31,.1894, included, as it had included .for the last

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 329
Opinion of the Court.

thirty years, a delivery and unloading of the stock at the Union

Stock Yards, and that rate, upon the record in this case, was a
just and reasonable one." Further, in calling attention to the
fact that the $2 terminal charge for the service of delivery at
the stock yards would be just and reasonable, "if that service
were performed by some independent agency," the Commission
pointed out that the charge was not just and reasonable when
made by the defendants, "because they were already receiving
compensation for this service, they ought not to charge for it
the second time." Further, it was said: "It is unreasonable to
impose this terminal charge for the reason that the rate to Chicago already includes that charge;" and the conclusion is
pointedly summed up.by the observation: "Surely the fact that
the railroad company is already receiving pay for this service
is good ground for holding that a second charge is unreasonable."
The finding of the Commission Was that the $2 additional
terminal charge was unjust and unreasonable, in so far as that
charge exceeded the sum which the carriers were actually
obliged to pay in consequence of the trackage charge imposed
by the Stock Yards Company. In other words, the Commis-"
sion held that the average sum which the defendants were
obliged to pay for the trackage charge was $1, and that this
sum might be added without causing the existing rate to become unreasonable.
A reargument of the case was permitted. The Commission
adhered to its original conclusions, and in addition held that as
the terminal charge violated the statute, because it was unreasonable, it therefore operated a discrimination against Chicago,
and hence was repugnant to the act to regulatecommerce in
this additional respect. The reasons by which the Commission
was controlled were reiterated in an opinion which so clearly
expresses the views entertained by it, which we have previously
summarized, that an extract from the report of the Commission
on the rehearing is excerpted in the margin.'
1" The Commission, itself did, however, state upon the hearing at various times, in terms upon.which the defendants were justified in relying,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

An order was issued by the Commission to carry out its conclusions.

In substance the order commanded the defendants

that no question could be successfully made as to the reasonableness of
this charge (the terminal charge in question) in certain aspects. Just exactly the scope of that intimation can be understood by referring to the
circumstances under which it was given. The defendants were proceeding
to show by testimony in each case that the actual cost to them of transporting these carloads of live stock, including the trackage charge and the
cost of unloading, was equal to or in excess of $2. Thereupon it was sug"gestedby the Commission, admitted by the inteivenor, and at first partly
admitted by the complainant, that the cost of service, including the trackage charge and the cost of unloading, was sufficient to justify the imposition of this terminal charge, provided, under the circumstances of this case,
it could be ptoperly imposed. We understand that the defendants are given
the full benefits of this in the report and opinion already filed. To remove
all doubt upon that subject, however, if it is not clearly found we now find
that, looking entirely to the cost of service and including as a part of that
cost the trackage charge paid the Union Stock Yards and Transit Company
and the unloading charge paid that same company, the amount of this terminal, if, under the circumstances of this case, it is proper to impose the
charge, is reasonable. If any modification of the present findings is necessary they are hereby modified to that extent. That finding must, however,
be carefully read in connection with the other facts in the case, and the
conclusion of the Commission that the imposition of this terminal charge
is reasonable. The defendants say it was admitted that this charge was
reasonable, 'provided any charge could be legally made for the terminal
service.' The intimation of the Commission was as indicated in the above
extract from the record, I that if this charge was proper to be imposed, it
was a reasonable charge.' The reason for the conclusion of the Commission is'to be found in the distinction between these two statements. What
the Commission passed upon finally was, not whether a terminal charge of
this sort could be legally made-that had been already determined by the
courts-but whether this particular charge could be properly imposed under
the circumstances of this case. To avoid misapprehension, we will restate
here the grounds for our decision, and for that purpose we confine attention
to this rate as it existed on May the 31st and June the 1st, 1894. On May
the 31st there was in effect a certain rate on live stock from various points
to Chicago, and that rate, upon the record in this case, must be taken to be
a just and reasonable one. The defendants intimate in their answer that
this rate has been forced down until it was too low, and something was said
in the proof looking in the same direction. Upon the other hand, the complainants started in to prove that the rate at that time was too high, but as
is found by the case both these claims were virtually abandoned. There is
nothing in the record before us to show that the rate was other than a right
one, and we assume that on May the 31st the rate in effect was just and

Opinion of the Court

whose lines of railway entered the city of Chicago to desist, on
and before a named date, from charging, demanding, collecting
reasonable. Now, just what did this live stock rate to Chicago include ?
The defendants insisted on the reargument of this case that it covered the
transportation of that live stock to the point where, on its way to the Union
Stock Yards, it left the tracks of these several defendants, and nothing
more. The complainant insisted that that rate covered a delivery of -the
stock at the stock yards. We are unable to see any ground whatever for
the contention of the defendants. As a matter of law, the undertaking to
transport live stock from one place to another includes a delivery of the
stock. Originally live stock brought to Chicago by these defendants must
be delivered at any one of four different points. This was necessitated by
the actual competitive conditions at that'market. The railway companies
for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of this kind of
delivery created the pres6nt stock yards.
"It was entirely at their suggestion and entirely for their benefit at the
outset. From the time the stock yards were constructed down to June 1,
1894, the various dcfendants had, by arrangement with the Stock Yards
Company, the right to use the tracks of that company for the delivery of
this stock at the Union Stock Yards. By the action of the various carriers
that became the only place in Chicago at which live stock could ordinarily
be delivered. Whenever a carload of live stock was shipped to Clicago,
in the absence of special directions, it was taken to the Union Stock Yards.
This was understood both by the carrier and by the shipper. No defendant had any facilities previous to June 1 for delivering live stock in any
quantity at any other point than at the Union Stock Yards. Now, in view
of the legal liability resting upon the carrier to make a delivery somewhere,
in view of the fact that this delivery must be made at the stock yards and
was habitually made there, it seems impossible that the defendants, in
making this rate from the point of shipment to Chicago, did not include in
that rate and contemplate as a part of the service covered by that rate a
delivery at the Union Stock Yards. It is absurd to say that the Chicago
rate paid for the transportation of that stock up to some switch in the field,
or in the city where there was no facility for a delivery, and that the transportation beyond that point was a gratuity. We think and find that the
Chicago rate on May 31, 1894, included, as it had included for the last thirty
years, a delivery and unloading of the stock at the Union Stock Yards, and
that rate, upon the record in this case, was a just and reasonable one.
"June 1, 1894, these defendants, by concerted agreement among themselves, increased this rate to $2.00 per car. If the rate on May 31 was a
just and reasonable one, the rate on June 1 was an unjust and unreasonable one, unless some new condition justified the imposition of that additional charge. We have found that to the extent of $1.00 a new condition
did justify the additional charge, for the reason that then, for the first time,

or receiving, in addition to their regular published transporta
tion charges, the sum of $2 per carload of live stock, as compensation for terminal services rendered in making delivery
thereof at the yards of the Union Stock Yards and Transit
Company in the city of Chicago. Embodied in the order was
the following recommendation:
"That said defendants be, and they severally are, hereby
recommended not to charge, demand, collect or receive in ex.cess of $1 per carload as compensation for terminal or switching services rendered in the delivery of live stock at the yards
of the Union Stock Yards and Transit Company in said city of
Chicago, which said sum of 81 per carload as compensation for
such ternfinal or switching services is found and declared in
and by said report and opinion to be just, reasonable and lawful."
In its opinion on the rehearing the Commission pointed out
the reasons which caused it to recommend that each railroad
exact only $1 for the additional terminal charge instead of the
actual sum which the railroads were obliged to disburse for the
trackage, charge. The passage from the opinion referring to
this subject is excerpted in the margin.1
It is to be observed that the Commission in the course of its
opinion expressly recognized the right of the defendant carthe Stock Yards Company exacted this trackage charge. In other words,
the coht of service to the defendants was increased by just $1.00 on that
day. It must follow, therefore, as a necessary conclusion, that of the increase which the defendants made, $1.00 was justifiable and $1.00 was unjustifiable. This is not, however, because $2.0 is an unreasonable charge
for transporting a car to the stock yards, if that service was performed by
some independent agency, but because, since the defendants were already
receiving compensation for this service, they ought not to charge for it the
second time. Of this proposition we have no doubt. Upon the assumption that the rate May 31 was a just one, we regard the imposition of anything above what the defendants were then compelled for the first time to
pay as an unwarranted exaction and a violation of the first section of the
act to regulate commerce, if it is possible to violate that section."
1 - The original opinion intimates that the only logical conclusion from
the reasoning there stated would be to allow each carrier to retain whatever that particular carrier is obliged to pay the Union Stock Yards and
Transit Company by way of this trackage charge. That would, however,

riers to increase their rates if they were unreasonably low. It
is also to be borne in mind that by necessary implication arising from the opinion of the Commission it is also clear that
that body likewise recognized the right of the defendant carriers under the circumstances of the particular case to segregate
their rates by separating the charge made for carriage from the
point of shipment to Chicago from the terminal services at that
point.
The defendants, refusing to comply with the order of the
Commission, that body filed a petition in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Northern District of Illinois to compel compliance. The defendants annexed and made, part of
their answers the responses which they had filed in the proceedings before the Commission. All the answers in effect
averred the reasonableness of the charge of $2, denied the discrimination and expressly alleged that the charge in question
constituted a separate terminal charge, embracing compensation for all the terminal services, and alleged that the effect of
the filing of the rate sheets with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the notice given to the public concerning the charge
of $2 had been to segregate the rates so as to distinguish the
entire terminal charge from the through rate. It was, moreover, expressly averred that at the time the terminal charge
was imposed the rates to Chicago on cattle from the points covered by the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Coinmission were unreasonably low, and, in view of the outlay
result in compelling all companies to retain the smallest amount paid, since
the terminal by all routes must be the same. We understood that in allowing $1 to be retained we were virtually giving to the carriers 20 cents
upon each car, but in view of the fact that many of the defendants were
compelled to pay $1.50 by way of trackage charge, this seemed, on the
whole, reasonable. Upon the reargument the defendants were inquired of
whether they desired a modification of this order so that each one be allowed to retain the amount actually paid, and without exception they stated
that they did not ask such a modification. Attention is called to this fact
at this time for the purpose of showing that what is apparently an inconsistency in the conclusion of the Commission is really in favor of the defendants, and that the defendants do not for that reason desire to have
that inconsistency removed."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

occasioned at Chicago in the rendering of the terminal services, the terminal charge of $2 was in any event a just and
reasonable increase of the then existing unreasonably low rate.
Before the Circuit Court the Commission contented itself with
introducing in evidence certified copies of the proceedings h~d
before it, other than the evidence taken by the Commission, and
with offering such evidence as competent proof in the case. Although, on objection, the court excluded the evidence in question, it was subsequently stipulated that the transcript thereof
need not be incorporated in the certificate of evidence signed
by the district judge, and that, notwithstanding the objections
interposed, the transcript might be produced to and inspected
by the Circuit Court of Appeals for any proper purpose in case
such inspection was deemed allowable. The evidence introduced on behalf of the railroad companies consisted only of
the circulars and tariff sheets which had been issued and filed
with the Commission, promulgating the charge in question.
After hearing, the Circuit Court found that such charge was
just and reasonable, and entered a decree dismissing the petition. 98 Fed. Rep. 173. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the decree of the Circuit
Court. 103 Fed. Rep. 249.
The court held, as to the right of the carrier to make a terminal charge, under the circumstances disclosed by the record,
that the case was controlled by .the ruling of the Circuit Court
pf Appeals in the case to which we have previously referred,
TWalker v. Keenan, 73 Fed. Rep. 755, and the reasoning in that
case was expressly approved. Coming to consider the question
'of the reasonableness of the terminal charge, the court held as
that rate, abstractedly considered, was just and reasonable, it
was in the concrete also just and reasonable, because the
through rate which had prevailed for thirty years, and- under
which the carriers had delivered to the stock yards, embraced
no charge for terminal services, such service having been performed during all the years in question gratuitously. Besides;
the court considered that the filing of the schedules in 1894
with a memorandum as to the terminal charge of $2 had operated the segregation of the two rates. The views of the court

Opinion of the Court.

on this subject were thus stated in its opinion, 103 Fed. Rep.
249, p. 251:
"Prior to June 1, 1894, the railway companies seem to have
assumed this burden themselves, but at' this' time a trackage
was imposed by the stock yards of from 40 to 75 cents each way
upon every car going and returning from the tracks of the railway company to the stock yards. It is insisted that, as this is
the only extra expense then occasioned, any charge beyond that
was unreasonable and improper. I do not think that necessarily follows. While the imposition of this trackage charge by
the Union Stock Yards was doubtless the immediate occasion
for a reformation of its tariff, the railway companies were then
at liberty to adopt a new schedule with relation to these terminal facilities and charge what they actually cost them."
We are thus brought to consider the issue involved, that is,
the reasonableness of the rate.
As the right of the defendant carriers to divide their rates
and thus to make a distinct charge from the point of shipment
to Chicago and a separate terminal charge for delivery to the
stock yards, a point beyond the lines of the respective carriers,
was conceded by the Commission and was upheld by the Circuit Court of Appeals, no contention on this subject arises. If,
despite this concurrence of opinion, controversy was presented
on the subject, we see no reason to doubt, under the facts of
this case, the-correctness of the rule as to the right to divide the
rate, admitted by the Commission and announced by the court
below. This is especially the case in view of the sixth section
of the act to regulate commerce, wherein it is provided that the
schedules of rates to be filed by carriers shall "state separately
the terminal charges and any rules or regulations which could
in anywise change, affect or determine any part of the aggregate of said aforesaid rates and fares and charges." Whether
the rule which we approve as applied to the facts in this case
would be applicable to terminal services by a carrier on his own
line which he was obliged to perform as a necessary incident of
his cohtract to carry, and the performance of which was demanded of him by the shipper, is a question which does not
arise on this record, gnd as to which we are, therefore, called
upon to express no opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

We come, then, to consider whether there was a separation of
the charge for carriage and the charge for the terminal services, and whether the rate-separated or aggregated, as may be
found to be the case-was just and reasonable. To determine
these questions, it is essential to fix the situation prior to June,
1894, at which time the increased terminal charge was first imposed. Undoubtedly prior to that date the published rate sheets
of the defendants embraced only a rate from the point of shipment to Chicago, the place of delivery. There is room, even,
for no pretence that there was in such schedules asetting apart
of the terminal charge from the through rate. There is also
no room for question that during the many years these rate
sheets were in force the carriers, under their contracts to carry
to Chicago, delivered carloads of cattle to the stock yards without making any charge other than that which was specified in
the througgh rate. Under these circumstances, in the absence
of proof, can it be assumed that the carriers were, for the many
years inquestion, gratuitously performing the terminal services?
'That such assumption may not be indulged in results from the
ruling in- Covington Stock Yards v. Keith, 139 U. S. 128, where
it was decided that, as for a through to a given point, the carrier contracted to deliver at that point, the presumption was
that the through rate included adequate compensation for the
services rendered at the point of delivery. Applying this principle, it results that the through rate existing prior to June the 1st,
1894, certainly in the absence of proof to the contrary, must be
presumed to-have provided in and of itself compensation for the
services rendered in making d-ivery at the stock yards. Did
the carriers; in June, 1894, when they imposed the alleged
terminal charge of $2,separate in their schedules this charge
from the through rate? That is, did they. divide their charges
by setting apart the terminal charge embraced in their previous
through rate so as to segregate it from the through rate, thus making one distinct terminal charge and another distinct through
rate? The mere inspection of the schedules demonstrates that
such division was not made. This is the convincing result, since
the schedules -did not purport to draw out from the previous
through rate the sum of compensation contained therein for

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 337
Opinion of the Court.

terminal services. On the contrary, the entire previous through
rate was retained, and a memorandum was placed upon the
schedules to the effect that thereafter an additional charge of
$2 for delivery at the stock yards would be exacted. This was
a mere addition to the sum of the terminal charge embraced in
the prior through rate. We think that it cannot be said that
to add an additional amount to a former charge was necessarily
to divide such former charge, without holding that to add one
sum to another is necessarily to divide the other. The act to
regulate commerce exacts that the schedules to be printed and
filed by carriers must plainly state "the places upon the railroad between which property and passengers will be carried,
and shall contain the classification of freight in force, and shall
also state separately the terminal charges and any rules or regulations which in anywise change, affect or determine any part
or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates and fares and charges."
The purpose of this provision was to compel the schedules to be
so drawn as to plainly inform of their import, was to exact that
when the rates were changed the change should be so stated as
not to mislead and confuse, all of which would be frustrated if
the schedules relied upon were given the effect which the defendants now claim for them. And the reasons just given dispose
of the contention that because it was found that the terminal
charge of $2, abstractly considered, would be just and reasonable, therefore itshould have been held to have been just and
reasonable as applied to the case in hand. This obscures the
fact that compensation for the terminal service was -presumptively included in the through rate existing for so many years,
and therefore, the $2 did not constitute the terminal rate, but
that such rate after the $2 was imposed consisted of that sum
plus the amount of compensation for the terminal- service which
had always been contained in, and which continued. to be embraced in, the through rate.
Under the foregoing conditions, was the' imposition by the
railroads of the -additional charge of $2 just and reasonable,
measured by the criterion which the Commission adopted, that
is, " under the circumstances of the case? " It needs no reasoning to demonstrate that the Commission correctly held that the

OCTOBER TERM', 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

mere imposition by the Stock Yards Company of a new burden,
averaging $1 per car, did not justify an additional charge by
the carriers of $2 per car. It is likewise equally plain that if
the prior rate was just and reasonable, as the Commission found
it to be, that the addition, without reason, of $2 per car, caused
the rate to become unjust and unreasonable to the extent of the
$1 extra.

It follows that the order of the Commission was right if its
correctness depends upon the considerations previously stated.
But such is not the case. In the report on the original hearing
the Commission said:
"If the through rate were what was really aimed at by the
complaint, then all ground of complaint has been removed since
the complaint itself was filed. About October the 1st, 1896,
rates on live stock from points embraced in the territory covered by this complaint to all western markets, including Chicago,
were reduced five cents per one hundred pounds. This would
amount to from ten to fifteen dollars per car. Therefore the
Texas shipper would actually'deliver his stock in Chicago for
from eight to thirteen dollars per carload cheaper than he could
before the $2 rate was imposed, and all the complaint asks for
is the abolishment of that terminal charge. This charge is imposed by the terminal carriers at* Chicago, and those carriers
receive and retain the amouht of that charge. The complaint
is that this charge is an unlawful one; that no matter what the
Chicago rate may be the addition of this particular sum to that
rate is in violation of the act to regulate commerce."
In other words, it was held that the rate, which was unjust
and.unreasonable solely because of the $1 excess, continued to
be unjust and unreasonable after this rate had been reduced
.by from ten to fifteen dollars. This was based, not upon a finding of fact-as of- course it could not have been so based--but
rested alone on the ruling by the Commission that it could not
consider the reduction in the through rate, but must confine its
attenti& to the $2 terminal rate, since that alone was the subject-matter of the cdmplaint. But, as we have previously shown,
the Commission, in considering the terminal rate, had expressly
found that it was less than the cost of service, and was there-

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 339
Opinion of the Court.

fore intrinsically just and reasonable, and could only be treated
as unjust and unreasonable by considering "the circumstances
of the case;" that is, the through rate and the fact that a terminal charge was included in it, which, when added to the two
dollar charge, caused the terminal charge as a whole to be unreasonable. Having therefore decided that the $2 terminal
charge could only be held to be unjust and unreasonable by
combining it with the charge embraced in the through rate,
necessarily the through rate was entitled to be taken into consideration if the previous conclusions of the Commission were
well founded. It cannot be in reason said that the inherent
reasonableness of the terminal rate, separately considered, is
irrelevant because its reasonableness is to be determined by considering the through rate and the terminal charge contained in
it, and yet when the reasonableness of the rate is demonstrated,
by considering the through rate as reduced, it be then held that
the through rate should not be considered. In other words, two
absolutely conflicting propositions cannot at the same time be
adopted. As the finding was that both the terminal charge of
$2 and the thrbugh rate as reduced when separately considered
were just and reasonable, and as the further finding was that
as a consequence of the reduction of from ten to fifteen dollars
per car, the rates, considered together, were just and reasonable,
it follows that there can be no possible view of the case by which
the conclusion that the rates were unjust and unreasonable can
be sustained.
These views dispose of the case, but before concluding we
advert to a statement made by the Commission in its opinion
delivered on the reargument. The expression referred to is as
follows :
"It is also said that since the imposition of this terminal
charge the Chicago rate has been reduced so that the total
amount to-day, including the terminal charge, is much less than
it was in 1894, when the charge was imposed. The case finds
that such a reduction was made about October 1, 1896. The
reduction did not, however, apply to all the territory to which
the terminal charge applies, but only to certain limited portions
of that territory, and the purpose of it was to equalize the rate

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

from those sections as compared with other sections.

There is

no claim that this reduction was made on account of the imposition of the terminal charge, or that it would not have been
made had no terminal charge been imposed, nor that if the
Chicago rate, June 1, 1894, ought to have carried with it a delivery at the stock yards the present rate should not likewise
do so."
It is apparent that there is an irreconcilable conflict between
the statement thus made and the facts as recited by the Commission in its first report, for therein it was declared that the
reduction applied C" to live stock from points embraced in the
territory covered by this complaint to all western markets in" The report deduced from this precluding Chicago.
mise of fact the conclusion that if the through rate could be
considered "all ground of complaint has been removed" by
the reduction. We find it in reason difficult to treat the statements made after the reargument as substantive findings of fact,
overthrowing the facts stated in the first report, for this reason:
In the passage which we have. already excerpted from the
report of -the Commission announced after the reargument, it
will be seen that it-is declared that the previous findings are
modified to the extent necessary to make it clearly appear that
the terminal rate of $2 independently considered had been
found unquestionably .to be reasonable, and there is no expression in the report on the reargument tending to show that it
was the purpose to modify in other particulars the findings as
previously inade. The case, therefore, reduces itself to this:
The finding in the first report is that the reduction applied to
the whole territory and removed all ground of complaint if the
through rate could be considered, whilst the statement in the
report after the reargument i that the reduction in the through
rate did not apply to the whole territory, but was only partial.
Aside from this difficulty another confronts us. The first finding of the Commission was that both the through rate and the
terminal rate, selparately considered as distinct charges, were
in and of themselves just and reasonable at the time the complaint was filed, and this is expressly reiterated in the report
delivered after the reargument. Now the passage which we

INTER. COM. COMMIS'N v. CHICAGO &c. R'D CO. 341
Opinion of the Court.

have just previously excerpted from the report after the rear.gument states that the reduction of the through rate was partial,
and applied only to portions of the territory, and that it was
made in order to "equalize the rates from those sections as
compared with other sections." But it is impossible in reason
to accept this conclusion, even if it be treated as a finding of
fact, if the finding made originally and reiterated after the reargument is to be applied, that is, that the rates when separately considered were just and reasonable. This is necessarily
the case, since in consonance with reason it cannot at the same
time be declared that the rates separately considered were just
and reasonable at the time the complaint was filed, and yet it
be found that some of the just and reasonable rates were unequal, and hence unjust, and required to be changed in order to
remove the inequality, and therefore the unreasonableness
which existed in them. If, however, the conflicts to which we
have referred be put out of view and the statement in the report
after the reargument, to which we have adverted, be treated
as a substantive finding and as overthrowing by implication the
findings expressly made in the first report and some of those
expressly reiterated in the second report, we find ourselves
nevertheless unable to reverse the court below and direct the
execution of the order entered by the Commission. That order
was general and operated upon all the carriers in the whole
territory covered by the complaint. But if the statement on
the rehearing which we are considering be taken as a finding
and given, arguwndo, the force previously stated, then it follows
that the rate from the points in the territory to which the reduction applied were just and reasonable, and as to those points
the order should not have been rendered, and there is no finding establishiig the points to which the reduction applied which
would enable us to separate the reasonable from the unreasonable rates. It results that the findings do not afford the basis
of even sustaining the order in part. Whether or not, in making the reduction, the terminal charge entered into the minds
of th6 carriers is a matter of no concern. The question is, was
the rate as reduced just and reasonable?
Being then constrained to the conclusion that the order of

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
-, Syllabus.

the Commission was not sustained by the facts upon which it
was predicated, we cannot. enter into an independent investigation of the facts, even if it be conceded the record is in a condition to enable us to do so, in order that new and substantive
findings of fact may be evolved, upon which the order of the
Commission may be sustained. Louisville &c. 1R. 1. Co. v.
Behirmer, 175 U. S. 648-675.
It follows that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
which affirmed the decree of the Circuit Court, refusing to command compliance with the order of the Commission, was right,
"and it must, therefore, be affirmed. We think, however, in view
of what has been said, and in order to prevent all possible misconception, that it should be stated that nothing in the decree
refusing to execute the order of the Commission should be construed as preventing that body, if it deems it best to do so,
from hereafter commencing proceedings to correct any unreasonableness in the rate resulting from the additional terminal
charge as to any territory to which the reduction referred to
in the opinion, if any such there .be, did not apply.
The dearee of the Court of -Appealsis therefore affirmed without prejudice to the right of the Commission to hereafter
proceed in accordance with the reservation expressed in the
