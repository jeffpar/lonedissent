FARMERS' LOAN AND TRUST COMPANY v. PENN
PLATE GLASS COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT.
No. 180. Argued April 24, 25,1902.-Decided June 2,1902.

This was a suit in equity, brought by the petitioner, in the United States
Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, commenced to
foreclose a mortgage given January 1, 1891, by The Pennsylvania Plate
Glass Company upon. its property in the county of Westmoreland and
State of Pennsylvania:, to The Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, to secure the payment of $250,000 of bonds then to be issued by the mortgagor
company. A decree was entered by direction of the Circuit Court, providing for the foreclosure and sale of the property and for the application of th6 insurance moneys as prayed for. Upon appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals the decree of the Circuit Court was reversed as to the
insurance moneys, and the court below was directed to enter a decree that
those moneys should be paid to the defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Company. The material facts in the case are stated in the opinion of the
court. The only question involved arose from the provision made in the
decree by the Circuit Court judge, impressing what is termed an equitable lien upon the insurance moneys collected on the policies taken out by
The Penn Company, sufficient to pay any balance which may remain unpaid on the bonds secured by the mortgage to complainant, after the
application of the proceeds of the sale of the property mortgaged. The
Circuit Court held that the complainant had such equitable lien, while
the Circuit Court of Appeals was of the contrary opinion. Held that the
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.

Statement of the Case.
THIS is a suit in equity, brought by the petitioner, in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the case comes here on certiorari to the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The suit was commenced to
foreclose a mortgage given January 1, 1891, by The Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company (hereinafter called the mortgagor
company) upon its property in the county of Westmoreland and
State of Pennsylvania, to complainant, The Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company, a corporation of INew York, to secure the payment of $250,000 of bonds then to be issued by the mortgagor
company. A supplemental bill was filed, by leave of the court,
which averred a loss by fire of a large portion of the premises
mortgaged, and on the allegations contained in the supplemental
bill the complainant asked that a decree should be entered granting to it a lien on the insurance moneys to the extent necessary
to pay the bondholders the balance which might be due, after
applying to their payment the proceeds of the sale of the property mortgaged. A decree was entered by direction of the Circuit Court, providing for the foreclosure and sale of the property
and for the application of the insurance moneys as prayed for.
Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the decree of the
Circuit Court was reversed as to the insurance moneys, and the
court below was directed to enter a decree that those moneys
should be paid to the defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Company, Circuit Judge Acheson dissenting. The opinion of the
judge of the Circuit Court, as well as those delivered in the Circuit Court, of Appeals, will be found reported in 103 Fed. Rep.
132.
The material facts in the case are as follows: The Farmers'
Loan and Trust Company is a corporation of the Statb of New
York. The defendant, The Pennsylvania Plate Glass Coinpany
(the mortgagor company), is a corporation of the State of Pennsylvania, organized for the purpose of constructing and operating
plate glass works in the city of Irwin in that State. The defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Company, is also a corporation
of the'State of Pennsylvania, and is also organized for the purpose of constructing and operating plate glass works in the same
city. The defendantWilliam L. Kann is a citizen of the State

of Pennsylvania.

On January 1,1891, the mortgagor company
executed to the complainant trust compatiy a mortgage on its
property in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, to secure the
payment of $250,000 of bonds as therein stated. Among other
things it was provided by article I of the mortgage that, until
default should be made in the payment of, the principal or interest of the bonds secured by the mortgage, or in the performance of some one or more of the covenants, stipulations or agreements required by the mortgage to be kept, performed or done
by the mortgagor, it was to be permitted, to possess and operate the premises and glass works with the appurtenances described in the mortgage.
By articles 2 and 3 it was provided that in case default should
be made in the payment of any installment of the interest on
any of the bonds or of any of the coupons accompanying the
same, or in the performance of any of the covenants, agreements or stipulations contained in the mortgage and therqby
required to be kept and performed by the mortgagor, and if
such default continued for six months after demand made in
writing, the mortgagee might take possession of the property,
or foreclosure 1 roce~dings might be taken.
By article 4 the mortgagor is exempted from all personal liability for the mortgaged debt, and from the obligations of the
other covenants contained in the mortgage, the article providing as follows:
"It being expressly understood and agreed by and between
the partieshereto, and by and between the said party of the
first part and the respective holders of the said several bonds,
collectively, that no other suit or proceeding for the collection
of any part of the principal or interest represented by the said
bonds and coupons shall ever be commenced or prosecuted,

either against the party of the first part, 6r any of its officers,
directors or shareholders, either by the said holders of the said
bonds or coupons or any of them, or by any person or corporation to whom the same or any of, them may be assigned or
transferred, except such suits or proceedings as shall be necessary to recover the possession of the said premises hereby conveyed or 'to subject the same to the payment of the said debts,

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 437
Statement of the Case.

and that the sale of the said mortgaged premises, whether under the power of sale hereby granted, or any other power of
sale, or by or under any judicial proceedings whatsoever, shall
operate-as a full and complete satisfaction and discharge of the
indebtedness of the said party of the first part upon the said
bonds and the coupons accompanying the same, and of the obligation of the covenants herein contained, whether the said premises shall be bidden in for the whole amount of skid indebtedness
or for a less price, anything in the said bonds and coupons or
therein contained, to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.'
It was provided by article 10, among other things, as follows:
"The right of action under this indenture is vested exclusively in the trustee, and under no circumstances shall any
bondholder or bondholders have any right tp institute an action
or other proceeding on or under this indenture, for the purpose
of enforcing any remedy herein and hereby provided, or of foreclosing-this mortgage, except in case of refusal on the part of
the trustee to perform any duty imposes on it by this agreement ; and all actions and proceedings for the -urpose 6f enforcing the provisions'of this indenture shall be instituted and
conducted by the trustee according to its sound discretion;
but the trustee shall be under no- obligation to institute Any
such suit, or to take any proceedings under this indenture, or
to enter any appearances, or in any way defend in any- suit in
which it may be made defendant, or to do anything whatever
as trustee,until it sall' be indemnified to its satisfaction from
any and all costs and expenses, outlays and counsel fees, and
other reasonable .disbursements, and from all possible claims
for damages, for which it may become-liable or responsible on
proceeding to carry ouf such request or demand. The trustee
may, nevertheless, begin suit, or appear in and defend suit, or
do anything else in its judgment proper to be done by it as such
trustee, without such, indemnity, and in such case it shall be
compensated therefor from the trust fund.
"The trustee shall be under no obligation to recognize any
person as holder or owner of any bonds secured hereby, or to
do or refrain from doing any act pursuant to the request or de-

mand of any person, until such supposed holder or owner shall
produce said bonds and deposit the same with the trustee.
"It shall be no part of thd duty of the party of the second
part to file or record this indenture as a mortgage or conveyance of real estate or as a chattel mortgage, or to renew such
mortgage, or to procure any further, other or additional instrument of further assurance, or to do any other act which
may be suitable and proper to be done for the continuance of
the lien hereof, or for giving notice of the existence of such
lien, or for -extending or supplementing the same; nor shall it
be any part of its duty to effect insuranbe against fire or other
damage on any portion of the mortgaged property, or to renew
any policies of insurance, or to keep itself informed or advised
as to the payment of any taxes or assessments, or to require
such payment to be made; but the trustee may, in its discretion, do any or all of the matters and things in this paragraph
set forth, or require the same to be done. It shall only be responsible for reasonable diligence in the performance of the
trust, and shall not be answerable in any case for the act or
default of any agent, attorney or employ6 selected with reasonable discretion; it shall be entitled to be reinbursed for all
prope outlays of every sort or nature by it incurred in the discharge of its trust, and to receive a reasonable and proper.compensation for any services that it may at any time perform in
the discharge of the same; and all such fees, commissions, compensation and disbursements shall constitute a lien on the mortgaged property and premises."
Many other provisions and cQnditions were contained in the
mortgage, which are not material to be mentioned.
Most of the moneys arising from the issuing of these bonds
were applied towards the construction of the plant of the mortgagor company at its place of business in the city of Irwin,
Pennsylvania. The company soon got into financial difficulties,
and about January, 1894, the defendant Kann became a stockholder therein and was elepted its treasurer. By March 19,
1894, the company had become involved in litigation, and was
very greatly embarrassed financially, and some of the other
officers of the company had. disagreements with Kann in regard

Statement of the Case.
to his advances of money, so that on the day last named a bill
in equity was filed against the company, in the name of some
of its creditors and directors, in the Court ,of Common Pleas
of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, praying among other
things for the appointment of a receiver of the property of the
company, and for a decree winding up its busin6ss. In that
suit Joseph W. Stoner, the then secretary of the company, was
appointed receiver, and such proceedings were had therein that
on or about June 18, 1894, the court made an order for the
sale of all the property of the mortgagor company, and the same
was sold at public auction to defendant Kann for the sum of
$37,500, he being the highest bidder at the sale, which was open
and public, and attended by others who made bids on the property. The sale was made subject to the mortgage to the complainant, and a deed was given by the receiver, pursuant to the
order of the court, to Kann, the deed bearing date July 2, 1894,
and reciting that the property was thereby conveyed "subject to
a mortgage made by said Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company
to The Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of the State of New
York, dated first of January, 1891, recorded in Westmoreland
County, in mortgage book No. 43, page 1," and being the mortgage or deed of trust made to complainant as stated. Kann
continued in possession as owner of the property under this
deed from the receiver until about July 1, 1895, when he conveyed, by deed dated on that day, all of the mortgaged property, together with the improvements made thereon by himself,
to the defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Company, for a consideration named in the deed of $83,500. Kann in his evidence says the consideration really amounted'to $118,000. The
deed from Kann to the company also recited that the property
therein conveyed was "subject to a mortgage made by said
Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company to The Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company of the State of New York, dated first of January, 1891, recorded in Westmoreland County, in mortgage
book No. 43, page 1-'
While Kann held the property he paid the interest on the
bonds, but default was made in the payment of the coupons
maturing on July 1, 1895, and no coupons have been paid since
that time.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

There was some insurance on the property when it went into
the hands of the receiver in the suit which was commenced to
wind up the affairs of the company, a portion of which insurance had not been paid for at the time of the appointment of the
receiver, and he thereupon secured directions from the court to
maintain the insurance, and for the purpose of paving the premiums thereon he issued receiver's certificates under the order
of the court. Some but not all of this insurance was still in
force when the receiver turned the property over to Kann at
the time of the deed, July 2, 1894. This insurance expired by
the lapse of time, and afterwards, and while Kann was in possession of the property under his deed from the receiver, he procured insurance upon his own interest therein and in his own
name. These policies subsequently expired. The Penn Company when organized, and after it had purchased the property,
took out insurance in its own name upon the same and for its
own benefit exclusively, the Amounts running from $250,000 to
ahout $400,000, and the policies containing this provision:
"This property is subject to a bonded indebtedness of $250,000,
but it is distinctly understood and agreed that this insurance
does not cover the interest of the bondholders." There was no
insurance on the property during the time that the Penn Company owned it, other than as just stated, but that insurance was
to an amount more than sufficient to secure the bondholders
under the mortgage if the moneys were to be so applied.
While the property was in the hands of Kann and after the
insurance thereon had expired, which had been procured by the
mortgagor company or by its receiver, the mortgagee notified
Kann and required him to keep up or renew or take out other
insurance for .the benefit of the bondholders under the mortgage,
up to the amount thereof, and the same notice and-requirement
were given to and demanded of the mortgagor company. That
company made default and Kann refused to take out any such
insurance, and denied that he was under any obligation so to do.
After Kann sold and conveyed the property to the Penn Company, the complainant notified that company and required it to
insure ina sum sufficient to afford security for the bondholders
under the mortgage to complainant. The Penn Company re-

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 441
Statement of the Case.
fused to so insure and denied any obligation to do so, but, on
the contrary, did insure for its own benefit, the policies of insurance containing the provision excluding the interest of the
bondholders under the mortgage.
As stated, the mortgagor company, and also Kann and the
Penn Company, defaulted in the payment of the boupons due
July 1,. 1895, and upon those due January 1 and July 1, 1896,
and thereupon complainant commenced this suit by the filing
of its bill July 8, 1896, asking for the foreclosure of the mortgage, and making the mortgagor company, Kann and the Penn
Company defendants. On the same day a motion for a receiver
was noticed on the ground that the mortgage was not good
security for the debt. The mortgagor company made default
and has not appeared in the suit. The other defendants duly
appeared and opposed the motion. It was heard on July 20,
1896. Shortly after the motion had been argued counsel for the
complainant received notice from the judge before whom the
motion had been made, stating that he had concluded to deny
the application for the appointment of a receiver. Upon"a subsequent day, the parties being in court, (no formal order denying the motion having as yet been -filed,) the counsel for the
complainant said to the court that in the motion for a receiver
it occurred to him that the court had not considered the fact
that this property was without insurance; that there was danger of fire; that the plaintiff was a trustee without funds, and
that that was a matter that ought to be considered; that the
trustee was entitled to insurance. Counsel upon the other side
denied that they were bound to insure iinder the terms of the
mortgage, and so the dispute continued before the judge, counsel
for the complainant insisting that complainant should have insurance and counsel for the other side denying that complainant
was entitled to it at the cost of the defendants, and at the end
the judge remarked that he could not then decide that question,
but intimated to counsel for defendants that if they were bound
to insure they ought to protect the complainant as trustee and
mortgagee. Finally it was suggested that a bond should be
given of the tenor now to be mentioned, but counsel for complainant stated in his evidence upon the subject given in this

OCTOBER TERMA,

Statement of the Case.

case, that he did not wish to be misunderstood, and that it must
be admitted that counsel for the defendants, upon the occasion
mentioned, expressly denied that they were bound to insure for
the benefit of the bondholders; the bond or agreement was
given just as its terms set forth, that if defendants were bound
to insure the insurance would stand for the benefit of the complainant, and if not, the complainant would get nothing. The
bond or agreement was then given by Emanuel Wertheimer
and defendant Kann. It was put in evidence, and Wertheimer
and Kaun therein agreed "that in the event of a loss by fire of
the property described in the said Pennsylvania Plate Glass
Company mortgage, that then there shall be paid out to the said
Farmers' L6an and Trust Company, trustee, in trust for the
holders of valid bonds secured by the said mortgage, a sum
equal to the total amount of such valid bonds, out of the policies
of insurance existing in favor of the Penn Plate Glass Company.
Provided, that it shall have been fin'ally adjudicated that the
Penn Plate Glass Company, the present owner of said property,
is bound or liable by anything contained in the said mortgage,
or the terms of its purchase of the described mortgaged premises, to keep and maintain insurance for the benefit of the holders of bonds secured by the said mortgage." This agreement
was given, as counsel for complainant stated, in order to meet
the views of the court, "that if I was entitled to insurance I
should have a bond, and if I was not entitled to insurance, I
would get nothing."
By an interlocutory order, as mentioned in the decree subsequently entered, and grounded upon this agreement, the court
appointed Emanuel Wertheimer as receiver for the purpose of
receiving the insurance moneys under the various policies of insurance, and, pursuant to such appointment, Wertheimer was
directed to hold, as such receiver, $125,000 of the insurance
moneys so collected, and if it should be finally decreed that the
complainant had an equitable lien upon such insurance moneys,
then the receiver was to pay over to the complainant so much
of that sum as should be necessary to pay and discharge the
$90,000 of the bonds secured by the mortgage, not including
the $160,000 of such bonds belonging to Wertheimer, in regard

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. w. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 44g
Counsel for Parties.

to which he released and waived all claim to an equitable lien
upon the said sum of $125,000 so collected and held by him, and
he was also to pay to the complainant and discharge the coupons
upon such $90,000 of bonds.
The formal order denying the .motion for a receiver was filed
September 7, 1896. Considerable testimony was taken in -the
case subsequently to that time upon the various issues made by
the pleadings, but the trial had not been conoluded, when on
April 12, 1898, a fire occurred, by reason of which, as claimed
on the part of the mortgagee, the greater part of its security
was destroyed. A supplemental bill was then filed by complainant by leave of court, and various insurance companies which
had insured the property for The Penn Company were brought
in as parties to the suit, and the bomplainant demanded, in addition to the relief which was prayed for in the original bill, a
decree providing that the complainant should have a first lien
on the insurance moneys paid or to be paid under such policies
for the purpose of paying the bondholders holding the $90,000
of bonds as above mentioned, any balance which might be due
them after the sale of the mortgaged premises should be made,
if such sale should result in any deficiency in the payment of
those bonds.
Testimony was taken relative to the averments contained in
the supplemental bill. It was proved on behalf of The Penn
Company that since Kann and The Penn Company had the title
to and possession of the property, there had been spent by them
upon the property, by w.ay of repairs and improvements, between
$180,000 and $200,000.
The decree of the Circuit Court, after providing for the foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged premises, made specific provision for the application of the insurance moneys in the hands
of Wertheimer to the payment of any deficiency that might
arise, after applying the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
property to the payment of the bonds medtioned in the decree.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
YR. JUSTICE PEOKHAx, after making the foregoing statement
of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.

The only question involved in this case arises from the provision made in the decree by the Circuit Court Judge, impressing what is termed an equitable lien upon the insurance moneys
collected on the policies taken out by The Penn Company, sufficient to pay any balance which may remain unpaid on the
bonds secured by the mortgage to complainant, after the application of the proceeds of the sale of the property mortgaged.
The Circuit Court held that the complainant had such equitable
lien, while the Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Acheson dissenting, was of the contrary opinion, and therefore reversed
that portion of the decree which provided for it.
The policies upon which the moneys were collected to pay
the loss happening by fire, were taken out by The Penn Company for the purpose of covering its own interest in the property, and the language of the policies covered such interest
only. There was no contract in the policies covering the interest of the complainant as mortgagee, nor was the insurance,
in fact, effected for the purpose of carrying out any agreement
or obligation on the part of The Penn Company with the complainant to effect insutance covering the interest of the bondholders. On the contrary, this purpose was disaffirmed and
the obligation denied. The Penn Company had the right to
insure its own interest, and unless there was some contractual
obligation on its part on the subject, which bound it, or some
conduct on its part, or on the part of Kann, its immediate
grantor, which would estop it from setting up the fact that it
had procured the insurance for itself, the moneys arising out
of the contracts which it made with the various insurance conpanies, cannot be taken from it and bestowed on the complainant for the benefit of the bondholders secured by the mortgage
in suit. Some obligation of the defendant of a contractual nature must exist, or some conduct must be proved, estopping
the defendant from denying such obligation, before the court
can be authorized to take such moneys and bestow them upon
the mortgagee for the benefit of the bondholders.

FARMERUS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 445
Opinion of the Court.

The complainant asserts that, without regard to 'any -pro-vision in the mortgage, it has an equitable lien upon The Penn
Company's insurance, and that, under the circumstances, such
company must be treated as in the position of a receiverappointed on complainant's motion in this'case. The peculiar
circumstances uponwhioh the claim is based tbat defendants
should be so treated, seem principally to be the denial of complainant's motion for the appointment of a receiver at the time
of the commencement of this suit to foreclose the mortgage,
and the fact that The Penn Company had insurance on the
property. The denial of the motion for a receiver, it is
averred, was brought about by the. opposition of the defendants Kann and The Penn Company, and it is argued that they
ought not to have opposed the motion, and their opposition
was improper and in bad faith. But it must be remembered
they were parties to the suit, and in the legal protection of
their rights it was perfectly proper for them to oppose, before
the court, the appointment of a receiver, even though their opposition secured the denial of the complainant's motion. We
see nothing upon which to base an accusation of bad faith ii
this conduct of defendants. The complainant, however, regards the application for a receiver as the sanrre in substance
as an application to take possession of the pfemises in pursuance of the provisions of the mortgage, consequent upon a
default in the payment of the principal or interest of the bonds,
or because of a violation of any other of the covenants contained in such mortgage. Even if that. be so, we see nothing
in such fact to in any way alter the right of defendants to oppose by argument before the court the appointment of a receiver. There is :no pretence that they made any allegatiopr
upon the hearing which were untrue-or that their oppositionwas based upon anything other than conceded facts. Possibly
the Circuit Court ought to have appointed a receiver ulion the
application of the complainant. That was a matter resting a
good deal in its sound discretion. The Penn Company and
Kann were, however, entirely wvithin their legal rights when
they opposed such application, and we are unable to see that
their conduct in so doing in any manner altered those rights

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

or added to their own legal obligations. Very likely a receiver, if he had been appointed, would on his own motion
have taken out insurance upon the property, or would have
been directed by the court to do so, in order to cover the interest of the bondholders. But no receiver was appointed and
no such insurance was taken out, and we cannot see that the
defendant, The Penn Company, has in any manner made itself
liable to pay to the complainant any of the insurance moneys
which it obtained to cover its own interest only, in the property,
because of the successful opposition made by it to the appointment of a receiver.
The court on hearing all sides and interests denied the application. Thbre was nothing which then prevented the complainant from itself taking out insurance under the tenth article of
the mortgage. It could have taken out such insurance as a
thing proper to be done by it as trustee within the provisions
of the mortgage, and in such case it would have been entitled,
by the specific provisions in the tenth article, to reimbursement
therefor and to compensation from the trust fund. We do not
say that it was its duty to do so, for it had no cash of the mortgagor on hand, but it had the power under the article to advance the insurance premiums and the right to demand reimbursement and compe~lsation for having done so. The fact that
it had no funds at its command at that time is very likbly an
answer to the proposition that it was its duty to have itself procured insurance; but if it had advanced the money and thus
procured the insurance, the amount which it advanced would
have been a lien on the trust fund and payable thereout before
any claim on the part of the bondholders could have been asserted. The risk of loss to the complainant by making such
advances would have been nothing. We refer to the subject
to show that the mere fact that the trustee was without actual
cash in hand to procure the insurance is not material.
Nor can we see that the execution of the agreement soon
after the court had decided to deny the application for the receiver, in any way affects the liability of the defendants on this
branch of the case. From the time that Kann bought the premises on the receiver's sale and took a deed therefor subject to

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 447
Opinion of the Court.

the mortgage, he denied any liability on his part to insure the
premises for, the bondholders, and refused so to do, and The
Penn Company from the time it became the purchaser of the
premises, also denied any liability to insure and refused to do
it. The denial of this obligation to insure and the refusal on
the part of both Kann and The Penn Company had been explicit, open and continuous from the time the property had first
been acquired up to the bearing upon the motion for a receiver.
Whether the defendants or either of them were bound to insure for the benefit of the bondholders was a question which
the Circuit Court said it could not decide at that time. This
was after the court had stated its determination to deny the
motion for a receiver. Finally it was agreed between counsel
who were then before the court that Kann and Wertheimer
would sign an agreement that in the event of a loss bjr fire there
should be paid to complainant out of the policies of insurance
existing in favor of The. Penn Company a sum equal to the
total amount of valid bonds secured by the mortgage, provided
it was finally adjudicated that the company, the then owner
of the.property, was bound or liable by anything contained in'
the mortgage or the terms of its purchase of the described mortgaged premises, to keep and mainthin insurance for the benefit
of the holders of boids secured by the mortgage.
We do not see that this agreement altered in any dgree or
added to the rights or obligations of the defendants in regard
to insurance on the premises. The agreement simply was that
if the defendants were bound to insure, then they would take
moneys arising from the insurance policies sufficient to pay the
bonds. Whether they were or, were not so liable was not determined or in any way intimated. If the court had then decided that they were liable, they would have had the opportunity,
of placing the necessary amount of insurance to cover the interest of the bondholders in addition to that which The Penn
Company then had covering its own interest, but no such decision was arrived at and no such order was made and no extra'
or other insurance taken out, and all parties seemed to be content to rest upon their legal rights and to take the risk of an
error as to what those rights were: To make a decree after a

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

loss has happened, by which the moneys arising from policies
covering only the interest of The Penn Company and procured
by it as security for such interest against the loss of property
by fire, requires the existence of an obligation on the part of
that company founded upon considerati6ns other than the fact
that it had opposed the appointment of a receiver, and that the
agreement had been made in the circumstances mentioned. In
our view there are no facts disclosed by this record which authorize or justify the court in regarding the defendants in the
same light as if they were receivers appointed upon the motion
made by complainant in this suit and as such had taken out
these policies. The court with all the facts before it refused to
appoint such receiver, and the fact that these defendants, Kann
and The Penn Company, successfully opposed the appointment,
furnishes no tenable ground to regard them as receivers because
of such successful opposition. This ground of liability must,
therefore, be rejected.
While it is true that as a consequence of this voluntary agreement entered into by Kann and Wertheimer, the latter was appointed a receiver to collect and hold a sufficient amount of
the insurance -moneys to pay these bonds, and in that way the
moneys may be described as being in court, yet the court did
not obtain jurisdiction to make any disposition of those moneys in behalf of complainant except upon the conditions made
in the agreement, by virtue of which alone the moneys came
under its immediate control. Unless the court held that there
was a liability, as expressed in the agreement, it obtained no
jurisdiction over these moneys to make a disposition of them
in accordance with general equitable principles. There is no
fund in court to be thus disposed of. We must confine ourselves, therefore, strictly to the question of whether there was

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 449
Opinion of the Court.

In this view, we must ask was there any obligation resting
upon these defendants to insure by reason of the contents of
the mortgage and of the deeds under which The Penn Company now claims title? In order to determine whether there
was an obligation of this nature it must first be decided there
was such obligation on the part of the mortgagor company,
because if that company was never under any obligation to insure, it is clear that the grantees subject to'the mortgage were
also free from any liability of that nature.
It is claimed that the mortgagor company became liable to
insure by reason of the provision in article tenth of the mortgage, or at least that it became thus liable to insure, when under that provision, it was required to do so by the mortgagee.'
That portion of the article directly in question here, after providing that it should be no part of the. duty of the trustee to do
certain things therein named, continued : "Nor shall it be any
part of its duty to effect insurance against fire or other damage on any portion of the mortgaged property, or to renew
any policies of insurance, or to keep itself informed or advised
as to the payment of any taxes or assessments, or to require
such payment to be made; but the trustee may in its discretion do any or all of the matters and things in this paragraph
set forth or require the same to be done."
It is argued that by this language a covenant arose on the
part of the mortgagor, by which it covenanted to insure the
property if required to do so by the mortgagee. Reading the
whole of that article with the other provisions of the mortgage,
we think there is great force in the reasoning of Judge Gray
in the Circuit Court of Appeals, by. which he concludes that
there was no original obligation imposed by the mortgage on
the mortgagor to insure for the benefit of the mortgagee. But
we do not ourselves decide that no such obligation existed.
The Court of Appeals did not place its determination upon that
ground alone, but after discussing it and coming to the conclusion which it did, it then proceeded to discuss the question
whether the defendant company was liable upon the assumption that there rested upon the mortgagor an original obligation imposed upon it by the mortgage to insure for the benefit

of the bondholders. We will make the same assumption, and
the inquiry then arises as to the obligation of the defendants
to themselves insure for the benefit of the bondholders after
they respectively became the owners of the equity of redemption in the premises.
Kann became the purchaser under a receiver's sale ordered
by the court and pursuant to its directions, and he received
from the officer conducting that sale a deed conveying to him
the premises subject to the mortgage of the complainant. He
thus occupies the position of a purchaser at a judicial sale which
was ordered to be made subject to the lien of an existing mortgage upon the premises to be sold, and he made no agreement
which in terms obligated him to pay a dollar of the mortgage
or to comply with a single one of the covenants of the mortgagor. Whatever his obligations may have been in regard to
the mortgage or to the covenants of the mortgagor arising from
the simple fact of his taking a deed subject to that mortgage,
the obligations of his grantee are no greater than his own. The
Penn Company took the title which he had subject to the same
mortgage as in his case, and with no promise on its part, in
terms, to pay the mortgage or to insure the premises for the
benefit of any other interest than its own.
Counsel for the complainant argue that the extent of the obligation of grantees or purchasers subject to a mortgage in
Pennsylvania has always been, at the least, that by taking
such a deed the grantee impliedly agrees to indemnify the
grantor against his liability on the mortgage. Many cases are
cited by the parties on both sides in relation to this question.
In -Moore's Apeal, 88 Penn. St. 450, decided in 1879, Chief
Justice Sharswood, delivering the opinion of the court, it was
held that such a clause was a covenant of indemnity only, as
between the grantor and the grantee for the protection of the
former. Or, in other words, it was held that on taking the
land the grantee will indemnify the grantor to the extent of
the mortgage, in the same manner as if the consideration had
been paid in cash and then applied by the mortgagor at the
time. It was also held that an agreement to pay the encumbrance might be implied from the circumstances of any particu

Opinion of the Court.

Jar case. In the course of his opinion the Chief Justice reviews
many prior cases in that State, and, in speaking of the words
"subject to the mortgage thereon," said:
"Why should a covenant be inferred from these words by
the vendee to the vendor to do more than protect the latter
from loss? If there is no existing personal liability in the vendor by reason of his bond or promise under which he can be
compelled to pay if the mortgaged premises prove insufficient,
what reason is there that he should exact a covenant from his
vendee for the benefit of a stranger? If such personal liability
does exist why should he exact anything more than indemnity?
Surely, then, something should appear to create the inference
of such a covenant. The words 'under and subject' import no'
such thing. They import that the vendee takes the land encumbered, and at most that so taking -it at an agreed consideration, which includes the encumbrance, he will indemnify the
vendor to the extent of that consideration, in the same manner
as if it had been paid in cash and so applied at the time. It is
unwise to give an arbitrary, artificial meaning to words commonly, used in contracts and conveyances, and thus entrap
parties into engagements into which they had no reason to
suppose, in the common use of language, they were entering.
The act of assembly of June 12, 1878, Pamph. L. 205, has very
wisely provided that the grantor shall not be personally liable
unless he shall expressly assume such liability by agreement in
writing, or condition in the conveyance."

the import of the clause "under and subject to the lien of" a
mortgage was under consideration, and it was held that an implied covenant to indemnify arose from that language. It was
also held that the vendor had no right of action against the
vendee in such a deed until he had been forced to pay the mortgage, either in whole or in part. This was also held in a case
between the same parties, reported in the same volume (171
Penn. St.) at page 339.
The act of June 12, 1878, of the Pennsylvania legislature,
(P. L. p. 205,) provides as follows:
"Grantees of real estate which is subject to ground rent or

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

bound by mortgage or other encumbrance shall not be personally liable for the payment of such ground rent, mortgage or
other encumbrance unless he shall, by an agreement in writing,
have expressly assumed a personal liability therefor, or there
shall be express words in the deed of conveyance stating that
the grant is made on condition of the grantee assuming such
personal liability therefor: _P'ovided, That the use of the
words ' under and subject to the payment of such ground rent,
mortgage or other encumbrance, shall not alone be construed
so as to make such grantee personally liable as aforesaid."
Under the various cases cited, and the statute above quoted,
we may assume that by the law of Pennsylvania the grantee
who simply takes a deed subject to the lien of a mortgage is at
most nothing more than an indemnitor of his grantor against
the payment of the mortgage or any part of it by such grantor.
There is no liability on the part of the grantee to the mortgagee so that the latter has any cause of action against him for
the payment of the mortgage. If the mortgagor be not liable
to pay at all there is no liability resting on the grantee to pay.
It then becomes necessary to determine what liability, if
any, rested upon the mortgagor. By reference to the fourth
article of the mortgage, already set forth in the statement of
facts, it will be seen that there is no personal liability on the
part of the mortgagor. There is no obligation, therefore, on
the part of The Penn Company to indemnify the mortgagor
company for any personal liability to pay the mortgage or any
part thereof, for no such liability exists. However much below the amount of the mortgage the land should sell for is, so
far as this question is concerned, a matter of no legal interest
to the mortgagor company, and the fact in no way creates any
liability on its part. As there was no liability on the part of
the mortgagor to pay any portion of the debt secured by the
mortgage, and the liability, if any, to indemnify the mortgagor
on its covenant to insure is, as stated by the judge delivering
the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, incidental and subordinate to its liability to indemnify the mortgagor regarding
the mortgage debt, no such liability to indemnify upon the insurance covenant would seem to rest upon the defendant com-

Opinion of the Court.

pany or upon Kann, because there is none such existing in relation to the mortgage debt itself.
The covenant to insure does not run with the land, so that
one taking a conveyance comes under a primary obligation to
insure, over and above that of a mere indemnitor. Columbia

But, assuming the law of Pennsylvania to be that there is
an obligation on the part of these defendants, by reason of
their taking the deeds subject to the mortgage, to indemnify
the mortgagor on its covenant to insure, contained in the mortgage, what is the extent and character of that obligation thus
assumed? The covenant on the part of the mortgagor, which
we assume exists. by reasoni of the language contained in the
mortgage, was a personal obligation -or covenant. The question then arises, what consequences would follow upon a breach
of the covenant by the mortgagor? Suppose it had not conveyed the property and still remained the owner and in possession, and yet refused or omitted to insure, as it had covenanted
to do in the mortgage, what remedy under this mortgage existed because of this violation by the mortgagor? The complainant might have taken out insurance and claimed reimbursement or added the premiums paid to the amount of the
mortgage debt. It did not do so. What other remedy it had
for a violation of any covenant by the mortgagor is stated in
the mortgage. It is therein expressly understood and agreed
between the parties "that no other suit or proceeding for the
collection of the bonds shall be commenced, except such suits
or proceedings as shall be necessary to recover the possession
of the premises mortgaged, or to subject the same to the payment of the debts, and that the sale of the mortgaged premises,
whether under the power of sale granted or any other power
of sale, or by or under any judicial proceeding whatsoever,
shall operate as a full and com plete Satisfaction and discharge
of the j.ndebtedness of the mortgage and of the obligation of the
covenants therein contained, whether the premises should be
bidden in for the whole amount of the indebtedness or for a
less price, anything in the bonds or coupons to the contrary

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

thereof notwithstanding." The sale of the mortgaged premises is by the specific terms of the mortgage to operate as satisfaction of all the covenants contained in the mortgage. And
in asking for the sale of the property, by the commencement
of this suit, complainant cannot add to the relief it is entitled
to by a sale, any other or different relief than that. By the
express provisions of the mortgage there was not only an exemption of personal liability for the payment of the bonds and
coupons, or any part of them, but there was also an exemption
of all personal liability on account of the obligation of any
other covenant contained in the mortgage; such exemption
covering not only the obligation to pay the debt, but also any
other covenant. Hence the obligation to indemnify the mortgagor on account of any failure lay it to insure does not exist,
because there is no liability on the part of the mortgagor to
answer for its breach of covenant in any other way than by
complainant taking possession of the premises, or by a foreclosure of the mortgage and sale thereunder. The mortgagor
having conveyed the premises, has no further interest in them,
and hence their sale under the mortgage would be no damage
to the mortgagor, and no case for indemnity to it would be
made out.
The alleged contractual obligation to indemnify, as well regarding the covenant to insure, as that regarding the payment
of the bonds and coupons, does not help the complainant in this
case, because of the affirmative provisions of the mortgage.
Whether the sale, under the foreclosure prayed for in this case,
has taken place or not, there is no other or personal liability of
the mortgagor to respond for its breach of covenant to insure
than that which it has provided for in the mortgage. If it be
under none other, then the indemnitor-has nothing to ideinnify.
In regard to the contractual obligationi to insure on the part
of defendants, which complainant avers exists as one of the
foundations for the equitable lien claimed by it, the judge, delivering the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 103 Fed.
Rep. 151, said:
"But, apart from cases of fraud, it is only when there is such

Opinion of the Court.

a contract or promise, which can be so bnforced, that courts of
equity will recognize for that purpose the existence of an equitable lien. In such case the lien is impressed upon funds or property which, belonging -to the promisor, were the very fuhds or
property which constituted the subject-matter of the contract
or to which the contract or promise related. It is essential,
therefore, that the funds or other property, which are to be
charged with the lien, should have, either at the time of the contract or afterwards, and while it was still unperformed, belonged
to the party against whom the contract is to be so enforced, and
be so identified, even though at the time of suit the said funds
or property have come into the hands of volunteers, or of others
who 'may be affedted with notice. There must, therefore, exist
a contract by the party owning; either in pr'sentior in expectancy, the property sought to-be charged, which directly or by
necessary implication, expresses the intention to charge such
property with the lien, in favor of the other party to the contract. .
.
It is not pretended that there was any contract
between Kann or the appellant company and the complainant
to insure for its benefit, or any promise or declaration of intention, upon any or no consideration, that they, or either of them,
would so insure, or that policies or funds arising therefrom should
be assigned or charged with a lien in its favor. The. first essential requisite to an equitable lien, as above described, is, therefore, entirely wanting. There is no contractual relation of any
kind between the mortgagee and the appellant," (respondent in
this court) "in whose name, and for whose sole benefit, these
policies of insurance were taken out. If such a lien, therefore,
exists on these insurance funds, in favor of the complainant, it
must be on other grounds than these ordinary and well-understood ones. This is not the case of a mortgagee claiming an
insurance taken out by the mortgagor, who had covenanted to
insure for the benefit of the mortgagee; nor is it the case of
such mortgagee claiming such insurance funds, when they had
come into the hands of third persons, ' who are either volunteers,
or who take the estate. [the insurance funds] on which the lien
is agreed to be given with notice of the stipulation.' The con-.
plainant does not claim that the funds due on policies taken out

by the mortgagor, and which the mortgagor is held to have
promised that he would assign to the mortgagee, have come
into the possession of the appellant (respondent), with notice,
and are, therefore, charged with a lien in favor of the mortgagee. Its claim is that the grantee of the equity of redemption, having taken the property expressly subject to the mortgage, which contained a covenant on the part of the mortgagor
to insure, on that ground alone came either under a direct obligation to-insure the premises for the benefit of the.mortgagee,
or under an obligation to indemnify the mortgagor for his lia'bility under said covenant. But the property or ' estate' which
came to the hands of the appellant, as grantee of the equity of
redemptiob, was the mortgaged premises, subject to the mortgage. There is no difficulty in determining what that estate is
to be charged 'irith. The court here, however, is asked to impress a lien in favor of the mortgagee, not on this estate, but
upon funds which were never in any sense the property of the
mortgagor, and could never have -been the subject-matter of a
promise on its part. It is the first branch of the claim above
stated (i. e., the alleged direct Gbligation) that we are now considering."
We fail to see any contractual obligation on the part of the
defendants to insure for the benefit of the bondholders further
than we have stated, as indemnitors of the mortgagor for its
breach, if any, of its covenants.
The case of Wheeler v. Insurance Company, 101 U. S. 439,
isfounded upon the existence of the obligation of the mortgagor
to insure, and it is said that under such circumstances the mortgagee will have an equitable lien upon the money due upon a
policy of insurance taken out by the mortgagor to the extent of
the mortgagee's interest in the property destroyed, and that
such equitable lien exists, although the contract provided that
in case of the mortgagor's failure to procure and assign that
insurance, the mortgagee might procure it at the mortgagor's
expense.
If the insurance had been taken out by this mortgagor company, even in its own name, we would have the same principle
as. decided in the last cited case, and- the complainant herein

FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 457
Opinion of the Cour t.

might, as its counsel claim, have had an equitable lien upon the
moneys arising from such insurance to the extent of the loss
under the mortgage. But here is no such case. The mortgagor
did not insure after it lost title to the property' under the conveyance by its receiver to Kann, and the insurance that was procured was for the interest of the defendants in the property to
the exclusion, in terms, of the interest of the complainant. Although the defendant bought subject to the mortgage and with
full knowledge of the insurance covenant, yet it held the property subject only to an obligation on its part, at most, to indemnify the mortgagor on account of the mortgage debt or on
account of its covenant to insure, and we have seen that that
obligation, under the terms of this mortgage, was of no materiality because by its terms the mortgagor was under no personal liability, and there was, therefore, no subject upon which
indemnity could rest.
If there is no contractual obligation arising from the terms
of the mortgage, and the taking of the deeds with an "under
and subject" clause, as above referred to then there must have
been some conduct on the part of the person to be, charged
which would estop him from setting up as a defence the lack of
such obligation. The complainant urges that the defendants
have been guilty of conduct which does estop them from denying their, liability. This is a different claim from that first remarked upon as to the treatment of defendants as receivers.
This claim is based upon a survey-of the whole conduct of defendants in' connection with the mortgagor company and the
insurance upon the property. The record in-this case, in our
opinion, discloses no conduct on the part of the defendants
which esto.ps them or either of them from showing the lack of
any obligation on their part to apply any portion of the insurance moneys to the payment of the bondholders. There has
been no wrecking of the mortgagor company by either or both
defendants, and neither has done anything depriving himself
or itself of any defence he or it might otherwise. have. In other
words, both defendants have, so far as this record shows, full libefty to set up as a defence the wantof any contractual or other
obligation to insure. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Ap-

no necessity in ourselves going over this particular ground.
After a careful consideration of the whole case, we are of

LANDER v. MERCANTILE BANK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 227. Argued April 18, 1902.-Decided June 2, 1902.

This suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern Division of Ohio, Eastern District, to restrain the collection of
certain taxes levied by the officers of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, upon the
appellee bank. The grounds of the suit were that the acts of the taxing officers of said county were in violation of the " rights of th plaintiff
(appellee) and of its shareholders accorded to them by section 5219 of
the Revised Statutes of the United States, securing to said shareholders
a restriction of the rate and limit of taxes assessed upon their said shares
to that assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands-of individual
citizens of the State of Ohio." The bill alleged that the plaintiff (appellee) was a national bank, and stated the capital stock of the bank and the
number of shares into which it was divided; that its cashier made the
proper returns of the resources and liabilities of the bank to the county
auditor; that the latter fixed the value thereof, as required by section 27 6
of the Revised Statutes of the State, after deducting the assessed value
of the real estate of the bank, and transmitted a statement of his action,
and a copy of the report made by the cashier, to the state board of eqalization, for incorporated banks and that board, professing to act under
sections 2808 and 2809 of the Revisel Statut'es of the State, increased the
valuation of the shares without notice to the bank or to its shareholders,
and that the board was hence without jurisdiction to make such increase,
and "its action in respect thereto was void and of no effect." It was
averred ".that said state board of equalization knowingly and designedly
did fix a much higher per centum of valuation and assessment for taxation upon the shares of the plaintiff's capital stock than was assessed
