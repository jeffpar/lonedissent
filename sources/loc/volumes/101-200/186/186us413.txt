HOTEMA v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 572. Submitted April 28,1902.-Decided June 2,1902.
In relation to the part of this charge, in which the, court speaks of an irresistible impulse to commit the murder, counsel for the defendant says
that he made no claim that the defendant was actiated by an'irresistible impulse, and that there is nothing in the evidence to show that he
was; that what he did claim was that the defendant was laboring under
an insane delusion; and that, this charge did not bring that subject before the jury. As there is no portion of the evidence returned in the bill
of exceptions, this court is unable to judge whether there was any which
would justify, or which did justify the court in submitting the question
that
of irresistible impulse to the jury. If there had been evidence on

Upon the other portion of the charge, as to the general liability of the defendant to th. criminal law and to the obligation of the government to
prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt upon taking into consideration all the evidence, and in regard to every essential element of the
crime, the charge of the court was undoubtedly correct.
Taking the whole charge together the court properly laid ddwn the law in
regard to the responsibility of the defendant on account of his alleged

mental condition.

JUSTICE PRrC

Am

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error was indicted for the murder of Vina
Coleman on April 14, 1899, in the Indian Territory. He is an
Indian of the Choctaw tribe of Indians, and after having pleaded
not guilty to the indictment the venue was changed upon motion, and the cause was sent for trial to the United States District Court holden at Paris in the Eastern District of Texas.
Upon the trial before that court the defendant set up the defence of insanity, the jury found him guilty of murder as charged
in the indictment, and he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of
death. The defendant in the indictment has brought the case
here to revicw that judgment. There is no part of the evidence
contained in the bill of exceptions.
The errors which are assigned in this case relate to those contained in the charge of the court to the jury. The first one
we notice is an exception to a statement contained in the charge
of the court that: "In this case it is not material, so far as the
question of the guilt or innocence is -concerned, that the evidence fails to show any motive for the killing." The defendant claims that this is error, because the want of motive is
material, and the jury should 'onsider that fact in determining
the issue as to defendant's sanity at the time of the homicide.
The exception to this single remark of the court fails to give
the proper view of the charge, and gives a false impression as
to the meaning of the court therein. The attention of the
court was directed to the subject of proving motive upon the
trial of a person charged with murder, and he charged that it
was unnecessary to show a motive for the commission of the
crime so long as the evidence satisfied the jury that the person
charged was in fact guilty of the act; that it was not necessary
to prove by any particular-expression of the -party charged that
he had some personal or what may be termed express malice
toward the individual who was killed. The court charged as
follows upon this subject:
"ifMurder-is where aperson of sound memory and discretion
unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, and in the
peace-of -the United States, with malice aforethought, either

HOTEMA v. UNITED STATES.

Â°.415

Opinion of the Court.

express or implied. The term express malice means that the
homicide was the result of a formed design, based upon a wicked
and depraved spirit, and is maliciously conceived and wickedly
and maliciously executed without justifiable or lawful excuse.
The most usual illustrations, and the ones best understood generally -of the term ' express malice,' are such as lying in wait
for the intended victim, and when he approaches he is slain, or
the preparation and administration of poison for the purpose
of taking life, because in such instances the acts clearly show
the formed design and the unlawful intent and its execution,
and therefore is said to be killing upon express malice. These
are only illustrations of what is meant by the terms ' express
malice,' and any homicide that is shown to have been the result
.of wilful intent and committed without legal excuse is said to
be a killing upon express malice.
"By the term 'implied malice' is meant that in the case
charged the evidence shows that the party charged committed
the act, and that it was intentional and unlawful,/that is, without justifiable excuse, and the evidence fails to reveal the motive
why the person committed the act. In that state of case the
law attaches or implies malice to the nature of the act done;
that is, the taking of human life without justifiable excuse.
Where the evidence fails to show that it was done upon.express
malice, yet it shows that the party charged intentionally did
the act without lawful excuse, malice is inferred, although the
evidence may not disclose any motive whatever, and therefore
if the killing was intentional and without justifiable excuse,
although no motive is shown for it, the party would be guilty
of murder and should be convicted therefor, unless excused
upon the ground of insanity or the want of mental capacity to
form a criminal intent. Therefore in this case it is not material,
so far as the question of guilt or'innocence is concerned, that
the evidence fails to show any motive for the killing, because
if the killing was intentional and was not justifiable, the law
implies the criminal intent, and, unless rebutted by testimony,
would justify a conviction, provided the evidence shows that
the party charged had sufficient mental ability to be held responsible for his acts."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

The expression in the charge which plaintiff excepted to,
when read in connection with all that the court said upon the
question, is undoubtedly correct.
Prior to giving specific instructions in regard to the legal
meaning of the word "insanity,' and as to its sufficiency as a
defence to the party accused of crime, the court made some
general statements upon that subject, as follows:
"Every person, charged with crime, is presumed to be sane;
that is, of sound memory and discretion, until the contrary is
shown by proof. No act done in a state of insanity can be
punished as an offence. The question of the insanity of the
defendant has exclusive reference to the act with which he is
charged and the time-of the commission of the same. If he
was sane at the time of the commission of the act, he is punishable by law. If he was insane at the time of the commission
of the act, he is entitled to be acquitted. A safe and reasonable test is that whenever it shall appear from all the evidence
that at the time of committing the act the defendant was sane,
and this conclusion is, proven to the satisfaction of the juf'y,
taking into consideration all the evidence in the case, beyond
a reasonable doubt, he will be held amenable to the law.
Whether the insanity be general or partial, whether continuous
or periodical, the degree of it must have been sufficiently great
to have controlled the will of the accused at the time of the
commission of the act. Where reason ceases to have dominion
over the mind proven to be diseased, the person reaches a degree of insanity where criminal responsibility ceases and accountability to the law for the purpose of punishment no longer
exists."
The court also charged:
"That the burden is upon the government throughout the
entire caseto prove every essential element of the case charged,
and if you should have a reasonable doubt, taking into consideration all the evidence in this case,- that the defendant Hotema was sane at the time of the commission of the act charged,
you will acquit him.

.

.

The real test, as I understand it,

of liability or nonliability rests upon the proposition whether
at the time the homicide was committed ITotema had a diseased

HOTEMA v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

brain, and it was not partially diseased or to some extent diseased, but diseased to the extent that he was incapable of forming a criminal intent, and that the disease had so taken charge
of his brain and had so impelled it that for the time being his
will power, judgment, reflection and control of his mental faculties were impaired so that the act done was an irresistible
and uncontrollable impulse with him at the time he committed
the act. If his brain was in this condition, he cannot be punished by law. But if his brain was not in this condition, he can
be punished by law, remembering that the burden is upon the
government to establish that he was of sound mind, and by
that term is not meant that he was of perfectly sound mind, but
that he had sufficient mind to know right from wrong, and'
knowing that the act he was committing at the time he was
performing it was a wrongful act in violation of human law,
and he could be punished therefor, and that he did not perform
the act because he was controlled by irresistible and uncontrollable impulse. In that state of case the defendant could
not be excused upon the ground of insanity, and it would be
your duty to convict him. But if you find from the evidence
or have a reasonable doubt in regard thereto, that his brain at
the time he committed the act was impaired by disease, and the
homicide was the product of such disease, and that he was incapable of forming a criminal intent, and that he had no control of his mental faculties and the will power to control his
actions, but simply slew Vina Coleman because he was laboring
under a; delusion which absolutely contr.olled him, and, that his
act was one of irresistible impulse and not of judgment, in that
event he would be entitled to an acquittal."
In relation to the latter part of this charge, in which the
court speaks of an irresistible impulse to commit the murder,
counsel for the defendant says that he made no claim that the
defendant was actuated by an irresistible impulse, and that there
is nothing in the evidence to show that he was; that what he
did claim was that the defendant was laboring under an insane
delusion, and that this charge did not bring that subject before
the jury. As there is no portion of the evidence returned in
the bill of exceptions, we are nnable to judge whether there was.

any which would justify, or which did justify the court in submitting the question of irresistible impulse to the jury. If
there had been evidence on that subject, the submission of the
question was certainly as fair to the defendant as he could ask.
'Wedecide nothing further than that.
Upon the other portion of the charge, as to the general liability
of the defendant to the criminal law and to the obligation of the
government to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
upon taking into consideration all the evidence, and in regard
to every essential elemeht of the crime, the charge of the court
was undoubtedly correct. Davisv. United States, 160 U. S. 469
Some evidence was given, as is stated by the court in its
charge, in regard to the defendant's drinking whiskey about
the time the homicide is said to have been committed. As to
his alleged irresponsibility, the court charged:
"Upon this matter you are instructed that the recent use of
whiskey would not be a defence in this case, and you are to
take the evidence as a whole, not by piecemeal, but all the evidence introduced in this case upon both sides, and it is legitimate for you to consider the evidence above referred to i
determining the question of whether or not iTotema was insane
at the time the homicide was committed, or whether he was
impelled and caused, to perform the act by reason of the liquor
he had drunk, if any. What I intend for you to understand is
this: If the evidence as a whole fails to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hotema was of sound brain, or at least to that
extent that he knew right from wrong, and was capable of
forming and carrying into execution a criminal intent, he would
be entitled to be acquitted, no matter what amount of whiskey
he had druiik; but, in arriving at that conclusion, the jury are
to look to all the evidence, and if, from . all the evidence, they
are satisfied that he slew Vina Coleman by reason of the whiskey
he had drunk, and not as a result of an insane delusion above
referred to, in that event it would be your duty to convict the
defendant; but if you have a reasonable doubt with regard to
this matter, you will resolve it in favor of the defendant and
acquit him."
We can see no cause for fault finding with that portion of

HOTEMA v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the charge on the part of the defendant. The court had already
charged there must be a wilful and intentional killirig in order
to warrant a conviction of murder. If that were present, we
have no doubt the fact that defendant had drank some whiskey
before the killing was unimportant.
Then in regard to the subject of delusion the court charged:
"There is evidence in this case tending to show that Hotema
believed in witches, and that that was taught by the Bible, and
had the belief that his people and tribe were being affected by
witches, and that the deaths that were occurring in the neighborhood were due to the evil influence of witches, and that the
party he slew was a witch. Upon this phase of the case you
are instructed that if the evidence shows that the defendant
Hotema believed in witches, and that it was the result of his
investigation and, belief as to what the Scriptures taught, and
that he. acted upon that belief, thinking he had the right to kill
the party he is charged with killing, because he thought she was
a witch, but at the time he knew it was a violation of human law
and he would be punished therefor, in that event it would not
be an insane delusion upon the part of Hotema, but would be
an erroneous conclusion, and, being so, would not excuse him
from the consequences of his act. And, also, if you further
believe that he came to the conclusion from his investigation
and understanding of the Scriptures that this party was a witch,
and that the defendant also used spirituous liquors, and these
two combined were the cause or causes that led him to the conimission of the act, and that either or both of these were the
sole inducement that caused him to do the act, he would not be
guiltless and would be responsible therefor. Upon the other
hand, I charge you that if you should find from the evidence
in this case that Solomon Hotema, the defendant, believed that
there were witches, and that he had a right to kill them, and if
you further find that such belief was the product of a diseased
brain, or if you have a reasonable doubt that such condition of
brain existed at the time of the homicide, and that his act was
the result of such diseased brain, you will acquit him.
"In this case you are to determine the following questions:
"1st. Was the defendant Hotema at the time he committed

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

the homicide charged laboring under an insane delusion produced by an impaired brain, and did it go to the extent for the
time being of controlling his will power, reflection, reason and
judgment, and was the homicide committed by reason of such
insane delusion? If the proof has shown beyond a reasonable
doubt that such was not the case, you will convict the defendant, but if there is a reasonable doubt as to such mental condition, you will resolve such doubt in favor of the defendant and
acquit him.
"2d. Did Hotema commit the homicide, not laboring under
an insane delusion, but believing that by teachings of the Bible
he had right to kill the party he did kill because he thought she
was a witch, and at the time of such killing he performed the
same solely upon such belief, and was not laboring under an insane delusion ? If you believe this state of case existed, and so
believe it beyond a reasonable doubt, you will find the defendant guilty as charged in this indictment, but if you have a reasonable doubt in regard thereto, you will acquit the defendant."
The court had already properly instructed the jury as to the
test to be applied to the general defence of insatity. In substance it bad charged the jury that if defendant knew the nature and quality of his act when he committed it, and that it
was wrong and a violation of the law of the land, for which he
would be punished, that he was responsible for the act he committed. And upon the matter of irresistible impulse, the charge
was, as we have said, at least as favorable to the defendant as
he had any right to ask.
We think, taking the whole charge together, that the judge
properly laid down the law in regard to the responsibility of
the defendant on account of his alleged mental condition. It
placed the burden on the government (following -Davis v.
United States, sup.ra), of proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant was sane at the time of the commission of
the act, as one of the essential features of the crime. It also
held that within the legal definition of insanity the defendant
was responsible for his acts if at the time of their commission
he was of sufficient mental capacity to understand their nature
and quality, and that the particular act in question was wrong

HOTEMA v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

and a violation of the law of the land for which he would be
amenable to punishment under that law.
Upon the condition of mind of defendant regarding witches,
the court held that if his belief in witches and his right to kill
them were the product of a diseased brain, he was irresponsible, and if the jury had a reasonable doubt on that question,
it should acquit. If his belief were not the product of an insane delusion but simply an erroneous conclusion of a sane
mind, he was, as the court charged, responsible.
The court, by the portions of the charge above adverted to,
directed the attention of the jury to the distinction between a
mere erroneous opinion and an insane delusion, the product of
a diseased mind or brain. The subject is somewhat difficult'
and the line of distinction not always easily drawn, but it exists, and we think'that in this case the condition of mind which
would render the defendant irresponsible was sufficiently and
properly indicated by the court in its charge. It assumed that
defendant might have formed an erroneous opinion regarding
witches and witchcraft, and yet might not have been insane
within the legal definition, and therefore, although possessing
such erroneous ideas and acting on them, he might still. be responsible criminally for his actions. And on the other hand,
if his opinion on the subject were the result of insane delusions,
and he acted on them, he was irresponsible, and responsibility
must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We think this
was all the defendant could require.
A special plea to the indictment in this case was filed by the
defendant, setting up the fact that he had been once placed in
jeopardy, and it appeared in the plea that the defendant on the
same day on which he killed Vina Coleman also killed two
other persons, and two indictments were found charging defendant with the murder of each of such persons, the indictments were thereupon consolidated and upon his trial on the
consolidated indictments the defence. set\up was insanity, the
same ground as set up in this case, and it was alleged that the
only issue made in the case was whether the defendant was
sane or insane at the time that he killed the two persons. The
jury upon the trial of defendant on the consolidated indictments

422

Opinion of the Court.

for the murder of the two found him not guilty, on the issue of
insanity. The indictment in this case was for the killing by
the defendant of the third of the three persons, and it is upon
these facts that he sets up the plea of once in jeopardy.
While the plea, on such facts, is wholly without merit, and
need not be'further noticed, it is only adverted to for the purpose of recognizing the fact that the defendant has been charged
with the murder of, three different persons on the same day,
and that seemingly there was no motive shown for the killing
of any of them, or, at any rate, there was none shown for the
killing of the person described in the indictment in this case,
as the charge of the court in substance concedes. It also appears in this record that the first jury impanelled in this case
was unable to agree upon a verdict. We are thus made acquainted, from the record, with the fact that one jury, upon
the question of the insanity of the defendant, has upon the trial
of the consolidated indictments charging him with two distinct
and separate murders, acquitted him of the alleged crimes on
that ground; another jury has been unable in this case to agree
upon the question; a third one has, in the case now before us,
convicted him. Being unable to see any legal error committed
by the trial court we are bound to affirm the judgment. The
*question whether, upon a consideration of the facts, the extreme
penalty of the law should be carried out upon this defendant,
is one which must be addressed to the consideration of the executive, as it is not one oier which this court has jurisdiction.
The judgment must be
Afflrmed.
