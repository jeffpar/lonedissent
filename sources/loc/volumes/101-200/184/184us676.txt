OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 121.

Argued January 20, 1902.-Decided March 24, 1902.

This suit was upon a bond taken by a Circuit Court of the United States
from its clerk, to secure the proper performance of his duties, and the
Circuit Court could take cognizance of it, independently of the citizenship of the real parties in interest, as it was a suit arising under the laws
of the United States, of which the Circuit Court was entitled to take original cognizance, concurrently with the courts of the State, even if the
parties had been citizens of the same State; and, although the petition
shows a case of diverse citizenship, jurisdiction was not dependent upon
such citizenship.
That the clerk of the court was authorized, with the sanction or by order of
the court, to receive money paid into court in a pending cause, is clearly
to be implied from the legislation of Congress referred to in the opinion
of the court.
Congress, by the statutes referred to in the opinion of the court, intended
the bond of a clerk of a Circuit Court should be for the protection of all
suitors, public or private.
As the clerk had the right to receive the money in question; as he failed,
to the injury of the suitor from whom he received it, with the sanction
of the court in a pending cause, to deposit it as required by law, and appropriated it to his own use; and as his bond was for the protection of
private suitors as well as for the Government, there is no sound reason
why the plaintiff could not enforce his rights by a suit in the name of the
United States for his benefit.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.

Opinion of the Court.

from the Circuit Court of Appeals? Has a clerk of a Circuit
Court of the United States authority to receive money brought
into court by a private suitor, and is he responsible upon his
bond if he does not deposit it as required by statute and appropriates it to his own use? Is the bond of the clerk for the protection of private suitors as well as of the United States ? Has
a private suitor the right without express statutory authority
to sue on the bond of the clerk in the name of the United States
for his benefit?
These questions are presented by the record, and will be examined after we shall have stated the facts set out in the special
findings made by the Circuit Court.
On the 3d day of March, 1887, Warren Watson was duly appointed clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Western Division of the Western District of Missouri; and on
the same day he executed and the court approved his bond to
the United States in the penalty of twenty thousand dollars.
He died March 24, 1892, while acting as clerk, and an administrator of his estate was appointed April 2, 1892. Notices, as
required by the local law, having been previously given for the
presentation of claims, the administration of the estate was
closed and the administrator discharged on the 11th day of
September, 1894. At no time did the United States or the relator Stewart exhibit or present any claim against Watson's estate.
Stewart instituted, February 6, 1891, in the Circuit Court of
the United States a suit at law against Henry County, IMissouri, upon three bonds of the county, two for $1000 each and
one for $500. His petition contained three counts. In the first
count he asked for judgment for $1010 with interest from September 1, 1887, as the amount due on the first bond of $1000.
The second count was upon the other bond for $1000; the third,
upon the $500 bond.
On the 3d day of March, 1891, the county filed its answer alleging as to the first count that on September 6 [1], 1887, there
was due on the bond therein referred to $1010, and on that
date it had deposited that sum in the National Bank of Commerce of New York for the payment of the bond and interest,

OCTOE3R TERMN,

Opinion of the Court.

and tendered the same to the plaintiff as full payment thereof,
but that the plaintiff had refused to accept such payment. The
answer further alleged that the defendant had "at all times
been ready and willing to pay plaintiff said sum of $1010 in full
payment of said bond and unpaid interest, and now here again
tenders to plaintiff said sum of $1010 in full payment of said
bond and unpaid interest due thereon, on September 6, [1],
1887, and now brings the said sum into court." The answer to
the second and third counts was exactly the same, except that
as to the third count the amount named was $505 instead of

$1010.
On the same day, March 3, 1891, there was entered on the
records of the court in said cause the following order: "This
day comes defendant by its attorney and files answer and tenders to the plaintiff and deposits with the clerk the sum of $2525
in payment and satisfaction of his cause of action in the petition
set forth. Thereupon a stipulation waiving a trial by jury is
filed herein."
It was found as a fact that Henry County did hand to Watson the sum of $2525 as recited in that order.
On June 27, 1891, Stewart, the plaintiff in that suit, filed
a reply, which was a general denial of the facts alleged in the
answer.
On July 2, 1894, more than two years after Watson's death,
there was entered on the records of the court in the cause the
following: "This day come the parties by their attorneys, the
plaintiff by Karnes, Holmes & Krautboff, and the defendant by
M. A. Fyke, and a stipulation waiving a jury having been heretofore filed herein, the hearing of this cause is proceeded with
before the court. Thereupon evidence is heard and the case is
submitted to the court and by the court taken under advisement
with leave to the parties to file briefs."
On the 11th day of February, 1895, the following order was
made in that case: "A jury having heretofore been waived in
writing by the parties hereto, and this cause having been submitted to the court on the pleadings and evidence and argument of counsel, and taken under advisement by the court, and
the court being now fully advised in the premises, doth find the

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

issues as follows, to wit: On the first count of the petition the
court finds that the principal and interest. on bond No. 20d: was
duly tendered by defendant at the place of payment on the first
day of September, 1887, and that after the plaintiff instituted
this action in this court, and at the filing of the answer herein,
the defendant duly paid said sum into court for the use and benefit of plaintiff, and that plaintiff is entitled to judgment therefor on the first count of the petition in the sum of $1010." The
findings on the other counts differed only as to amounts.
The order in the same case then proceeded: "It is therefore
ordered and adjudged by the court that the plaintiff have judgment for the recovery of the sum of twenty-five hundred and
twenty-five dollars ($2525), the aggregate amount found to be
owing to him under the three counts of the petition, and that
plaintiff pay the costs of this action and that execution issue
therefor. And it further appearing to the court that the said
sum of $2525, so paid into court as aforesaid, was paid to and
received by Warren Watson, the then clerk of this court, who has
since departed this life without having accounted for said sum
of money so received by him as said clerk, and that said money
has never been turned over to his successor in office, the present
clerk of this court, nor has the same been otherwise accounted
for by said Warren Watson as clerk, or otherwise: It is found
and adjudged by the court that the plaintiff is entitled to have
and recover said money so received by said Warren Watson as
clerk aforesaid, and plaintiff is authorized to proceed therefor
on the bond of said Warren Watson given as clerk as aforesaid."
No appeal was taken from this judgment, and the same became final and remained in full force and effect and unpaid.
No order or direction as to this money was ever made except
as indicated in the order of February 11, 1895.
When the $2525 was paid by Henry County to Watson, he
deposited it the same day in a bank to kis individual credit,
and it was not at any time treated by him as in the depository
of the court. He never presented to the court any account of
the money, nor paid it either to Henry County or to Stewart.
During the pendency of the Stewart suit against the county

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

neither party took any steps for an order in relation to the
money, other than was actually made as above stated, nor made
any objection to the method in which the money was received.
Stewart, however, had no knowledge of the acts of Watson.
It was further found that no demand was ever made on the
defendants or on Watson for the money other than is to be
inferred from the institution of the suit.
The present action was brought October 19, 1895, against the
sureties in Watson's bond, in the name of the United States, at
the relation and to the use of David D. Stewart. One of the
sureties, McDonald, pleaded his discharge in bankruptcy, and
that plea was sustained. Judgment was entered against the
sureties (except McDonald) for the sum of $2525 with interest
at six per cent from the commencement of this suit, making
total of $3057.77. 93 Fed. Rep. 719. That judgment was
affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 102 Fed. Rep. T7.
1. The first question is one of the jurisdiction of this court.
The defendant in error insists that the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals was final, and that therefore no writ of error
lay to this court.
Is this a correct interpretation of the statutes defining and
regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States?
In all cases in which the judgments of a Circuit Court of Appeals are not made final by the act of March 3, 1891, c. 511,
there is of right an appeal or writ of error to this court where
the matter in controversy exceeds one thousand dollars in value
besides costs. 26 Stat. 826, 828.
Among the cases in which the judgments or decrees of the
Circuit Courts of Appeals are made final are those in which the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court "is dependent entirely upon
the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being aliens and
citizens of the United States or citizens of different States." 26
Stat. 828, § 6.
The opposite parties here are Stewart, the relator, a citizen
of Maine, for whose benefit the suit was brought, and the sureties on the bond of Watson, who are all citizens of Missouri.
The Government is the nominal, while Stewart is the real,
plaintiff. His citizenship is to be regarded in any inquiry as to

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

jurisdiction. Browne v. Strode, 5 Cranch, 803; McNutt v.
Bland, 2 How. 9; Za'rylandv. Baldwin, 112 U. S. 490.
But does it not appear from the petition itself that the case
was one of which the Circuit Court could take cognizance independently of the citizenship of the real parties in interest?
This question must receive an affirmative answer. The suit
was directly upon a bond taken by the Circuit Court in conformity with the statutes of the United States, and the case
depends upon the scope and effect of that bond and the meaning of those statutes. It was therefore a suit arising under the
laws of the United States, of which the Circuit Court (concurrently with the courts of the State) was entitled to take original
cognizance, even if the parties had been citizens of the same
State. Act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 431, c. 866. This court
has heretofore decided that a suit upon a bond of a marshal of
the United States was one arising under the laws of the United
States. Feielman v. Packar'd,109 U. S.421, 423; Backrack
v. N rton, 132 U. S. 337; Reagan v. Aiken, 138 U. S.109;
Book v. Perkins, 139 U. S.628, 630. The same principle must
be held to be applicable to suits upon the bond of a clerk of a
court of the United States. It could not be that a suit upon
the bond of a marshal was one arising under the laws of the
United States, and that a suit upon the bond of a clerk of a
court of the United States was not of that class.
It results that although the petition shows a case of diverse
citizenship, jurisdiction was not dependent entirely upon such
citizenship. Jurisdiction was likewise invoked, and rightfully,
upon Federal grounds. And as the case was one which could
not have been brought here directly from the Circuit Court,
the final judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals could be reviewed in this court upon writ of error sued out by the defendants.
2. We now come to the merits of the case. The bond in suit
was taken under the authority of section 795 of the Revised
Statutes as amended by the act of February 22, 1875, c. 95, 18
Stat. 333. That section reads: "§ 795. The clerk of every court
shall give bond, in a sum to be fixed and with sureties to be
approved by the court which appoints him, faithfully to dis-

OCTOBER1 TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

charge the duties of his office, and seasonably to record the decrees, judgments and determinations of the court of which he
is clerk; and a new bond may be required whenever the court
deems it proper that such bond should be given. A copy of
every bond given by a clerk shall be entered on the journal of
the court for which he is appointed, and the bond shall be deposited for safekeeping as the court may direct. A certified
copy of such entry shall be _prima facie proof of the execution
of such bond and of the contents thereof."
The conditions of the bond, as set forth in this section, were
the same as those prescribed by the Judiciary Act of 1789. 1
Stat. 73, 76.
It will be observed that section 795 does not naine the obligee
in the bond, and leaves its amount to be fixed by the court.
But the third section of the act of 1875 provided, as did the
Judiciary Act of 1789, that the clerks should give bond to the
United States. The act of 1875 also required bond "in the sum
of not less than five nor more than twenty thousand dollars, to
be determined and regulated by the Attorney General of the
United States." And the same act authorized the Attorney
General to require a bond in a sum not to exceed forty thousand
dollars whenever the business of the court should make it necessary.
It must be taken as indisputable that the money in question
was paid by Henry County in satisfaction of Stewart's claim
or cause of action. It must also be taken as indisputable,
upon this record, that the deposit was made with Watson as
clerk in the presence and with the assent of the court, although
no order was entered expressly requiring the money to be paid
to the clerk or expressly directing him to receive it. But all
this is necessarily to be implied from the terms of the order of
March 3, 1891, which states that Henry County-presumably
in the presence of the court-depositedthe money with the clerk.
It would be a very narrow interpretation of the words of that
order to hold that the money was paid to Watson without the
knowledge, approval or sanction of the court, or that it was paid
to him as an individual and not in his capacity as clerk. The

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

order was equivalent to one expressly stating that the money
was paid by direction of the court to Watson as clerk.
But it is suggested that in the absence of a statute distinctly
so providing, the clerk was not entitled to receive the money
deposited in payment and satisfaction of Stewart's claim. It is
true that no statute declares in words that a clerk may receive
money brought into court for the purposes of a pending suit.
But it is clear that Henry County was entitled to bring into court
and tender to its adversary the amount it was willing to pay in
satisfaction of his claim. It cannot be that it was the duty of
the judge of the court himself to have received the money and
personally deposited it as required by law. No one has ever
supposed that a judge was under obligation to perform such
services. Who, then, was to receive the money? Plainly it
was the duty of the clerk, who was the arm of the court, kept
its records showing money paid in by suitors or officers, and was
under bond conditioned that he would faithfully perform all the
duties of his office. He was allowed by statute a commission
"for receiving, keeping and paying out money in pursuance of
any statute or order of court." Rev. Stat. § 828. It was well
said by Judge Caldwell, delivering the unanimous judgment of
the Circuit Court of Appeals, that "for more than a century
the clerks of the Circuit Courts of the United States have been
receiving and paying out the moneys of suitors in those courts
in the usual and ordinary manner, and during that time neither
the clerks nor the suitors nor the court ever dreamed that they
were performing this service as private individuals, and were
not officially responsible .for the moneys they were receiving as
such clerks."
That the clerk was authorized, with the sanction or by order
of court, to receive money paid into court in a pending cause,
is clearly to be implied from the legislation of Congress. It
will be well to trace the history of this question through the
statutes enacted from time to time.
By the act of March 1, 1793, c. 20, clerks of District Courts
were allowed one and a quarter per cent commission on "all
money deposited in court." 1 Stat. 332-3; 1 Stat. 625, c. 19, § 3.
Money received by a marshal in a prize cause was held by

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Justice Story to be properly paid over to the clerk, and
that he was entitled to commissions under the statute. That
practice, he held, was of great importance for the "security of
suitors." Thie Avery, (1814), 2 Gall. 308, 311. See also Blake
v. Hawkins, 19 Fed. Rep. 204; Znn ie Good'ich, 4 Dill. 230;
Smith v. Aforgan City, 39 Fed. Rep. 572. In -agan v. Cullen,
28 Fed. Rep. 843, 844, Mr. Justice Brown held that moneys
received by the marshal should, under sections 995 and 996 of
the Revised Statutes, either be immediately deposited by him
"orpaid to the clerk and by him deposited."
By an act approved April 18, 1814, c. 62, it was provided
that upon the payment of money into a District or Circuit
Court to abide the order of the court, the same should be deposited in an incorporated bank to be designated by the court,
there to remain until it was decided to whom it of right belonged. If there was no such bank, then the court could "direct" the money to be deposited according to its discretion. 3
Stat. 127. Could not such direction have been given to the
clerk ?
The act of 1814 was supplemented by one approved March 3,
1817, c. 108, making it the duty of Circuit and District Courts
"to cause and direct" all moneys remaining in such courts, and
all moneys subject to their order, to be deposited in a branch
of the Bank of the United States in the name and to the credit
of the court. § 1. The same direction was given by the act as
to all moneys thereafter paid into said courts, "or received by
the officers thereof." § 2. All payments out of such moneys
were to be entered of record by the clerk. § 3. It was further
provided that if any "clerk of such court," or other officer thereof, " receiving any such moneys," should refuse or neglect to
obey the order of the court for depositing the same, such clerk
or other officer was liable to be forthwith proceeded against by
attachment for contempt. § 4. The same act imposed upon the
clerk the duty of presenting an account at each session of court
of all moneys remaining therein. § 5. 3 Stat. 395.
The acts of 1814 and 1817 were technically repealed by the
act of March 24, 1871, entitled " An act relating to moneys
paid into the courts of the United States. 17 Stat. 1, c. 2. But

HOWARD v. JNITED- STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the act of 1871 retained substantially all the provisions of thetivo
former acts and added others. That act provided, among other:
things, that all moneys in the registry of any court of the United
States, or "in the hands or under the control of an officer of
such court, which were received in any cause pending or adjudicated in such court," should within thirty days after the passage
of the act be deposited with the Treasurer, an assistant treasurer,
or a designated depositary of the United States, in the name and
to the credit of such court; that all such moneys which were thereafter paid into such courts," or received by the officers thereof,"
should be forthwith deposited in like manner; that if any clerk
or other officer of a court of the United States deposited any
money belonging in the registry of the court in violation of that
act, or should retain or convert it to his own use, or to the use of
any other person, he should be deemed guilty of embezzlement,
and on conviction be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars and not more than the amount embezzled, or by imprisonment for a term of not less than one year nor more than
ten years, or both, at the discretion of the court; and that if any
person should knowingly receive from a clerk or other officer
of a court of the United States any money belonging in the
registry of the court as a deposit, loan or otherwise, in violation
of the act, he should be deemed guilty of embezzlement, and be
punished as therein provided.
These provisions of the act of 1871 have been substantially
reproduced in the following sections of Revised Statutes:
"1§798. At each regular session of any court of the United
States the clerk shall present to the court an account of all
moneys remaining therein, or subject to its order, stating in detail in what causes they are deposited, and in what causes payments have been made; and said account and the vouchers thereof shall be filed in the court."
"§ 995. All moneys paid into any court of the United States,
or received by the officers thereof,in any cause yending or aijudicated in such court, shall be forthwith deposited with the
Treasurer, an assistant treasurer, or a designated depositary of
the United States, in the name and to the credit of such court:
Provided, That nothing herein shall be -construed to prevent

OCTOBER TERM, 1601.
Opinion of the Court.

the delivery of any such money upon security, according to
agreement of parties, under the direction of the court.
"§ 996. No money deposited as aforesaid shall be withdrawn
except by order of the judge or judges of said courts respectively, in term or in vacation, to be signed by such judge or
judges, and to be entered and certified of record by the clerk;
and every such order shall state the cause in or on account of
which it is drawn."
"§ 5504. Every clerk or other officer of a court of the United States who fails forthwith to deposit any money belonging
in the registry of the court, or hereafter paid into court or received by the officers thereof, with the Treasurer and assistant
treasurer, or a designated depositary of the United States, in
the name and to the credit of such court, or who retains or converts to his own use or to the use of another any such money,
is guilty of embezzlement, and shall be punished by a fine not
less than five hundred dollars, and not more than the amount
embezzled, or by imprisonment not less than one year nor more
than ten years, or by both such fine and imprisonment; but
nothing herein shall be held to prevent the delivery of any
such money upon security, according to agreement, of parties
under the direction of the court.
"§ 5505. Every person who knowingly receives, from a clerk
or other officer of a court of the United States, any money
belonging in the registry of such court as a deposit, loan or
otherwise, is guilty of embezzlement, and shall be punished as
prescribed in the preceding section."
The statutory provisions to which we have referred-taken
in connection with section 828 of the Revised Statutes, giving
commissions to clerks for receiving, keeping and paying out
money in pursuance of any statute or order of court-show
the relation in which clerks of District and Circuit Courts have
always stood to moneys paid into court in pending causes.
They manifestly proceed on the ground that money paid into
court, under its sanction, may be received by a clerk, his duty
upon receiving it being forthwith to deposit the amount with
the Treasurer, assistant treasurer, or designated depositary of
the United States, in the name and to the credit of the court.

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

As soon as he receives the money he becomes responsible for it
under his bond, and that responsibility does not cease until he
deposits it as required by law. If after receiving the money he
appropriates it to his own use, or, which is the same thing, if
he deposits it in bank to his individual credit, he becomes liable
on his bond for the amount so misappropriated.
3. But it is said that the bond in suit having been given to
the United States, it must be deemed an instrument for the
sole benefit of the Government, and therefore no suit can be
maintained on it for the benefit of an individual suitor, although
such suitor may have been damaged by the failure of the clerk
to discharge his duty. This results, it is supposed, from the
fact that there is no statute expressly authorizing such a suit.
If this position be well taken, it would follow that the bonds
required to be given by clerks of the Federal courts are not in
any case for the protection of private suitors. We are of opinion that Congress never intended that any such condition of
things should exist, but intended that the bond of a clerk should
be for the protection of all suitors, public and private, and to
that end authorized his bond to be increased to forty thousand
dollars. It is impossible to suppose that, when requiring a clerk
to give bond to the United States "faithfully to discharge the
duties of his office, and seasonably to record the decrees, judgments and determinations of the court," Congress had in mind
the interests of the United States alone, and purposely refrained
from making any provision whatever for the security of private suitors in the Federal courts. Such a conclusion would
be inconsistent with the practice of a century, and would greatly
surprise the profession. As may well have been anticipated
when those courts were first established, the great mass of litigation in the District and Circuit Courts of the United States
has always been between individuals, and consequently the
words above quoted, it must be assumed, had reference to individual suitors as well as to the United States. In our opinion, the bond of the clerk is for the benefit of every suitor injured by the failure of that officer faithfully to discharge his
duties or seasonably to record the decrees, judgments and determinations of the court. It must have been so understood

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

when the courts of the United States were established and provision made for the appointment of clerks who should be entitled
to receive the moneys of suitors when paid into court under its
sanction or pursuant to any statute.
A well considered case upon this general subject is that of
McDonaNld v. Atkins, 13 Neb. 568. That was an action on a
clerk's bond to recover the amount received by him from a sheriff who had collected it on an execution. The point was made
that the clerk was not authorized by statute to accept payment
of a judgment, and so the court of original jurisdiction held in
that case. The Supreme Court of the State said: "No one can
doubt, we think, that this ruling was in direct conflict with the
general understanding of the legal profession of this State as
to the duty of court clerks in the receipt and disbursement of
money paid 'upon judgments, from the first organization of our
judicial system, through all its changes, down to the present
time. Indeed, we doubt exceedingly that any one, especially
a practicing lawyer, has ever supposed that upon the rendition
of a money judgment, the defendant could not prevent a further
accumulation of costs and interests, and have a satisfaction legally entered of record, by at once paying to the clerk of the
court the amount which it calls for. If he could not-if clerks
are really without authority to receive money on judgments in
their custody, then to whom, in the absence of the plaintiff and
his attorney, could payment be legally made? .
. While
it is true that we have no statute which in express terms declares that the clerks of the several courts shall accept payment
of judgments in their custody, it is very evident that the legislature contemplated and intended that they should do so. .
.
And even in the absence of such provision, can it be doubted
that a party against whom a money judgment is sought by action may, upon being summoned, pay the amount demanded
'into court,' and thereby prevent the making of any further
costs? But how is it to be effected? In the case of inferior
courts-those not of record, and unprovided with clerks-the
payment can, of course, only be made to the judge or magistrate in person; but in courts of record, where all the steps
taken in the progress of the case, from the commencement to

HOWARD v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the satisfaction of final judgment, are recorded and preserved,
and where a clerk for the performance of this duty is specially
provided, it is otherwise. In these courts payments of money
are never made to the judge, but the uniform practice in this
State has always been to make them to his clerk, to whose custody and care the files, records, and whatsoever else relates to
cases in courts, are confided. And this practice, so universal,
although not positively directed by any act of the legislature,
conflicts with none, and, as we have shown, is recognized by
and in perfect harmony with several." These observations are
strikingly applicable in the present case.
Two cases often cited in support of the contrary view are
Commonwealth v. Hatch, 5 Mass. 191, and Crocker, Trea urer
&c., v. Tales, 13 Mass. 260. These cases will be found, upon
examination, to rest upon grounds not applicable here.
Commonwealth v. Hatch was a suit upon a bond given by an
inspector of beef for the faithful performance of his duties.
The suit was brought in the name of the Commonwealth for
the benefit of one alleged to have been injured by the unfaithfulness of the inspector in his office. It was held that the action could not be sustained-the decision being placed, in part,
upon the ground that it appeared "by the statute directing the
bond, and by the bond, that it was given for the sole use of the
Commonwealth." Surely, it cannot be said that it appears by
the statutes and by the bond in the present case that it was
given for the sole use of the United States.
Crocker, Treasurer &c., v. Tales was an action upon a bond
of a clerk in the penalty of $1000, the obligee being a county
treasurer, and the action being in his name for the use of one
claiming to be injured by his neglect to pay certain moneys that
came to his hands. The court held that the action could not
be maintained, assigning as reasons for that conclusion that
there was "nothing in the act" under which the bond was
taken showing "a design to protect individual sufferers against
the negligence of the clerk to pay over moneys which may
come into his hands ;" that the penalty-between fifty and
three hundred pounds-was discretionary with the court, "the
largest of these sums being wholly inadequate if it was intended

to cover all possible delinquencies of a clerk;" that the damages recovered by one plaintiff " might consume the whole penalty, and the public be left without any of the security which
was intended for the preservation of the records;" and that, in
addition, "the statute makes such an appropriation of the sum
which may be recovered by the treasurer on a suit as is wholly
inconsistent with the suyposition that an individual has an interest in the bond." Of course, these things cannot be predicated of the statutory provisions relating to the bonds of clerks
of Federal courts, and therefore the case cited is not in point
here.
The suggestion that the amount of the bond was insufficient
to protect both the United States and private suitors is not controlling; for, by the act of March 3,1863, c. 93, 12 Stat. 768, reproduced in section 795 of the Revised Statutes, the court could
fix the amount of the bond, and require a new one whenever it
deemed proper, and by the act of" February 22, 1875, the Attorney General could require a bond for as much as forty thousand dollars.
4. A further contention is, that even if the bond was for the
protection of individual litigants, it could not be put in suit by
a private person, unless with the consent of the United States
expressed in an act of Congress.
It is supposed that the case of Corporationof Washington v.
Young, 10 Wheat. 406, 409, is authority for this position.
That was an action brought in the name of the Corporation of
Washington for the use of one McCue and others, to recover
from a manager of a lottery scheme the prize drawn by the purchasers of a certain ticket. The lottery was drawn in pursuance
of an ordinance of the Corporation, and the bond of the manager,
in the penalty of ten thousand dollars, was conditioned "truly
and impartially to execute the duty and authority vested in
him by the ordinance." The suit was brought in the name of
the Corporation without its previous assent. Upon examination of the record in that case it will be found that the lottery
was drawn under an act of Congress, approved May 4, 1812,
c. 75, amending the charter of the city of Washington, and
which gave the Corporation of Washington power "to author-

ize the drawing of lotteries for effecting any important public
improvement in the city -which the ordinary funds or revenue
thereof will not accomplish; provided, that the amount to be
raised in each year shall not exceed the sum of ten thousand
dollars; and provided also, that the object for which the
money is intended shall be first submitted to the President of
the United States, and shall be approved by him." Act of
May 4, 1812, c. 75, 2 Stat. 721, 26, § 6. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said: "They [the proprietors of
the ticket] had undoubtedly 'a right to apply to the Corporation to direct the suit, and the Corporation could not, consistently with their duty, have refused such application,' if the
purpose of the bond was to secure the fortunate adventurers in
the lottery, not to protect the Corporation itself. But the propriety of bridging such a suit was a subject on which the obligees had themselves a right to judge. If the proprietors of
one prize ticket had an interest in this bond, the proprietors of
every other prize ticket had the same interest ; and it could
not be in the power of the first bold adventurer who should
seize upon it, to appropriate it to his own use, and to force the
obligees to appear in court as plaintiffs against theirown will.
No person who is not the proprietor of an obligation can have
a legal right to put it in suit, unlets such right be given by the
Legislature; and no person can be authorized to use the name
of another, without his assent given in fact, or y legal intendment!)
That case undoubtedly is authority for the proposition that,
generally speaking, an obligation taken under legislative sanction cannot, in the absence of a statute so providing, be put in
suit in the name of the obligee, the proprietor of the obligation,
without his consent. But it also sustains the proposition that
consent may, under some circumstances, be assumed to have
been given; that is, may arise by legal intendment. In the
case just cited it was deemed plain from the ordinance of the
Corporation that the bond was taken, primarily at least, for its
protection and not for the benefit of ticket holders. The object for which the Corporation was empowered to establish
lotteries was in its nature temporary and local, namely, to aid in

making important public improvements. It was to secure the
accomplishment of that object that the managers were required
to execute a bond. It was not unreasonable to suppose that in
taking such a bond the Corporation had in mind to protect itself in making the public improvements which it was authorized
to undertake. In the present case, courts of the United States
were established in order that its jurisdiction might be invoked
by all entitled to do so, and the requirement that the clerk
should execute a bond for the faithful discharge of his duties
and for the seasonable recording of the judgments, decrees, and
determinations of the court-no distinction being made between
public and private suitors-was an assurance to all suitors that,
within the limit of the penalty of any bond taken from him by
the Government, their rights would be protected against any
act or omission on his part resulting to their injury. By the
terms of the statute a clerk's bond remained in the custody or
subject to the order of the court. In our opinion, Congress intended that the required bond should protect private suitors as
well as the United States, and therefore, no statute forbidding
it, a private suitor may bring an action thereon for his benefit
in the name of the obligee, the United States. Such must be
held to be the legal intendment of existing statutory provisions.
The United States, or rather the court which had custody of
the bond, is to be regarded as a trustee for any party injured
by a breach of its conditions.
Murfree in his Treatise on Official Bonds says: "§ 323. It
is usually provided in statutes authorizing official bonds to be
required of state, county or municipal officers, that suits may
be brought upon them in the name of the official obligee ' upon
the relation' or 'to the use' of the party injured by the breach
of the bond or interested in its enforcement. Whenever, however, this express provision is omitted in the statute itself the
deficiency is supplied by the construction given to such statutes
by the courts whenever a proper case for such a ruling is presented. In a Maryland case (1858), State, use, etc. v. vorwood,
12 Md. 177, 194, the court held that it was not necessary for a
plaintiff before instituting a suit upon an official bond payable
to the State, to obtain the State's permission to do so; and this

although there was in the statute which prescribed the bond no
specific provision for making the bond payable to the State, or
for giving the party interested the right to sue upon it. The
court adds, however, that ' there is no doubt that it is incumbent on the party suing on the bond, to show that he has an
interest in it, before he could recover in a regular trial prosecuted to verdict.' The Tationale of official bonds is well expressed by the court in this case: ' The laws which provide for
the execution of bonds similar to the one before us, do not require them for the purpose of protecting the rights of the State
alone. They are also designed to secure the faithful performance of official duties, in the discharge of which individuals and
corporations have a deep interest, and, therefore, they should
have the privilege of suing [on] such bonds for injuries sustained
by them, through the negligence and malconduct of the officers.'" The same author: "Many bonds of a strictly official
character are executed by persons in places of public trust, prescribed by statute, and made payable to the 'State,' 'people,'
or ' Commonwealth,' or else to the governor, president or other
chief officer, which are designed not only to secure public interests, but to redress wrongs to individuals. Actions on such
bonds must, of course, be brought in the name of the obligee,
whether the object of the suit be to enforce the rights of the
State or to protect private interests. In the latter case it is
usual to bring the suit as by the obligee, ' at the relation' or
for the use' of the real party in interest."
Stress is laid upon the fact that in the case of a marshal of
the United States the statute expressly gives a right of action
upon his bond to any one injured by his neglect of duty-the
suit to be in the name of the party injured and for his sole use.
Act of April 10, 1806 ; Rev. Stat. § 784; 2 Stat. 372, 374, c. 21.
A similar provision is made in the case of consular officers who
are required to give bond for the faithful performance of their
duties-such suit to be in the name of the United States for the
use of the person injured. Rev. Stat. § 1735. These provisions
in relation to marshals and consular officers undoubtedly furnish some ground for the contention that Congress, having
made no such express provision in the case of the bonds of

694

clerks, did not intend that private suits should be maintained
upon their bonds. We are of opinion that this argument, although not without force, ought not to prevail against the legal
intendment of the statutory provisions relating to clerks, who
bold a peculiar relation to the courts appointing them, as well
as to the public.
As the clerk had the right to receive the money in question;
as he failed, to the injury of the suitor from whom he received
it, with the sanction of the court in a pending cause, to deposit
it as required by law, and appropriated it to his own use; and
as his bond was for the protection of private suitors as well as
for the Government, there is no sound reason why the plaintiff
could not enforce his rights by a suit in the name of the United
States for his benefit.
Perceiving no error in the record the judgment is
Aflrrmed.
