OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

UNITED STATES v. OAMOU.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF PRIVATE
No. 35.

LAND

CLAIMS.

Submitted March 22, 1901.-Decided March 17, 1902.

From its examination of the evidence in this case this court concurs in the
view of the Court of Private Land Claims that a definite location and
possession of the grant here in question, prior to the date of the Gadsden treaty, are shown with reasonable certainty, and affirms the decree
of that court confirmingthe claim to the extent of the four sitios granted
and paid for.

IN December, 1891, Juan Pedro Camou filed a petition in the

Court of Private Land Claims, praying to have confirmed to
him a certain tract of land situated in the county of Cochise,
Territory of Arizona, known and designated as the San Rafael
del Valle grant. Subsequent proceedings resulted in a trial and
a decree in favor of the Government, adjudging petitioner's
claim and title invalid, and dismissing the petition. The case
was then brought by appeal to this court, where the decree of
the Court of Private Land Claims was reversed and the case
remanded for further proceedings. 171 U. S. 277.
Subsequently further proceedings were had in the Court of
Private Land Claims in pursuance of the mandate of this
court, resulting, on June 2, 1899, in a decree confirming the
petitioner's title to 17,474.93 acres. From this decree of confirmation an appeal was allowed to this court.

MR. JUSTICE SHIRAs delivered the opinion of the court.

When this cause was before us, in 171 U. S. 277, the validity
of the claim was, upon full consideration, upheld. It was, however, held that the recovery should be restricted to the land

claimed in the petition and paid for, and as it was shown that
the survey was in excess of the land granted and paid for, the
cause was remanded to the Court of Private Land Claims for
further proceedings which resulted, as shown by this record,.
in a final decree of confirmation, establishing the boundaries
of the grant, *andfinding it to contain four sitios, or 17,4714.93
acres.
The contention made on behalf of the Government, in this
appeal, is that this grant of four sitios was a mere float within
exterior boundaries containing a larger tract; that there were
no means afforded of identifying where, within those exterior
boundaries, such four sitios were located; that accordingly, as
matter of law, prescribed in the sixth section of the Gadsden
treaty, the tract cannot be said to have been located, and hence
the grant must be held to be invalid.
It may well be doubted whether, even if this contention
were well founded, it can be urged at this stage of the controversy.
When the case was originally tried in the Court of Private
Land Claims, and subsequently was heard on appeal in this
court, the principal contention on the part of the Government
was that the State of Sonora had no power to make a grant of
public lands, and hence that the grant in question, although
made in the name and by the proper officers of that State, was
invalid. The subject was fully considered by this court, and it
was held that the several States of the Republic of Mexico, of
which Sonora was one, had, at the time when the transaction
in question took place, authority to make sales of vacant public
lands within their limits.
The Government further contended that this and similar
grants by the separate States had been annulled by certain decrees of Santa Anna, when acting as dictator of Mexico, and
that, as the Government of the United States had recognized
Santa Anna, in purchasing the territory covered by the Gadsden treaty, the courts of the United States must recognize, when
dealing with personal rights existing in the ceded territory, his
declarations or decrees in respect to titles, as authoritative.
But this view of the legal effect of the decrees of Santa Anna

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

upon the private rights of residents within the ceded territory
was not accepted by this court, and, for reasons given in the
opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer, it was held that, as the grant
made by the State of Sonora was valid when made, it was not
destroyed by the arbitrary decree of a temporary dictator.
As, however, it appeared that the survey of the land claimed
in the petition was in excess of the four sitios granted and paid
for, the court applied the rule laid down in Ely's Administrator
v. United States, 171 U. S. 220, that where there is a valid grant
for a certain number of acres within the outboundaries of a
larger tract, the Court of Private Land Claims may inquire,
and, if it finds sufficient reasons for determining the true boundaries of the tract that was granted, it can so prescribe them,
and sustain the claim to that extent.
Upon this second appeal we have only to consider whether
the Court of Private Land Claims reached its final decree in due
pursuance of the previous opinion and mandate of this court.
The decision there made is the law of the case, and is not open
for reconsideration in the subsequent appeal. This subject was
recently considered in llinois v. Illinois Central Railroad,184
U. S. 77, and it was there shown that it is the settled law of
this court that, after a case has been brought here and decided,
and a mandate issued to the court below, if a second writ of
error is sued out, it brings up for revision nothing but the proceedings subsequent to the mandate. None of the questions
which were before the court on the first writ of error can be
reheard or examined on the second. To allow a second writ
of error or appeal to a court of last resort on the same questions
which were open to dispute on the first would lead to endless
litigation. In chancery a bill of review is sometimes allowed
on petition to the court; but there would be no end to a suit
if every obstinate litigant could, by repeated aippeals, compel a
court to listen to criticisms on their opinions, or speculate on
chances for changes in its members.
Accordingly, in the present case, everything involved in the
question of the validity of the grant might be deemed to have
been determined on the first appeal, as well its alleged invalidity
for want of definite location, as for the want of power in the

UNITED STATES v. CAMOU.
Opinion of the Court.

State of Sonora to make the grant. However, even if this
view were waived, and it were conceded that our former mandate left it open to the Government to urge the invalidity
of the grant by reason of alleged want of definite location,
our examination of the record has satisfied us that the final
decree of the Court of Private Land Claims defining the boundaries of the grant was justified by the evidence.
It is clearly shown that on March 12, 1827, Rafael Elias presented his petition to the treasurer general of the State of Sonora, asking for a grant of public lands adjacent to the ranch
of San Pedro, within the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz; that on
July 1, 1827, the treasurer general issued an order directed to
the alcalde of the police of Santa Cruz, empowering him to proceed to survey, appraise and offer at public sale for thirty consecutive days the lands indicated in the petition; that on
August 20, 1827, in obedience to said order, the alcalde executed what is called an act of obedience, wherein he stated that
he would go to the ranch of San Pedro in order to proceed
with the survey of the lands petitioned for; that he appointed
four citizens to act as counters, tallymen and chainmen, who
were duly qualified; that the survey was so proceeded in that
there resulted a segregated tract pf land containing four sitios,
of which Rafael Elias took possession; that, at the conclusion
of the survey, the testimonio states the alcalde proceeded to the
appraisement of the land through experts, who adjudged the
value of the four sitios to be $240, at the rate of $60 each,- and
that upon this appraisement the alcalde put them up at auction,
asking for bidders, for thirty consecutive days, from August 30
to September 30, 1827. On September 30,1827, after summoning the interested party, the alcalde remitted the proceedings
to the treasurer general, who transmitted them to the fiscal attorney, who on February 7, 1828, reported his opinion that
"the proceedings be continued to adjudication, according to the
forms and requisites in use." The testimonio then states that
the treasurer general, being satisfied ivith the report of the
fiscal attorney, by order of April 16 proceeded, asking for bidders, and none appearing, the four sitios were auctioned off in
favor of Rafael Elias. The testimonio further discloses that

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

the purchase money was duly paid into the treasury, and a certificate of the treasurer general, of April 21, 1828, concluded
the proceedings; that, on December 25, 1832, followed the
grant or patent by the treasurer general of the State of Sonora,
stating that the proceedings had been concluded with all the
requisites and formalites provided by law, and remained in the
custody of the treasurer general as a perpetual monument of
title; that therefore, in the exercise of the faculties conferred
on him by law, and in the name of the sovereign State of Sonora, he granted in due form of law the four sitios of land for
the raising of cattle and horses, comprised in the locality of
San Rafael del Valle, situated in the jurisdiction of the presidio
of Santa Cruz, in favor of the citizen Rafael Elias, to whom he
conceded, gave and adjudged the said land by way of sale, with
the condition and premanency established by the law, for himself and his successors, with the injunction and condition that
he must keep said sitios occupied and settled, without letting
them be abandoned or deserted at any time, with the understanding that if they be abandoned for the period of three consecutive years, and there should be any person to petition for
them, in such event, with previous proof of the fact, they would
be declared public lands and granted anew to the highest bidder,
excepting in such cases where the abandonment was caused by
the notorious invasion of the public enemies; and admonishing
said Elias and his successors that they must keep and confine
themselves to the land and limits as marked precisely in the
foregoing proceedings of survey, and comply exactly with the
law which imposed obligations to mark the metes and boundaries with monuments of stone and mortar. It is admitted
by the Government that the expediente of this grant is on file
in the archives of Hermosillo, aid is in the usual form, and that
on folio 11 and on the back of it, of the book of "Toma de Razon," is recorded an entry of the delivery of the title deed to
Rafael Elias for four sitios of land, comprised in the place
called Rafael del Valle, situate in the jurisdiction of the presidio of Santa Cruz. This was followed by evidence showing
the continuous possession of the tract by Rafael Elias until
forced to leave it by hostile incursions of the Apache Indians.

UNITED STATES v. CAMOU.
Opinion of the Court.

There was also proof of a regular deraigument of title from the
original grantee to Camou, the appellee in the present case.
Taken together, the evidence adduced by the claimant on the
first trial before the Court of Private Land Claims, and that introduced after our mandate had gone to that court, we think it
is satisfactorily shown that the land described in the final decree is that described in the original survey and of which Rafael
Elias was put in possession. The principal witnesses, in this
part of the case, were George J. IRoskruge, a surveyor of more
than twenty years' experience in that part of the country, and
who made the survey and map of the San Rafael del Yalle land
grant, which was used upon the trial. Douglass Snyder and
Max Marks, who assisted in making that survey, were also examined. These witnesses were subjected to a rigorous crossexamination by the attorney of the Government, and their testimony has been minutely criticised in his brief.
But we are not able to perceive that the statements of these
witnesses have been materially shaken. Some discrepancies indeed appear, but they are not important, and are naturally to be
expected from the nature of the case. Neither the original nor
the subsequent surveys were made with the care and precision
that characterize surveys made in the long settled parts of the
country. But it is evident, and this is the important point, that
the latter surveys were made to verify and renew the original
survey, and not with a purpose to locate a floating grant of uncertain boundaries and extent. In this particular this case is
plainly distinguishable from the case of Ainsz v. United States,
161 U. S. 208, where the claimant's case failed because there
had been no actual location of the grant prior to the Gadsden
treaty, and because there was no satisfactory evidence that the
act of juridical possession had ever taken place.
From our examination of the evidence we concur in the view
of the Court of Private Land Claims, that a definite location
and possession of the grant in question, prior to the date of the
Gadsden treaty, are shown with reasonable certainty, and accordingly the decree of that court, confirming the claim to the
extent of the four sitios granted and paid for, is
