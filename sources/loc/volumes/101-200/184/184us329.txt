CLARK v. TITUSVILLE
Counsel for Parties.

Court was without jurisdiction to render judgment upon any
claim or claims, whether bonds or coupons, held by a single
person, firm or corporation against the city and which, considered apart from the claim or claims of other owners, could not
have been sued on by the real owner by reason of the insufficiency of the amount of such claim or claims.
The specifications of error assigned cover eighty pages of
the elaborate brief of counsel for the city. They present many
minor questions that are not discussed in this opinion. But
what has been said embraces every point of substance or that
requires consideration and disposes of the case upon its real
merits.
The judgment of the Circuit Cour"t of Appeals is reversed,
with directions to the Circuit Cou't to set aside its judgment and enter such judgment as may be in conformity
with this opinion.

CLARK v. TITUSVILLE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF PENqSYLVANIA.

No. 91. Argued and submitted January 14,1902.-Decided March 3,1902.
The city government of Titusville, in Pennsylvania, imposed a license tax
upon persons carrying on certain occupations in that city. This court
holds that it was a tax on the privilege of doing business, regulated by
the amount of the sales, and was not repugnant to the Constitution of
the United States.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.
-Y. Eugene 3facl ey for plaintiff in error.
-1fr. George Frank Brown for defendant in error, submitted
on his brief.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE McKrNNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is here on error to the Supreme Court of the State
of Pennsylvania. It involves the constitutionality of an ordinance of the city of Titusville imposing a license tax upon the
merchants of the city. The particular contention is that the
ordinance violates the equality prescribed by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that
it divides the merchants into arbitrary classes.
The trial court sustained the ordinance, and its judgment was
affirmed by the Supreme Court upon the opinion delivered by
the trial court.
The case was submitted upon a case stated in the nature of a
special verdict, from which it appeared that the city was duly
incorporated, and passed on June 25, 1888, the ordinance complained of. The provisions of the ordinance were set out, and
it was stipulated that if the court should be of the opinion
that the ordinance was valid a fine should be entered against
the defendant (plaintiff in error) for the total of the taxes prescribed.
The ordinance imposes a license tax upon persons who carry
on certain occupations in the city. Persons in different occupations pay different amounts, and persons in the same occupation are classified by maximum and minimum amount of sales.
For instance, persons dealing in merchandise are classified as
follows, and we quote from the opinion of the trial court:

It is with this classification that we have immediate concern,
because the plaintiff is a retail grocer. He was assessed in the
sixth class in 1895, and in the seventh class in 1896.
The objection that plaintiff makes to the ordinance is, that
it classifies by amount or value with the result (1) that the lowest amount or value of property of a class "is required to pay
the same amount of taxes with the highest amount or value of
property therein;" (2) that the differences are not in kind but
only in amount, or value, and that the taxes decrease in rate or
ratio as the value of the class increases; (3) that the so-called
classes are subdivisions of a class, and taxes are imposed upon
such subdivisions without regard to a common ratio, either as
between the several subdivisions, or as between the members
of each of the subdivisions. These objections are but the expression of the effect of classification by amount, and have
been made before and considered before by this court, and the
judgment has been adverse to the contention of plaintiff in
error. We do not think that it is necessary to review the cases
or enter again into the reasoning upon which they were based.
Classification by amount came up for consideration and decision in Afagoun v. .11inoisTrust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S.
283, and was sustained. That case, plaintiff in error recognizes,
may be urged against his contention and attempts to limit its
decision to the power of a State over inheritances, and to explain by that power not only the taxes imposed, but the dis-

Opinion of the Court.

criminations which were claimed to have resulted from grading
the taxes by the amount of the legacy. This, we think, is a
misunderstanding of the opinion. The contentions of the parties in the case were extremely opposite. The appellee claimed
that the power of the State could be exerted to the extent of
making the State the heir of everybody; the appellant asserted
a natural right of children to inherit. We expressed no opinion on either contention, but chiefly directed our consideration
and decision to the alleged discriminating features of the law
of Illinois. We said: "Our inquiry must be not what will satisfy the provisions of the state constitutions, but what will satisfy the rule of the Federal Constitution. The power of the
States over successions may be as plenary in the abstract as
appellee contends for, nevertheless it must be exerted within
the limitations of that Constitution. If the power of devise
or of inheritance be a privilege, it must be conferred or regulated by equal laws."
The law of Illinois was charged with inequality of operation
because of the classes which it created. It was asserted, as it
is in the case at bar, that the classes were formed upon arbitrary differences, and the provisions of the statute which fixed
the tax upon legacies to strangers to the blood of the intestate
were vigorously assailed. Those provisions were as follows:
"On each and every hundred dollars of the clear market
value of all property and at the same rate for any less amount
on all estates of ten thousand dollars and less, three dollars;
on all estates over ten thousand dollars and not exceeding
twenty thousand dollars, four dollars; on all estates over
twenty thousand dollars and not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, five dollars; and on all estates over fifty thousand dollars,
six dollars. Provided, that an estate in the above case, which
may be valued at a less sum than five hundred dollars, shall not
be subject to any duty or tax."
Manifestly, there was inequality between the members of
different classes, and that was conceded in the opinion, but as
manifestly there was equality between the members of each
class, and that equality was held to satisfy the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; and the

CLARK v. TITUSVILLE.
Opinion of the Court.

reasoning by which that conclusion was supported is applicable
to the case at bar. We met the contention accurately and
squarely that there was no reasonable distinction between the
classes. We said:
"If there is inequality it must be because the members of a
class are arbitrarily made such and burdened as such, upon no
distinctions justifying it. This is claimed. It is said that the
tax is not in proportion to the amount but varies with the
amounts arbitrarily fixed, and hence that an inheritance of
$10,000 or less pays 3 per cent, and that one over $10,000 pays
not 3 per cent on $10,000 and an increased percentage on the
excess over $10,000, but an increased percentage on the $10,000
as well as on the excess, and it is said, as we have seen, that in
consequence one who is given a legacy of $10,000 and one dollar by the deduction of the tax receives $99.04 less than one
who is given a legacy of $10,000. But neither case can be
said to be contrary to the rule of equality of the Fourteenth
Amendment. That rule does not require, as we have seen, exact
equality of taxation. It only requires that the law imposing it
shall operate on all alike under the same circumstances. The
tax is not on money, it is on the right to inherit, and hence a
condition of inheritance, and it may be graded according to
the value of that inheritance. The condition is not arbitrary
because it is determined by that value; it is not unequal in operation because it does not levy the same percentage on every
dollar; does not fail to treat 'all alike under like circumstances
and conditions, both in the privilege conferred and the liabilities imposed.' The jurisdiction of courts is fixed by amounts.
The right of appeal is. As was said at bar, the Congress of the
United States has classified the right of suitors to come into
the United States courts by amounts. Regarding these alone,
there is the same inequality that is urged against classification
of the Illinois law. All license laws and all specific taxes have
in them an element of inequality; nevertheless they are universally imposed, and their illegality has never been questioned."
Plaintiff in error, however, contends that the tax in the case
at bar is a tax on property, not on the privilege to do business,
because the final incidence of the tax is on the merchant, and

is paid by him. But every tax has its final incidence on some
individual. That effect, therefore, cannot be urged to destroy
well recognized distinctions. The tax in the case at bar is a
tax on the privilege of doing business regulated by the amount
of sales, and is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United
States.

ROTHSCHILD v. KNIGHT.
ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 108.

Submitted October 21, 1901.-Decided Ilarch 3, 1902.

A motion being made to dismiss the writ of error in this case on the ground
that no Federal question was raised in the Superior Court of Massachusetts this court holds that as Federal questions were raised on writ of
error to the Supreme Court of that State, that was sufficient to give this
court jurisdiction.
The objection that the writ of error should have been directed to the Supreme Court, and not to the Superior Court, is answered by McDonald v.
Massachusetts,180 U. S. 311.
To what actions the remedy of attachment may be given is for the legislature of a State to determine: the power of counsel extends to consenting
to amendments authorized by the law of the State.
The contention that the debts due to plaintiffs in error by certain citizens
of Massachusetts were not subject to attachment in that State because
their situs was in New York cannot be maintained.
The preference given by MIcKeon to plantiffs in error was consummated in
Massachusetts; and therefore the proceedings had in New York were immaterial.

JAMES MCKEON was a retail merchant in Springfield, Massachusetts, and became indebted to plaintiffs in error in the sum
of about $4000.
The indebtedness being overdue, Frank J. Rothschild, Jr.,
son of one of the plaintiffs in error, went to Springfield with full
