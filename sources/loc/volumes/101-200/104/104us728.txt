[Sup. Ct.

UNITED STATES V. SAVINGS BANK.
1. The Court of Claims has jurisdiction of a suit brought against the United
States to recover back certain taxes and penalties alleged to be of the
character mentioned in sects. 3220, 3228, Rev. Stat., where payment thereof
was refused to the plaintiff, whose claim thereto had in due time been presented on appeal to and allowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
United States v. Knainon (06 U. S. 567) cited and approved.
2. Lodging the appeal with the proper collector of internal revenue, for transmission to the commissioner in the usual course of business, under the
requirements of the treasury regulations, is in effect the presentation of it
to the commissioner.
APPEAL from the Court of Vlaims.

Sections 3220 and 3228 of the Revised Statutes are as follows "SECT. 3220. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject
to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, is
authorized, on appeal to him made, to remit, refund, and pay back
all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, all penalties
collected without authority, and all taxes that appear to be unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in any manner wrongfully
collected . ...
"SEcT. 3228. All claims for the refunding of any internal tax
alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,
or of any penalty alleged to have been collected without authority,
or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner
wrongfully collected, must be presented to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue within two years next after the cause of action
accrued. ...."

The material regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury applicable to this case are these : "Claims for the refunding of taxes erroneously assessed and collected should be presented through the collectors of the respective
districts upon blank form No. 46 ...
"The collector should keep a perfect record, in a book furnished
for the purpose, of all claims presented to the commnissioner, and
must certify as to each claim, whether it has been before presented
or not.
"Where the case of an appeal involves an amount exceeding

two hundred and fifty dollars, and before it is finally decided the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue will transmit the case, with the
evidence in support of it, to the Secretary of the Treasury for his
consideration and advisement.
For some years it has been the practice of the officers of the
Treasury Department to regard appeals for refunding taxes
illegally assessed and paid, when deposited with collectors, under the rules, in season to be forwarded to. Washington within
the two years' limitation, to have been duly presented to the
commissioner according to law.
On the 10th of July, 1878, the Real Estate Savings Bank of
Pittsburg, Pa., paid to the collector of internal revenue for the
proper district in Pittsburg, certain internal taxes which had
before that time been assessed; and on the 9th of July, 1880,
it presented to the same collector, at his office, an appeal to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, made out on the blank
form prescribed by the secretary, to refund and pay back
$972.69, which, it was alleged, had been illegally assessed, and
erroneously paid. This appeal was delivered to the collector
in time to have reached Washington by due course of mail on
the 10th of July, if it had been promptly forwarded; but it
was retained until the 15th, when it was sent to the commissioner, with an indorsement by the collector that he had investigated the facts, and found the statements of the claimant
were in all respects true.
The papers reached the commissioner on the 17th of July, and be, on the 13th of October
following, submitted them to the Secretary of the Treasury, as
required by the regulations, for his consideration and advice.
On the 18th of October the secretary signified to the commissioner his approval of the payment of the claim, and on the
21st the commissioner certified its allowance. On the presentation of this certificate through the accounting oflicers of the
Treasury Department payment was refused. The certificate
has never been revoked by either the secretary or the commissioner, but it is still in force so far as the action of these
officers is concerned.
After payment was refused, suit was
brought on the certificate in the Court of Claims, where judgment was given for the claimant. From this judgment the
United States appealed.

[Sup. Ct.

The Solicitor-General, Mr. William Lawrence, and A.. John
S. Blair for the United States.
The following points are taken from Mr. Lawrence's brief:
I. The claim is barred because not presented at the office of
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Washington within
two years.
1. The statute says such claim "must be presented to the
Re. Stat., sect. 3220.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
The commissioner has an office "in the Department of the
Treasury" (id., sect. 319), and this "shall be at the seat of
government." Id., sect. 233. The claim is to be "settled and
adjusted in the Department of the Treasury." Id. 236. Effect
is to be given to the words as they are, " not importing . . .
Leavenworth, J'c. Railroad
words . . . not found there."
Co. v. United States, 92 U. S. 733, 751. A presentation at
Pittsburgh is not a presentation "in the Department of the
Treasury."
The "treasury of the United States" is " in the treasury
building," and there the treasurer performs his duties. Rev.
Stat., sect. 3591.
Banks are required to make returns for taxation "to the
treasurer." Id., sect. 5215.
If for the convenience of the banks a regulation is made
(id., sect. 161) permitting them to make reports " through" a
sub-treasurer, are the banks relieved from the duty to still make
them " to the treasurer" ?
2. The "regulation" does not change this. It says claims
"should be presented through the collector." "Should" is not
This permits pre"shall," and if so, " through" is not "to."
sentation through a collector, but contemplates presentation to
the commissioner. The regulation is to be construed in harmony
with the statute, which gives the claimant a right to present
directly to the commissioner, but permits a collector to aid him.
3. The commissioner had no power to receive the claim after
two years, and any action thereon was ultra vires. An officer
cannot waive a right denied by statute. Andrae v. Redfield,
12 Blatchf. 407; United States v. McKnight, 98 U. S. 179.
The claim is, as said in United States v. Kaufman (96 id. 367,
570), "impeached for . . . mistake."

Oct. 1881.]

4. The duty imposed by statute on the commissioner cannot be delegated to a collector. Delegata potestas non potest
delegari.
It is the ri.ht of the claimant to have the privilege of presenting his claim at the office of the commissioner.
5. A claimant cannot impose a duty on a collector to receive
a claim. Official duties are fixed by law. Ames v. Huron,
L. & B. Co., 11 Mich. 147 ; Cooley, Const. Lim. 363, 451.
II. The allowance of the commissioner does not give a prima
facie right of action. Rev. Stat., sect. 1059.
The test, whether such allowance gives such right, is this:
Is it evidence of a "promise on the part of the United States
to pay" (United States v. Kaufman, supra), or an award showing a debt due; that is, does it per se so operate? If it does
not, per se, impose a duty on all officers charged with duties
in relation to it to make payment without examining the evidence on which it is based, how can it be said that it is the
evidence which the law requires of a right to payment? If
other steps are by law required to secure payment, how can it
be, per se, primafacie evidence of a right to payment?
1. It is "a mere step in the system of internal revenue."
House Ex. Doe. No. 27, 2d Sess. 45th Cong., p. 43.
2. The whole power of the commissioner is found in the
words "to refund and pay back."
These had a meaning when first used in the act of June 30,
1864, c. 173. The commissioner did literally " refund and pay
back," " by drafts drawn on collectors of internal revenue."
This power was taken away by the third section of the act of
March 3, 1865, c. 78, and the words to "refund and pay back"
became inoperative, - they ceased to have a meaning. The
commissioner could no longer literally " pay back."
Such claim cannot be paid unless it has been " settled and
adjusted in the Department of the Treasury." Rev. Stat., sects.
184, 187, 236, 248, 269, 277, 805, 313; McKnight's Case, 13
Ct. Cl. 302; 1 Op. Atty.-Gen. 624, 680; 2 id. 507; 10 id. 5.
The claimant must " pursue the statutory remedy to the
end." United States v. Kaufman, supra.
3. To hold that these words authorize the commissioner to
give evidence of a prima facie right of action seems objection-

able. The law (Rev. Stat., sects. 989, 3226, 3227) recognizes
a remedy by action against a collector. It would seem improbable that Congress intended to give a duplicate renedy by
action on the allowance of the commissioner.
If the allowance of the commissioner gives primafaeie right
of action against the United States, it is not barred until six
years (id., sect. 1069), when the government may have lost the
means of impeaching it, whereas Congress seems to have intended to limit the remedy by requiring a presentation within
two years to the commissioner (id., sect. 3228), and for a short
period against the collector. Id., sects. 983, 3226, 3227.
The approval of the commissioner has no element of a contract. le is not authorized to contract.
4. It will enable a claimant to withdraw from the government the benefit of an examination by the proper accounting
officers.
It should require clear language to produce such a result.
Whenever Congress has intended to withdraw from this
supervision any class of cases, it has been done in very explicit
language. Rev. Stat. sects. 48, 1089, 1911.
III. Congress having given another judicial remedy, it is to
be deemed exclusive. Rev. Stat., sects. 846, 989, 3226, 3227;
State v. llarlow, 15 Ohio St. 114; Commonwealth v. Garrigues,
28 Pa. St. 9; Commonwealth v. Baxter, 35 id. 263; Commonwealth v. Leech, 44 id. 332.
Mr. George L. Douglass for the appellee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The objections made to the recovery are, in substance: 1,
That the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction of the suit,
because the claim sued for was not founded on any law of
Congress, or upon contract; and, 2, That the appeal to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue was not taken within two
years after the cause of action accrued, and that consequently
the allowance by that officer was without any authority of
law,
The first of these objections is, we think, disposed of by
United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567. That case arose

Oct. 1881.]

under sect. 3426, Rev. Stat., which is as follows: "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue may, from time to time, make
regulations, upon proper evidence of facts, for the allowance
of such of the stamps issued under the provisions of this chapter, or any internal revenue act, and may have been spoiled,
. . and such allowance shall be made either by giving other
stamps in lieu of the stamps so allowed for, or by repaying the
amount or value, after deducting therefrom, in case of repayment, the sum of five per cent, to the owner thereof. ..."
And we held that the allowance of a claim by the commissioner under this section was equivalent to an account stated
between private parties, and binding on the United States,
until in some appropriate form it was impeached for fraud or
mistake, and that, if not paid on proper application through
the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, an action
might be maintained on it in the Court of Claims, because
it raised an implied promise on the part of the United States
to pay what might actually be due the claimant, and also because the claim therefor was founded on a law of Congress
within the meaning of that term as used in defining the jurisdiction of the court. We cannot discover any material difference between the powers of the commissioner under sect.
3426, and those which he has under sect. 3220.
Under
sect. 3426 he is to " allow" the claim, which is done either
by giving other stamps in lieu of those that have been spoiled,
&c., or by repaying the amount or value. Under sect. 3220
he is to " refund" and "pay back." His payments of money
in both cases must be made through the accounting officers
of the Treasnry Department, as he is not himself a disbursing officer. Whether his allowance is conclusive on the
other officers, through whose hands it must necessarily pass
before it can be paid by the treasurer, we did not then, and
need not now decide. All we said then, and all we say now is,
that if payment is not made by reason of the refusal of any of
the officers of the department to pass or pay the claim after it
has once been allowed by the commissioner, the allowance may
be used as the basis of an action against the United States in
the Court of Claims, where it will be prima facie evidence of
the amount that is due, and put on the government the burden
*

UNITED STATES V. SAVINGS BANK.

[Sup. Ct.

of showing fraud or mistake. This burden is not overcome by
proving that some other officer in the subsequent progress of
the claim through the department declined to do what the law
or treasury regulations required of him before payment could
be obtained. The fact of fraud or mistake must be established
by competent evidence, the same as any other fact in issue.
An allowance by the commissioner in this class of cases is
not the simple passing of an ordinary claim by an ordinary
accounting officer, but a statement of accounts by one having
authority for that purpose under an act of Congress. Until
an appeal is taken to the commissioner no suit whatever can
be maintained to recover back taxes illegally assessed or erroneously paid. If on the appeal the claim is rejected, an action
lies against the collector (Rev. Stat., sect. 3226), and through
him, on establishing the error or illegality, a recovery can be
bad. If the claim is allowed, and payment for any cause refused, suit may be brought directly against the government in
the Court of Claims. This, as it seems to us, is the logical
result of the legislation of Congress upon the subject. A rejected claim may be prosecuted against the collector, and an
allowed claim, not paid, may be sued for in the Court of
Claims. To say the least, the decision of the commissioner on
the appeal is sufficient to determine whether one form of
remedy shall be resorted to by the claimant, or the other.
Upon the other branch of the case we are entirely satisfied
with the conclusions reached by the court below, and that the
lodging of the appeal made out in due form with the proper
collector of internal revenue for the purpose of transmission to
the commissioner in the usual course of business, under the
requirements of the regulations of the secretary, was in legal
effect a presentation of the appeal to the commissioner. The
effect of the regulation was to designate the office of the collector of internal revenue as a proper place for the presentation of
the appeal. The whole subject is so fully and satisfactorily
considered in the opinion below, that we deem it unnecessary
to do more than refer to what is there said.
Judgment affirmed.
