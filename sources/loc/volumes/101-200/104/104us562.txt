1. The United States agreed to grant to the chief of an Indian tribe two sections
of land to be thereafter selected, and to convey them by patent. After
they had been selected, he aliened them by deed, in fee, with covenants of
warranty. The patent was issued after his death. Held, that the title to
the sections inured to and was vested in his alienee.
2. The courts of the United States take judicial notice of the public statutes of
the several States.

conformity to the laws of that State, and recorded in the county in Illinois,
where the granted lands are situate, a duly certified copy of the record,
with the requisite certificate of such conformity thereto annexed, is by the
statute of Illinois admissible in evidence.

fractional section 7, T. 37 N., R. 15 E., in Cook County, Illinois. By the third article of the treaty with the Potowatomies
of the State of Indiana and Michigan Territory, made on
the 27th of October, 1832 (7 Stat. 399), the United States
agreed to grant and to convey by patent to Ash-kun, one
of the chiefs, and a reservee under the treaty, two sections of
land to "be selected, under the direction of the President
of the United States, after the lands shall have been surveyed." Under this provision the lands now in dispute were
selected. The selection was approved by the President on
the 29th of March, 1837. Ash-kum died intestate in 1846.
On the 3d of November, 1864, after his death, a patent was
issued, conveying the lands

"

unto . . . Ash-kum, and to his

heirs and assigns forever." Both parties claim under this
patent: the plaintiff in error, who was also plaintiff below,
by deed from the heirs of Ash-kern; and the defendant by
deed with covenants of warranty from Ash-kum himself,
while in life, " to Louis De Salle, of the township of Niles,
in Berrien County, Michigan Territory," bearing date Oct. 24,
1835.
All the objections to the defendant's title, insisted on in the
argument, except those relating to the proof of the deed of
Ash-kum, and to the refusal of the court to charge as requested
by the plaintiff upon the assumption of fraud in its procurement, are, as we think, disposed of by Doe v. Wilson, 23 How.
457, and Crews v. Burehanm, 1 Black, 352. Similar reservations and grants under the same treaty were there involved,
and it was held that, when such a patent issued, the title to
the lands vested in those holding under any deed the patentee
might have previously made.
The principal controversy is as to the evidence admitted to
prove the deed. After proof of the loss of the original, a certified copy from the records of Cook County was offered in
evidence. The record was made on the 31st of May, 1836,
and the copy showed a deed purporting to convey the land,
signed by Ash-kum with his mark, sealed, and attested by
two witnesses.
The certificate of acknowledgment is as

The defendant also put in evidence a statute of Michigan
"concerning deeds and conveyances," in force at the date of

the deed. Laws of Mich. 1833, p. 279. It provided that deeds
of lands in that Territory, signed and sealed by the parties
granting the same, and signed by two or more witnesses, and
acknowledged by the parties, should be good and valid- to
pass title. The acknowledgment required might be made before, among other officers, a justice of the peace in any county
in the Territory, and a certificate of the acknowledgment being
indorsed on the deed, "and signed by the person before whom
the same was taken," the deed was entitled to be recorded.
To the admission of this evidence the plaintiff in due time
objected, and his objections having been overruled, exceptions

ELWOOD V. FLANNIGAN.

[Sup. Ct.

were taken and made part of the record. The assignments of
error relate principally to these exceptions.
By the statutes of Illinois in force when the deed in question was executed, a deed signed and sealed by the party making the same was sufficient for the conveyance of any lands in
that State. Rev. Laws 1833, p. 129, sect. 1. â€¢ To entitle such
a deed to record, however, an acknowledgment was required
before one of certain designated officers, among which were
justices of the peace. If the justice resided out of the State, it
was required that there be added to the deed a certificate of
the proper clerk, "setting forth that the person before whom
such . . . acknowledgment was made was a justice of the
peace at the time of making the same." Id., p. 138, sect. 1.
Further statutes provide that whenever a deed entitled to be
recorded is lost, a certified copy from the record may be used
in evidence with the same effect as the original. Rev. Stat.
1845, p. 103, sect. 25 ; id. 1874, p. 279, sect. 36.
By the Revised Statutes of Illinois adopted in 1845 (Rev.
Stat. 1845, p. 105, c. 24, sect. 16), it was enacted that a deed
made out of the State and within the United States should be
entitled to record when executed and acknowledged or proved
in conformity with the laws of the State, Territory, or district
where made, "provided, that any clerk of a court of record,
within such State, Territory, or district, shall, under his hand
and the seal of such court, certify that such deed or instrument
is executed and acknowledged or proved in conformity with the
laws of such State, Territory, or district." Then, in 1851, it
was further enacted (Scate's Stat. 972, sect. 5; Sess. Laws,
Feb. 15, 1871, p. 122) " that a certified copy of any deed, . . .
affecting any real estate situate within this State which has
been acknowledged without this State, in conformity with the
laws of the State where such deed . . . was acknowledged,
and which has been recorded in the proper county in this State,
shall be evidence in all courts and places: Provided, the party
offering such certified copy in evidence will exhibit with the
same a certificate of conformity, as provided for in the sixteenth section of chapter 24 of the Revised Statutes, notwithstanding said certificate of conformity has never been recorded."
And again, in 1874 (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 2 76, c. 30, sect. 20), "An

Oct. 1881.]

acknowledgment or proof may be made in conformity with
the laws of the State, Territory, or district where it is made:
Provided, that if any clerk of a court of record, within such
State, Territory, or district, shall, under his hand and the seal
of such court, certify that such deed or instrument is executed
and acknowledged or proved in conformity with the law of
such State, Territory, or district, or it shall so appear by the
laws of such State, Territory, or district, duly proved and certified copies of the record of such deed, mortgage, or other instrument relating to real estate, heretofore or hereafter made
and recorded in the proper county, may be read in evidence,
as in other cases of certified copies, upon such a certificate of
conformity to the laws of the State, Territory, or district
where such deeds, mortgages, or other instruments were made
and acknowledged, being exhibited therewith or annexed
thereto."
Such being the laws of the two States applicable to the
facts of this case, we proceed to the consideration of the specific objections to the evidence. These may be stated generally, as follows: 1. That the deed was not entitled to record
in Illinois because it was not accompanied by a certificate of
the proper clerk that the person before whom the acknowledgment was made was a justice of the peace; and, 2. That
the deed was not executed in conformity with the laws of
Michigan.
It is conceded that the deed was not acknowledged in conformity with the laws of Illinois, and it is no doubt true that
when recorded there was no law of that State which allowed
a certified copy to be used in evidence. It was, however, recorded in fact. Consequently, under the later statutes, if actually executed in conformity with the laws of Michigan, and
that fact was properly certified, the copy was admissible.
There is no question but that the deed, if executed, was in
form sufficient to convey the land. It was signed and sealed
by the grantor, and was otherwise sufficient as a conveyance
between the parties under the laws of Illinois. The whole
controversy here is as to the proof of its execution in conformity with the laws of Michigan, so as to make the copy from
the record competent evidence in place of the original. The

ELWOOD v. FLANNIGAN.

[Sup. Ot.

laws of Illinois, therefore, requiring the certificate of a clerk
in certain cases as to the official character of a justice of the
peace, are unimportant. If in Michigan such a certificate was
not necessary to complete the execution of the deed, none was
required in Illinois. Certainly a deed may be said to be fully
executed when all has been done that is necessary to entitle
it to record, and for that purpose in Michigan the evidence of
an acknowledgment was complete when the officer before
whom it was taken signed a certificate to that effect indorsed
on the deed. No provision was made for any authentication
of his official character. His certificate, made, as it must
necessarily be, under the obligations of his official oath, was
deemed sufficient.
Was, then, the deed executed in conformity with the laws
of Michigan ? Under the laws of Illinois, that fact may be
proven by the laws of Michigan themselves, or by the certificate of the proper clerk. There was probably no necessity for the proof of the laws of Michigan which was made,
as the courts of the United States take judicial notice of all
the public laws of the several States. Owings v. full, 9 Pet.
607; Covington Drawbridge Company v. Shepherd, 20 How.
227.
The deed was signed and sealed by the grantor, and it was
attested by two witnesses. Of that there can be no dispute.
It had indorsed upon it a certificate of acknowledgment signed
by Titus B. Willard, which set forth that he was one of the
justices of the peace of Berrien County, and that Ash-kum,
who was named in the deed as grantor, came before him and
acknowledged its execution. It is true the certificate does not
state that the officer was one who by law could take the acknowledgment of deeds, but it does state what the office was,
and as the statute makes it the official duty of one holding
such an office to take the acknowledgment of deeds, the statement of his official character necessarily included a statement
of his official authority.
It is next objected that the certificate does not state that
Ash-kum was personally known to the officer. There is nothing in the Michigan statute which requires any such statement, though there is in Illinois. It is enough in Michigan if

Oct. 1881.]

ELWOOD V. FLANNIGAN.

the officer certifies to the fact of an acknowledgment by the
proper party. That has been done in this case. The statement
is that Ash-kum, an Indian chief, came before the officer and
made the necessary acknowledgment. This implies that the
grantor was in some way known to the officer, and that the
acknowledgment was in fact made. The making of the certificate was an official act, done under the sanction of an official
oath, and is presumptively true. The laws of Michigan did
not require the officer to state in his certificate the evidence
by which the identity of the person was established in his
mind. It was enough that he certified to the fact.
The fact that the grantor was in this case an Indian is unimportant. The duty of the officer was precisely the same in
respect to him as it was to other men. The officer must, in
his case as in others, be satisfied of the identity of the person,
as well as of the fact of an acknowledgment. That being
done, it was his duty to make the certificate. There is nothing in Dewey v. Campau (4 Mich. 565) to the contrary of
this. There the deed was rejected because the officer in effect
only certified that he was told by an interpreter that an Indian woman made the acknowledgment, no power having been
given him to swear an interpreter for such a purpose. Here
the certificate is that an acknowledgment was in fact made.
That is enough until impeached.
It is next objected that there was no proof that Willard
was at the time in fact a justice of the peace. The laws of
Michigan required no other evidence of that fact to entitle a
deed to record than the certificate of the officer himself. That
was given in this case, and in addition it was shown that he
was acting as a justice of the peace at the time. This makes
it unnecessary to consider whether the certificate of the secretary of state, of the fact of his appointment, was competent
evidence. The law did not require a copy of his commission,
or proof of his having taken the official oath. It was sufficient that he was acting under color of right. That fact was
clearly shown. This disposes of the case, so far as the proof of
the deed was concerned. Having been executed in conformity with the laws of Michigan, and recorded, a certified copy,
with the requisite certificate of conformity annexed, was admis-

sible in evidence, according to the laws of Illinois, after proof
of the loss of the original.
In respect to the request which was made of the court to
charge the jury as to the effect of fraud in the procurement of
the deed, it is sufficient to say there is not a particle of evidence in the record to sustain such a claim. If the jury had

found for the plaintiff on any such theory, it would have been
the duty of the court to set the verdict aside and grant a new

trial. Consequently there was no error in refusing the charge
requested.
Judgment affirmed.

DAVIS v. FRIEDLANDER.
1. The assignment made to assignees in bankruptcy in proceedings which were
brought more than four months after attachments, issued in a chancery
suit pending in a State court, were levied upon the property of the bankrupt, does not divest the jurisdiction of that court to determine the priority
of lien respectively claimed by the attaching creditors, or to administer the
fund arising from the sale of the property.
2. His assignees in bankruptcy, if they enter their appearance in the suit, are
bound by the decree, affirming the validity of the liens acquired by the
levy of the writs, and directing the application of the proceeds of the sale
to satisfy them. The assignees cannot thereafter set up in any other court
their title to the property.
