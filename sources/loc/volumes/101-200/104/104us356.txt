reissue may be proper in such cases, though a longer period has
elapsed since the issue of the original patent. But in reference
to reissues made for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the
patent, the rule of laches should be strictly applied; and no
one should be relieved who has slept upon his rights, and has
thus led the public to rely on the implied disclaimer involved
in the terms of the original patent. And when this is a matter
apparent on the face of the instrument, upon a mere comparison of the original patent with the reissue, it is competent for
the courts to decide whether the delay was unreasonable, and
whether the reissue was therefor contrary to law and void.
We think that the delay in this case was altogether unreasonable, and that the patent could not lawfully be reissued for the
purpose of enlarging the claim and extending the scope of the
patent.
Decree affirmed.

CAMPBELL V.

JAMES.

CLEXTON V. CAMPBELL.
1. Norton's reissued letters-patent, dated Oct. 4, 1870, for an improved post-office
stamp for printing the post-mark and cancelling the postage-stamp at one
blow, are void, by reason of not being for the same invention specified in
the original.
2. If letters-patent fully and clearly describe and claim a specific invention, complete in itself, so as not to be inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective
or an insufficient specification, a reissue cannot be had for the purpose of
expanding and generalizing the claim in order to embrace an invention not
specified in the original. Burr v. Duryee (1 Wall. 531) reaffirmed.
3. In such case, the court ought not to be required to explore the history of the
art to ascertain what the patentee might have claimed: he is bound by his
statement describing the invention.
4. A patentee cannot claim in a patent the same thing claimed by him in a prior
patent; nor what lieomitted to claim in a prior patent in which the invention was described, he not having reserved the right to claim it in a separate
patent, and not having seasonably applied therefor.
5. Letters-patent for a machine cannot be reissued for the purpose of claiming
the process of operating that class of machines; because, if the claim for

the process is anything more than for the use of the particular machine
patented, it is for a different invention. Powder Company v. Powder Works
(98 U. S. 126) reaffirmed.
6. The government of the United States has no right to use a patented invention
without compensation to the owner of the patent.
7. Query, Can a suit be maintained against an officer of the government for
using such an invention solely in its behalf; and must not the claim for
compensation be prosecuted in the Court of Claims.

APPEALS from the Circuit Court of the United States for

the Southern District of New York.
The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court.
These cases were argued at the last term. Mr. AttorneyGeneral Devens and Mr. Samuel B. Clarke appeared for James.
Mr. George H. Williams, Mr. M. P. Norton, and Mr. Benjamin
F. Butler appeared for Campbell. Mr. Edward D. Bettons
appeared for Clexton.
MR. JUSTIcE, BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is founded on a bill in equity filed by Christopher
C. Campbell, the complainant below, against Thomas L. James,
United States, postmaster in and for the city of New York,
to enjoin him from using a certain implement for stamping
letters, which the complainant claims to have been patented to
one Marcus P. Norton, by letters-patent dated April 14, 1863,
and surrendered and reissued on the 23d of August, 1864; and
again surrendered and reissued on the 3d of August, 1869, and
again, finally, on the 4th of October, 1870. The complainant
claims to be assignee of Norton, the patentee. Other persons
claiming an interest in the patent were made parties to the
suit. The Circuit Court rendered a decree in favor of the
complainant, and adjusted the rights of the several parties to
the amount of the decree. The defendant, James, appealed.
The other parties, not being satisfied with the decree as it
affected their mutual interests, also appealed. The case is
now before us in all its aspects. Supposing the court below
to have had jurisdiction of the case, the first question to be
considered will be the liability of the principal defendant,
James, to respond for the use of the machine or implement in
question.
That the government of the United States when it grants

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

letters-patent for a new invention or discovery in the arts,
confers upon the patentee an exclusive property in the patented invention which cannot be appropriated or used by the
government itself, without just compensation, any more than
it can appropriate or use without compensation land which has
been patented to a private purchaser, we have no doubt. The
Constitution gives to Congress power "to promote the progress
of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective
writings and discoveries," which could not be effected if the
government had a reserved right to publish such writings or to
use such inventions without the consent of the owner. Many
inventions relate to subjects which can only be properly used
by the government, such as explosive shells, rams, and submarine batteries to be attached to armed vessels. If it could use
such inventions without compensation, the inventors could get
no return at all for their discoveries and experiments. It has
been the general practice, when inventions have been made
which are desirable for government use, either for the government to purchase them from the inventors, and use them as
secrets of the proper department; or, if a patent is granted,
to pay the patentee a fair compensation for their use. The
United States has no such prerogative as that which is claimed
by the sovereigns of England, by which it can reserve to itself,
either expressly or by implication, a superior dominion and
use in that which it grants by letters-patent to those who
entitle themselves to such grants. The government of the
United States, as well as the citizen, is subject to the Constitution ; and when it grants a patent the grantee is entitled to
it as a matter of right, and does not receive it, as was originally supposed to be the case in England, as a matter of grace
and favor.
But the mode of obtaining compensation from the United
States for the use of an invention, where such use has not been
by the consent of the patentee, has never been specifically provided for by any statute. The most proper forum for such a
claim is the Court of Claims, if that court has the requisite
jurisdiction. As its jurisdiction does not extend to torts, there
might be some difficulty, as the law now stands, in prosecuting

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

in that court a claim for the unauthorized use of a patented
invention; although where the tort is waived, and the claim
is placed upon the footing of an implied contract, we understand that the court has in several recent instances entertained
the jurisdiction. It is true, it overruled such a claim on the
original patent in this case, presented in 1867; but, according
to more recent holdings, it would properly now take cognizance of the case. The question of its jurisdiction has never
been presented for the consideration of this court, and it would
be premature for us to determine it now. If the jurisdiction
of the Court of Claims should not be finally sustained, the only
remedy against the United States, until Congress enlarges the
jurisdiction of that court, would be to apply to Congress itself.
The course adopted in the present case, of instituting an action
against a public officer, who acts only for and in behalf of the
government, is open to serious objections. We doubt very
much whether such an action can be sustained. It is substantially a suit against the United States itself, which cannot be
maintained under the guise of a suit against its officers and
agents except in the manner provided by law. We have heretofore expressed our views on this subject in Carr v. United
States (98 U. S. 433), where a judgment in ejectment against
a government agent was held to be no estoppel against the
government itself.
But as the conclusion which we have reached in this case
does not render it necessary to decide this question, we reserve
our judgment upon it for a more fitting occasion.
The subject-matter of the patent on which the bill in this
case was founded is an implement or stamp for postmarking
letters and cancelling revenue and postage stamps. The original patent, dated April 14, 1863, exhibited two stamps connected together by a cross-bar which was attached to a handle;
one stamp being intended for printing the post-mark, and the
other for cancelling the postage-stamp,- both operations being
performed by a single blow. The stamps consisted of small
hollow blocks, or cylinders, in which were inserted and
fastened the types which produced the impressions desired.
In one were placed the lettered types which produced the
post-mark, and in the other a single type which blotted or

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

cancelled the postage-stamp. The patentee, in his specification, described the invention as follows: "The nature of my improvements, herein described, consists in
the employment and combination of a device for cancelling postage or other stamps by means of wood, cork, or similar material
inserted in a tube or recess therein, for the purpose of effacing or
blotting such stamps with indelible ink. It also consists in the
combination of a cancelling device, having wood, cork, rubber, or
any similar material for the type or blotter therein, with any postmarking device so as to blot, cancel, or efface postage-stamps with
indelible ink at the same time and operation of post-marking of
letters, packets, &c., &c.
"To enable others skilled in the art to which my invention relates to make and use the same, I will here proceed to describe the
construction and operation thereof, which is as follows, to wit: I
construct the post-marking stamp (D) of any suitable material.
(E),Fig. 3, is the mortice or recess of suitable dimensions to receive
the type for the month, the day of the month, and the year, around
which is the name of the place where used, and is the same as the
postmarking device described in my letters-patent, bearing date the
sixteenth day of December, 1862, and which is secured to the crosspiece (B) in the same manner and by the same means as described
and set forth in the said patent, which is also the case with the
cancelling device (C).
"I construct the cancelling stamp or device (C) of any suitable
material, of any size required in diameter, and in length to correspond to the postmarking device (D). (F), Fig. 3, is the tube or
recess in the device (C) for the purpose of receiving the blotting
or cancelling device (G), Figs. 2 and 5, which device is made of
wood, cork, rubber, or similar material, so as to closely fit the said
tube or recess (F), Fig. 3. The face of this device may contain a
plan or form for cancelling with indelible ink, like that shown at
Fig. 2, or it may have any plan or form for that purpose thought
best to devise or use. This device (G) may project somewhat
below the lower end of the said tube (F), as seen at Fig. 5, and
may also project below the face of the postmarking or rating device
(D), Figs. 2 and 3, and it may be driven out of the said tube or recess by means of a pin or bolt operating through the hole (A), Figs.
3 and 5, for the purpose of repairs, or to replace it by a new one.
The said tube or recess (G) may be any size in diameter required
or any depth desired. The said cancelling stamp or device (C)

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

being thus constructed with cork, rubber, or other elastic substance
for type or blotter, will receive and hold on the face thereof ink in
quantities sufficient to blot or cancel the postage-stamp in such
manner as to prevent the possibility of the said postage-stamp
being cleansed of the cancelling ink by any chemical or other process, for the said ink would be so effectually put thereon that any
attempts to remove it therefrom would entirely destroy the said
postage-stamp, and thereby render the same incapable of a second
or re-use. The said cork, rubber, or other elastic substance, as
aforesaid, will render the said stamp capable of an easy and rapid
use, tbr there being a yielding of the same when the blow is given,
the operator will not tire as soon by a constant or continued use
of the same as though it were of solid metal, and the same will
greatly aid in raising the entire stamp from the paper and postagestamp when the impression shall have been given by the operator.
The said blotter or type can be more easily repaired or replaced by
a new one at less expense than if made of solid metal. The said
cork, rubber, or other elastic material may extend upward to the
said cross-bar (B), and there be connected to the same by a screw
or pin-bolt, if desired, which will be the same in effect and in
operation.
" Having thus described my invention and improvements in
marking and cancelling stamps, what I claim and desire to secure
by letters-patent of the United States of America, therein, is: " 1. The cancelling device (C) with wood, cork, or rubber type
or blotter (G) therein, or any device substantially the same, so as
to cancel the postage-stamp with indelible ink, substantially as
herein described and set forth.
" 2. I also claim the cancelling device (C) with wood, cork, or
similar material forming the type or blotter (G) therein, in combination with the cross-piece (B), and with the postmarking device
(D) substantially as herein described and set forth."
We have given the description and claim in full for the
purpose of better comparing it with the reissued patent on
which the suit was brought, and which is dated Oct. 4, 1870.
It will be seen that the invention claimed is very specific and
definite in its character. In the first place, the cancelling device is claimed separately, consisting of a hollow tube, in which
is inserted the cancelling type or blotter made of wood, cork,
rubber, or other elastic substance. The nature of the substance of which the blotter was to be made is emphasized thus:

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

"The said cork, rubber, or other elastic substance as aforesaid
will render the said stamp capable of an easy and rapid use,
for there being a yielding of the same when the blow is given,
the operator will not tire as soon by a constant or continued
use of the same as though it were of solid metal, and the same
will greatly aid in raising the entire stamp from the paper
and postage-stamp when the impression shall have been given
by the operator. The said blotter or type can be more easily
repaired or replaced by a new one, at less expense than if made
of solid metal." It is plain, therefore, that elasticity in the
material of which the blotter was to be composed was a distinctive feature of the blotting device thus separately claimed.
Besides the advantages referred to in the foregoing extracts,
its superior adaptability to hold indelible ink was evidently
regarded by the inventor as important. From the facts appearing in the case, it is quite clear that a separate claim of
this blotting device could not have been sustained had it not
presented these special characteristics ; had it not, in fact, contained all the elements it did contain. The patentee himself,
as will be more fully seen hereafter, had, shortly before his application for this patent, obtained a patent for a double stamp
exactly like the one patented in this, except that the blotter
'type was made of " steel, or other material which would answer the purpose." Of course he could not claim a blotter of
like material in the patent now under consideration. And the
record is full of evidence to show that hand-types for stamping
letters and other characters with or without the use of ink had
long been constructed of almost every kind of material. The
general form of the instrument was old. Stamps fastened to
what is called a brad-awl handle, adjusted thereto centrally, so
as to balance the pressure, was used for seals and other instruments for making impressions of every sort from time immemorial ; and hand-stamps of the same general description, having
a cylindrical type-holder in place of a seal, made hollow for inserting and holding the type, had long been used in the PostOffice Department. It was not without good cause, therefore,
that the separate claim for the cancelling device, as a distinct
invention, was confined to an elastic type or blotter enclosed in
a hollow tube. In like manner, the combination of devices in

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

the entire instrument, forming the subject of the second claim,
was necessarily specific in its character, being restricted by the
special construction of the cancelling device. The specific form
of a cross-bar to sustain the type-holder, and balance the effect
of the blow or pressure when making the impression, was substanrtially contained in the common hand-type, long before used
for printing names on linen with indelible ink. This instrument consisted of a metallic trough or receiver to hold the type,
the bottom of which, at its middle part, was attached to a
wooden brad-awl handle. Inserting the types for a post-mark
in one end of this device, and the type for blotting the postagestamp in the other, it would be a complete double stamp like
that claimed by Norton, the patentee. The fact that it might
require a stronger piece of metal for post-office uses than was
required for stamping letters on cloth, or that the type-holder
would be better adapted to the purpose by being divided into
two compartments, does not detract from the substantial simiGiven the idea of stamping the
larity of the instruments.
post-mark and blotting the postage-stamp with one instrument
at a single blow, it required but little invention, in view of
what was then in common use, to adjust the printing apparatus
to the handle by means of a block, shoulder, or cross-bar, or
other similar device. The needs and requirements of the instrument would soon be developed, and manifest themselves to
any skilled workman in that branch of mechanics.
The evidence does not show to our satisfaction that Norton
was by any means the first inventor of a double post-offico stamp,
so constructed as to make the post-mark and cancel .the postagestamp at one blow. If that fact was important, the burden of
proof was on the complainant to show that Norton's invention
antedated those of others proven in the cause, of which there
were several independent of each other. But there is no satisfactory proof that Norton ever produced, prior to 1862, or, at
most, prior to 1861, any other double stamp than one which lie
patented in 1859. In connection with one C. A. Haskins, he
obtained a patent in October, 1857, for a hand-stamp attached
to a standard with a projecting arm, and provided with a spring
to lift it from the paper automatically, after the blow which
made the impression was given. This stamp was an elaborate

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

and complicated contrivance of wheels and cylinders for arranging and manipulating the types for making letters and figures
showing the month and day of the month in the post-mark. It
had no hint of any secondary apparatus for effacing a postagestamp at the same time. But in August, 1859, Norton obtained a patent for the use of his assignees, Reynolds and Low,
which did contain a device for effacing the postage-stamp.
Low seems to have been associated with him in the patent of
1857 in the way of furnishing money, but what was the nature
or extent of the assignees' real interest in the patent of 1859 is
not made to appear. The application for this patent was dated
May 3, 1859, but when filed in the Patent Office is not shown.
The principal feature of the stamp described in this patent was
also an elaborately contrived device for arranging the types for
the letters and figures in the postmarking stamp, something
in the same line with that described in the patent of 1857 ; no
claim for which, however, was allowed. But to the postmarking stamp, which was fixed to the handle in the ordinary way,
was attached, on one side, entirely outside of the bearing of the
handle, a flat piece of metal to be used as a blotter, for which, in
combination with the postmarking stamp, a claim was allowed.
It is clear to us that this was the stamp to which Norton
alluded, and which he asked to have the privilege of testing in
the post-office at Troy, in his letter to the Assistant Postmaster-General of the 11th of April, 1859, on which much stress
has been laid by the complainants. The letter does not give a
description of the stamp he wished to test, but it concludes
with these words : " I herewith enclose you an envelope containing a post-mark from the stamp on the left, and an erasure
upon the stamp made at the same operation of post-mark. As
now constructed, is believed to work well." This is a clear
intimation that what he desired to have tested had been recently brought to its existing form. In a former part of the
letter lie had said: " While the order given by your department was in force, I was unable, in consequence of sickness,
to thoroughly test my stamp. It was used upon about three
thousand letters only during that time. I have since made
some changes in it which seem to make it a much better thing
for the purpose designed. Now I ask the opportunity to test

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

"

it without any expense to the government." An order was
made by Mr. King, the Assistant Postmaster-General, on the
4th of May, 1859, authorizing the postmaster at Troy to use
for postmarking letters at his office for the term of three
months " Norton's improved marking stamp." The application for the patent had been prepared and sworn to the day
previous to this order, namely, May 3, 1859. In this application the description of the invention commences thus : " The nature of my invention consists in constructing, combining, and arranging a hand-stamp, hereinafter described, so as to con.
tain a cylinder with the initials of each and every month in a year,
and two other cylinders with figures for the respective days of each
and every month; also a cylinder with figures to represent ten
years, more or less as the case may be, which cylinders shall revolve upon the same shaft with each, and within a stationary form
of type, and thereby print the month, the day of the month, and
the year in connection with each, and each in connection with and
at the same time of the printing of the subject-matter upon the
aforesaid stationary form of type. It also consists in attaching a
blotter, hereinafter described, to the hand-stamp aforesaid, upon
one or two sides thereof, for the purpose of cutting, blotting, cancelling, or effacing 'the frank' or postage-stamp, so as to prevent
a second use of the same, while at the same time the'-name of the
'post-office,' the year, the month, and the day of the month is
printed upon the envelope and one side of the said frank or postage-stamp, thereby giving a good impression of the same, and prevent undue wear of the said postmarking-stamp in consequence of
being used upon the uneven surface made by the said frank or
postage-stamp."
Now, if Norton had, as he pretends, invented, as early as
1854, the stamps for which he took out his subsequent patents
in 1862 and 1863, it is hardly conceivable that he should have
taken out the patents for 1857 and 1859 in the form in which
they stand. The fact that he did take them out reduces it
almost to a demonstration that he had not invented any such
stamps at this time.
It is true he produces a caveat filed by him in 1853, which
has, or had, an amendment bearing date " Tinmouth, Vt., Aug.
7, 1854," which amendment contained a full description of

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

the double stamp as finally exhibited in his patent of 1863,
and the reissue thereof. But this amendment was shown to
have been surreptitiously introduced by him amongst the
papers of the office certainly as late as 1864, ten years after its
pretended date. In his examination as a witness in this cause
he admitted that he made the paper referred to in the summer
of 1864, when his assignees, Shavor and Corse, were applying
for a reissue of the original patent now in question, and that
it was used in that application ; but he pretends that it was
a copy of a paper which he made and sent to the Patent
Office in 1854. No such original paper, however, has ever
been found in the Patent Office, and on a regular charge for
the offence of making the surreptitious paper and introducing
it amongst the files, he was found guilty in September, 1871,
and debarred, by order of the Commissioner of Patents, from
further access to the papers of the office.
This amendment caveat, therefore, as well as the testimony
of Norton on the subject, may be laid out of view.
A witness by the name of Sherwood, a machinist and modelmaker, was examined, who produced a sheet or two of items of
account, copied from his books, showing charges against Norton for work on " stamps" in 1857, 1859, 1860, and 1862.
There were four items in 1857 under date of May, for certain
hours of work, charged thus: "May 8. To three hours, finish
stamp." There was a large number of items of similar character in the other years named, particularly in January and
March, 1859, and August, September, November, and December, 1862, corresponding, as will be observed, with the times
when Norton must have been getting up his models for his
different patents. The witness was unable to distinguish the
kind of stamps he worked on at these different dates, except
that he professed to feel quite sure that the first one would
postmark a letter and cancel a stamp thereon at the same time.
Describing, on his cross-examination, the stamp which he thus
referred to, he says : " It was a dating wheel stamp, the wheels
giving the dates, with a die for the office and year in the top
of the frame that held it, blotting or cancelling at one end the
impression given by a blow on the lever by the hand." Now
this description applies aptly to both the stamp patented in

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

1857 and to that patented in 1859, except that it was the
latter only which had the blotting attachment. We think it
perfectly apparent that the witness had, by a very natural
mental process, confounded the instruments together, and
imagined that the blotter was attached to the first instead of
the second invention. His examination took place twenty years
after the date of the accounts, and he relied solely on his memory as to the character of the articles which he worked upon.
This is really the strongest evidence that can be found
in
the record affording any ground for the conclusion that Norton ever produced any double stamp at all prior to the one he
patented in 1859. The testimony of Mr. King, the former
Assistant Postmaster-General, when compared with his own
contemporary letters and other circumstances, clearly indicates that he had, quite naturally, confounded the device of
one date with that of a later date. Other evidence was relied on, bat all of such a loose and indefinite character that no
reliance can be placed on it in support of the complainant's
theory. And it is quite significant that no stamp of the kind
claimed, made at the period in question, was produced in the
examination. Had such stamps ever been in existence, it is
strange that they should have altogether disappeared.
Now, there is abundant evidence in the record to show that
double stamps were conceived of and used before 1859, and
that about that time they sprung up spontaneously in various
parts of the country. It was but recently that there had been
any demand for their construction, since postage-stamps had
not been in general use in the country for any long period.
They were first authorized to be issued and used by the act of
March 3, 1847 c. 63 (9 Stat. 188) ; but it was optional to use
them or not. By the act of March 3, 1851, c. 20, postage on
single letters was reduced from five cents to three on being
prepaid. 9 Stat. 587. It was not till the passage of the act
of March 3, 1855, c. 173, that all postage, except on letters to
or from a foreign country, was required to be prepaid. This
law first brought postage-stamps into universal use; and, as
they must be cancelled, two impressions had to be made on a
letter, - one for the ordinary post-mark, giving the place and
date of mailing the letter; the other for cancelling or effacing

368

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

the postage-stamp. This required two blows and produced
double work. But without any great exercise of ingenuity,
postmasters and clerks in various places improvised double
stamps, generally by screwing, welding, or binding to the side
of the common stamp an appendage to serve as a blotter at the
same time. This was done by Ezra Miller, at Janesville, Wisconsin, as early as January, 1859, or in 1858; and by General
Dix in New York, and one Powers in Buffalo, in the summer of
1860. There is also evidence that a similar appendage for the
purpose of stamping a large figure 5, to show the postage due,
was invented and used by one Rees iii the Philadelphia postoffice as early as 1845, when the rates of postage were five and
ten cents; and that one Ireland devised and used at the same
office a like appendage for cancelling postage-stamps as early
as 1853. Other similar devices were referred to in the evidence. The adoption of a more artistic and convenient form
of the instrument thus spontaneously originated, as its use
was continued and became more imperative, was a matter of
course. Norton's particular form and construction of the
double stamp, as described in his patent of 1863, was undoubtedly an improvement; but we should expect to find, as we do
find, that lie was restricted in his claim to the particular form
and construction set forth in his specification.
A reference to Norton's application for the original patent
in question in this case, a copy of which is in evidence, and
which, being preserved of record in the Patent Office, may
properly be referred to, shows that the functionaries of that
office regarded it important that the instrument sought to be
patented should be specialized with particularity. This application was presented to the office on the 5th of January, 1863, and
was rejected on the 21st of February. On the 21st of March,
1863, the application was renewed in a letter addressed by
Norton to the Commissioner of Patents, and after certain
amendments were made to the specification, the patent was
allowed to pass. The most important amendment was the
insertion of that portion of the specification commencing with
the words, "The said cancelling stamp or device (C) being
thus constructed with cork, rubber, or other elastic substance
for type or blotter," and so on, to the end of the paragraph.

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

This amendment derives further importance and illustration
from the letter of Norton above referred to, in which a renewal
of the application was made, and which was dated at the National Hotel, in Washington, March 21, 1863. In that letter
the writer says: "I do not understand that the device referred to in your
letter of the 21st of February last is ' a common ink cancelling
stamp, such as has been used for years in our post-offices for
blotting and thus cancelling post-office stamps.' The devices
to which you undoubtedly refer have always been made of
metal entirely or of wood entirely. Wood was found to answer no purpose, because not at all durable, so metal ones were
used. Now this device consists of a barrel or tube, into which
wood, cork, rubber, or some such material is inserted, for the
purpose of holding an indelible ink in quantities sufficient to blot
the postage-stamp so thoroughly as to prevent the same being
washed or cleansed by a chemical mixture and again being
used in payment of postage. This tube or barrel holds firmly
the elastic substance therein, and prevents the same from undue
wear and exposure. The elastic substance therein being worn
out, can again be replaced at the office where used, thus saving
the trouble and expense of returning the same to the gov't
contractors for such repairs. Thi, therefore, constitutes a new
device, composed of two distinct parts in combination, producing new results, besides blotting the postage-stamp.
" This device being new, its combination with the postmarking device for the purposes set forth in the specification is of
course new. Upon these two claims I, therefore, most respectfully ask a patent."
On the same day that this letter was received, according to
the memorandum on the file-wrapper, the specification was
returned to the applicant to enable him to amend it, and was
re-examined on the 26th of March, and favorably passed upon
on the 1st of April. No one can read the patent in the light
of these contemporary documents, and of the previous history
of the stamp, without arriving at the conclusion that, so far as
the blotting device was separately concerned, the invention
consisted of, and was confined to, a tube containing a typeblotter made of an elastic substance, as contradistinguished

from iron or other hard substance. The iron or steel blotter
had been patented in 1862, as already mentioned, and as will
be shown more fully hereafter. There was not, there could
not have been, any inadvertence or mistake in confining
the invention to the combination described and claimed in
the patent.
The second claim is merely that of a combination of this
specific device with the other parts of the apparatus. As the
patentee says, in his letter to the commissioner, " This device
being new, its combination with the postmarking device for
the purposes set forth in the application is of course new."
In other words, the substantive invention, for which the applicant desired a patent, was the blotting device constructed
specifically in the manner and for the purpose described. The
addition of the combination claim was for the purpose of possibly securing the combination, if the principal claim should
be found to be untenable.
Perhaps we have gone more minutely into the evidence
relating to the progressive improvements in this instrument
than was necessary to show that the claim of the patent was
not more restricted than it should have been. The court
ought not to be called upon to explore the entire history of
an art in order to ascertain what a patentee might have included in his patent had he been so disposed. If he was the
author of any other invention than that which he specifically
describes and claims, though he might have asked to have it
patented at the same time, and in the same patent, yet if lie has
not done so, and afterwards desires to secure it, he is bound to
make a new and distinct application for that purpose, and make
it the subject of a new and different patent. When a patent
fully and clearly, without ambiguity or obscurity, describes
and claims a specific invention, complete in itself, so that it
cannot be said to be inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, a reissue cannot be had for
the purpose of expanding and generalizing the claim so as to
make it embrace an invention not described and specified in
the original. It is difficult to express the law on this subject
more aptly and forcibly than in the words of Mr. Justice Grier,
in the case of Burr v. Duryee (1 Wall. 531), where, in deliv-

ering the unanimous opinion of the court, he says: "The surrender of valid patents, and the granting of reissued patents
thereon, with expanded or equivocal claims, when the original
was clearly neither ' inoperative nor invalid,' and whose specification is neither ' defective nor insufficient,' is a great abuse of
the privilege granted by the statute, and productive of great
injury to the public. This privilege was not given to the
patentee or his assignee in order that the patent may be rendered more elastic or expansive, and, therefore, more 'available' for the suppression of all other inventions." Of course,
if, by actual inadvertence, accident, or mistake, innocently
committed, the claim does not fully assert or define the patentee's right in the invention specified in the patent, a speedy
application for its correction, before adverse rights have accrued, may be granted, as we have explained in the recent case
of Miller v. Brass Company, supra, p. 350. But where it is
apparent on the face of the patent, or by contemporary records,
that no such inadvertence, accident, or mistake, as claimed in a
reissue of it, could have occurred, an expansion of the claim
cannot be allowed or sustained.
Turning now to the reissued patent on which the present
suit was brought, which is the third reissue, dated Oct. 4,
1870, we find the invention described as follows: "The nature of my said invention and improvements herein contained and described consists in the employment and combination
of a device or die used for the more complete and perfect cancellation of postage-stamps or letter-franks by means of soft wood used
endwise, or of cork, rubber, or other suitable material, whereby
such stalnp or frank is effaced and cancelled, in and by indelible
or other ink, in the manner substantially as herein described and
set forth.
"It also consists in the combination of a postage-stamp cancelling device or die, constructed of wood, cork, rubber, or any suitable
material,with any suitably arranged and constructed postmarking
stamp or device, so as to cancel, efface, or destroy the postage-stamp
or letter-frank with indelible or any suitable ink at the same time,
blow, or operation of the stamp or instrument by which the postmark is given or made upon the letter, envelope, or packet, substantially as herein described and set forth.

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

"It also consists of the postmarking of letters, envelopes, or
packets, and in the cancellation of the postage stamp or stamps
thereon, with, in, or by any suitable ink, or similar material, by
means of some soft wood used endwise against the postage-stamp,
or by the means of cork, rubber, iron, or steel, or by means of any
other suitable material so combined with the postmarking stamp
or instrument as to cancel, efface, or destroy the postage stamp or
stamps at one and the same blow or operation of the entire instrument thus constructed for that purpose, whereby to prevent a
second or re-use of such postage stamp or stamps."
After some details as to the mode of construction, the specification proceeds: " The said cancelling type or die can be easily repaired, or replaced by a new one, whenever desired, and at very little expense;
and such cancelling die or type G may extend upward to the said
cross-bar B, and there be connected to the same by means of a
screw, pin, or small bolt. In such case there would not be any tube
or pipe surrounding said cancelling die or type G. The operation and effect produced would in such case of construction be the
samle.
"The said postage-stamp cancelling device, die, or type G may
be of any desired distance from the aforesaid postmarking or
dating device or stamp D, or it may be securely fastened to the
immediate side of the said postmarking and dating part or stamp
or device D by any convenient and suitable mechanical means.
"The said cancelling die, type, or device G I prefer to use made
of cork, as it will hold a much greater quantity of cancelling ink
upon and in the lower face thereof, and when it comes in contact
with the printed surface of the postage-stamp, such surface will
become somewhat and sufficiently broken by means thereof, and
thus and thereby inject into or impregnate such broken surface
with the said cancelling ink, whereby such postage-stamp, so
operated upon and filled with such ink, cannot be sufficiently
cleansed by any means as to enable it to be reused, or used a
second time, in fraud upon the postal revenue, without immediate
detection of the same.
"Soft wood, used endwise, will answer nearly the same purpose. Still, long and continued use aftar the granting of my said
patent, April 14, 1863, has fully proven the superiority of the cork
for the cancelling die or type used upon postage-stamps as aforesaid. ...

JAMES v. CAMPBELL.

"I also construct my said postage-stamp cancelling device, die,
or type of cast iron, steel, or other suitable metal, substantially as
shown at GI, Figs. 5 and 6, and which may be secured to the said
cross-bar or piece B in like manner as the said tube or cylinder C,
Figs. 2 and 4, and which is done either by screw and nut where
the same unites with the said cross-bar, or it may there be firmly
fastened by means of suitably constructed and arranged pins or
rivets, or the same may be soldered to the under side of said crossbay or piece B, or otherwise attached thereto ...
"The aforesaid metal cancelling device, die, or type G', Figs.
5 and 6, may also be f1stened or secured to the immediate side of
the said postmarking device by any good and sufficient means,
substantially as hereinbefore described and set forth, in reference
to the said device C, or tube or cylinder, constructed to receive
and contain the said type or die G, Figs. 2, 3, and 4.
"Such metallic device, die, or type may also have upon its lower
fi ce or lower surface any suitable configuration deemed best to use
for the purpose of cancelling the postage-stamp in, with, or by any
suitable ink at the same time, blow, and operation of the instrument
or apparatus, as hereinbefbre stated and set forth.
"In any and every case the postmarking of the letter, envelope,
or packet, and the effacing or cancellation of the postage-stamp or
letter-frank thereon representing value, are done at the same time
and by the same blow or operation of the said several devices and
parts, constructed and combined in the manner and by the means
substantially as herein described and set forth.
"Both the postmarking and cancellation of the said postagestamp are done with indelible or other and suitable ink, used for
such cancellation or effacing of the postage-stamp."
Omitting much more of this verbose specification, containing, amongst other things, a dissertation on the supposed advantages and importance of the invention, we add the summary
of the patentee's claims, which is as follows: " What I claim, and desire to secure by letters-patent of the
United States of America, is " 1. The postage-stamp cancelling device, cylinder, or tube C,
containing a die or type, G, made of cork, wood, or other suitable
material, or any equivalentfor said cylinder or tube C, or for the
said cancelling die or type G, whereby to efface, cancel, or destroy
the postage-stamp with indelible or other ink, in the manner and
for the purposes substantially as herein described and set forth.

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

"2. The cancelling device, cylinder, or tube C, with cork or
wood, or any substantial equivalent thereof, forming the die or

type G, therein, in combination with the cross-bar or piece B, and
with the postmarking device D, substantially as and for the purposes herein described and set forth.
" 3. The postmarcing of letters, envelopes, andpackets, and the
cancellation of the postage-stamps thereon with ink, at one and

the same blow or operation of the instrument, in the manner and
by the means substantially as herein described and set forth.
"4. Te ernployment and combination of a postmarking device,
with a postage-stamp cancelling device, both being operated by one

and the same handle, for the postmarking of letters, envelopes, or
packets, and for the cancellation of the postage-stamps thereon
with indelible or other ink, in the manner substantially as herein
described and set forth."
By these extracts from the specification, and the summary
of claims, it appears perfectly obvious that the patentee has
embraced in the reissued patent several matters of supposed
invention different from and additional to the invention which
formed the subject of the original patent. And it is principally, if not wholly, these new and additional claims which the
appellant James, as postmaster of New York, is charged with
infringing.
In the first place, a new form of the cancelling device is set
forth and claimed, different from that described in the original
patent, to wit, a cancelling type or die attached directly to the
cross-bar, without any tube or pipe surrounding and holding
the same. This is not contemplated or hinted at in the original
patent. The latter does suggest, it is true, that "the cork,
rubber, or other elastic material may extend upward to the
cross-bar, and there be connected to the same by a screw or
pin-bolt, if desired ; " but this suggestion had reference to a
type enclosed, at the same time, by a surrounding cylinder,
which formed the distinctive feature of the invention. The
context shows that nothing more was intended by the suggestion than the extension of the type upward through the cylinder and fastening it in a particular way. The thought seems
to have occurred to the patentee that it might be an advantage, under some circumstances, in addition to fastening the

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

type in the cylinder by compression, to extend it through the
cylinder and fasten it to the bar to secure it from any danger
of falling out of the cylinder by becoming loose. Not a hint
was given that the cylinder could be dispensed with. This
was an after-thought. The cylinder was clearly and distinctly
set forth as a necessary constituent of the device, and an essential element in the combination of which the blotting device
consisted.
The bearing which this new feature in the reissued patent
has on the case is evinced by the fact that one of the devices
used for several years in the post-office, which is complained
of as an infringment of the patent, was a naked blotter made
of cork, directly attached to the cross-bar, without any enclosing cylinder to support it; also by the fact that the other
device used in the post-office during the defendant's term of
office consisted of an iron blotter directly attached to the side
of the postmarking stamp without any enclosing cylinder.
In our judgment, this addition to the patent was no part of
the original invention, and could not lawfully be embraced in
the reissue, and that the claim for it is therefore void. It is
true that this particular feature is not made the subject of
a distinct claim. But it is described as part of the invention,
and would probably be included in the general and sweeping
terms employed in the claims that are made. Regarded as not
being a part of the original invention, those claims cannot
stand if they are construed to include it: if they are construed
so as not to include it, then the use of this form of device
by the defendant cannot be adjudged an infringement of the
patent.
Another new matter, forming no part of the original invention, but expressly disclaimed in the original patent, is the
making of the blotter of cast iron, steel, or other suitable
material. The original specification, in various forms of expression, excludes such materials. The words " wood, cork,
rubber, or any similar materials" have this intention, as shown
by the context. A claimed advantage is that "the said cork,
rubber, or other elastic substance, as aforesaid, will render the
said stamp capable of an easy and rapid use; for there being a
yielding of the same when the blow is given, the operator will

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

not tire as soon by a constant or continued use of the same as
though it were of solid metal. The said blotter or type can be
more easily repaired or replaced by a new one, at less expense,
than if made of solid metal." This language amounts to an
express disclaimer of solid metal. The merit claimed for the
invention was that the elastic materials proposed to be used for
the blotter, and the use of which the patent throughout supposes possible by the support received from the surrounding
cylinder, were far superior to solid metal and other solid and
inelastic substances. How, after this, it could be supposed that
the use of solid metal as a material for the type-blotter was
included in the invention, and that a claim for it was omitted
through inadvertence and mistake, it is difficult to understand.
Besides, as already seen, and will be again adverted to, the use
of steel or other material that would answer the purpose had
already been described and claimed in Norton's patent of 1862.
We think that any claim in the reissued patent which can be
fairly construed to embrace a blotter made of metal is void,
and that the use of such a blotter by the defendant did not
afford the patentee or the complainant any just ground of
complaint.
In connection with this branch of the subject, it is observable that the patentee has added two new diagrams to his
drawings for the purpose of exhibiting and illustrating this
i.ew ground of claim. This fact, though not decisive, is
strongly corroborative of the conclusion which we have
reached on the subject.
The third addition in the reissued patent to the invention
described in the original is that of the process of stamping
letters with a post-mark and cancelling the postage-stamp, at
one and the same blow or operation of the instrument, in the
manner and by the means described and set forth. Leaving
out of view the history of the art prior to the invention
claimed by the patentee, what possible pretence can there be
for contending that the general process was part of the invention which formed the subject of the original patent? Suppose it be true that Norton was the first inventor of this process, was that process the invention which he sought to secure
in the original patent? A patent for a process and a patent

for an implement or a machine are very different things.
Powder Company v. Powder Works, 98 U. S. 126. Where
a new process. produces a new substance, the invention of the
process is the same as the invention of the substance, and a
patent for the one may be reissued so as to include both, as
was done in the case of Goodyear's vulcanized-rubber patent.
But a process, and a machine for applying the process, are not
necessarily one and the same invention. They are generally
distinct and different. The process or act of making a postmark and cancelling a postage-stamp by a single blow or operation, as a subject of invention, is a totally different thing in
the patent law from a stamp constructed for performing that
process. The claim of the process in the present case, however, is not so broad as this. It is for the process or act of
stamping letters with a post-mark and cancelling the postagestamp at one and the same blow or operation of the instrument, in the manner and by the means described and set forth.
Perhaps this claim amounts to no more than a claim to the
exclusive use of the patented instrument or device. If it is
anything more, it is for a different invention from that described in the original patent. If it is not for anything more,
the question is brought back to the instrument or device itself
which forms the subject of the patent, and which has been
already considered.
The last claim, to wit, "the employmentand combination of
a postmarking device with a postage-stamp cancelling device,
both being operated by one and the same handle, for the postmarking of letters, envelopes, or packets, and for the cancellation of the postage-stamps thereon with indelible or other ink,
in the manner substantially as herein described and set forth,"
may admit of two' constructions. It may either amount to a
claim for a combination of any kind of devices for stamping
and blotting, or for a combination of the particular devices
described in the patent. Inasmuch as these specified devices,
as we have already shown, embrace new devices not described
in the original patent, the claim is too broad in either of its
aspects to be advanced in a reissue of that patent, unless the
patentee was really the inventor of the general combination
of such devices in a double stamp, and was entitled to add a

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

claim therefor to such reissue. We have seen that his original
patent was for a specific blotting device, and for the combination of such specific device with a post-stamping device in the
same instrument. Could he, in a reissue of the patent, lawfully make the broad claim of the combination of any and all
devices for blotting and post-stamping, at one and the same
time, in one and the same instrument ? This would be, it is
true, only adding a new claim to his patent, but greatly enlarging its scope and making it to embrace every kind of
double stamp that can be conceived. Did he forget to insert
this claim in his original patent ? Was it omitted through
accident and mistake ? When we examine his original application, the changes it underwent, the careful exclusions as well
as inclusions which it contained, and the particularity of the
specific combination which he did claim, could he, after the
lapse of more than a year (if we take the date of his first
application for a reissue as the time for consideration), be allowed to return to the Patent Office and pretend that he had
inadvertently omitted the principal claim of the whole thing?
If he was, or pretended to be, really the inventor of the entire
double stamp, did not the patent, on its face, show that the
invention was not secured to him, - that it contained no such
claim? And was not this omission obvious on inspection?
The truth is, that when he made his original application, and
got his original patent, all the documents show demonstrably
that he did not intend it to embrace any such broad invention.
That was not the invention he sought to secure. Having obtained a patent for his specific device and combination, if lie
afterwards wished to claim the general combination, and had
not already abandoned it by taking a narrower patent, he was
bound to make a new application for that purpose. Patentees
avoid doing this when they can, and seek to embrace additional
matters in a reissue, in order to supersede and get possession of
the rights which the public, by lapse of time or other cause, have
acquired in the mean time. It is for this very reason that the
law does not allow them to take a reissue for anything but the
same invention described and claimed in the original patent.
But these broad claims in the reissued patent, if construed
according to the latitude in which they are expressed, are void

JAiES V. CAIPBELL.

by reason of embracing inventions which had been patented
both in England and in this country prior to the patentee's
application for the original patent.
A stamp with a postmarking device and a blotting device
combined in one instrument was described in an English
patent, dated April 24, 1860, granted to one David G. Berri.
As shown in the drawing, the postmarker and blotter were
attached to one metallic plate, analogous and equivalent to the
cross-bar described in Norton's patent, to the centre of which
plate the handle was attached, so that the instrument was
equally balanced. The particular object of the patent was to
secure a method of hinging the plate containing the types on to
the fixed plate to facilitate the insertion and change of the
types. But the double stamp is fully exhibited; and the patentee, in the specification, says: " In conclusion to the foregoing description, it may be here necessary to note that my
improved date-stamp may be employed, either in connection
with the double or obliterating mark, as represented, or separately, in conformity with the usual requirements."
The same combination of postmarker and blotter in one instrument was also exhibited in Norton's own patent of Aug.*
9, 1859. As he did not then reserve the process of stamping
letters with such an instrument, nor the combination of a postmarker and a blotter, and did not make any simultaneous
application therefor, he could not afterwards obtain a patent
for such process and combination, but would be restricted to
such particular combination or process as might be exhibited
in a new device or apparatus.
We have already referred to this patent of 1859, and will
here only quote from the specification, to show the construction
of the stamp, and the scope which the 'patentee claimed his
invention to possess. He says :" The blotter (J) is fastened to the frame (B) upon one side thereof
by the use of the shaft (D), one end of which passes througi the upper part of the said blotter, and which is firmly secured to the said
fi'ame by means of the nut (E), or by using it for the nut in place
of the said nut (E) as aforesaid. This blotter is then and thereby
retained in a fixed and strong position by means of the screw (S)
in connection with the said shaft (D), the blotter (J) or nut (E),

[Sup. Ct.

and is for the purpose of cutting, inking, blotting, effacing, and
effectually cancelling the frank or postage-stamp, while, at the same
time and operation, the name of the post-office, the year, the month,
and the day thereof are given upon the envelope or letter at one
side of the said frank or postage-stamp, and not upon it as now
practised, in order to efface and to cancel it under the operation of
stamping, which unduly wears out the marking stamp, gives a bad
and unintelligible impression, and is in direct violation of the rules
or statute of the Post-Office Department. This stamp may have
another blotter like (J), which shall be upon the opposite side
thereof, by the use of which the frank or postage-stamp would be
cut, inked, blotted, effaced, and cancelled upon any part of the letter
or envelope where it may be placed. One blotter like (J), however,
is believed to answer the required purpose. This blotter (J) may

be made of any size or shape, and of any material to answer the
end or purpose sought to be obtained. The face, which receives the
ink, and which comes directly upon the frank or postage-stamp, is
grooved or cut, thereby leaving various projections, which have a
sharp or knife edge sufficient for each to cut entirely through the
frank or postage-stamp, but not through the envelope immediately
under the same, while at the same time the places thus cut are
inked by the same sharp-edged projections or cutters on the face of
the said blotter as aforesaid. The said blotter (J) should be made
of the best kind of east-steel, and in such shape as not to break any
part thereof. The projections upon the face of the said blotter
may be kept sharp and in cutting order by filing and sharpening
them when dull."
The claim of this patent is as follows

-

"Having thus set forth and described my invention, what I
claim and desire to secure by letters-patent of the United States
is, -

" The blotter (J), connected or attached to the main part of any
'post-office postmarking stamp' for the purpose of cutting and inking, blotting, and effacing so as to successfully cancel the frank or
postage-stamp of any letter or any package at the same time and
operation of marking or printing upon such letter or package the
name of any post-office, the year, the zmonth, and the day of the
month, substantially as and for the purpose herein set forth."
Another patent was taken out by Norton on the 16bh of De-

cember, 1862, for a double stamp, containing a combination of

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

the postmarker and blotter and the cross-bar connecting them,
and to which they were attached. The drawings attached to
this patent exhibit exactly the same form of instrument which
is exhibited and described in the drawings and specification of
the patent sued on in this case. The blotter, however, instead
of being confined to wood, cork, or other elastic material, was
proposed to be made of "steel, or other material which will
answer the purpose," and to have on its face circular cutters,
enclosed in circular rings, to cut the postage-stamp at the same
time that it defaced it with ink. The invention is described
in the specification as follows: "The nature of my improvement consists in so constructing cancelling stamps that the same shall cut the postage-stamp, or any
stamp similar thereto, without injury to the contents of the envelope or packet enclosed therein, and at the same time cause a heavy
circular mark upon the inside, and one upon the outside of that
part of the stamp or letter-frank cancelled by the cutting device, so
that said postage-stamp or letter-frank shall readily show cancellation in ink, and when removed from the letter or packet on which
the same may have been cancelled it shall be reduced to parts or
pieces whereby a second use of the said stamp or frank is thus prevented although it may have been previously cleaned by a chemical
or other process.
"It also consists in the employment and combination of a cancelling stamp with a cutting and inking device thereon, with a postmarking or rating stamp, so that the cancelling of the letter frank
and the postmarking on the envelope or packet shall be effectually
done by the means fully described hereinafter.
"To enable others skilled in the art to which my invention relates to make and use the same, I will here proceed to describe the
construction and operation thereof, which is as follows, to wit: I
construct the postmarking stamp (D) of steel or any material which
will answer the purpose. (G) is the mortice or opening to receive
the type for the month, the day of the month, and the year, around
which is the name of the place where used. (E) is a screw for the
purpose of holding the type in the said openings (G). This stamp
is secured or firmly fastened to the block or cross-piece (B), Figs.
1, 2, and 3, by means of the screw (K), which is held in its place by
means of the small screw (a), Figs. 1 and 2, which is placed near
one side of the said screw (K) so as to prevent the same from
becoming loose by reason of turning backwards."

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

[Sup. Ct.

After further directions as to the construction of the cancelling stamp, he adds : "The cross-piece (B) is made of iron or steel, and in width the
same as the diameter of the said rating and cancelling stamp, and of
any thickness required. The said cancelling stamp (c) is securely
fastened to the said cross-piece (B), and at any desired distance
from the said rating stamp (D), as seen at Figs. 1, 2, and 3, and in
the same manner as that of the said stamp (D). (H) is a screwbolt or stem, the lower end of which is screwed into the centre of
the said cross-piece (B). The handle (A) is then screwed upon the
said bolt or stem (1-), and firmly upon the said cross-piece (B),
thereby making a stronig and reliable joining of the handle to the
whole stamp."
The claim in this patent is, first, for the cancelling stamp
separately, and, secondly, as follows: "I also claim the combination of the cancelling stamp (c) and the
postmarking or rating stamp (D) with the cross-piece (B), substantially as and for the purposes herein described and set forth."
It is hardly necessary to remark that the patentee could not
include in a subsequent patent any invention embraced or described in a prior one granted to himself, any more than he
could an invention embraced or described in a prior patent
granted to a third person. Indeed, not so well; because he
might get a patent for an invention before patented to a third
person in this country, if he could show that he was the first
and original inventor, and if he should have an interference
declared.
Now, a mere inspection of the patents referred to above will
show that after December, 1862, Norton could not lawfully
claim to have a patent for the general process of stamping letters with a post-mark and cancelling stamp at the same time;
nor for the general combination of a post-stamper and blotter
in one instrument; nor for the combination of a post-stamper
and blotter connected by a cross-bar; for all these things, in one
or other specific form, were exhibited in these prior patents.
Any such claim, therefore, in the reissued patent of 1870
must be inoperative and void, as well because the thing claimed
was anticipated in former patents, as because it would be for a

Oct. 1881.]

JAMES V. CAMPBELL.

different invention from that contained and described in the
original patent. We may, therefore, dismiss from consideration
the third and fourth claims of the reissued patent. If they
are tQ be construed as being broader and claiming more than
the original patent, they are void; if to be construed as claiming nothing more, they are simply redundant, because the first
and second claims embrace all that was in the original, and
more.
The case, then, upon the patent, is narrowed down to the
claim of the specific device of the blotter as described and
claimed in the original patent; and the combination thereof
with the postmarking device in one instrument by means of
the cross-bar. This being the case, it will be pertinent next
to inquire whether the defendant used that device or combination. If he did not, it is unnecessary to pursue the subject
further.
As we have already seen, the cancelling stamp or device,
described in the patent, consisted of a cylinder, corresponding
in length to the postmarking device, and containing a type of
wood, cork, rubber, or other elastic material, slightly projecting
therefrom. It does not appear that this device was ever used
by the defendant. The stamp used by him until January,
1876, had a blotter of cork, it is true; but it was not the specific
device described in the patent, and to which the patent was
restricted. The. cork was not enclosed in a cylinder as demanded by the patent. It was a naked piece of cork directly
attached to the cross-bar by a common wood screw, passing
through a hole in the cross-bar, and driven into the cork,
firmly holding it to the bar. This device, of course, was different from that which was patented. The only other stamp
used by the defendant had a steel blotter, connected with the
postmarker by a solid metallic plate or mass of metal, and
having no cylinder. Neither of these devices infringed the
complainant's patent, construed as we consider it must be in
order to have any validity at all.
The decree of the Circuit Court will be reversed, and the
cause remanded with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint;
and it is
So ordered.

MR. JUSTICE MILLER dissenting.

As regards the right to a patent for an invention like this,
which can be of use to no one but the government of the
United States, and which is, therefore, in effect a contract by
the United States that it will not use that which is essential
to some of its most important operations without paying to the
patentee whatever he may demand for the use of his invention, I have great doubt,- a doubt which it would have been
necessary to solve in this case if the majority of the court had
believed the patent sued on valid.
In the opinion just delivered they have held that while the
original patent to Norton might have been valid for some purposes, the reissued patent is void because it is not for the same
invention. In this view I do not concur.
The general post-office and its branches had long been in
search of an instrument which by one blow- one strike
of the hand- would mark the name of the place where a
letter was mailed and the time, and so deface the postagestamp on the letter as would make it impossible to be used
again.
This had been done by the use of a single die, which held
the type indicating date, &c., and which was made to cover
the stamp also, so that the date obliterated the stamp by covering it. For reasons not necessary to mention this did not
answer, and it became desirable to have an instrument which
at one stroke defaced the stamp and made beside, but apart
from the stamp, the postmark date.
Many attempts to do this had been made with more or less
success. Most of them failed because the handle which conveyed the power from the hand of the operator was so placed
in regard to these two marking instruments that they did not
strike with entire unity, in point of time, on all the space of
the letter to be covered by the two instruments. In my opinion the record shows that Norton was the first man to accomplish this result by uniting these two marking instruments by
a cross-bar between them, and placing the shank or handle
common to them both so precisely in the centre between them
on the cross-bar that the stroke brought the type and the
obliterating device on to the surface of the paper precisely

level, and with.precision as to time, over the space which they
were designed to cover.
This, I think, was the principal merit of his invention.
Connected with it, however, and essential to it, was his device
for obliterating the stamp. In his original patent this is described as a cylinder into which is fastened something which
receives the indelible ink used to obliterate the stamp, and
which imparts it to the surface of the stamp by the blow or
strike already mentioned. This, he said in his original patent,
was made of wood, cork, rubber, or other suitable material.
It was discovered, by experience, afterwards that iron was a
more suitable material than wood, or cork, or rubber, and in
the reissue of the patent, on which this action i3 founded, iron
is mentioned as one of these suitable materials.
I do not think this should invalidate the reissue if the original patent was good. If iron was a suitable material it was
covered by the original patent. If better than the materials
specifically named, that did not exclude it from the original
patent nor make the reissue void.
Nor do I concur in the opinion that the combination of the
printing and erasing instrument by a cross-bar and shank or
handle, which brought the force employed in the stroke to act
equally and simultaneously on all the surface to be impressed,
was anticipated by any other patent or any other invention.
It would serve no good end to go into all the testimony with
the elaborate care which characterizes the opinion of the court
on these disputed points. I therefore content myself with stating the principal points in which I differ with that opinion.
