CHICAGO V.

[Sup. Ct.

TEBBETTS.

1. A., to secure an indebtedness to B., conveyed to C., in trust, certain lands in
the city of Chicago, which were subsequently condemned for a street. B.
permitted the city to take possession of them and make the improvements,
but with the express reservation and condition that he thereby waived no
right against A. or the city. The city paid A. his proportion of the award,
and issued to him a voucher showing the amount awarded, the payment
made, and the balance still due. A. delivered to C. this voucher, and indorsed thereon an order to pay the balance to him, as trustee for B., in full
of principal due for lien on the land. The city paid C. but a part of the
sum due on the voucher, and C., pursuant to a power contained in the deed
of trust, sold the lands at public auction to B., who conveyed them to D.
The voucher was thereupon assigned to )., it being agreed that lie should
have all the rights therein of B. and C. hIeld, that D. is entitled to a
decree against the city for the balance remaining unpaid on the voucher,
with interest thereon from the time it became due.
2. A party guilty of unreasonable and vexatious delay in making payment of
a just claim cannot be relieved by offering to pay interest from the time
when the delay began to be unreasonable and vexatious.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of

the United States for

the Northern District of Illinois.
James D. Bruner, the owner of certain premises in the city
of Chicago, conveyed them by two deeds of trust bearing date
July 10, 1866, and June 12, 1867, respectively, to Levi D.
Boone, as trustee, to secure to the Union Mutual Life Insurance Company the payment of two notes, one for $10,000 and
one for $8,000. On Sept. 9, 1867, Bruner conveyed the premises to Charles A. Gregory, subject to the outstanding indebtedness. Dec. 12, 1867, $2,000 with interest was paid on the
$8,000 note.
The city council having, May 25, 1868, passed an ordinance
for the extension of Dearborn Street, it became necessary
to take the premises for that purpose. Condemnation proceedings were had accordingly, and the damages assessed at
$36,000. The city paid Gregory, March 22, 1869, $20,000,
and on the early part of the following May issued to him a
voucher for $16,000, which he, on the eighteenth day of that
month, assigned to Boone as trustee and general agent of the
company, as collateral security for the payment of the notes.
Certain property-holders who had a large pecuniary interest

in the opening of the street stipulated, in writing, that if Boone
would take no steps to prevent the city from immediately occupying the land and defer enforcing the collection of the notes,
they would pay the company interest semi-annually on the said
sum of $16,000, or on so much thereof as should remain unpaid. It was stipulated that Boone and the company did not
thereby " waive or abandon any right they might have on said
notes against the maker thereof, or any right of suit against
the said city for the recovery of said money, or any right of
entry or possession of said land."
On June 1, 1869, the city, with the consent of the company,
entered upon the land, and has since that date kept and used
it for a public street. On June 5 the city paid Boone $6,000,
which, with the $2,000 before referred to, paid the $8,000 note.
It is admitted by stipulation that the city, after the execution of the agreement, had knowledge thereof, and, but for
such knowledge, would not then have taken possession of the
premises; also, that it had only paid $26,000 on account of
the damages awarded.
Neither the balance due on the voucher nor the $10,000
note having been paid, Boone, as trustee, pursuant to the power
of sale contained in the deed of trust, sold the premises at public auction to the insurance company, and executed to it a

conveyance therefor. The company conveyed, Dec. 27, 1872,
to William C. Tebbetts, a citizen of Massachusetts, the premises, together with any claim which it had either against the
city or Bruner. At the same time Boone, as trustee and
general agent of the company, indorsed and delivered to him
the voucher of the city. Failing to obtain payment thereof,
Tebbetts, in November, 1873, brought ejectment against the
city, but dismissed his action before judgment.
In June, 1877, Tebbetts filed his bill against the city to
compel the payment of the balance due on the voucher.
The court below decreed in his favor for the $10,000 due
on the voucher, together with interest at six per cent per
annum from Jan. 1, 1870.
The city thereupon appealed to this court.
Mr. William C. G-oudy for the appellant.

[Sup. Ct.

MR. JUSTIoE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
The decree in this case must be affirmed. The grounds
taken by the appellant for resisting payment of the $10,000
due on the note given by Bruner to the insurance company,
and secured by the trust deed given to Boone, are quite remarkable. It is conceded that the land embraced in the deed
was regularly condemned for a street in 1868, and assessed at
$36,000, without any deduction for benefits; and that no one
was interested in it except Gregory, the owner of the fee, and
Boone, as trustee for the insurance company, who held two
deeds of trust thereon to secure two several notes for money
loaned, - one for $10,000, before referred to, and one for a
balance of $6,000. On March 22, 1869, the city paid Gregory,
the owner of the equity of redemption, his proportion of the
award, namely, $20,000, and on the 14th of May following the
board of public works of the city gave him a voucher, showing
the amount of the award, the payment made to him, and the
balance still due, namely, $16,000, being the amount due to
the insurance company and secured by the deeds of trust.
This voucher Gregory indorsed with an order to pay the said
balance to Boone as trustee of the insurance company in full
of principal due said company for lien on the land, and delivered the same to him. Boone thereupon made demand on
the city for this balance. On May 21, 1869, the city authorities gave notice that the assessments had been collected, and
that the money was ready in the hands of the city treasurer to
be paid over to the parties entitled; and on the 5th of June
they paid to Boone, the trustee, $6,000, which he applied to
the note on which that amount was due, which was sufficient
to cancel the same. The balance of $10,000, though frequently demanded, was never paid, and this suit was brought
by the appellee as assignee of the company, to recover the
money or the land.
That it was the intent of the parties that Gregory should,
and that they supposed he did, transfer to the company all
claim to the balance of the award made for the land, over and
above the $20,000 received by himself as owner of the equity of
redemption, there cannot be the slightest doubt. The mortgagee was entitled to it, and it was the owner's duty to make

the assignment, if any assignment was necessary; and it was,
in fact, made, or supposed to be made, by the indorsement of
the voucher to the trustee. It was sufficiently made to vest
in the company, or its trustee, the entire equitable interest in
the money and in such security for its payment as yet remained ; and it was manifestly the duty of the city to pay it
accordingly.
But, notwithstanding the notice to that effect, it seems that
the city did not, at the time, have in hand the requisite funds
to pay the last $10,000. The company, however, on receiving
guaranties from other parties, who were interested in the
street, that the interest should be paid at all events (there
being some doubt whether the city would be liable for interest), consented to let the city take possession and go on
with the improvement ; but with the express reservation and
condition that such consent was not to be a waiver or abandonment of any right against the debtor, or any right of suit
against the city for the recovery of the money or the land.
This indulgence on the part of the insurance company has
been the prime cause of all the trouble experienced by it and
its assignee (the present appellee) in collecting the said

money ; that the city has the land, and claims the right to
keep it for the purposes of the street; that the assessed value
was sufficient to pay this claim over and above what was due
to others; and that the company was entitled to the money
in 1869. Payment, however, is resisted, so far as we can
understand the defence, on the ground that the company,
being unable to get its money, treated the land as still subject
to its claim, and directed its trustee to advertise and sell the
same by way of foreclosure, and bid it in at such sale for the
amount of the demand. This, the appellant contends, satisfied
the debt. But the city still claimed the land, and resisted
every attempt of the company to get possession of it. Actions
of ejectment were brought, but were strenuously defended, and
the company was forced to abandon them. The counsel for the
city contended then, as they contend now, that by virtue of
the condemnation proceedings all interests and titles in the land
were condemned, as well that of the trustee under the trust

CHICAGO v. TEBBETTS.

[Sup. Ct.

deeds, as that of the owner of the fee. Hence their argument
on this branch of the case is, that the proceedings for foreclosing the trust deed were illusory and vain. Therefore the
company acquired no title by the foreclosure and sale, and its
assignee, the appellee, has none.
It is thus supposed to be conclusively reasoned out, upon the
soundest principles of logic, first, that the debt is satisfied by
the foreclosure and purchase of the land ; and, secondly, that
all claim to the land was extinguished by the proceedings for
condemnation. If this argument is sound, the appellee certainly has not a particle of ground to stand on. His debt is
gone because he has got the security ; and the security is gone
because it was taken for the street ; and yet the company, or
its assignee, has not received a cent of money, nor any other
consideration whatever.
When, by a train of abstract reasoning, we are brought to
an absurd conclusion, it behooves us carefully to reconsider
the steps by which we have been led up to it. If the last conclusion of the appellant is well founded, namely, that there
was nothing left for the deed of trust to operate upon, and
that the proceedings in foreclosure were indeed illusory and
vain, the first conclusion, that the debt was satisfied by the
form of sale which was gone through in such proceedings, cannot be true.
It is admitted on all hands that the proceedings for condemning the land for a street were duly and properly pursued,
and that the company waived its right to oppose the taking
possession thereof by the city before payment of the assessment.

The courts were probably right in holding, in the

actions of ejectment which have been referred to, that the
city could not be dispossessed. But as the company, when permitting the possession to be taken, reserved all its rights for
the recovery of the money yet due, and as it is conceded that
the city has not paid that money, it is surely against good conscience and every principle of equity to refuse to pay it. We
think, therefore, that the company, or its assignee, standing in
the position of mortgagee of the land, or, which is the same
thing, as cestui que trust under the trust deed, and afterwards
as assignee of the balance due on the award, had a clear

ground of equity for filing the bill in this cause, and is entitled
to a, decree.
The question of interest has been largely discussed by counsel. But in our view of the matter it needs but little consideration. It has been the express statute law of Illinois, at
least ever since 1845, that interest at the rate of six per cent
per annum shall be allowed "on money withheld by an unreasonable and vexatious delay of payment." We have no hesitation in declaring that this is such a case. It is now more
than twelve years since the property was condemned. The
money has been due, and ought to have been paid long ago.
It was the duty of the city to provide for its payment. Instead
of that, it has litigated and contested the demand year after
year, and in court after court.
It is unnecessary to make a minute examination of the
statute law for ascertaining the days and times when, in the
due course of proceeding, the money might have been collected
from the owners of property benefited by the street. It is
manifest that it might have been collected long before the commencement of this suit. But a party guilty of unreasonable
and vexatious delay in making payment of a just claim cannot
be relieved by offering to pay interest from the time when the
delay began to be unreasonable and vexatious. If lie is guilty
of such delay, he is chargeable with interest on the debt from
the time it became due as upon other debts enumerated in the
law. We see nothing to criticise in the amount of interest
allowed by the court below.
Decree affirmed.
