COMPANY V.

[Sup. Ct.

KEMP.

1. A patent, duly signed, countersigned, and sealed, for public lands which, at
the time it was issued, the Land Department had, under the statute, authority to convey cannot be collaterally impeached in an action at law; and the
finding of the department touching the existence of certain facts, or the
performance of certain antecedent acts, upon which the lawful exercise of
that authority may in a particular case depend, cannot in a court of law be
questioned.
2. If in the issuing of a patent the officers of that department take mistaken
views of the law, or draw erroneous conclusions from the evidence, or act
from either imperfect views of duty or corrupt motives, the party aggrieved
cannot set up such matters in a court of law to defeat the patent. Ile must
resort to a court of equity, where le can obtain relief, if his rights are injuriously affected by the existence of the patent, and lie possesses such equities
as will control the legal title vested in the patentee. A stranger to the title
cannot complain of the act of the government in regard thereto.
3, A defendant in ejectment claimed adversely to the title to a placer mining
claim, derived from a patent of the United States bearing date March
29, 1879, which describes, by metes and bounds, the premises, containing
one hundred and sixty-four acres and sixty one-hundredths of an acre, more
or less. Held, that he cannot put in evidence the proceedings in the Land
Department for the purpose of showing that the patent was issued upon a
single application, including several mining locations, some made after the
passage of the act of July 9, 1870, c. 235 (16 Stat. 217), limiting the location
of one person or an association of persons to one hundred and sixty acres,
and others made after the passage of the act of May 10, 1872, c. 152 (17 id.
91), limiting a location to twenty acres for each individual applicant.
4. A patent issued subsequently to the passage of the said act of 1870 may embrace a placer mining claim consisting of more than. one hundred and sixty
acres, and including as many adjoining locations as the patentee had purchased. The proceedings to obtain a patent therefor are the same as when
the claim covers but one location.
5. The terms "location " and "mining claim" defined.
6. Labor and improvements, within the meaning of the statute, are deemed to
have been put on a mining claim, whether it consists of one or more locations, when the labor was performed or the improvements were made for
its development, though in fact such labor and improvements may be on
ground which originally constituted only one of the locations, or may be
at a distance from the claim.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Colorado.
This was an action at law brought in one of the courts of
Colorado by the St. Louis Smelting and Refining Company, a
corporation created under the laws of Missouri, for the possession of a parcel of land in the city of Leadville. On appli-

cation of the defendants it was removed to the Circuit Court
of the United States. The complaint is in the usual form of
actions for the possession of real property under the practice
obtaining in Colorado. It alleges that the plaintiff was duly incorporated, with power to purchase and hold real estate; that it
was the owner in fee and entitled to the possession of the premises mentioned, describing them, and that the defendants wrongfully withheld them, to the damage of the plaintiff of $5,000.
The defendants filed an answer admitting that the plaintiff
was incorporated as averred, but denying that. it was the owner
in fee of the demanded premises, or that they were wrongfully
detained from its possession, or that it had sustained any damnage. The answer also alleged that the plaintiff, as a foreign
corporation, was incompetent to acquire title to any real estate
in Colorado, except such as might be necessary for the transaction of its business as a smelting and refining company, and
that the premises in controversy were not necessary for that
purpose, but were acquired for speculation.
The plaintiff filed a replication, denying its incompetency to
hold real estate as alleged, and averring that it was authorized,
under the laws of Missouri, to buy, sell, and deal in real estate
for any purpose whatever; that the property in controversy
was acquired as a site for smelting and reduction works, and
that such works were afterwards erected upon it and used for
reducing and smelting silver ores.
The case was tried in November, 1879. To maintain the
issues on its part the plaintiff offered in evidence a patent of
the United States to Thomas Starr, dated March 29, 1879, for
mining ground, which, it was admitted, included the premises
in controversy. The patent recited that pursuant to provisions
of chapter six of title thirty-two of the Revised Statutes, there
had been deposited in the General Land-Office the plat and
field-notes of the placer mining claim of Thomas Starr, the
patentee, accompanied by a certificate of the register of the
land-office at Fairplay, Colorado, within which district the premises are situated; that Starr had, on the 6th of March, 1879,
entered an application for the said claim, which contained one
hundred and sixty-four acres of land and sixty-one hundredths
of an acre, more or less. The patent also specified the boun-

SMELTING

Co. v. KEMP.

[Sup. Ct.

daries of the tract according to the field-notes, and contained
the recitals and words of grant and transfer usually inserted in
patents for placer mining land. To the introduction of this
patent the defendants objected ; but the record does not state
on what grounds the objection was founded, and it was overruled. The patent was accordingly admitted in evidence. The
plaintiff traced title to the land by sundry mesne conveyances
from the patentee. It also introduced the certificate of the
register of the same land-office, showing that the application
of Starr at that office to enter and pay for his claim was made
on the 18th of March, 1878 i also a copy of the articles of incorporation of the plaintiff, and of the laws of Missouri under
which the incorporation was bad; and proved that, in 1877,
prior to the existence of the town of Leadville, the company
purchased of the claimant the tract embraced in the patent, for
the purpose of erecting reduction works thereon, and that at
the time of the purchase and when it commenced the construction of the works the land was unoccupied by other parties.
The plaintiff having rested its case, the defendants offered
in evidence a certified copy of the record of proceedings in
the General Land-Office at Washington, upon which Starr
obtained his patent ; to the introduction of which the plaintiff
objected, on the ground that it could only show or tend to show
the regularity or irregularity of the proceedings before the
executive department in obtaining the patent, or the validity
or invalidity of the possessory title or pre-emption right upon
which the patent was founded, and that no evidence could be
introduced to impeach the patent or attack it collaterally, or in
any way affect it in this action. But the court overruled the
objection and admitted the record. To this ruling an exception was taken.
The case being closed, the court instructed the jury substantially as follows: That a patent for a mining claim, since the
passage of the act of Congress of 1870, could not embrace
more than one hundred and sixty acres; that individuals and
associations were, by that act, put upon the same footing, and
that either might take that amount, but that by the mining
act of Congress of 1872 an individual claimant was limited to
twenty acres, whilst an association of persons could still take

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING Co. v. KEMP.

one hundred and sixty, as before; that the proceedings in the
land-office were allowed in evidence, in order to show whether
the patent was issued upon locations made prior to 1870, and
that they showed that the claim of Starr was based upon
twelve or fifteen locations, some of which were prior to 1870,
and some since then; and added, that "if Mr. Starr was the
owner of these claims, if he had obtained them by purchase,
and they were valid and regular locations, he would, under the
act, be required, if lie desired to obtain a patent for them, to
make application for each one of them, to post the notice, as
required by the statute, and give the publication, and file his
plat and survey, and do all these things which are required in
the several claims upon each one of them. If he had done so,
and his right had been supported as to all of them, and the
patent had been issued for all of these claims, and each of
them described in the patent, there would have been no objection to the patent; but it was not competent for him to consolidate these claims and put them all in as one claim, and
upon notice given as one claim, and publication as one claim,
and proceeding throughout as one claim embracing one hundred and sixty-four acres; " and that the officers of the Land
Department had no authority in law to proceed in that way,
and, therefore, the patent upon which the plaintiff relied was
void and its title failed.
To the instructions given exceptions were taken. The jury
thereupon found for the defendants, and judgment in their
favor was accordingly entered. To review this judgment the
plaintiff removed the case here by writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr. TJ.H
cGowan and Mr. Walter
H. Smith for the plaintiff in error, and by Mr. Fletcher P. Cuppy
and Mr. Thomas A. Green for the defendants in error.
Hr. Allen G. Thurman, on behalf of certain interested parties, was beard by the court, in opposition to the judgment
below.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows: As seen by the statement of the case, the plaintiff relies for
a reversal of the judgment upon three grounds: 1st, Error in

SMELTING

Co. v.

KEMP.

[Sup. Ct.

admitting the record of the proceedings of the land-.office to
impeach the validity of the patent to Starr issued upon them;
2d, Error in instructing the jury that a patent for a placer
claim, since the act of 1870, could not embrace in any case
more than one hundred and sixty acres; and, 3d, Error in
instructing the jury that the owner, by purchase of several
claims, must take separate proceedings upon each one, in order
to obtain a valid patent, and that it was not lawful for him to
prosecute a single application upon a consolidation of several
claims into one, or for the land-officers, to allow such application and to issue a patent thereon.
We are of opinion that these several grounds are well taken,
and that in each particular mentioned the court below erred.
The patent of the United States is the conveyance by which
the nation passes its title to portions of the public domain.
For the transfer of that title the law has made numerous provisions, designating the persons who may acquire it and the
terms of its acquisition. That the provisions may be properly
carried out, a land department, as part of the administrative
and executive branch of the government, has been created to
supervise all the various proceedings taken to obtain the title,
from their commencement to their close. In the course of
their duty the officers of that department are constantly called
upon to hear testimony as to matters presented for their consideration, and to pass upon its competency, credibility, and
weight. In that respect they exercise a judicial function, and,
therefore, it has been held in various instances by this court
that their judgment as to matters of fact, properly determinable by them, is conclusive when brought to notice in a collateral proceeding. Their judgment in such cases is, like that
of other special tribunals upon matters within their exclusive
jurisdiction, unassailable except by a direct proceeding for its
correction or annulment. The execution and record of the
patent are the final acts of the officers of the government for
the transfer of its title, and, as they can be lawfully performed
only after certain steps have been taken, that instrument, duly
signed, countersigned, and sealed, not merely operates to pass
the title, but is in the nature of an official declaration by that
branch of the government to which the alienation of the public

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING CO. v. KEMP.

lands, under the law,. is intrusted, that all the requirements
preliminary to its issue have been complied with. The presumptions thus attending it are not open to rebuttal in an
action at law. It is this unassailable character which gives
to it its chief, indeed its only, value, as a means of quieting
its possessor in the enjoyment of the lands it embraces. If
intruders upon them could compel him, in every suit for possession, to establish the validity of the action of the Land
Department and the correctness of its ruling upon matters
submitted to it, the patent, instead of being a means of peace
and security, would subject his rights to constant and ruinous
litigation. He would recover one portion of his land if the
jury were satisfied that the evidence produced justified the
action of that department, and lose another portion, the title
whereto rests upon the same facts, because another jury came
to a different conclusion. So his rights in different suits upon
the same patent would be determined, not by its efficacy as a
conveyance of the government, but according to the fluctuating
prejudices of different jurymen, or their varying capacities
to weigh evidence. Moore v. Wilkinson, 13 Cal. 478; Beard
v. Pedery, 3 Wall. 478, 492.
Of course, when we speak of the conclusive presumptions
attending a patent for lands, we assume that it was issued in a
case where the department had jurisdiction to act and execute
it; that is to say, in a case where the lands belonged to the
United States, and provision had been made by law for their
sale. If they never were public property, or had previously
been disposed of, or if Congress had made no provision for
their sale, or had reserved them, the department would have
no jurisdiction to transfer them, and its attempted conveyance
of them would be inoperative and void, no matter with what
seeming regularity the forms of law may have been observed.
The action of the department would in that event be like that
of any other special tribunal not having jurisdiction of a case
which it had assumed to decide. Matters of this kind, disclosing a want of jurisdiction, may be considered by a court of law.
In such cases the objection to the patent reaches beyond the
action of the special tribunal, and goes to the existence of a
subject upon which it was competent to act.

SMELTING CO. V. KE[prP.

[Sup. Ct,

These views are not new in this court; they have been,
either in express terms or in substance, affirmed in repeated
instances. One of the earliest cases on the subject was that of
Polk's Lessee v. Wendell, reported in 9th Craneh, where the
doctrine we have stated was declared, and the exceptions to it
mentioned. There the plaintiff brought an action upon a
patent of North Carolina, issued in 1800, for five thousand
acres. The defendants relied upon a prior patent of the State
for twenty-five thousand acres, issued in 1795 to one Sevier,
through whom they claimed. Each patent embraced the lands
in controversy, and they were situated in that portion of Tennessee ceded to the United States by North Carolina. On the
trial it was contended that the elder patent was void on its
face because it covered more than five thousand acres, the limit
prescribed for a single entry by the laws of that State. Proof
was also offered that the lands had not been entered in the
office of the entry-taker of the proper county before their cession to the United States, and it was contended that the patent
was therefore invalid. We shall hereafter refer to what the
court said as to the alleged excess of quantity in the patent.
At present we shall only notice the general doctrine declared
as to the unassailability of patents in a court of law, and its
decision upon the admissibility of the proof offered. It seems
that a statute of 1777 directed the appointment in each county
of an officer called an entry-taker, who was required to receive
entries of all vacant lands in his county, and, if the lands thus
entered were not within three months claimed by some other
party than the person entering them, to deliver to such person
a copy of the entry, with its proper number, and an order to
the county surveyor to survey the land. This order was called
a warrant. Upon it and the survey which followed a patent
was issued. If there were no entry, there could be no warrant,
and of course no valid patent. The ninth section declared that
every right claimed by any person to lands which were not
acquired in this mode, or by purchase or inheritance from
parties who did so acquire them, or which were obtained in
fraud or evasion of the provisions of the act, should be declared
void. In 1779 North Carolina ceded to the United States the
territory in which the lands lie for which the patent to Sevier

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING

Co. v. KEMP.

was issued, reserving, however, to the State all existing rights,
which were to be perfected according to its laws. The cession
was accepted by Congress. The survey, upon which the patent
to Sevier was issued, was made in 1795, and the plaintiff, to
impeach the patent, offered, as already stated, to show that
there had been no entry of the land in the office of the entrytaker of the county where it was situated, previous to the cession; that is, in substance, that the grantor had no authority
to make the grant, the land having been previously conveyed
to the United States. This offer was disallowed by the court
below, and as judgment passed for the defendants, the case
was brought to this court, where, as mentioned, the general
doctrine as to the presumptions attending a patent, which we
have stated, was declared, with the exceptions to it. Upon
the general doctrine the court observed, speaking through Mr.
Chief Justice Marshall, that the laws for the sale of the public
lands provided many guards to secure the regularity of grants
and to protect the incipient rights of individuals and of the
State from imposition; that officers were appointed to superintend the business, and rules had been framed prescribing their
duty; that these rules were in general directory, and when all
the proceedings were completed by a patent issued by the
authority of the State, a compliance with those rules was presupposed, and that "every prerequisite has been performed is
an inference properly deducible, and which every man has a
"It
right to draw from the existence of the grant itself."
would, therefore, be extremely unreasonable," said the court,
"to avoid the grant in any court for irregularities in the conduct of those who are appointed by the government to supervise the progressive course of the title from its commencement
to its consummation in apatent;" but there were some things
so essential to the validity of a contract, that the great principles of justice and of law would be violated did there not
exist some tribunal to which an injured party might appeal,
and in which the means by which the elder title was acquired
might be examined, and that a court of equity was a tribunal
better adapted to this object than a court of law; and it added
that " there are cases in which a grant is absolutely void; as
where the State has no title to the thing granted, or where the

SMELTING

Co. v. KEMP.

[Sup. Ct.

officer had no authority to issue the grant. In such cases the
validity of the grant is necessarily examinable at law." So
the court held that proof that no entry had been made in the
office of the entry-taker in the county where the lands patented
were situated, prior to the cession to the United States, was
admissible under the ninth section; for without such entry they
would not be within the reservation mentioned in the act of
cession. In other words, proof was admissible to show that
the State had not retained control over the property, but had
conveyed it to the United States.
In Pattersonv. Wiun, reported in 11th Wheaton, this case
is cited, and, after stating what it decided, the court said: " We
may, therefore, assume as the settled doctrine of this court, that
if a patent is absolutely void upon its face, or the issuing
thereof was without authority, or was prohibited by statute, or
the State had no title, it could be impeached collaterally in a
court of law in an action of ejectment, but in general other objections and defects complained of must be p t in issue in a regular
course of pleading in a direct proceeding to avoid the patent."
The doctrine declared in these cases as to the presumptions
attending a patent has been uniformly followed by this court.
The exceptions mentioned have also been regarded as sound,
although from the general language used some of them may
require explanation to understand fully their import. If the
patent, according to the doctrine, be absolutely void on its
face, it may be collaterally impeached in a court of law. It
is seldom, however, that the recitals of a patent will nullify
its granting clause, as, for instance, that the land which it purports to convey is reserved from sale. Of course, should such
inconsistency appear, the grant would fail. Something more,
however, than an apparent contradiction in its terms is meant
when we speak of a patent being void on its face. It is meant
that the patent is seen to be invalid, either when read in the
light of existing law, or by reason of what the court must take
judicial notice of; as, for instance, that the land is reserved by
statute from sale, or otherwise appropriated, or that the patent
is for an unauthorized amount, or is executed by officers who
are not intrusted by law with the power to issue grants of portions of the public domain.

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING CO. v. KEMP.

So, also, according to' the doctrine in the cases cited, if the
patent be issued without authority, it may be collaterally impeached in a court of law. This exception is subject to the
qualification, that when the authority depends upon the existence of particular facts, or upon the performance of certain
antecedent acts, and it is the duty of the Land Department to
ascertain whether the facts exist, or the acts have been performed, its determination is as conclusive of the existence of
the authority against any collateral attack, as is its determination upon any other matter properly submitted to its decision.
With these explanations of the exceptions, the doctrine of
the cases cited may be taken as expressing the law accepted
by this court since they were decided. Ioofnagle v. Anderson,
7 Wheat. 212; Boardman v. Lessee of Reed, 6 Pet. 328; Bagnell v. Broderiele, 13 id. 436; Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72;
Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530.
In Johnson v. Towsley the court had occasion to consider
under what circumstances the action of the Land Department
in issuing patents was final, and after observing that it had
found no support for the proposition offered in that case by
counsel upon certain provisions of a statute, said, speaking by
Mr. Justice Miller, that the argument for the finality of such
action was " much stronger when founded oin the general doctrine that when the law has confided to a special tribunal the
authority to hear and determine certain matters arising in
the course of its duties, the decision of that tribunal, within the
scope of its authority, is conclusive upon all others." " That
the action of the land-office," the court added, " in issuing a
patent for any of the public land, subject to sale by pre-emption or otherwise, is conclusive of the legal title, must be admitted on the principle above stated, and inall courts and in
all forms of judicial proceedings where this title must control,
either by reason of the limited powers of the court or the
essential character of the proceeding, no inquiry can be permitted under the circumstances under which it was obtained;"
and then observed, that there exists in the courts of equity the
power to correct mistakes and relieve against frauds and impositions ; and that in cases where it was clear that the officers
of the Land Department had by a mistake of the law given to

SMELTING CO. V. KEMP.

[Sup. Ct,

one man the land which, on the undisputed facts, belonged to
another, to give proper relief. The doctrine thus stated was
approved in the subsequent case of Moore v. Robbins.
The general doctrine declared may be stated in a different
form, thus: A patent, in a court of law, is conclusive as to all
matters properly determinable by the Land Department, when
its action is within the scope of its authority, that is, when it
has jurisdiction under the law to convey the land. In that
court the patent is unassailable for mere errors of judgment.
Indeed, the doctrine as to the regularity and validity of its acts,
where it has jurisdiction, goes so far that if in any circumstances
under existing law a patent would be held valid, it will be presumed that such circumstances existed. Thus, in Minter v.
Crommelin, reported in 18th Howard, where it appeared that
an act of Congress of 1815 had provided that no land reserved
to a Creek warrior should be offered for sale by an officer of
the Land Department unless specifically directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and declared that if the Indian abandoned the reserved land it should become forfeited to the United
States, a patent was issued for the land, which did not show
that the Secretary had ordered it to be sold, and the court said :
"The rule being that the patent is evidence that all previous
steps had been regularly taken to justify making of the patent;
and one of the necessary steps here being an order from the Seeretary to the register to offer the land for sale because the warrior had abandoned it, we are bound to presume that the
order was given. That such is the effect, as evidence, of the
patent produced by the plaintiffs was adjudged in the case of
Bagnell v. Broderick (13 Pet. 436), and is not open to controversy anywhere, and the State court was mistaken in holding
otherwise."
On the other hand, a patent may be collaterally impeached
in any action, and its operation as a conveyance defeated, by
showing that the department had no jurisdiction to dispose of
the lands; that is, that the law did not provide for selling them,
or that they had been reserved from sale or dedicated to special
purposes, or had been previously transferred to others. In
establishing any of these particulars the judgment of the department upon matters properly before it is not assailed, nor is

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING

Co. v.

KEMP.

the regularity of its proceedings called into question; but its
authority to act at all is denied, and shown never to have
existed.
According to the doctrine thus expressed and the cases cited in
its support, -and there are none in conflict with it,-there can
be no doubt that the court below erred in admitting the record
of the proceedings upon which the patent was issued, in order
to impeach its. validity. The judgment of the department upon
their sufficiency was not, as already stated, open to contestation. If in issuing a patent its officers took mistaken views of
the law, or drew erroneous conclusions from the evidence, or
acted from imperfect views of their duty, or even from corrupt
motives, a court of law can afford no remedy to a party alleging
that he is thereby aggrieved. He must resort to a court of
equity for relief, and even there his complaint cannot be heard
unless lie connect himself with the original source of title, so
as to be able to aver that his rights are injuriously affected by
the existence of the patent; and he must possess such equities
as will control the legal title in the patentee's hands. Boggs v.
Meced Jining Co., 14 Cal. 279, 363. It does not lie in the
mouth of a stranger to the title to complain of the act of the
government with respect to it. If the government is dissatisfied,
it can, on its own account, authorize proceedings to vacate the
patent or limit its operation.
This doctrine as to the conclusiveness of a patent is not inconsistent with the right of the patentee, often recognized by
this court, to show the date of the original proceeding for the
acquisition of the title, where it is not stated in the instrument,
as the patent is deemed to take effect by relation as of that
date, so far as it is necessary to cut off intervening adverse
claims. Thus, in a contest between two patentees for the same
land, it may be shown that a junior patent was founded upon
an earlier entry than an older patent, and therefore passes the
title. Such evidence in no way trenches upon the ruling of
the department upon matters pending before it. Nor is the
doctrine of the conclusiveness of the patent inconsistent with
the right of a party resisting it to show, if an entry is not
stated in the instrument, that no entry of the land was made
as an initiatory proceeding, where a statute, as was the case in

SMELTING Co. v. KEMP.

[Sup. Ct.

North Carolina, mentioned in Polk's Lessee v. Wendell, declares
that proceedings for the title, when such entry has not been
made, shall be adjudged invalid. A statute may in any case
require proof of a fact which otherwise would be presumed.
Except with reference to such anterior matters and others of
like character, no one in a court of law can go behind the
patent and call in question the validity of the proceedings upon
which it is founded.
The case at bar, then, is reduced to the question whether the
patent. to Starr is void on its face; that is, whether, read in the
light of existing law, it is seen to be invalid. It does not come
within any of the exceptions mentioned in the cases cited. The
lands it purports to convey are mineral, and were a part of the
public domain. The law of Congress had provided for their
sale. The proper officers of the Land Department supervised
the proceedings. It bears the signature of the President, or
rather of the officer authorized by law to place the President's signature to it, which is the same thing; it is properly
countersigned, and the seal of the General Land-Office is attached to it. It is regular on its face, unless some limitation
in the law, as to the extent of a mining claim which can be patented, has been disregarded. The case of the defendants rests
on the correctness of their assertion that a patent cannot issue
for a mining claim which embraces over one hundred and sixty
a(res. Assuming that the words " more or less," accompanying
the statement of the acres contained in the claim, are to be
disregarded, and that the patent is construed as for one hundred and sixty-four acres and a fraction of an acre, there is
nothing in the acts of Congress which prohibits the issue of a
patent for that amount. They are silent as to the extent of
a mining claim. They speak of locations and limit the extent
of mining ground which an individual or an association of individuals may embrace in one of them. There is nothing in the
reason of the thing, or in the language of the acts, which prevents an individual from acquiring by purchase the ground
located by others and adding it to his own. The difficulty
with the court below, as seen in its charge, evidently arose
from confounding " location " and " mining claim," as though
the two terms always represent the same thing, whereas they

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING Co. v. KEMP.

often mean very different things. A mining claim is a parcel
of land containing precious metal in its soil or rock. A location is the act of appropriating such parcel, according to certain
established rules. It usually consists in placing on the ground,
in a conspicuous position, a notice setting forth the name of the
locator, the fact that it is thus taken or located, with the requisite description of the extent and boundaries of the parcel,
according to the local customs, or, since the statute of 1872,
according to the provisions of that act. Rev. Stat., sect. 2324.
The location, which is the act of taking the parcel of mineral
land, in time became among the miners synonymous with the
mining claim originally appropriated. So, now, if the miner
has only the ground covered by one location, "his mining
claim " and " location " are identical, and the two designations
may be indiscriminately used to denote the same thing. But
if by purchase he acquires the adjoining location of his neighbor,-that is, the ground which his neighbor has taken up,and adds it to his own, then his mining claim covers the ground
embraced by both locations, and henceforth he will speak of it
as his claim. Indeed, his claim may include as many adjoining locations as he can purchase, and the ground covered by all
will constitute what lie claims for mining purposes, or, in other
words, will constitute his mining claim, and be so designated.
Such is the general understanding of miners and the meaning
they attach to the term.
Previously to the act Of July 9, 1870, Congress imposed no
limitation to the area which might be included in the location
of a placer claim. This, as well as every other thing relating
to the acquisition and continued possession of a mining claim,
was determined by rules and regulations established by miners
themselves. Soon after the discovery of gold in California, as
is well known, there was an immense immigration of goldseekers into that Territory. They spread over the mineral regions and probed the earth in all directions in pursuit of the
precious metals. Wherever they went they framed rules prescribing the conditions upon which mining ground might be
taken up, in other words, mining claims be located and their
continued possession secured. Those rules were so framed as
to give to all immigrants absolute equality of right and privi-

lege. The extent of ground which each might locate, that is,
appropriate to himself, was limited so that all might, in the
homely and expressive language of the day, have an equal
chance in the struggle for the wealth there buried in the earth.
But a few months' experience in the precarious and toilsome
pursuit drove great numbers of the miners to seek other means
of livelihood and fortune, and they therefore disposed of their
claims. They never doubted that their rights could be transferred so that the purchaser would hold the claims by an
equally good title. Their transferable character was always
recognized by the local courts, and the title of the grantee
enforced. Many individuals thus, became the possessors of
claims covering ground taken up by different locations, and
the amount which each person or an association of persons
might acquire and hold was only limited by his or their means
of purchase.
The rules and regulations originally established in California have in their general features been adopted throughout all
the mining regions of the United States. They were so wisely
framed and were so just and fair in their operation that they
have not to any great extent been interfered with by legislation, either state or national. In the first mining statute,
passed July 9, 1866, they received the recognition and sanction of Congress, as they had previously the legislative and
judicial approval of the States and Territories in which mines
of gold and silver were found. That act declared, and the
declaration was repeated in a subsequent statute, that the mineral lands of the public domain were free and open to occupation and exploration by all citizens of the United States, and
by those who had declared their intention to become such,
subject to such regulations as might be prescribed by law, and
subject, also, "to the local customs or rules of miners of the
several mining districts," so far as the same were not in conflict with the laws of the United States. It authorized the
issue of patents for claims on veins or lodes of quartz or other
"rock in place" bearing gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper.
Placer claims first became the subject of .regulation by the
mining act of July 9, 1870, c. 235 (16 Stat. 217), which provided that patents for them might be issued under like cir-

cumstances and conditions as for vein or lode claims, and that
persons having contiguous claims of any size might make joint
entry thereof. But it also provided that no location of a
placer claim thereafter made should exceed one hundred and
sixty acres for one person or an association of persons. The
mining act of May 10, 1872, c. 152 (17 id. 91), declared that
a location of a placer claim subsequently made should not
include more than twenty acres for each individual claimant.
These are all the provisions touching the extent of locations
of placer claims, and they are re-enacted in the Revised Statutes. Sects. 2330, 2331. A limitation is not put upon the
sale of the ground located, nor upon the number of locations
which may be acquired by purchase, nor upon the number
which may be included in a patent. Every interest in lands
is the subject of sale and transfer, unless prohibited by statute,
and no words allowing it are necessary. In the mining statutes numerous provisions assume and recognize the salable
character of one's interest in a mining claim. Sect. 13 of
the act of 1870 declares that where a person or association or
their grantors have held and worked claims for a period equal
to the time prescribed by the Statute of Limitations of the
State or Territory where the same is situated, evidence of such
possession and working shall be sufficient to establish the right
to a patent. Sect. 5 of the act of 1872, rendering a mining
claim subject to relocation where certain conditions of improvement or expenditure have not been made, has a proviso that
the original locators, "their heirs, assigns, or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after such failure
and before such location." These provisions are of themselves
conclusive that the locator's interest in a mining grant is salable and transferable, even were there any doubt on the subject,
in the absence of express statutory prohibition. Those of the
act of 1870 are also conclusive of the right of the purchaser of
claims to a patent, for it is with reference to it that the derivative right by purchase or assignment is mentioned. Rev. Stat.,
sects. 2332, 2334.
In addition to all this, it is difficult to perceive what object
would be gained, what policy subserved, by a prohibition to
embrace in one patent contiguous mining ground taken up by

SMELTING

[Sup. Ct.

different locations and subsequently purchased and held by
one individual. He can hold as many locations as he can purchase, and rely upon his possessory title. He is protected
thereunder as completely as if he held a patent for them subject to the condition of certain annual expenditures upon them
in labor or improvements. If he wishes, however, to obtain a
patent, he must, in addition to other things, pay the government a fee of five dollars an acre, a sum that would not be
increased if a separate patent were issued for each location.
The decision of this court upon one point in the case of
Polk's Lessees v. Wendell, already cited, is directly applicable
here. The patent to the defendants in that case was for
twenty-five thousand acres of laud, and one of the objections
taken was that it was void because the statate of North Carolina limited an entry of one person to five thousand acres.
But the statute declared that where two or more persons had
entered, or should afterwards enter, lands jointly, or where two
or more persons agreed to have their entries surveyed jointly
in one or more surveys, the surveyor should survey the same
accordingly in one entire survey. It was contended that as
the statute provided for entries made by two or more persons
it could not be extended to the case of distinct entries belonging to the same person. To this the court replied as follows:
" For this distinction it is impossible to conceive a reason.
No motlive can be imagined for allowing two or more persons
to unite their entries in one survey which does not apply with
at least as much force for allowing a single person to unite his
entries, adjoining each other, in one survey. It appears to the
court that the case comes completely within the spirit, and is
not opposed by the letter, of the law. The case provided for
is ' where two or more persons agree to have their entries surveyed jointly,' &c. Now this does not prevent the subsequent
assignment of the entries to one of the parties ; and the assignment is itself the agreement of the assignor that the assignee
may survey the entries jointly or severally, at his election.
The court is of opinion that, under a sound construction of this
law, entries, which might be joined in one survey, if remaining
the property of two or more persons, may be joined, though
they become the property of a single person." . The objection

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING

Co. v.

KEMP.

to the patent by reason of its embracing over five thousand
acres was accordingly overruled.
By a provision of the mining act of 1870, still in force, two
or more persons, or association of persons, having contiguous
claims of any size, are allowed to make a joint entry thereof.
Rev. Stat., sect. 2330. If one individual should acquire all
such contiguous claims by purchase, no sound reason can be
suggested why he should not be equally entitled to enter them
all by one entry as when they were held by the original parties. To quote the language of the case cited, "No motive can
be imagined for allowing two or more persons to unite their
entries in one survey which does not apply with *at least as
much force for allowing a single person to unite his entries
adjoining each other in one survey."
The last position of the court below, that the owner of contiguous locations who seeks a patent must present a separate
application for each, and obtain a separate survey, and prove
that upon each the required work has been performed, is as
untenable as the rulings already considered.

The object in

allowing patents is to vest the fee in the miner, and thus
encourage the construction of permanent works for the development of the mineral resources of the country. Requiring
a separate application for each location, with a separate survey and notice, where several adjoining each other are held by
the same individual, would confer no benefit beyond that accruing to the land-officers from an increase of their fees. The
public would derive no advantage from it, and the owner would
be subjected to onerous and often ruinous burdens. The services of an attorney are usually retained when a patent is
sought, and the expenses attendant upon the proceeding are
in many instances very great. To lessen these as much as possible the practice has been common for miners to consolidate,
by conveyance to a single person or an association or company,
many contiguous claims into one, for which only one application is made and of which only one survey is had. Long
before patents were allowed - indeed, from the earliest period
in which mining for gold and silver was pursued as a business-miners were in the habit of consolidating adjoining
claims, whether they consisted of one or more original loca-

SMELTING

[Sup. Ct,

tions, into one, for convenience and economy in working them.
It was, therefore, very natural, when patents were allowed,
that the practice of presenting a single application with one
survey of the whole tract should prevail. It was at the outset,
and has ever since been, approved by the department, and its
proprieiy has never before been questioned. Patents, we are
informed, for mining ground of the value of many millions of
dollars, have been issued upon consolidated claims, nearly all
of which would be invalidated if the positions assumed by the
defendants could be sustained.
It was urged on the argument that a patent for each location
was required to prevent a monopoly of mining ground, - to
prevent, to use the language of counsel, the public domain from
being "monopolized by speculators." The law limiting the
extent of mining lands which an individual may locate has
provided, so far as it was deemed wise, against an accumulation
of them in one person's hands. It could not have prohibited
the sale of the location of an individual without imposing a
restriction injurious to his interests, and in many instances
destructive of the whole value of his claim. Every one, at all
familiar with our mineral regions, knows that the great majority of claims, whether on lodes or on placers, can be worked
advantageously only by a combination among the miners, or by
a consolidation of their claims through incorporated companies.
Water is essential for the working of mines, and in many instances can be'obtained only from great distances, by means of
canals, flumes, and aqueducts, requiring for their construction
enormous expenditures of money, entirely beyond the means of
a single individual. Often, too, for the development of claims,
streams must be turned from their beds, dams built, shafts
sunk at great depth, and flumes constructed to carry away the
d6bris of the mine. Indeed, successful mining, whether on
lode claims or placer claims, can seldom be prosecuted without an amount of capital beyond the means of the individual
miner.
There is no force in the suggestion that a separate patent
for each location is necessary to insure the required expenditure of labor upon it. The statute of 1872 provides that on
each claim subsequently located, until a patent is issued for it,

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING

Co. v.

there shall be annually expended in labor or improvements one
hundred dollars; and on claims previously located an annual
expenditure of ten dollars for each one hundred feet in length
along the vein; but where such claims are held "in common,"
the expenditure may be upon any one claim. As these provisions relate to expenditures before a patent is issued, proof of
them will be a matter for consideration when application for
the patent is made. It is not perceived in what way this proof
can be changed or the requirement affected, whether the application be for a patent for one claim or for several claims held
in common. Labor and improvements, within the meaning of
the statute, are deemed to have been had on a mining claim,
whether it consists of one location or several, when the labor
is performed or the improvements are made for its development, that is, to facilitate the extraction of the metals it may
contain, though in fact such labor and improvements may be
on ground which originally constituted only one of the locations, as in sinking a shaft, or be at a distance from the claim
itself, as where the labor is performed for the turning of a
stream, or the introduction of water, or where the improvement consists in the construction of a flume to carry off the
d6bris or waste materil. It would be absurd to require a
shaft to be sunk on each location in a consolidated claim, when
one shaft would suffice for all the locations; and yet that is
seriously argued by counsel, and must be maintained to uphold
the judgment below.
The statutes provide numerous guards against the evasion of
their provisions by parties seeking a mining patent, and afford
an opportunity to persons in the neighborhood of the claim to
come forward and present any objections they may have to the
granting of the patent desired. By sects. 6 and 7 of the act
of 1872, which constitute sects. 2325 and 2326 of the Revised
Statutes, the procedure which a party seeking a patent, whether
an individual or an association or a corporation, must follow
is prescribed: 1st, The party must file an application in the proper landoffice under oath, showing a compliance with the law, together
with a plat and the field-notes of the claim, or " claims in common," made by or under the direction of the Surveyor-General

SMELTING

Co. v. KEMP.

[Sup. Ct.

of the United States, showing the boundaries of the claim or
claims, which must be distinctly marked by monuments on the
ground.
2d, Previously, however, to the filing of the application, the
claimant must post a copy of the plat, with a notice of his
intended application, in a conspicuous place on the land embraced in it, and file an affidavit of at least two persons that
such notice has been duly posted with a copy of the notice in
the land-office.
3d, When such application, plat, field-notes, notice, and affidavits have been filed, the register of the land-office is required
to publish a notice of the application for the period of sixty
days, in a newspaper, to be designated by him, nearest to the
claim, and post such notice in his office for the same period.
4th, The claimant, at the time of filing his application, or
at any time thereafter within sixty days, is required to file
with the register a certificate of the United States SurveyorGeneral, that five hundred dollars' worth of labor has been
expended, or improvements to that amount have been made
upon the claim by himself or grantors; that the plat is correct,
with such further description, by reference to natural objects
or permanent monuments, as shall identify the claim, and furnish an accurate description to be incorporated in the patent.
5th, At the expiration of sixty days the claimant is required
to file his affidavit showing that the plat and notice have been
posted in a conkpicuous place on the claim during the period of
publication. If no adverse claim shall have been filed with
the register and receiver of the proper land-office within the
sixty days of publication, it is then to be assumed that the applicant is entitled to a patent upon the payment to the proper
officer of five dollars per acre, and that no adverse claim exists.
6th, The statute then proceeds to declare that if an adverse
claim is filed during the period of publication, it must be upon
the oath of the party making it, and must show the nature,
boundaries, and extent of such adverse claim; and all proceedings, except the publication of the notice and the making and
filing of the affidavit, shall be thereupon stayed until the controversy shall have been settled by a decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction, or the adverse claim waived. And it

Oct. 1881.]

SMELTING

Co. v.

is made the duty of the adverse claimant, within thirty days
after filing his claim, to commence proceedings in a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine the question of the right
of possession, and to prosecute the same with reasonable diligence to final judgment; and a failure to do so is to be deemed
a waiver of his adverse claim. After judgment has been rendered in such proceedings, the party entitled to the possession
of the claim, or any portion of it, may file a certified copy of
the judgment-roll with the register of the land-office, together
with a certificate of the Surveyor-General that the requisite
amount of labor has been expended or improvements made
thereon, and the description required in other cases; and must
pay to the receiver five dollars an acre for his claim, together
with the proper fees; and then the whole proceedings and the
judgment-roll are to be certified by the register to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, and a patent thereupon
issued for the claim, or such portion thereof as the applicant,
by the decision of the court, shall appear to be entitled to.
It will thus be seen that if an adverse claim is made to the
mining ground for which a patent is sought, its validity must
be determined by a local court, unless it be waived, before a
patent can be issued. There would seem, therefore, to be
more cogent reasons, in cases where a patent for such ground
is relied upon, to maintain the doctrine which we have declared,
that it cannot be assailed in a collateral proceeding, than in
the case of a patent for agricultural land.
But it is unnecessary to pursue the subject further. The
judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause
remanded for a new trial; and it is
