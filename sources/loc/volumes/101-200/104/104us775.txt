WARNOCK v. DAVIS.

WARNOCK v. DAVIS.
1. A person who has procured a policy of insurance on his life cannot assign
it to parties who have no insurable interest in his life. Cammacc v. Lewis
(15 Wall. 643) cited and approved.
2. The plaintiff's intestate, on procuring an insurance upon his life, entered into
an agreement with a firm, whereby the latter was to pay all fees and assessments payable to tie underwriters on the policy and to receive nine
tenths of the amount due thereon at his death. Pursuant to the agreement,
he executed an assignment of the policy (infra, p. 777), and the firm paid
the fees and assessments. On his death, the firm collected from the underwriters nine tenths of the amount due on the policy and his administrator
sued the firm therefor. The parties to the agreement did not thereby design to perpetrate a fraud upon any one. Held, that the plaintiff was entitied to recover from the firm the moneys so collected with interest thereon,
less the sums advanced by the firm.

Southern District of Ohio.
Warnock, the plaintiff, is the administrator of the estate of
Henry L. Crosser, deceased, and a resident of Kentucky. Davis
and the other defendants are partners, under the name of the
Scioto Trust Association, of Portsmouth, Ohio, and reside in
that State. On the 27th of February, 1872, Crosser applied to
the Protection Life Insurance Company, of Chicago, a corporation created under the laws of Illinois, for a policy on his
life to the amount of $5,000; and, on the same day, entered
into the following agreement with the Scioto Trust Association

-

The policy, bearing even date with the agreement, was issued
to Crosser, and on the following day he executed to the association the following assignment: -

"In consideration of the terms and stipulations of a certain agreement concluded by and between the undersigned and the Scioto
Trust Association, of Portsmouth, Ohio, and for value received, I
hereby waive and release, transfer and assign, to said Scioto Trust
Association all my right, title, and interest in and to the within life

Insurance Company, of Chicago, Illinois, and all sum or sums of
money due, owing, and recoverable by virtue of said policy, save

deducting therefrom the amount, if any, which I may owe to said
Scioto Trust Association for fees or dues, shall be paid to Kate
Crosser, or, in case of her death, to such person or persons as the
law may direct. And I hereby constitute, without power of revocation on my part, the said Scioto Trust Association my attorney, with

Crosser died on the 11th of September, 1873, and. on the 16th
of May, 1874, the association collected from the company the
amount of the policy, namely, $5,000; one-tenth of which,
$500, less certain sums due under the agreement, was paid to
the widow of the deceased.

The present action is brought to recover the balance, which
with interest exceeds $5,000. The defendants admit the collection of the money from the insurance company ; but, to defeat the action, rely upon the agreement mentioned, and the

assignment are specifically mentioned in the second and third
of the three defences set up in their answer. The first defence
consists in a general allegation that Crosser assigned, in good
faith and for a valuable consideration, nine tenths of the policy
to the defendants ; that a power of attorney was at the time
executed to them to collect the remaining one tenth and pay
the same over to his widow; and that after the collection of
the amount they had paid the one tenth to her and taken her
receipt for it.
The case was tried by the court without the intervention of
a jury. On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence the deposition of the receiver of the insurance company, who produced
from the papers in his custody the policy of insurance, the
agreement and assignment mentioned, the proofs presented to
the company of the death of the insured, and the receipt by
the association of the insurance money. There was no other
testimony offered. The court thereupon found for the defendants, to which finding the plaintiff excepted. Judgment being
entered thereon in their favor, the case is brought to this court
for review.
Mr. J. B. Forakcer for the plaintiff in error.
M1r. A. C. Thompson for the defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the facts, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows: As seen from the statement of the case, the evidence before
the court was not conflicting, and it was only necessary to meet
the general allegations of the first defence. All the facts established by it are admitted in the other defences. The court
could not have ruled in favor of the defendants without holding that the agreement between the deceased and the Scioto
Trust Association was valid, and that the assignment transferred to it the right to nine-tenths of the money collected on
the policy. For alleged error in these particulars the plaintiff
asks a reversal of the judgment.

The policy executed on the life of the deceased was a valid
contract, and as such was assignable by the assured to the association as security for any sums lent to him, or advanced for the
premiums and assessments upon it. But it was not assignable

Oct. 1881.]

WARNOCK V. DAVIS.

to the association for any other purpose. The association had
no insurable interest in the life of the deceased, and could not
have taken out a policy in its own name. Such a policy would
constitute what is termed a wager policy, or a mere speculative
contract upon the life of the assured, with a direct interest in
its early termination.
It is not easy to define with precision what will in all cases
constitute an insurable interest, so as to take the contract out
of the class of wager policies. It may be stated generally,
however, to be such an interest, arising from the relations of
the party obtaining the insurance, either as creditor of or
surety for the assured, or from the ties of blood or marriage
to him, as will justify a reasonable expectation of advantage
or benefit from the continuance of his life. It is not necessary that the expectation of advantage or benefit should be
always capable of pecuniary estimation; for a parent has an
insurable interest in the life of his child, and a child in the
life of his parent, a husband in the life of his wife, and a wife
in the life of her husband. The natural affection in cases of
this kind is considered as more powerful -as
operating more
efficaciously - to protect the life of the insured than any other
consideration.
But in all cases there must be a reasonable
ground, founded upon the relations of the parties to each other,
either pecuniary or of blood or affinity, to expect some benefit
or advantage from the continuance of the life of the assured.
Otherwise the contract is a mere wager, by which the party
taking the policy is directly interested in the early death of
the assured. Such policies have a tendency to create a desire
for the event. They are, therefore, independently of any statute on the subject, condemned, as being against public policy.
The assignment of a policy to a party not having an insurable interest is as objectionable as the taking out of a policy
in his name. Nor is its character changed because it is for
a portion merely of the insurance money. To the extent in
which the assignee stipulates for the proceeds of the policy
beyond the sums advanced by him, he stands in the position of
one holding a wager policy. The law might be readily evaded,
if the policy, or an interest in it, could, in consideration of
paying the premiums and assessments upon it, and the promise

780

WARNOCK V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

to pay upon the death of the assured a portion of its proceeds
to his representatives, be transferred so as to entitle the
assignee to retain the whole insurance money.
The question here presented has arisen, under somewhat different circumstances, in several of the State courts ; and there
is a conflict in their decisions. In Franclin Life Insurance
Company v. tIazzard, which arose in Indiana, the policy of insurance, which was for $3,000, contained the usual provision
that if the premiums were not paid at the times specified the
policy would be forfeited. The second premium was not paid,
and the assured, declaring that he had concluded not to keep up
the policy, sold it for twenty dollars to one having no insurable
interest, who took an assignment of it with the consent of the
secretary of the insurance company. The assignee subsequently settled with the company for the unpaid premium.
In a suit upon the policy, the Supreme Court of the State
held that the assignment was void, stating that all the objections against the issuing of a policy to one upon the life of another, in whose life he has no insurable interest, exist against
holding such a policy by mere purchase and assignment. "In
either case," said the court, "the holder of such policy is interested in the death rather than the life of the party assured.
The law ought to be, and we think it clearly is, opposed to
such speculations in human life." (41 Ind. 116.) The court
referred with approval to a decision of the same purport by
the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Stevens v. Warren,
101 Mass. 564. There the question presented was whether
the assignment of a policy by the assured in his lifetime,
without the assent of the insurance company, conveyed any
right in law or equity to the proceeds when due. The court
was unanimously of opinion that it did not; holding that it
was contrary not only to the terms of the contract, but contrary to the general policy of the law respecting insurance, in
that it might lead to gambling or speculative contracts upon
the chances of human life. The court also referred to provisions sometimes inserted in a policy expressing that it is for the
benefit of another, or is payable to another than the representatives of the assured, and, after remarking that the contract
in such a case might be sustained, said " that the same would

Oct. 1881.]

WARNOCK V. DAVIS.

probably be held in the case of an assignment with the assent
of the assurers. But if the assignee has no interest in the life
of the subject which would sustain a policy to himself, the
assignment would take effect only as a designation, by mutual
agreement of the parties, of the person who should be entitled
to receive the proceeds when due, instead of the personal representatives of the deceased. And if it should appear that the
arrangement was a cover for a speculating risk, contravening
the general policy of the law, it would not be sustained."
Although the agreement between the Trust Association and
the assured was invalid as far as it provided for an absolute
transfer of nine tenths of the proceeds of the policy upon the
conditions named, it was not of that fraudulent kind with
respect to which the courts regard the parties as alike culpable and refuse to interfere with the results of their action.
No fraud or deception upon any one was designed by the
agreement, nor did its execution involve any moral turpitude. It is one which must be treated as creating no legal
right to the proceeds of the policy beyond the sums advanced
upon its security ; and the courts will, therefore, hold the recipient of the moneys beyond those sums to account to the
representatives of the deceased. It was lawful for the association to advance to the assured the sums payable to the
insurance company on the policy as they became due. It
was, also, lawful for the assured to assign the policy as security for their payment. The assignment was only invalid as
a transfer of the proceeds of the policy beyond what was required to refund those sums, with interest. To hold it valid
for the whole proceeds would be to sanction speculative risks
on human life, and encourage the evils for which wager policies
are condemned.
The decisions of the New York Court of Appeals are, we
are aware, opposed to this view. They hold that a valid
policy of insurance effected by a person upon his own life,
is assignable like an ordinary chose in action, and that the
assignee is entitled, upon the death of the assured, to the full
sum payable without regard to the consideration given by
him for the assignment, or to his possession of any insurable interest in the life of the assured. St. John v. Amnerican

WARNOCK V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

Mutual Life Insurance Company, 13 N. Y. 31; Valton v. National Loan Fund Life Assurance Company, 20 id, 32. In the
opinion in the first case the court cite Ashley v. Ashley (3
Simons, 149) in support of its conclusions; and it must be
admitted that they are sustained by many other adjudications.
But if there be any sound reason for holding a policy invalid
when taken out by a party who has no interest in the life of
the assured, it is difficult to see why that reason is not as
cogent and operative against a party taking an assignment
of a policy upon the life of a person in which he has no
interest. The same ground which invalidates the one should
invalidate the other- so far, at least, as to restrict the right
of the assignee to the sums actually advanced by him. In the
conflict of decisions on this subject we are free to follow those
which seem more fully in accord with the general policy of the
law against speculative contracts upon human life.
In this conclusion we are supported by the decision in CamThere a policy of life insurmack v. Lewis, 15 Wall. 643.
ance for $3,000, procured by a debtor at the suggestion of a
creditor to whom he owed $70, was assigned to the latter to
secure the debt, upon his promise to pay the premiums, and, in
case of the death of the assured, one third of the proceeds to
his widow. On the death of the assured, the assignee collected
the money from the insurance company and paid to the widow
$950 as her proportion after deducting certain payments made.
The widow, as administratrix of the deceased's estate, subsequently sued for the balance of the money collected, and recovered judgment. The case being brought to this court, it
was held that the transaction, so far as the creditor was concerned, for the excess beyond the debt owing to him, was a
wagering policy, and that the creditor, in equity and good conscience, should hold it only as security for what the debtor
owed him when it was assigned, and for such advances as he
might have afterwards made on account of it; and that the
assignment was valid only to that extent. This decision is in
harmony with the views expressed in this opinion.
The judgment of the court below will, therefore, be reversed,
and the cause remanded with direction to enter a judgment for
the plaintiff for the amount collected from the insurance corn-

So ordered.

Fox v.

CINCINNATI.

1. Pursuant to authority conferred by law, the board of public works of a
State leased the surplus water of her canals, but-reserved the right to
resume the use of it, when it should be needed for the purposes of navigation. A statute was subsequently passed whereby one of the canals within
certain limits was granted to, and appropriated by, a city for a highway.
Held, that the lessee was not thereby deprived of his property without due
process of law, as the State, so far from assuming an obligation to maintain
the canals to supply water-power, had the right, of which every lessee was
bound to take notice, to discontinue them, whenever the legislature deemed
expedient.
2. The question as to whether the city acted in 'excess of the grant, and violated
the conditions thereto annexed, cannot be re-examined here on a writ of
error to a State court.

Mn. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
By the laws of Ohio the board of public works was authorized to sell or lease, for hydraulic purposes, the surplus xater in
the canals of the State not required for the purposes of navigation. This included water passing round the locks from one
level to another; but it was expressly provided that no power
should be leased or sold, except such as should accrue from
surplus water, "after supplying the full quantity necessary for
the purposes of navigation." The laws also required that every
lease or grant of power should contain a reservation of the right
to resume the privilege, in whole or in part, whenever it might
be deemed necessary for the purposes of navigation. In case
of resumption, the rents reserved were to be remitted or corre-
