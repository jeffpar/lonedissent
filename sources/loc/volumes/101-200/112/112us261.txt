Statement of Facts.
Life Insuranve Co., 0 N. Y. ', M7. If the subsequent part
of the charge, which is now referred to as discrediting Dr.
Baner's certificate as evidence of the facts stated in it, was regarded at the.trial as a modification of the defendant's eighth
proposition, or as objectionable in itself, the exception taken
should have been more specific. The attention of the court
should have been called to the particular point by something
more definite than the general exception taken. Beekwitk v.

IN ERROR TO THE

DISTRICT COURT

OF THE UNITEi)

STATES FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI.
Submitted October 22, 183.-Decided. November 17, 184.

That construction of a statute should be adopted which, without doing violence
to the fair meaning of the words used, brings it into harmony with the Constitution.
A municipal subscription to the stock of a railroad company, or in aid of the
construction of a railroad, made without authority previously conferred,
may be confirmed and legalized by subsequent legislative enactment, when
legislation of that character is not prohibited by the Constitution, and when
that which was done would have been legal had it been done under legislative sanetion previously given.

Suit upon county bonds. Judgment for plaintiff. Writ of
error to reverse it. The facts are stated in the opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

.Mr'. H. P. Branam for plaintiff in error.
-i'.Reuben, 0. Reynolds for defendant in error.
Mr. JusTIcE EAmT.A

delivered the opinion of the court.

This action was brought to recover the amount of certain
bonds and interest coupons issued under date of May 1, 1872,
in the name of Grenada County, Mississippi, by its board of
supervisors, and made payable to the Vicksburg & Nashville
Railroad Company, or beaxer, at its agency in the city of New
York. Each bond, signed by the president of the board and
countersigned by its clerk, with his official seal affixed, recites
that it is one of a series issued and delivered to the Vicksburg
& Nashville Railroad Company, by Grenada County, to meet
and pay off the amount subscribed by the county to the capital
stock of the railroad company aforesaid, "in pursuance of an
act of the legislature of the State of Mississippi, entitled 'An
Act to aid in the construction of the Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad,' now Yicksburg & Nashville Railroad, approved
February 10, 1860, and of an act amendatory thereof passed
March 25, 1871, and in obedience to a vote of the people of said
county at an election held in accordance with the provisions of
said acts."
The county disputes its liability on the bonds or coupons,
although the plaintiffs, who are defendants in error, became
holders for value, without notice of any defence except such as
the law implies. The defence rests mainly on the ground that
the subscription was made and the bonds issued without previgus legislative authority conferred in conformity with the Constitution of MIississippi.
The history of the issue of these securities, as disclosed by
legislative enactments, the proceedings of the board of supervisors of Grenada County, and the bill of exceptions, is substantially as will be now stated.
The Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad Company was
incorporated by an act approved February 6,1860, with power
to construct a railroad from Grenada, in Yallobusha County, to
Houston, in the county of Chickasaw, thence eastwardly to the

Alabama line, and with authority to connect or *consolidate
with any other company upon such terms as might be mutually
agreed upon, not inconsistent with the laws of the State.
Laws Miss. 1869-60, pp. 394-, 402. By the act approved February 10, 1860, the boards of police of Yallobusha, Calhoun,
Chickasaw and Monroe counties were authorized for their respective counties to subscribe, upon such terms as they saw
proper, to the caf)ital stock of the company, in an amount, not
exceeding $200,000 for any one county, to be paid by taxation;
provided, a majority of the qualified electors voting at an election held, for that purpose upon due notice should first assent
thereto; in which event, it was made the duty of the board to
make the subscription. Ib., 412.
On the 1st day of December, 1869, a new Constitution for
Missis.sippi went into operation, article 12, section 14 of which
declares that "the legislature shall not authorize any county, city
or town to become a stockholder in, or lend its credit to, any
company, association or corporation, unless two-thirds of the
qualified voters of such county, city or town, at a special election, or regular election, to be held therein, shall assent thereto."
On the 9th of May, 1870, the county of Grenada was created
out of parts of Yallobusha, Tallahatchie, Carroll and Choctaw
counties. Laws Miss. 1870, p. 124.
By an act approved March 25, 1871, amending the preceding
statutes, it was declared, among other things, that the act of
February 10, 1860, should apply in all its provisions to Grenada
County and its officers, and it was made the duty of the board
of supervisors of that and other counties' along the line of the
Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad, upon the petition of
twenty-five or more citizens, to cause an election to be held in
their respective counties to take the sense of the legal voters,
whether a sum not exceeding $200,000 to each county, shall be
subscribed to the capital stock of said railroad -company,to be
paid by taxation; also, that whenever, in the act of February
10, 1860, any duty is required of, or authorized to be performed
by, the boards of police, or the president thereof, of any of the
counties therein named, the same should apply to the board
of supervisors of the different counties and to the president

thereof; further, that "all such elections when held shall be
conducted in all things as required in the act of which this is
amendatory, and of the Constitution and laws of this State in
force at the time so held." ยง 1.
The fourth section authorizes the board of supervisors of any
county voting the tax, to issue bonds, maturing at such times,
not beyond ten years, and for such sums, as the board deemed
necessary, to pay off the subscriptions of said counties, respectively, for capital stock in the Grenada, Houston & Eastern
Railroad-the bonds to be signed by the president of the board
of supervisors issuing the same, and made payable to the company and their successors and assigns. The sixth section provides that bonds may be issued with interest coupons attached,
and, when issued, paid over and delivered to the railroad company in satisfaction of the subscription to the extent of the
principal of the bonds; the board taking from the company
certificates of stock for the shares paid for, and the stock to be
deemed the property of the municipality paying for it.
Under an order made by the board of supervisors of Grenada.,
in conformity with the petition of more than twenty-five of its
citizens, the question was submitted to the qualified voters, at
a general election held November 7, 1871, whether the board,
by its president, should subscribe, in behalf of that county,
$50,000 .to the capital stock of the Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad Company, and a like sum to the capital stock of
the "ricksburg & Grenada Railroad Company "-each subscription to be met and paid off in eight annual instalments,
with eight per cent. interest upon the amount due January 1,
1873, or from the date of the county bonds, if any should be
issued, payable annually by taxation upon the property of the
tax-payers. The board, at its December term, 1871, caused it
to be entered upon its records that the election had been duly
advertised and regularly held according to law; that "a constitutional majority of two-thirds of the legal and registered
voters of said county were cast"' for each subscription, and
that the board, by its president, "subscribe for $50,000 each-of
the capital stock of the Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad
Company and of the Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad Company,

GRENADA COUNTY SUPERVISORS v. BROGDEN. 265
Opinion of the Court.
for and on behalf of Grenada County, to be met and paid by'
taxation as aforesaid," &c.
When the election was held there was no such corporation
as the Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad Company; but the bill
of exceptions-setting out what the parties agree are the facts
established by the evidence-states, that "for a long time previous to said vote a scheme had been agitated in said county
for such a railroad, with its termini at Vicksburg and Grenada.,
as well as for the construction of the Grenada, Houston &
Eastern Railroad;
. .
and on the 3d day of January,
1872, the projectors and managers of the railroad, so designated
and intended in said vote, were incorporated by an act of the
legislature, entitled ' An Act to incorporate the Vicksburg,
Yazoo Valley & Grenada Railroad Company.'"
By an act approved January 27, 1872, the Grenada, Houston
& Eastern Railroad Company was authorized to extend their
road from Grenada via Yazoo City to Vicksburg, thus enabling
it to cover the route proposed to be occupied by the so-called
Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad, or the Vicksburg, Yazoo
Valley & Grenada Railroad. By the same act the name of
the Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad Company was
changed to that of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company, giving the company all the rights by the latter name
which it had under its old name.
Its 4th section is as follows:
"SEC. 4. Be et fierther enacted, That inaamuch " as the question of subscription or no subscription for fifty thousand dollars to aid in the construction of a railroad from Vicksburg to
Grenada, in this State, was, by the board of supervisors of
Grenada County, submitted to the qualified voters of Grenada
County, and the same was sustained by a majority of tiwothirds of the qualified voters of said county at a general election held therein on the 7th day of November, 1871, it shall
and may be lawful for the board of directors of the Vicksburg
& Nashville Railroad Company, by resolution made and entered in the minutes of said board at a regular meeting thereof,
sanctioned by a majority of said board of directors, to accept
all the provisions of this act, and adopt, as a part and portion

Opinion of the Court.

of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad- the extension specified in this act from Grenada to Vicksburg; and when, after
such acceptance and adoption, the said so-called Vicksburg &
Grenada Railroad shall form and constitute a part and portion
'of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad, and shall be constructed, owned, and held by the Vicksburg & Nashville
Railroad Company; and it shall be lawful for, and it is hereby
made the duty of the board of supervisors of Grenada County,
through the president of said board, upon the application of
the president or other authorized agent of the Vicksburg &
.Nashville
Railroad Company, to subscribe for fifty thousand
dollars of the capital stock of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company, based upon the submission to and the approval
of the vote of two-thirds of the qualified voters of said county,
which is hereby ratified and confirmed to the Vicksburg &
Nashville Railroad Company so heretofore had on behalf of
the Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad as aforesaid, and bonds of
said couity to secure the payment of said subscription for the
-stock and interest theeon, and also certificates of stock in said
company shall be used as in other cases provided for in this
act."
On the 5th of March, 1872, the Vicksburg, Yazoo Valley
& Grenada Railroad Company was consolidated with the
Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company, the articles of
consolidation binding the consolidated company-which retained- the name of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad
Company-anong other thingor; to construct the contemplated
road from Vicksburg to Grenada.
Subsequently, in the year 1872, the board of supervisors, by
its president,. executed and delivered to the Vicksburg and,
Nashville-'ailrgad Company bonds of the county (those in
suit behig 'a part.of them), in payment of the subscriptions
which. had been voted at the election in November, 1871, the
.county receiving certificates of stbck therefor. In 1872 and
1813 -te county assessed -and collected taxes to pby the cou-j0fis ifnurting at these respective periods on all the bonds in
suit. The coupons for those years have been fully paid. The
county by'iteidul r accredited agent, was represented at all the

Opinion of the Court.
stockholders' meetings of the company, and voted a stock subscription of $100,000. There has been no meeting of stockholders since 1874, nor of the directors since-July 6, 1875.
About five miles of the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad
westward from Okolona was graded and ironed. The iron so
laid was purchased from plaintiffs, and they received, in payment, the bonds in suit.
Under the acts in question, assuming them to be constitutional, the county had authority, upon- certain conditions, to
make a subscription to the capital stock of the Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad Company, now the Vicksburg &
Nashville Railroad Company, and its board of supervisors was
invested with power to determine whether those conditions
were performed, and, upon their being performed, to issue
bonds in payment of such subscription. According to the
settled doctrines of this court, the county is estopped, as
against the plaintiffs, to say that the conditions were not duly
performed; for, the recitals in the bonds import that they were
issued in pursuance of the acts of 1860 and 1871, and in obedience to a vote at an election held in accordance with the
provisions of said acts. Colona v. Eaves, 92 U. S. 484; Bvchanan v. Litehfeld, 102 U. S. 278; fforthern Bank v. Porter
Township, 110 U. S. 608, 617; Otoe County v. Baldwin, 111
U. S. 1. Upon this general question there seems to be no disagreement between this court and the Supreme Court of Mississippi. City of Vickesburg v. Lornbard, 51 Mississippi, 111,
126; Cutler v. Board of Supervlsars, 56 Mississippi, 115, 123.
But it is contended that the act of March 25, 1871, in violation of the Constitution of Mississippi, authorized-by its
reference to-the act of February 10, 1860-a'subscription upon
the assent thereto of a bare majority of its qualified electors
v 6 ting, and, consequently, the recitals in the bonds do not protect even a bona ftde holder. This is not, in our judgment, a
proper interpretation of that act. Its express requirement is
that elections to determine the question of subscriptions be held
and conducted, in all things, as required by the act of which it
is amendatorv, and by "the Constitution and laws of this State
in force at the time so held." As Grenada County came into

OCTOB ER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

existence after the Constitution of 1869 went into operation, it

could not, even under legislative sanction, make a valid subscription to the stock of a corporation unless two-thirds of
its qualified voters, at a special or general election, assented
thereto. That the legislature, when passing the act of 1871, had
in mind the constitutional provision relating to municipal subscriptions to the stock of corporations, is plain from the second
section of the act which authorizes certain incorporated towns,
including the town of Grenada, to subscribe to the stock of the
Grenada, Houston & Eastern Railroad Company, when such
subscription should be approved by "a constitutional majority
of two-thirds of the votes polled at an election regularly held"
-a provision which this court adjudged in Carroll County v.
s11 2'h, 111 U. S. 556, to be consistent with the Constitution of
Mississippi. It cannot be supposed that the legislature intended
to invest the town of Grenada with power to make a subscription when assented to by two-thirds of the eleptors voting;
and, in the same act, to invest the county with authority to
subscribe upon the assent of a bare majority of the electors
voting. And yet the argument imputes such diverse purposes
to the legislature of the State, if the act of 1871 be construed
as authorizing, in violation of the State Constitution, a county
subscription upon the assent of a bare majority of the electors
voting. The act of 1860 required twenty days' notice of the
.election, of the amount proposed to be subscribed, and in what
number of instalments to be paid. These provisions were left
untouched by the act of 1871. But the requirement in the latter act of conformity,-in all things, to the Constitution and laws
in force when the election was held, implies that the legislature
did not intend to authorize a municipal subscription upon the
-vote of a bare majority, but only upon the condition prescribed
in the Constitution, namely, a two-thirds majority of the electors
of the county.
It certairly cannot be said that a different construction is
required by the obvious import of the words of the statute.
But if there were room fc: two constructions, both equally obvious and reasonable, the court must, in deference to the legislature of the State, assume that it did not overlook the provisions

Opinion of the Court.
of the Constitution, and designed the act of 1871 to take effect.
Our duty, therefore, is to adopt that construction which, without
doing violence to the fair meaning of the words used, brings the
statute into harmony with the provisions of the Constitution.

v. ffay, 4 0.E. Green (19 N. J. Eq.) 245, 249. And such is the
rule recognized by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in -atarshall
v. Grimees, 41 Miss. 27, 31, in which it was said: "General words
in the act should not be so construed as to give an effect to it
beyond the legislative power, and thereby r*.nder the act unconstitutional. But, if possible, a construction should be given
to it that will render it free from constitutional objection, and
the presumption must be that the legislature intended to grant
such rights as were legitimately within its power." Again, in
Sykes v. AXayor, &c.,55 Mississippi, 115, 143: "It ought never
to be assumed that the law-making department of the government intended to usurp or assume power prohibited to it. And
such construction (if the words will admit of it) ought to be put
on its legislation as will make it consistent with the supreme
law."
It is worthy of observation that the board of supervisors of
Grenada County understood the act of 1871 as requiring conformity to the Constitution, for they were careful to make a
record of the fact that the proposed subscriptions had been
sustained by "a constitutional majority of two-thirds of the
legal and registered voters of said county."It results that, in respect of such of the bonds in suit as, according to the evidence, were issued in payment of the subscription to the stock of the Grenada, Houston & Eastern
Railroad Company, that there was valid legislative authority
as well for the subscription as for the issue of the bonds; consequently, the county is liable upon them.
It only remains to determine whether the county is liable
upon such of the bonds in suit as were delivered to the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company in discharge of the subscription of $50,000 voted in aid of the construction of the
. so-called Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad." We have seen

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

that when that subscription was voted there was no such
corporation as th6 Vicksburg & Grenada Railroad Company, but that the vote had reference to an organization or
scheme, the managers of which proposed to construct a railroad
connecting the cities of Grenada and Vicksburg; that these
managers were shortly thereafter incorporated as the Vicksburg, Yazoo Valley & Grenada Railroad Company, which
was subsequently, and before the bonds were issued, merged
in the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company. We have
also seen that the Vicksburg & Nashville Railroad Company
was empowered to construct a railroad from Grenada to Vicksburg, and, by the terms of the consolidation agreement with
the Vicksburg, Yazoo Valley & Grenada Railroad Company,
obligated itself to do so.
Such were the circumstances attending the passage of the
act of 1872, the fourth section of which confirmed and legalized
the action of the voters of Grenada County and its board of
supervisors in the matter of a county subscription in aid of the
construction of a railroad from Grenada to Yicksburg. The
evident purpose of that act was to give effect to the will of the
voters, as expressed at the election of 1871, by a majority large
enough, under any construction of the Constitution, as a basis
for a valid municipal subscription: to the stock of a railroad
corporation. The act of 1872 recites that the proposed subscription was approved by the requisite constitutional majority.
Had the action of the voters and of the board of supervisors
been taken under legislative authority previously conferred,
there could be no doubt of the validity of the subscription, or
of the power of the board of supervisors to issue bonds; for it is
to be observed, the State Constitution of 1869 does not prohibit
municipal subscriptions to the stock of railroad companies
under all circumstances, but only forbids the legislature from
authorizing them except where two-thirds of the qualified
voters of the municipality assent thereto. "It is not an open
question in this State," said the Supreme Court of Mississippi,
"that the legislature may authorize a county or town to aid a
railroad. That power was held to exist under the former Constitution, and the present Constitution distinctly recognized it."

GRENADA COUNTY SUPERVISORS v. BROGDEN. 271
Opinion of the Court.

Art. 12, ยง 4. . . . "If it were not for the constitutional
restriction, the legislature could authorize a county, city, or town
to aid in any of these modes railroads, or other rublie enterprises, without the assent of the qualified voters." -. 0., &e.,.
Raiload Co. v. .cDonald, 53 Miss. 246. Thus the Constitution recognized subscriptions to railr'ad companies as within the
scope of the powers which municipal corporations might exercise under legislative sanction. While the legislature could not,
after the adoption of the Constitution of 1869, have legalized a
municipal subscription assented to by a less majorityof legal
voters than is prescribed in that instrument, its power, by retrospective enactment, to confirm and legalize a municipal subscription to the stock of a railroad corporation to which the
constitutional majority of electors had assented at an election
of which due notice was given, cannot we think, be successfully
disputed. Since what was done in this case by the constitutional majority of qualified electors, and by the board of supervisors of the county, would have been legal and binding upon
the county had it been done under legislative authority previously conferred, it is not perceived why subsequent legislative
ratification is not, in the absence of constitutional restrictions
upon such legislation, equivalent to original authority. In.
Sy7qkes-v. -Jfayor, &c., of Colurbus, 55 Miss. 115, 137, it was
held that, after the Constitution of 1869 took effect, the legislature could not, by retrospective enactment, make valid an issue
of municipal bonds executed prior to the adoption of that
instrument without legislative authority; because, said the
court, "the measure of its power was the Constitution of
December, 1869, and- it could not ratify an act previously
done, if at the date it professed to do so, it could not confer
power to do it in the first instance. It could authorize a municipal loan conditionally. In order to ratify and legalize a
loan previously made, it was bound by the constitutional limitation of its power." Further, in the same case: "The idea
implied in the ratification of a municipal act performed without previous legislative authority is, that the ratifying communicates authority, which relates back to, and retrospectively
vivifies and legalizes, the act, as if the power had been previ-

ously given.

Such statute is of the same import as original

authority. . . . If the Constitution had altogether denied
to the legislature the delegation of such power to counties,
cities, and towns, it is manifest that it could not vitalize and
legalize a subscription made before its adoption, and without
authority of law. If that be so, it follows that, in dealing with
the subject at all, it is bound by the limitation of section 14 of
article 12 of the Constitution."
In Cutter v. Boardof Supervis rs, 56 Miss. 115, the que;tion
was as to the power of the legislature to ratify and legalize certain municipal bonds issued to a railroad corporation by a
county board of supervisors, in pursuance of a vote of the
people, with interest coupons attached, payable semi-annually.
The statute under which the board proceeded authorized bonds
with interest payable annually. The people, however, voted
for bonds with interest payable semi-annually. The court sustained the constitutionality of the curative act. It was said:
"This is far from being an effort to impose a debt on the county
without its consent. The agreement of the people of the county
to incur the debt, in the precise shape which it assumed, has
been expressed. Their representatives, the county authorities,
in execution of that will, have delivered the bonds and the legislature afterwards affirmed. , If there has been any departure
from the letter of the original authority, it acquiesces in such
deviation, cures the irregularity, and makes valid the bonds.
The principles announced in Superviso 's v. Sc1lenek, 5 Walt.
772, 76, 789, fully support these views."
These doctrines are in aceord with the views of this court as
indicated in several cases. Ritckie v. Franklin,22 Wall. 167;
Thompsorm v. Lee County, 3 Wall. 327; City v. Lamson, 9 Wall.
477, 485 ; St. Joseph v. .iogers, 16 Wall. 644, 663 ; Capnbellv.
City of lfenosha, 5 Wall. 194.
Our conclusion is that the act of 1872, requiring bonds of
Grenada County to be issued to the Vicksburg & Nashville
Railroad Company in payment of the subscription voted in
1871 by the constitutional majority of its voters, for a railroad
from Grenada to Vicksburg, is not in conflict with the Constitution of Mississippi. Consequently, there is no ground upon

which the county can escape liability upon them to the plaintiffs, who are boncflde holders for value. Indeed, there is nothing of substance in the defence made by the county beyond
the question of legislative authority for the subscriptions, in
payment of which the bonds in suit were issued, and pa, sed to
the plaintiffs for iron used on one of the proposed roads.
Other questions of minor importanc6 are discussed in the very
able brief of counsel for the county. But they do not, in our
opinion, affect the right of plaintiffs to judgment, and need not
be noticed.
