SKIDMORE v. PITTSBURG, CIN. & ST. LOUIS R'Y CO. 33
Statement of Facts.

SKIDMORE & Others v. PITTSBURG, CINCINNATI &
ST. LOUIS RAILWAY COMPANY.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Submitted October 17, 1694.-Decided October 2?, 1884.

The legal title to real estate acquired subsequent to the lease by a lessor owning the equitable title at the date of the lease, inures to the benefit of the
lessee as against a jud,-ment creditor of the lessor whose judgment is subsequent to the lease.

This was an action of ejectment, and the material facts
found by the court below, on -'hich the case comes here for
decision, were as follows: Ih the spring of 1868, the Columbus,
Chicago and Indiana Central Railroad Company purchased the
premises in dispute upon time contracts, by which the purchase
money was to be fully paid within four years and a conveyance'made when the payments were completed. Immediately
on making the purchase the company went into possession of
the premises, "and erected thereon its engine houses and certain shops, structures, and side tracks necessary for tht operation of its railroad." On the 1st of February, 1869, the
Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Railway Company "became
the lessee of the railway and property of the C., 0. & I. C.
Ry. Co. for the term of ninety-nine years, and immediately
thereafter entered into the possession of said railroad and all its
lands and property, including the property in controversy."
The lease was recorded in Cook County, Illinois, where the
premises are situated, on the 21st of July, 1873. It did not
purport to convey after-acquired property, but the premises in
question were, and since the lease was made have been, occupied and used by the lessee for railway purposes "the same as
though they were included in the lease."
On the 2nd of February, 1872, the purchase money having
been paid in full, according to the terms of the contract, a deed
was executed conveying the premises to the Columbus, Chicago
and Indiana Central Company in fee simple. On the 19thof

April; 1873, William B. Skidmore, since deceased, recovered a
judgment against the last named company in the Cook County
Circuit Court. Execution, issued-on this judgment, was levied
on the premises on the 10th of June,-1873. Under this execution the property was sold to William B. Skidmore on the 10th
of July, and a conveyance made to Harriet Skidmore, Lemuel
Skidmore and William B. Skidmore, his heirs, in due course of
'proceeding, on the 3d of May, 1876. 'The heirs, who are the
plaintiffs in error, claiming under this title, brought this suit
against the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company, which
wAs in possession, to recover the property. Upon these facts
the court below gave judgment in favor of the railway company, and to reverse that judgment this writ of error was
brought.

an outstanding title that a stranger can take advantage of it to
defeat a recovery by the mortgagor or one claiming under
him. Hall v. Lanee, 25 Ill. 277. A parol contract relating to

OCTOBER TERM, '1884.
Syllabus.
MR. C=IF JUSTICE WArTE delivered the opinion

of the

court. lHe stated the facts in the foregoing language and continued:
The judgment below was clearly right. The Columbus,
Chicago &, Indiana Central Company was, in equity, the
owner of the property when the lease was made and when the
Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company went into possession under it. The deed executed in February, 1872, pursuant to the contract of purchase, converted the equitable title of
the Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Company into a
legal title, which at once, by operation of law, inured to the
benefit of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company
under its lease. All the rights of William B. Skidmore, as
against- the property, accrued long after those of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Company and are subject to the
title of that company. Such being the case, it is entirely
unnecessary to inquire whether the Skidmores acquired a valid
title to the property as against the Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Company. The Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St.
Louis Company is entitled to the possession, whether that title
be good or bad.

IN

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.
Submitted April 14, 1834.-Decided October 27, 1884.

An order awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus which directs the collector of taxes of a county to collect a tax that had been duly levied and extended on the county tax books is a final judgment subject to review when
the other conditions exist.
The power to review the judgment in a proceeding for mandamus to enforce the
collection of a tax to pay all judgment creditors of a specified class, depends
upon the amount of the whole tax ordered to be collected, and not upon
the amount of the judgment debts due to each or any individual petitioner.
