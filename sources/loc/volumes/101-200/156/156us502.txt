NATIONAL CASH REGISTER COMPANY v. BOSTON

CASH INDICATOR AND RECORDER COMPANY
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 155. Argued January 1, 1895. - Decided March 4, 1895.

Letters patent No. 271,363, issued January 30, 1883, to James Ritty and
John Birch for a cash register and indicator, are valid, and are infringed
by the defendant's machine.
THIS was a bill in equity for the infringement of letters
patent No. 271,363, issued January 30, 1883, to James Ritty
and John Birch for a "cash register and indicator."
The invention, as stated in the specification "Relates to an improvement in cash registers and indicators
designed for the use of storekeepers and others as a means of
accurately registering the total cash receipts for any given
period of time - as a day, for instance - and for indicating
to the customers that the amount paid has been registered
by disclosing to their view such amounts upon figured tablets.
"The arrangements of the parts and operation of the
machine are such that no tablet can be exhibited without its
value being counted upon the registering mechanism, and
whenever any tablet is disclosed it remains so until the
machine is operated to disclose a second tablet.
"The novelty of our invention consists in the construction,
combinations, and arrangements of the various parts, as will
be herewith set forth and specifically claimed."
The following drawing exhibits such particulars of the
patent as are pertinent to this suit

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Statement of the Case.

The material parts of the specification are as follows
"We provide any suitable box or case, A, ornamejited as
desired, and of the general shape indicated, though its shape
and ornamentation may be varied infinitely In this outer
case is fitted a metal framework, consisting chiefly of two
upright sides, B, united by a cross-bar, 0,and by the shafts
and bars which support the operating mechanism.
"In the lower portion of the frame, and extending horizontally across it, is a rod or shaft, D, supported by and aiding to
connect the sides B of the frame. Upon this shaft are hung a
series of parallel keys, E, of metal, made heavier m the rear,
so as to remain in and return to the position indicated in Fig. 1
by their gravity alone, without the use of springs or other
devices. In the present instance twenty of these keys are
shown, though any number may be employed. Each key has
upon its front end, which extends through and projects from
an opening in the front of the case or frame, a button, o, having
marked upon it a figure to correspond with the value intended

Statement of the Case.

to be indicated and registered whenever that key is operated
by depressing the button. In a machine with twenty keys
the first button to the left would be numbered 5, the second
10, and the third 15, to represent five, ten, and fifteen cents,
and so on progressively As these buttons are about threequarters of an inch in diameter, it would make the machine
unnecessarily wide to arrange the whole series side by side in
one bank, so we have arranged them in two banks, the one
above the other.
The rear end of each key is flattened and slotted at its outer end, so as to embrace vertical
guide-pins b, set in the bar C, and which aid the shaft D in
preventing lateral play or twist of the keys.
"Resting upon the flattened ends of the keys are vertical
metal rods F - one for each key - which pass and have vertical play through perforations in metal guide-bars G, extending
across and supported by the sides B. These rods may be any
shape in cross-section, though we prefer to make them square,
with square perforations in the guide-bars G. The upper portion of each rod, just above the upper bar G, is bent to form a
knuckle or shoulder, d, upon its rear side, which has bevelled
or inclined operating faces, for a purpose to be presently
explained.
"Suitably secured to the top of each rod is a tablet, H, of
thin flat metal, and upon the face of each tablet is a number
corresponding with the number upon the key over whose rear
end the rod of that tablet rests.
"Thus the tablet of the rod resting upon the key whose
button is marked 5 is likewise marked 5, and so on through
the series. In order to get the tablets into as narrow a space
as possible, and thus not make the machine wider than necessary, their stems are bent so that the tablets can overlap each
other as shown in Fig. 4, and yet each can be operated without interfering with another.
"In the upper portion of the case is a large horizontal opening extending across the front of the case and covered with
transparent glass e, Fig. 1, and when the keys are in their
normal position of rest, with the rods F resting upon their rear
ends, all of the tablets are hidden from view below the lower

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Statement of the Case.

edge of the openng e, but when any key is pressed down by
means of its button the rod of that key is raised and its tablet
exposed to view through the glass e.
"In Figs. 1 and 4 one of the tablets is thus shown raised up
and exposed to view Now, it is an important feature of our
machine that after a key has been operated and its tablet
exposed to view such tablet shall remain up and exposed until
another key is operated, whereupon the first falls back out of
view and the second remains exposed, and so on, thus always
keeping in view the tablet of the key last operated. To effect
this result we pivot, by means of trunnions or a shaft extending between the sides B, a forwardly-inclined wing, I, pivoted
at its lower edge, as atf, and resting at its upper edge against
the rear sides of the upper portions of the rods F This wing
extends back of all of the rods, and is free to vibrate on its pivotal axis f
It is yieldingly held against the rods by any suitable spring, a spiral spring being shown for that purpose in
Fig. 2, secured at one end of the wing and to the side B of the
frame. Just on the inner sides of the frames B, and pivoted
upon the shaft D, are fiat arms J, extending upward and rearward and downward and forward of their pivotal points. The
front ends of these arms extend into the opening made for the
keys m the front of the case A, and are connected by a bar
K, extending entirely across this opening and resting up
against the under sides of all the keys. Of course when any
one of the keys is depressed the bar K is likewise carried
down, and the upper portions of the arms J are vibrated forward.
To return the bar J when the key is released,
and to assist the key itself to return, any suitable spring may
be employed.
"Pivoted at Aupon the right-hand side of the frame B, Fig.
1, is a bell-crank tripping-arm, L, with the rear end rounded
and resting against the upper portion of the front side of the
wing I. Its vibration is limited by two pins or detents, z, as
shown, and upon the same pivot, A, is hung a follower, j,
whose lower end extends below the elbow of the bell-crank, and
whose rear edge rests against a shoulder, k, upon the bellcrank. The lower end of this follower has a bevelled en-

gaging-nose, 1,against which the upper end of a trigger, m,
pivoted at or near its middle, as at o, to the side B rests.
The lower end of this trigger is connected to the upper end
of the arm J on that side of the machine by a link, p. The
opposite arm
is connected by a similar link to similar tripping mechanism for operating the hammer of a bell or
gong, which is secured in any suitable manner to the side of
the frame.
"Now, the operation of thus much of the machine is as
follows When any key is pressed down its rod and tablet
are raised, and the elbow d of the rod, in rising, aids in pressing back the wing I, but to aid the elbow the arm J on the
right, which, as before explained, is drawn forward whenever
a key is pressed, imparts motion to the link p and trigger in,
whose upper end, acting on the nose 1 of the follower j,
presses it back, and with it the bell-crank L, which is thus
forced against the wing and presses it back. Now, the parts
are so arranged that when the lower sIde of the elbow d is
just above the top edge of the wing the key has completed its
downward stroke, and is arrested by the front bar N of the
case, the trigger in has passed beyond the nose 1 of the bellcrank, so that the latter swings back out of the way, and
the spring a' draws the wing forward under the elbow d,
so that the latter rests upon the upper edge, as seen at b', Figs.
1 and 2, and there remains, thus retaining the tablet and rod
of the operated key elevated. Now, upon releasing the key
itfalls backward to its normal position by gravity, and is
aided by the spring g, Fig. 2, which returns the bar 1 and
arms J The follower y, being free to swing forward without moving the bell-crank, permits the trigger m to flip it up
and pass under its nose to its normal position. During this
operation the opposite arm
has in like manner actuated the hammer of the gong, which is sounded every time a
key is depressed to its farthest limit, and only then, and thus
gives notice to the customer that the machine has been properly operated. Whenever the same key is successively oper
ated its rod and the tablet remain up and exposed to view,
but when a different key is operated the tablet of the pre-.

vious one is released and falls back out of sight, and the tablet
of the operated key remains up and exposed."
The remainder of the specification relates to the registering
or recording mechanism which is not in issue here. The only
claim alleged to have been infringed is the first, which reads
as follows
"1. In a registering and indicating machine, the combination, with a series of indicating-tablets operated by a. series of
keys, of a series of rods, each provided with a detent or shoulder and carrying one of the aforesaid tablets, and a supportingwing with connecting mechanism, whereby upon operating
any one of the keys the wing is so moved as to permit the
passage of the rod, and whereby upon the release of the keys.
the wing engages with and holds up the tablet-rod and

The answer put in issue principally the question of infringement, and, upon a hearing upon pleadings and proofs, the

MR. JUsTicE BnowN, after stating the case, delivered the
opimon of the court.

In the past fifteen years, cash registers have become extensively used in retail shops, where each sale is small in amount,
such as drug stores, cigar stands, restaurants, and other small
establishments, for the purpose of affording a convenient deposit for the cash received, and of preserving a record of every
sale made during each day, and of the amount received therefor. The correspondence between the amount indicated by
the register and the amount in the drawer shows whether each
sale has been properly accounted for. It thus enables the.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

proprietor to ascertain at the close of each day's business the
amount of sales, and also operates as a check upon the dishonesty of clerks who are held accountable for the amount of
money indicated by the register.
To fulfil all its requirements, the cash register and indicator
should perform the following functions
1. It should register the number of sales. This is done
upon somewhat the same principle as a steam engine records
its own revolutions.
2. It should also register the amount of each sale, and to
this end it is provided with a series of keys representing different amounts from five cents to five dollars, by the pressure of
which keys a corresponding amount is registered, and added
to the previous aggregate of small amounts upon a revolving
cylinder.
3. It should also indicate to the customer the proper
amount of his purchase by exposing a tablet containing such
amount in large figures, which tablet should remain in sight
until the next sale is made. If the amount of such sale is a
dollar and a fraction of another dollar, two such tablets are
exposed, the aggregate of which represents the proper amount.
It is necessary in each case that the tablet should remain exposed until another key is touched, when it ought to disappear,
that the next customer may recognize the amount of his purchase. The customer is thus made to a certain extent an involuntary detective of the action of the clerk making the sale.
4. The pressure upon the key should also ring a bell, to call
the attention of the customer to the exposed indicator or
tablet.
5. The pressure of the key is also intended to unlock, and by
the aid of a spring, to throw open, the money drawer, which
should be shoved back and closed after each sale is made.
6. In some machines a record is made of the number of
times the lid is opened, that the proprietor may know whether
the box has been tampered with.
If the mechanism does its work properly, it should operate
as a complete check upon any attempt at embezzlement, by
the salesman, of the funds.

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Opinion of the Court.

The patent in suit covers the registering or recording, as
well as the indicating mechamsm, but as the only claim of
the patent alleged to be infringed deals with the indicating
mechanism alone, no further reference to the other features
of the patent is necessary This mechanism consists of keys,
E, having figures representing values upon their front ends, o,
and hinged upon a horizontal shaft, D, extending across the
machine. The rear end of each key is flattened and slotted
to receive the lower ends of vertical rods, F, carrying tablets,
H, which are labelled with a figure corresponding with that
upon the key The depression of the front ends of the keys
raises the rear ends, together with the rods attached thereto,
and brings the tablet into view Back of these rods is a wing,
I, pivoted at its lower edge,f, inclined forward, and resting
at its upper edge against the rear sides of the upper parts of
the rods F Each rod contains an elbow or projection, d,
which, as the rod rises, presses back the wing I, and when the
pressure is taken off the key, the elbow catches upon the upper
side of the wing, and thus holds the tablet up and exposed to
view until the key is depressed again, when the wing is again
pressed back, the elbow is relieved, and the tablet falls.
To secure a more perfect operation of this wing, a bar, K,
is extended across and directly underneath the front ends of
the keys, so that whenever any key is depressed this bar is
also depressed. Connected with this bar is a train of mechanISm, which appears in the drawing and is described in the
specification, but which is not necessary to be set out here in
full. This mechanism operates directly upon the wing I, and
secures beyond peradventure the falling of the tablet, before.
the elbow of the next tablet rod has passed the upper edge of
the wing. This subsidiary train of mechanism, operating directly upon the wing, and independently of the elbow in the
rods, is the special feature of the Ritty and Birch patent.
To answer satisfactorily the question of infringement, it is
necessary to refer to the state of the art, and to distinguish
that which was already well known at the date of this patent,
from that which Ritty and Birch contributed by their invention. While the novelty of their device is not directly at-

Opinion of the Court.

tacked, it is claimed that, in view of certain prior patents,
their patent is subject to limitations which affect materially
the construction of the first claim, and show defendant's machine not to be an infringement.
The earliest patent to which our attention is called, and
which may be said to represent the infancy of the art, is that
to James Russell, October 10, 1829, for an improvement in
bell hanging. This patent, which was issued long before electricity was put to any serviceable use, was intended to be employed in hotels or other buildings, where a series or row of
bells had theretofore been used to connect each room with the
office. These bells had been hung upon wires or springs, and,
when rung, oscillated long enough to call the attention of the
attendant to the number of the room with which they were
connected. The Russell patent substituted, for the familiar
row of bells in the office, a single bell, in a box, with a series
of indicators or tablets which protruded from grooves in the
box as each bell was sounded. These indicators were mounted
upon notched plates of metal, and as each indicator was pulled
out by its wire, the plate was caught by a pivoted wing or bar,
and the tablet held outside of the box until the next bell was
sounded, when it fell back to its place. The wing co5perated
with the notch in the metallic plate of the tablet precisely as
the wing in the Ritty and Birch patent coperates with the
elbow of the tablet rod, and holds it up until the next tablet
is raised. The wing is an obvious anticipation of that in the
Ritty and Birch patent, and the whole device differs from it in
principle, only in the absence of the connecting mechanism
between the keys and the pivoted wing.
The British patent to Henry Pottin of May 28, 1877, for a
cash register exhibits, in place of the pivoted wing of the Russell patent, a sliding bar operated by keys. This sliding bar
is moved aside by a shoulder in each tablet rod as the rod is
raised. After the shoulder has passed a cobperating latch or
trip-lever, pivoted upon the bar, the latter is brought back to
its position by a spring, and the tablet remains exposed to
view When the key is again depressed, another tablet rod
rises, but before its shoulder has passed the co~perating latch

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Opinion of the Court.

the first tablet falls upon the latch, which gives way to allow
the rod to fall, when the last rod rises and remains exposed to
view These latches are weighted in such manner as to remain
m place as the rod rises, but to give way when it is desired that
the rod shall fall. The device is an ingenious one, but is chiefly
valuable in this connection as showing that, prior to the Ritty
and Birch patent, the sliding bar was well known as an equivalent for the pivoted wing. The device of the latches to aid
in moving the bar as the tablet rod rises, and to give way at
the proper moment to allow the rod to fall, as the next one
rises, contains a suggestion of the connecting mechanism of
the iRitty and Birch patent, but is in no sense an anticipation of it. It was intended, as in the Ritty and Birch machine,
to release with certainty the exposed tablet, when another one
was lifted, and it appears to accomplish that result satisfactorily, but by a wholly different means from that employed by
IRitty and Birch. Each tablet rod requires a separate weighted
latch, and in case of a large number of keys would take up
too much room to be conveniently available as a cash register.
It is subject to another difficulty, that if two keys are depressed
at once, and their corresponding rods are lifted and caught
upon -the supporting bar, indicating a sale represented by two
tablets combined, a subsequent operation of either one of
these keys will fail to release either indicator, and both will
remain exposed to view The shoulders of both rods are
above and resting upon the supporting bar, and as those
shoulders are the only thing that can move the bar, the latter
can be moved and the tablets allowed to fall only by the operation of some other key
The patent to Michael Campbell of February 14, 1882,
exhibits a modification of the Pottin sliding bar, the tablets
-consisting of metal plates sliding up and down between
grooves, each tablet having at its upper end a horizontal
finger, which engages with a swinging hook. These hooks
are all fitted in slots of a transverse sliding bar, mounted at
either end in guides upon the wall of the casing, and actuated
in one direction by a spring, and in the other by the pressure
of the hooks, which are thus caught by the horizontal finger

Opinion of the Court.

of the tablet. The tablet rods are raised by the key levers,
with which they are connected by cords and pulleys at their
rear ends. Whenever any tablet is raised by depressing the
front end of the key, the finger on its upper end is caught by
the hook above it, the sliding bar moved against the spring,
and the tablet thereby held up. When another key is depressed, and its tablet lifted into engagement with its hook,
the latter, through the medium of the sliding bar connecting
all the hooks, disengages the first tablet, and permits it to
drop out of view It differs from the Pottin machine in the
manner in which the sliding bar is operated, and resembles
the Ritty and Birch patent only in the fact that the tablets
are raised by the rear ends of the keys acting in connection
with the vertical rods, although even this connection is indirect through the intervention of cords and pulleys. It may
well be doubted whether this patent exhibits a practically
operative combination, since the mechanism is somewhat
complicated, and apparently liable to get out of order. The
patent covers not only this indicating device, but a mechanism for opening the drawer automaticallv, and although the
patent is owned by the plaintiff, it has never used its indicating mechanism, and the statement of the inventor himself
is that the original model is the only machine containing such
mechanism that was ever built.
Other patents were put in evidence by the defendant having
a relation more or less remote to the patent in suit, but designed rather to show that some form of connecting mechanism had been previously used for other purposes- such, for
instance, as ringing the bell at the other side of the machine,
moving the carriage of a typewriter, or opening the cash
drawer, all by means of a common bar extending above or
beneath the whole line of keys, the depression of any one of
which not only performs its individual function of raising a
tablet, printing its particular letter upon a typewriter, or
registering an amount corresponding to that indicated upon
the face of the key, but also depresses a common bar, which
operates this mechanism. Indeed, it must be admitted that it
was no longer new in the art that each key should perform

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR 00.
Opinion of the Court.

not only its individual work of adding, writing, or indicating,
but also that all the keys should perform some one common
operation. In none of the prior patents, however, is there
such a connecting mechanism for the purpose indicated in the
Ritty and Birch patent.
To sum up the state of the art, then, at the date of the
Ritty and Birch patent The use of keys to raise vertical rods
carrying tablets was not only well known, but lies at the
foundation of every cash register to which our attention has
been called. It was also old to use a pivoted wing or bar to
catch a projection or elbow of the vertical rod. for the purpose
of holding the tablet exposed to view, until another tablet
was raised. So, too, the use of a sliding bar actuated in one
direction by a spring and in the other by a projection from the
vertical rod or its tablet, was a recognized equivalent of the
pivoted wing. And, finally, a connecting mechanism operated
by each one of the keys by means of a bar over or underneath
them had been previously used for ringing the bell, opening
the cash drawer, and in other machines for other purposes.
What then was the contribution of this patent to the art
It was found that not only must the machine be constructed
with extreme and almost impossible accuracy in order to
operate as desired, relying on the shoulders alone to move the
wing, but that, when the machine was put to use, some of the
keys would be used much oftener than others, and the shoulders on the tablet rods belonging to these keys would become
worn so that, when one of these keys was operated immediately
after one that was less frequently used, the shoulder on its rod
would not move the wing back far enough to release the
tablet rod of the infrequently used key, which was resting on
the wing. So, too, any accumulation of dust, dirt, or oil upon
the projections or bar would render their operation uncertain.
The consequence was that two tablets might be in view of the
customer at the same time. This not only failed to indicate
to the customer the amount of his purchase, but afforded to
the salesman an opportunity of deceiving the proprietor as to
the actual amount of his sales. Indeed, it requires no expert
to see that where all the rods are constructed alike, and the

Opinion of the. Court.

fall of one rod is made to depend exclusively upon the elevation of another the mechanism would soon become so worn
as to be inoperative. To obviate this, Ritty and Birch subdivided the power exerted by the keys in the operation of the
pivoted wing, and caused such wing to be put in motion not
only by the elbow of the rod, but by the simultaneous,
though wholly independent, action of a bell-crank lever, which
receives its impulse from the bar beneath the keys, and, with
its other arm, shoves back the upper side of the wing far
enough to permit the tablet to fall and resume its original
position in time to suffer the wing to fall back and catch the
elbow of the last tablet rod, and hold it up. It is insisted,
however, that, as the connecting mechanism had been previously used upon the other side of the machine to ring the bell
and to open the cash drawer, the employment of a similar
mechanism for actuating the pivoted wing was a case of mere
double use, and, if patentable at all, must be restricted to the
exact device used, and cannot be construed to cover a similar
train of mechanism for moving the sliding bar.
It did, however, require thought to conceive the idea (1)
that a remedy for the existing defects in the machine lay in
the independent operation of the wing, and (2) that such
operation could be secured by a mechanical connection with
the keys. Given these conceptions, it was more a matter of
mechanical skill than of invention to devise such connection,
since a similar train of mechanism had been operated by the
keys for other purposes. It is insisted, however, that, inasmuch as such mechanical connection was well known before,
and had been used for analogous purposes, it is a mere case of
double use to employ a similar contrivance to actuate the
wing. While the use was to a certain extent an analogous
one and the mechanism was probably suggested by that
employed to ring the bell, there was nothing to suggest that
the object to be attained, viz., the more perfect action of the
tablet rods, could be accomplished by subdividing the force
exerted by the keys, and bringing a portion of their power to
bear directly upon the wing itself instead of devoting the
whole of such power to the act of raising the rods, and

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Opinion of the Court.

depending solely upon the elbows of the rods to operate the
wing. There is no conflict here with the principle laid down
by this court in Enapp v llforss, 150 U S. 221, 227, and
IWoZlensak v Sargent, 151 U. S. 227, that the end or purpose
sought to be accomplished by a device is not the subject of a
patent, but only the new and useful means for obtaining that
end, since the end or purpose to be accomplished in this case
was not the moving of the wing, but the more perfect operation of the rods, and the means used to accomplish it was a
subdivision of the power exerted by the keys, and the application of a portion of it directly to the wing itself. The
fallacy of defendant's argument in this connection lies in the
assumption that the object to be accomplished was the moving
of the wing, whereas this was only a means for the ultimate
purpose, viz., the more satisfactory operation of the rods. Indeed, this use of the connecting mechanism can hardly be
termed analogous to such as similar mechanisms had been
previously used for, but even if it were, the results aTe so
important, and the ingenuity displayed to bring them about
is such that we are not disposed to deny the patentees the
merit of invention. The combination described in the first
claim was clearly new
The cases cited by defendant upon the subject of double
use are not-applicable, such, for instance, as Brown v Pzper,
91 U. S. 37, in which a claim for preserving fish and other
articles in a closed chamber by means of a freezing mixture,
was held to have been anticipated by a similar patent for preserving bodies, and also by the ordinary ice-cream freezer,
Pennsylvanta Railroad v. Locomotive Truck Oompany, 110
U. S. 490, in which a patent for employing a certain truck
for locomotive engines was held to be invalid in view of the
employment of a similar truck for railroad cars, Aron v
7fManhattan Railroad Co:, 132 U S. 81, wherein a patent
for simultaneously opening two gates at the end of two adjoining passenger coaches was held invalid in view of previous
patents for opening a single gate, and devices to open and
close apertures at a distance from the operator Wollensak v
Sargent, 151 U. S. 221, wherein a patent for opening and

closing a transom over a door by means of a vertical rod was
held to have been anticipated by a patent for opening and
closing a series of passenger car ventilators or transoms by a
horizontal rod, Blake v San Financzsco, 113 U S. 679, wherein
the adaptation of an automatic valve, previously known and in
use to a steam fire engine, was held not to involve invention,
and St. Germa'in v Bpunswwtk, 135 U S. 227, wherein a revolving rack for billiard cues was held to be anticipated by
such revolving contrivances as dining-tables and bottle castors.
In all these cases the prior uses were such obviously analogous
ones that there could be no doubt of the invalidity of the
patent.
In the defendant's machine the sliding bar of the Campbell
and Pottin patents is substituted for the pivoted wing of the
Russell and the Ritty and Birch patents, but, as before observed, they were well-known equivalents for each other, and
the mechanism by which they had theretofore been operated
was also well known. They were apparently subject to certain
defects in their operation, which impaired their efficiency, and
required the use of an independent means to secure the release
of the first rod before the second one was raised into place.
Whether this were done by the simultaneous action of the
elbow of the rod and that of the connecting mechanism upon
the wing, as in the Ritty and Birch patent, or by the prior
action of such mechanism, as in defendant's device, is immaterial, so long as such action is independent of the action of
the rods themselves. We have already stated how this was
accomplished by the Ritty and Birch patent. Defendant also
employed a universal bar operated by each key, corresponding with the bar K of plaintiff's patent, but located above the
keys instead of beneath them, and back of the shaft upon
which the keys are pivoted instead of in front of it. The
operation of the keys is, therefore, to raise this bar instead of
depressing it. A rod projecting from the end of this bar engages with the arm of a bell-crank lever, the other arm of
which is so connected with an arm of the sliding bar projecting downwards that the depression of the key moves the bar
to one side far enough to release the tablet rod already

CASH REG. CO. v. CASH INDICATOR CO.
Opinion of the Court.

raised before the lug on the second or rising rod has passed
the sliding bar. When the second rod has risen to its full
height, the sliding bar is released from the action of the bellcrank lever, and is drawn back to its place by a spring, in
time to hold the second rod up by a lug on the bar, corresponding to the lug on the rod. The operation of the two
devices is the same, except that in the Ritty and Birch patent
the action of the connecting mechanism in pushing back the
pivoted wing is simultaneous with, and to a certain extent
aided by, the elbow of the rod, while in defendant's device the
action of the connecting mechanism in moving the bar is
exclusive of any assistance from the rod. But, as already
observed, this simultaneous action is a wholly immaterial
feature of the Ritty and Birch patent. While the details of
the defendant's machine are quite different from that of the
plaintiff, the underlying principle of releasing the first tablet
before, or simultaneously with, the elevation of the second
tablet by the aid of an independent train of mechanism put in
motion by the depression of the key, is precisely the same.
This principle being already known, the contrivance of a connecting mechanism which should operate to move a sliding
bar as the pivoted wing of the Ritty and Birch patent was
moved, was a comparatively easy matter, though, perhaps,
involving invention to a limited degree. In a word, there
were two known methods of accomplishing the same result a pivoted wing and a sliding bar. Ritty and Birch invented a
train of mechanism to operate the pivoted wing, defendant
adopted a similar method to operate a sliding bar. Had defendant also invented the sliding bar and applied this mechanism to it, the case would have fallen within our ruling in
Aron v -lanhattan, Railroad Co., as the adoption of a different means of accomplishing the same result. But the means
in this case being well-known equivalents for each other, we
think the charge of infringement is made out.
The decree of the court below is, therefore,
Reversed, and the case remandedfor furtherproceedings mz
conformity with this opsnson.
