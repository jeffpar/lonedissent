OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

BELL SILVER AND COPPER MINING COMPANY
v. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF BUTTE.
ERROR TO AND APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF MONTANA.
No. 154.

Argued January 16, 17, 1895.-

Decided March 4, 1895.

A provision, in a deed of real estate in trust to secure the payment of a
debt, which authorizes the trustee to sell the property at auction on breach
of condition, first giving thirty days' notice of the time and place of sale
by advertising the same for three successive weeks in a newspaper, is
complied with so far as respects notice, by publication of such notice
for three successive weeks, the first publication being more than thirty
days before the day of sale.
If such notice describes the property to be sold in the language of the
mortgage, it is sufficient.
A trust deed in the nature of a mortgage may confer upon the trustee power
to sell the premises on default in the payment of the debt secured by the
deed, and a sale thereunder, conducted in accordance with the terms of
the power in the deed, will pass the granted premises to the purchaser
on its consummation by conveyance; and this rule obtains in Montana,
notwithstanding the provisions in ยง 371 of its Revised Statutes.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is before us on appeal from a judgment of the
Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana, affirming a
judgment of one of its district courts.
The original action in the district court was ejectment
commenced by the plaintiffs in Silver Bow County for the
possession of two mining claims situated therein. It was

tried by the court without the intervention of a jury upon
certain agreed facts in the nature of a special verdict.
It appears by them that on the twenty-fifth of April, 1882,
the defendant, the Bell Silver and Copper Mining Company,
a corporation organized under the laws of Montana, was the
owner and in possession of the mining ground described in
the complaint, the other defendants named being at the time
upon the premises under contract with the company On
that day the defendant company executed and delivered to
the grantees therein designated an indenture reciting that it
was authorized by the laws of the Territory of Montana, by
its articles of incorporation, and by a vote of its trustees, to
execute trust mortgages of all its property, real, personal, and
mixed, to secure the payment of bonds issued by it, and it was
about to issue sixty bonds in the sum of one thousand
dollars each to secure a loan of sixty thousand dollars to be
made to it, and declared that in order to secure the payment
of the bonds to be thus issued, and interest thereon, it had
granted, bargained, sold, and conveyed, and by those presents
did grant, bargain, sell, and convey, to Samuel Wells and
Theodore H. Tyndale, as trustees, and the survivor of them,
their successors in trust and assigns, the property described
in the complaint, with all the buildings, privileges, franchises,
and appurtenances- this last clause not to be construed so as
to prevent the company from selling old materials in the
ordinary course of business, to be replaced by new, nor to
prevent it from mining, reducing, or selling ore from the mine
in the ordinary course of business, meaning and intending
thereby to mortgage all the property, real, personal, and
mixed, of whatever nature or name, owned by the party of
the first part, but upon the following express trusts, that is to
say, that in case the Bell Silver and Copper Mining Company
should fail to pay the principal or any part thereof which
might fall due on the bonds secured thereby, at any time and
place when and where the same might become due and payable
according to the tenor and effect thereof and for thirty days
thereafter, then and in that case, upon the written request of
the holders of one-fourth part of the bonds which might at

the time be outstanding and unpaid, it should be the duty of
the parties of the second part, their survivors or assigns, to
enter upon and take possession of the premises of the party
of the first part, their successors in trust and assigns, or they
might at their discretion, upon the written request of the
holders of one-fourth of the bonds then unpaid, cause the
premises and property to be sold at public auction in Butte
City, Montana, or in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, as the
parties of the second part, their successors or assigns, might
deem best, first giving thirty days' notice of the time and
place and terms of sale by publishing the same once a week
for three weeks successively in one of the principal newspapers
for the time being in Boston, Massachusetts, and Butte City,
Montana, and upon such sale to execute to the purchaser or
purchasers thereof a good and sufficient deed or deeds of conveyance in fee simple for the same which should be a bar
against the said Bell Silver and Copper Iining Company,
party of the first part, its successors and assigns, and all other
persons claiming under it or them, of all right, interest, or
claim in and to the premises and property and all parts
thereof.
And it was expressly agreed by the indenture in question
that the parties of the second part, their successors and assigns, or any persons in their behalf, might purchase at any
sale thus made or made by order of the court, under the laws
of Montana, and that no other person should be answerable
for the application of the purchase money, and that the trustees should, after deducting from the proceeds of such sale
the costs and expenses thereof, and of managing the property,
and enough to indemnify and save themselves harmless from
and against all liability arising from the trust and for their
own compensation, apply so much of the proceeds of the
premises and property as might be necessary for the payment
of the principal and interest of the bonds unpaid, whether
matured or not, and restore the residue to the party of the
first part, it being expressly understood and agreed that in no
case should any claim or advantage be taken of any valuation
or appraisement, redemption or extension, by the party of the

Opinion of the Court.

first part, its successors or assigns, nor any process be obtained
or applied for by it or them to prevent such entry or sale and
-conveyance.
The agreed statement of facts further showed, aside from
.other things, that thereafter, on the twenty-fourth day of
June, 1885, one Harriet IM.Pitman, being then the owner of
thirty-five of the bonds mentioned therein, which had been
,due more than thirty days, wrote to Wells and Tyndale a letter directing them in their discretion to proceed and sell the
premises upon the terms described in the instrument, and
thereafter, on the fourteenth day of July, 1885, the bonds being past due and unpaid, Samuel Wells and Theodore H. Tyndale prepared and published a notice of sale, the substance of
which, as to time, was published in the Boston Traveller and
the Butte :Miner, papers of general circulation in the cities
and vicinities respectively where they were published.
And in pursuance of such notice on September 2, 1885,
Wells and Tyndale offered for sale to the highest bidder the
property described in the notice, when the same was struck
off to the holders of the bonds in the mortgages mentioned
for the sum of f6rty-five thousand dollars, they being then
and there the highest and best bidders, and thereafter on the
twelfth of October, 1885, Wells and Tyndale made and delivered to the plaintiffs, the purchasers at the sale, a deed of
the premises described.
This deed is the source of the title of the plaintiff and the
ground upon which their present action rests for recovery
When the case was pending in the Supreme Court of the
Territory it was objected that the deed was void upon several
grounds, one, that the notice of sale was not in conformity
with the requirements of the contract, second, that the description of the property was insufficient in law, and, third,
that the power and authority under which the mortgagees and
trustees executed the deed was void under section 371 of the
Revised Statutes of Montana. These several objections were
coisidered at length by the Supreme Court of the Territory
and held to be untenable.
By the first objection was meant, though not happily ex-

pressed, that the notice of sale was not sufficient in the length
of time for which it was given. The instrument provides for
"thirty days' notice of the time and place and terms of such
sale, by publishing the same once a week for three weeks successively, in one of the principal newspapers for the time being in Boston, MHassachusetts, and Butte City, Montana." The
notice of sale, in fact, was published on the 15th, 22d, and 29th
of July, 1885, in the Boston Traveller, and in the Butte Daily
Miner on the 21st of July, and each succeeding day, including
the 11th of August, 1885, and the sale took place on the 2d
day of the following September. Between the 15th of July,
the date of the first publication in the Boston Traveller, and
the 2d of September more than thirty days elapsed, and between the 21st of July, the date of the first publication in the
Butte Daily Miner, and the 2d day of September was also
more than thirty days, and the publication in each paper was
once a week for three weeks successively It is contended
that unless the last notice in each of the papers preceded the
sale by thirty days it was insufficient. This position was held
untenable by the Supreme Court of the Territory, and, we
think, correctly It is sufficient that the notice of sale was.

notice preceded the sale thirty days. The first publication

as much as the second or last.
eLqyler v Ar'mstrong, 4 Iowa,
482, 485. The second objection is sufficiently answered by
the fact that the description in the notice of sale is a transcript of that contained in the mortgage, and if it is defective
in any respect in the description of the personalty it is sufficient that it is complete in the description of the real property, for the recovery of which the action is brought. The
third objection was that the power under which the trustees
executed the deed was void under section 371 of the Revised
Statutes of Montana. This objection requires further consideration. The statute declares that a mortgage of real
property shall not be deemed a conveyance, whatever its
terms, so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover
possession of the real property without a foreclosure and sale.

BELL MINING CO. v. BUTTE BANK.
Opinion of the Court.

It was taken from a similar statute in the laws of California.

It constitutes section 260 of its practice act and has frequently
been the subject of construction by its courts.
In Kock v B zggs, 14 California, 256, which was a case in
which Briggs was indebted to Koch on a promissory note and
to secure its payment executed to one Swift, as trustee, a deed
of a parcel of real property containing a provision for its sale
upon default in the payment of the note and interest, or any
part thereof, and that upon application of the holder he should
sell the premises at public auction at a designated place in the
county to the highest bidder for cash, after fifteen days' previous publication of notice in one of the newspapers of the
county of the time and place of sale, and execute to the purchaser a good and sufficient deed of the same, and out of the
proceeds, after satisfying the expenses of the advertisement
and sale and of the trust generally, pay the principal and interest due upon the note, and render the surplus, if any, to the
grantor, or his representatives, and the court held the instrument to be a deed of trust and distinguishable in some features
from a mortgage, though executed as security for the debt of
the grantor. By the common law a mortgage was a conveyance of a conditional estate, which became absolute upon
breach of its condition. The instrument being intended as
security for a debt, it became operative as a conveyance if the
condition

-

that is, the payment of the debt - was not com-

plied with.
A court of equity, however, considering that the itistrument
was intended principally as security, gave to the mortgagor a
right to redeem the premises from forfeiture, after a breach
of its conditions, that is, after the grantor's failure to pay the
debt secured, which constituted the mortgagor's equity of
redemption. Many attempts were made at different times by
special provisions to lessen and deprive the mortgagor of this
right and to treat the instrument as an absolute conveyance.
The object of the provision of the three hundred and
seventy-first section of the statute of Montana and of the
similar law of California, from which it was taken, was to
preclude any arrangement between the mortgagor and the

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

mortgagee by which the former's right to the property could
be cut off without a sale of the same. It therefore held that
the mortgage should not operate as a conveyance, whatever
its terms, until a foreclosure and sale. The foreclosure might
be by judicial proceedings in equity or by any other regular
proceedings which resulted in extinguishing the mortgagor's
right of property by sale.
In deciding .Koch v Brzggs, (p. 262,) and iu distinguishing
it from a mortgage in its strict form, the court said "Where
there is a mortgage there is a right, after condition broken,
to a foreclosure on the part of the mortgagee, and a right of
a redemption on the part of the mortgagor. It matters not
whether we consider the instrument a conveyance of a conditional estate in the land, as at common law, or as creating a
mere lien or encumbrance for the purpose of security, as by
our law The right to foreclose, whether resulting in vesting
an absolute title to the property in the mortgagee, as formerly
in England, or in a judicial sale of the premises, as in this
State, exists in all cases of mortgage, after breach of condition,
as does also the right to redeem the property from forfeiture,
or from the encumbrance of the lien. These two rights are
mutual and reciprocal."
In the case of Fogarty v Sawyer, 17 California, 589, 592,
the instrument under which the property conveyed was
intended as security and to be sold by the trustees named
upon breach of its condition for payment. It was similar in
form to the indenture under consideration in this case, and the
court said
"Under the section" (260 of the Practice Act of California
referred to) "the mortgage creates a mere lien for the pur
poses of security, and, as in other cases of lien upon real property, can only be enforced by judicial proceedings, except by
the authority of the owner of the property By virtue of the
mortgage alone the mortgagee can neither acquire the possession nor dispose of the premises, but the existence of the
mortgage does not prevent the owner from making an independent contract for the possession, or from authorizing a sale
of the premises, the mortgagee consenting thereto, to pay off

Opinion of the Court.

the debt. Nor is it perceived that there is any legal obstacle
to making such contract with the mortgagee or to clothing
him with the power of sale. If the owner of the property
sees fit to enter into such an arrangement with him, or to confer such power upon him, it would be going a great way for
the court, for that reason alone, to invalidate the proceedings.
The right to dispose both of the possession and estate follows
necessarily from the ownership of the property, and, this being
so, no valid objection can be urged against incorporating the
contract and power in the same instrument with the mortgage. They do not become in that way any part of the
mortgage, but are as much independent of it as though contained in separate instruments. Some stress is placed by the
respondent upon the use of the words ' whatever its terms' in
the statute. This language is supposed to prohibit separate
stipulations between the parties for the possession and for the
sale of the premises upon default. We do not thus construe
the language, but, on the contrary, are clear that it was only
intended to control the terms of grant, bargain, and sale.
generally employed in mortgages."
We agree to what is stated by the court in that case.
There is nothing in the law of mortgages, nor in the law that
covers what are sometimes designated as trust deeds in the
nature of mortgages, which prevents the conferring by the
grantor or mortgagor in such instrument of the power to sell
the premises described therein upon default in payment of
the debt secured by it, and if the sale is conducted in accordance with the terms of the power, the title to the premises
granted by way of security passes to the purchaser upon its
consummation by a conveyance. Grant v Burr, 54 California, 298, Bateman v Burr, 57 California, 480.
The power of sale in the indenture, whether we call it a
deed of trust or a mortgage, does not change its character
as an instrument for the security of the indebtedness designated, but it is an additional authority to the grantee or
mortgagee, and if he does not choose to foreclose the mortgage by any of the ordinary methods provided by law, h&
can proceed under the power added for the sale of the prop-

erty, to obtain payment of the indebtedness. The insertion
of a power of sale does not affect the mortgagor's right to
redeem so long as the power remains unexecuted and the
mortgage is not, as it may be, foreclosed in the ordinary manner, but when a sale is made of the interest of the mortgagor, his right is wholly divested, embracing his equity of
redemption.
Mr. Jones, in his careful treatise on Mortgages, observes
that "the delay and expense incident to a foreclosure and
sale in equity have brought power of sale mortgages and
trust deeds into general favor both in England and America,
and although their general use is now confined to a part only
of our States, the same influences which have already led to
their partial adoption and use are likely to lead to their general use everywhere at an early day
A power of
sale, whether vested in the creditor himself or in a trustee,
affords a prompt and effectual security"
The sale made by the trustees in the case under consideration complied in all essential particulars with the conditions contained in the deed of trust or mortgage, whichever
it may be called, and the deed executed by the trustees passed
to the purchasers a good title to the premises covered by the
indenture.
