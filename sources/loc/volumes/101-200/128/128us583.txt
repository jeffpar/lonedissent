Opinion of the Court.

the harbor in which the people of a city or county can find a
refuge from ill-advised, unequal, and oppressive State legislation."
As the question raised in these cases is a Federal question
(Spencer v. Mochant, supfra), we will not sustain the motions
to dismiss; but as there was, in our judgment, color for those
motions, and the contention now made has often been pressed
upon our attention before, and as often determined adversely,
so that the rule must be regarded as settled, we shall grant
the motions to affirm.

MEANS v. DOWD.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT

COURT

OF

THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH- CAROLINA.
No. 47.

Submitted and decided December 17, 1888.

The court denies a motion for an order for a mandate, no notice of it having been given to the other party.

IT has been the custom with the court to make a general
order, immediately before the commencement of the February
recess, for the issue of mandates in every case disposed of prior
to the 1st of January, if application therefor should be made,
except in cases in which a petition for rehearing might be
pending, and cases docketed and dismissed under the 9th
rule. In this case, which is reported ante, page 273, application was made to the court for the immediate issue of a mandate, without giving the other party notice of the intention
to make such a motion.

Mr'. TF. IF. Fleming for the motion.
No one opposing.
PER Cuniu
: No notice having been given to the other side,
and there being no agreement of the parties that the mandate
may issue, the motion is
Denied.
