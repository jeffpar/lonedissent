THE CHIEF JUSTICE:

This was an action brought against

certain subscribers to a contract to recover damages for its
breach. Defendants demurred upon the grounds that the
court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action,
and that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them. The demurrers were
sustained and judgment rendered in favor of defendants on
June 28, 1892. The writ of error from this court was sued

dismissed upon the authority of Iaynarcd v. IHeeh, 151 U. S.

Where the trial judge is satisfied upon the evidence that the plaintiff is not
entitled to recover, and that a verdict, if rendered for plaintiff, must be
set aside, the court may instruct the jury to find for the defendant, and
in such case no constitutional question arises; but if the court errs as
matter of law in so doing, the remedy lies in a review in the appropriate
court.

Tim CHIEF JUSTICE: This was an action of trespass on the
case. At the conclusion of the trial defendants moved the
court to charge the jury to find the issues for defendants,
which motion was granted, and the jury was directed, upon
the whole case, to return a verdict for defendants, plaintiff
duly excepting. Thereupon the jury returned a verdict accordingly; plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was denied,
