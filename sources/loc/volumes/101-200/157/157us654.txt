OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

for public purposes, under the authority of the State whose
instrumentality it is, is a burden upon the exercise of the
powers of that corporation'which only the State creating it
may impose. In such a case it is immaterial to inquire
whether the tax is, in its nature or by its operation, a direct
or an indirect tax; for the instrumentalities of the Statesamong which, as is well settled, are municipal corporations,
exercising powers and holding property for the benefit of the
public- are not subjects of national taxation, in any form or
for any purpose, while the property of private corporations
and of individuals is subject to taxation by the general government for national purposes. So it has been frequently adjudged, and the question is no longer an open one in this
court.
Upon the several questions about which the members of this
court are equally divided in opinion, I deem it appropriate to
withhold any expression of my views, because the opinion of
the Chief Justice is silent in regard to those questions.
