Opinion of the Court.

levine, 98 U. S. 450, is not in point. There the charge was
of wrongfully withholding pension money, and it was in refer"In short, there
ence to such charge that the court said
must be such unreasonable delay, some refusal to pay on
demand, or some such intent to keep the money wrongfully
from the pensioner, as would constitute an unlawful withholding in the meaning of the law."
The charge of wrongfully withholding implies the possibility, at least, of a rightful receipt, and the offence consists
in failing to turn over to the proper party that which has
been thus received. But the charge here is of demanding,
receiving, and retaining. It implies that there was wrong in
the original exaction, and it is unnecessary to aver a demand
upon the defendant to undo such' wrong. If he wrongfully
demanded and received and still retains the sum so demanded
and received, the offence is complete.
So far as respects the objection that the count does not conclude that the offence charged was "contrary to the form of
the statutes in such case made and provided, and against the
peace and dignity of the United States," it is sufficient to say
that such allegation, which is one of a mere conclusion of law,
is not of the substance of the charge, and the omission is of a
matter of form, which does not tend to the prejudice of the
defendant, and is, therefore, within the rule of section 1025
Rev. Stat., to be disregarded.
These are the only matters of objection to this indictment.
No one of them is tenable, and, therefore, the judgment is
-Affirmed.

granted solely upon the question of jurisdiction" and made further pro-

visions for determining what parts of the record should be certified to
this court under the appeal, under which it subsequently directed the
portions of the record to be certified to this court, and the record was
prepared accordingly. Held, that this was a sufficient certificate of a
question of jurisdiction under the provisions of the Judiciary Act of
March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827.

A Circuit Court of the United States has not the power to appoint a receiver
of property already in the possession of a receiver duly and previously
appointed by a state court, and cannot rightfully take the property out
of the hands of the receiver so appointed by the state court.
The mere forcible continuance of possession wrongfully acquired by the
Federal court does not transform that which was in the first instance
wrongful, into a rightful possession.

Tn facts in this case are as follows: On June 6, 1892, in a
suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of Tennessee, brought by John Coleman against the
.Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company and Allison, Shafer & Company, an order was entered appointing Frank
J. Hoyle receiver of all the property of the railroad company.
The bill upon which this order was made alleged that in 1890
the defendant railroad company had contracted with its codefendants, Allison, Shafer & Company, for the construction
of its line of railroad from Morristown to Corryton, a distance
of about forty miles, which work was partially completed in
February or March, 1892; that there was yet due from the
railroad company to Allison, Shafer & Company more than
$50,000; that Allison, Shafer & Company were indebted to
the complainant for work and labor done in the construction
of such railroad; that notice, claiming a lien, had been duly
given the railroad company, and that it was insolvent, as were
also Allison, Shafer & Company. The prayer was for judgment against Allison, Shafer & Company, that the amount
thereof be declared a lien upon the railroad property, and for
the appointment of a receiver pending the suit.
In pursuance of this order the receiver took possession of the
railroad. On June 8, 1892, the railroad company appeared
and filed a petition for leave to execute a bond for whatever
sum might be decreed in favor of the complainant and that
the order appointing the receiver be vacated. This petition
was sustained, the bond given and approved, and an order

170

entered discharging the receiver. Thereupon the receiver
turned the property over to the railroad company, receiving
the receipt of its general manager therefor.
On June 20, 1892, T. H. 2Mcioy, Jr., filed his petition in
the same case setting up a claim against the railroad company
for services rendered as an employ6 and vice-president of the
railroad company, and for expenses incurred on its behalf. On
July 4 and July 7, 1892, other petitions were filed setting up
further claims against the railroad company.
On July 27, 1892, each of the defendants filed a separate
answer to the complainant's bill. No further order was made
by the Circuit Court until November 12, 1892, when, as the
record shows, a.demurrer of the railroad company to the petitions filed on July 4 and July 7 was argued and overruled,
and leave given to answer on or before December rules. The
record of proceedings on that day contains this further recital:
"On motion of complainant, and it appearing that the bill
in this cause is properly filed as a general creditor's bill to
wind up the affairs of an insolvent corporation, it is ordered by
the court that the bill be sustained as such, and that all creditors of said Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company and all other persons interested therein come forward
and exhibit their demands and have themselves made parties
to this bill on or before the 2d Monday of January next and
show in their petitions the nature and extent of their claims
and whether they have security or lien therefor; and, if so,
the nature thereof and the property upon which their liens
rest. But parties having suits now pending in other courts
against said Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company for rights of way or other claims or demands may prosecute the same to judgment and file their judgments in this
court as evidence of the amount and character of their
demands. And the clerk of this court will make publication,
notifying all creditors of said Mforristown and Cumberland
Gap Railroad Company of the contents of this order, which
publication will be inserted at least twice a week for the
next four weeks in the Knoxville Daily Tribune. And thereupon complainant moved the court for the restoration of the

receivership in this case and the appointment of a receiver to
take possession and custody of all the property of said Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company, and W. S.
Whitney is appointed temporary receiver of the railroad and
its property, and ordered to take custody and control of said
railroad, its operations, and all other property of said railroad
company."
On November 29, 1892, an amended and supplemental bill
was filed, naming as complainants not merely the original
complainant John Coleman, but also the various subsequent
intervening petitioners. It is enough to say of this amended
and supplemental bill that it stated facts sufficient to justify
the appointment of a receiver.
On October 28, 1892, a bill was prepared addressed "to the
Honorable John P. Smith, chancellor, etc., presiding in the
chancery court at Morristown, Tennessee." This bill was in
the name of sundry creditors of the railroad company against
it, and other parties, setting forth certain judgments in favor
of the complainants against the railroad company; its insolvency as well as that of the firm of Allison, Shafer & Company;
the existence of a multitude of unpaid claims, and prayed the
appointment of a receiver. This bill having been presented
to the Honorable Joseph W. Sneed, one of the judges of the
State of Tennessee, he signed the following fiat, as it is called
in the practice of that State:
" STTE

"Upon the presentation of the foregoing bill and on consideration of its averments it is ordered:

by the clerk, conditional, as in ordinary injunction cases, in
the penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
"2. That the prayer for a temporary receiver of the Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company be granted,
and James T. Shields, Jr., is hereby appointed such temporary
receiver, and he shall, before entering upon the discharge of

his duties, file with the clerk and master a good and sufficient
bond, to be approved by the master, in the penalty of twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000.00).
"3. Immediately after his qualification said receiver is
directed to take possession of said railroad and all other property belonging thereto or in possession of said company by
lease or otherwise, and shall accurately inventory same and
file a copy of said inventory with the master. Said receiver
is directed to operate said road and to take charge of its tolls
and incomes and to continue and preserve the same in like
condition as at present, if practicable; and to that end he is
directed to employ or continue the employment, as justice
may demand, all necessary agents and employ~s whose services are essential to the continued operation of the road or
the preservation of its property; and to that end he is authorized to contract, in his official capacity as receiver, for the
payment of such reasonable sums as may be necessary to
defray the expenses of such services.
"4. It is further ordered that a copy of this order be served
upon the defendant, the A. & C. G. R. R. Company, along

said division, on the second Thursday, being the 10th day of
November, 1892, at 10 o'clock A.M., at chambers, at the courthouse, in Rutledge, Tenn., and then and there show any
reason which may be made to appear to the court why a
permanent receiver shall not be appointed of said railroad
company in this cause, and why the temporary restraining
order granted herein shall not be made permanent.
"5. In the event that it shall become necessary to issue a
writ of possession to put said receiver in the quiet and peaceable possession of all the property of said corporation, it is
ordered that the master issue writs of possession, directed to
the sheriffs of iamblen, Grainger, and Knox Counties, for
that purpose, commanding said sheriffs to place said receiver
in the possession of that portion of said company's property
which may be in their several counties.

SHIELDS v. COLEMAN.
Statement of the Case.

This fiat was on the same day filed in the office of the clerk
of the chancery court, and the receiver therein named, immediately took possession of the railroad property and commenced the operation of the road. His possession continued
until November 14, 1892, when the receiver appointed by the
Circuit Court of the United States took the property out of
his hands.
Notice was thereafter given that on January 7, 1893, an
application would be made to the chancellor for the appointment of a permanent receiver, and on that day this order was
entered by the chancellor:

"And it appearing to the court that on October 28, 1892,

by said court in said cause the property of the said railway
company was taken from the possession of the receiver of this
court and placed in the possession of the receiver of that
court; and the court, being of the opinion that to appoint a
permanent receiver in advance of a determination of the
question of superior jurisdiction would be unseemly and not
in conformity with that spirit of comity which exists between
the state and Federal courts of concurrent jurisdiction, doth
order that said motion for a permanent receiver be entered
and continued, with leave to call the same up upon notice at
any time after said question of jurisdiction is settled.
"It is further ordered that James T. Shields, Jr., the temporary receiver of said corporation and its property under the

On January 21, 1893, the receiver J. T. Shields, Jr., in
obedience to the direction of the chancellor, filed his motion
in the Circuit Court of the United States, setting forth the
facts herein stated, and praying that court to vacate its order
appointing W. S. Whitney receiver of the road, and for an
order restoring the possession to him. This motion was on
January 30, 1893, overruled, and exception duly taken. Subsequent proceedings were had in the Circuit Court culminating
on January 31, 1894, in a final decree, which decree established
certain liens, and ordered the property to be sold.
Thereafter an appeal to this court was prayed for and
allowed in behalf of the receiver appointed by the state court,

the petition and the order allowing the appeal being in these
words:
"Your petitioner, James T. Shields, Jr., suing as receiver
of the Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company,
respectfully represents that there is manifest error committed,
to the injury of the petitioner, by the final decree pronounced
in this cause on the 31st day of January, 1894, and by the interlocutory orders and decrees theretofore pronounced in these
-,
in and by which said interlocutory orders and final decrees this court assumed and asserted jurisdiction of the property and effects belonging and constituting the estate of the
defendant Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company
as against the lawful custody and possession of this petitioner
under orders and decrees theretofore pronounced by the chancery court of Hlamblen County, Tennessee, in the cause pending
in said chancery court entitled ' Thomas B. Crosby et al. v.
.Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company et al.,'
under jurisdiction theretofore lawfully exercised and assumed,
said chancery court being a court of equity of concurrent jurisdiction with this court, and which said chancery court of
Hamblen County, Tennessee, was thereby ousted of the lawful
jurisdiction, and this petitioner, as such receiver, became deprived of the lawful custody of the property and estate of
said Morristown and Cumberland Gap Railroad Company, the
subject-matter of controversy in the cause then and there
pending in said court.
"Wherefore petitioner, James T. Shields, Jr., receiver, etc.,
considering himself aggrieved, prays an order granting an
appeal from said final decree and interlocutory orders, taking

of the United States, as authorized by section 5 of the act

Mr.IIenry fl. Ingersoll for appellees.
MNI.JusTioE BnBER, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The single question presented by this appeal is that of the
jurisdiction of the Federal court to appoint a receiver, and take
the railroad property out of the possession of the receiver
appointed by the state court. In such cases, as was held in
Milaynard v. Hecht, 151 U. S.321, it is essential that the question of jurisdiction alone should be certified to this court from
the trial court. But under the authority of United States v.
,fahn, 155 U S.109, and In re Zehigh Company, 156 U. S.322,
the statement in the last order quoted from the record taken
in connection with the petition upon which it was founded
must be held to be a sufficient certificate. It is not necessary
that the word "certify" be formally used. It is sufficient if

SHIELDS v. COLEMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

there is a plain declaration that the single matter which is by
the record sent up to this court for decision is a question of
jurisdiction, and the precise question clearly, fully, and separately stated. No mere suggestion that the jurisdiction of the
court was in issue will answer. This court will not of itself
search, nor follow counsel in their search of the record to
ascertain whether the judgment of the trial court did or did
not turn on some question of jurisdiction. But the record
must affirmatively show that the trial court sends up for consideration a single definite question of jurisdiction. And that is
here shown. The petition for an appeal is upon the single
ground that the court wrongfully took jurisdiction of the property, because it was then in the possession of the state court,
and in the order allowing the appeal it is explicitly stated that
"this appeal is granted solely upon the question of jurisdiction," and the court at the same time reserved to itself the right,
which it subsequently exercised, of determining what portions
of the proceedings should be incorporated into the record sent
here for the purpose of presenting this question.
Had the Circuit Court of the United States, when this
property was in the possession of the receiver appointed by
the state court, the power to appoint another receiver and
take the property out of the former's hands? We are of
opinion that it had not. For the purposes of this case it is
unnecessary to decide whether, as between courts of concurrent jurisdiction, when proceedings are commenced in the
one court with the view of the appointment of a receiver,
they may be continued to the completion of actual possession,
and whether, while those proceedings are pending in a due
and orderly way, the other court can, in a suit subsequently
commenced, by reason of its speedier modes of procedure,
seize the property, and thus prevent the court in which the
proceedings were first commenced from asserting its right to
the possession. Gaylord v. Fort Wayne &c. Railroad, 6
Bissell, 286-291, cited in .- oran v. Stu'ges, 154 U. S. 256-270;
High on Receivers, 3d ed. sec. 50. Of course, the question
can fairly arise only in a case in which process has been served,
and in which the express object of the bill, or at least one express
VOL. CLVI-12

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

object, is the appointment of a receiver, and where possession
by such officer is necessary for the full accomplishment of the
other purposes named therein. The mere fact that, in the
progress of an attachment or other like action, an exigency
may arise, which calls for the appointment of a receiver, does
not make the jurisdiction of the court, in that respect, relate
back to the commencement of the action.
In IJeidritterv. Elizabeth Oil-Cloth Co., 112 U. S. 294, 301,
a question was presented as to the time that jurisdiction
attaches. ~r. Justice Matthews, after quoting from Coo er v.
Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, and Boswell's Lessee v. Otis, 9 How.
336, observed: "But the land might be bound, without actual
service of process upon the owner, in cases where the only
object of the proceedings was to enforce a claim against it
specifically, of a nature to bind the title. In such cases the
land itself must be drawn within the jurisdiction of the court
by some assertion of its control and power over it. This, as
we have seen, is ordinarily done by actual seizure, but may
be done by the mere bringing of the suit in which the claim
is sought to be enforced, which may, by law, be equivalent to
a seizure, being the open and public exercise of dominion over
it for the purposes of the suit."
Undoubtedly the Circuit Court had authority under the bill
filed June 6, 1892, to make the order appointing the receiver
and taking possession of the property. Even if it were conceded that the bill was imperfect and that amendments were
necessary to make it a bill complete in all respects, it would not
follow that the court was without jurisdiction. The purpose
of the bill - the relief sought -was, among other things, the
possession of the property by a receiver to be appointed by
the court, and when the court adjudged the bill sufficient, and
made the appointment, that appointment could not be questioned by another court, or the possession of the receiver thus
appointed disturbed. The bill was clearly sufficient to uphold
the action then taken.
While the validity of the appointment made by the Circuit Court on June 6, 1892, cannot be doubted, yet, when
that court thereafter accepted a bond in lieu of the property,

SHIELDS v. COLEMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

discharged the receiver, and ordered him to turn over the
property to the railroad, and such surrender was made in
obedience to this order, the property then became free for the
action of any other court of competent jurisdiction. It will
never do to hold that after a court, accepting security in lieu
of the property, has vacated the order which it has once made
appointing a receiver and turned the property back to the
original owner, the mere continuance of the suit operates to
prevent any other court from touching that property.
It is true that the Circuit Court had the power to thereafter
set aside its order accepting security in place of the property
and enter a new order for taking possession by a receiver,
yet such new order would not relate back to the original filing
of the bill so as to invalidate action taken by other courts in
the meantime. Accepting a bond and directing the receiver
to return the property to the owner was not simply the transfer of the possession from one officer of the court to another.
The bond which was given was not a bond to return the property if the judgment to be rendered against the contractors
was not paid, but a bond to pay whatever judgment should
be rendered. It was, therefore, in no sense of the term a
forthcoming bond. The property ceased to be in custodia
legis. It was subject to any rightful disposition by the owner
or to seizure under process of any court of competent jurisdiction.
The intervening petitions filed on June 20, July 4, and July
7 are not copied in the record, having been omitted therefrom
by direction of the Circuit Court. Evidently, therefore, there
was nothing in them which bears upon the question before us,
and doubtless they were simply intervening petitions, claiming
so much money of the railroad company and containing no
reference to the appointment of a receiver.
But it is said that the receiver has no such interest in the
property as will give him a standing in the Circuit Court to
petition for the restoration of the property to his possession,
or to maintain an appeal to this court from an order refusing
'to restore such. possession. This is a mistake. He was the
officer in possession by appointment of the state court, the

OCTOBER TERMvf, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

proper one to maintain possession and to take all proper steps
under the direction of the court to obtain the restoration
of the possession wrongfully taken from him. It is a matter
of every-day occurrence for a receiver to take legal proceedings, under the direction of the court appointing him, to acquire possession of property or for the collection of debts due
to the estate of which he is receiver.
With reference to the contention that all of the parties
plaintiffs in the suit in the state court have come into the
Federal court, so that in fact the receiver appointed by the
state court no longer represents any one-stat nominis
umbra -it
is sufficient to say that it is not borne out .by the
record. It is true that the plaintiffs in this case filed a petition in the Federal court in which it was alleged that all the
parties plaintiffs in the state court had appeared in the Federal court, and that all the claims of these parties except one
of Mellon & Sons, who had two claims, had been presented
and allowed, and that Mellon & Sons in their intervening
petition had set up one of their claims for allowance, and
averred that they were prosecuting the other to judgment in
the state court, and that they would, when judgment was
obtained thereon, also file that for allowance. But the record
shows that the order prayed for in this petition was denied by
the Circuit Court without any finding as to the truth of the
facts therein alleged. We cannot assume, therefore, as against
the application of the state receiver, that the allegations in
that petition are true. Further than that, the Circuit Court,
in directing what should be incorporated into the record to be
sent up on this appeal, directed that there should be inserted a
"memorandum of all petitions and pleadings filed, giving dates
of petitions without setting out same, down to the final decree,
except in cases where directed to be copied in full." In pursuance of that order the clerk incorporated in this record a
memorandum of the intervening petitions, and in that memorandum there is no mention of any petition on the part of any
of the plaintiffs in the state court except Aellon & Sons. It
thus affirmatively appears that up to the date of the final
decree only one of the several plaintiffs in the state court

SHIELDS v. COLETA-N.
Opinion of the Court.

had come into the Federal court. While it is true that in the
final decree there is an entry of allowances in favor of these
parties, yet there is nothing to show that these allowances
were made upon the application of such plaintiffs, or that the
amounts allowed to them were the amounts which they
claimed, unless this can be implied from the order therein
declaring a lien upon the allowances in favor of the counsel
of such parties for their services in obtaining the several
recoveries. Conceding all that may be inferred from this
order, or from anything else that appears in the record, it
remains beyond dispute that one claim of Mellon & Sons, for
$84,000, is still pending and undetermined in the suit in the
state court. But further, the question of right on the part of
the petitioner antedates the final decree, and he stands in the
Federal court backed by the order of the state court appointing him receiver, and directing him to press this application.
If it were true that all the plaintiffs in the state court had
abandoned their suit in that court, the remedy was to call the
attention of that court to the fact and have an order entered
setting aside the appointment of a receiver, or directing the
discontinuance of this application. We cannot, in this indirect
way, pass judgment upon the action of that court.
It is objected that Judge Sneed had no authority to make
the appointment of a receiver, and that the appointment was
not made by the chancery court, nor by the chancellor at
chambers, nor by any other chancellor or Circuit Court judge
of the State of Tennessee. The record does not disclose of
what court Judge Sneed was a judge. But we find in 91
Tenn. v, a list of the judges of that State in the year 1892,
and the courts of which they were judges. In that list is the
name of J. W. Sneed as judge of the Criminal Court of Knox
County. That court has, as appears from the statutes, exclusive criminal jurisdiction in that county. It also has common
law jurisdiction, and the practice and pleadings in all civil
actions are the same as prescribed for the Circuit Courts of
the State. It is held by one judge, who takes the same oath
of office as other judges. He is paid out of the state treasury, as they are paid, and has power to interchange with

Opinion of the Court.

them in official work. (Sees. 163, 164, 165, 166, Milliken and
Vertrees' Code of Tenn. 1884.)
In the same code sections 4714 and -1715 read as follows:
"4714. The judges and chancellors shall have interchangeable and concurrent jurisdiction to grant injunctions, attachments, and all other extraordinary process, issuable out of and
returnable to any of the circuit or chancery courts of this State.
"4715. Upon making the requisite fiats for, and granting
such extraordinary process, it shall be the duty of the judge
or chancellor to enclose the papers accompanying the application and the order made, in a sealed envelope, directed to the
clerk of the court to which the fiat is directed, which envelope
shall be opened only by the clerk or his deputy."
Obviously the action taken by Judge Sneed was under the
authority of these two sections, and they seem broad enough to
sustain it. No decision of the Supreme Court of the State has
been called to our attention bearing upon this question, or construing "judges" to mean only "Circuit Court judges." At
any rate, the validity of his action was recognized by the chancellor, who treated his fiat as one made by proper authority;
and as the chancery court had unquestioned jurisdiction over
all proceedings in equity, including bills for receivers, we must
assume that Judge Sneed's order was valid, and the appointment of a temporary receiver by him authorized by the laws
and practice of the State.
It is further objected that the proceedings in the Federal
court have moved on to a final decree by which various liens
have been determined, and that it would be a great hardship
to now declare the order appointing the receiver, and assuming
possession of this property, beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal court. It is a sufficient reply to this that all the parties
who sought to enforce their rights in the state court have not
come into the Federal court, and submitted their claims to its
jurisdiction.
Some are still pursuing their remedy in the
forum which they selected, and whatever of hardship there
may be, whatever of expense may result, must fall upon the
parties who have thus wrongfully secured the taking away of
the possession of this property from the custodian rightfully
