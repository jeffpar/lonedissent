JAMES v. APPEL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

ARIZONA.
No. 108. Argued December 17, 1903.-Decided January 4,1904.
A statute copied from a similar statute of another State is generally presumcd to be adopted with the construction which it already has received.
There is no unconstitutional assumption of judicial power, or anything
inconsistent with the grant of common law jurisdiction to the Courts of
the Territory, in the legislature of Arizona enacting that notions for
new trials are deemed to have been overruled if not acted upon by the
end of the term at which made, the question to be subject to review
by the Supreme Court as if the motion had been overruled by the court
and exceptions reserved.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

In Dominus Rex v. Ingram, 2 Salk. 594, it is held that the
failure of the magistrate to perform his duties within the time
required by law did not determine his authority to perform
them, and such has been the rule ever since. The following
cases from different States sufficiently show this to be the
case. People v. Cook, 14 Barb. (N. Y.) 259, 290; Gilleland v.
Schuyler, 9 Kansas, * 569, * 587; Shaw v. Orr, 30 Iowa, 355;

Bass v. Hays, 38 Texas, 128; Ruff v. Hand, 24 Pac. Rep. (Arizona) 257, are not controlling in this case.
Paragraph 842, Rev. Stat. Arizona does not of itself purport
to render a judgment denying the motion for a new trial at
the expiration of the term at which the motion is made.
The refusal or neglect of a court to act cannot be reviewed
on appeal. Green v. Shumway, 14 Pac. Rep. 863; Chambers
v. Astor, 1 Missouri, 191. Only judicial action can be reviewed
by writ of error or appeal. Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S.
697, 704.
It is only from judicial decisions that appellate power is
given to the Supreme Court. See, also, Sanborn v. United
States, 27 C. Cl. 485; Hicks v. Murphy, 1 Mississippi,

If the decision of the Supreme Court of Arizona be correct
as to the interpretation of the statutes of Arizona, the statutes
are void as an attempted usurpation by the Legislature of the
judicial functions. §§ 1846, 1864, 1865, 1866, 1868, 1908,

If the construction placed by the Supreme Court of Arizona
upon paragraphs 837 and 842 be correct, these statutes are
void, being in conflict with section 1866, U. S. Revised Statutes, the same being section 33 of the Organic Act of Arizona.
Ex parte Lathrop, 118 U. S. 113, 117.
The grant of common law and chancery jurisdiction to the
District Court certainly gives to that court power to hear and
determine motions for a new trial. The origin and history of
the practice of granting new trials is obscure, principally on
account of its antiquity. Bouvier's Law Dict. New Trial;
Blackstone, Book III, 387; Graham & Waterman on New
Trials; Queen v. Bewaley, 1 P. Wms. 207, 213; Witham v. Earl

The right of a party to move for a new trial and the power

at common law prior to the American Revolution. When
common law jurisdiction was granted by the organic act to
the District Court of the Territories, this grant carried with it
the power to hear and determine motions for new trials as that
was a well recognized power of common law courts at the time
of the grant of such power. Mr. Frank H. Hereford, Mr. Seth E. Hazzard, Mr. C. W.
Holcomb, Mr. W. C. Keegin, Mr. J. H. McGowan for appellee,
submitted:
Paragraph 837, Rev. Stat. Arizona, 1887, is mandatory and
not directory. Cases on appellant's brief distinguished. A
court may adopt rules to govern its procedure with discretioAiary power to deviate from them where their application would
be injurious or impracticable. Grayson v. Virginia, 3 Dall.

Pr. 1241; Hudson v. Parker, 156 U. S. 277; Giant Powder Co.
v. Cal. V. P. Co., 6 Sawyer, 508.
The rule that a motion for a new trial may be continued to
succeeding terms like other motions or proceedings, is subject
to the proviso unless the statute requires said motion to be
heard during the trial term. Vallentine v. Holland, 40 Arkansas, 338; Walker v. Jefferson, 5 Arkansas, 23; Doddridge v.
Gaines, 1 MacArthur, D. C., 335; England v. Duckworth, 74
N. Car. 309; Kane v. Burrus, 2 Smed. & M. 313, which
distinguishes cases cited on appellant's brief. See also Gross
v. McClaran, 8 Texas, 341; Bullock v. Ballew, 9 Texas, 498;

Wilcox v. State, 31 Texas, 587; Carter v. Commissioners, 12
S. W. Rep. 985.
The object of construction and interpretation is to ascertain
the intent of the legislature, and there can be no doubt that,
by section 837, the Arizona legislature meant what the Texas
courts had held for thirty-five years to be the meaning of the
language adopted. In adopting and enacting a foreign statute
decisions expounding it are adopted with it. Tucker v. Oxley,

Neither paragraph 837 nor 842 as amended is open to objection that the legislature in enacting them exercised judicial
powers. Young v. State Bank, 4 Indiana, 301; 6 Am. & Eng.

is void § 837 stands and justifies dismissal and this court will
not determine whether the amendment is void or not. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 46.

MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
the Territory of Arizona dismissing an appeal because taken
too late. The appellees recovered a sum from the appellant in
the court of first instance, and after judgment was entered the
appellant moved for a new trial. The judge who tried the case,
being unable to attend, made an order in chambers continuing
the motion to another term. At a later term, after several
similar continuances, the motion was overruled, and the appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of the Territory.
These events took place before the passage of the Arizona
Revised Statutes of 1901. (See par. 1479.) It is assumed
that the appeal was too late if the judgment became final at

JANES v. APPEL.
192 U. S.

. Opinion of the Court.

the term when it was rendered, Revised Statutes of Arizona,
1887, par. 849, and we may assume further that the ground of
dismissal was the paragraph of the Revised Statutes, requiring that motions for new trials "shall be determined at the
term of the court at which the motion shall be made," R. S.
1887, par. 837, and the further provision of par. 842. By the
latter, as amended in 1891, "when upon motion a new trial is
denied," a review by the Supreme Court is provided for, and
it then is enacted that "in case there shall be no ruling on said
motion for a new trial during the term at which it was filed
then said motion shall be denied and the questions that may
have been raised thereby shall be subject to review by the
Supreme Court as if said motion had been overruled and exceptions thereto reserved and entered on the minutes of the
court." Acts of 1891, No. 49, p. 69.
The Arizona par. 837 is copied from a similar section in the
Texas code. Act of May 13, 1846, § 112, Hartley's Dig. Tex.
Code, Art. 766, 1 Sayles, Texas Civil Stats. Art. 1374 [1372].
Long before its adoption in Arizona the latter section had been
construed in Texas as mandatory and as discharging a motion
by operation of law if not acted upon at the same term. It
was held to put it out of the p6wer of the court to postpone the
motion for a new trial to the next term and then to act upon
it. If the requirement could be avoided by a continuance it
would be made almost nugatory. McKean v. Ziller, 9 Texas,
58; Bullock v. Ballew, 9 Texas, 498; Bass v. Hays, 38 Texas,
128. When a statute is taken in this way from another, even
a foreign, State, it generally is presumed to be adopted with
the construction which it has received. Tucker v. Oxley, 5
Cranch, 34, 42; Henrietta Mining and Milling Co. v. Gardner,
173 U. S. 123, 130; Commonwealth v. Hartnett, 3 Gray, 450.
See Coulam v. Doull, 133 U. S. 216. On this ground as well
as that of the meaning of the words, the act had been construed as in Texas by the Supreme Court of Arizona. Ruff
v. Hand, 24 Pac. Rep. 257. In view of the history of the section we shall spend no more time upon the question. Even

were it more doubtful, we are of opinion that the amendment
of 1891 to par. 842 makes the meaning plain. The words
"then [necessarily after the end of the term] said motion shall
be denied," show that the motion is disposed of at the end of
the term. Furthermore they do not mean that an order must
be made out of term because of the failure to make an order
within it, but mean that the motion shall be barred by the
lapse of time, adopting the decision of the year before in Ruff
v. Hand, and save an exception as if the motion had been
denied by the court. The amendment assumes or enacts that
the motion is to be deemed overruled at the end of the term,
and has for its object to give the party an exception in case he
appeals from the judgment, so that the propriety of granting
the motion may be reviewed along with the other matters
brought before the Supreme Court. See Spicer v. Simms, 57
Pac. Rep. 610.
It is urged that at least the statute cannot be meant to operate when the postponement is for the convenience of the court,
and the case is likened to those where a judgment or order is
entered nunc pro tunc in order to prevent a loss of rights through
a delay caused by the court itself. But there is no need of an
exception in such a case. The party's rights are saved but
transferred for consideration to a higher court, and were it
otherwise we should hesitate to read the exception into such
absolute words.
It is said that by the foregoing construction the legislature
attempts an unconstitutional assumption of judicial functions.
But this is a mistake, both in form and substance. In form
because the legislature does not direct a judgment but merely
removes an obstacle to a judgment already entered. (We need
not consider whether a different construction would be adopted
if the statute dealt with the time for entering judgments.) In
substance, because we no more can doubt the power of the
legislature to enact a statute of limitations for motions for a
new trial than we can doubt its power to enact such a statute
for the bringing of an action. It may be questioned whether

JAMES v. APPEL.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

there would be any constitutional objection to a law making
the original judgment final and doing away with new trials
altogether. "Rehearings, new trials are not essential to due
process of law, either in judicial or administrative proceedings."
Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. v. Backus, 154
U. S. 421, 426. See Montana Co. v. St. Louis Mining & Milling Co., 152 U. S. 160, 171. The statute did not deal with the
past or purport to grant or refuse a new trial in a case or cases
then pending, but performed the proper legislative function
of laying down a rule for the future in a matter as to which it
had authority to lay down rules. Whether the attempt to
grant a review of the motion in case of an appeal or writ of
error was valid is not before us. But certainly it does not seem
an extraordinary stretch of legislative power to say that if the
right to have a motion considered is lost in the lower court by
lapse of time, the motion may be considered on appeal. There
is no judgment by the legislature but simply a qualification of
the time limit if the case goes up.
Finally, it is argued that the sections construed as we construe them are inconsistent with the grant of common law jurisdiction to the courts by Congress. Rev. Stat. §§ 1868, 1908.
It is said that the right to grant new trials was a well recognized incident of common law jurisdiction, and that it cannot
be taken away or cut down by the territorial legislature. In
view of the provision in § 1866, that the jurisdiction given by
§ 1908 "shall be limited by law," and indeed apart from it, we
should hesitate to say that the territorial legislature was prevented by the grant of common law jurisdiction, in general
words, from doing away with new trials altogether. A rule
of practice like this does not touch jurisdiction in any proper
sense. Ferris v. Higley, 20 Wall. 375, cited by the appellant,
has no application. Apart from other differences, that was a
case of an attempt to confer original jurisdiction in civil and
criminal cases, both in chancery and common law, upon the
probate courts. We certainly see nothing to prohibit the local
legislature from making this not unusual or unreasonable rule.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 90. Argued December 11, 1903.-Decided January 4, 1904.

The balance of a regular bank account at the time of filing the petition is
a debt due to the bankrupt from the bank, and in the absence of fraud
or collusion between the bank and the bankrupt with the view of creating
a preferential transfer, the bank need not surrender such balance, but
may set it off against notes of the bankrupt held by it and prove its claim

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Latham G. Reed, with whom Mr. John M. Bowers was

The certification of his findings by a referee in bankruptcy
and the findings themselves are as binding as are the findings
of fact of any referee or single judge or the verdict of a jury,
unless manifestly unquestionably erroneous. In re Carver, 113

110 Fed. Rep. 143; Railway Co. v. Gordon, 151 U. S. 285.
A finding of fact dependent upon conflicting testimony by
a judge, or master or referee, who sees and hears the witnesses
testify, has every reasonable presumption in its favor, and
may not be set aside and modified unless it clearly appears
that there was an error or mistake upon his part. Tilghman
