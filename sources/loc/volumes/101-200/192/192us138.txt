'NEW YORK COUNTY NATIONAL BANK v. MASSEY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 90. Argued December 11, 1903.-Decided January 4, 1904.

The balance of a regular bank account at the time of filing the petition is
a debt due to the bankrupt from the bank, and in the absence of fraud
or collusion between the bank and the bankrupt with the view of creating
a preferential transfer, the bank need not surrender such balance, but
may set it off against notes of the bankrupt held by it and prove its claim
for the amount remaining due on the notes. Piriev. Chicago Title &
Trust Co., 182 U. S. 438, distinguished.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Latham G. Reed, with whom Mr. John M. Bowers was
on the brief, for appellant:
The certification of his findings by a referee in bankruptcy
and the findings themselves are as binding as are the findings
of fact of any referee or single judge or the verdict of a jury,
unless manifestly unquestionably erroneous. In re Carver, 113
Fed. Rep. 138; In re Stout, 109 Fed. Rep. 794; In re Covington,
110 Fed. Rep. 143; Railway Co. v. Gordon, 151 U. S. 285.
A finding of fact dependent upon conflicting testimony by
a judge, or master or referee, who sees and hears the witnesses
testify, has every reasonable presumption in its favor, and
may not be set aside and modified unless it clearly appears
that there was an error or mistake upon his part. Tilghman

of a depositor in a bank with the bank itself is that of debtor
and creditor. Bank of Republic v. Millard, 10 Wall. 152;

ed. 173; Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U. S. 499.
Transfers made in the usual and ordinary course of a trader's
business, or payments made at the time a debt matures and in
the usual mode of paying debts, are prima facie valid. Bank
v. Campbell, 14 Wall. 97; Driggs v. Moore, 1 Abb. C. C. 440.
If a transfer is made in the usual and ordinary course of
business of the bankrupt, the burden of proof will rest upon
the assignee. Collins v. Bell, 3 B. R. 587; Scammon v. Cole,
3 B. R. 393.
The bank was bound to deduct the amount of the bankrupt's deposit from the face value of the notes and was entitled
to prove its claim for the balance of the indebtedness, and
for that only. Sec. 68 of the bankruptcy law.
The bankruptcy law itself gives and enforces the right and
duty of set-off, and includes the common law right (and makes
a duty of it) of banker's lien. The act condemns, not every
transfer, but only such as it expressly prohibits; which are
only such as deplete or lessen the bankrupt's estate.
An exchange of values between an insolvent debtor and one
of his creditors does not constitute a preference, because in
such cases there is no diminution of the debtor's estate whereby
creditors may be injured. Cook v. Tullis, 18 Wall. 332; Clark
v. Iselin, 21 Wall. 378; Fox v. Gardner, 21 Wall. 480; Sawyer v.
Turpin, 91 U. S. 120,121; Stevens v. Blanchard, 3 Cush. 169.

the act. In re Myers, 99 Fed. Rep. 691; In Matter of Kalber,

when they were insolvent and their appropriation by the bank
in part satisfaction of the debt owed it by the bankrupts have
given the bank a preference. Ignorance of the insolvency is
immaterial. Piriev. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 180 U. S. 438.
The bank having received a preference, the doctrine of setoff cannot be invoked to undo and to make good what the
statute has declared is a "preference."

To say that the bank has a banker's lien does not save the
transaction from being a preference under the Bankruptcy
Act.
The lien of the bank does not come into existence until the
debt to the bank becomes due. The very cases cited by the
appellant bring out this point clearly.
There is nothing in the record showing any special agreement
giving the bank a lien upon the deposits at the time when
made, as was the case in Hatch v. Fourth National Bank, 147
N. Y. 184.
Even if there was a special agreement made at the time the
notes were discounted by the bank, it is amply settled by the
authorities decided under the present bankruptcy law that the
lien would not attach until actual possession took place. Wilson Brothers v. Nelson, 183 U. S. 191; Matthews v. Hardt, 79

MR. JusTIcE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing the order of the

OCTOBER TERMI, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

District Court affirming the order of the referee in bankruptcy,
allowing a claim against the estate of Stege & Brother. This
claim was allowed against the contention of the trustee .of the
bankrupt, that it could not be proved until the bank should
surrender a certain alleged preference given to it in contravention of the bankrupt act. The Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the order of the District Court, holding that the bank
must first surrender the preference before it could be allowed
to prove its claim. 116 Fed. Rep. 342. The Circuit Court of
Appeals made the following findings of fact:
" For a number of years past the bankrupts, George H. Stege
and Frederick H. Stege, were engaged, in the city and county
of New York, in the business of dealing in butter, eggs, &c., at
wholesale, under the firm name and style of Stege & Brother.
On January 27, 1900, they filed a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in the District Court, with liabilities of $67, 232.49 and
assets of $20,729.66, and upon the same day were duly adjudicated bankrupts. Among their liabilities there was an indebtedness of $40,000 to the New York County National Bank
for money loaned upon four promissory notes for $10,000 each.
The money was loaned to the bankrupts and the notes were
originally given as follows:
"April 26, 1899, $10,000, 6 months, due October 26, 1899.
"April 26, 1899, $10,000, 7 months, due November 26, 1899.
"June 26, 1899, $10,000, 4 months, due October 26, 1899.
"August 2, 1899, $10,000, 4 months, due December 2, 1899.
"None of these notes were paid when they fell due, but were
all renewed as follows:
"October 26, 1899, $10,000, 3 months, due January 26, 1900.
"November 26, 1899, $10,000, 75 days, due February 9, 1900.
"October 26, 1899, $10,000, 3 months, due January 26, 1900.
"December 2, 1899, $10,000, 69 days, due February 9, 1900.
"On January 23, 1900, in the morning, the bankrupts went
to the New York County National Bank and asked the officers
to have the two notes of $10,000 each, which fell due on January 26, extended. The bankrupts at that time informed the

Opinion of the Court.

bank officers that they were unable to pay the notes then about
to fall due. In the afternoon of the same day, January 23,
1900, the bankrupts again called upon the bank officers, and
at that time they delivered to them a statement of their assets
and liabilities, which statement was not delivered until after
the deposit of $3,884.47 had been made on that day. This
statement as of January 22, 1900, showed their assets to be
$19,095.67 and their liabilities $65,864.61.
"The bankrupts kept their bank account in the New York
County National Bank since May 6, 1899. On January 22,
1900, their balance in the bank was $218.50. On the same day
they deposited in, that account $536.83; on January 23, 1900,
$3,884.47; on January 25, 1900, $1,803.95, making a total of
$6,225.25 deposited in the three days mentioned. Of this
amount there was left in the bank account on the day of the
adjudication in bankruptcy, January 27, 1900, the sum of
$6,209.25, the bank having honored a check of Stege Brothers
after the date of all these deposits.
"At the first meeting of creditors, February 9, 1900, the
New York County National Bank ified its claim for $33,790.25.
"In its proof of claim the bank credited upon one of the notes
which became due on January 26, 1900, the deposit of $6,209.25.
The claim was allowed by the referee in the sum of $33,750.25,
being $40,000 less the amount on deposit in bank ($6,209.25),
.and a small rebate of interest on the unmatured notes. Some
of the creditors at this meeting reserved the right to move to
reconsider the claim of the New York County National Bank;
the referee granted this request. Afterwards the trustee, as
the representative of the creditors, moved before the referee
to disallow and to expunge from his list of claims the claim of
the New York County National Bank unless it surrendered the
amount of the deposit, namely, $6,209.25, which had been
credited by the bank upon one of the notes. The referee denied
that motion, and an appropriate order was made and entered.
The trustee thereupon duly filed his petition to have the quesUqi_ certified to the District Judge. The District Judge onl

the 25th day of November, 1901, made an order affirming the
order of the referee. From that order an appeal was duly
taken by the trustee to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The
deposits were made in the usual course of business; at the time
they were made Stege Brothers were insolvent."
As a conclusion of law, the Court of Appeals held that the
deposit would amount to a transfer enabling the bank to obtain a greater percentage of the debt due to it than other
creditors of the same class, and that allowance of the claim
should be refused unless the preference was surrendered. This
case requires an examination of certain provisions of the bankrupt law. Section 68 of that law provides:
"SEc. 68. Set-offs and counterclaims:
"(a.) In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between
the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor, the account shall be
stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the
balance only shall be allowed or paid.
"(b.) A set-off or counterclaim shall not be allowed in favor
of any debtor of the bankrupt which (1) is not provable against
the estate, or (2) was purchased by or transferred to him after
the filing of the petition or within four months before such
filing, with a view to such use and with knowledge or notice
that such bankrupt was insolvent or had committed an act of
bankruptcy."
Section 60 provides (prior to the amendment of February 5,
1903):
"SEc. 60. Preferred creditors: a. A person shall be deemed
to have given a preference if being insolvent he has .
made a transfer of any of his property, and the effect of the
.

.

.

transfer will be to enable any one of his creditors to

obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other such
creditors of the same class."
Section 57g provides (prior- to amendment of February 5,
1903): "The claims of creditors who have received preferences
shall not be allowed unless such creditors shall surrender the
preferences."

N. Y. COUNTY BANK v. MASSEY.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Considering, for the moment, section 68, apart from the
other sections, subdivision a contemplates a set-off of mutual
debts or credits between the estate of the bankrupt and the
creditor, with an account to be stated and the balance only to
be allowed and paid. Subdivision b makes certain specific
exceptions to this allowance of set-off, and provides that it
shall not be allowed in favor of the debtor of the bankrupt
upon an unproved claim or one transferred to the debtor after
the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, or within four months
before the filing thereof, with a view to its use for the purpose
of set-off, with knowledge or notice that the bankrupt was
insolvent or had committed an act of bankruptcy. Obviously,
the present case does not come within the exceptions to the
general rule made by subdivision b., It cannot be doubted
that, except under special circumstances, or where there is a
statute to the contrary, a deposit of money upon general account with a bank creates the relation of debtor and creditor.
The money deposited becomes a part of the general fund of the
bank, to be dealt with by it as other moneys, to be lent to customers, and parted with at the will of the bank, and the right
of the depositor is to have this debt repaid in whole or in part
by honoring checks drawn against the deposits. It creates an
ordinary debt, not a privilege or right of a fiduciary character.

by Mr Justice White, in the case of Davis v. Elmira Savings
Bank, 161 U. S. 275, 288: "The deposit of money by a customer
with his banker is one of loan, with the superadded obligation
that the money is to be paid, when demanded, by a check."
Scammon v. Kimball, 92 U. S. 362. It is true that the findings
of fact in this case establish that at the time these deposits
were made the assets of the depositors were considerably less
than their liabilities, and that they were insolvent, but there
is nothing in the findings to show that the deposit created
other than the ordinary relation between the bank and its
depositor. The check of the depositor was honored after this
deposit was made, and for aught that appears Stege Brothers

might have required the amount of the entire account without
objection from the bank, notwithstanding their financial condition.
We are to interpret statutes, not to make them. Unless
other sections of the law are controlling, or in order to give a
harmonious construction to the whole act, a different interpretation is required, it would seem clear that the parties stood
in the relation defined in section 68a, with the right to set
off mutual debts, the creditor being allowed to prove but
the balance of the debt.
Section 68a of the bankruptcy act of 1898 is almost a literal
reproduction of section 20 of the act of 1867. So far as we
have been able to discover the holdings were uniform under
that act that set-off should be allowed as between a bank and
a depositor becoming bankrupt. In re Petrie, 7 N. B. R. 332;
S. C., Fed. Cas. No. 11,040; Blairv. Allen, 3 Dill. 101; S. C., Fed.
Cas. No. 1483; Scammon v. Kimball, 92 U. S. 362. In Traders'
Bank v. Campbell, 14 Wall. 87, the right of set-off was not
relied upon, but a deposit was seized on a judgment which was
a preference.
But it is urged that under section 60a this transaction
amounts to giving a preference to the bank, by enabling it
to receive a greater percentage of its debts than other creditors of the same class. A transfer is defined in section 1 (25)
of the act to include the sale and every other and different
method of disposing of or parting with property, or the possession of property, absolutely or conditionally, as a payment,
pledge, mortgage, gift or security. While these sections are
not to be narrowly construed so as to defeat their purpose, no
more can they be enlarged by judicial construction to include
transactions not within the scope and purpose of the act.
This section 1 (25), read with sections 60a and 57g, requires
the surrender of preferences having the effect of transfers of
property "as payment, pledge, mortgage, gift or security
which operate to diminish the estate of the bankrupt and
prefer one creditor over another."

N. Y. COUNTY BANK v. MASSEY.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The law requires the surrender of such preferences given to
the creditor within the time limited in the act before he can
prove his claim. These transfers of property, amounting to
preferences, contemplate the parting with the bankrupt's property for the benefit of the creditor and the consequent diminution of the bankrupt's estate. It is such transactions, operating to defeat the purposes of the act, which under its terms are
preferences.
As we have seen, a deposit of money to one's credit in a bank
does not operate to diminish the estate of the depositor, for
when he parts with the money he creates at the same time, on
the part of the bank, an obligation to pay the amount of the
deposit as soon as the depositor may see fit to draw a check
against it. It is not a transfer of property as a payment,
pledge, mortgage, gift or security. It is true that it creates
a debt, which, if the creditor may set it off under section 68,
amounts to permitting a creditor of that class to obtain more
from the bankrupt's estate than creditors who are not in the
same situation, and do not hold any debts of the bankrupt
subject to set-off. But this does not, in our opinion, operate
to enlarge the scope of the statute defining preferences so as
to prevent set-off in cases coming within the terms of section 68a. If this argument were to prevail, it would in cases
of insolvency defeat the right of set-off recognized and enforced in the law, as every creditor of the bankrupt holding
a claim against the estate subject to reduction to the full
amount of a debt due the bankrupt receives a preference in
the fact that to the extent of the set-off he is paid in full.
It is insisted that this court in the case of Pirie v. Chicago
Title & Trust Co., 182 U. S. 438, held a payment of money to
be a transfer of property within the terms of the bankrupt act,
and when made by an insolvent within four months of the
filing of the petition in bankruptcy, to amount to a preference,
and that case is claimed to be decisive of this. In the Pirie
case the turning question was whether the payment of money
was a transfer within the meaning of the law, and it was held

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

that it was. There the payment of the money within the time
named in the bankrupt law was a parting with so much of
the bankrupt's estate, for which he received no obligation of
the debtor but a credit for the amount on his debt. This was
held to be a transfer of property within the meaning of the
law. It is not necessary to depart from the ruling made in
that case, that such payment was within the operation of the
law, while a deposit of money upon an open account subject
to check, not amounting to a payment but creating an obligation upon the part of the bank to repay upon the order of the
depositor, would not be. Of the case of Piriev. Chicago Title
& Trust Co., it was said in Jaquith v. Alden, 189 U. S. 78, 82:
"The judgment below was affirmed by this court, and it was
held that a payment of money was a transfer of property, and
when made on an antecedent debt by an insolvent was a preference within section 60a, although the creditor was ignorant
of the insolvency and had no reasonable cause to believe that
a preference was intended. The estate of the insolvent, as it
existed at the date of the insolvency, was diminished by the
payment, and the creditor who received it was enabled to
obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of the
creditors of the same class."
In other words, the Piriecase, under the facts stated, shows
a transfer of property to be applied upon the debt, made at
the time of insolvency of the debtor, creating a preference
under the terms of the bankrupt law. That case turned upon
entirely different facts, and is not decisive of the one now
before us. It is true, as we have seen, that in a sense the bank
is permitted to obtain a greater percentage of its claim against
the bankrupt than other creditors of the same class, but this
indirect result is not brought about by the transfer of property
within the meaning of the law. There is nothing in the findings to show fraud or collusion between the bankrupt and the
bank with a view to create a preferential transfer of the bankrupt's property to the bank, and in the absence of such showing we cannot regard the deposit as having other effect than

to create a debt to the bankrupt and not a diminution of his
estate.
In our opinion the referee and the District Court were right
in holding that the amount of the deposit could be set off
against the claim of the bank, allowing it to prove for the
balance, and the Circuit Court of Appeals, in holding that
this deposit amounted to a preference to be surrendered before proving the debt, committed error.

of the District Court affirmed; cause remanded to latter court.

ROYAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. MARTIN.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF PORTO RICO.
No. 86. Argued December 8,9,1903.-Decided January 11, 1904.
This court has jurisdiction to review, on writ of error, a final decision of
the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, where the value or sum in dispute
exceeds $5000, exclusive of costs. The Circuit Court of Appeals Act of
1891 does not apply to such a case.
Where a policy of insurance excepts loss happening during invasion, rebellion, etc., unless satisfactory proof be made that it was occasioned
by independent causes, a notice by the company, without demanding
proof, that it will not pay the loss because it was occasioned by one of
the excepted causes amounts to a waiver, and relieves the insured from
producing such proofs before commencing suit, and how the loss was
occasioned is for the jury to determine.
Where a policy for separate specified amounts on a building and goods contained in it provides that it shall cease to be in force as to any property
passing from the insured otherwise than by due process of law without
notice to, and endorsement by, the company, a transfer of all the goods
by the insured to a firm of which he is a silent partner, the active partners
having possession and control, is such an alienation as will avoid the
policy in respect to the goods, but not as to the building separately insured.
