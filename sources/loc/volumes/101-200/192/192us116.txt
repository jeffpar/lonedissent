Denver, State of Colorado, to collect $500, for the violation of
section 746 of ordinance No. 101 of the city. Plaintiff in error
was found guilty, and fined the sum of $50. On appeal to the
County Court he was also found guilty and fined $100. The
judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, and
thereupon the Chief Justice of the State allowed this writ of
error.
The case involves the constitutionality of sections 745 and
746 of the ordinance of the city of Denver. That question was
passed upon in Cronin v. Adams, just decided, ante, p. 108,
and on its authority the judgment is
Affirmed.

the word.
Extraneous evidence under the circumstances surrounding
this case was not admissible to show the intent of a testator.

the province of the Orphans' Court, which has a close-at-hand

MR. JusTIcE, HoLlies delivered the opinion of the court.
These are cross appeals from the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia. 14 App. D. C. 337. To avoid all questions of form there are also writs or error on the same grounds.
The appeal of Charles McIntire is from the overruling of exceptions to the final account of the administrator with the will
annexed of the estate of David McIntire, and presents two

OCTOBER TER]A, 1908.

questions, one of construction and one of administration outside the terms of the will. The probatd of the will already has
been before this court. 162 U. S. 383.
The question of construction is the main one. It is whether
the children of the testator's brothers, Edwin and Charles, take
per capita or per stirpes under the residuary clause of the following will:
"January 7th, 1880.
"This is my last will and testament.
"I David IcIntire. tin-plate worker, of this city (of) do will,
bequeath, or devise, to my nephews, and nieces, that is to say,
from July the first. 1st eighteen hundred and fifty-four. 1854
"To the opening of. on reading of this, paper. one thousand
three hundred and fifty dollars and sixty-four cents ($1,350.64)
is to be calculated at six (6) per cent. interest
"That amount whatever it may be is to be given to each of my
brother Edwin's children. The remainder if any, is to be
equally divided between my Brothers Edwin and Charles
children. David McIntire."
There was an addition and also an earlier document of January 1, 1880, which it is unnecessary to copy. At the date of
the will the brother Charles was living and had two sons,
Charles and Henry, the latter of whom died before the testator.
The brother Edwin had died, leaving six children, one of whom
died before the testator. The testator held promissory notes
of his brother Charles forÂ°S1350.63. The brother Charles also
now is dead.
The argument for a division per stirpes is this. Earlier in the
paper the testator had used the phrase "nephews and nieces,"
which it would have been natural to repeat had he intended to
make a division per capita. But instead of that he says "my
brothers Edwin and Charles children," which is not very different from "my brother Edwin's children and my brother
Charles' children," and orders an equal division "between"
them. "Between," if accurately used, imports that not more

Opinion of the Court.

than two persons or groups are set against each other, Ihrie's
Estate, 162 Pa. St. 369, 372; Records v. Fields, 155 Missouri, 314,
322, and those groups are earmarked and shown to be regarded
as groups by naming the parents from which respectively they
come.- The equality of division is an equality between the
groups. See Hall v. Hall, 140 Massachusetts, 267, 271. This
mode of distribution has the recommendation that it follows
the rule in cases of intestacy. Raymond v. Hillhouse, 45 Connecticut, 467, 474. See further Alder v. Beall, 11 G. & J. 123,
explained in Plummer v. Shepherd, 94 Maryland, 466, 470.
But the court is of opinion that the general rule of construction
must prevail according to which, in the case of a gift to the
children of several persons described as standing in a certain
relation to the testator, the objects of the gift take per capita
and not per stirpes. Walker v. Griffin, 11 Wheat. 375, 379;
Balcom, v. Haynes, 14 Allen, 204; Hill v. Bowers, 120 Massachusetts, 135. The fact that one of the parents was living at
the date of the will is deemed sufficient to exclude a reference
to the statute of distributions. Blackler v. Webb, 2 P. Wins.
383; Bryant v. Scott, 1 Dev. & Bat. Eq. (N. C.) 155, 157. And
with regard to the word "between," the will is an illiterate
will, and as the popular use of the word is not accurate no
conclusion safely can be based upon that. See Maddox v.
State, 4 H. & J. 539; Brittain v. Carson, 46 Maryland, 186;
Collins v. Feather, 52 W. Va. 107; Lord v. Moore, 20 Conriecticut, 122; Pitney v. Brown, 44 Illinois, 363; Farmerv. Kimball,
46 N. H. 435, 439; Burnet v. Burnet, 30 N. J. Eq. 595; Myres
v. Myres, 23 How. Pr. 410; Waller v. Forsythe, 1 Phillips' Eq.
(N. C.) 353.
The other error assigned on behalf of Charles McIntire is
that the court charged the estate with $11,500, fees paid to
counsel for services in defending the will against the attack of
the said Charles and his father. The amount was paid in different sums by orders of court, in several instances on the petition of the children of Edwin, one of whom was the administrator with the will annexed, and was directed to be charged

192 U. S.

against the interest of those children in the first instance, but
without prejudice to an application to have it finally charged
against the estate. On the allowance of the account it was
charged against the estate. We are of opinion that the charge
was proper. There is no contest over the amount. It was
the proper business and duty of the administrator to defend
the will, and he was entitled to a reasonable allowance for what
he had to pay in doing so. The only just alternative would
be to charge counsel fees as costs against the losing party,
which would have been less favorable to the appellant. The
general proposition is not disputed, but it is said that in this
case the legatees retained the counsel and therefore ought to
pay them. The other legatees as well as the administrator
no doubt had a share in calling the counsel in. But that did
not matter. The services were services to the estate in maintaining the testator's will, they were adopted by the administrator and the usual rule must prevail. It is said that there
was no application to change the original order and no chance
to be heard against it. But plainly this cannot be true. As
observed by the court below, allowing the account changed
the order and charged the fees on the estate. Whatever want
of formality there may have been, the appellant had the right
and opportunity to object and except to the account, as well
on this ground as others, and he used it. The precise mode in
which the allowance appeared upon the account is not material,
but may be explained in a word or two. The payments were
made by the solicitors of the parties while they had the assets
in their hands, as will be stated in a moment. They rendered
their account, crediting themselves with those payments generally. Then they turned over the assets, less these payments
and their commissions, to the administrator. In the account
of the latter he charges himself only with the net amount
received by him, and makes no charge for the counsel fees
against the legatees, and thus throws the burden on the residue
of the estate.
The foregoing considerations dispose of the appeal of Charles

McINTIRE v. MoINTIRE.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

McIntire. There is a cross-appeal by the administrator from
the allowance of certain exceptions to the account. The first
error assigned is that he was denied commissions. The reason
was this. On February 19, 1885, pending the controversy on
the will and other controversies, an order was made by consent
of all parties, to the effect,, among other things, that Edwin A.
McIntire should act as administrator, "but without any allowance for commission or other charge for his services as such
administrator," and that the assets should remain under the
control of the court (they having been paid into court under
another order of the same date, passed in an equity cause).
The next year, all debts having been paid except a disputed
note, another order was made by consent, turning over the
assets to the solicitors of the parties. The funds. were managed by the solicitors until the will was established, when on
petition of the administrator offering to give an additional
bond, the assets were put into his hands on July 7, 1896, upon
his filing a bond for $100,000. It is argued that this restoration of the assets to the hands of the administrator with the
duty of distribution and the requirement of a new bond, relieved him of the terms of the bargain on which it was agreed
that he should act, if that bargain ever was valid. We think
it enough to say that we perceive no such change of situation from what was anticipated as should have that result.
Whether the bargain was good or bad, the services were rendered under it, and therefore purported to be gratuitous.
The law does not forbid gratuitous services, even in fiduciary
relations, and if acts purport to be done gratuitously no claim
for payment can be founded upon them at a later date. See
Johnson v. Kimball, 172 Massachusetts, 398, 400, 401.
A partial distribution was made under an order of December 9, 1897, of $2800 to each of the children of Edwin, and of
$6022.02 to Charles Mclntire.
Complaint is made because
the sums paid to Edwin's children were charged against the
legacies to them instead of against their share in the residue,
whereas the payment to Charles was charged to his share in

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

the residue, which was all he had. It is said that this mode
stops the running of interest on the legacies to the disadvantage
of the legatees. But we see no ground for complaint. Of
course the liabilities of the estate in the form of legacies as well
as those in the form of debts are to be satisfied before the
residue exists. In the absence of a definite understanding at
the time, partial payments naturally would be taken as working that satisfaction and as stopping the liability of the estate
for interest. The same principle applies to another sum which
four of the legatees agreed to treat as having been paid to them
as stated below.
A third error alleged concerns $500, part of the counsel fees
in addition to the sums mentioned above. This was paid upon
a petition of Edwin's children, stating that the counsel "had
been managing their interests," and under an order directing
the same to be charged to their distributive shares without
reserving any right to apply to have it finally charged to the
estate. We are not disposed to overturn the decision that this
payment must be borne by the legatees, as they were content
to be charged with it in the order allowing the payment.
The next error assigned is that the administrator was charged
with interest on an item of $10,000 from April 18, 1884, to
February 25, 1885. This sum was alleged to have been received by the administrator and improperly omitted from the
inventory. The matter was referred to arbitrators. In order
to avoid a family quarrel, if possible, the four sisters of the
administrator agreed to be charged with $2500 each, as on a
partial distribution, and gave receipts on February 25, 1885.
Thereupon the administrator requested the arbitrators to find
that he received and must account for the sum, and they did
so. Very probably the matter of interest was overlooked, but
the result of the transaction is that the administrator stands
charged on the record as owing the estate $10,000 until the
time of distribution to the sisters, and of course that he must
pay interest at the legal rate. It is not a case of charging interest not earned against an administrator having funds in his

GERMAN SAVINGS SOCIETY v. DORMITZER.
192 U. S.

Syllabus.

hands as such, but it is a charge against him for money which
he ought to have put into his account and held as an identified
fund, but did not. The motives which induced his consent to
charge himself are immaterial. Whatever they were, the effect
of the record is the same.
Finally, the administrator objects to being charged with
interest on an item of $1419.73, which he received in 1891.
There is perhaps more doubt about this than concerning the
more important matters, but we shall not disturb the decree.
The assets had been ordered to be paid into court and then
had been transferred, as above stated, to the solicitors of the
parties as custodians. The administrator did not pay this
sum over, but kept it in his own hands.
Decree affirmed.

GERMAN SAVINGS AND LOAN SOCIETY v. DORMITZER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
No. 104. Argued December 16,17, 1903.-Decided January 4, 1904.
A writ of error will not be dismissed on the ground that the Federal question was not set up in the court below, and that the decision rested on
two grounds, one of which was estoppel and independent of the Federal
question, when the plaintiff in error had insisted upon his constitutional
rights as soon as the occasion arose, and the opinion deals expressly with
such rights.
A decree of divorce may be impeached collaterally in the courts of another
State by proof that the court granting it had no jurisdiction, even when
the record purports to show jurisdiction and appearance of the, other
party, without violating the full faith and credit clause of the Federal
Constitution. Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14.
The facts that a resident of a State after selling out his property and
business went to another State, bought land and decided to locate there
are sufficient for the courts of the latter State to find thereon that he
had changed his domicil and that the courts of the State from which he
had removed had no jurisdiction of an action subsequently brought by
him for divorce.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
