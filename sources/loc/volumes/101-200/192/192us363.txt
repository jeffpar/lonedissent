THOMAS v. UNITED STATES.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

THOMAS v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 43. Argued December 4,1903.-Decided February 23, 1904.

The words duties, imposts and excises were used comprehensively in the
Constitution to cover customs and excise duties imposed on importation,
consumption, manufacture and sale of certain commodities, privileges,
particular business transactions, vocations and the like. The stamp duty
on sales of shares of stock in corporations imposed by the War Revenue
Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 448, falls within that category and was not a direct
tax.

ground that the act of June 13, 1898, 30 Stat. 448, c. 448,

The demurrer was overruled, the court, Thomas, J., delivering
an opinion. 115 Fed. Rep. 207.
Trial was had, defendant found guilty, and judgment rendered, sentencing him to pay a fine of five hundred dollars.
The case was then brought here on writ of error.

A tax upon the sale of articles is in substance a tax upon the
articles themselves and is invalid if a tax laid in the same manner upon the articles themselves is invalid. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275,

A tax upon the sales of shares or certificates of stock is in
substance a tax upon the shares or certificates themselves. It
is therefore a tax upon property and is a direct tax within the
meaning of the Constitution. The war revenue tax upon the
sales or shares or certificates of stock is not laid in proportion
to the census or enumeration or apportioned among the States
according to their numbers and is therefore unconstitutional
and void.

Congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution the foregoing power. The
selection of the means rests with Congress. Unless these
means are forbidden by the Constitution, the courts will not
interfere. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421; Fong

Constitution heretofore pointed out, the taxing power of Congress reaches all kinds and descriptions of property and all
rights and privileges incident thereto. License Tax Cases, 5

As to the power of Congress, through classification, to select
subjects of taxation, the question always is, when a classification is made, whether there is any reasonable ground for it or
whether it is only simply arbitrary, based upon no real
distinction and entirely unnatural. If the classification be

The constitutionality of a law making an exaction for purposes of revenue depends upon its operation and effect, and not
upon the form it may be made to assume. License Tax Cases,
5 Wall. 462.
The absolute and unlimited power to tax is inherent in every
sovereignty. In adopting the Constitution, however, the people of the United States delegated to the General Government
this power to tax subject to certain exceptions and limitations.
It is apparent from this express grant of power to tax that
certain limitations or restrictions were imposed upon the purpose for which taxes could be laid and collected, and which are
as follows:
1. To pay the debts of the United States; 2. To provide for
the common defence of the United States; and, 3. To provide
for the general welfare of the United States. 1 Story on the
Constitution, §§ 907, 926; 7 Jefferson's Works, 757; Tucker on
the Constitution, 222; Judson on Taxation (1903), § 480.
These limitations as to the purpose for which a tax may be
constitutionally laid and collected are so general and far reaching in their nature as to practically amount to no limitation.

Whatever may be the precise meaning of the phrase "direct
tax" as understood and used by various writers on the subject
of political economy, it is only necessary to an intelligent discussion of the validity of the law under consideration to ascertain and determine what is understood by the phrase "direct
tax" within the meaning of the Constitution. Nicol v. Ames,
173 U. S. 509, 515.
The following are the only direct taxes, within the meaning
of the Constitution, which have been decided between 1789 and
1896, to be such by the opinions of this court: 1. A capitation or
poll tax. The Constitution in express terms regards a capitation or poll tax as a direct tax. 2. A tax on lands (that is, a
direct tax on lands such as is ordinarily imposed). Hylton v.
United States, 3 Dalla§, 171; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7

Wells's Theory and Practice of Taxation.
The tax here imposed is not a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution, for the reason that it is impossible to
apportion it among the several States according to population.
It is a tax in the nature of a duty or excise upon transactions
in business activity or forms of commercial dealing. Congress
has the power to declare that any person who shall engage in
the business or occupation of buying and selling certificates of
stock shall pay a tax measured by the price realized. The
power to impose privilege and occupation taxes exists independently and concurrently in the state and Federal governments, subject to the constitutional restrictions; in the state
governments subject to the exclusive rights conferred on Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and in the Federal
government subject to the prohibition of any interference with
the internal regulations of the State. Ward v. Maryland, 12
Wall. 418; License Tax Cases, 5 How. 504; Nathan v. Louisiana,
8 How. 73; Dobbins v. Erie County, 16 Peters, 435; Railway Co.
v. Collector, 100 U. S. 593, 598.
It is in the nature of a duty or excise upon the contract of sale
itself, referring only to the fact that the subject-matter of the
sale must be a certificate of stock as the basis or ground for
classification. Cases already cited and Treat v. White, 181 U.
S. 264, 268. It is closely analogous to the tax involved in
Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171.
The tax is laid upon the privilege or facility afforded the
owner of the stock, under and by virtue of the laws of the State

authorizing the formation of the corporation, to sell and dispose
of his property in the form of a certificate of stock.
Taxes of this nature have been uniformly regarded by the legislative and executive departments of the Government since its
foundation as indirect within the meaning of the Constitution.
An act of Congress imposing a tax directly upon all shares or
certificates of stock in all corporations and associations would be
constitutional. A fortiori, is a law constitutional which merely
taxes the sale, or agreement to sell, such property. Pacific

MR.

CHIEF

JusTIcE FULLER, after making the foregoing

statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
By the fTrst clause of section eight of article I of the Constitution, Congress is empowered "to lay and collect taxes, duties,
imposts and excises," "but all duties, imposts and excises shall
be uniform throughout the United States."
This divisi6n of taxation into two classes is recognized
throughout the Constitution.
By clause three of section two, representatives and direct
taxes are required to be apportioned according to the enumeration prescribed, and by clause four of section nine, no capitation or other direct tax can be laid except according to that
enumeration.
By clause one of section nine, the migration or importation
of persons by the States was not to be prohibited prior to 1808,
but a tax or duty could be imposed on such importation, not
exceeding ten dollars for each person.
By clause five it is provided: "No tax or duty shall be laid
on articles exported from any State."
By clause two of section ten, no State can, "without the
VOL. cxcxi-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports
or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws." By clause three the States are
forbidden, without the consent of Congress, to "lay any duty
of tonnage."
And these two classes, taxes so-called, and "duties, imposts
and excises," apparently embrace all forms of taxation contemplated by the Constitution. As was observed in Pollock
v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, 157 U. S. 429, 557:
"Although there have been from time to time intimations
that there might be some tax which was not a direct tax nor
included under the words 'duties, imposts and excises,' such
a tax for more than one hundred years of national existence
has as yet remained undiscovered, notwithstanding the stress
of particular circumstances has invited thorough investigation
into sources of revenue."
The present case involves a stamp tax on a memorandum
or contract of sale of a certificate of stock, which plaintiff in
error claims was unlawfully exacted because not fallihg within
the class of duties, imposts and excises, and being, on the contrary, a direct tax on property.
There is no occasion to attempt to confine the words duties,
imposts and excises to the limits of precise definition. We
think that they were used comprehensively to cover customs
and excise duties imposed on importation, consumption, manufacture and sale of certain commodities, privileges, particular business transactions, vocations, occupations and the
like.
Taxes of this sort have been repeatedly sustained by this
court, and distinguished from direct taxes under the Constitution. As in Hylton v. United States, 3 Dallas, 171, on the use
of carriages; in Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509, on sales at exchanges or boards of trade; in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S.41,
on the transmission of property from the dead to the living;
in Treat v. White, 181 U. S.264, on agreements to sell shares
of stock denominated "calls" by New York stock brokers; in

Patton v. Brady, 184 U. S. 608, on tobacco manufactured for
consumption.
Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, and Fairbankv. United
States, 181 U. S. 283, are not in point. In the one the clause
of the Constitution was considered which forbids any State,
without the consent of Congress, to "lay any imposts or duties
on imports or exports," and in the other, that "no tax or duty
shall be laid on articles exported from any State." The distinction between direct and indirect taxes was not involved
in either case.
The sale of stocks is a particular business transaction in the
exercise of the privilege afforded by the laws in respect to corporations of disposing of property in the form of certificates.
The stamp duty is contingent on the happening of the event
of sale, and the element of absolute and unavoidable demand
is lacking. As such it falls, as stamp taxes ordinarily do,
within the second class of the forms of taxation.
Judgment affirmed.

Ho. 141. Argued January 22,1904.-Decided February 23,1904..

Although suits may involve the Constitution or laws of the United States,
they are not suits arising thereunder where they do not turn on a controversy between the parties in regard to the operation thereof, on the facts.
Nor does a case arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States
unless it appears from plaintiff's own statement, in the outset, that some
title, right, privilege or immunity on which recovery depends will be defeated by one construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States
or sustained by the opposite construction.
