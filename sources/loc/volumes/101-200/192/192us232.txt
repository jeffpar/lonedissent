OCTOI3ER TERM,1, 1908.
Statement of the Case.

SHAPPIRIO v. GOLDBERG.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 87. Argued December 9, 1903.-Decided January 18, 1904.

To ascertain its jurisdiction this court looks not to a single feature of the
case but to the entire controversy.
Where the prayer for relief is either for conveyance of land worth less than
$5000 or for a rescission of a contract of sale and repayment of the purchase money of over $5000, the necessary amount is involved to give this
court jurisdiction of an appeal from the Court of Appeals of the District
of Columbia.
Where the issues are mainly those of fact, in the absence of clear showing
of error, the findings of the two lower courts will be accepted as correct.
Where a party desires to rescind on the ground of misrepresentation or
fraud, he must upon the discovery of the fraud announce his purpose and
adhere to it. If he continues to treat the property as his own the right
of rescission is gone and he will be held bound by the contract.
THIS was an action begun in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by Mary Shappirio and Jacob Shappirio, her
husband, against Minnie D. Goldberg and George Goldberg,
her husband, having for its object equitable relief because of
alleged fraud of the respondents in the sale of certain property
in Washington, District of Columbia, to the complainant,
Mary Shappirio.
It appears that the sale was made through one Richold, a
broker in real estate. George Goldberg was the owner of the
property, and by memorandum made on May 11, 1900, authorized Richold to sell the property known as lots Nos. 1245
and 1247, being part of lot 28, square 977, fronting 34 feet on
11th street S. E., by eighty feet deep to an alley. Richold
sold the property to Jacob Shappirio, for whom he was seeking
an investment, for the price of $6000. The terms were cash,
$100 having been paid down at the making of the sale. This

property, having two buildings upon it, and being part of
lot 28, is described as follows:
"Beginning for the same at the southeast corner of said lot
and running thence north on Eleventh street thirty-four (34)
feet; thence west eighty (80) feet eight (8) inches to an alley;
thence south on said alley fourteen (14) feet; thence east
eighteen (18) feet; thence south twenty (20) feet, and thence
east sixty-two (62) feet eight (8) inches to the place of beginning."
In the rear of the premises there was a strip 20 by 30 feet,
having upon it a shed or stable, which, before the sale, was in
the possession of Goldberg under an arrangement for its use,
and was used by him in connection with the premises. This
piece was not fenced off at the time of sale and might well be
taken to be a part of the premises by any person examining
the same without accurate knowledge of the extent of the
property actually owned by Goldberg. The annexed plat
shows the part of lot 28 covered by the description in the deed
and the part of lot 2 in dispute:

Although the purchase was made by Jacob Shappirio, the
deed was made to Mary Shappirio, June 5, 1900. On September 28, 1900, a conveyance by the owner of the title to lot 2
was made of the part of that lot in the rear of the premises to
Minnie D. Goldberg, wife of George Goldberg, for the consideration of $300. Mary Shappirio and Jacob Shappirio on

June 5, 1900, executed a deed of trust upon the property conveyed to her in the sum of $4500. In the trust deed the
property was accurately described.
After the property had been conveyed to Mary Shappirio it
was rented to Goldberg, the vendor, who continued to occupy
the same for eleven months. Upon asking a reduction of the
rent, which was refused, Goldberg left the premises. On
May 18, 1901, the present bill was filed, in which it was charged
that Goldberg, in order to induce the sale in question, falsely
represented that the property in the rear of lot 28 belonged to
him, and would be included in the property sold, and notwithstanding the appearance of the property and the representations of Goldberg, the part conveyed did not include the part
of lot 2 in the rear of lot 28; that George Goldberg afterwards
purchased the property, part of lot 2, and caused the same to
be conveyed to Minnie D. Goldberg, his wife, as a part of a
scheme to defraud the plaintiff. That the wife was a party to
the fraud, and had no interest in the property except to hold
it for her husband.
The bill prays that this parcel of ground, part of lot 2, be
decreed to be held by Minnie D. Goldberg for the use of the
plaintiff, Mary Shappirio, and be conveyed to her. If this
relief cannot be granted, the prayer is that the sale be rescinded,
and Goldberg be required to pay back the amount of the purchase money, with costs and charges, and upon default of
payment the property be sold.
A general denial of the allegations of fraud and deceit is made
in the answer, together with the averment that the plaintiffs
relied upon their own investigation, and if they were deceived
as to the extent of the property, it was the result of the want
of due care upon their part.
In the Supreme Court the bill of the complainants was dismissed, which decree was affirmed in the Court of Appeals.
Mr. Leo Simmons for appellants:
The evidence shows that the appellees have made false

statements: First, about the building of the stable; second,
about the occupancy of the yard and stable; third, about the
fact of Goldberg having said to Shappirio that the small piece
of land and stable did not belong to him; and fourth, about
the corroborative evidence in relation to the animals not being
about the premises, at the time of the negotiation of the sale;
and fifth, about Mrs. Goldberg having paid for the small piece
of land with her own funds, each and every one of which was
absolutely false, some admitted so and others proven so beyond doubt.
The decree below should be reversed and the case remanded
with directions to enter a decree for the enforcement of the
contract as originally made. If not the contract should be
rescinded as prayed in the alternative.
The following authorities, among others, support appellant's
contention. For what constitutes fraud and misrepresentation,

Mr. Thomas M. Fields for appellees, submitted:
The appeal should be dismissed. The actual amount is only
$6000 for the value of the property less the deed of trust of
$4500. There is a want of necessary parties. On the merits
appellants have no case. 14 A. & E. Ency. (2d ed.) 148.
When proofs of equitable grounds for relief fail, the jurisdiction of a court of equity also fails. Consent of parties cannot give equity jurisdiction of a case properly triable at law.

192 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

Where a party desires to rescind a contract upon the ground
of mistake or fraud he must, upon the discovery of the facts,
at once announce his purpose and adhere to it. If he be silent
and continue to treat the property as his own he will be held
to have waived the objection and will be conclusively bound
by the contract, as if the mistake or fraud had not occurred.

U. S. 78; Atlantic Delaine Co. v. James, 94 U. S. 207;

When in a court of equity it is proposed to set aside, annul,
or correct a written instrument for fraud or mistake in the execution, the testimony on which this is done must be clear,
unequivocal, and convincing, and not a mere preponderance
of evidence which leaves the matter in doubt. United States

The mere refusal of a party to perform a parol contract for
the sale of lands is not such a fraud as will give a court of equity

Courts will not assume to make a contract for the parties
which they did not choose to make for themselves. Morgan
County v. Allen, 103 U. S. 515. Nor will they incorporate into
a sealed instrument any covenant not there and which cannot
be legally implied from any other covenant therein, although
the contract, as expressed, may seem much in favor of one
party, and the omission of a covenant was clearly occasioned
by mistake. D. & H. Canal Co. v. Pennsylvania Coal Co., 8
Wall. 276; Gavinzel v. Crump, 22 Wall. 308; Robbins v. Clarks,

MR. JUSTICE DAY, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
The first question raised for our consideration involves the

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

jurisdiction of this court on appeal, it being claimed that the
matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, does not exceed the sum
of $5000. By the act of February 9, 1893, chapter 74, 27
Stat. 434, jurisdiction to review the final judgments of the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is given where
the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of $5000, exclusive of
costs. In determining this question we may look to the allegations and prayer of the bill to ascertain the relief sought and
the real extent of the controversy between the parties. The
bill contains a prayer for the conveyance of the small strip of
ground, which was purchased for $300, and if that were the
only subject-matter of the suit, the amount required to give
this court the right of review would not be in controversy.
But if this relief is denied, the complainants seek, in the alternative, to have the contract rescilided and the payment of the
sum of S6000, the purchase money, with costs and interest,
decreed against the respondents. Upon the pleadings we are
of opinion that this sum is also in dispute between the parties,
and therefore this court has jurisdiction. To ascertain the
right of jurisdiction in such a case we look not to a single
feature of the case, but to the entire controversy between the
parties. Stinson v. Dousman, 20 How. 461.
In this case the issues are mainly those of fact, and in the
absence of clear showing of error the findings of the two lower
courts will be accepted as correct. Stuart v. Hayden, 169 U. S.
1; Dravo v. Fabel, 132 U. S. 487. An examination of the record
in the light of these findings does not enable us to reach the
conclusion that error has been committed to the prejudice of
the appellants.
As to what was said by Goldberg at the time of the purchase
of the property in conversation with Richold, the broker, and
at the time the premises were visited by Shappirio with a view
to purchase, there is much conflict of testimony. The use of
the premises as a connected whole might well lead the purchaser to believe, in the absence of accurate knowledge, that
it was all under the ownership of one person, and would be

SjAPPIRIO v. GOLI)BERG.

Opinion of the Court.

included in the sale of the property to him; and, as said by the
Court of Appeals, we believe that Shappirio may have been
ignorant of the true condition of the title. But it was also
found by that court that a correct description of the property
was given in the deed and recorded chain of title. Richold,
who made the sale, was entrusted by Shappirio with the examination of the deed and title, and thirty days were given to
complete the purchase. For this purpose Richold was the
agent of Shappirio, and it not appearing in the proof that he
was misled by the representations of Goldberg, or that by any
scheme or plan he was kept from a full examination of the title
and the description of the property contained in the deed
furnished, he must be held chargeable with knowledge which
the opportunity before him afforded to investigate the extent
and nature of the property conveyed and which he undertook
to examine for the purchaser. It is true that Richold testifies
that he was misled by the silence of Goldberg and by the situation and use of the property, and stoutly denies that he had the
knowledge which a reading of the accurate description of the
deed would give. But he undertook to investigate the matter
and report upon the title. A casual reading of the description
in the deed or examination of the recorded plat would have
shown that the premises were not of a uniform depth of eighty
feet, and had the L-shape extension in the rear of the lot,
which excludes any part of lot 2 from the premises conveyed.
For the purpose of this examination Richold was the agent of
Shappirio, and his knowledge and means of information must
be imputed to the purchaser. There are cases where misrepresentations are made which deceive the purchaser, in which
it is no defence to say that had the plaintiff declined to believe
the representations and investigated for himself he would not
have been deceived. Mead v. Bunn, 32 N. Y. 275. But such
cases are to be distinguished from the one under consideration.
When the means of knowledge are open and at hand or furnished to the purchaser or his agent and no effort is made to
prevent the party from using them, and especially where the
VOL. oxcii-1 6

192 U. S.

purchaser undertakes examination for himself, he will not be
heard to say that he has been deceived to his injury by the
misrepresentations of the vendor. Slaughter'sAdmr. v. Gerson,
13 Wall. 379; Southern Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U. S. 247;
Farrarv. Churchill, 135 U. S. 609; Farnsworth v. Duffner, 142
U. S. 43.
If this action is viewed as one to rescind a contract, in the
light of the testimony and the findings of the courts below, the
appellants stand upon no better ground.
It is well settled by repeated decisions of this court that
where a party desires to rescind upon the ground of misrepresentation or fraud, he must upon the discovery of the fraud
announce his purpose and adhere to it. If he continues to
treat the property as his own the right of rescission is gone,
and the party will be held bound by the contract. Grymes v.
Sanders, 93 U. S. 55; McLean v. Clapp, 141 U. S. 429. In
other words, when a party discovers that he has been deceived
in a transaction of this character he may resort to an action at
law to recover damages, or he may have the transaction set
aside in which he has been wronged by the rescission of the
contract. If he choose the latter remedy, he must act promptly,
"Announce his purpose and adhere to it," and not by acts of
ownership continue to assert right and title over the property
as though it belonged to him. In the present case, some
months before the beginning of this action, probably in October, 1900, Shappirio learned that the conveyance did not include the premises, part of lot 2, in the rear of lot 28. It may
be that the mere lapse of time in this case would not of itself
have defeated the right to rescind, as a purchaser has a reasonable time in which to make election of such remedy after discovery of the fraud, Neblett v. Macfarland, 92 U. S. 101, 105,
but he cannot after such discovery treat the property as his
own and exercise acts of ownership over it which show an
election to regard the same as still his and at the same time
preserve his right to rescission. In the present case, after
discovering that the part of lot 2 had not been conveyed by the

COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK v. WEINHARD. 243

Statement of the Case.

deed, Shappirio collected rents for some months upon the
property, corresponded with Goldberg as to future terms of
rental, declined to reduce the rent, made some repairs upon
the property and performed other acts of ownership. This
conduct is wholly inconsistent with an election to undo the
transaction and stand upon his right to rescind the contract.
We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals
affirming the decree of the Supreme Court, and it is
Affirmed.
