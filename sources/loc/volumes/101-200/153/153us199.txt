THE EDWIN I. MORRISON.'
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 227.

Argued January 24,1894. -Decided

April 30, 1894.

When it is agreed by a charter party, on the part of the vessel, that she
shall be tight, staunch, strong, and in every way fitted for the voyage,
the owner is bound to see that the vessel is seaworthy and suitable for
the service on which she is to be employed, and he is not excused by the
fact that a defect is latent and unknown to him; but no obligation in
that respect rests upon the owner of the cargo.
In a suit in admiralty, where the libellant sought to recover for injuries
to a cargo caused by the vessel taking in water through a hole in her
side, made by the breaking away of the cap from one of the bilge-pump
holes, and where the defence was that such breaking was caused by a
danger of the sea within the exception in the charter party and bills of
lading, the court below, after finding that such bilge-pumps were not
unusual, and describing them and the dangers to be apprehended from
them, and after finding that before sailing the cap and plate showed no
indications of looseness, in an examination which, after detailing it,
was found to be such as a reasonably prudent master might be expected
to give, and after finding the condition of the hole at the end of the
voyage, found further that "at the time of the contract and lading of
cargo and commencement of voyage the vessel was tight, staunch, and
strong, and in every way fitted for the contemplated voyage;" that
"there was no latent defect in the vessel which contributed to the
injury to the cargo;" and that "the whole of said damage to cargo was
caused by a danger of the sea, and was within the exception in charter
party and bills of lading." Held,
(1) That these were findings determined by the interpretation which the
law put upon the circumstances of the transaction as stated in
the previous findings, and, as such, open to revision here;
(2) That these deductions were incorrect, and the specific conclusions
of law did not follow.

to recover for the damage done to a cargo of guano by sea
water taken aboard on January 10, 1884, on her voyage from
Weymouth, Massachusetts, to Savannah, Georgia. The libel
set up the charter, the loading, the bills of lading, the sailing
from Weymouth, the arrival at Savannah, and the delivery of
the cargo in a damaged condition; and also alleged that the
schooner, when she left Weymouth and before, "was not
tight, staunch, strong, and every way fitted for said voyage
as agreed;" "and that the cap was gone from off the bilgepump hole on the port side of said schooner, or was then so
loosely, insecurely and negligently fastened and screwed that
the same worked and came off without any danger of the sea
intervening, whereby said vessel was unseaworthy and unfit
for said voyage, or after leaving port said cap was removed
and not properly and securely replaced and screwed down, or
was negligently and improperly loosened and left insecure by
those in charge of said schooner, so that by the unseaworthiness of said schooner or by the negligence and improper navigation of those in charge of her, said cap came off from said
pump-hole without any danger of the sea," and that about
seven feet of water was admitted through it into the hold
and upon the cargo.
The answer admitted the charter, shipment, bills of lading,
sailing, arrival, and delivery of the cargo in a damaged condition, and in excuse thereof alleged: "That on said voyage the
said vessel encountered very rough and tempestuous weather,
in consequence of which she shipped large quantities of water,
and was greatly damaged by the seas, and it was found on
the arrival of the said vessel at Savannah that her said cargo
or a portion thereof was damaged by the said perils of the
seas encountered on the said voyage, or from causes excepted
in the said contract or contracts of affreightment."
The District Court found that nine-tenths of the damage to
the cargo was occasioned by sea water taken in through the
bilge-pump hole on the port side, and that the vessel was not
seaworthy in respect of the proper security of this port cap
and plate, and rendered a decree in favor of libellant. The
opinion is reported in 2T Fed. Rep. 136.

THE EDWIN I. MORRISON.
Statement of the Case.

The schooner sailed on the 5th of January, and, according
to the log, on the afternoon of January 9 met a very strong

gale and heavy seas, and shipped great quantities of water.
The log of January 10 read as follows:
"This day begins with a strong westerly gale and sea still
running very high. At 8 A.M., set two-reefed foresail; set
storm-trysail and hove vesseZ to, heading about south; find that
the vessel is making water faster than we can pump it out
with both pumps, the men not being able to wo'k at pumping
steadily because of heavy seas sweeping her decks.
"(NOTE.- The words in italics are inserted on margin of
log in lead pencil.)
"Sounded pumps and find that she has 7 ft. of water in
the hold.
"(NOTE. - The figure 7 is written over an erasure.)
"Out the boat lashings and got all ready to leave the vessel,
when found that the cap had washed off the bilge-pump hole
on the port side; nailed a piece of sheet leid over it and started
both pumps agoing; pumped two hours and sound again and
find that we are freeing her very rapidly. So ends this day.
No latitude; no longitude."
The bilge-pump hole referred to in the above extract was a
hole in the port side in the waterway, a short distance only in
front of the poop, and ran down through the waterway between the ceiling and the skin of the ship. It was from
three to four inches in diameter, and covered by a brass
plate about four inches square, countersunk into the timber,
through which was a hole, covered by a brass cap, which
screwed into the plate, and the plate was fastened into the
waterway by screws. There was a similar hole on the starboard side. The District Judge was of opinion that these
holes, which had never been used, were dangerous unless the
caps and plates to cover them were'kept perfectly tight and
secure; that "the obligation to keep watch of their condition
was as stringent as the danger from weakness in them was
extreme;" and that there was no satisfaotory evidence that
there had been more than a casual examination of them since
the schooner was built, some eleven years previous.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

The theory of the defence was that the plate and cap were
perfectly tight, bat that, through the many seas taken aboard,
they were knocked off by accident or by some blow from floating articles. The District Judge held that this was possible,
but for reasons, which he gave, that its probability was exceedingly small; and that even if it could be supposed that
the plate had been knocked off through the blow of some
object washed across the deck, it would still be incumbent on
the claimant to show that the cap and plate were so made and
fastened as not to be knocked off by ordinary collisions of that
kind, which had not been done; that while there could be
scarcely any doubt that the cap and plate were carried off
through the action of the sea, yet that the evidence indicated
clearly that this was done before the vessel was subjected to
any extraordinary conditions, aside from her deep loading,
and that there was no indication of any such violence about
the wood work in that quarter as would be necessary to knock
away such a cap if properly secured; and that the only reasonable conclusion was that after eleven years' service the fastenings had become weak, and that the plate had been carried
away from that cause, and not from any extraordinary contingencies.
The case having been taken to the Circuit Court, the testimony of one Candage, an expert, was given to the effect that
these bilge-pump plates in the waterways were regarded as
permanent fixtures not requiring to be removed for examination; that by taking hold of the cap one could judge of the
firmness of the plate; that he had sometimes unscrewed the
cap, but usually could judge of condition by the eye; that by
unscrewing one could judge of the condition of the wood
slightly better; that he never thought it necessary to unscrew
the plate, which, if done frequently, would have a tendency to
weaken the fastenings; that if the plate of the Morrison had
been there for ten or eleven years and never removed, and
had been painted over from time to time with the ways, no
examination was necessary other than by the eye; that he
would say as matter of opinion there would be no gradual
weakening of the fastenings of the plate; that upon the de-

Statement of the Case.

tails stated in a hypothetical question it was his opinion that
the loss of the bilge-pump plate was attributable to the fact
that some hard substance had been dashed against it by the
force of the waves and the rolling of the vessel, though the
force of the water alone could not have ripped it out and carried it away. The Circuit Judge was of opinion (40 Fed. Rep.
501) that "the vessel was not originally unseaworthy because
she had bilge-pump holes covered as these were. The presumption of. continuing seaworthiness in respect to this part
of the ship is not rebutted by the single fact that no special
test was mad as to their condition, in view of the testimony
(especially that taken in this court) as to what is the usual
examination given to such structures." And he concluded
that the inference to be drawn from the testimony was "that
there was no defect, patent, or latent ; that the fastenings
were sufficient, and were knocked out by a blow such as could
not reasonably have been anticipated, and which was caused
by a danger of the sea."
The Circuit Court made its findings of fact and conclusions
of law, which are given in the margin,1 (and to which, in
1 ,I. The schooner Edwin I. Morrison, owned by the claimants, was chartered on December 19, 1883, by a written charter party, to the libellant for
a voyage from Weymouth, Mlass., to Savannah, Ga., to carry a complete
cargo of guano in bags and (or) bulk for a price agreed upon.
"II. By the charter party it was agreed on the part of the vessel that
she ' should be tight, staunch, strong, and every way fitted for such a voyage,' and ' the dangers of the sea (were) mutually excepted.'
"III. Under this charter there was loaded on board said schooner by
the libellant a cargo of guano, superphosphate, and other fertilizers, viz.,
3431
tons in bulk and 410 1 tons in bags, besides 3925 empty bags and
sacks. Six bills of lading were given therefor, which acknowledged the
receipt of said cargo in good order and condition and agreed to deliver the
same in like good order and condition at Savannah, the dangers of the sea
only excepted. The bulk cargo was stowed between decks and the remainder in the lower hold.
"IV. The cargo was what is known as a ' dead cargo,' and a hard one
for a vessel to carry in severe weather.
" V. The vessel was not overloaded. She was accustomed to and able
to carry that amount of cargo of the same character at that season.
" VI. The vessel was built in 1873; had three masts; was about 155 feet
long over all, carrying spanker, mainsail, foresail, forestaysail, jib, flying

Statement of the Case.

whole or in part, and to certain refusals to find, libellant filed
twenty-seven exceptions,) and rendered a decree reversing the

-

jib, outer jib, fore-topsail, main-topsail, and mizzen-topsail. She was properly manned and equipped. Her officers and crew consisted of a master,
first mate, second mate, steward, and four sailors. On this voyage she had
two passengers on board, viz., the master's wife and a lady friend.
"VII. On the port side of the vessel, in the waterway, and close to the
bulwark, there was a hole about three inches in diameter, made when she
was built, for the purpose of introducing a hose-pipe into her bilges to
free her of any water accumulated there. The waterway (of yellow pine)
was about three and a half inches above the deck. The hole was a short
distance in front of the poop and ran down through the waterway, between the ceiling and the skin of the ship. The hole was covered by a
brass plate about four inches square, countersunk into the timber flush
with the top of the waterway and fastened by four brass screws. In the
brass plate was a removable cap, also of brass, intended to be unscrewed
from the plate when the hole was to be used, but it had not, in fact, been
used for four or five years (if, indeed, at all) and was painted over whenever the waterway was painted. The removable cap projected about threeeighths of an inch above the surface of the plate, the edges being bevelled
so as to leave not more than an eighth of an inch of perpendicular surface.
There was a similar plate and cap on the starboard side of the vessel, but
somewhat further aft and upon the poop deck.
" VIII. Such bilge-pump holes are not unusual in vessels constructed in
some localities. The plates are generally considered permanent fixtures,
not peculiarly susceptible to deterioration from age. Verdigris sometimes
forms around brass screws, thus weakening the hold of the wood; but
waterways located as this was, well covered up and well painted, are not
liable to rot, and their reasonable expectation of sound life is largely in
excess of twelve years.
"If the plates mnd caps which are generally used to cover such holes are
not kept tight and secure, the holes become dangerous; but that mode of
covering was generally deemed secure by seafaring men, and seldom, if
ever, have any accidents arisen from their use.
"IX. The bilge-pump hole, heretofore described as located in the waterway, was opposite a port in the bulwarks of the vessel. The opening of
the port was about a foot square, beginning about two inches from the
bulkhead of the poop deck. The poop deck was about four and a half feet
above the main deck, and extended from just about the mainmast to the
stern.
"X. Said bilge-pump plate was in plain view, upon a casual inspection,
at the time of making the charter and loading the vessel. The vessel was
loaded several times before this voyage by the libellant.
"XI. Before the vessel sailed the cap and plate appeared to be in good
order, with no indication of looseness. The examination which was at that

decree of the District Court, and dismissing the libel with

time made of them consisted of such inspection as could be given by the
eye, and to such an inspection they were from time to time subjected.
They were not tested either by unscrewing the cap or the plate, or by tapping the plate with a hammer. Tapping with a hammer or unscrewing the
cap might have developed any insecurity (if there were any) in the bilgepump plate. Immediately after the loss of the port-bilge plate (hereafter
described) the mate tested the condition of the similar plate on the poop
deck, starboard side, by tapping with a hammer, and found it apparently
sound.
"XII. The examination which was made of the cap and plate, as set
forth in the XIth finding (viz., by a survey without the use of special tests,
unless there is some appearance of defect,) is such as a reasonably prudent
master or owner might be expected to give them in order to determine the
seaworthiness of his vessel before beginning a voyage.
"XIII. The voyage began the 5th day of January, 1884, and the vessel
actually got to sea on the 7th, when she encountered a strong northwest gale.
The light sails were furled and the mainsail and foresail double-reefed. The
gale caused her to labor heavily and ship large quantities of water, some
of which entered the cabin and reached the cargo. The vessel was driven
out of her course and into the Gulf Stream. The gale moderated somewhat
the latter part of the day, but the vessel still continued to roll heavily and
shipped plenty of water. The pumps were attended to and the vessel was
found to be making considerable water. The next day the gale continued,
with a very heavy sea running, until about 4 P.-m., when it moderated, and
at 6 P.1. topsails were set. The latter part of the day there was a strong
breeze, and two reefs were made in the spanker. The vessel made little
water this day. The next day, the 9th, began with a strong southeast
breeze, which freshened to a strong gale. Two reefs were made in main
and foresails. At 4 r.. the spanker and jib were furled. The middle part
of the day there was a very sharp gale and heavy sea running. The vessel
labored heavily and shipped great quantities of water. The pumps were
carefully attended to, and she was found to be making considerable water.
The latter part of the day the wind was still increasing and the foresail and
the fore staysail were furled. It was then blowing a 'living' gale from the
westward. The weather through the night continued to be extremely
severe; there was a 'terrific gale of wind.' Planks were carried away
from the bulwarks of the starboard side of vessel, also one of the ports;
the waterway on starboard side was started off. The covers of the chain
locker and a spar were found loose in the morning, floating in the waist
of the vessel on both sides. Coal washed about decks; also buckets and
bucket racks; also pieces of bulwark. The forecastle door and galley door
were washed off, but were not lost. The men could not stand at pumps on
main deck because it was continually swept by the seas, and it was with

difficulty that they were able to work at the pump on the poop deck, which
was about four and a half feet higher than the main deck, on account of
the sea breaking over. Before midnight the vessel was hove to under a
storm trysail, two-reefed foresail, and fore staysail on the port tack. The
vessel was shipping water through the cabin windows, doors, and down the
booby hatch. The cabin was situated in the after part of the poop deck.
The top of the cabin house was about three and a half feet above the deck.
They commenced to take water in the cabin while eating supper, and all
through the night it forced its way in. This was unusual and indicated
very bad weather and a rough sea. Everything in the cabin was drenched,
excepting the berths, with water washing around the cabin with motion of
vessel. Water reached the cargo during the night through the cabin, a
strained waterway, and otherwise. The pumps were tried every two hours,
and by four o'clock Thursday morning it was discovered, by the pumps
bringing up guano with the water, that the cargo was wet. The master
of the vessel did not go to bed during the night, but was mostly on deck.
Previous to 4.30 o'clock in the morning they were able to get a suck on the
pumps, indicating that there was no water then in the well, but after that
they were unable to do so. At this time the weather was very bad, a very
bad sea flooding the decks continually and washing everything movable
about. About five o'clock they sounded and found eighteen inches of water
in the well. In about half an hour afterwards they wore ship, putting the
vessel before the wind, so that the men could stand at the pumps. This
gave the vessel a list to port. The only outlets on the port side for the
seas that came aboard were the open port above mentioned and the scuppers. They continued pumping, but still were unable to get a suck, and at
nine o'clock soundings showed about seven feet of water in the vessel.
Preparations were then made to abandon the vessel, as she was supposed to
be sinking. The lashings of the boat on the poop deck were cut and the
women on board came up from the cabin to take the boat. Between ten
and eleven o'clock they wore ship and the vessel slowly righted up, the
booms swinging from the port to the starboard side, bringing the port side
out of the water. The vessel was then working heavily in the sea, losing
steerage-way, and settling fast. When the vessel righted up and rolled her
lee side out of water, the second mate, who with others fastened with lines
to prevent them from being washed away, was working at the pump on
the main deck, heard a heavy gurgling sound, and let go the pump and
went over to the port side, put his hand against the rail, and looked down
under it to where the bilge-pump plate was, and saw a hole large enough to
put his hand in. He ran his hand and arm down the hole and sung out to
the captain, ' Look here !' Being greatly excited and not looking for such
a thing, he hardly realized what the trouble was. The captain came and

said, ' My God, this is the bilge pump! ' It was found that the whole bilgepump plate, with the screws, was gone.
"XIV. The wood to which the plate had been fastened looked white and
sound. From the holes out of which the screws had come part of the clear
wood was itself hauled, the splinters hanging around the edges of the holes,
the holes thus presenting a ragged look. The screw-holes were not smooth
nor black nor rusty. The wood of this particular waterway in the vicinity
of the plate did not look rotten, and when after arrival at Savannah the
temporary plugging referred to in the XVIIth finding was removed, and
the hole plugged and covered with sheet lead, the timber into which the
plug was driven and on which the lead was nailed was found solid, and
since that time the covering had not been further repaired nor the timber
changed in any way.
"XV. No marks of violence other than the splintering of the wood
about the screw-holes were visible upon the waterway or upon the adjacent
bulwarks or stanchions.
"X1VI. As no one witnessed the removal of the bilge-pump plate, direct
evidence of the cause of this mishap is not obtainable. It is, however, to
be inferred from the facts proved that it was knocked out by something
striking violently against it subsequently to the time when they wore ship
after finding eighteen inches of water in the well, which would be between
5 ... and 5.30 .i.,.
"X1VII. The hole was at once plugged up, covered with canvas, and
sheet lead nailed over the canvas.
"XVIII. At this time the wind had abated somewhat. The vessel's
wheel was tied hard up and the sails trimmed so that she would lie to, and
the crew went to work pumping again and gained on the water. By eleven
or twelve o'clock that night they succeeded in getting her free of water, so
far as the pumps could do so, and the journey was continued.
"XIX. Afterwards it was found that the mainmast had been loosened
by the working of the vessel, and that the coating was broken; also that
a scupper on the starboard side was broken.
"XX. The weather continued severe during almost the entire voyage
and the injury to the cargo was increased thereby.
"XXI. The vessel arrived in Savannah, January 27th.
"XXII. Upon the arrival she delivered her cargo, some of it in a damaged condition. The extent of the damage was e9175.40.
"XXIII. At the time of the contract and lading of cargo and commencement of voyage the vessel was tight, staunch, and strong, and in
every way fitted for the contemplated voyage.
"XXIV. There was no latent defect in the vessel which contributed
to the injury to the cargo.
"XXV. There was no fault or negligence in the navigation of the
vessel or care of the cargo.

OCTOBER TERI, 1893.
Argument for Appellee.

The argument made by appellant in its brief is a manifest
attempt to obtain in this court a review of the findings made
by the Circuit Judge under the act of 1875. The whole argument is such as would be appropriate before a court of original jurisdiction on the trial of the cause, but is clearly out
of place on this appeal. This court has repeatedly held that
under the act of 1875, it is only ultimate facts which the Circuit Court is bound to find, that refusals to find mere incidental facts, amounting only to evidence from which the
ultimate fact is to be obtained, will not be noticed; but that
if the Circuit Court refuses to make a finding, one way or the
other, as to a material fact established by uncontradicted evidence, or if it finds such a fact when not supported by any
evidence, this court will review the rulings, provided exceptions are properly taken, and the questions are presented by
bill of exceptions. The E. A. Packer, 140 U. S. 360; Tke

III. The circumstances under which the plate was lost
raised a presumption that it was caused by dangers of the seas.
Aside from the inferential finding of fact that the plate was
knocked out by something striking violently against it, the
same result would follow as a necessary conclusion from the
facts which were directly testified to and found.
Bilge-pump holes covered with such plates were not unusual,
and their reasonable expectation of sound life was largely in
excess of the age of this vessel. This mode of covering the
holes was generally deemed secure by seafaring mefi, and
seldom, if ever, had any accidents arisen from their use. The
District Judge found to the same effect.

not to the fault of the vessel.
" Second. The decree of the District Court is reversed and the libel dismissed with costs of both courts."

THE EDWIN I. MORRISON.
Opinion of the Court.

Before commencing this voyage the vessel had been examined in the usual manner, and the plate seemed to be in
good order. The examination made was such as a reasonably
prudent master or owner might be expected to give in order
to determine the seaworthiness of his vessel. At this time
she was tight, staunch, and strong, and in every way fitted
for the contemplated voyage.
Almost immediately after the commencement of the voyage,
she encountered a storm of unprecedented violence, from the
effect of which she took in eighteen inches of water which
came in contact with the cargo and soaked it to some extent
directly, and by capillary attraction.
While in this condition, the port then being the weather
side, she wore ship. Just before this time the weather was
very bad, a bad sea was flooding the decks continually and
washing everything movable about. The covers of the chain
locker and a spar were found loose in the morning, coal washed
about decks, also buckets, racks, pieces of bulwark, the forecastle door and the galley door. The wearing of the ship
gave her a list to port, and the only outlet on that side for
the seas and wreckage, excepting the scuppers, was the open
port opposite which the plate was located.
After she took in 5 or 6 feet more of water, the loss of the
plate was discovered, and we will assume arguendo that this
additional water was due to its loss.
It was then found that the wood where the plate was
fastened was sound, that the screws in coming out had hauled
part of the clear wood, leaving splinters hanging around the
edges of the holes, the holes thus presenting a ragged look.
The screw holes were not smooth, black, or rusty.
Under these circumstances the authorities fully sustain the
legal conclusion: "The damage is to be attributed to the
dangers of the seas and not the fault the vessel." The Rover,

delivered the opinion of the

OCTOBER TERAI, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

Assuming, as we must, that the damages awarded by the
District Court resulted from the loss of the cap and plate
covering the bilge-pump hole, the question to be determined is
whether that loss was occasioned by a peril of the sea or by
the condition of that covering as it was when the vessel
entered upon her voyage. If through some defect or weakness the plate and cap and the screws which secured it came
off, or if the cap and plate were so made or so fastened as to
be liable to be knocked off by any ordinary blows from objects
washed by the sea across the decks, then the vessel was not
seaworthy in that respect, and the loss could not be held to
come within the exception of perils of the sea, although the
vessel encountered adverse winds and heavy weather. By the
charter party it was agreed on the part of the vessel that she
should be tight, staunch, strong, and in every way fitted for
the voyage, and the rule is well settled that the charterer is
bound to see that his vessel is seaworthy and suitable for the
service for which she is to be employed, while no obligation
to look after the matter rests upon the owner of the cargo.

As said, on circuit, by Mr. Justice Gray, in The Caledonia,
43 Fed. Rep. 681, 685: "In every contract for the carriage of goods by sea, unless otherwise expressly stipulated,
there is a warranty on the part of the ship owner that the
ship is seaworthy at the time of beginning her voyage, and
not merely that he does not know her to be unseaworthy, or
that he has used his best efforts to make her seaworthy. The
warranty is absolute that the ship is, or shall be, in fact seaworthy at that time, and does not depend on his knowledge
or ignorance, his care or negligence." In The Glenfrui, 10
P. D. 103, 108, the same rule is thus expressed by Butt, J.:
"I have always understood the result of the cases from Lyon
v. Mells, 5 East, 429, to Kopitof v. Wilson, 1 Q. B. D. 377, to

owner contracts, not merely that he will do his best to make
the ship reasonably fit, but that she shall really be reasonably
fit for the voyage. Had those cases left any doubt in my
mind, it would h.ve been set at rest by the observations of
some of the peers in the opinions they delivered in the case
of Steel v. State Line Steamship Co., 3 App. Cas. 72."
Perils of the sea were excepted by the charter party, but
the burden of the proof was on the respondents to show that
the vessel was in good condition and suitable for the voyage
at its inception, and the exception did not exonerate them
from liability for loss or damage from one of those perils to
which their negligence, or that of their servants, contributed.
Liverpool Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 438.
It was for them to show affirmatively the safety of the cap
and plate; and that they were carried away by extraordinary
contingencies, not reasonably to have been anticipated. We
do not understand from the findings that the severity of the
weather encountered by the Morrison was anything more
than was to be expected upon a voyage, such as this, down
that coast and in the winter season, or that she was subjected
to any greater danger than a vessel so heavily loaded, and
with a hard cargo, might have anticipated under the circumstances. The especial peril which seemed at one time to
threaten her safety was directly attributable to the water
taken aboard through the uncovered bilge-pump hole, which
rose from eighteen inches about 5 A.M. to seven feet at about
9 A.M., so that she was necessarily sinking deeper and deeper,
while the absorption by the guano added to the dead weight,
and increased the danger of her going down.
Among other exceptions, libellant excepted to the refusal
to amend one of the findings by adding: "11 o spars nor sails
were carried away and no repairs were made to the vessel at
Savannah beyond nailing a few boards on the starboard side
where the bulwarks had been broken, which was done by the
crew; and the vessel, after discharging, loaded with a cargo
of phosphate rock, which is a much harder cargo to carry
than guano, and delivered it safely." These facts were established in substance by uncontradicted evidence, and as they

Opinion of the Court.

tended to show that the schooner was not injured to any
appreciable degree, and therefore that the weather was not of
such an extraordinary character as would have damaged the
cargo to the extent that it was if the vesselo had been seaworthy in the respect under consideration, we think the amendment was material, and should in effect have been made.
What happened to the vessel after the loss of the bilge-pump
plate throws but little, if any, light upon the situation at the
time of the loss; and libellant excepted to parts of the thirteenth finding so far as they involved the inference that certain incidents therein detailed occurred before the cap and
plate came off, as unsupported by evidence; and also to that
part of the sixteenth finding which stated that it was to be
inferred that the plate was knocked out "subsequently to the
time when they wore ship after finding eighteen inches of
water in the hold" on the same ground. But without going
into these details or inquiring how far they are open to examination, the significant fact is found that although at half-past
four in the morning the pumps sucked, indicating that there
was then no water in the well, they did not suck (twenty
minutes later, as disclosed by the evidence, nor) again until
the hole was discovered and stopped up, when they gained on
the water, and after several hours freed the vessel.
In any aspect, the real point in controversy is, did the respondents so far sustain the burden of proof which was upon
them as to render the probability that the cap and plate were
in good condition and knocked off through extraordinary
contingencies so strong as to overcome the inference that
they were not in condition to withstand the stress to which
on such a voyage it might reasonably have been expected they
would have been subjected? If the determination of this question is left in doubt, that doubt must be resolved against them.
The 8th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th, and 16th findings were as
follows:
"VIII. Such bilge-pump holes are not unusual in vessels
constructed in some localities. The plates are generally considered permanent fixtures, not peculiarly susceptible to deterioration from age. Verdigris sometimes forms around

Opinion of the Court.

brass screws, thus weakening the hold of the wood; but
waterways located as this was,. well covered up and well
painted, are not liable to rot, and their reasonable expectation
of sound life is largely in excess of twelve years.
"If the plates and caps which are generally used to cover
such holes are not kept tight and secure, the holes become
dangerous; but that mode of covering was generally deemed
secure by seafaring men, and seldom, if ever, have any accidents arisen from their use.
"XI. Before the vessel sailed the cap and plate appeared
to be in good order, with no indication of looseness. The
examination which was at that time made of them consisted of
such inspection as could be given by the eye, and to such an
inspection they were from time to time subjected. They were
not tested either by unscrewing the cap or the plate, or by
tapping the plate with a hammer. Tapping with a hammer
or unscrewing the cap might have developed any insecurity
(if there were any) in the bilge-pump plate. Immediately
after the loss of the port-bilge plate (hereafter described) the
mate tested the condition of the similar plate on the poop
deck, starboard side, by tapping with a hammer, and found it
apparently sound.
"XII. The examination which was made of the cap and
plate, as set forth in the XIth finding (viz., by a survey without the use of special tests, unless there is some appearance
of defect) is such as a reasonably prudent master or owner
might be expected to give them in order to determine the
seaworthiness of his vessel before beginning a voyage.
"XIV. The wood to which the plate had been fastened
looked white and sound. From the holes out of which the
screws had come part of the clear wood was itself hauled, the
splinters hanging around the edges of the holes, the holes thus
presenting a ragged look. The screw-holes were not smooth
nor black nor rusty. The wood of this particular waterway
in the vicinity of the plate did not look rotten, and when after
arrival at Savannah the temporary plugging referred to in
the XVIIth finding was removed, and the hole plugged and
covered with sheet lead, the timber into which the plug was

Opinion of the Court.

driven and on which the lead was nailed was found solid, and
since that time the covering had not been further repaired nor
the timber changed in any way.
"XV. No marks of violence other than the splintering of
the wood about the screw-holes were visible upon the waterway or upon the adjacent bulwarks or stanchions.
"XVI. As no one witnessed the removal of the bilge-pump
plate, direct evidence of the cause of this mishap is not obtainable. It is, however, to be inferred from the facts proved that
it was knocked out by something striking violently against it
subsequently to the time when they wore ship after finding
eighteen inches of water in the well, which would be between
5 A.m. and 5.30 A.m."
There was no direct evidence that the plate was knocked
out, or, if this were so, that it was by some extraordinary collision; and while the fourteenth finding tends to support the
inference of the sixteenth, it will be observed that the tendency
of the fifteenth is to rebut it. If it appeared that the wood
was solid, and the screw-holes splintered, the drawing out of
the screws might be imputed to a blow or blows; but, on the
other hand, if there were no marks of violence in the vicinity,
since such blow or blows to effect the result, if the cap, plate
and waterway were in good condition, must necessarily have
been of great violence, it seems almost incredible that no
marks thereof appeared on the stanchions and bulwarks on
the port side, and that nothing but the cap and plate were
carried away. And it is proper to note that no survey of the
vessel was had, and that respondents introduced no proof of
exact measurements to show the height of the cap above the
waterway, or of the perpendicular edge, nor was the duplicate
cap on the starboard side produced.
If, however, the vessel had been so inspected as to establish
her seaworthiness when she entered upon her voyage, then
upon the presumption that that seaworthiness continued the
conclusion reached might follow, but we are of opinion that
precisely here respondents failed in their case.
From the sixth and seventh findings it appears that the vessel was built in 1873; that the bilge-pump hole had not been

THE EDWIN I. MORRISON.
Opinion of the Court.

used for four or five years, if at all; and that the cap and
plate were painted over whenever the waterway was painted;
and from the findings above quoted that these holes were dangerous unless the caps and plates were kept tight and secure;
that the hold of the wood might become weakened by the
formation of verdigris about the brass screws; that tapping
with a hammer or unscrewing the cap might have developed
any insecurity, if there were any; that no such tests were applied; but that the caps and plates appeared all right to visual
observation. But this was not enough to establish the fact of
security; and the twelfth finding, that examination by the
eye is such as a reasonably prudent master or owner might be
expected to give such coverings in order to determine their
seaworthiness, does not give it that effect. The obligation
rested on the owners to make such inspection as would ascertain that the caps and plates were secure. Their warranty
that the vessel was seaworthy in fact "did not depend on
their knowledge or ignorance, their care or negligence." The
burden was upon them to show seaworthiness, and if they did
not do so, they failed to sustain that burden, even though
owners are in the habit of not using the precautions which
would deinonstrate the fact. In relying upon external appearances in place of known tests, respondents took the risk
of their inability to satisfactorily prove the safety of the cap
and plate if loss occurred through their displacement.
We are unwilling, by approving resort to mere conjecture as
to the cause of the disappearance of this cap and plate, to relax
the important and salutary rule in respect of seaworthiness.

The findings that "at the time of the contract and lading
of cargo and commencement of voyage the vessel was tight,
staunch, and strong, and in every way fitted for the contemplated voyage;" that "there was no latent defect in the vessel which contributed to the injury to the cargo;" and that
"the whole of said damage to cargo was caused by a danger
of the seas, and was within the exception in charter party and

STATES FOR THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 266. Argued March 12, 13, 1894. -Decided April 30, 1894.

A contract for a loan and water works in Havana having been awarded to
R., G., L. and M., a deposit was required as a guarantee. N. was employed by R. to raise the money. He borrowed it from B. R. became
the assignee of the interests of his co-contractors, and then failed to
perform the contract. In order to procure a general release from the
liabilities arising from such failure, he gave a power of attorney to Q.,
who thereupon, in his name and as attorney in fact, entered into an
agreement in writing with B. by which it was, among other things,
agreed that R. should pay to B. an agreed balance of $19,087.36 in three
months from date, with interest at 9 per cent. That sum not being paid
when due, B. sued R. to recover it. Held,
(1) That the power granted by R. to Q. was outstanding when the agreement was executed;
(2) That the agreement made by Q. with B. was authorized by the
power;
