GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 253. Argued March 8,1894. -Decided May 14,1894.
The claims covered by letters patent No. 56,793, issued July 31, 1866, to
Henry Pearce for "a new and useful machine for crushing and pulverizing quartz-rock, stone, and any description of ores," were not infringed
by the machine made by the defendants, and were, in some respects, anticipated by the invention patented to Jonathan F. Ostrander by letters
patent No. 4478, dated April 25, 1846; by the invention patented to George
H. Wood by letters patent No. 28,031, dated April 24, 1860; and by the
invention patented to James W. Rutter by reissued letters patent No.
3633, dated September 7, 1869.
The invention patented to Charles M. Brown by letters patent No. 201,646,
dated Mlarch 26, 1878, for "a new and useful improvement in ore-crushers," was in its general features a reproduction of the machine patented
to James W. Rutter by reissued letters patent No. 3633, dated September
7, 1869; and, in view of the prior patents to Rutter and Tripp, must
receive a narrow construction, which frees the defendants from the
charge of infringing them.
The invention patented to George Raymond and Albert Raymond by letters
patent No. 237,320, dated February 1, 1881, for "improvements in grinding mills," was for a combination which included several features not
found in the machines made by the defendants.
The function of the safety pin in letters patent No. 110,397, issued to John
H. Rusk, December 20, 1870, and antedated December 9, 1870, is practically the same as that of the pin in the combination patented to George
and Albert Raymond.
The claim in letters patent No. 243,343, issued June 21, 1881, to Philetus W.
Gates for the segmental cast-bearing for the ball of the socket joint,
having a form which gives it a bearing contact upon the ball, was anticipated by machines constructed by Charles M. Brown and in public use
more than two years before Gates applied for his patent.
The claim in letters patent No. 243,545, issued June 28, 1881, to Philetus W.
Gates for a novel application of a loose collar .around the eccentrically
gyrating shaft to prevent dirt from getting into the bearing, was anticipated in the Brown machine, as changed in 1878, by a circular washer
or collar upon the top of the sleeve that surrounded the breaking head,
which fitted around the shaft.
The invention patented to Philetus W. Gates by letters patent No. 246,608,
dated September 6, 1881, viz., a device for a depression or groove in the
outer bearing surface of the bearing-box, and applying within this de-

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Statement of the Case.
pression a removable portion of carbon-bronze metal, so as to correct
the wear of the machine at that place, is void for want of patentable
invention.
The alleged invention in letters patent No. 250,656, issued December 13,
1881, to Philetus W. Gates, is for a combination of old features, viz., a
shaft, a bearing for the shaft, a hard metal plate in the lower end of the
shaft, an adjustable sliding step block, an oil step box, and a hard metal
plate at the end of the shaft, allof which, except the metal plate, were
present in the Brown machine as made and sold more than -two years
before Gates applied for the patent; and the metal plate was old and in
use for the same purpose as in Gates's machine long before his application.
The use of safety pins for saving machinery from the strain of a sudden
jar did not involve patentable invention.
A verbal assignment of an interest in letters patent is held to have no force
or effect against a subsequent assignee claiming under a formal written
transfer, and having no knowledge of the previous verbal transfer.

AT the March term, 1890, of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Northern District of Illinois the Gates Iron
Works, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Illinois, filed its bill of complaint against David R. Fraser,
Thomas Chalmers, and iiram H. Scoville, alleging that the
said complainant was the sole owner of several letters patent
of the United States, namely, No. 56,793, issued to Henry
Pearce, July 31, 1866; No. 201,646, issued to Charles Al.
Brown, March 26, 1878; No. 237,320, issued to George and
Albert Raymond, February 1, 1881; No. 110,397, issued to
John H. Rusk, December 20, 1870; No. 243,343, issued to
P. W. Gates, June 21, 1881; No. 243,545, issued to P. W.
Gates, June 28, 1881; No. 246,608, issued to P. W. Gates,
September 6, 1881 ; and No. 250,656, issued to P. W. Gates,
December 13, 1881; and which said letters patent, and the
inventions and improvements therein described, had, by
assignments in writing, prior to the commencement of the
suit, become vested in the complainant. The bill further
alleged that the defendants were making, using, and vending
machines embodying the said inventions, in disregard of the
rights of complainant, and prayed for the usual relief.
The defendants filed a joint and several answer, admitting
that the letters patent mentioned in the bill had been issued,

OCTOBER TERIM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

but denying that the persons to whom they had been granted
were the original and first inventors of the several inventions
described and claimed therein, or that the defendants had
infringed, or were infringing, the rights of the complainant in
the said inventions.
The answer further averred that the defendant Hiram H.
Scoville had, prior to the filing of the application by Charles
:M. Brown for a patent for the improvements described and
claimed in said patent No. 201,646, dated March 26, 1878, by
and with the consent of the said Brown, made and put into
use two machines containing the inventions secured by said
patent No. 201,646, and that the defendants had a right to
make and sell machines containing said inventions by virtue
of an oral license given by Brown to Scoville before the
application for said patent was filed.
The answer further alleged that P. W. Gates was not the
original and first inventor of the improvements described in
the several patents Nos. 243,343, 243,545, 246,608, 250,656;
but that substantially those improvements were invented by
said Charles M. Brown before the supposed invention thereof
by Gates, and were embodied and exemplified in certain fullsized working machines built by the said Hiram H. Scoville,
w'hich were publicly used more than two years before Gates
made application for any one of the said four patents.
The answer further stated that Henry Pearce was not the
original and first inventor of the improvement patented by
said patent No. 56,793, dated July 31, 1866, and that substantially the same thing was shown and described in letters patent
No. 28,031, issued to one G. H. Wood, dated April 24, 1860.
Subsequently the defendants, with leave of court, filed the
following amendment to the answer, to wit:
"Letters patent to J. F. Ostrander, granted and dated
April 25,.1846, No. 4478, 'grain mill.'
"And as to the patent mentioned in said bill of complaint
as having been granted and issued to J. H. Rusk, Charles M.
Brown, G. and A. Raymond, and the four patents to P. W.
Gates, numbered respectively 243,343, 243,545, 246,608, and
250,656, they further aver, upon information and belief, that

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE

SHIRAS,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The patents that are before us for consideration are for improvements in stone-crushing machines. We shall preface our
discussion of the questions that arise by adopting from the
brief of the plaintiff in error the following description of the
final and perfected form of the machine, and which is claimed
to embody the various inventions and improvements covered
by the several patents:
"The inventions of these various patents can be more readily understood by first understanding the construction of this
type of stone-crushing machines which has become to be
known as the gyratory type of stone crushers. This name
comes from the fact that the crushing cone is carried on a
vertical shaft which has its bearing at one end in the axis of
the conical enclosing case which surrounds the crushing cone,
while the bearing of the other end of the cone shaft is eccentric to the axis of the enclosing or surrounding conical cylinder which surrounds the crushing cone. This vertical shaft
which carries the crushing cone of the machine is loose in its
bearings, but the end of this shaft which is eccentric to the
axis of the enclosing conical case or cylinder of the machine is
carried around in a circle by being placed in an eccentric box
in a gear wheel that is revolved on its centre, which centre is
in the axis of the enclosing case or cylinder of the machine.
The shaft which carries the crushing cone describes in its
movement, when the machine is in operation, a conical orbit
around the vertical axis of the enclosing conical cylinder of
the machine. The stone to be crushed is dumped into the top
of the machine between the crushing cone and the cylindrical
conical case or shell which surrounds it, the cone shaft is
carried around in its conical orbit, the crushing cone impinges the ore or rock between it and the surrounding case or
cylinder, and crushes it. The shaft or arbor of this crushing
cone being loose in its bearings, it does not rub or grind the
stone, but simply cracks it into finer pieces, and then impinges
the next pieces of ore or rock, and so on around the entire
VOL. cLm-22

Opinion of the Court.

conical orbit, the space between the crushing cone and the
enclosing conical case or cylinder opposite of where the ore or
rock is being cracked or broken becomes greater by reason of
the crushing cone being carried to the opposite side of the
enclosing case or cylinder, and the broken rock falls down into
a narrower space, and when the crushing cone comes around
again- it is again broken, until it is sufficiently fine to pass out
at the bottom of the space between the crushing cone and its
enclosing case or cylinder.
"This construction of ore crushers, or stone breakers, as
they are frequently called, is a continuous feed machine, the
stone being constantly fed in at the top of the machine in
a coarse state, and continuously passes out at the bottom of
the crushing space, broken to a certain definite size, which is
fixed by an adjustment of the crushing cone in the enclosing
case or cylinder."
This form of machine is illustrated in the following drawing:

Vertical Sectional View of Machine.

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Opinion of the Court.

In this cut A represents the conical enclosing case or
cylinder which surrounds the crushing cone B, which is rigidly
attached to and is carried on the vertical shaft or arbor 0.
The top or upper end of the arbor 0 has a bearing in the
chilled section box D that is held in an open spider-frame E,
this bearing being exactly in line of the axis of the enclosing
conical case or cylinder A. The bottom or lower end of the
shaft C has its bearing in what is termed an eccentric box, F,
which is placed in the gear wheel G. This eccentric box is
placed at one side of or eccentric to the vertical axis of the
enclosing case or cylinder A. The gear wheel G is supported
on the base of the machine, so that the centre of its hub is
exactly in line with the vertical axis of the enclosing conical
case or cylinder A, and when it is revolved it carries the lower
end of the shaft or arbor C, around in a circle, and consequently continually brings the conical crushing cone B in
closer proximity to one side of the enclosing case or cylinder
to impinge the stone contained in the enclosing case or
cylinder, and that impingement is continually changing from
one place to another throughout the entire circle, and the
space opposite of the place of impingement between the crushing cone and its enclosing case or cylinder is wider than where
the impingement of the ore or stone is taking place. This particular motion of the crushing cone and its shaft or arbor has
been termed a gyratory motion. The shaft or arbor is never
vertical, and one of its bearings is in an eccentric box placed
eccentric to the bearing of the other end of the shaft or arbor,
and eccentric to the axis of the enclosing case or cylinder.
The crushing cone and its shaft or arbor describes at each
revolution of the geared wheel in which the eccentric box of
the shaft or arbor is placed, a conical orbit.
It is claimed by the plaintiff in error that this form of
machine is the composite result of the application of the improvements described in the patents set up in the bill. To test
the soundness of this claim it will be necessary for us to look
into the condition of the art prior to the issue of the earliest
patent owned by the complainant, that is, prior to July 31, 1866,
the date of letters patent No. 56,793, granted to Henry Pearce.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

The first patent to which our attention has been particularly
directed is that issued April 25, 1846, to Jonathan F. Ostrander, and numbered 44'78. It is a claim for an improvement in
grinding mills, and the nature of the invention is said to consist in "making the surfaces of the stones, or metallic plates,
between which the material is ground, the one convex, the
other concave, . . . and also in giving the movable plate
or stone a compound motion, consisting of, firstly, an oblique
gyrating motion of its axis around the axis of the fixed plate;
and, secondly, a rotating motion around its own axis." The
material to be ground is fed to the mill by being placed in a
cup-shaped opening in the top of the shell that encloses the
machine, and the ground material is received in a gutter surrounding the base. We here perceive the double motion, that
is, "the revolving and rolling motion," which is a feature of
the Pearce patent, and the operation of the two machines is
similar in that, in both, the pestle alternately closes upon and
recedes from the sides of the outer shell, so that any substance
or material to be ground is thereby crushed, aiid passes downward to the lower part of the machine, where the space gradually lessens, and is crushed finer.
The patent No. 28,031, granted April 21, 1860, to George
H. Wood, was for a machine for crushing stone, quartz, ores,
or any other substance capable of being reduced or pulverized
by pressure. The specification describes a machine having an
outer shell or case and an interior cone or pestle, which has
an eccentric motion. We shall hereafter show that the machine made by the defendants does not contain the distinguishing features of the Pearce patent. But we have briefly
described the inventions of Ostrander and of Wood to make
it to appear that machines composed of an outer shell or case
enclosing an outer cone or pestle, and operating on the material to be crushed by an eccentric motion, were known to the
art.
Letters patent No. 88,216, dated March 23, 1869, reissue
No. 3633, dated September 7, 1869, were granted to James
W. Rutter for an improvement in ore crushers, and in which
it is stated that the invention related to that class of crushing

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Opinion of the Court.

and grinding machines in which a conical grinder or crusher,
with concentric and eccentric bearings, is operated within a
stationary upright cylinder or chamber, or in which the crushing chamber is made conical and the crusher straight. There
are other special features contained in this patent not relevant
to our present inquiry, but this patent does provide for grinding ore or other material introduced at the upper or top end
of the machine, and subjecting it to a continuous crushing and
grinding force till it reaches the bottom, where it is discharged
into a gutter or annular space.
With this brief view of the state of the art we shall now examine the letters patent upon which the complainant directly
relies. The first is that which was granted to Charles Mt.
Brown, No. 201,646, dated March 26, 18T8.
The object of this invention is described as being "to furnish
a strong, compact machine, in which large pieces of ore may
be broken into smaller fragments by the regular continuous
movements of the mechanism, and also in which the power
used for crushing the ore shall be applied in a more advantageous manner than has been done heretofore in machines
designed for this purpose."
The specification describes a machine composed of an outer
shell or case, with an opening on one side for the egress of the
crushed ore. Within this outer shell is an upright shaft or
spindle, whose upper end is pivoted within a circular cap or
cover, which is accurately fitted within the top of the outer
shell. The lower end of the shaft is pivoted in a bearing
in the hub of a bevel gear, and this bearing is placed in an
eccentric position with reference to the centre of the hub.
The end of the shaft rests on a loose plate or button, which
is raised or lowered by an adjusting screw, which passes
through the lower part of the hub in a line with the axis of
the shaft. The upper part of the shaft, below the place where
it is pivoted in the cap, is contracted into a neck, and below
this neck it is enlarged in the form of a pyramidal section, so
as to receive a conical breaking head, which is accurately fitted
on the shaft. The outer shell or case is lined with a hard or
durable material, made in sections so that they may be readily

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

replaced by similar pieces when they are worn out by use, and
their wearing surfaces may be either smooth or corrugated.
The ore is fed into the machine through openings in the head,
and falls into the space between the outer shell, lined as before
mentioned, and the breaking head. When the driving mechanism, which is not claimed as a part of the invention, is set
in operation, the brekking head receives an eccentric gyratory
motion from the eccentrically-placed bearing in the hub of
the gear below, and advances successively towards every portion of the outer shell, crushing the ore that is contained between these two surfaces. As the breaking head advances on
one side it recedes on the opposite, thus allowing the partially
broken ore to fall still lower in the space between the shell
and the breaking head, to be again and again acted upon until
it is reduced to fragments sufficiently small to pass through an
opening at the bottom of the chamber. Here it falls upon an
inclined plate and passes out of the machine through the opening in the side of the shell. The claims of the inventor were
substantially for the combination of the gyrating spindle; the
conical breaking head with the breaking interior surface of
the shell; the sliding socket bearing in which the upper end
of the shaft operates; the eccentric bearing at the lower end
of the shaft, and the adjusting screw which raises or lowers
the shaft. His fourth claim was as follows: "In our orebreaking machine, a shell or case frame, enclosing at its upper
part a concave breaker, and provided with an oblique trough,
integral with the frame, the inner edge of which extends upwards and within the concave base of the breaker all around,
and having a low-down discharge at one side."
It will be seen that, in its general features, this machine is
a reproduction of that of Rutter. In both we find the outer
shell; the shaft to which a gyrating motion is given by the
eccentric bearing at the lower end, and which shaft works at
the upper end in a ball and socket joint, and the crusher or
breaking head of a conical form. The operation of the machines is similar in that the material to be crushed is fed into
the machine at the top, and passes down between the inner
surface of the shell and the breaker, and the gyrating motion

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Opinion of the Court.

of the shaft causes the breaking head to so operate that, as it
approaches the shell on the one side it departs from the other
side, thus permitting the partially broken ore to fall further
down in the chamber, and thus to be exposed over and again
to the crushing operation of the breaking head. It is true,
however, that the Rutter machine operates differently from
that of Brown's, because its crusher or breaking head does not
revolve on its own axis. There are also some minor features
in which the machines differ, but such minor features of the
Brown machine are not found in the defendant's machine.
The next patent, in chronological order, set up in the bill,
is that numbered 237,320, granted February 1, 1881, to George
Raymond and Albert Raymond. It claims to cover certain
improvements in that class of mills in which vertical metallic
grinding disks are employed, and the invention is said to consist in "the combination of the driving shaft, grinding or reducing devices having an exposed hub or bearing, and a safety
pin connecting said parts, and in minor details."
As the claims in this patent are for a combination which
includes several features not found in the machine as made by
the defendants, we need not dwell upon it further than to
observe that among the devices described is that of a "safety
pin," made of wood, which connects the rotary disk with the
shaft, and the object of which is to relieve the strain or
wrench which is sometimes given to the machine by some
stone or metal of a hardness too great to yield to the crushing
operation. The pin, which is strong enough to hold the rotary
disk in its connection with its shaft when the material is capable of being crushed, breaks when a refractory substance is
suddenly encountered, and thus permits the disk to stop, while
the shaft is permitted to continue its motion. The offending
substance is then removed, and the broken pin is removed and
replaced by a new one. We shall have occasion to revert to
this safety pin when we reach the question of infringement.
But in this connection we may briefly refer to the patent
No. 110,397, issued to John H. Rusk, December 20, 1870, and
which is also set up in the bill. The feature of this patent
which concerns our inquiry is the use of safety pins, whose

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

function is the same with that of the Raymond patent, with

the difference that the Rusk pins are made of soft metal,
strong enough to hold the driving shaft and the spindle together in all ordinary "grinding operations, but weak enough
to yield when any extraordinary strain is put on the machine
by the accidental introduction of a substance too bard to be
crushed. Another difference is that, in the Rusk machine,
the pins are placed between the two driving gear wheels,
which it is necessary to remove in order to get at the safety
pins to remove them or replace them, while, in the Raymond
machine, the safety pins are placed in an accessible position,
so that they can be removed without disturbing other parts
of the machine.
Continuing our history of the complainant's machines, we
come now to No. 243,343, issued to P. W. Gates, June 21,
1881. It is for an alleged improvement for ball joints of
stone breakers and other machines, and consists mainly in
constructing bearings in which the ball works so hardened
or chilled on the internal surface of the bearing as to offer
but slight friction to the ball which fits and works within it.
Further reference will be had to this patent when we treat
the question of infringement.
We next come to No. 243,545, issued to P. W. Gates, June
28, 1881. The specification, in terms, refers to letters patent
No. 201,646, issued March 26, 1878, to Charles M. Brown, and
claims for certain improvements to the Brown machine. The
machine as a whole is a reproduction of the main features
contained in the Brown and Rutter machines, but exhibits
some changes and improvements in details, to which we shall
hereafter refer.
On September 6, 1881, letters patent No. 246,608 were
granted to P. W. Gates, and are fiow the property of the
complainant company. This is a claim for an improvement in
eccentric revolving bearing boxes for ore crushers and stone
breakers. The inventor, in his specification, says: "My invention relates especially to the revolving eccentric bearing
box employed at the lower end of the gyrating shaft of stone
breakers and ore crushers, and the nature of my invention

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Opinion of the Court.

consists in providing the thicker or eccentric portion of said
bearing box with a depression or groove in its outer bearing
surface, and applying within this depression a removable portion of carbon bronze metal or other suitable durable wearing
metal, said removable portion of metal being of a segmental
form and extending partly around the circumference of the
eccentric bearing box proper, and also extending vertically
from or nearly from the upper to the lower ends of said
box proper, and being adapted for being secured in position
by bevel flanges at the edges of the depression or groove, or by
other suitable means provided on the bearing box proper, and
on the removable portion of metal or by said flanges, together
with screws or dowels. It also consists in the combination
of the box proper, having a peculiarly formed depression or
groove in its periphery, and a peculiarly formed removable
carbon bronze metal or other suitable bearing metal portion
whereby greater strength in the parts is secured." The practical necessity for this improvement is said to arise out of the
fact that there is a destructive wear on the periphery of the
bearing box, especially at the place where the box is made
with an increased thickness opposite one side of its eccentric
bore. In practice, it is said that this wear operates to
change the throw or motion of the eccentric, thus impairing
the effective capacity of the machine, and it is claimed that
this defect is remedied by the use of the removable bronze
metal. When the wear becomes so great as to injure the
operation of the machine, the bronze can be removed and
another portion of bronze metal put in its place, and thus dispense with procuring a new eccentric box.
Still another improvement was patented by P. W. Gates
by letters issued December 13, 1881, and numbered 250,656.
This invention relates to alleged improvements in the shaft of
ore-crushing machines, and in the method of applying oil to
the machinery while in place and in motion, and calls for no
special attention at this stage of our inquiry.
The defendants' machine, as described by W. S. Bates, an
expert called on behalf of the defendants, has an outer shell
or case; a crushing cone within the shell, mounted on a

shaft; a fixed bearing for the upper part of the shaft; an
eccentric bearing for the lower part of the shaft, by which it
is made to travel in a circular path; a step bearing for the
lower end of the shaft to take the thrust due to the weight
and the crushing effort, and suitable gearing operating on the
eccentric bearing to revolve the same.
The stress of the case is in the effort of the complainant's
witnesses to establish an infringement in the defendants'
machine of the Pearce patent and of the Rusk patent.
Undoubtedly, the leading features of the Pearce machine
are found in that of the defendants. There are the conical
shell or case; a conical crusher within the shell; a shaft on
which the crusher is secured; a pivotal point at the lower
end of the shaft, and an eccentric bearing at the upper end of
the shaft, whereby the shaft and the crushing cone are caused to
revolve in a conical orbit. But, as we have heretofore seen,
these are present in the Wood machine, a prior invention.
The Wood patent shows a stone-crushing mill consisting of a
conical shell, a conical crusher within the shell, a shaft on
which the crusher is mounted, a fixed pivotal point at the
lower end of the shaft, and the crusher revolves in a conical
orbit. The mode of operation is the same in the two patents
-that is, the material to be crushed is fed into the top of the
machine, the sides of the crushing cone are caused to approach and recede from the sides of the shell, so as to crush
the material, the motion being greatest at the top, where the
large lumps are, and least at the bottom, so that the material
is finely reduced, and passes, out at the bottom. The modes
of supporting and adjusting the crushing head and shaft are
mechanically different. Some of these principal features are
likewise to be seen in the Ostrander machine under a still
older patent.
The infringement of the IRusk patent is said to be in the use
in the defendants' machine of the safety break pins; and it
must be conceded that the defendants do use such a device.
Rusk does not claim the invention of the pin. What he does
claim is "the combination of soft-metal pins or plugs with the
driving gear of a grinding mill."

GATES IRON WORKS v. FRASER.
Opinion of the Court.

Hiram H. Scoville, one of the defendants' witnesses, testified that the use of breaking pins was common in large
machines; in a brick machine as far back as 1860; in the
Blake ore crusher in the form of a breaking link; and in
machines used in the shop of the witness in 1875.
Bates, defendants' expert, testified that "there is nothing
new in the use of such safety devices for such a purpose.
Their use is common in all classes of machines which are liable
to sudden or unexpected strains. I have here two examples
of safety pins applied to cultivators, to wit: patent No. 11,379
to G. Lichtenthaler, July 25, 1854, and patent INo. 75,669 to
J. D. De Turk, March 17, 1868. Both of these patents show
cultivator teeth, arranged with wooden pins, for the purpose
of having the pins break should the teeth strike a root or
stone, the object being to prevent the breaking of the
machine."
We do not perceive that this testimony was controverted by
the complainant's witnesses. The complainant's expert does
indeed claim that the patents referred to as showing the prior
use of safety pins do not show such use in combination with
driving gear. But, assuming that the use of safety pins for
saving machinery from the strain of a sudden jar was old, we
cannot regard their use, for such a purpose, in connection with
the driving gear of a stone-crushing machine, as patentable.
It is also to be observed that Rusk expressly limited himself
to a soft-metal pin, and thus limited, the use of wooden pins
being old, no infringement would be shown by defendants' use
of a hard cast-iron pin.
Coming now to the Brown patent, and not regarding, at
this stage of the discussion, the defendants' claim of a license,
we have to consider the claim of infringement. The claims
asserted are the 2d, 3d, and 4th. There is no pretence of infringement of the 1st claim, for the reason that the defendants' machine does not have the adjusting screw, the main
feature of that claim.
A comparison of the Brown patent, in the particulars relied
on, with the prior Rutter and Tripp patents, satisfies us that,
even if some of his additional devices were deemed novel, it is

plain, from the history of such machines, that his claims, to be
saved, must receive a very narrow construction. Thus limited,
they are not infringed in defendants' machines. We dismiss
this part of the case by adopting the views of the court below:
"Claims 2, 3, and 4 of the Brown patent are involved in this
suit. The fourth claim is limited to a shell enclosing at its
upper end a concave breaker, and provided with an oblique
trough 'integral with the frame, the inner edge of which
extends upwards and within the concave base of the breaker 6
all around.' This claim was allowed on the ground that this
feature of the combination was an improvement on anything
contained in the prior art. One element in the combination
covered by the second claim is the 'breaking head 6, constructed with a concave base as shown.' Both the drawing
and the specification show a concave breaking head, into
which the shell or trough extends. The trough or shell is
cast integral with the case shell. These claims cannot be
broadened by eliminating or disregarding any of their language. The breaking head of the defendants' machine is not
concave, and it follows that their machine has no trough
extending upward and within the con,%ve breaking head.
The defendants' machine, therefore, infringes neither the
second nor the fourth clain of the Brown patent. The defendants' machine does not contain the spindles with the
sliding bearing mentioned in Brown's third claim, or any
other sliding bearings, and the adjusting screw or step embraced in the third claim is not found in the defendants'
machine."
The defendants, in the fifth paragraph of their answer, aver
that, 'prior to Brown's application for patent No. 201,646,
H. H=.Scoville, one of the defendants, by and with Brown's
consent, made and put into use two machines containing the
invention described in that patent, and that by virtue of an
oral license thus given by Brown to Scoville the defendants
have a right to make and sell machines containing inventions
covered by said patent. Scoville testifies that, in consideration of assistance given by him to Brown in bringing out his
invention, the latter had verbally agreed that he, Scoville,

was to have a half interest in the exclusive manufacture of
the ore breakers, but that Brown had never made an assignment of such interest in a legal form. Brown himself testifies to the same effect. But, as it appears that subsequently
Brown assigned these letters patent to the complainant company, and as there is nothing to show that the latter had any
notice or knowledge of Scoville's interest, we think that no
effect can be given to tiais alleged verbal license or interest.
In the sixth paragraph of their answer the defendants
allege that, before P. W. Gates made application for either
one of the four patents issued to him, the same improvements
that were described in the Gates patent were known to and
used by Brown and Scoville; that said improvements were
invented by Brown, and were embodied by Scoville in fullsized working machines, and which machines were publicly
used more than two years before Gates' application for his
patents.
The history of these two machines is given by Scoville and
Brown. The former testifies that in the early part of 1878
he made two machines under the Brown patent. He says
that he and Brown loaned them to other parties to test their
value as stone breakers. The first was loaned to the Kirby
& Howe Stone Company of Iowa, who operated the machine
for nine months, when they broke the cast-iron shaft, and
then returned the machine. This machine was repaired in
the works of the Gates & Scoville Iron Works Company, of
which Scoville was then vice-president and superintendent.
This machine was then sold to the Chicago City Railway
Company, and has since been used by them. He further
testifies that the second machine was loaned to General
IcDowell, in charge of the custom-house, then in course of
erection at Chicago, and several thousand tons of concrete
and slag for the foundation were broken by this machine. It
was then returned to Scoville, who says he made some repairs
on it, and also some changes which have since been adopted
and claimed by the complainant company. This machine
was afterwards sold to Smith Bros., of Marion, Ohio. Brown
testifies that one of these two machines was made in 1877,

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.

and sold on trial to Mr. Kirby of Iowa, during the fall of that
year; that the second one was in the shop of Scoville during
the summer of 1878, and loaned the following winter to be
used in breaking stone for the construction of the United
States custom-house.
Scoville further testified that these two machines were at
first made in the manner described in the Brown patent, but
that on their return by the parties to whom they had been
loaned they were somewhat changed. Those changes he thus
describes: "They were changed by my own order, and under
my superintendence, with Mr. Brown's advice, the old breaking heads being worn, and requiring new ones. We made a
change in the new heads from the old by cutting off the
lips that form the concave for the head, making the head
level on the bottom, and also cutting off the top of the annular ring that projects up from the trough, so as to make
room for a washer or riding ring, which ring we put on to
keep the dust out from the gear. We also took out at that
time the wedges in the top of the machine for adjusting a
section of bearings around the ball, and put in sections that
just fitted. That was all the change that was made. My
recollection is that it was in November, 1878, in respect to
the breaker sold to the Chicago City Railway Company. The
second was somewhat later." He further testified as to a
provision that was made by grooves to receive zinc or other
metal that might be filled in to form a collar for the purpose of keeping the head from working off.
Brown's testimony is to the same effect, but he goes more
into detail. Among other important changes that he alleges
were made was that made at the top of the machine by leaving out the adjustable wedges around the socket bearing, and
making this bearing to fill the space around the shaft inside
of the head at the top of the machine, and that the segments
that supported the ball at the upper end of the shaft were
introduced in place of the wedges and were made or cast on
a round chill, with pieces of sheet iron placed in the mould
where the junction of the segments was designed to be, so
-hat after the casting was made it could readily be spread

Opinion of the Court.

apart into four pieces. He also states that he put a breaking
pin between the driving shaft and the gear, but this was modified by placing the breaking pin between the driving pulley
and a hub which was fastened on the countershaft. All these
changes were made in 1878, and none of them, according to
Brown, were made by the design or suggestion of P. W. Gates.
P. W. Gates, on behalf of the complainant company, testified that two machines were made by Brown, one of which
was used by the Kirby-Howe Company of Iowa, and which
was returned about September 1, 1878. The other, built by
Brown or Scoville, was loaned to the United States government to use at the custom-house, and was returned. He
admits that, in repairing these two machines, considerable
changes were made, exhibiting features not shown in the
original Brown patent, but he claims that these changes were
devised by himself.
But whether these improvements were attributable to
Brown, as testified by Scoville and Brown, oir to Gates, as he
testifies, is not specially important. What is important is
the fact, that it thus appears that several of the features
,claimed in the Gates patents were illustrated in these two
reformed Brown machines, actually in public use more than
two years before Gates applied for his patents.
The claim of Gates No. 1, for the segmental cast bearing
for the ball of the socket joint, having a form which gives it
a bearing contact upon the ball, is found in the Brown reformed machine. The claim in Gates No. 2, of a novel application of a loose collar around the eccentrically-gyrating
shaft, to prevent dirt getting into the bearing, was anticipated in the Brown machine as changed in 1878, by a circular
washer or collar upon the top of the sleeve that surrounded
the breaking head, which fitted around the shaft, the object
being to keep the dust from the machinery below.
We agree with the court below in thinking that the first
claim in Gates' patent No. 3, for the device of a depression
or groove in the outer bearing surface of the bearing box,
and applying within this depression a removable portion of
,carbon bronze metal, so as to correct the wear of the machine

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

at that place, can scarcely be deemed an invention, as the use
of soft metals for that function is shown to be old. At all
events, the defendants' machine uses Babbitt metal over the
entire surface; that is, going entirely around, instead of only
a portion of the distance. In this respect defendants' machine
follows the Brown amended machine. Nor can any force be
given to Gates' claim that the use of the Babbitt or carbon
bronze metal in the depression or groove is a new article of
manufacture. Whether or not such a device, as a merely incidental feature of a compound machine, can be deemed a
new article of manufacture, there is no proof of infringement, as it is not pretended that the defendants have ever
made any such new article of manufacture. The alleged invention in Gates' patent No. 4 is for a combination of old
features, to wit: a shaft, a bearing for the shaft, a hard metal
plate in the lower end of the shaft, an adjustable sliding step
block, and an oil step box.
All the elements of this combination were shown to be
present in the Brown machine as made and sold more than
two years before Gates applied for this patent, except the
hard-metal plate at the end of the shaft. But the use of hard
or steel-wearing plates was shown to be old, and several letters
patent, viz., 0. M. Savoye, an English patent, 1831; T. Varney, No. 63,675, issued April 9, 1867; Palen & Avery, No.
111,239, issued January 21, 1871, and several others were put
in evidence by the defendants, and exhibited the feature of
a hard-metal wearing plate at the end of the working shaft.
Our conclusion is that reached by the court below, and its
decree dismissing the bill is
Affli'med.
