THE BRITANNIA (2).
THE BEACONSFIELD.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Nos. 340, 341, and 342. Argued April 3, 4,1894.-

Decided April 23, 1894.

In entering the port of New York, the steamship Britannia came so close
to Governor's Island as to graze the bottom. This made it necessary for
her pilot to direct the engines to be put at full speed till she cleared the
ground. After that the speed of the vessel was slowed, and her wheel
was put hard-a-port to round into East River. About the time of touching bottom the Britannia sighted the steamship Beaconsfield on her starboard bow, and blew a single whistle. The Beaconsfield, going out from
the port, had also seen the Britannia when it came around Governor's
Island, and about the time it was disengaging itself from the ground,
blew a single blast of her whistle, put her helm to port a little, and went
on at a slow speed. The whistle of the Britannia was heard upon the
Beaconsfield, but that of the Beaconsfield was not heard on the Britannia.
After clearing the bottom and reducing her speed, the Britannia did not
respond promptly to her helm, owing to the fact that the condition of
the wind and tide was such as to form a flood eddy on the north side of
the channel between the Battery and Governor's Island, and an ebb tide
on the south side of the channel. These tides operate to turn the head
of a vessel attempting to enter the East River near Castle William to
the westward, as it crosses the ebb until it enter the flood eddy. Such
tidal action, and its effect upon vessels, were known to the pilot of the
Beaconsfield, and should have been known to the pilot of the Britannia.
It retarded the efforts of the Britannia to pass astern of the Beaconsfield.
The Beaconsfield thereupon blew another single whistle, and, hearing
no answer, put her wheel hard-a-port, stopped her engines and reversed
full speed. Her engines were kept in this condition until her headway
was stopped. Then she lay still in the water until struck by the Britannia and sunk. Held,

THE BRITANNIAStatement of the Case.
(1) [All concurring,] That the Britannia was in fault in running,
at a place where she was liable to meet outward going vessels,
across the ebb tide in such a way that the current prevented her
from answering her helm with promptness, and that such fault
was enough to render her liable, in whole or in part, for the loss
occasioned by the collision;
(2) [BRowN and JACKSON, JJ., dissenting,] That the Beaconsfield was
also in fault (a) in disregarding Rule 23 of the Rules for preventing Collisions on the Water, Rev. Stat. ยง 4233, directing that when,
by Rule 19, one of two vessels shall keep out of the way, the
other shall keep her course, subject to the qualifications of Rule
24; and (b) in remaining motionless for a minute and a half, in
full view of the tardy motions of the Britannia in getting astern.
The statement in Finding 31, that "the conduct of those in charge of the
Beaconsfield . . . does not warrant the inference that there was, on
their part, negligence contributory to produce the collision," is not a
finding of fact, within the meaning of the rule, but is a conclusion of
law upon the previous facts.
The act of August 19, 1890, c. 802, 26 Stat. 320, not having been proclaimed
by the President, as required by see. 3 thereof, it is not yet operative, and
this court is not bound by the construction put by English courts on
Art. 21, providing that "where, by any of these rules one of two vessels
is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed."

Ix the District Court of the United States for the Southern
District of New York, George Oleugh, of Newcastle, England,
filed his libel and complaint, as owner of the steamship Beaconsfield, against the steamship Britannia, alleging that, on the
19th day of November, 1886, the Beaconsfield, while proceeding
to sea, loaded with a full cargo of grain, between Governor's
Island and the Bkttery, was run into by the Britannia, bound
in from sea, and so badly damaged that she sank shortly afterwards in shoal water, to which she had been towed by tug
boats, and suffered damage, with loss of freight, to the amount
of 848,000. The libel further alleged that the Britannia was
running at too high a rate of speed for the place the vessels
were in, without proper lookout or sufficient attention to her
navigation, and without regard to the rules of navigation, and
that the Beaconsfield was wholly without fault. An amended
libel was subsequently filed containing a more detailed statement of the position and movements of the vessels at the time
of the collision.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

To this original and amended libel the owners of the
Britannia filed an answer traversing those allegations which
attributed fault to the Britannia, alleging that the Beaconsfield had been carelessly and negligently managed in several
particulars, which caused the collision, and praying that the
libel be dismissed.
Subsequently, J. L. Cotton, master, and George Cleugh,
owner, of the Beaconsfield, filed another and joint libel against
the Britannia, to recover for loss of cargo, containing substantially the same allegations as those made in the libel previously filed by Cleugh. This libel was likewise amended so
as to make a more particular and detailed statement of the
facts as claimed by the libellants.
To this libel an answer was duly filed by the owners of the
Britannia, denying fault on her part and alleging careless and
improper management of the Beaconsfield, which was the real
cause of the collision. They also gave security and procured
the discharge of their vessel. Thereafter the owners of the
Britannia filed a petition against the Beaconsfield, again charging the fault of the collision upon her, alleging damages
suffered by the Britannia, and praying process against the
Beaconsfield to the end that such damages might be assessed
in the same suit.
This petition was met by an answer on the part of George
Cleugh, the owner of the Beaconsfield, traversing the allegations of the petition.
At a subsequent term, the owners of the ritannia filed, in
the same court, a libel and complaint, subsequently amended,
against the Beaconsfield, containing a detailed statement of
the transaction, and praying process against and condemnation
of the Beaconsfield. To this libel, as amended, exceptions
were filed on behalf of the owner of the Beaconsfield, on the
ground of insufficiency and'indefiniteness in certain particulars.
Some of these exceptions were sustained, which led to a
further amendment of said libel. An answer to the amended
libel was then filed by the owner of the Beaconsfield.
These three cases were so proceeded in that, on the 9th day
of July, 1889, final decrees were entered, adjudging that both

Opinion of the Court.

the Britannia and the Beaconsfield were in fault, and apportioning the damages between them in such a way that there
was found due from the Britannia to the Beaconsfield, the sum
of $14,978.90, and that there was due by the Britannia to
J. L. Cotton and George Cleugh, as bailees of the cargo of
wheat laden on the Beaconsfield, the sum of $25,124.63, being
a moiety of the whole loss to cargo, the other moiety of said
loss being adjudged against the Beaconsfield. 34 Fed. Rep.
546.
From these decrees of the District Court appeals were taken
by the owners of both vessels to the Circuit Court. That
court held that the Britannia was alone in fault, and accordingly dismissed the libel of the Britannia, and awarded to
Cleugh's executor for the damages to the Beaconsfield,
$38,808.05, with costs, and to Cotton, for damages to the
cargo, $52,925.46, with costs. 42 Fed. Rep. 67.
From all three decrees, the owners of the Britannia have
appealed to this court.

Mn. JUSTICE S=a AS, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
As both the District Court and the Circuit Court, though
for somewhat different reasons, found the Britannia to be in
fault, and as we agree with them in that conclusion, it is not
necessary for us to go at length into that part of the controversy. It is sufficient to say that it appears that the Britannia
came so close to Governor's Island that she grazed the bottom,
and rendered it necessary for her pilot to direct her engines to
be put at full speed till she cleared the ground. After that
the speed of the vessel was slowed; and her wheel was put

Opinion of the Court.

hard-a-port to round into East River. As found by the Circuit
Court, at about the time of touching the bottom, she sighted
the Beaconsfield on her starboard bow, and at that time, she
blew a single whistle to the Beaconsfield, thus signifying an
intention to pass under the stern of the Beaconsfield. After
clearing the bottom and reducing her speed, the Britannia did
not respond promptly to her helm, owing to the fact, as found
in the fourth finding, that "the condition of the wind and tide
was such as to form a flood eddy on the north side of the
channel between the Battery and Governor's Island, and an
ebb tide on the south side of the channel. These tides operate
to turn the head of a vessel attempting to enter the East River
near Castle William, on Governor's Island to the westward, as
she crosses the ebb until she enters the flood eddy. Thereupon
her head is turned to the eastward. Such tidal action was
within the knowledge of the pilot of the Beaconsfield, and
should have been within the knowledge of the pilot of the
Britannia." Having placed herself in this predicament, the
Britannia's efforts to pass astern of the Beaconsfield were
retarded, and her fault was in that particular, that is, in
running, at a place where she was liable to meet outward
going vessels, across the ebb tide in such a way that the
current prevented her from answering her helm with promptness. While this fault was not, as we shall hereafter show,
the sole cause of the accident, it contributed to it, and upon
the findings, we agree with both the lower courts in thinking
the fault was enough to render the Britannia liable, in whole
or in part, for the loss occasioned by the collision. In exoneration of the Britannia her advocate cites the case of The
Rhondda, 8 App. Gas. 549, 555. That was a case somewhat
similar in its facts to the present one. The Rhondda was
coming around a point in the Straits of Messina, meeting
another steamer, the Alsace-Lorraine. They came into collision, and the Alsace-Lorraine was sunk. Her owners libelled
the Rhondda, but the Privy Council sustained the navigation
of the Rhondda. She had the other vessel on her starboard
bow, and therefore it was her duty to keep out of the way of
the Alsace-Lorraine. This she attempted to do by going to

THE BRITANNIA.
Opinion of the Court.

the starboard and passing under the stern of the other vessel.
There was a current which checked the swing of the :Rhondda
to the starboard, and her captain, as soon as he saw that his
vessel was not swinging off to starboard, under his port helm,
as he had expected, stopped and reversed his engines. The
court held that, as it appeared that the Rhondda had
ported her helm, and that such action would have carried
her clear of the other steamer if she had not been prevented
by the current, the Rhondda was free from blame. The
manceuvres, therefore, of the Britannia and the Rhondda were
alike. They were both meeting another steamer on their
starboard bow. They both, in compliance with the rule of
navigation applicable to such a case, endeavored to pass under
the stern of the other vessel by porting the helm, and they
both, when it was seen that the vessel was not swinging as
rapidly to the starboard as was expected, stopped and reversed
engines. The reason why, if the Rhondda was justly exonerated, the Britannia is not entitled to a like judgment, is
found in the different circumstances in which the vessels were
placed.
As we have seen, the Britannia was entering one of the
most crowded harbors in the world, and was liable to meet
other vessels outward bound at any moment. It was also obvious, from her course in running close to Governor's Island,
that any vessel she would meet, as she entered the strait after
she cleared the island, would probably be on her starboard
bow. Knowing, as she was bound to know, that, in the condition of the tide at the time, there was a conflict between the
current and the eddy which would be apt to thwart or retard
her movement to the starboard, it was her duty to have rounded
the island Sat the very lowest rate of speed which would have
enabled her to answer to her helm. This she failed to do,
and, although her subsequent movements were skilful and in
accordance with the rules, she must be held answerable for
her original fault in rounding the island so closely that it was
found necessary to put her engines, for a time, at full speed in
order to clear her from the ground. This temporary enhancement of speed, and the failure to anticipate and guard against

Opinion of the Court.

the consequences of a well-known current, rendered her subsequent efforts to avoid the collision unavailing.
On the other hand, in the case of the Rhondda, Sir James
Hannen, in the course of his opinion, said: "Undoubtedly it
was strongly in evidence that there was such a stream at this
place, whether it be called current or eddy, as was calculated
to have an effect in the manner suggested on a vessel coming
and would be
round into the neck of the channel, . .
felt upon the starboard bow of a vessel precisely at the point
where the Rhondda had arrived." But he proceeded to say:
"The Rhondda had no reason to anticipate that the operation
of the current or eddy would have any bearing upon her duty
with reference to the Alsace-Lorraine, because she had a right
to expect that the coast would be clearfro0/ steamers coming
out in the directio'n in which the Alsace-Lo,',aine was"
This brings us to a consideration of the conduct of the
Beaconsfield, and here the courts below parted company the District Court having held that the Beaconsfield's management was faulty, while the Circuit Court found her free from
blame. Of course, this court must accept the facts as found
for us by the Circuit Court, but we do not observe any substantial difference in the facts as understood by the respective
courts. Their diversity in opinion arose from a difference in
their, application of the rules of navigation to the admitted or
established facts.
What were those facts? The Beaconsfield descried the
Britannia when the latter vessel came around Governor's
Island, and about the time she was disengaging herself from
the ground. The Beaconsfield thereupon blew a single blast
of her whistle, which meant that she expected the Britannia
to pass under her stern. It is found that this whistle of the
Beaconsfield was neither heard nor seen on the Britannia, but
the latter's whistle, given while getting clear of the bottom,
was heard on the Beaconsfield, and taken to be an answer to
her own whistle. It is thus evident that the pilots of both
vessels agreed in the view that the proper thing to avoid collision was for the Britannia to swing to starboard and pass
behind the Beaconsfield. It was next found that the Beacons-

Opinion of the Court.

field, when she blew her first whistle, put her helm to port a
little and went on at a slow speed. Her observation of the

Britannia did not show that the latter was swinging to starboard, but even was disclosing a little more of her starboard
side to the Beaconsfield. Thereupon the latter blew another
single whistle, which still signified her expectation that the
Britannia would pass astern, and, hearing no answer, put her
wheel hard-a-port, and stopped her engines and reversed full
speed. Her engines were kept reversed until her headway
was stopped. Then her engines were stopped, and, at the
time of the collision, she was nearly, if not quite, dead in the
water. After her headway was thus stopped, the Beaconsfield
took no further action, and lay still in the water until struck.
The time from such stopping of her headway until the collision, during which she lay still, was about a minute and a half.
It is further found that if the Beaconsfield had not stopped
and backed, it is probable that the Britannia would have
passed a short distance astern of her; and, indeed, under the
finding as to her rate of speed before she stopped, this is quite
evident.
Was this behavior of the Beaconsfield in stopping her headway and remaining still, without further effort, for a minute
and a half, proper, or, at least, excusable, as held by the Circuit Court? Or was it improper, and did it put her in contributory fault, as held by the District Court?
In answering this question we must have regard to the wellknown rules of navigation. Those chiefly applicable to the
present controversy are rules nineteen, twenty-one, twentythree, and twenty-four. Rev. Stat. ยง 4233.
The nineteenth rule is as follows: "If two vessels under
steam are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel
which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out
of the way of the other." We do riot understand this rule to
signify, as the Circuit Judge seems to have thought, that the
Britannia was, at all hazards and in some way or other, to
avoid the Beaconsfield. Such a rendering of the rule would
dispense with all inquiry beyond the single one, which vessel
had the other on her starboard side. The plain meaning of

OCTOBER TERN, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the rule was, as applied to the situation under consideration,
that the Britannia, which had the Beaconsfield on her starboard side, should yield the path to the latter, and pass behind
her. This reading of the rule was recognized and complied
with in the first instance by the pilots of both vessels in signalling each other that the Britannia would go astern.
Rule twenty-one provides that "every steam vessel when
approaching another vessel so as to involve risk of collision
shall slacken her speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse."
This rule was likewise obeyed by both ships, in that, so long
as they were advancing, after having seen and signalled each
other they went at a slow rate of speed. Later, in the history
of the incident, they both stopped and reversed. In so doing
the Britannia was clearly obeying the letter and spirit of the
rule. Whether the Beaconsfield was justified in stopping and
reversing we shall presently consider.
The twenty-third rule directs that "when by rules
nineteen, . . . one of two vessels shall keep out of the
way, the other shall keep her course, subject to the qualifications of rule twenty-four." This rule throws light on the meaning of the nineteenth rule, and confirms the view that the latter
rule means that the vessel having the other on her starboard
shall yield the way or path to the other, and it further provides that the latter vessel not only may but must keep on her
course, except as qualified by the twenty-fourth rule. That
rule is as follows: "In construing and obeying these rules due
regard must be had to all dangers of navigation, and to any
special circumstances which may exist in any particular case
rendering a departure from them necessary in order to avoid
immediate danger."
As we have seen, the Britannia fulfilled the duty imposed
on her, by signalling that she would keep out of the way and
pass to the stern of the Beaconsfield, by slackening her speed,
and, finally, by stopping and reversing. Her only fault was
in overlooking or disregarding the effect of the wind and tide,
so that when she endeavored to swing to the starboard, she
was unable to do so with reasonable quickness.
But did not the Beaconsfield manifestly depart from and

THE BRITANNIA.
Opinion of the Court.

disobey rule twenty-three in not keeping her course, and thus
avoiding collision ? Her excuse, in application of rule twentyfour, is that the Britannia, after having signalled that she was
going astern, did not appear to be doing so, and that this
erratic behavior justified the Beaconsfield in stopping and
reversing. But, as already stated, the pilot of the Beaconsfield
was well aware of the existence of the counter current against
which the Britannia had to contend in changing her course to
the starboard, and if we are obliged to impute fault to the
Britannia, in not having foreseen and provided against that
current, so we must likewise blame the Beaconsfield for overlooking the effect of such current in delaying the movement
of the Britannia to the starboard. The course of the Britannia
was precisely what might have been anticipated, after her first
and only fault, and did not, in our judgment, warrant the Beaconsfield in disregarding the injunctions of the twenty-third
rule, which, if obeyed, would have prevented the collision.
We think there was likewise fault in the action of the Beaconsfield in remaining motionless for a minute and a half, in
full view of the tardy motion of the Britannia in getting
astern. This is sought to be excused by the fact that her
pilot feared certain rocks, or a rocky bottom, which were not
far from the place where his vessel was. The actual existence
of such rocks or rocky bottom was somewhat in dispute; but
accepting, as we do, the statement of the Circuit Court on the
subject, we cannot sustain the conduct of the Beaconsfield.
That statement is that "a careful collocation of the testimony
of those on both steamers and elsewhere, assisted by elaborate
plotting on the chart, indicates that the probabilities are that
the Britannia would have passed astern of the Beaconsfield if
the latter had kept her headway, even though she straightened
out sufficiently to clear the reef her pilot spoke of, but by a
very small margin only."
Stress is laid in the argument for the Beaconsfield on the
eleventh finding, that "at the time the Beaconsfield reversed
she had approached so near the New York shore that, in view
of her draft of water and the condition of the bottom in
that locality, there was some risk of her running aground

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

should she continue her way much longer under her port
helm."
But the exigency, as shown by the other findings, did not
require that she should continue her way "much longer."
Had she advanced one hundred and fifty feet, the collision
would not have taken place.'
This alleged danger of running aground on the New York
shore, if she continued her course, was not set up in the thrice
amended pleadings, and seems, as well as the suggestion that
there were rocks, not shown on the charts, on the course the
Beaconsfield was going, to have been aff afterthought, by way
of excuse, of the pilot of the Beaconsfield.
But allowing the finding to stand, it does not establish as
a fact in the case that there was any real danger to the Beaconsfield in keeping on her course for the very short distance
that would have avoided the collision. Nor was it necessary,
as the findings show, that in going on the Beaconsfield should
have approached any closer to the New York shore. There
was plenty of time and room for her to have changed her
course sufficiently to have avoided a nearer approach to the
north shore.
As for the other excuse, advanced by the pilot of the Beaconsfield, that there were rocks ahead, as already stated, it
was disposed of by the learned judge of the Circuit Court,.
who, when asked to affirmatively find that there was no reef
of rocks about 1500 feet from the Battery flag, or in that
neighborhood, as testified to by the pilot of the Beaconsfield,
refused on the stated ground that it was "'iwnaterial,as by
findings already made the collision happened well inside of
such point."
The thirteenth finding, that "shortly after the Beaconsfield
began reversing the Britannia commenced to swing to starboard, a motion which was perceived on the Beaconsfield," is
important, and strengthens the case against her. Seeing the
Britannia at last, however tardily, taking the direction which
the rule and the exchanged signals required, it was misconduct in the Beaconsfield to continue reversing, and to finally
remain motionless.

THE BRITANNIA.
Opinion of the Court.

It cannot be reasonably held that the thirty-first finding
was a finding of fact, obligatory upon this court. It is in
these words: "The conduct of those in charge of the Beaconsfield, as specifically set forth in the foregoing finding,
does not warrant the inference that there was, on their part,
negligence contributory to produce the collision."
Of course, if this were a finding of fact, within the meaning of the rule, it would be conclusive of the case, and all the
other findings would become mere surplusage. But it is evident that the learned judge did not intend it to be so regarded. It was plainly meant as an additional conclusion in
law. He speaks of it as "an inference from the foregoing
findings." Nor can we assent to the proposition that it is
competent for the judge, who is to find the facts for this court,
to shut us off from a consideration of the legal effect of the
other facts found, by a conclusive finding that, in his opinion,
a particular inference is or is not warranted by the facts so
found.
Regarding, therefore, this finding as merely expressive of
the learned judge's view of the legal conclusion that arose upon
the facts as found, and giving reasonable effect to his findings
of fact, we are unable to concur in his conclusion.
The disregard by the Beaconsfield of the Britannia's signal,
her failure to obey the rule and keep her course, and her supine
negligence in remaining motionless for so long a period, while
she saw the Britannia approaching her, clearly put her in
fault.
It is argued that the words "shall keep her course" do not
mean that she shall maintain her speed, and English cases are
cited to the effect that the rule does not imply that the vessel
shall maintain the same speed. If this is all that is meant in
the cases cited, and we so read them, we have no reason to
disagree with them, and they do not, in the slightest degree,
impugn our reasoning. But if the contention is, aid if those
cases must be understood as holding that a vessel, whose duty
it is to keep her course, complies with that duty by reversing
her engines and ceasing to move at all, we are unable to concur in such a view, It is inconsistent with both the words and

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the sense of the rule. A vessel which voluntarily becomes
motionless cannot properly be said to keep her course. The
word "course," both from its etymology and the primary
meaning given to it by lexicographer.s, signifies a running or
moving forward- a continuous progression or advance.
The collocation of the rule, and its direct references to rules
17, 19, 20, and 22, plainly point to thd meaning that, while the
other vessel must keep out of the way, the preferred vessel
shall not interfere with or thwart the movements of such other
vessel by bringing a new element into the calculation, which
would be done if, instead of pursuing her course, she stopped
her headway. It is not meant that some exigency or obvious
danger might not justify her in checking her speed, and even
in stopping altogether. But such a case is provided for in the
twenty-fourth rule. As we have seen, no such exigency is
found to have existed in the present case.
We are relieved from any force there may be in the suggestion that we ought to follow the construction supposed to
have been put upon this rule by the English courts, in order
that there should be no difference between the courts of the
two countries in construing the same rule, by the act of
August 19, 1890, 26 Stat. 327, which declares that the rule
shall be read as follows: "Where by any of these rules one of
two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her
course and speed." It, however, appears that this act awaits
the proclamation of the President to become operative.
The case of The X~orthfield and Tlte Hvnter, 4 Ben. 112,
116, is applicable to the present question in regard to the
management of the Beaconsfield. There, the Northfield, a
Staten Island ferry-boat, had left her slip to go west of Governor's Island, and was swinging round from south to southwest. The Hunter was coming down the North River and
heading south to go down west of Governor's Island. The
vessels wre therefore in similar positions in respect to each
other as the vessels in the present case. The District Court
for the Southern District of New York held, per Blatchford,
J., as follows: " Under the circumstances, the Northfield had
the Hunter on her own starboard side, and it was the duty of

THE BRITANNIA.
Opinion of the Court.

the Northfield, under the rule, to ' keep out of the way' of the
Hunter. It was equally the duty of the Hunter 'to keep her
course.' The Northfield ported her helm to a sufficient extent
to enable her to pass safely under the stern of the Hunter.
When, however, the Hunter was about three hundred yards
distant from the Northfield, instead of keeping her course, she
stopped her engines. It is quite clear that if the Hunter had
not stopped at all, but had kept her course, the Northfield
would have passed safely under the stern of the Hunter. The
stopping by the Hunter was the cause of the collision."
Disposing of the excuse set up by the Hunter for her stopping,
that her navigator assumed that the Northfield was intending
to pass ahead of the Hunter rather than astern of her, the
learned judge said: "In so assuming they took the risk of being wrong in the assumption." This case was affirmed in the
Circuit Court, and also in this court, in which this language
was used : "The officers of the tug perfectly understood that
under the rule it was their duty to keep the tug on its course.
The officers of each vessel had the right to assume that the
other vessel would do its duty, and to make their course and
keep their speed on that assumption." Hutchinson v. Northfield, 24: L. C. P. Co. Rep. 680, 681. In the case of The -Elizabeth Jones, 112 U. S. 514, 523, it was said: "Conceding it to
have been the duty of the Willis, under article 12, to keep out
of the way of the Jones, it was equally the duty of the latter
not to baffle or to prevent the efforts of the Willis to that end.
Her departure from the requirement of article 18 that she
should keep her course cannot be justified under article 19,
because there were no special circumstances in such departure
necessary in order to avoid immediate danger."
In Belden v. Chase, 150 U. S. 699, it was said: "It is a settled rule in this court that when a vessel has committed a positive breach of statute she must show not only that probably
her fault did not contribute to the disaster, but that it could
not have done so. Obedience to the rule is not a fault,
even if a different course would have prevented the collision. . . . Masters are bound to obey the rules and entitled to rely on the assumption that they will be obeyed, and

should not be encouraged to treat the exceptions as subjects
of solicitude rather than the rules."
In Crockett v. Newton-, 18 How. 581, 583, it was said by Mr.
Justice Curtis: "It must be remembered that the general rule
is, for a sailing vessel meeting a steamer, to keep her course
while the steamer takes the necessary measures to avoid a
collision. And though this rule should not be observed when
the circumstances are such that it is apparent its observance
must occasion a collision, while a departure from it will prevent one, yet it must be a strong case which puts the sailing
vessel in the wrong for obeying the rule." "But the duty of
the steamer [to port her helm and go to the starboard] implies
a correlative obligation of the ship to keep her course." The
Scotia, 14 Wall. 170, 181.
"It is the duty of a steamer .to keep out of the way of a
sailing vessel when they are approaching in such directions as
to involve a risk of collision. The correlative obligation rests
upon the sailing vessel- to keep her course and the steamer
may be managed upon the assumption that she will do so."
The Free State, 91 U. S. 200.
It is true that some of the cases just cited were cases
wherein the vessel whose duty it was to keep her course was
a sailing vessel, yet the principle involved is the same in the
case of two steamships crossing, where it is the duty of the
one who has the other on her starboard bow to keep out of
the way of the other, and of the latter to keep on her course.
The conclusion reached is the same as that arrived at in the
District Court, and, accordingly, we reverse the three decrees,
and remand the causes to the Circuit Court, with directions to
enter decrees in accordance with this opinion, that both vessels were in fault, and the damages should be divided.

I cannot agree with the court in holding the Beaconsfield

from being reckless or in violation of the rules of good seamanship, appears to me to have been characterized by an excess of prudence, which, even if it were an error, was not a
fault for which I would willingly condemn her. This court
has had frequent occasion to hold steamers liable for too
great speed. This is the first in which we have condemned
one for too little. Indeed, cases in which steamers have been
held liable for not maintaining their speed are extremely rare,
both in this country and in England; and, if any such exist,
I think they will be confined to those wherein tugs descending a river with tows have been held in fault for stopping and
allowing their tows to spread out in the path of ascending
vessels. It seems to me that the conclusion that the Beaconsfield was in fault for stopping and reversing can only be
reached by ignoring the most vital findings of fact with respect to her conduct, and proceeding upon the theory that,
because the collision would not have happened if she had kept
her speed, it was necessarily a fault that she had not done so.
The findings, so far as they bear upon the questions at issue,
are as follows:
"Fifth. . . . When about midway between Diamond Reef
and the New York piers she saw the Britannia as the latter
came clear of Castle William, and blew a single whistle to
her. The Beaconsfield was then heading about W. N. W. or
W. by N. The full speed of the Beaconsfield was between
nine and ten knots, with fifty-six revolutions. At this time
her engines were moving under an 'easy ahead,' with thirty
revolutions, which would make her speed through the water
about five knots. The retardation due to the action of the
wind and to that of the flood eddy (described in the fourth
finding) greatly reduced her speed over the ground as she
came within the influence of the eddy to considerably less
than four knots."
"Eighth. . . . While getting clear of the bottom, and
with her engines at full speed, she [the Britannia] blew a
single whistle to the Beaconsfield. The whistle of the Beaconsfield referred to in the fifth finding was neither heard nor
seen on the Britannia, but the latter's whistle, given while getvoL. CLIM-10

ting clear of the bottom, was heard on the Beaconsfield, and
taken to be an answer to her own signal. At the time the
Britannia thus signalled the distance between the steamers
was not quite half a mile.
"Ninth. After clearing the bottom the Britannia ported and
hard-a-ported her helm, but her bow while in the ebb tide
near Governor's Island did not swing to starboard, but, on
the contrary, did for a brief space take a slight but perceptible
swing to the westward.
"Tenth. When the Beaconsfield blew her first whistle her
wheel was put to port a little and kept steady-a-port, and
under her slow engine she drew ahead, her head inclining
a little toward the New York docks. A careful watch was
kept on the movements of the Britannia, and it was observed
not only that she did not swing to starboard, but also that she
was showing a little more of her starboard side to the
Beaconsfield; thereupon those upon the Beaconsfield, while
still about four lengths from the Britannia, blew another
single whistle, and hearing no answer put their wheel harda-port, and stopped and reversed full speed. Her engines were
kept reversed until her headway was stopped. Then her
engines were stopped, and at the time of the collision she was
nearly, if not cpuite, dead in the water.
"Eleventh. At the time the Beaconsfield reversed she had
approached so near the New York shore, that in view of her
draft of water and the condition of the bottom in that locality,
there was some risk of her running aground should she continue her headway much longer under her port helm. At
that time the Britannia, not yet swinging to the eastward,
was heading so as to cross the bows of the Beaconsfield, had
advanced over a considerable part of the distance which separated them when she blew her first whiistle, and was manifestly coming into the northern part of the channel.
"Twelfth. This second whistle from the Beaconsfield was
not heard on the Britannia. The latter also blew a second
single whistle and thereafter a third, neither of which was
seen or heard on the Beaconsfield.
"Thirteenth. Shortly after the Beaconsfield began reversing,

THE BRITANNIA.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

the Britannia commenced to swing to starboard, a motion
which
was perceived on the Beaconsfield.
"Fourteenth.
The captain of the Britannia had noticed that
she did not swing as promptly as he had expected after clearing
the bottom, and after she did begin to swing he saw that she
needed to come more to starboard, and that the ships for some
reason did not get clear of each other; and, differing from
the pilot as to the chance of clearing the Beaconsfield if he
kept on, he gave the order to reverse his engines; thereafter
he let go his port anchor when about one hundred feet from
the Beaconsfield."
"Twenty-fourth. At the time these steamers sighted each
other and signalled, they were crossing so as to involve risk
of collision, within the meaning of the nineteenth rule, and
the Britannia had the Beaconsfield on her starboard side.
"Twenty-fifth. At the time when the Beaconsfield stopped
and reversed, the vessels were approaching each other so as to
involve risk of collision. A prudent navigator viewing the
situation at that moment from the deck of the Beaconsfield
would have reached the conclusion that, if neither the course
of the Britannia were altered nor her headway checked, collision was imminent and inevitable, unless avoided by some
change in the movements of the Beaconsfield.
"Twenty-sixth. The Britannia's movements, visible to the
Beaconsfield, were not in accordance with the single whistle she
had blown, but were such as to create a natural, reasonable,
and strong apprehension of collision in those in charge of the
Beaconsfield, and they were thereby justified in taking the
statutory precaution to avoid risk of collision, which is prescribed by the 21st rule for a vessel approaching another
vessel so as to involve risk of collision."
Although the collision occurred in November, 1886, after the
Revised International Regulations, adopted by act of Congress
of March 3, 1885, c. 354, 23 Stat. 438, took effect, the case was
treated by court and counsel as covered by the rules prescribed
in Rev. Stat. ยง 4233, which do not, however, differ materially
from the Revised Regulations.
In connection with the above findings, the following rules
are pertinent:

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

"Rule nineteen. If two vessels under steam are crossing so as
to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her
own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other."
"Rule twenty-one. Every steam vessel, when approaching
another vessel, so as to.involve risk of collision, should slacken
her speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse."
"Rule twenty-three. Where, by rules seventeen, nineteen,
twenty, and twenty-two, one of two vessels shall keep out of
the way, the other shall keep her course, subject to the qualifications of rule twenty-four.
"Rule twenty-four. In construing and obeying these rules,
due regard must be had to all dangers of navigation, and to
any special circumstances which may exist in any particular
case rendering a departure from them necessary in order to
avoid immediate danger."
Two questions are naturally raised by the above findings:
(1) Whether the obligations imposed upon the privileged
vessel by rule 23, to "keep her course," also obliges her to
maintain her speed. (2) Granting that it does, whether this
requirement applied to the Beaconsfield under the peculiar
circumstances of this case.
(1) The rirst proposition depends upon what is meant by
keeping the course of a vessel. The word "course," as used
in this connection, is defined by the lexicographers as follows:
By Webster, as "progress from point to point without change
of direction; any part of a progress from one place to another,
which is in a straight line or in one direction." By Worcester,
as "the track or line of motion; direction in which motion
takes place." And by the Imperial Dictionary, as "the direction of motion; the line in which a body moves; as what course
shall the pilot steer; the course of a projectile through the air."
Now, unless we are to give to the word "course" a meaning
quite different from that given by the grammarians, we must
hold that the steamer discharged her obligation to "keep her
course" by keeping steadily in the direction in which she had
been previously going. But we are not without authority
upon this point. In the case of The Beryl, which was a collision in the North Sea between the steamship Abeona and the

THE BRITANNIA.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

steamship Beryl, the two vessels were approaching each other
at right angles, the Beryl being upon the starboard side of the
Abeona. The Abeona admitted that the Beryl kept her course,
but claimed that she kept it too long, directly the contrary of
the claim made by the Britannia in this case. The Beryl eased
her engines from a quarter to half a mile distant from the
Abeona. It was held by the admiralty court, 9 P. D. 4, that
although the obligation to keep her course was applicable, yet
the Beryl was bound not to disregard the obligation of the
other article to stop and reverse, if necessary to avoid a collision, and that both articles were applicable to the case. The
admiralty court held that the Beryl did act in time in stopping her engines, but on appeal to the Court of Appeals the
case was reversed, 9 P. D. 137, 140, 141, 142, 144, and the
Beryl held to be in fault, notforfailing to maintain her speed,
but for failing to stop and reverse her engines in due time.
In delivering the opinion of the court, Brett, Master of the
Rolls, observed: "It was suggested to us to-day that 'keep
her course' meant keeping her course at the same pace at
which she was going before she was called upon to obey this
rule. But keeping her course means that she is to keep on
the same direction as before: it has nothing to do with the
question of speed.

.

.

.

The Abeona was bound to get

out of the way of the Beryl; the moment that rule applied to
the Abeona, art. 22 applied to the Beryl, namely, to keep
her course.

.

.

.

The Abeona did everything that was

wrong; and then the question arises, did the Beryl break any
of the rules? She kept her course, and when she saw that
the Abeona was not doing her duty she whistled.
Seeing the Abeona was still keeping on, she whistled again
and slackened her speed. The first question upon that is this
- were the circumstances such, then, that there was risk of
collision? The vessels were at a distance of from a quarter
to half a mile. At that time the officer of the Beryl slackened his speed."
Bowen, Lord Justice, observed: "It has been suggested
that the expression 'keep her course,' used in art. 22, refers
to the speed of the vessel as well as to the direction of her

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

head, but this is an untenable argument. In art. 18 we find
the words 'stop and reverse if necessary,' which obviously are
intended to point out that the vessel, when it is necessary, is
to do more than simply slacken her speed. It may, however,
be a matter of consideration whether 'if necessary' is to be
construed as meaning if it is actually necessary, or only if the
captain should reasonably think that a necessity has arisen;
but even if we were to take the latter as the construction most
favorable to the master of the Beryl, the answer of our assessors to the question put to them, which the Master of the Rolls
has already referred to, puts him clearly in the wrong, and
obliges us to hold that the Beryl was also to blame for this
collision."
Fry, Lord Justice, was of the same opinion, and thought
that the Beryl should have stopped and reversed earlier than
she did.
This case is not only inconsistent with th- opinion of the
court in the case under consideration, but is absolutely the
reverse of it.
In view of the fact that these rules are international and
have been pronounced by this court to be a branch of the
international law, The Scotia, 14 Wall. 170, it is of the utmost
importance that the same construction should be placed upon
them by all courts upon which they are obligatory, and the
fact that the courts of the country in which they were first
adopted has given them a certain construction is a cogent
argument in favor of a similar construction elsewhere. There
is a peculiar propriety in its application in this case in view of
the fact that the Beaconsfield was a British vessel, and its
officers presumably acquainted with the law of their flag.
The only case to the contrary to which our attention has
been called is that of Thze iYortAfeld and The Hunter, 4 Ben.
112, in which, however, no such general rule of construction
was' laid down. But, under the peculiar circumstances
of that case, to which I shall advert hereafter, as distinguishing it from the case under consideration, it was held that
the privileged vessel was in fault for stopping and reversing.

THE BRITANNIA.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

(2) But, whatever be the interpretation of this rule, it seems
to me clear that, under the circumstances of the particular
case, the Beaconsfield was guilty of no fault in stopping and
reversing. It will not for a moment be claimed that a steamer
is bound to keep up her speed, if her master can see that by
so doing she must inevitably be brought into collision with
the other vessel. He is not, by a persistent adherence to any
rule, at liberty to thrust himself directly in the path of an
approaching vessel. There is certainly a point in every case
beyond which he is not bound to proceed. The obligation to
avoid a collision, if it be possible to do so, must be read into
and made a part of all steering and sailing rules, and is specially
provided for in rule 21, that "in construing and obeying these
rules, due regard must be had to all dangers of navigation,
and to any special circumstances which may exist in any
particular case rendering a departure from them necessary in
order to avoid immediate danger." There is no rule of more
general observance than that which requires sailing vessels
to keep their course when approaching a steamer, and yet in
The Sunnyside, 91 U. S. 208, a sailing vessel was condemned
for persistently adhering to the rule, and running down a
steam tug, which lay motionless upon the water, although the
latter was conceded to be in fault for not getting out of her
way. "Negligence more manifest," said Mr. Justice Clifford,
"culpable or indefensible, in view of the circumstances, is
seldom exhibited in controversies of this character; and the
only excuse offered for it is, that the 18th sailing rule provides
that, where one of two ships is required to keep out of the
way, the other shall keep her course; entirely overlooking the
fact that the mandate of that rule is declared by the rule
itself to be subject to the qualification" of rule 24. See also
The Isaac NSewton, (Croc7et v. lyewton,) 18 How. 581; Wilson
v. CanadaShiping Co., 2 App. Cas. 389.
So, rule 23, which requires the privileged steamer to keep
her course, must, like all others, be read in connection with
rule 21, that every steam vessel when approaching another
vessel so as to involve risk of collision shall slacken her speed,
or, if necessary, stop and reverse.

This case then reduces itself to the question whether, at the
time the order was given upon the Beaconsfield to stop and
reverse, the master had a right, in the exercise of a reasonable
judgment, to suppose that, if he persisted in 'his speed, a collision was probable -in other words, had he reason to believe
there was danger of collision? The sequence of events after
the steamers came in sight of each other, as appears from the
findings, was as follows:
When about midway between Diamond Reef and the New
York piers she (the Beaconsfield) saw the Britannia as the latter came clear of Castle William and blew a single whistle to
her. Owing, probably, to a strong wind then blowing from
the west, (about 22 miles an hour,) this whistle of the Beaconsfield was not heard upon the Britannia. The latter, however,
while getting clear of the bottom and her engines at full
speed, blew a single whistle to the Beaconsfield, which was
heard and taken to be an answer to her own signal. At this
time the vessels were not quite half a mile apart. Although,
after clearing the bottom, the Britannia ported and harda-ported her helm, her bow, while in the ebb tide near Governor's Island, did not swing to starboard, but on the contrary,
for a brief space took a slight but perceptible swing to the
westward -to port. It was seen upon the Beaconsfield, not
only that the Britannia did not swing to starboard, but that
she was showing a little more of her starboard side to the
Beaconsfield; whereupon the Beaconsfield, while still about
four lengths from the Britannia, blew another single whistle,
and hearing no answer, put her wheel hard-a-port, and stopped
and reversed at full speed until her headway was stopped,
when her engines were stopped and she remained motionless
in the water.
Was she in fault for so doing? There were three circumstances calculated to excite the apprehension of her master.
(1) The Britannia, instead of swinging to starboard, appeared
to be swinging to port. That this also alarmed those on the
Britannia is evident from the fourteenth finding, that after
she began to swing her master saw that she needed to come
more to starboard; that the ships did not, for some reason,

THE BRITANNIA.
Dissenting Opinion: Brown, Jackson, JJ.

get clear of each other, and, differing in opinion from the
pilot, he gave the order to reverse the engines. (2) She did
not at once answer the Beaconsfield whistle -a circumstance
tending to show either that she did not hear it, or disregarded
it. In view of the fact that the steamers were not more than
ten or twelve hundred feet apart, this silence was certainly
alarming. (3) At this time, too, the Beaconsfield had approached so near the New York shore that, in view of her
draft of water and the condition of the bottom, there was
some risk of her running aground, should she continue her
headway much longer under her port helm. In this condition
of things we are confronted by the 25th and 26th findings,
that at the time the Beaconsfield stopped and reversed, the
vessels were approaching so as to involve risk of collision.
That a prudent navigator, viewing the situation from the deck
of the Beaconsfield, would have reached the conclusion that,
if the course of the Britannia were not altered nor her headway checked, a collision was imminent and inevitable, unless
avoided by some change on the part of the Beaconsfield.
And (finding 26) that the Britannia's movements visible to
the Beaconsfield were not in accordance with the single whistle she had blown, and were such as created a natural, reasonable, and strong apprehension of collision in those in charge
of the Beaconsfield. Under these circumstances I agree with
the opinion of the court below that the Beaconsfield was justified in taking the statutory precautions to avoid risk of collision prescribed by the 21st rule, as to stopping and reversing.
The case of Northfeld and llunder, 4 Ben. 112, decided by
Judge Blatchford, whose experience as an admiralty judge undoubtedly entitles his opinions to most respectful consideration, is clearly distinguishable from this. In that case the
Northfield was going at a speed of from nine to ten knots an
hour, while the Hunter, the privileged vessel, with a schooner
in tow, was not going more than two knots an hour. The
master of the Hunter, who was fearful that the schooner
would get adrift if any extra strain should come upon his
lines, stopped his vessel. But the court expressly finds that
such stopping did not occur in awtiulo periculi, but took

OCTOBER TERIM, 1893.

place at a distance from the Northfield which would have
enabled the latter easily to have avoided her.
The only excuse for holding the Beaconsfield in fault is,
that her pilot was bound to know the existence of the eddy,
which gave the Britannia's bow a swing to port, before she
answered her wheel to swing to starboard. Considering, however, the proximity of the two vessels at this time, and the
failure of the Britannia to promptly respond to the Beaconsfield's whistle, I do not think the pilot of the latter was bound
to know the precise moment when the Britannia would begin
to answer her helm, and swing her bow to starboard. The vessels were in such proximity that seconds became of the utmost
importance, and the failure on the Britannia to do exactly
what she ought to have done meant inevitable disaster.
The case of The Rhondda, 8 App. Cas. 549, so far from
being an authority in favor of the position assumed by the
court in this case, is, as I read it, directly the contrary. The
Rhondda, having the Alsace-Lorraine on her starboard side,
was rounding Faro Point at the entrance of the Straits of
Messina, when she observed the Alsace-Lorraine at a distance
of half a mile and about a point on her starboard bow. The
Rhondda at once put her helm hard-a-port, but failed to answer her wheel in consequence of the strong current at the
entrance of the straits - the ancient Charybdis. She then blew
her whistle and stopped and 'eversed her engines at full speed,
and was held to have performed her full duty. The AlsaceLorraine did not ease or stop her engines, but put her helm
hard-a-port, and was struck by the Rbondda nearly amidships,
and was held to have been in fault. I think the case tends to
show that the Beaconsfield was right in her manoeuvre.
I would apply to this case the observations of this court in
the case of The Favorita, 18 Wall. 598, 603, in which a collision occurred under somewhat similar circumstances: "It is
said if the Manhasset had advanced instead of stopping she
would have cleared the steamship. This may or may not be
true; but if true, she is not in fault for this error of judgment. It was a question whether to advance or stop and back,
and the emergency was so great that there was no time to

Syllabus.

deliberate upon the choice of modes of escape. In such a
moment of sudden danger, caused by the misconduct of the

Favorita, the law will not hold the pilot of the Manhasset,
acting in good faith, guilty of a fault, if it should turn out
after the event that he chose the wrong means to avoid the
collision, unless his seamanship was clearly unskilful. And
this we do not find to be the case. On the contrary, if there
were error at all, it was such a mistake of judgment as would
likely be committed by any one in similar peril." (See S.C.
1 Ben. 30; 8 Blatcbford, 539.)
I agree with the court that the thirty-first finding is a
finding of law and not of fact, but I think it was such a legal
conclusion as was justified by the other findings.
For these reasons I am of opinion that the decree of the
Circuit Court should be affirmed.

No. 1054. Argued March 5, 6,1894. - Decided April 23, 1894.

The compact of March 28, 1785, between the States of Virginia and Maryland, having been duly ratified by each State, is binding upon both as to
the subjects embraced within it, so far as it is not inconsistent with the
Constitution of the United States.
That compact was not prohibited by Article 6 of the articles of Confederation, forbidding any treaty, confederation or alliance between two or
more States without the consent of Congress; and it continued in force
after the adoption of the Constitution, except so far as inconsistent
with its provisions, and received the assent of Congress by the adoption
or approval of proceedings taken under it.
The compact of 1785 contained no reference to fish of any kind in Pocomoke River or Pocomoke Sound, and no clause in that compact gave
Maryland a right to fish in that river or sound.
