STEWART, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTION, ET AL. v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 97-300. Argued February 25, 1998-Decided May 18, 1998
Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.
His direct appeals and habeas petitions in the Arizona state courts were
unsuccessful, and his first three federal habeas petitions were denied on
the ground that he had not exhausted his state remedies. In his fourth
federal habeas petition, he claimed, inter alia,that he was incompetent
to be executed under Ford v. Wainwright,477 U. S. 399. The District
Court dismissed that claim as premature, but granted the writ on other
grounds. In reversing the granting of the writ, the Ninth Circuit explained that its ruling was not intended to affect later litigation of the
Fordclaim. On remand, respondent moved to reopen his petition, fearing that review of his Ford claim might be foreclosed by the newly
enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA),
which establishes a "gatekeeping" mechanism for the consideration of
"second or successive [federal] habeas corpus applications," Felker v.
Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 657; 28 U. S. C. §2244(b). Under AEDPA, a prisoner must ask the appropriate court of appeals to direct the district
court to consider such an application, §2244(b)(3)(A), and a court of appeals' decision whether to authorize an application's filing is not appealable and cannot be the subject of a petition for rehearing or a writ
of certiorari, §2244(b)(3)(E). The District Court denied the motion.
Subsequently, Arizona obtained a warrant for respondents execution,
and the state courts found him fit to be executed. The District Court
denied another motion to reopen his Ford claim, holding that it lacked
jurisdiction under AEDPA. He then asked the Ninth Circuit for permission to file a successive habeas application. That court held that
§2244(b) did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be
executed claim and that respondent did not, therefore, need authorization to file his petition in the District Court.
Hel&d
1. Because respondent's claim was not a "second or successive" petition under §2244(b), this Court has jurisdiction to review the Ninth
Circuit's judgment on petitioners' certiorari petition. The fact that this
was the second time that respondent asked the federal courts to provide

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL

Syllabus
relief on his Ford claim does not mean that there were two separate
applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to §2244(b).
There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court
ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim when it became ripe. Since
respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented
in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application, the Ninth Circuit
correctly held that he was not required to get authorization to file a
"second or successive" application before his Ford claim could be heard.
Accepting petitioners' interpretation-that once an individual has one
fully litigated habeas petition, his new petition must be treated as successive-would have far-reaching and seemingly perverse implications
for habeas practice. This Court's cases have never suggested that a
prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust
state remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and returned
to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition. A court
would adjudicate those claims under the same standard as would govern
those made in any other first petition. Respondent's Ford claim-previously dismissed as premature-should be treated in the same manner,
for, in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive an adjudication of his claim. To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of
a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons, having nothing
to do with the claim's merits, would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining
federal habeas review. Petitioners' reliance on Felker v. Turpin, supra,
for a contrary interpretation is misplaced. Pp. 641-645.
2. For the same reasons that this Court finds it has jurisdiction, it
finds that the Ninth Circuit correctly decided that respondent was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his Ford claim in the District Court.

In Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 410 (1986), we held
that "the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insane." In
this case, we must decide whether respondent MartinezVillareal's Fordclaim is subject to the restrictions on "second
or successive" applications for federal habeas relief found in
the newly revised 28 U. S. C. § 2244 (1994 ed., Supp. II). We
conclude that it is not.

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
Opinion of the Court

Arizona state courts. Arizona v. Martinez-Villareal, 145
Ariz. 441, 702 P. 2d 670, cert. denied, 474 U. S. 975 (1985).
He then filed a series of petitions for habeas relief in state
court, all of which were denied. He also fied three petitions
for habeas relief in federal court, all of which were dismissed
on the ground that they contained claims on which the state
remedies had not yet been exhausted.
In March 1993, respondent filed a fourth habeas petition in
federal court. In addition to raising other claims, respondent asserted that he was incompetent to be executed.
Counsel for the State urged the District Court to dismiss
respondent's Ford claim as premature. The court did so but
granted the writ on other grounds. The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's granting
of the writ but explained that its instruction to enter judgment denying the petition was not intended to affect any
later litigation of the Ford claim. Martinez-Villareal v.
Lewis, 80 F. 3d 1301, 1309, n. 1 (1996).
On remand to the District Court, respondent, fearing that
the newly enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) might foreclose review of his Ford claim,
moved the court to reopen his earlier petition. In March
1997, the District Court denied the motion and reassured
respondent that it had "'no intention of treating the [Ford]
claim as a successive petition."' 118 F. 3d 628, 630 (CA9
1997). Shortly thereafter, the State obtained a warrant for
respondents execution. Proceedings were then held in the
Arizona Superior Court on respondent's mental condition.
That court concluded that respondent was fit to be executed.
The Arizona Supreme Court rejected his appeal of that
decision.
Respondent then moved in the Federal District Court to
reopen his Ford claim. He challenged both the conclusions
reached and the procedures employed by the Arizona state
courts. Petitioners responded that under AEDPA, the
court lacked jurisdiction. The District Court agreed with

Cite as: 523 U. S. 637 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

petitioners, ruling on May 16, 1997, that it did not have jurisdiction over the claim. Respondent then moved in the
Court of Appeals for permission to file a successive habeas
corpus application. § 2244(b)(3).
The Court of Appeals stayed respondent's execution
so that it could consider his request. It later held that
§ 2244(b) did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be executed claim and that respondent did not,
therefore, need authorization to fie the petition in the District Court. It accordingly transferred the petition that had
been presented to a member of that court back to the District Court. 118 F. 3d, at 634-635.
We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 912 (1997), to resolve an
apparent conflict between the Ninth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit on this important question of federal law. See,
e. g., In re Medina, 109 F. 3d 1556 (CAll 1996).
Before reaching the question presented, however, we must
first decide whether we have jurisdiction over this case. In
AEDPA, Congress established a "gatekeeping" mechanism
for the consideration of "second or successive habeas corpus
applications" in the federal courts. Felker v. Turpin, 518
U. S. 651, 657 (1996); § 2244(b). An individual seeking to file
a "second or successive" application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application. §2244(b)(3)(A). The
court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant
the authorization to fie. §2244(b)(3)(D). A court of appeals' decision whether to grant authorization "to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and
shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a
writ of certiorari." §2244(b)(3)(E).
If the Court of Appeals in this case had granted respondent leave to file a second or successive application, then we
would be without jurisdiction to consider petitioners' petition and would have to dismiss the writ. This is not, however, what the Court of Appeals did. The Court of Appeals

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL

Opinion of the Court

held that the § 2244(b) restrictions simply do not apply to
respondent's Ford claim, and that there was accordingly no
need for him to apply for authorization to file a second or
successive petition. We conclude today that the Court of
Appeals reached the correct result in this case, and that we
therefore have jurisdiction to consider petitioners' petition.
Section 2244(b) provides:
"(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
"(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not
presented in a prior application shall be dismissed
unless"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a
new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases
on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was
previously unavailable; or
"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not
have been discovered previously through the exercise of
due diligence; and
"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and
viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be
sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense."
If respondent's current request for relief is a "second or
successive" application, then it plainly should have been dismissed. The Ford claim had previously been presented in
the 1993 petition, and would therefore be subject to dismissal
under subsection (b)(1). Even if we were to consider the
Ford claim to be newly presented in the 1997 petition, it does
not fit within either of subsection (b)(2)'s exceptions, and dismissal would still be required.

Opinion of the Court

Petitioners contend that because respondent has already
had one "fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of
§ 2244(b) as amended requires his new petition to be treated
as successive." Brief for Petitioners 12. Under that reading of the statute, respondent is entitled to only one merits
judgment on his federal habeas claims. Because respondent
has already presented a petition to the District Court, and
the District Court and the Court of Appeals have acted on
that petition, §2244(b) must apply to any subsequent request
for federal habeas relief.
But the only claim on which respondent now seeks relief
is the Ford claim that he presented to the District Court,
along with a series of other claims, in 1993. The District
Court, acting for the first time on the merits of any of respondent's claims for federal habeas relief, dismissed the
Ford claim as premature, but resolved all of respondent's
other claims, granting relief on one. The Court of Appeals
subsequently reversed the District Court's grant of relief.
At that point it became clear that respondent would have no
federal habeas relief for his conviction or his death sentence,
and the Arizona Supreme Court issued a warrant for his execution. His claim then unquestionably ripe, respondent
moved in the state courts for a determination of his competency to be executed. Those courts concluded that he was
competent, and respondent moved in the Federal District
Court for review of the state court's determination.
This may have been the second time that respondent had
asked the federal courts to provide relief on his Ford claim,
but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to
§ 2244(b). There was only one application for habeas relief,
and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each
claim at the time it became ripe. Respondent was entitled
to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier,
undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.
The Court of Appeals was therefore correct in holding that

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
Opinion of the Court

respondent was not required to get authorization to fie a
"second or successive" application before his Ford claim
could be heard.
If petitioners' interpretation of "second or successive"
were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be
far reaching and seemingly perverse. In Picard v. Connor,
404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971), we said:
"It has been settled since Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S.
241 (1886), that a state prisoner must normally exhaust
available state judicial remedies before a federal court
will entertain his petition for habeas corpus.... The

exhaustion-of-state-remedies doctrine, now codified in
the federal habeas statute, 28 U. S. C. §§ 2254(b) and (c),
reflects a policy of federal-state comity.... It follows, of
course, that once the federal claim has been fairly presented to the state courts, the exhaustion requirement
is satisfied."
Later, in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 522 (1982), we went
further and held that "a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted
claims." But none of our cases expounding this doctrine
have ever suggested that a prisoner whose habeas petition
was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, and who
then did exhaust those remedies and returned to federal
court, was by such action fling a successive petition. A
court where such a petition was filed could adjudicate these
claims under the same standard as would govern those made
in any other first petition.
We believe that respondent's Ford claim here-previously
dismissed as premature-should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies. True, the cases
are not identical; respondent's Ford claim was dismissed as
premature, not because he had not exhausted state remedies,
but because his execution was not imminent and therefore

Cite as: 523 U. S. 637 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

his competency to be executed could not be determined at
that time. But in both situations, the habeas petitioner does
not receive an adjudication of his claim. To hold otherwise
would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for
technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from
ever obtaining federal habeas review. See, e. g., United
States ex rel. Barnes v. Gilmore, 968 F. Supp. 384, 385 (ND
Ill. 1997) ("If Barnes continues in his nonpayment of the required $5 filing fee . . . this Court will be constrained to
dismiss his petition"); Marsh v. United States District Court
for the Northern Districtof California,1995 WL 23942 (ND
Cal., Jan. 9, 1995) ("Because petitioner has since not paid
the filing fee nor submitted a signed affidavit of poverty, the
petition for writ of habeas corpus is dismissed without prejudice"); Taylor v. Mendoza, 1994 WL 698493 (ND Ill., Dec.
12, 1994).*
Petitioners place great reliance on our decision in Felker
v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996), but we think that reliance is
misplaced. In Felker we stated that the "new restrictions
on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata
rule, a restraint on what used to be called in habeas corpus
practice 'abuse of the writ."' Id., at 664. It is certain that
respondent's Ford claim would not be barred under any form
of res judicata. Respondent brought his claim in a timely
fashion, and it has not been ripe for resolution until now.
Thus, respondents Ford claim was not a "second or successive" petition under §2244(b) and we have jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals on petitioners'
petition for certiorari. But for the same reasons that we
find we have jurisdiction, we hold that the Court of Appeals
was correct in deciding that respondent was entitled to a
*This case does not present the situation where a prisoner raises a Ford
claim for the first time in a petition filed after the federal courts have
already rejected the prisoner's initial habeas application. Therefore, we
have no occasion to decide whether such a filing would be a "second or
successive habeas corpus application" within the meaning of AEDPA.

hearing on the merits of his Ford claim in the District Court.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore
Affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
It is axiomatic that "the power to award the writ [of habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must
be given by written law." Ex.parte Boilman, 4 Cranch 75,
94 (1807) (opinion of Marshall, C. J.). And it is impossible to
conceive of language that more clearly precludes respondent's renewed competency-to-be-executed claim than the
written law before us here: a "claim presented in a second or
successive habeas corpus application... that was presented
in a prior application shall be dismissed." 28 U. S. C.
§2244(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). The
Court today flouts the unmistakable language of the statute
to avoid what it calls a "perverse" result. Ante, at 644.
There is nothing "perverse" about the result that the statute
commands, except that it contradicts pre-existing judgemade law, which it was precisely the purpose of the statute
to change.
Respondent received a full hearing on his competency-tobe-executed claim in state court. The state court appointed
experts and held a 4-day evidentiary hearing, after which it
found respondent "aware that he is to be punished for the

crime of murder and ... aware that the impending punishment for that crime is death .... " App. 172. Respondent

appealed this determination to the Supreme Court of Arizona, which accepted jurisdiction and denied relief. He
sought certiorari of that denial in this Court, which also denied relief. To say that it is "perverse" to deny respondent
a second round of time-consuming lower-federal-court review
of his conviction and sentence-because that means forgoing
lower-federal-court review of a competency-to-be-executed
claim that arises only after he has already sought federal

Cite as: 523 U. S. 637 (1998)
ScAmA, J., dissenting

habeas on other issues-is to say that state-court determinations must always be reviewable, not merely by this Court,
but by federal district courts. That is indeed the principle
that this Court's imaginative habeas-corpus jurisprudence
had established, but it is not a principle of natural law. Lest
we forget, Congress did not even have to create inferior federal courts, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 9; Art. III, § 1, let
alone invest them with plenary habeas jurisdiction over state
convictions. And for much of our history, as JUSTICE
THOMAS points out, post, at 652, prisoners convicted by validly constituted courts of general criminal jurisdiction had
no recourse to habeas corpus relief at all. See Wright v.
West, 505 U. S. 277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
It seems to me much further removed from the "perverse"
to deny second-time collateral federal review than it is
to treat state-court proceedings as nothing more than a
procedural prelude to lower-federal-court review of state
supreme-court determinations. The latter was the regime
that our habeas jurisprudence established and that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) intentionally revised-to require extraordinary showings before
a state prisoner can take a second trip around the extended
district-court-to-Supreme-Court federal track. It is wrong
for us to reshape that revision on the very lathe of judgemade habeas jurisprudence it was designed to repair.
Today's opinion resembles nothing so much as the cases
of the 1920's that effectively decided that the Clayton Act,
designed to eliminate federal-court injunctions against union
strikes and picketing, "restrained the federal courts from
nothing that was previously proper." T. Powell, The Supreme Court's Control Over the Issue of Injunctions in
Labor Disputes, 13 Acad. Pol. Sci. Proc. 37, 74 (1928). In
criticizing those cases as examples of Gefiihlsjurisprudenz
(and in insisting upon "the necessity of preferring.., the
Gef'ihl of the legislator to the Gefithl of the judge"), Dean
Landis recalled Dicey's trenchant observation that "'judge-

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
THOMAS, J., dissenting

made law occasionally represents the opinion of the day before yesterday."' Landis, A Note on "Statutory Interpretation," 43 Harv. L. Rev. 886, 888 (1930), quoting A. Dicey, Law
and Opinion in England 369 (1926). As hard as it may be for
this Court to swallow, in yesterday's enactment of AEDPA
Congress curbed our prodigality with the Great Writ. The
words that Landis applied to the Clayton Act fit very nicely
the statute that emerges from the Court's decision in the
present case: "The mutilated [AEDPA] bears ample testimony to the 'day before yesterday' that judges insist is
today." 43 Harv. L. Rev., at 892. I dissent.
JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,
dissenting.
From 1986 to 1991, respondent filed three petitions for federal habeas relief; each was dismissed on the ground that
respondent had not yet exhausted his state remedies. In
March 1993, respondent filed his fourth federal habeas petition presenting, inter alia,his claim under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), that he was not competent to be
executed. Finding that some of respondent's claims were
procedurally defaulted, that others were without merit, and
that respondent's Ford claim was not ripe for decision, the
Court of Appeals held that the fourth petition should be denied. In May 1997, after the Arizona state courts rejected
his Ford claim, respondent returned for a fifth time to federal court, again arguing that he was incompetent to be executed. Because this filing was a "second or successive habeas corpus application," respondent's Ford claim should
have been dismissed. I therefore respectfully dissent.
Unlike the Court, I begin with the plain language of the
statute. Section 2244(b)(1) provides that a "claim presented
in a second or successive habeas corpus application... that
was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed." 28

U. S. C. § 2244(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II). An "application" is

a "putting to, placing before, preferring a request or petition

Cite as: 523 U. S. 637 (1998)
THOZMAS, J., dissenting

to or before a person. The act of making a request for something." Black's Law Dictionary 98-99 (6th ed. 1990); see
also Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 97 (1991)
(application is a "request, petition.., a form used in making
a request"). Respondent's March 1993 federal habeas petition was clearly a habeas "application" (the Court concedes
as much), because it placed before the District Court respondent's request for a writ of habeas corpus. Once this
application was denied, however, none of respondent's claims
for relief-including his claim that he was incompetent to be
executed-remained before the Court. It was thus necessary for respondent to file a new request for habeas relief so
that his Ford claim would again be "pu[t] to" or "plac[ed]
before" the District Court. (The Court certainly did not
raise respondent's Ford claim sua sponte.) Respondent's
May 1997 request for relief was therefore a habeas application distinct from his earlier requests for relief, and it was
thus undoubtedly "second or successive."
Respondent's Ford claim was also "presented" in both his
March 1993 and his May 1997 habeas applications. To "present" is "to bring or introduce into the presence of someone"
or "to lay (as a charge) before a court as an object of inquiry."
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 930 (1991). Respondent clearly "presented" his Ford claim in both his 1993
and his 1997 habeas applications, for in each he introduced
to the District Court his argument that he is not competent
to be executed. Under the plain meaning of the statute,
therefore, respondent's Ford claim was a "claim presented in
a second or successive habeas corpus application.., that was
presented in a prior application." § 2244(b)(1).
The reasons offered by the Court for disregarding the
plain language of the statute are unpersuasive. Conceding
that "[t]his may have been the second time that respondent
had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his Ford
claim," ante, at 643, the Court nevertheless concludes that
respondent has really filed only "one application for habeas

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
THOMAS, J., dissenting

relief," ibid. (emphasis added). The District Court, however, did not hold respondent's Ford claim in abeyance when
it denied his March 1993 habeas petition, so that claim was
no longer before the District Court in May 1997. At best,
then, respondent's May 1997 filing was an effort to reopen
his Ford claim. But that ffling (which is most definitely an
"application") is subject to the statutory requirements for
second or successive habeas applications. As we have recently stated in a closely related context:
"[A] prisoner's motion to recall the mandate on the basis
of the merits of the underlying decision can be regarded
as a second or successive application for purposes of
§2244(b). Otherwise, petitioners could evade the bar
against relitigation of claims presented in a prior application, § 2244(b)(1), or the bar against litigation of claims
not presented in a prior application, §2244(b)(2)." Calderon v. Thompson, ante, at 553.
In just the same way, habeas petitioners cannot be permitted
to evade § 2244(b)'s prohibitions simply by moving to reopen
claims already presented in a prior habeas application.
The Court also reasons that respondent's "Ford claim
here-previously dismissed as premature-should be treated
in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns
to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies,"
for "in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive
an adjudication of his claim." Ante, at 644, 645. Implicit in
the Court's reasoning is its assumption that a prisoner whose
habeas petition has been dismissed for failure to exhaust
state remedies, and who then exhausts those remedies and
returns to federal court, has not then filed a "second or successive habeas corpus application." §2244(b)(1). To be
sure, "none of our cases . . . ha[s] ever suggested" that a

prisoner in such a situation was filing a successive petition.
See ante, at 644. But that is because, before enactment of
the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996

Cite as: 523 U. S. 637 (1998)
THOMAS, J., dissenting

(AEDPA),' 110 Stat. 1218, a federal court could grant relief
on a claim in a second or successive application so long
as the ground for relief had not already been "presented
and determined," 28 U. S. C. §2244(a) (emphasis added), or
"adjudicated," §2244(b), in a previous application. Claims
presented in a petition dismissed for failure to exhaust are
neither "determined" nor "adjudicated." Thus, the preAEDPA practice of permitting petitioners to raise claims already presented in applications dismissed for failure to exhaust says nothing about whether those later applications
were considered second or successive.
Even if the Court were correct that such an application
would not have been considered second or successive, such a
case is altogether different from this case, in which only one
of many claims was not adjudicated. In the former situation, the federal court dismisses the unexhausted petition
without prejudice, see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 520-522
(1982), so it could be argued that the petition should be
treated as if it had never been fied. In contrast, when a
court addresses a petition and adjudicates some of the claims
presented in it, that petition is certainly an "application,"
and any future application must be "second or successive."'
Otherwise, the court would have adjudicated the merits
of
'2
claims that had not been presented in an "application."
Ultimately, the Court's holding is driven by what it sees
as the "far reaching and seemingly perverse." implications
for federal habeas practice of a literal reading of the statute.
IIf the Court's position is that respondent's May 1997 filing was an "application," but not a "second or successive" one, presumably 28 U. S. C.
§2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II) would not have precluded. respondent from
presenting, along with his claim under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399
(1986), a claim previously adjudicated on the merits, for § 2244(b) operates
to bar only those claims presented in "second or successive" applications.
2Even if a claim dismissed without prejudice could be treated as having
never been presented, dismissal, as the Court concedes, would still be
required because a Ford claim does not fit within §2244(b)(2)(B)'s exceptions for claims not presented in prior applications. See ante, at 642.

STEWART v. MARTINEZ-VILLAREAL
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Ante, at 644. Such concerns are not, in my view, sufficient
to override the statute's plain meaning. And to the extent
concerns about habeas practice motivate the Court's decision, it bears repeating that federal habeas corpus is a statutory right and that this Court, not Congress, has expanded
the availability of the writ. Before this judicial expansion,
a prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus was permitted to
challenge only the jurisdiction of the court that had rendered
the judgment under which he was in custody. See Wright
v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
A Ford claim obviously does not present such a challenge.3
A statute that has the effect of precluding adjudication of a
claim that for most of our Nation's history would have been
considered noncognizable on habeas can hardly be described
as "perverse."
Accordingly, whether one considers respondent's March
1993 federal habeas petition to have been his first habeas
application-because his three previous applications had
been dismissed for failure to exhaust-or his fourth-because respondent had already filed three previous habeas applications by that time-his May 1997 request for relief was
undoubtedly either a "second" (following his first) or "successive" (following his fourth) habeas application. Respondent's Ford claim, presented in this second or successive application, should have been dismissed as a "claim... presented
in a prior application." §2244(b)(1).

There is an additional reason why a state prisoner's Ford claim may
not be cognizable on federal habeas. A state prisoner may bring a federal
habeas petition "only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of
the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C.
§ 2254. A Ford claim does not challenge either the prisoner's underlying
conviction or the legality of the sentence; it challenges when (or whether)
the sentence can be carried out.
