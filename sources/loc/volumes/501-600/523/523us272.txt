OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY ET AL.
v.WOODARD
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-1769.

Argued December 10, 1997-Decided March 25, 1998

After respondent Woodard's Ohio murder conviction and death sentence
were affirmed on direct appeal and this Court denied certiorari, petitioner Ohio Adult Parole Authority commenced its clemency investigation in accordance with state law, informing respondent that he could
have his voluntary interview with Authority members on a particular
date, and that his clemency hearing would be held a week later. Respondent filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that Ohio's
clemency process violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process right
and his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The District Court
granted judgment on the pleadings to the State, and the Sixth Circuit
affirmed in part and reversed in part. Noting that Connecticut Bd. of
Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 464-465, had decisively rejected
the argument that federal law can create a liberty interest in clemency,
the latter court held that respondent had failed to establish a life or
liberty interest protected by due process. The court also held, however, that respondent's "original" pretrial life and liberty interests were
protected by a "second strand" of due process analysis under Evitts v.
Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 393, although the amount of process due could be
minimal because clemency, while an "integral part" of the adjudicatory
system, is far removed from trial. The court remanded for the District
Court to decide what that process should be. Finally, the Sixth Circuit
concluded that Ohio's voluntary interview procedure presented respondent with a "Hobson's choice" between asserting his Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination and participating in Ohio's clemency
review process, thereby raising the specter of an unconstitutional
condition.
Held: The judgment is reversed.
107 F. 3d 1178, reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Part III, concluding that giving an inmate the option of voluntarily
participating in an interview as part of the clemency process does not
violate his Fifth Amendment rights. That Amendment protects
against compelled self-incrimination. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425

Syllabus
U. S. 308, 316-318. Even on assumptions most favorable to respondent's claim--i. e., that nothing in the clemency procedure grants applicants immunity for what they might say or makes the interview in any
way confidential, and that the Authority will draw adverse inferences
from respondent's refusal to answer questions-his testimony at a voluntary interview would not be "compelled." He merely faces a choice
quite similar to those made by a criminal defendant in the course of
criminal proceedings. For example, a defendant who chooses to testify
in his own defense abandons the privilege against self-incrimination
when the prosecution seeks to cross-examine him, and may be impeached by proof of prior convictions. In these situations, the undoubted pressures to testify that are generated by the strength of the
government's case do not constitute "compulsion" for Fifth Amendment
purposes. See Williams v. Florida,399 U.S. 78,84-85. Similarly, respondent here has the choice of providing information to the Authority-at the risk of damaging his case for clemency or for postconviction
relief-or of remaining silent, but the pressure to speak does not make
the interview compelled. Pp. 285-288.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,
and JUSTICE THOiAS, concluded in Part II that an inmate does not
establish a violation of the Due Process Clause in clemency proceedings,
under either Dumschat or Evitts, where, as here, the procedures in
question do no more than confirm that such decisions are committed, as
is the Nation's tradition, to the executive's authority. This Court reaffirms its holding in Dumschat, supra, at 464, that pardon and commutation decisions are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review.
Respondent's argument that there is a continuing life interest in clemency that is broader in scope than the "original" life interest adjudicated
at trial and sentencing is barred by Dumschat. The process respondent seeks would be inconsistent with the heart of executive clemency,
which is to grant clemency as a matter of grace, thus allowing the executive to consider a wide range of factors not comprehended by earler judicial proceedings and sentencing determinations. Although respondent maintains a residual life interest, e. g., in not being summarily
executed by prison guards, he cannot use that interest to challenge the
clemency determination by requiring the procedural protections he
seeks. Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 7. Also rejected is respondents claim that clemency
is entitled to due process protection under Evitts. Expressly relying
on the combination of two lines of cases to justify the conclusion that a
criminal defendant has a right to effective assistance of counsel on a
first appeal as of right, 469 U. S., at 394-396, the Evitts Court did not

purport to create a new "strand" of due process analysis, and it did not
rely on the notion of a continuum of due process rights, as respondent
claims. There is no such continuum. See, e. g., Murray v. Giarratano,
492 U. S.1, 9-10. An examination of the function and significance of
the discretionary clemency decision at issue here readily shows that it
is far different from a first appeal as of right, and thus is not "'an integral part of the ...

system for finally adjudicating... guilt or inno-

cence,"' as Evitts, supra, at 393, requires. Pp. 279-285.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG,
and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded that, because a prisoner under a death
sentence has a continuing interest in his life, the question raised is what
process is constitutionally necessary to protect that interest. Although
due process demands are reduced once society has validly convicted an
individual of a crime and therefore established its right to punish, Ford
v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 429 (O'CoNNoR, J., concurring in result in
part and dissenting in part), the Court of Appeals correctly concluded
that some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings. Judicial intervention might, for example, be warranted in the face
of a scheme whereby a state official flipped a coin to determine whether
to grant clemency, or in a case where the State arbitrarily denied a
prisoner any access to its clemency process. However, a remand to
permit the District Court to address respondent's specific allegations of
due process violations is not required. The process he received comports with Ohio's regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due
Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings. Pp. 288-290.

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD
Opinion of the Court

first is whether an inmate has a protected life or liberty interest in clemency proceedings, under either Connecticut Bd.
of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458 (1981), or Evitts v.
Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The second is whether giving
inmates the option of voluntarily participating in an interview as part of the clemency process violates an inmate's
Fifth Amendment rights.
We reaffirm our holding in Dumschat, supra,that "pardon
and commutation decisions have not traditionally been the
business of courts; as such, they are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review." Id., at 464 (footnote
omitted). The Due Process Clause is not violated where, as
here, the procedures in question do no more than confirm
that the clemency and pardon powers are committed, as is
our tradition, to the authority of the executive.' We further
hold that a voluntary inmate interview does not violate the
Fifth Amendment.
I

The Ohio Constitution gives the Governor the power to
grant clemency upon such conditions as he thinks proper.
Ohio Const., Art. III, §2. The Ohio General Assembly cannot curtail this discretionary decisionmaking power, but it
may regulate the application and investigation process.
State v. Sheward, 71 Ohio St. 3d 513, 524-525, 644 N. E. 2d
369, 378 (1994). The General Assembly has delegated in
large part the conduct of clemency review to petitioner Ohio
Adult Parole Authority (Authority). Ohio Rev. Code Ann.
§2967.07 (1993).
In the case of an inmate under death sentence, the Authority must conduct a clemency hearing within 45 days of the
scheduled date of execution. Prior to the hearing, the inmate may request an interview with one or more parole
'JUSTICE STEVENS in dissent says that a defendant would be entitled
to raise an equal protection claim in connection with a clemency decision.
Post,at 292. But respondent has raised no such claim here, and therefore
we have no occasion to decide that question.

Opinion of the Court

board members. Counsel is not allowed at that interview.
The Authority must hold the hearing, complete its clemency
review, and make a recommendation to the Governor, even
if the inmate subsequently obtains a stay of execution. If
additional information later becomes available, the Authority
may in its discretion hold another hearing or alter its
recommendation.
Respondent Eugene Woodard was sentenced to death for
aggravated murder committed in the course of a carjacking.
His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, State
v. Woodard, 68 Ohio St. 3d 70, 623 N. E. 2d 75 (1993), and
this Court denied certiorari, 512 U. S. 1246 (1994). When
respondent failed to obtain a stay of execution more than
45 days before his scheduled execution date, the Authority
commenced its clemency investigation. It informed respondent that he could have a clemency interview on September 9, 1994, if he wished, and that his clemency hearing
would be on September 16, 1994.
Respondent did not request an interview. Instead, he objected to the short notice of the interview and requested assurances that counsel could attend and participate in the interview and hearing. When the Authority failed to respond
to these requests, respondent fied suit in United States District Court on September 14, alleging under Rev. Stat.
§ 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, that Ohio's clemency process violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and
his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
The District Court granted the State's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 107 F. 3d 1178
(1997). That court determined that under a "first strand" of
due process analysis, arising out of the clemency proceeding
itself, respondent had failed to establish a protected life or
liberty interest. It noted that our decision in Dumschat,
supra, at 464-465, "decisively rejected the argument that

278

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD

Opinion of the Court

federal law can create a liberty interest in clemency." 107
F. 3d, at 1183.
The Court of Appeals further concluded that there was
no state-created life or liberty interest in clemency. Id., at
1184-1185. Since the Governor retains complete discretion
to make the final decision, and the Authority's recommendation is purely advisory, the State has not created a protected
interest. Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238, 249 (1983).
The court noted that it would reach the same conclusion
under Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995), to the extent
that decision modified the Olim analysis.
The Court of Appeals went on to consider, however, a "second strand" of due process analysis centered on "the role of
clemency in the entire punitive scheme." 107 F. 3d, at 1186.
The court relied on our statement in Evitts that "if a State
has created appellate courts as 'an integral part of the...
system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a
defendant,'... the procedures used in deciding appeals must
comport with the demands of" due process. 469 U. S., at
393 (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S.12, 18 (1956)). The
court thought this reasoning logically applied to subsequent
proceedings, including discretionary appeals, postconviction
proceedings, and clemency.
Due process thus protected respondent's "original" life and
liberty interests that he possessed before trial at each proceeding. But the amount of process due was in proportion
to the degree to which the stage was an "integral part" of
the trial process. Clemency, while not required by the Due
Process Clause, was a significant, traditionally available remedy for preventing miscarriages of justice when judicial process was exhausted. It therefore came within the Evitts
framework as an "integral part" of the adjudicatory system.
However, since clemency was far removed from trial, the
process due could be minimal. The Court did not itself
decide what that process should be, but remanded to the
District Court for that purpose.

Opinion of REHNQuiST, C. J.

Finally, the Court of Appeals also agreed with respondent
that the voluntary interview procedure presented him with
a "Hobson's choice" between asserting his Fifth Amendment
rights and participating in the clemency review process, raising the specter of an unconstitutional condition. 107 F. 3d,
at 1189. There was no compelling state interest that would
justify forcing such a choice on the inmate. On the other
hand, the inmate had a measurable interest in avoiding incrimination in ongoing postconviction proceedings, as well as
with respect to possible charges for other crimes that could
be revealed during the interview. While noting some uncertainties surrounding application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the Court of Appeals concluded the doctrine
could be applied in this case.
The dissenting judge would have affirmed the District
Court's judgment. Id., at 1194. He agreed with the majority's determination that there was no protected interest
under Dumschat. But he thought that the majority's finding of a due process interest under Evitts, supra, was necessarily inconsistent with the holding and rationale of Dumschat. Evitts did not purport to overrule Dumschat. He
also concluded that respondent's Fifth Amendment claim
was too speculative, given the voluntary nature of the clemency interview. We granted certiorari, 521 U. S. 1117 (1997),
and we now reverse.
II
Respondent argues first, in disagreement with the Court
of Appeals, that there is a life interest in clemency broader
in scope than the "original" life interest adjudicated at trial
and sentencing. Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986).
This continuing life interest, it is argued, requires due process protection until respondent is executed.2 Relying on
2 Respondent alternatively tries to characterize his claim as a challenge
only to the application process conducted by the Authority, and not to
the final discretionary decision by the Governor. Brief for Respondent 8.
But, respondent still must have a protected life or liberty interest in the

280

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD
Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J.

Eighth Amendment decisions holding that additional procedural protections are required in capital cases, see, e. g., Beck
v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 637-638 (1980), respondent asserts
that Dumschat does not control the outcome in this case because it involved only a liberty interest. JUSTICE STEVENS'
dissent agrees on both counts. Post, at 291-292.
In Dumschat, an inmate claimed Connecticut's clemency
procedure violated due process because the Connecticut
Board of Pardons failed to provide an explanation for its denial of his commutation application. The Court held that
"an inmate has 'no constitutional or inherent right' to commutation of his sentence." 452 U. S., at 464. It noted that,
unlike probation decisions, "pardon and commutation decisions have not traditionally been the business of courts; as
such, they are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial
review." Ibid. The Court relied on its prior decision in
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and CorrectionalComplex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), where it rejected the claim "that a
constitutional entitlement to release [on parole] exists independently of a right explicitly conferred by the State."
Dumschat, 452 U. S., at 463-464. The individual's interest
in release or commutation " 'isindistinguishable from the
initial resistance to being confined,"' and that interest has
already been extinguished by the conviction and sentence.
Id., at 464 (quoting Greenholtz, supra, at 7). The Court
therefore concluded that a petition for commutation, like an
appeal for clemency, "is simply a unilateral hope." 452 U. S.,
at 465.
Respondent's claim of a broader due process interest in
Ohio's clemency proceedings is barred by Dumschat. The
process respondent seeks would be inconsistent with the
heart of executive clemency, which is to grant clemency as a
application process. Otherwise, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted,
he is asserting merely a protected interest in process itself, which is not
a cognizable claim. 107 F. 3d 1178, 1184 (CA6 1997); see also Olim v.
Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238, 249-250 (1983).

Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J.

matter of grace, thus allowing the executive to consider a
wide range of factors not comprehended by earlier judicial
proceedings and sentencing determinations. The dissent
agrees with respondent that because "a living person" has a
constitutionally protected life interest, it is incorrect to assert that respondent's life interest has been "extinguished."
Post, at 291. We agree that respondent maintains a residual
life interest, e. g., in not being summarily executed by prison
guards. However, as Greenholtz helps to make clear, respondent cannot use his interest in not being executed in
accord with his sentence to challenge the clemency determination by requiring the procedural protections he seeks.
442 U. S., at 7.3
The reasoning of Dumschat did not depend on the fact
that it was not a capital case. The distinctions accorded a
life interest to which respondent and the dissent point, post,
at 291-292, 293-295, are primarily relevant to trial. And
this Court has generally rejected attempts to expand any
distinctions further. See, e. g., Murray v. Giarratano,492
U. S.1, 8-9 (1989) (opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J.) (there is no
constitutional right to counsel in collateral proceedings for
death row inmates; cases recognizing special constraints on
capital proceedings have dealt with the trial stage); Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S.249, 256 (1988) (applying traditional
standard of appellate review to a Sixth Amendment claim in
a capital case); Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 538 (1986)
(applying same standard of review on federal habeas in capi5

For the same reason, respondent's reliance on Ford v. Wainwright,477
U. S. 899, 425 (1986), is misplaced. In Ford, the Court held that the
Eighth Amendment prevents the execution of a person who has become
insane since the time of trial. Id., at 410. This substantive constitutional
prohibition implicated due process protections. This protected interest,
however, arose subsequent to trial, and was separate from the life interest
already adjudicated in the inmate's conviction and sentence. See id., at
425 (Powell, J., concurring). This interest therefore had not been afforded
due process protection. The Court's recognition of a protected interest
thus did not rely on the notion of a continuing "original" life interest.

282

tal and noncapital cases); Ford, supra,at 425 (Powell, J., concurring) (noting that the Court's decisions imposing heightened requirements on capital trials and sentencing proceedings do not apply in the postconviction context).4 The
Court's analysis in Dumschat, moreover, turned not on the
fact that it was a noncapital case, but on the nature of the
benefit sought: "In terms of the Due Process Clause, a Connecticut felon's expectation that a lawfully imposed sentence
will be commuted or that he will be pardoned is no more
substantial than an inmate's expectation, for example, that
he will not be transferred to another prison; it is simply a
unilateral hope." 452 U. S., at 464 (footnote omitted). A
death row inmate's petition for clemency is also a "unilateral
hope." The defendant in effect accepts the finality of the
death sentence for purposes of adjudication,and appeals for
clemency as a matter of grace.
Respondent also asserts that, as in Greenholtz, Ohio has
created protected interests by establishing mandatory clemency application and review procedures. In Greenholtz,
supra, at 11-12, the Court held that the expectancy of
release on parole created by the mandatory language of
the Nebraska statute was entitled to some measure of constitutional protection.
Ohio's clemency procedures do not violate due process.
Despite the Authority's mandatory procedures, the ultimate
decisionmaker, the Governor, retains broad discretion.
Under any analysis, the Governor's executive discretion need
not be fettered by the types of procedural protections sought
by respondent. See Greenholtz, supra, at 12-16 (recognizing the Nebraska parole statute created a protected liberty
4The dissent provides no basis for its assertion that the special considerations afforded a capital defendant's life interest at the trial stage "apply
with special force to the final stage of the decisional process that precedes
an official deprivation of life." Post, at 295. This not only ignores our
case law to the contrary, supra, at 281 and this page, but also assumes
that executive clemency hearings are part and parcel of the judicial process preceding an execution.

Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J.

interest, yet rejecting a claim that due process necessitated
a formal parole hearing and a statement of evidence relied
upon by the parole board). There is thus no substantive expectation of clemency. Moreover, under Conner, 515 U. S.,
at 484, the availability of clemency, or the manner in which
the State conducts clemency proceedings, does not impose
"atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation
to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Ibid.; see 107 F.
3d, at 1185-1186. A denial of clemency merely means that
the inmate must serve the sentence originally imposed.
Respondent also relies on the "second strand" of due process analysis adopted by the Court of Appeals. He claims
that under the rationale of Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387
(1985), clemency is an integral part of Ohio's system of adjudicating the guilt or innocence of the defendant and is therefore entitled to due process protection. Clemency, he says,
is an integral part of the judicial system because it has historically been available as a significant remedy, its availability impacts earlier stages of the criminal justice system, and
it enhances the reliability of convictions and sentences. Respondent further suggests, as did the Sixth Circuit, that
Evitts established a due process continuum across all phases
of the judicial process.
In Evitts, the Court held that there is a constitutional
right to effective assistance of counsel on a first appeal as
of right. Id., at 396. This holding, however, was expressly
based on the combination of two lines of prior decisions.
One line of cases held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant pursuing a first appeal as of
right certain minimum safeguards necessary to make that
appeal adequate and effective, including the right to counsel.
See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S., at 20; Douglas v. California,372 U. S. 353 (1963). The second line of cases held that
the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at trial comprehended
the right to effective assistance of counsel. See Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963); Cuyler v. Sullivan,

284

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD
Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J.

446 U. S. 335, 344 (1980). These two lines of cases justified
the Court's conclusion that a criminal defendant has a right
to effective assistance of counsel on a first appeal as of right.
Evitts, supra, at 394-396.
The Court did not thereby purport to create a new
"strand" of due process analysis. And it did not rely on the
notion of a continuum of due process rights. Instead, the
Court evaluated the function and significance of a first appeal
as of right, in light of prior cases. Related decisions similarly make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every conceivable phase of the criminal system. See, e. g., Giarratano,492 U. S., at 9-10 (no due
process right to counsel for capital inmates in state postconviction proceedings); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551,
555-557 (1987) (no right to counsel in state postconviction
proceedings); Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 610-611 (1974)
(no right to counsel for discretionary appeals on direct
review).
An examination of the function and significance of the discretionary clemency decision at issue here readily shows it is
far different from the first appeal of right at issue in Evitts.
Clemency proceedings are not part of the trial-or even of
the adjudicatory process. They do not determine the guilt
or innocence of the defendant, and are not intended primarily
to enhance the reliability of the trial process. They are conducted by the executive branch, independent of direct appeal
and collateral relief proceedings. Greenholtz, 442 U. S., at
7-8. And they are usually discretionary, unlike the more
structured and limited scope of judicial proceedings. While
traditionally available to capital defendants as a final and
alternative avenue of relief, clemency has not traditionally
"been the business of courts." Dumschat,452 U. S., at 464.
Cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 411-415 (1993) (recognizing the traditional availability and significance of clemency as part of executive authority, without suggesting that
clemency proceedings are subject to judicial review); Ex

Cite as: 523 U. S. 272 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87, 120-121 (1925) (executive
clemency exists to provide relief from harshness or mistake
in the judicial system, and is therefore vested in an authority
other than the courts).
Thus, clemency proceedings are not "'an integral part of
the.., system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence
of a defendant,"' Evitts, supra, at 393 (quoting Griffin v.
Illinois, supra,at 18). Procedures mandated under the Due
Process Clause should be consistent with the nature of the
governmental power being invoked. Here, the executive's
clemency authority would cease to be a matter of grace committed to the executive authority if it were constrained by
the sort of procedural requirements that respondent urges.
Respondent is already under a sentence of death, determined
to have been lawfully imposed. If clemency is granted, he
obtains a benefit; if it is denied, he is no worse off than he
was before. 5
III
Respondent also presses on us the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the provision of a voluntary inmate interview,
without the benefit of counsel or a grant of immunity for any
statements made by the inmate, implicates the inmate's Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.
Because there is only one guaranteed clemency review, respondent asserts, his decision to participate is not truly voluntary. And in the interview he may be forced to answer
questions; or, if he remains silent, his silence may be used
against him. Respondent further asserts there is a substantial risk of incrimination since postconviction proceedings
are in progress and since he could potentially incriminate
himself on other crimes. Respondent therefore concludes
that the interview unconstitutionally conditions his assertion

to deprive a person of life. Post, at 290. That determination has already
been made with all required due process protections.

Opinion of the Court

of the right to pursue clemency on his waiver of the right to
remain silent. While the Court of Appeals accepted respondent's rubric of "unconstitutional conditions," we find it
unnecessary to address it in deciding this case. In our opinion, the procedures of the Auth6rity do not under any view
violate the Fifth Amendment privilege.
The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled selfincrimination. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308,
316-318 (1976). The record itself does not tell us what, if
any, use is made by the board of the clemency interview, or
of an inmate's refusal to answer questions posed to him at
that interview. But the Authority in its brief dispels much
of the uncertainty:
"Nothing in the procedure grants clemency applicants
immunity for what they might say or makes the interview in any way confidential. Ohio has permissibly chosen not to allow the inmate to say one thing in the interview and another in a habeas petition, and no amount
of discovery will alter this feature of the procedure."
Reply Brief for Petitioners 6.
Assuming also that the Authority will draw adverse inferences from respondent's refusal to answer questions-which
it may do in a civil proceeding without offending the Fifth
Amendment, Palmigiano, supra, at 316-318-we do not
think that respondent's testimony at a clemency interview
would be "compelled" within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment. It is difficult to see how a voluntary interview
could "compel" respondent to speak. He merely faces a
choice quite similar to the sorts of choices that a criminal
defendant must make in the course of criminal proceedings, none of which has ever been held to violate the Fifth
Amendment.
Long ago we held that a defendant who took the stand in
his own defense could not claim the privilege against selfincrimination when the prosecution sought to cross-examine

Cite as: 523 U. S. 272 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

him. Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598 (1896); Brown
v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154-155 (1958). A defendant
who takes the stand in his own behalf may be impeached
by proof of prior convictions without violation of the Fifth
Amendment privilege. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 561
(1967). A defendant whose motion for acquittal at the close
of the government's case is denied must then elect whether
to stand on his motion or to put on a defense, with the
accompanying risk that in doing so he will augment the
government's case against him. McGautha v. California,
402 U. S. 183, 215 (1971). In each of these situations, there
are undoubted pressures-generated by the strength of
the government's case against him-pushing the criminal
defendant to testify. But it has never been suggested that
such pressures constitute "compulsion" for Fifth Amendment purposes.
In Williams v. Florida,399 U. S. 78 (1970), it was claimed
that Florida's requirement of advance notice of alibi from a
criminal defendant, in default of which he would be precluded from asserting the alibi defense, violated the privilege. We said:
"Nothing in such a rule requires the defendant to rely
on an alibi or prevents him from abandoning the defense;
these matters are left to his unfettered choice. That
choice must be made, but the pressures that bear on his
pretrial decision are of the same nature as those that
would induce him to call alibi witnesses at the trial: the
force of historical fact beyond both his and the State's
control and the strength of the State's case built on
these facts. Response to that kind of pressure by offering evidence or testimony is not compelled selfincrimination transgressing the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments." Id., at 84-85 (footnote omitted).
Here, respondent has the same choice of providing information to the Authority-at the risk of damaging his case for

288

Opinion of O'CONNoR, J.

clemency or for postconviction relief-or of remaining silent.
But this pressure to speak in the hope of improving his
chance of being granted clemency does not make the interview compelled. We therefore hold that the Ohio clemency
interview, even on assumptions most favorable to respondent's claim, does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege
against compelled self-incrimination.
IV
We hold that neither the Due Process Clause nor the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is violated
by Ohio's clemency proceedings. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is therefore
Reversed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in part and

concurring in the judgment.
A prisoner under a death sentence remains a living person
and consequently has an interest in his life. The question
this case raises is the issue of what process is constitutionally
necessary to protect that interest in the context of Ohio's
clemency procedures. It is clear that "once society has validly convicted an individual of a crime and therefore established its right to punish, the demands of due process are
reduced accordingly." Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399,
429 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in result in part and

dissenting in part). I do not, however, agree with the suggestion in the principal opinion that, because clemency is
committed to the discretion of the executive, the Due Process Clause provides no constitutional safeguards. THE
CHIEF JUSTICE'S reasoning rests on our decisions in Connect-

icut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458 (1981), and
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and CorrectionalComplex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979). In those cases, the Court found that
an inmate seeking commutation of a life sentence or discre-

Cite as: 523 U. S. 272 (1998)
Opinion of O'CoNNOR, J.

tionary parole had no protected liberty interest in release
from lawful confinement. When a person has been fairly
convicted and sentenced, his liberty interest, in being free
from such confinement, has been extinguished. But it is incorrect, as JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent notes, to say that a
prisoner has been deprived of all interest in his life before
his execution. See post, at 291-292. Thus, although it is
true that "pardon and commutation decisions have not traditionally been the business of courts," Dumschat, supra, at
464, and that the decision whether to grant clemency is entrusted to the Governor under Ohio law, I believe that the
Court of Appeals correctly concluded that some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings. Judicial
intervention might, for example, be warranted in the face of
a scheme whereby a state official flipped a coin to determine
whether to grant clemency, or in a case where the State arbitrarily denied a prisoner any access to its clemency process.
In my view, however, a remand to permit the District
Court to address respondent's specific allegations of due
process violations is not required. The Ohio Death Penalty
Clemency Procedure provides that, if a stay has not yet issued, the parole board must schedule a clemency hearing 45
days before an execution for a date approximately 21 days
in advance of the execution. The board must also advise the
prisoner that he is entitled to a prehearing interview with
one or more parole board members. Although the Ohio
Adult Parole Authority complied with those instructions
here, respondent raises several objections to the process afforded him. He contends that 3 days' notice of his interview
and 10 days' notice of the hearing were inadequate; that he
did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare his clemency application because postconviction proceedings were
pending; that his counsel was improperly excluded from the
interview and permitted to participate in the hearing only
at the discretion of the parole board chair; and that he was
precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evi-

290

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

dence at the hearing. I do not believe that any of these
allegations amounts to a due process violation. The process
respondent received, including notice of the hearing and
an opportunity to participate in an interview, comports
with Ohio's regulations and observes whatever limitations
the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings. Moreover, I agree that the voluntary inmate interview that forms part of Ohio's process did not violate
respondent's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
Accordingly, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion
and concur in the judgment.
concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine
whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row
inmates-in other words, whether the State shall deprive
that person of life-does it have an obligation to comply with
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? In
my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to
that question. It expressly provides that no State has the
power to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law."
Without deciding what "minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible," procedural safeguards are required in clemency
proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the
basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohio's procedures meet the
"minimal" requirements of due process.' In Part II of his
opinion today, however, THE CHIEF JUSTICE takes a different view-essentially concluding that a clemency proceeding
could never violate the Due Process Clause. Thus, under
such reasoning, even procedures infected by bribery, perJUSTICE STEVENS,

1107 F. 3d 1178, 1187-1188 (CA6 1997).

Cite as: 523 U. S. 272 (1998)
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

sonal or political animosity, or the deliberate fabrication of
false evidence would be constitutionally acceptable. Like
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, I respectfully disagree with that
conclusion.
I
The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our
attention to state action that may "deprive" a person of life,
liberty, or property. When we are evaluating claims that
the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action
adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.
Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no
"liberty interest" in the place where he is confined, Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), or that an at-will employee has no "property interest" in his job, Bishop v. Wood,
426 U. S. 341 (1976). There is, however, no room for legitimate debate about whether a living person has a constitutionally protected interest in life. He obviously does.
Nor does Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452
U. S. 458 (1981), counsel a different conclusion. In that case
the Court held that a refusal to commute a prison inmate's
life sentence was not a deprivation of his liberty because the
liberty interest at stake had already been extinguished. Id.,
at 461, 464. The holding was supported by the "crucial distinction between being deprived of a liberty one has, as in
parole, and being denied a conditional liberty one desires."
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and CorrectionalComplex, 442 U. S. 1, 9 (1979).2 That "crucial distinction" points
2

"Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt: 'There is no

constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally
released before the expiration of a valid sentence. The natural desire of

an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance
to being confined. But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards,
has extinguished that liberty right: "[Gliven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty."' 442
U. S., at7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted). Greenholtz pointedly dis-

292

OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY v. WOODARD
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is
contesting the State's decision to deprive him of life that he
still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.
Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life
interest protected by the Due Process Clause.
II
There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due
process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most
basic elements of fair procedure are required. Presumably
a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing
entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of
appeals for mercy. Nevertheless, there are equally valid
reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review. I think, for example,
that no one would contend that a Governor could ignore the
commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency. Our cases also support the conclusion that
if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part
of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a
person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due
Process Clause.
Even if a State has no constitutional obligation to grant
criminal defendants a right to appeal, when it does establish
appellate courts, the procedures employed by those courts
must satisfy the Due Process Clause. Evitts v. Lucey, 469
U. S. 387, 396 (1985). Likewise, even if a State has no duty
to authorize parole or probation, if it does exercise its discretinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that
there is a 'critical' difference between denial of a prisoner's request for
initial release on parole and revocation of a parolee's conditional liberty.
Id., at 9-11, quoting, inter alia, Friendly, 'Some Kind of Hearing,' 123
U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1296 (1975)." Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S.458, 464 (1981) (footnote omitted).

tion to grant conditional liberty to convicted felons, any decision to deprive a parolee or a probationer of such conditional
liberty must accord that person due process. Morrissey v.
Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480-490 (1972); Gagnon v. Scarpelli,
411 U. S. 778, 781-782 (1973). Similarly, if a State establishes postconviction proceedings, these proceedings must
3
comport with due process.
The interest in life that is at stake in this case warrants
even greater protection than the interests in liberty at stake
in those cases. 4 For "death is a different kind of punishment

While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g.,
Pennsylvaniav. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555-557 (1987), we have never held
or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings. Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the State's postconviction proceedings comported with the "fundamental fairness mandated by the Due
Process Clause." Id., at 556-557; see also Murray v. Giarratano,492
U. S. 1, 8 (1989) (opinion of REHNQUST, C. J.) C"'[Tihe fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate
supply a lawyer"' (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)). THE CmEF JUSTICE, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases 'make clear
that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every...
phase of the criminal system," ante, at 284; instead, these cases simply
turned on what process is due. If there could be any question whether
state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections,
our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 484 U.S. 211, 217-218 (1988),
makes it clear that they are.

play in the decision whether to deprive a person of life. Herrerav. Collins, 506 U. S.390, 411-417 (1993). Indeed, every one of the 38 States

society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one

decisional process that precedes an official deprivation of life.
Accordingly, while I join Part III of the Court's opinion,
I cannot accept the reasoning or the conclusion in Part II.
Because this case comes to us in an interlocutory posture, I
agree with the Court of Appeals that the case should be
remanded to the District Court, "in light of relevant evidentiary materials submitted by the parties," 5 for a determination whether Ohio's procedures meet the minimum
requirements of due process.
