AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
CONNECTICUT ET AL. v. DOEHR
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 90-143.

Argued January 7, 1991-Decided June 6, 1991

A Connecticut statute authorizes a judge to allow the prejudgment attachment of real estate without prior notice or hearing upon the plaintiff's
verification that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of his or
her claim. Petitioner DiGiovanni applied to the State Superior Court
for such an attachment on respondent Doehr's home in conjunction with
a civil action for assault and battery that he was seeking to institute
against Doehr in the same court. The application was supported by an
affidavit in which DiGiovanni, in five one-sentence paragraphs, stated
that the facts set forth in his previously submitted complaint were true;
declared that the assault by Doehr resulted in particular injuries requiring expenditures for medical care; and stated his "opinion" that the foregoing facts were sufficient to establish probable cause. On the strength
of these submissions, the judge found probable cause and ordered the attachment. Only after the sheriff attached the property did Doehr receive notice of the attachment, which informed him of his right to a
postattachment hearing. Rather than pursue this option, he filed a suit
in the Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court upheld the
statute, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statute
violated due process because, inter alia, it permitted ex parte attachment absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances, see, e. g., Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U. S. 600, and the nature of the issues at
stake in this case increased the risk that attachment was wrongfully

assault are complicated matters that do not easily lend themselves to

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
898 ,F. 2d 852, affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to

Parts 1, 11, and III, concluding that:
1. Determining what process must be afforded by a state statute enabling an individual to enlist the State's aid to deprive another of his or
her property by means of a prejudgment attachment or similar procedure requires (1) consideration of the private interest that will be
affected by the prejudgment measure; (2) an examination of the risk of
erroneous deprivation through the procedures under attack and the probable value of additional or alternative safeguards; and (3) principal attention to the interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy, with
due regard for any ancillary interest the government may have in providing the procedure or forgoing the added burden of providing greater
protections. Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335. Pp. 9-11.
2. Application of the Mathews factors demonstrates that the Connecticut statute, as applied to this case, violates due process by authorizing
prejudgment attachment without prior notice and a hearing. Pp. 11-18.
(a) The interests affected are significant for a property owner like
Doehr, since attachment ordinarily clouds title; impairs the ability to sell
or otherwise alienate the property; taints any credit rating; reduces the
chance of obtaining a home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can
even place an existing mortgage in technical default where there is an
insecurity clause. That these effects do not amount to a complete, physical, or permanent deprivation of real property is irrelevant, since even
the temporary or partial impairments to property rights that such encumbrances entail are sufficient to merit due process protection. See, e. g.,
Peraltav. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U. S. 80, 85. Pp. 11-12.
(b) Without preattachment notice and a hearing, the risk of erroneous deprivation that the State permits here is too great to satisfy due
process under any of the interpretations of the statutory "probable
cause" requirement offered by the parties. If the statute merely demands inquiry into the sufficiency of the complaint, or, still less, the
plaintiff's good-faith belief that the complaint is sufficient, the judge
could authorize deprivation of the defendant's property when the claim
would fail to convince a jury, when it rested on factual allegations that
were sufficient to state a cause of action but which the defendant would
dispute, or in the case of a good-faith standard, even when the complaint
failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Even if the

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
Syllabus
provision requires a finding of probable cause to believe that judgment
will be rendered in the plaintiff's favor, the reviewing judge in a case like
this could make no realistic assessment based on the plaintiff's one-sided,
self-serving, and conclusory affidavit and complaint, particularly since
the issue does not concern ordinarily uncomplicated matters like the existence of a debt or delinquent payments that lend themselves to documentary proof. See Mitchell, supra,at 609. Moreover, the safeguards
that the State does afford-an "expeditious" postattachment notice and
an adversary hearing, judicial review of an adverse decision, and a double damages action if the original suit is commenced without probable
cause-do not adequately reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation under
Mitchell, since none of the additional factors that diminished the need for
a predeprivation hearing in that case-that the plaintiff had a vendor's
lien to protect, that the likelihood of recovery involved uncomplicated,
documentable matters, and that the plaintiff was required to post a
bond-is present here. Although a later hearing might negate the presence of probable cause, this would not cure the temporary deprivation
that an earlier hearing might have prevented. Pp. 12-15.
(c) The interests in favor of an ex parte attachment, particularly.
DiGiovanni's interests, are too minimal to justify the burdening of
Doehr's ownership rights without a hearing to determine the' likelihood
of recovery. Although DiGiovanni had no existing interest in Doehr's
real estate when he sought the attachment, and his only interest was to
ensure the availability of assets to satisfy his judgment if he prevailed on
the merits of his action, there were no allegations that Doehr was about
to transfer or encumber his real estate or take any other action during
the pendency of the suit that would render his property unavailable to
satisfy a judgment. Absent such allegations, there was no exigent circumstance permitting the postponement of notice or hearing until after
the attachment was effected. Moreover, the State's substantive interest in protecting DiGiovanni's de minimis rights cannot be any more
weighty than those rights themselves, and the State cannot seriously
plead additional financial or administrative burdens involving predeprivation hearings when it already claims to provide an immediate postdeprivation hearing. P. 16.
3. Historical and contemporary practices support the foregoing analysis. Attachment measures in both England and this country have traditionally had several limitations that reduced the risk of erroneous
deprivation, including requirements that the defendant had taken or
threatened some action that would place satisfaction of the plaintiff's
potential award in jeopardy, that the plaintiff be a creditor, as opposed
to the victim of a tort, and that the plaintiff post a bond. Moreover, a
survey of current state attachment provisions reveals that nearly every

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

State requires either a preattachment hearing, a showing of some exigent circumstance, or both, before permitting an attachment to take
place. Although the States for the most part no longer confine attachments to creditor claims, this development only increases the importance
of the other limitations. Pp. 16-18.

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
Opinion of the Court

I
On March 15, 1988, petitioner John F. DiGiovanni submit-

ted an application to the Connecticut Superior Court for an
attachment in the amount of $75,000 on respondent Brian K.
Doehr's home in Meriden, Connecticut. DiGiovanni took
this step in conjunction with a civil action for assault and
battery that he was seeking to institute against Doehr in
the same court. The suit did not involve Doehr's real estate,

nor did DiGiovanni have any pre-existing interest either in
Doehr's home or any of his other property.
Connecticut law authorizes prejudgment attachment of
real estate without affording prior notice or the opportunity
for a prior hearing to the individual whose property is subject
to the attachment. The State's prejudgment remedy statute
provides, in relevant part:

"The court or a judge of the court may allow the prejudgment remedy to be issued by an attorney without
hearing as provided in sections 52-278c and 52--278d
upon verification by oath of the plaintiff or of some competent affiant, that there is probable cause to sustain
the validity of the plaintiff's claims and (1) that the prejudgment remedy requested is for an attachment of real
property . . . ." Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-278e (1991). 1
The complete text of § 52-278e reads:
"Allowance of prejudgment remedy without hearing. Notice to defendant. Subsequent hearing and order. Attachment of real property of
municipal officers. (a) The court or a judge of the court may allow the
prejudgment remedy to be issued by an attorney without hearing as provided in sections 52-278c and 52-278d upon verification by oath of the
plaintiff or of some competent affiant, that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claim and (1) that the prejudgment remedy requested is for an attachment of real property; or (2) that there is reasonable likelihood that the defendant (A) neither resides in nor maintains
an office or place of business in this state and is not otherwise subject to
jurisdiction over his person by the court, or (B) has hidden or will hide himself so that process cannot be served on him or (C) is about to remove himself or his property from this state or (D) is about to fraudulently dispose of

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

The statute does not require the plaintiff to post a bond to
insure the payment of damages that the defendant may suffer
should the attachment prove wrongfully issued or the claim
prove unsuccessful.
As required, DiGiovanni submitted an affidavit in support
of his application. In five one-sentence paragraphs, DiGiovanni stated that the facts set forth in his previously submitted complaint were true; that "I was willfully, wantonly and
maliciously assaulted by the defendant, Brian K. Doehr";
that "[s]aid assault and battery broke my left wrist and further caused an ecchymosis to my right eye, as well as other
injuries"; and that "I have further expended sums of money
or has fraudulently disposed of any of his property with intent to hinder,
delay or defraud his creditors or (E) has fraudulently hidden or withheld
money, property or effects which should be liable to the satisfaction of his
debts or (F) has stated he is insolvent or has stated he is unable to pay his
debts as they mature.
"(b) If a prejudgment remedy is granted pursuant to this section, the
plaintiff shall include in the process served on the defendant the following
notice prepared by the plaintiff: YOU HAVE RIGHTS SPECIFIED IN
THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES, INCLUDING CHAPTER 903a, WHICH YOU MAY WISH TO EXERCISE CONCERNING
THIS PREJUDGMENT REMEDY.
THESE RIGHTS INCLUDE:
(1) THE RIGHT TO A HEARING TO OBJECT TO THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY FOR LACK OF PROBABLE CAUSE TO SUSTAIN
THE CLAIM; (2) THE RIGHT TO A HEARING TO REQUEST THAT
THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY BE MODIFIED, VACATED OR DISMISSED OR THAT A BOND BE SUBSTITUTED; AND (3) THE
RIGHT TO A HEARING AS TO ANY PORTION OF THE PROPERTY
ATTACHED WHICH YOU CLAIM IS EXEMPT FROM EXECUTION.
"(c) The defendant appearing in such action may move to dissolve or
modify the prejudgment remedy granted pursuant to this section in which
event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion expeditiously. If the court determines at such hearing requested by the defendant that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's
claim, then the prejudgment remedy granted shall remain in effect. If the
court determines there is no such probable cause, the prejudgment remedy
shall be dissolved. An order shall be issued by the court setting forth the
action it has taken."

for medical care and treatment." App. 24A. The affidavit
concluded with the statement, "In my opinion, the foregoing
facts are sufficient to show that there is probable cause that
judgment will be rendered for the plaintiff." Ibid.
On the strength of these submissions the Superior Court
Judge, by an order dated March 17, found "probable cause to
sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claim" and ordered the
attachment on Doehr's home "to the value of $75,000." The
sheriff attached the property four days later, on March 21.
Only after this did Doehr receive notice of the attachment.
He also had yet to be served with the complaint, which is
ordinarily necessary for an action to commence in Connecticut. Young v. Margiotta, 136 Conn. 429, 433, 71 A. 2d 924,
926 (1950). As the statute further required, the attachment
notice informed Doehr that he had the right to a hearing:
(1) to claim that no probable cause existed to sustain the
claim; (2) to request that the attachment be vacated, modified, or dismissed or that a bond be substituted; or (3) to
claim that some portion of the property was exempt from
execution. Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-278e(b) (1991).
Rather than pursue these options, Doehr filed suit against
DiGiovanni in Federal District Court, claiming that § 52-278e
(a)(1) was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.2 The District Court upheld
the statute and granted summary judgment in favor of DiGiovanni. Pinsky v. Duncan, 716 F. Supp. 58 (Conn. 1989).
On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. Pinsky v. Duncan,
898 F. 2d 852 (1990).' Judge Pratt, who wrote the opinion
'Three other plaintiffs joined Doehr, challenging § 52-278e(a)(1) out of
separate instances of attachment by different defendants. These other
plaintiffs and defendants did not participate in the Court of Appeals and
are no longer parties in this case.
'The Court of Appeals invited Connecticut to intervene pursuant to 28
U. S. C. § 2403(b) after oral argument. The State elected to intervene in
the appeal and has fully participated in the proceedings before this Court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1990

for the court, concluded that the Connecticut statute violated
due process in permitting ex parte attachment absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances. "The rule to be derived
from Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395
U. S. 337 (1969), and its progeny, therefore, is not that postattachment hearings are generally acceptable provided that
plaintiff files a factual affidavit and that a judicial officer supervises the process, but that a prior hearing may be postponed where exceptional circumstances justify such a delay,
and where sufficient additional safeguards are present."
Id., at 855. This conclusion was deemed to be consistent
with our decision in Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U. S.
600 (1974), because the absence of a preattachment hearing
was approved in that case based on the presence of extraordinary circumstances.
A further reason to invalidate the statute, the court ruled,
was the highly factual nature of the issues in this case. In
Mitchell, there were "uncomplicated matters that len[t]
themselves to documentary proof" and "[tihe nature of the
issues at stake minimize[d] the risk that the writ [would] be
wrongfully issued by a judge." Id., at 609-610. Similarly,
in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 343-344 (1976), where
an evidentiary hearing was not required prior to the termination of disability benefits, the determination of disability was
"sharply focused and easily documented." Judge Pratt observed that in contrast the present case involved the factspecific event of a fist fight and the issue of assault. He
doubted that the judge could reliably determine probable
cause when presented with only the plaintiff's version of the
altercation. "Because the risk of a wrongful attachment is
considerable under these circumstances, we conclude that
dispensing with notice and opportunity for a hearing until
after the attachment, without a showing of extraordinary circumstances, violates the requirements of due process." 898
F. 2d, at 856. Judge Pratt went on to conclude that in his
view, the statute was also constitutionally infirm for its fail-

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
1

Opinion of the Court

ure to require the plaintiff to post a bond for the protection of
the defendant in the event the attachment was ultimately
found to have been improvident.
Judge Mahoney was also of the opinion that the statutory
provision for attaching real property in civil actions, without
a prior hearing and in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, was unconstitutional. He disagreed with Judge
Pratt's opinion that a bond was constitutionally required.
Judge Newman dissented from the holding that a hearing
prior to attachment was constitutionally required and, like
Judge Mahoney, disagreed with Judge Pratt on the necessity
for a bond.
The dissent's conclusion accorded with the views of the
Connecticut Supreme Court, which had previously upheld
§ 52-278e(b) in Fermont Division, Dynamics Corp. of
America v. Smith, 178 Conn. 393, 423 A. 2d 80 (1979). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority. 498
U. S. 809 (1990).
II
With this case we return to the question of what process
must be afforded by a state statute enabling an individual to
enlist the aid of the State to deprive another of his or her
property by means of the prejudgment attachment or similar
procedure. Our cases reflect the numerous variations this
type of remedy can entail. In Sniadach v. Family Finance
Corp. of Bay View, 395 U. S. 337 (1969), the Court struck
down a Wisconsin statute that permitted a creditor to effect
prejudgment garnishment of wages without notice and prior
hearing to the wage earner. In Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S.
67 (1972), the Court likewise found a due process violation
in state replevin provisions that permitted vendors to have
goods seized through an ex parte application to a court clerk
and the posting of a bond. Conversely, the Court upheld a
Louisiana ex parte procedure allowing a lienholder to have
disputed goods sequestered in Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co.,
supra. Mitchell, however, carefully noted that Fuentes was

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

decided against "a factual and legal background sufficiently
different ...

that it does not require the invalidation of the

Louisiana sequestration statute." Id., at 615. Those differences included Louisiana's provision of an immediate postdeprivation hearing along with the option of damages; the
requirement that a judge rather than a clerk determine that
there is a clear showing of entitlement to the writ; the necessity for a detailed affidavit; and an emphasis on the lienholder's interest in preventing waste or alienation of the
encumbered property. Id., at 615-618. In North Georgia
Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U. S. 601 (1975), the
Court again invalidated an ex parte garnishment statute that
not only failed to provide for notice and prior hearing but also
failed to require a bond, a detailed affidavit setting out the
claim, the determination of a neutral magistrate, or a prompt
postdeprivation hearing. Id., at 606-608.
These cases "underscore the truism that '"[d]ue process,"
unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a
fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances."'
Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, at 334 (quoting Cafeteria &
Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 895 (1961)).
In Mathews, we drew upon our prejudgment remedy decisions to determine what process is due when the government
itself seeks to effect a deprivation on its own initiative. 424
U. S., at 334. That analysis resulted in the now familiar
threefold inquiry requiring consideration of "the private interest that will be affected by the official action"; "the risk of
an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or
substitute safeguards"; and lastly "the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural
requirement would entail." Id., at 335.
Here the inquiry is similar, but the focus is different. Prejudgment remedy statutes ordinarily apply to disputes between private parties rather than between an individual and

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
1

Opinion of the Court

the government. Such enactments are designed to enable
one of the parties to "make use of state procedures with the
overt, significant assistance of state officials," and they
undoubtedly involve state action "substantial enough to
implicate the Due Process Clause."
Tulsa Professional
Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478, 486 (1988).
Nonetheless, any burden that increasing procedural safeguards entails primarily affects not the government, but the
party seeking control of the other's property. See Fuentes
v. Shevin, supra, at 99-101 (WHITE, J., dissenting). For
this type of case, therefore, the relevant inquiry requires,
as in Mathews, first, consideration of the private interest
that will be affected by the prejudgment measure; second, an
examination of the risk of erroneous deprivation through the
procedures under attack and the probable value of additional
or alternative safeguards; and third, in contrast to Mathews,
principal attention to the interest of the party seeking the
prejudgment remedy, with, nonetheless, due regard for any
ancillary interest the government may have in providing the
procedure or forgoing the added burden of providing greater
protections.
We now consider the Mathews factors in determining the
adequacy of the procedures before us, first with regard to the
safeguards of notice and a prior hearing, and then in relation
to the protection of a bond.
III
We agree with the Court of Appeals that the property interests that attachment affects are significant. For a property owner like Doehr, attachment ordinarily clouds title; impairs the ability to sell or otherwise alienate the property;
taints any credit rating; reduces the chance of obtaining a
home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can even place
an existing mortgage in technical default where there is an
insecurity clause. Nor does Connecticut deny that any of
these consequences occurs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

Instead, the State correctly points out that these effects do
not amount to a complete, physical, or permanent deprivation
of real property; their impact is less than the perhaps temporary total deprivation of household goods or wages. See
Sniadach, supra, at 340; Mitchell, 416 U. S., at 613. But
the Court has never held that only such extreme deprivations
trigger due process concern. See Buchanan v. Warley, 245
U. S. 60, 74 (1917). To the contrary, our cases show that
even the temporary or partial impairments to property rights
that attachments, liens, and similar encumbrances entail are
sufficient to merit due process protection. Without doubt,
state procedures for creating and enforcing attachments, as
with liens, "are subject to the strictures of due process."
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U. S. 80, 85
(1988) (citing Mitchell, supra, at 604; Hodge v. Muscatine
County, 196 U. S. 276, 281 (1905)).1
We also agree with the Court of Appeals that the risk
of erroneous deprivation that the State permits here is substantial. By definition, attachment statutes premise a deprivation of property on one ultimate factual contingency-the
award of damages to the plaintiff which the defendant may
not be able to satisfy. See Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U. S. 94,
104-105 (1921); R. Thompson & J. Sebert, Remedies: Damages, Equity and Restitution § 5.01 (1983). For attachments
4

Our summary affirmance in Spielman-Fond, Inc. v. Hanson's, Inc.,
417 U. S. 901 (1974), does not control. In Spielman-Fond, the District
Court held that the filing of a mechanic's lien did not amount to the taking
of a significant property interest. 379 F. Supp. 997, 999 (Ariz. 1973)
(three-judge court) (per curiam). A summary disposition does not enjoy
the full precedential value of a case argued on the merits and disposed of by
a written opinion. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 (1974). The
facts of Spielman-Fond presented an alternative basis for affirmance in
any event. Unlike the case before us, the mechanic's lien statute in
Spielman-Fondrequired the creditor to have a pre-existing interest in the
property at issue. 379 F. Supp., at 997. As we explain below, a heightened plaintiff interest in certain circumstances can provide a ground for upholding procedures that are otherwise suspect. Infra, at 15.

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
1

Opinion of the Court

before judgment, Connecticut mandates that this determination be made by means of a procedural inquiry that asks
whether "there is probable cause to sustain the validity of
the plaintiff's claim." Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-278e(a) (1991).
The statute elsewhere defines the validity of the claim in
terms of the likelihood "that judgment will be rendered in
the matter in favor of the plaintiff." Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52278c(a)(2) (1991); Ledgebrook Condominium Assn. v. Lusk
Corp., 172 Conn. 577, 584, 376 A. 2d 60, 63-64 (1977). What
probable cause means in this context, however, remains obscure. The State initially took the position, as did the dissent below, that the statute requires a plaintiff to show the
objective likelihood of the suit's success. Brief for Petitioners 12; Pinsky, 898 F. 2d, at 861-862 (Newman, J., dissenting). Doehr, citing ambiguous state cases, reads the provision as requiring no more than that a plaintiff demonstrate a
subjective good-faith belief that the suit will succeed. Brief
for Respondent 25-26. Ledgebrook Condominium Assn.,
supra, at 584, 376 A. 2d, at 63-64; Anderson v. Nedovich, 19
Conn. App. 85, 88, 561 A. 2d 948, 949 (1989). At oral argument, the State shifted its position to argue that the statute
requires something akin to the plaintiff stating a claim with
sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss.
We need not resolve this confusion since the statute presents too great a risk of erroneous deprivation under any of
these interpretations. If the statute demands inquiry into
the sufficiency of the complaint, or, still less, the plaintiff's
good-faith belief that the complaint is sufficient, requirement
of a complaint and a factual affidavit would permit a court to
make these minimal determinations. But neither inquiry adequately reduces the risk of erroneous deprivation. Permitting a court to authorize attachment merely because the
plaintiff believes the defendant is liable, or because the plaintiff can make out a facially valid complaint, would permit the
deprivation of the defendant's property when the claim would
fail to convince a jury, when it rested on factual allegations

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

that were sufficient to state a cause of action but which the
defendant would dispute, or in the case of a mere good-faith
standard, even when the complaint failed to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted. The potential for unwarranted attachment in these situations is self-evident and
too great to satisfy the requirements of due process absent
any countervailing consideration.
Even if the provision requires the plaintiff to demonstrate,
and the judge to find, probable cause to believe that judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the risk of
error was substantial in this case. As the record shows, and
as the State concedes, only a skeletal affidavit need be, and
was, filed. The State urges that the reviewing judge normally reviews the complaint as well, but concedes that the
complaint may also be conclusory. It is self-evident that the
judge could make no realistic assessment concerning the likelihood of an action's success based upon these one-sided, selfserving, and conclusory submissions. And as the Court of
Appeals said, in a case like this involving an alleged assault,
even a detailed affidavit would give only the plaintiff's version of the confrontation. Unlike determining the existence
of a debt or delinquent payments, the issue does not concern
"ordinarily uncomplicated matters that lend themselves to
documentary proof." Mitchell, 416 U. S., at 609. The likelihood of error that results illustrates that "fairness can
rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts
decisive of rights ....
[And n]o better instrument has been
devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy
of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity
to meet it." Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath,
341 U. S. 123, 170-172 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
What safeguards the State does afford do not adequately
reduce this risk. Connecticut points out that the statute also
provides an "expeditiou[s]" postattachment adversary hear-

ing, § 52-278e(c);5 notice for such a hearing, § 52-278e(b);
judicial review of an adverse decision, § 52-2781(a); and a double damages action if the original suit is commenced without
probable cause, § 52-568(a)(1). Similar considerations were
present in Mitchell, where we upheld Louisiana's sequestration statute despite the lack of predeprivation notice and
hearing. But in Mitchell, the plaintiff had a vendor's lien to
protect, the risk of error was minimal because the likelihood
of recovery involved uncomplicated matters that lent themselves to documentary proof, 416 U. S., at 609-610, and the
plaintiff was required to put up a bond. None of these factors diminishing the need for a predeprivation hearing is
present in this case. It is true that a later hearing might negate the presence of probable cause, but this would not cure
the temporary deprivation that an earlier hearing might have
prevented. "The Fourteenth Amendment draws no bright
lines around three-day, 10-day or 50-day deprivations of
property. Any significant taking of property by the State is
within the purview of the Due Process Clause." Fuentes,
407 U. S., at 86.

The parties vigorously dispute whether a defendant can in fact receive
a prompt hearing. Doehr contends that the State's rules of practice prevent the filing of any motion-including a motion for the mandated postattachment hearing-until the return date on the complaint, which in this
case was 30 days after service. Connecticut Practice Book § 114 (1988).
Under state law at least 12 days must elapse between service on the defendant and the return date. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-46 (1991). The State
counters that the postattachment hearing is available upon request. See
Fermont Division, Dynamics Corp. of America v. Smith, 178 Conn. 393,
397-398, 423 A. 2d 80, 83 (1979) ("Most important, the statute affords to
the defendant whose property has been attached the opportunity to obtain
an immediate postseizure hearing at which the prejudgment remedy will
be dissolved unless the moving party proves probable cause to sustain the
validity of his claim"). We assume, without deciding, that the hearing is
prompt. Even on this assumption, the State's procedures fail to provide
adequate safeguards against the erroneous deprivation of the property interest at stake.

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

501 U. S.

Finally, we conclude that the interests in favor of an ex
parte attachment, particularly the interests of the plaintiff,
are too minimal to supply such a consideration here. The
plaintiff had no existing interest in Doehr's real estate when
he sought the attachment. His only interest in attaching the
property was to ensure the availability of assets to satisfy his
judgment if he prevailed on the merits of his action. Yet
there was no allegation that Doehr was about to transfer or
encumber his real estate or take any other action during the
pendency of the action that would render his real estate unavailable to satisfy a judgment. Our cases have recognized
such a properly supported claim would be an exigent circumstance permitting postponing any notice or hearing until after
the attachment is effected. See Mitchell, supra, at 609; Fuentes, supra, at 90-92; Sniadach, 395 U. S., at 339. Absent
such allegations, however, the plaintiff's interest in attaching
the property does not justify the burdening of Doehr's ownership rights without a hearing to determine the likelihood of
recovery.
No interest the government may have affects the analysis.
The State's substantive interest in protecting any rights of
the plaintiff cannot be any more weighty than those rights
themselves. Here the plaintiff's interest is de minimis.
Moreover, the State cannot seriously plead additional financial or administrative burdens involving predeprivation hearings when it already claims to provide an immediate postdeprivation hearing. Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 52-278e(b) and (c)
(1991); Fermont, 178 Conn., at 397-398, 423 A. 2d, at 83.
Historical and contemporary practices support our analysis. Prejudgment attachment is a remedy unknown at common law. Instead, "it traces its origin to the Custom of London, under which a creditor might attach money or goods of
the defendant either in the plaintiff's own hands or in the custody of a third person, by proceedings in the mayor's court or
in the sheriff's court." Ownbey, 256 U. S., at 104. Generally speaking, attachment measures in both England and this

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
Opinion of the Court

country had several limitations that reduced the risk of erroneous deprivation which Connecticut permits. Although attachments ordinarily did not require prior notice or a hearing, they were usually authorized only where the defendant
had taken or threatened to take some action that would place
the satisfaction of the plaintiff's potential award in jeopardy.
See C. Drake, Law of Suits by Attachment, §§ 40-82 (1866)
(hereinafter Drake); 1 R. Shinn, Attachment and Garnishment § 86 (1896) (hereinafter Shinn). Attachments, moreover, were generally confined to claims by creditors. Drake
§§ 9-10; Shinn § 12. As we and the Court of Appeals have
noted, disputes between debtors and creditors more readily
lend themselves to accurate ex parte assessments of the merits. Tort actions, like the assault and battery claim at issue
here, do not. See Mitchell, supra, at 609-610. Finally, as
we will discuss below, attachment statutes historically required that the plaintiff post a bond. Drake §§ 114-183;
Shinn § 153.
Connecticut's statute appears even more suspect in light of
current practice. A survey of state attachment provisions reveals that nearly every State requires either a preattachment
hearing, a showing of some exigent circumstance, or both, before permitting an attachment to take place. See Appendix
to this opinion. Twenty-seven States, as well as the District
of Columbia, permit attachments only when some extraordinary circumstance is present. In such cases, preattachment
hearings are not required but postattachment hearings are
provided. Ten States permit attachment without the presence of such factors but require prewrit hearings unless one
of those factors is shown. Six States limit attachments to
extraordinary circumstance cases, but the writ will not issue
prior to a hearing unless there is a showing of some even
more compelling condition.6 Three States always require a
'One State, Pennsylvania, has not had an attachment statute or rule

F. 2d 1123 (CA3 1976).

preattachment hearing. Only Washington, Connecticut, and
Rhode Island authorize attachments without a prior hearing
in situations that do not involve any purportedly heightened
threat to the plaintiff's interests. Even those States permit
ex parte deprivations only in certain types of cases: Rhode
Island does so only when the claim is equitable; Connecticut and Washington do so only when real estate is to be attached, and even Washington requires a bond. Conversely,
the States for the most part no longer confine attachments to
creditor claims. This development, however, only increases
the importance of the other limitations.
We do not mean to imply that any given exigency requirement protects an attachment from constitutional attack.
Nor do we suggest that the statutory measures we have surveyed are necessarily free of due process problems or other
constitutional infirmities in general. We do believe, however, that the procedures of almost all the States confirm our
view that the Connecticut provision before us, by failing to
provide a preattachment hearing without at least requiring a
showing of some exigent circumstance, clearly falls short of
the demands of due process.
IV
A
Although a majority of the Court does not reach the issue,
JUSTICES MARSHALL, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, and I deem it
appropriate to consider whether due process also requires
the plaintiff to post a bond or other security in addition to requiring a hearing or showing of some exigency.7
7

Ordinarily we will not address a contention advanced by a respondent
that would enlarge his or her rights under a judgment, without the respondent filing a cross-petition for certiorari. E. g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 119, n. 14 (1985). Here the Court
of Appeals rejected Doehr's argument that § 52-278e(a)(1) violates due
process in failing to mandate a preattachment bond. Nonetheless, this
case involves considerations that in the past have prompted us "to consider

the question highlighted by respondent."

Berkemer v. McCarty, 468

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
Opinion of WHITE, J.

As noted, the impairments to property rights that attachments effect merit due process protection. Several consequences can be severe, such as the default of a homeowner's
mortgage. In the present context, it need only be added
that we have repeatedly recognized the utility of a bond in
protecting property rights affected by the mistaken award
of prejudgment remedies. Di-Chem, 419 U. S., at 610, 611
(Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 619 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting); Mitchell, 416 U. S., at 606, n. 8.
Without a bond, at the time of attachment, the danger that
these property rights may be wrongfully deprived remains
unacceptably high even with such safeguards as a hearing or
exigency requirement. The need for a bond is especially apparent where extraordinary circumstances justify an attachment with no more than the plaintiff's ex parte assertion of a
claim. We have already discussed how due process tolerates, and the States generally permit, the otherwise impermissible chance of erroneously depriving the defendant in
such situations in light of the heightened interest of the plaintiff. Until a postattachment hearing, however, a defendant
has no protection against damages sustained where no extraordinary circumstance in fact existed or the plaintiff's likelihood of recovery was nil. Such protection is what a bond
can supply. Both the Court and its individual Members have
repeatedly found the requirement of a bond to play an essential role in reducing what would have been too great a degree
of risk in precisely this type of circumstance. Mitchell,
U. S. 420, 435-436, n. 23 (1984).

First, as our cases have shown, the no-

tice and hearing question and the bond question are intertwined and can
fairly be considered facets of the same general issue. Thus, "[w]ithout
undue strain, the position taken by respondent before this Court ... might
be characterized as an argument in support of the judgment below" insofar
as a discussion of notice and a hearing cannot be divorced from consideration of a bond. Ibid. Second, this aspect of prejudgment attachment
"plainly warrants our attention, and with regard to which the lower courts
are in need of guidance." Ibid. Third, "and perhaps most importantly,
both parties have briefed and argued the question." Ibid.

supra, at 610, 619; Di-Chem, 419 U. S., at 613 (Powell, J.,
concurring in judgment); id., at 619 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting); Fuentes, 407 U. S., at 101 (WHITE, J., dissenting).
But the need for a bond does not end here. A defendant's
property rights remain at undue risk even when there has
been an adversarial hearing to determine the plaintiff's likelihood of recovery. At best, a court's initial assessment
of each party's case cannot produce more than an educated
prediction as to who will win. This is especially true when,
as here, the nature of the claim makes any accurate prediction elusive. See Mitchell, supra, at 609-610. In consequence, even a full hearing under a proper probable-cause
standard would not prevent many defendants from having
title to their homes impaired during the pendency of suits
that never result in the contingency that ultimately justifies
such impairment, namely, an award to the plaintiff. Attachment measures currently on the books reflect this concern.
All but a handful of States require a plaintiff's bond despite
also affording a hearing either before, or (for the vast majority, only under extraordinary circumstances) soon after, an
attachment takes place.
See Appendix to this opinion.
Bonds have been a similarly common feature of other prejudgment remedy procedures that we have considered, whether or
not these procedures also included a hearing. See Ownbey,
256 U. S., at 101-102, n. 1; Fuentes, supra, at 73, n. 6,
75-76, n. 7, 81-82; Mitchell, supra, at 606, and n. 6; DiChem, supra, at 602-603, n. 1, 608.
The State stresses its double damages remedy for suits
that are commenced without probable cause. Conn. Gen.
Stat. § 52-568(a)(1).1 This remedy, however, fails to make
8

Section 52-568(a)(1) provides:
"Any person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or complaint against another, in his own name, or the name of others, or assertsa
defense to any civil action or complaint commenced and prosecuted by another (1) without probable cause, shall pay such other person double dam-

Opinion of WHITE, J.

up for the lack of a bond. As an initial matter, the meaning
of "probable cause" in this provision is no more clear here
than it was in the attachment provision itself. Should the
term mean the plaintiff's good faith or the facial adequacy of
the complaint, the remedy is clearly insufficient. A defendant who was deprived where there was little or no likelihood
that the plaintiff would obtain a judgment could nonetheless
recover only by proving some type of fraud or malice or by
showing that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim. Problems persist even if the plaintiff's ultimate failure permits recovery. At best a defendant must await a decision on the
merits of the plaintiff's complaint, even assuming that a § 52568(a)(1) action may be brought as a counterclaim. Hydro
Air of Connecticut, Inc. v. Versa Technologies, Inc., 99
F. R. D. 111, 113 (Conn. 1983). Settlement, under Connecticut law, precludes seeking the damages remedy, a fact that
encourages the use of attachments as a tactical device to
pressure an opponent to capitulate. Blake v. Levy, 191
Conn. 257, 464 A. 2d 52 (1983). An attorney's advice that
there is probable cause to commence an action constitutes a
complete defense, even if the advice was unsound or erroneous. Vandersluis v. Weil, 176 Conn. 353, 361, 407 A. 2d 982,
987 (1978). Finally, there is no guarantee that the original
plaintiff will have adequate assets to satisfy an award that
the defendant may win.
Nor is there any appreciable interest against a bond requirement. Section 52-278e(a)(1) does not require a plaintiff
to show exigent circumstances nor any pre-existing interest
in the property facing attachment. A party must show more
than the mere existence of a claim before subjecting an opponent to prejudgment proceedings that carry a significant risk
of erroneous deprivation. See Mitchell, supra, at 604-609;
Fuentes, supra, at 90-92; Sniadach, 395 U. S., at 339.

B
Our foregoing discussion compels the four of us to consider
whether a bond excuses the need for a hearing or other safeguards altogether. If a bond is needed to augment the protections afforded by preattachment and postattachment hearings, it arguably follows that a bond renders these safeguards
unnecessary. That conclusion is unconvincing, however, for
it ignores certain harms that bonds could not undo but that
hearings would prevent. The law concerning attachments
has rarely, if ever, required defendants to suffer an encumbered title until the case is concluded without any prior
opportunity to show that the attachment was unwarranted.
Our cases have repeatedly emphasized the importance of providing a prompt postdeprivation hearing at the very least.
Mitchell, 416 U. S., at 606; Di-Chem, 419 U. S., at 606-607.
Every State but one, moreover, expressly requires a preattachment or postattachment hearing to determine the propriety of an attachment.
The necessity for at least a prompt postattachment hearing is self-evident because the right to be compensated at
the end of the case, if the plaintiff loses, for all provable
injuries caused by the attachment is inadequate to redress
the harm inflicted, harm that could have been avoided had an
early hearing been held. An individual with an immediate
need or opportunity to sell a property can neither do so,
nor otherwise satisfy that need or recreate the opportunity.
The same applies to a parent in need of a home equity loan
for a child's education, an entrepreneur seeking to start a
business on the strength of an otherwise strong credit rating,
or simply a homeowner who might face the disruption of having a mortgage placed in technical default. The extent of
these harms, moreover, grows with the length of the suit.
Here, oral argument indicated that civil suits in Connecticut commonly take up to four to seven years for completion.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. Many state attachment statutes require

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR

Opinion of WHITE, J.

that the amount of a bond be anywhere from the equivalent
to twice the amount the plaintiff seeks. See, e. g., Utah
Rule of Civ. Proc. 64C(b). These amounts bear no relation
to the harm the defendant might suffer even assuming that
money damages can make up for the foregoing disruptions.
It should be clear, however, that such an assumption is fundamentally flawed. Reliance on a bond does not sufficiently
account for the harms that flow from an erroneous attachment to excuse a State from reducing that risk by means of a
timely hearing.
If a bond cannot serve to dispense with a hearing immediately after attachment, neither is it sufficient basis for
not providing a preattachment hearing in the absence of exigent circumstances even if in any event a hearing would be
provided a few days later. The reasons are the same: a
wrongful attachment can inflict injury that will not fully be
redressed by recovery on the bond after a prompt postattachment hearing determines that the attachment was invalid.
Once more, history and contemporary practices support
our conclusion. Historically, attachments would not issue
without a showing of extraordinary circumstances even
though a plaintiff bond was almost invariably required in addition. Drake §§ 4, 114; Shinn §§ 86, 153. Likewise, all but
eight States currently require the posting of a bond. Out of
this 42-State majority, all but one requires a preattachment
hearing, a showing of some exigency, or both, and all but one
expressly require a postattachment hearing when an attachment has been issued ex parte. See Appendix to this opinion. This testimony underscores the point that neither a
hearing nor an extraordinary circumstance limitation eliminates the need for a bond, no more than a bond allows waiver
of these other protections. To reconcile the interests of the
defendant and the plaintiff accurately, due process generally
requires all of the above.

A bond is required except in situations in which the plaintiff seeks to
attach the real property of a defendant who, after diligent efforts, cannot
be served.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, concurring in part and concurring in the

judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Connecticut attachment
statute, "as applied to this case," ante, at 4, fails to satisfy
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I
therefore join Parts I, II, and III of its opinion. Unfortunately, the remainder of the opinion does not confine itself to
the facts of this case, but enters upon a lengthy disquisition
as to what combination of safeguards are required to satisfy
due process in hypothetical cases not before the Court. I
therefore do not join Part IV.
As the Court's opinion points out, the Connecticut statute
allows attachment not merely for a creditor's claim, but for a
tort claim of assault and battery; it affords no opportunity for
a predeprivation hearing; it contains no requirement that
there be "exigent circumstances," such as an effort on the
part of the defendant to conceal assets; no bond is required
from the plaintiff; and the property attached is one in which
the plaintiff has no pre-existing interest. The Court's opin-

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
1

Opinion of

REHNQUIST, C. J.

ion is, in my view, ultimately correct when it bases its holding of unconstitutionality of the Connecticut statute as applied here on our cases of Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp.
of Bay View, 395 U. S. 337 (1969); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407
U. S. 67 (1972), Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U. S. 600
(1974), and North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc.,
419 U. S. 601 (1975). But I do not believe that the result follows so inexorably as the Court's opinion suggests. All of
the cited cases dealt with personalty-bank deposits or chattels -and each involved the physical seizure of the property
itself, so that the defendant was deprived of its use. These
cases, which represented something of a revolution in the jurisprudence of procedural due process, placed substantial
limits on the methods by which creditors could obtain a lien
on the assets of a debtor prior to judgment. But in all of
them the debtor was deprived of the use and possession of
the property. In the present case, on the other hand, Connecticut's prejudgment attachment on real property statute,
which secures an incipient lien for the plaintiff, does not deprive the defendant of the use or possession of the property.
The Court's opinion therefore breaks new ground, and I
would point out, more emphatically than the Court does, the
limits of today's holding. In Spielman-Fond, Inc. v. Hanson's, Inc., 379 F. Supp. 997, 999 (Ariz. 1973), the District
Court held that the filing of a mechanics' lien did not cause
the deprivation of a significant property interest of the
owner. We summarily affirmed that decision. 417 U. S.
901 (1974). Other courts have read this summary affirmance
to mean that the mere imposition of a lien on real property,
which does not disturb the owner's use or enjoyment of the
property, is not a deprivation of property calling for procedural due process safeguards. I agree with the Court, however, that upon analysis the deprivation here is a significant
one, even though the owner remains in undisturbed possession. "For a property owner like Doehr, attachment ordinarily clouds title; impairs the ability to sell or otherwise

OCTOBER TERM, 1990

501 U. S.

alienate the property; taints any credit rating; reduces the
chance of obtaining a home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can even place an existing mortgage in technical
default where there is an insecurity clause." Ante, at 11.
Given the elaborate system of title records relating to real
property which prevails in all of our States, a lienor need not
obtain possession or use of real property belonging to a
debtor in order to significantly impair its value to him.
But in Spielman-Fond, Inc., supra, there was, as the
Court points out, ante, at 12, n. 4, an alternative basis available to this Court for affirmance of that decision. Arizona
recognized a pre-existing lien in favor of unpaid mechanics
and materialmen who had contributed labor or supplies which
were incorporated in improvements to real property. The
existence of such a lien upon the very property ultimately
posted or noticed distinguishes those cases from the present
one, where the plaintiff had no pre-existing interest in the
real property which he sought to attach. Materialman's and
mechanic's lien statutes award an interest in real property to
workers who have contributed their labor, and to suppliers
who have furnished material, for the improvement of the real
property. Since neither the labor nor the material can be reclaimed once it has become a part of the realty, this is the
only method by which workmen or small businessmen who
have contributed to the improvement of the property may be
given a remedy against a property owner who has defaulted
on his promise to pay for the labor and the materials. To require any sort of a contested court hearing or bond before the
notice of lien takes effect would largely defeat the purpose of
these statutes.
Petitioners in their brief rely in part on our summary affirmance in Bartlett v. Williams, 464 U. S. 801 (1983). That
case involved a lis pendens, in which the question presented
to this Court was whether such a procedure could be valid
when the only protection afforded to the owner of land affected by the lis pendens was a postsequestration hearing.

CONNECTICUT v. DOEHR
1

Opinion of

REHNQUIST,

C. J.

A notice of lis pendens is a well-established, traditional remedy whereby a plaintiff (usually a judgment creditor) who
brings an action to enforce an interest in property to which
the defendant has title gives notice of the pendency of such
action to third parties; the notice causes the interest which he
establishes, if successful, to relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens. The filing of such notice will have an
effect upon the defendant's ability to alienate the property,
or to obtain additional security on the basis of title to the
property, but the effect of the lis pendens is simply to give
notice to the world of the remedy being sought in the lawsuit
itself. The lis pendens itself creates no additional right in
the property on the part of the plaintiff, but simply allows
third parties to know that a lawsuit is pending in which the
plaintiff is seeking to establish such a right. Here, too, the
fact that the plaintiff already claims an interest in the property which he seeks to enforce by a lawsuit distinguishes this
class of cases from the Connecticut attachment employed in
the present case.
Today's holding is a significant development in the law; the
only cases dealing with real property cited in the Court's
opinion, Peraltav. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U. S.
80, 85 (1988), and Hodge v. Muscatine County, 196 U. S. 276,
281 (1905), arose out of lien foreclosure sales in which the
question was whether the owner was entitled to proper notice. The change is dramatically reflected when we compare
today's decision with the almost casual statement of Justice
Holmes, writing for a unanimous Court in Coffin Brothers &
Co. v. Bennett, 277 U. S. 29, 31 (1928):
"[Nlothing is more common than to allow parties alleging
themselves to be creditors to establish in advance by attachment a lien dependent for its effect upon the result
of the suit."
The only protection accorded to the debtor in that case
was the right to contest his liability in a postdeprivation
proceeding.

OCTOBER TERM, 1990

SCALIA,

501 U. S.

It is both unwise and unnecessary, I believe, for the plurality to proceed, as it does in Part IV, from its decision of the
case before it to discuss abstract and hypothetical situations
not before it. This is especially so where we are dealing
with the Due Process Clause which, as the Court recognizes, "'"unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception
with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,""' ante, at 10. And it is even more true in a case
involving constitutional limits on the methods by which the
States may transfer or create interests in real property; in
other areas of the law, dicta may do little damage, but those
who insure titles or write title opinions often do not enjoy the
luxury of distinguishing detween dicta and holding.
The two elements of due process with which the Court concerns itself in Part IV-the requirements of a bond and of
"exigent circumstances" -prove to be upon analysis so vague
that the discussion is not only unnecessary, but not particularly useful. Unless one knows what the terms and conditions of a bond are to be, the requirement of a "bond" in the
abstract means little. The amount to be secured by the bond
and the conditions of the bond are left unaddressed -is there
to be liability on the part of a plaintiff if he is ultimately unsuccessful in the underlying lawsuit, or is it instead to be conditioned on some sort of good-faith test? The "exigent circumstances" referred to by the Court are admittedly equally
vague; nonresidency appears to be enough in some States, an
attempt to conceal assets is required in others, an effort to
flee the jurisdiction in still others. We should await concrete
cases which present questions involving bonds and exigent
circumstances before we attempt to decide when and if the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires
them as prerequisites for a lawful attachment.

Opinion of

SCALIA,

31

J.

Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 24 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment), I agree that its validity under the Due Process
Clause should be determined by applying the test we set
forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976); and I
agree that it fails that test. I join Parts I and III of the
Court's opinion, and concur in the judgment of the Court.
