Judgment and decree entered.
Opinion reported: 501 U. S. 221.

The joint motion for entry of stipulated judgment and
decree, as modified, is granted.
STIPULATED JUDGMENT, AS MODIFIED
1. New Mexico has been in violation of Article IV(b) of the
Canadian River Compact from 1987 to date.
2. Pursuant to Paragraph 8 of the Decree entered in this
case, New Mexico shall release from Ute Reservoir in 1993
sufficient water to result in an aggregate of not more than
200,000 acre-feet of conservation storage below Conchas Dam
in New Mexico, including conservation storage in the other
reservoirs subject to the limitation under Article IV(b) of
the Canadian River Compact. The release of water from
Ute Reservoir will be coordinated with Oklahoma and Texas
and will be at the call of Texas.
3. New Mexico shall also release from Ute Reservoir an
additional 25,000 acre-feet of storage below the Article IV(b)
limitation. New Mexico shall operate Ute Reservoir
through the year 2002 at or below the elevations set forth in
the schedule below and in accordance with the provisions of
Paragraph 8 of the Decree entered in this case. The schedule includes annual adjustments for sediment accumulation
in Ute Reservoir and assumes the other reservoirs subject
to the Article IV(b) limitation maintain storage at their total
capacity of 6,760 acre-feet. The schedule shall be adjusted
by the parties to reflect additional amounts of water in conservation storage in any reservoir enlarged or constructed

after 1992. Releases of water from Ute Reservoir will be
coordinated with Oklahoma and Texas and will be at the call
of Texas.

or Oklahoma for attorney's fees.
5. Oklahoma and Texas shall release New Mexico from
all claims for equitable or legal relief, other than the relief
embodied in the Decree of the parties, arising out of New

is entered.
6. In the event of a conflict between this Judgment and
the Decree entered in this case, the provisions of the Judgment shall control.

the parties.

OKLAHOMA v. NEW MEXICO
Decree

DECREE, AS MODIFIED
1. Under Article IV(a) of the Canadian River Compact
(Compact), New Mexico is permitted free and unrestricted
use of the waters of the Canadian River and its tributaries
in New Mexico above Conchas Dam, such use to be made
above or at Conchas Dam, including diversions for use on the
Tucumcari Project and the Bell Ranch and the on-project
storage of return, flow or operational waste from those two
projects so long as the recaptured water does not include
the mainstream or tributary flows of the Canadian River;
provided that transfers of water rights from above Conchas
Dam to locations below Conchas Dam shall be subject to the
conservation storage limitation of Compact Article IV(b).
Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to determine
whether or not the place of use of water rights may be transferred to locations outside the Canadian River basin in
New Mexico.
2. Under Compact Article IV(b), New Mexico is limited to
storage of no more than 200,000 acre-feet of the waters of
the Canadian River and its tributaries, regardless of point of
origin, at any time in reservoirs in the Canadian River basin
in New Mexico below Conchas Dam for any beneficial use,
exclusive of water stored for the exempt purposes specified
in Compact Article II(d) and on-project storage of irrigation
return flows or operational waste on the Tucumcari Project
and Bell Ranch as provided for in Paragraph 1 of this Decree.
3. Quantities of water stored primarily for flood protection, power generation, or sediment control are not chargeable as conservation storage under the Compact even though
incidental use is made of such waters for recreation, fish and
wildlife, or other beneficial uses not expressly mentioned in
the Compact. In situations where storage may be for multiple purposes, including both conservation storage and
exempt storage, nothing in this Decree shall preclude the
Canadian River Commission (Commission) from exempting

Cite as: 510 U. S. 126 (1993)
Decree

an appropriate portion of such storage from chargeability
as conservation storage.
4. Water stored at elevations below a dam's lowest permanent outlet works is not chargeable as conservation storage
under the Compact unless the primary use of that storage is
for a nonexempt purpose, or unless other means, such as
pumps, are utilized to discharge such storage volumes from
the reservoir. No change in the location of a dam's lowest
permanent outlet works to a higher elevation shall provide
the basis for a claim of exempt status for all water stored
below the relocated outlet works without prior approval of
the Commission, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Water stored for nonexempt purposes behind a dam with
capacity in excess of 100 acre-feet and with no outlet works
is chargeable as conservation storage.
5. Future designation or redesignation of storage volumes
for flood control, power production, or sediment control purposes must receive prior Commission approval to be exempt
from chargeability as conservation storage, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
6. All water stored in Ute Reservoir above elevation 3,725
feet is conservation storage; provided that at such time as
the authorization and funding of the Eastern New Mexico
Water Supply Project or other project results in changed
circumstances at Ute Reservoir, New Mexico may seek exemption of a reasonable portion of such water from the Commission under Paragraph 5 of this Decree and, if an exemption is denied, may petition the Court for appropriate relief
under Paragraph 11 of this Decree.
7. In 1988 there were 63 small reservoirs in New Mexico
with capacities of 100 acre-feet or less with a total capacity
of about 1,000 acre-feet, which the Commission has treated
as de minimis by waiving storage volume reporting obligations. Water stored in these reservoirs or in similarly sized
reservoirs in the future is not chargeable as conservation
storage, unless otherwise determined by the Commission.

OKLAHOMA v. NEW MEXICO
Decree

8.. Based on the elevation-capacity relationship of Ute Reservoir effective January 1, 1993, and adjustments pursuant
to Paragraph 9 of this Decree, New Mexico shall make and
maintain -appropriate releases of water from Ute Reservoir
or other conservation storage facilities in excess of 100 acrefeet of capacity at the maximum rate consistent with safe
operation of such reservoirs so that total conservation storage in the Canadian River basin below Conchas Dam in New
Mexico is limited to no more than 200,000 acre-feet at any
time; provided that operation of Ute Reservoir for the period
1993-2002 shall be pursuant to the schedule contained in the
Judgment entered in this case; and provided that no violation
of this paragraph will occur during any period in which the
outlet works of Ute Reservoir are discharging water at the
maximum safe discharge capacity (currently 350 cubic feet
per second) following the first knowledge that the 1993-2002
schedule or the Article IV(b) limitation after 2002 probably
would be exceeded; and provided further that Texas shall be
notified by New Mexico prior to a release and may allow
New Mexico to retain water in conservation storage in excess of the 1993-2002 schedule or the Article IV(b) limitation
after 2002, subject to the call of Texas and subject to the
provisions of Article V of the Compact. The outlet works
of Ute Reservoir shall be maintained in good working order
and shall not be modified to reduce the safe discharge capacity without prior approval of the Commission, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.
9. Sediment surveys of Ute Reservoir shall be conducted
at least every 10 years by New Mexico, unless such requirement is waived by the Commission. Conservation storage
in Ute Reservoir shall be determined from the most recent
sediment survey and an annual estimate of the total additional sediment deposition in the reservoir using an annual
average of sediment accumulation during the period between
1963 and the most recently completed survey.

10. Nothing in this Decree is intended to affect a State's
rights or :obligations under the Compact, except as specifically. addressed herein.
11. The Court retains jurisdiction of this suit for the purposes of any order, direction, or modification of this Decree,
,or any supplementary decree, that may at any time be
deemed proper in relation to the subject matter in contro,versy; provided, that any party requesting the Court to exercise its jurisdiction under this paragraph or answering such
request shall certify that it has attempted to negotiate in
good faith with the other parties in an effort to resolve the
dispute sought to be brought before the Court.
