DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF OREGON
v. ACF INDUSTRIES, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-74. Argued November 8, 1993-Decided January 24, 1994
The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, in relevant part, forbids States to impose (1) higher property tax rates and
assessment ratios upon "rail transportation property" than upon "other
commercial and industrial property," 49 U. S. C. §§ 11503(b)(1)-(3), and
(2) "another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation," § 11503(b)(4). Oregon exempts from its ad valorem property tax various classes of business personal property, but not railroad
cars owned by respondent companies. They filed suit in the District
Court, alleging that the tax violates § 11503(b)(4) because it exempts
certain classes of commercial property from taxation while taxing railroad cars in full. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
agreed that discriminatory property tax exemptions may be challenged
under subsection (b)(4). However, the Court of Appeals reversed the
lower court's finding that Oregon's tax complied with the provision,
holding instead that respondents were entitled to the same exemption
enjoyed by preferred property owners.
Held- Section 11503 does not limit the States' discretion to exempt nonrailroad property, but not railroad property, from generally applicable
ad valorem property taxes. Pp. 338-348.
(a) Respondents' position that "another tax that discriminates against
a rail carrier" is a residual category designed to reach any discriminatory state tax, including property taxes, not covered by subsections
(b)(1)-(3) is plausible only if subsection (b)(4) is read in isolation. However, the structure of § 11503 as a whole supports the view that subsection (b)(4) does not speak to property tax exemptions. "[C]ommercial
and industrial property," which serves as the comparison class for measuring property tax discrimination under subsections (b)(1)-(3), is defined in subsection (a)(4) as "property, other than transportation property and land used primarily for agricultural purposes or timber
growing, devoted to commercial or industrial use and subject to a property tax levy." The interplay between subsections (b)(1)-(3) and this
definition is central to subsection (b)(4)'s interpretation. For example,
Congress' exclusion of agricultural land from the definition demonstrates its intent to permit the States to tax railroad property at a
higher rate than agricultural land, notwithstanding subsection (b)(3)'s

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)
Syllabus
general prohibition of rate discrimination. To consider such a tax "another tax" under subsection (b)(4) would subvert the statutory plan by
reading subsection (b)(4) to prohibit what subsection (b)(3), in conjunction with subsection (a)(4), was designed to allow. The result would
contravene the elementary canon of construction that a statute should
be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative. Pp. 338-341.
(b) The phrase "subject to a property tax levy" further qualifies the
subsection (a)(4) definition. When used elsewhere in § 11503, that
phrase means property that is taxed; and since identical words used in
different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning,
the phrase must carry the same meaning in subsection (a)(4), Sorenson
v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860. Thus, exempt property is
not part of the comparison class. It would be illogical to conclude that
Congress, having allowed States to grant property tax exemptions in
subsections (b)(1)-(3), would turn around and nullify its own choice in
subsection (b)(4). Pp. 341-343.
(c) Other considerations reinforce the foregoing construction of the
statute. Section 11503's silence on the subject of tax exemptions-in
light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and assessment ratio discrimination-reflects a determination to permit the States to leave their exemptions in place. Principles of federalism compel this view, for a statute is interpreted to pre-empt traditional state powers only if that result
is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress. The statute's legislative
history casts no doubt upon this interpretation. Nor does the interpretation lead to an anomalous result. Since railroads are not the only
commercial entities subject to Oregon's tax, it need not be decided
whether subsection (b)(4) would prohibit a tax that did single out railroad property. And since it is within Congress' sound discretion to
weigh the benefit of preserving some exemptions against the benefit of
protecting rail carriers from every tax scheme that favors some nonrailroad property, the result reached here is not so bizarre that Congress
could not have intended it. See Demarestv. Manspeaker,498 U. S. 184,
191. Pp. 343-348.

carriers has been the source of recurrent litigation under the
Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. See, e. g.,
Central R. Co. of Pa. v. Pennsylvania,370 U. S. 607 (1962);
Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Nebraska Bd. of Equalizationand
Assessment, 347 U. S. 590 (1954); Morgan v. Parham, 16
Wall. 471 (1873). In the case before us, a state property tax
is challenged under a federal statute, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act). Pub.
L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31.
The question presented is whether the State of Oregon
violated the statute by imposing an ad valorem tax upon railroad property while exempting various other, but not all,
classes of commercial and industrial property. We hold that
a State may grant exemptions from a generally applicable
ad valorem property tax without subjecting the taxation of
railroad property to challenge under the relevant provision
of the 4-R Act, §306(1)(d), 49 U. S. C. § 11503(b)(4).
I
Oregon imposes an ad valorem tax upon all real and personal property within its jurisdiction, except property
granted an express exemption. Ore. Rev. Stat. § 307.030
(1991). Various classes of business personal property are
exempt, including agricultural machinery and equipment;
nonfarm business inventories; livestock; poultry; bees; furbearing animals; and agricultural products in the possession
of farmers. §§ 307.325, 307.400. Standing timber is also exempt, but is subject to a severance tax when harvested.
§321.272. Oregon, like many other States, exempts motor
Yehicles as well, instead levying upon them'a modest annual
registration fee. §§ 803.585, 803.420(1).
Respondents, called the "Carlines" in .this litigation, are
eight companies that lease railroad cars to railroads and shippers. The railroad cars are considered "tangible personal
property" under Oregon law, §307.030, and are not exempt
from taxation. The Carlines brought suit in United States
District Court under § 306(1)(d) of the 4-R Act, seeking de-

Opinion of the Court

claratory and injunctive relief against the assessment, levy,
and collection of the State's property tax upon their railroad cars.
Congress enacted the 4-R Act in part to "restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States."
§ 101(a), 90 Stat. 33. When drafting the legislation, Congress was aware that the railroads "'are easy prey for State
and local tax assessors' in that they are 'nonvoting, often
nonresident, targets for local taxation,' who cannot easily remove themselves from the locality." Western Air Lines,
Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D., 480 U. S. 123, 131
(1987) (quoting S. Rep. No. 91-630, p. 3 (1969)). Section 306
of the 4-R Act, now codified at 49 U. S. C. § 11503, addresses
this concern by prohibiting the States (and their subdivisions) from enacting certain taxation schemes that discriminate against railroads. See Burlington Northern R. Co. v.
Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 481 U. S. 454, 457 (1987).
The relevant provisions of § 11503 are contained in subsection (b), which states:
"The following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce, and a State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a State or subdivision of a State may not do any of them:
"(1) assess rail transportation property at a value
that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the
rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true
market value of the other commercial and industrial
property.
"(2) levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may
not be made under clause (1) of this subsection.
"(3) levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail
transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the
tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

"(4) impose another tax that discriminates against a
rail carrier providing transportation .... "
The reach of subsections (b)(1)-(3) is straightforward:
These provisions forbid the imposition of higher assessment
ratios or tax rates upon rail transportation property than
upon "other commercial and industrial property." The
scope of subsection (b)(4), which forbids the imposition of
"another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation," is not as clear.
The Carlines do not challenge Oregon's ad valorem property tax under subsections (b)(1)-(3). We attribute this
choice to the fact that the State subjects all nonexempt property "to assessment and taxation in equal and ratable proportion." Ore. Rev. Stat. §307.030 (1991). Rather, it is the
Carlines' contention that Oregon's tax should be considered
"another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier," in violation of subsection (b)(4), because it exempts certain classes
of commercial and industrial property while taxing railroad
cars in full.
The District Court, after reviewing a stipulated record,
held that discriminatory property tax exemptions are subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4). On the facts presented, however, the court determined that Oregon's ad valorem property tax complied with the provision. The court
observed that, in other cases, only those state taxes exempting more than 50% of nonrailroad commercial personal property had been found to contravene subsection (b)(4). See
Trailer Train Co. v. Leuenberger, 885 F. 2d 415 (CA8 1988),
cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1066 (1989); Burlington Northern R.
Co. v. Bair, 766 F. 2d 1222 (CAS 1985). Because (according
to the court's calculations) Oregon exempted only 31.4% of
nonrailroad commercial personal property from taxation, the
court granted judgment to the State.
The Court of Appeals reversed. 961 F. 2d 813 (CA9 1992).
In accordance with Circuit precedent, see ACF Industries,
Inc. v. Arizona, 714 F. 2d 93, 94 (CA9 1983), the court ac-

INDUSTRIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

knowledged that subsections (b)(1)-(3) do not speak to the
question of discriminatory property tax exemptions. Like
the District Court, however, the Court of Appeals accepted
the Carlines' contention that property tax exemptions are
subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4). The court explained that Congress enacted § 11503 to "'prevent tax discrimination against railroads in any form whatsoever."'
961 F. 2d, at 820 (emphasis in original) (citing Ogilvie v. State
Bd. of Equalizationof N. D., 657 F. 2d 204, 210 (CA8), cert.
denied, 454 U. S. 1086 (1981)).
Rejecting the District Court's apparent view that ad valorem tax schemes exempting less than 50% of nonrailroad
business property are not proscribed by subsection (b)(4),
the Court of Appeals held that the "most natural reading"
of the provision dictates that "any exemption given to other
taxpayers but not to railroads" is forbidden, with possible
room for "a de minimis level of exemption[s]." 961 F. 2d, at
822 (emphasis in original). The court found that Oregon's
property tax, under the calculation most generous to the
State, exempted 25% of nonrailroad commercial property, far
exceeding any possible de minimis exception. On this
ground, the court concluded that the State's taxation of railroad property violated subsection (b)(4). Id., at 823. Holding that the Carlines "were entitled to the same total exemption preferred property owners enjoyed," the court enjoined
the State from levying any tax upon the Carlines' railroad
property. Ibid.
We granted certiorari, 508 U.S. 905 (1993), and now
reverse.
II
Before passing upon the validity of Oregon's ad valorem
property tax under § 11503(b)(4), the Court of Appeals and

the District Court addressed a preliminary question:
Whether a tax upon railroad property is even subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4) on the ground that certain

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

other classes of commercial and industrial property are
exempt. We consider the same question.
Both parties contend that the plain meaning of subsection
(b)(4), which prohibits "another tax that discriminates
against a rail carrier," dictates an answer in their favor. In
the State's view, the word "another" means "different from
that which precedes it." Because subsections (b)(1)-(3) address property taxes and only property taxes, it follows that
the term "another tax" in subsection (b)(4) must mean "a tax
different from a property tax." The State concludes that
subsection (b)(4) does not speak to discriminatory property
tax exemptions for the simple reason that the provision does
not speak to property taxes at all.
The Carlines, like the Court of Appeals, take a different
view. They understand the phrase "another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier" to be a residual category
designed to reach any discriminatory state tax, including
discriminatory property taxes, not covered by subsections
(b)(1)-(3). It follows that property tax exemptions disfavoring railroad transportation property-exemptions the Carlines in effect admit fall outside the scope of subsections
(b)(1)-(3), see Brief for Respondents 16-17-are within the
ambit of subsection (b)(4). Accord, e. g., Trailer Train Co. v.
Leuenberger, 885 F. 2d 415, 417-418 (CA8 1988), cert. denied,
490 U. S. 1066 (1989); Department of Revenue of Fla. v.
Trailer Train Co., 830 F. 2d 1567, 1573 (CAll 1987). If Congress had intended to exclude property taxes from the reach
of subsection (b)(4), the Carlines contend, it would have
drafted the provision to prohibit "any tax other than a property tax," and not phrased the statute as it did. Brief for
Respondents 17.
Both the State's and the Carlines' readings are defensible
if subsection (b)(4) is read in isolation, cf. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 481 U. S., at 461 (language of subsection (b)(1) "plainly declares [its] purpose"),
and so we must look elsewhere to determine its meaning.

340

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF ORE. v. ACF
INDUSTRIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

The structure of § 11503 as a whole does yield an answer, one
adverse to the Carlines' challenge to Oregon's property tax.
We conclude that a State may grant exemptions from a generally applicable ad valorem property tax without exposing
the taxation of railroad property to invalidation under subsection (b)(4).
Subsections (b)(1)-(3) of §11503, as noted, forbid the imposition of higher property tax rates and assessment ratios
upon "rail transportation property" than upon "other commercial and industrial property." 49 U. S. C. H 11503(b)(1)(3). "Commercial and industrial property," which serves as
the comparison class for measuring unlawful discrimination
under those provisions, is defined as "property, other than
transportation property and land used primarily for agricultural purposes or timber growing, devoted to a commercial or industrial use and subject to a property tax levy."
§ 11503(a)(4).
The interplay between subsections (b)(1)-(3) and the definition of "commercial and industrial property" in subsection
(a)(4) is central to the interpretation of subsection (b)(4).
For example, the definition of "commercial and industrial
property" excludes "land used primarily for agricultural purposes." The fact that Congress made this particular exclusion demonstrates its intent to permit the States to tax railroad property at a higher rate than agricultural land,
notwithstanding subsection (b)(3)'s general prohibition of
rate discrimination. One still could maintain, we suppose,
that taxing railroad property at a higher rate than agricultural land should be considered "another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier," and thus forbidden under subsection (b)(4). That interpretation, however, would subvert
the statutory plan by reading subsection (b)(4) to prohibit
what subsection (b)(3), in conjunction with subsection (a)(4),
was designed to allow. The result would contravene the
"elementary canon of construction that a statute should
be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative."

Opinion of the Court

Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Pueblo of
Santa Ana, 472 U. S. 237, 249 (1985) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Congress qualified the definition of "commercial and industrial property" further, limiting the comparison class to
property "subject to a property tax levy." 49 U. S. C.
§ 11503(a)(4). The statute does not define this phrase, which
on its face could bear one of two interpretations: (1) taxed
property; or (2) taxable property, a broader category consisting of the general mass of property within the State's jurisdiction and power to tax, including property that enjoys a
current exemption.
The first interpretation has been the subject of some criticism, see Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization
of S. D., 480 U. S., at 135 (White, J., concurring),* but we
*Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D raised the
question whether certain property tax exemptions were prohibited under
the antidiscrimination provisions of the Airport and Airway Improvement
Act of 1982 (AAIA), 49 U. S. C. App. §§ 1513(d)(1)(A)-(C), which are identical for all relevant purposes to analogous provisions under the 47 R Act,
49 U. S. C. §§ 11503(b)(1)-(3). The case was on appeal from the Supreme
Court of South Dakota, which had held that such exemptions were not
subject to challenge under the AAIA. Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Hughes
County, 372 N. W. 2d 106 (1985). The court rested this ruling upon its
conclusion that the definition of "commercial and industrial property" in
the AAIA, 49 U. S. C. App. § 1513(d)(2)(D)-which, like the parallel definition in 49 U. S. C. § 11503(a)(4), is limited to property "subject to a property tax levy"-included taxed property but not exempt property, 372
N. W. 2d, at 110. Because the comparison class against which tax discrimination was measured under §§ 1513(d)(1)(A)-(C) did not include exempt
property, the court reasoned that the AAIA did not prohibit property
tax exemptions. We affirmed, but on grounds unrelated to the court's
construction of the terms "commercial and industrial property" and "subject to a property tax levy." Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D, 480 U. S., at 129-134. Justice White concurred, but expressed his view that the "ground on which the South Dakota Supreme
Court sustained the tax" was "plainly improvident." Id., at 135; see also
Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. North Dakota, 358 N. W. 2d 515, 517 (N. D.
1984).

342

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF ORE. v. ACF
INDUSTRIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

believe it follows from the way Congress used identical language elsewhere in § 11503. Section 11503(c) confers jurisdiction upon United States district courts to enforce the
terms of § 11503(b) despite the bar otherwise imposed by the
Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1341. Subsection (c)(1)
grants district courts the power (under certain circumstances not pertinent here) to prohibit
''an assessment of the rail transportation property at a
value that has a higher ratio to the true market value
of the rail transportation property than the assessed
value of all other property subject to a property tax levy
in the assessment jurisdiction has to the true market
value of all other commercial and industrial property."
(Emphasis added.)
In the context of this provision, which concerns the differential assessment of taxed property, the words "property subject to a property tax levy" must mean "taxed property."
Given the "normal rule of statutory construction" that
""'"identical words used in different parts of the same act
are intended to have the same meaning,"'" Sorenson v.
Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (quoting
Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84, 87
(1934) (in turn quoting Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v.
United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932))), that phrase must
carry the same meaning in subsection (a)(4), where it qualifies the definition of "commercial and industrial property."
All this bears on the case before us. Because property
''subject to a property tax levy" means property that is
taxed, the definition of "commercial and industrial property"
excludes property that is exempt. Exempt property, then,
is not part of the comparison class against which discrimination is measured under subsections (b)(1)-(3), and it follows
that railroads may not challenge property tax exemptions
under those provisions.

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

As was the case with agricultural land, we must pay heed
to the fact that Congress placed exempt property beyond
the reach of subsections (b)(1)-(3). It would be illogical to
conclude that Congress, having allowed the States to grant
property tax exemptions in subsections (b)(1)-(3), would
turn around and nullify its own choice in subsection (b)(4).
So the Carlines' reading of subsection (b)(4), while plausible
when viewed in isolation (see supra, at 339), is untenable in
light of § 11503 as a whole. See Gade v. National Solid
Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 99 (1992); see also
United Say. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood ForestAssociates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) ("A provision that may
seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory. scheme ...because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law"). It is true that tax
exemptions, as an abstract matter, could be a variant of tax
discrimination. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,
489 U.S. 803 (1989). The structure of § 11503, however,
warrants the conclusion that subsection (b)(4) does not limit
state discretion to levy a tax upon railroad property while
exempting various classes of nonrailroad property.
Other considerations reinforce our construction of the statute. In drafting § 11503, Congress prohibited discriminatory tax rates and assessment ratios in no uncertain terms,
see 49 U. S. C. §§ 11503(b)(1)-(3), and set forth precise standards for judicial scrutiny of challenged rate and assessment
practices, see §§ 11503(c)(1)-(2). By contrast, the statute
does not speak with any degree of particularity to the question of tax exemptions. Subsection (b)(4), which prohibits
the States from "impos[ing] another tax that discriminates
against a rail carrier," is, at best, vague on the point. Congress did not state whether exemptions are a form of forbidden discrimination against rail carriers, and further did not
provide a standard for courts to distinguish valid from invalid exemption schemes.

344

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF ORE. v. ACF
INDUSTRIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Had Congress, as a condition of permitting the taxation of
railroad property, intended to restrict state power to exempt
nonrailroad property, we are confident that it would have
spoken with clarity and precision. Property tax exemptions
are an important aspect of state and local tax policy. It was
common at the time § 11503 was drafted, as it is now, for
States with generally applicable ad valorem property taxes
to exempt various classes of commercial property. Before
1960, a number of States granted such exemptions. See,
e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. § 150.040 (1949) (exempting unmanufactured articles consigned for sale and held by commission
merchants); N. J. Rev. Stat. §54:4-3.20 (1937) (exempting
personal property stored in a public warehouse); Vt. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 32, § 3802 (1959) (exempting tools and implements
possessed by mechanics and farmers, and highway-building
equipment); see also Jacobs, Exemption of Tangible Personalty, in Tax Exemptions 141, 146 (1939) (by 1938, 16 States
permitted "temporary exemption of newly located or newly
constructed plants, and the machinery and equipment in such
plants"). By the 1960's, about 20 States granted real and
personal property tax exemptions to pollution control facilities. See McNulty, State Tax Incentives to Fight Pollution,
56 A. B. A. J. 747, 748, and n. 8 (Aug. 1970). By 1971, still
well before enactment of the 4-R Act, a majority of the
States exempted one or more classes of business personal
property, including business inventories, raw materials used
in textile manufacturing, manufacturing machinery and allied equipment, and mechanics tools. See Education Commission of the States, Property Assessment and Exemptions:
They Need Reform, Table C-1 (Mar. 10, 1973). Given the
prevalence of property tax exemptions when Congress
enacted the 4-R Act, § 11503's silence on the subject-in
light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and assessment
ratio discrimination-reflects a determination to permit the
States to leave their exemptions in place.

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

Principles of federalism support, in fact compel, our view.
Subsection (b)(4), like the whole of § 11503, sets limits upon
the taxation authority of state government, an authority we
have recognized as central to state sovereignty. See, e. g.,
Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S. 68, 73 (1976); Railroad Co. v.
Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 29 (1873). When determining the
breadth of a federal statute that impinges upon or pre-empts
the States' traditional powers, we are hesitant to extend the
statute beyond its evident scope. See Cipollone v. Liggett
Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 533 (1992) ("We do not, absent
unambiguous evidence, infer a scope of pre-emption beyond
that which clearly is mandated by Congress' language")

J., concurring); id., at 523 (opinion of STEVENS,

J.); R. J Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Durham County, 479 U. S.
130, 140 (1986). We will interpret a statute to pre-empt the
traditional state powers only if that result is "the clear and
manifest purpose of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). As explained above, neither
subsection (b)(4) nor the whole of § 11503 meets this standard
with regard to the prohibition of property tax exemptions.
The Carlines contend that the legislative history of § 11503
casts doubt upon our interpretation, but the history-to the
extent it has any relevance to our inquiry-affords the Carlines no comfort. The excerpts from the legislative record
cited by the Carlines do nothing more than manifest Congress' general concern with the discriminatory taxation of
rail carriers. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 94-595, p. 166 (1976) (describing the Senate bill, which the Conference adopted, as
prohibiting "the imposition of any other tax which results
in the discriminatory treatment of any common or contract
carrier"). The Carlines do not point to a single instance in
the legislative record suggesting that Congress had any particular concern with property tax exemptions, or that Congress intended to prohibit exemptions in subsection (b)(4).
In fact, the available evidence suggests the opposite of what
the Carlines would have us believe. See 120 Cong. Rec.

Opinion of the Court

38734 (1974) (providing assurances that subsection (b)(4)
would not prevent the States from granting tax exemptions
to encourage industrial development) (remarks of Reps.
Staggers, Adams, and Kuykendall).
Nor do the Carlines draw our attention to a single instance
in the 15-year legislative history of the 4-R Act in which
representatives of the railroad industry expressed concern
about discriminatory property tax exemptions. In fact,
when urging the Senate to adopt subsection (b)(4), industry
representatives characterized the provision as prohibiting
only discriminatory in lieu taxes and gross receipts taxes;
property tax exemptions, in contrast, were not mentioned.
See Hearings before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation of the Senate Committee on Commerce on Legislation
Relating to Rail Passenger Service, 94th Cong., 1st Sess.,
pt. 5, pp. 1837, 1883 (1975). In sum, the Carlines' argument
with respect to legislative history is without foundation.
As a final matter, we address the contention that our interpretation of subsection (b)(4) leads to an anomalous result.
The Carlines maintain that it would be nonsensical for Congress to prohibit the States from imposing higher tax rates
or assessment ratios upon railroad property than upon other
taxed property, while at the same time permitting the States
to exempt some or all classes of nonrailroad property altogether. That result, it is argued, prohibits discrimination of
a mild form, but permits it in the extreme. We think our
interpretation is not at all implausible.
To begin with, this is not a case in which the railroadseither alone or as part of some isolated and targeted groupare the only commercial entities subject to an ad valorem
property tax. Cf. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Superior,
932 F. 2d 1185 (CA7 1991) (occupation tax on owners and
operators of "iron ore concentrates docks," in practical effect,
applied only to docks owned by one particular rail carrier).
If such a case were to arise, it might be incorrect to say that
the State "exempted" the nontaxed property. Rather, one

Cite as: 510 U. S. 332 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

could say that the State had singled out railroad property
for discriminatory treatment. See J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein, State and Local Taxation 973 (5th ed. 1988) (the term
"exemption" does not mean every exclusion from the reach
of a levy, but rather exclusions of "property, persons, transactions . . . which are logically within the tax base"). On
the record before us, Oregon's ad valorem property tax does
not single out railroad property in that manner, and we need
not decide whether subsection (b)(4) would prohibit a tax of
that nature.
In addition, though some may think it unwise to forbid
discrimination in tax rates and assessment ratios while
permitting exemptions of certain nonrailroad property, the
result is not "so bizarre that Congress 'could not have
intended"' it. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 191
(1991) (citing Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S.
564, 575 (1982)). About half of the States grant property
tax exemptions to encourage investment in air and water
pollution control devices. See 1 CCH State Tax Guide 691692 (1992). And it is standard practice for States to grant
exemptions to commercial entities for other beneficial purposes. See, e.g., La. Const., Art. VII, § 21(F) (10-year exemption for any "new manufacturing establishment or [any]
addition to an existing manufacturing establishment"); Ore.
Rev. Stat. §285.597 (1991) (exemption for business property
in an "enterprise zone"); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-3661 (1991)
(permitting any county, city, or town to exempt from its
property tax "solar energy equipment, facilities or devices"
and "recycling equipment, facilities, or devices"). It is
within Congress' sound discretion to weigh the benefit of
preserving those exemptions, on the one hand, against the
benefit of protecting rail carriers from every tax scheme that
favors some nonrailroad property, on the other.
We conclude that § 11503, which expresses Congress' resolution of the matter, does not limit the States' discretion to
exempt nonrailroad property, but not railroad property, from

Section 306(1)(d) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act), 90 Stat. 54, as amended,
49 U. S. C. § 11503(b)(4) (subsection (b)(4)), prohibits States
from imposing taxes that discriminate against railroads.1 In
my view, a state tax that fell upon railroad property, but
from which comparable nonrailroad property was exempt,
would clearly implicate that prohibition. The Court errs in
holding that such arrangements are not even subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4).
Because subsection (b)(4) by its terms bars any tax that
"discriminates" against rail carriers, it is not surprising that
the Courts of Appeals have held that the provision applies
to revenue measures that discriminate by imposing taxes on
railroad property and exempting similar property owned by
others.2 While those courts (and the District Court and

Court of Appeals in this case) have differed on precisely how
to decide whether a wholesale exemption unlawfully "discriminates" and thus gives rise to liability, none has taken
the position accepted by the Court today that a claim predicated on discriminatory exemptions is not cognizable under
subsection (b)(4).
As the Court explains, ante, at 343, subsection (b)(4) does
not contain a specific prohibition against imposing on railroads an ad valorem tax from which other property owners
are exempt. That omission, of course, does not answer the
question before us: whether the tax that Oregon has imposed
"discriminates against a rail carrier" within the meaning of
subsection (b)(4). A State might discriminate against a disfavored class of taxpayers in a variety of ways. The absence
in the 4-R Act of a provision specifically addressing exemptions is no more significant than the absence of a provision
addressing deductions, credits, methods of collecting or protesting state taxes, or penalties. Surely a state tax law that
allowed a substantial tax deduction for all taxpayers except
rail carriers would readily be recognized as discriminatory.
That conclusion would not be affected by the fact that the
antidiscrimination statute does not speak specifically to deductions. Indeed, the Court suggests that an exemption for
all taxpayers except rail carriers would make the tax discriminatory. See ante, at 346.
Rather than addressing every means that might be devised to accord discriminatory tax treatment to rail carriers,
Congress specified two familiar methods (differential rates
and assessments) and then included a general provision de454 U. S. 1086 (1981). Only the Virginia Supreme Court has reached the
contrary conclusion, see Richmond, F & P R. Co. v. State Corporation
Comm'n, 230 Va. 260, 262, 336 S. E. 2d 896, 897 (1985), and it did so on a
basis that I do not understand the Court to accept today-that because ad
valorem property taxes are treated in the first three subsections, an ad
valorem property tax may never be attacked as discriminatory under subsection (b)(4).

signed to block other routes to the same end. In my opinion, it is anomalous to read § 11503(b) to prohibit even minor
deviations in rates or assessments, but then to allow States
to put manifestly disproportionate tax burdens on railroads
by exempting most comparable property. Both the text of
subsection (b)(4) and its evident purposes convince me that
Congress intended to bar discrimination by any means, including exemptions.
In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803
(1989), this Court held that a State's exemption of a limited
class of residents violated a general statutory prohibition
against discriminatory taxation (4 U. S. C. § 111) that made
no specific reference to exemptions. While I disagreed with
the Court's conclusion that the limited exemption at issue
could fairly be characterized as discrimination against the
protected class, Davis surely demonstrates that an exemption, even if not expressly prohibited, may support the conclusion that a tax is discriminatory. Indeed, tax exemptions
may make a tax unconstitutionally discriminatory. See,
e. g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 273 (1984);
Armco Inc. v. Hardesty,467 U. S. 638, 642-646 (1984). I see
noreason why they should be totally ignored when Congress
has expressly prohibited "discrimination" against a particular kind of interstate enterprise.
The Court puts great stock in the difference between the
specific and strict bar against discriminatory tax rates and
assessments in subsections (b)(1)-(3) and the open-ended
language of subsection (b)(4), which speaks only tersely of
"discriminat[ion]." As the Court explains, the definition
of "commercial and industrial property" that is applicable to
subsections (b)(1)-(3) is best read to embrace only property
that is taxed, rather than exempted. If we were to accept
the Carlines' position, the Court reasons, subsection (b)(4)
would render the earlier provisions redundant and would
"nullify" the limitations Congress placed on the rate and
assessment provisions. Ante, at 343. I disagree.

STEVENS, J., dissenting

The ban on discriminatory rates and assessments targets
two patent and historically common forms of discrimination.
In order to find discrimination in rates or assessment ratios,
a court need only compare the rates and assessments applicable to railroads to the rates and assessments of other owners
of comparable property. That inquiry would be complicated indeed if the courts were required to divine the
"rates" and "assessments" governing property that is exempt from tax. It is not surprising, then, that the strict
bars against disparate rates and assessments exclude from
the comparison class property that is not taxed at all.
Congress' exclusion of exempted property from the comparison class for purposes of subsections (b)(1)-(3) does not
determine the scope of subsection (b)(4), for that provision does not depend on the limited definition of "commercial
and industrial property" that governs its neighbors.' Reading subsection (b)(4) to require judicial scrutiny of state exemption schemes creates no disharmony with subsections
(b)(1)-(3) unless one assumes that the test of "discrimination" under subsection (b)(4), like the per se rules against
differential rates and assessments, prohibits all but the most
minor differentials in tax treatment between railroad property and owners of similar property. That assumption is
unwarranted.
The statute before the Court today (like the statute it construed in Davis) does not contain a definition of the term
"discrimination," but that familiar concept and the policies
of the 4-R Act provide guidance. Like the statute at issue
in Davis, the 4-R Act protects taxpayers who often have
little voice in the policy decisions of the taxing State, and
whose situation makes them likely targets for unfavorable
treatment.8 The prohibition of discrimination should be

high rates of fixed investment and their immobile assets

352

read to give effect to those concerns, but it need not be read
more broadly. A sensible test for prohibited discrimination-focusing on whether the protected class is being
treated substantially less favorably than most similarly situated persons-would leave the States room to employ exemptions without falling afoul of subsection (b)(4).
As amicus the Solicitor General suggests, a discrimination
standard allows the States to impose disparate tax burdens
when the disparity is supported by some legitimate difference between the exempted nonrailroad property and the
taxed railroad property.4 In my view, an exemption for a
small minority of the resident taxpayers would not warrant
a conclusion that prohibited "discrimination" has occurred.
See Davis, 489 U. S., at 819-823 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
Because subsection (b)(4) merely protects railroads from discrimination, rather than conferring on them a right to be
treated like the most favorably treated taxpayer, a violation
would not be established when the tax paid on railroad property is not materially greater than the tax imposed on most
comparable property.5 But surely a tax imposed on rail carriers is not saved from discrimination merely because some
other kind of enterprise (e. g., motor carriers) is also subject
to taxation.
The evident purpose of this part of the 4-R Act, as the
Court recognizes, is to protect a class of interstate enterprises that has traditionally been subject to disproportionately heavy state and local tax burdens. This is an area in
which state authority has always been circumscribed, most
4A State might, for example, be able to defend an exemption by showing
that the exempted class was subject to an equivalent tax to which railroads were not.
For similar reasons, the Court of Appeals erred when it held that the
remedy for a discriminatory exemption scheme is a refund of the entire

tax paid by the railroad.

See 961 F. 2d, at 823.

To remedy unlawful

discrimination under subsection (b)(4), a State need refund only the difference between the tax collected from the railroad and the average tax im-

posed on owners of comparable property.

prominently by the Commerce Clause itself. Subsection
(b)(4) plainly requires States to readjust their tax arrangements to the extent those arrangements "discriminat[e]." I
cannot agree that federalism "compels" us to read subsection
(b)(4) as inapplicable to exemption arrangements. See ante,
at 345.
Federalism concerns would weigh more heavily in favor of
Oregon's position if, as the Court suggests, ante, at 344-345,
reading subsection (b)(4) to apply to exemption schemes
would require States to choose between exempting railroads
or eliminating tax exemptions across the board. But as I
have explained, such a reading is by no means required. Because the statutory term "discrimination" permits the States
greater flexibility to employ exemptions than do the bans on
disparate rates and assessments, the Court's concerns about
imposing onerous choices on States are overstated.6 Moreover, an exemption that is meaningfully available to railroads-as in the Court's example of an exemption for funds
spent on environmental cleanup-would not make a tax "discriminatory" merely because the exemption may be more
useful for some other businesses than it is for railroads.
Cf. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Superior, 932 F. 2d 1185,
1187 (CA7 1991) (invalidating tax "imposed on an activity in
which only a railroad or railroads engage").
The Court appears to hedge against its position that subsection (b)(4) flatly does not apply to taxes and exemption
schemes that operate to burden railroads disproportionately.
Thus, the Court intimates that the state ad valorem tax
6The cases in which exemption schemes have been found unlawful under
subsection (b)(4) certainly do not suggest any undue incursions into state
fiscal policy. See, e. g., Trailer Train Co. v. Leuenberger, 885 F. 2d 415,
416 (CA8 1988) (violation found because State imposed ad valorem tax on
railroad personal property but exempted over 75 percent of comparable
property), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1066 (1989); Burlington Northern R. Co.
v. Bair, 766 F. 2d 1222, 1223-1224 (CA8 1985) (tax on railroad personal
property coupled with exemption for 95 percent of other personal property
violated statute).

must, in order to escape scrutiny under subsection (b)(4), be
"generally applicable," ante, at 335, 340, and that a scheme
that taxed railroad property but exempted all nonrailroad
property might be unlawful because it would not be a bona
fide "exemption." See ante, at 346-347. If I were convinced that Oregon's ad valorem property taxes were generally applicable, I would agree with the Court's disposition of
this case. The narrowness or breadth of the exemptions,
and correspondingly the evenhanded or discriminatory nature of the tax on railroads, goes to whether a subsection
(b)(4) claim has merit, not to whether it is cognizable. The
statute provides no basis for prohibiting the exemption of
100 percent of nonrailroad property but allowing the exemption of, for example, 90 percent.
I recognize that application of the statutory "discrimination" standard will sometimes involve problems of line drawing, and that discriminatory exemptions raise special difficulties. But, in my view; the statute requires courts to
grapple with those difficulties. I would remand the case to
the Court of Appeals to give it an opportunity to resolve the
parties' disputes about the extent of any disparate burdens
imposed on rail carriers by Oregon's ad valorem tax and to
review the discrimination issue in accordance with the considerations set forth in this opinion.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
