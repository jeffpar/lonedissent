ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR
RELATIONS BOARD
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-1550.

Argued December 1, 1993-Decided January 24, 1994

After Michael Manso gave his employer, petitioner ABF Freight System,
Inc. (ABF), a false excuse for being late to work, ABF ascertained that
he was lying and fired him on the asserted ground of tardiness. He
filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations
Board (Board) and repeated his false tardiness excuse while testifying
under oath before an Administrative Law Judge (AL), who denied him
relief upon concluding that he had lied and that ABF had discharged
him for cause. The Board reversed in relevant part, finding that ABF
did not in fact fire Manso for lying but had seized upon his tardiness as
a pretext to discharge him for earlier union activities. Notwithstanding his dishonesty, the Board ordered ABF to reinstate him with backpay. The Court of Appeals enforced the order, rejecting ABF's argument that awarding reinstatement and backpay to an employee who lied
to his employer and to the ALJ violated public policy.
Held: Manso's false testimony under oath before the ALM did not preclude
the Board from granting him reinstatement with backpay. Although
such misconduct is intolerable in a formal proceeding, 29 U. S. C. ยง 160(c)
expressly delegates to the Board the primary responsibility for making
remedial decisions, including awarding reinstatement with backpay, that
best effectuate the policies of the National Labor Relations Act (Act)
when the Board has substantiated an unfair labor practice. Confronted
with that kind of express delegation, courts must give an agency's decision controlling weight unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the Act. It cannot be said that the Board's remedial order
in this case was an abuse of its broad discretion or that it was obligated
to adopt a rigid rule that would foreclose relief in all comparable cases.
Nor can its conclusions be faulted that Manso's reason for being late to
work was ultimately irrelevant to whether antiunion animus actually
motivated his discharge and that ordering effective relief in a case of
this character promotes a vital public interest. It would be unfair to
sanction Manso while indirectly rewarding the lack of candor of several
ABF witnesses, whose testimony the AJ and the Board refused to
credit. Moreover, a categorical rule against relief might force the

Opinion of the Court

certiorari to consider whether Manso's misconduct should
have precluded the Board from granting him that relief.
I
Manso worked as a casual dockworker at petitioner ABF
Freight System, Inc.'s (ABF's) trucking terminal in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from the summer of 1987 to August
1989. He was fired three times. The first time, Manso was
1 of 12 employees discharged in June 1988 in a dispute over
a contractual provision relating to so-called "preferential
casual" dockworkers.' The grievance Manso's union filed
eventually secured his reinstatement; Manso also filed an
unfair labor practice charge against ABF over the incident.
Manso's return to work was short lived. Three supervisors warned him of likely retaliation from top managementalerting him, for example, that ABF was "gunning" for
him, App. 96, and that "the higher echelon was after [him],"
id., at 96-97. See also ABF Freight System, Inc., 304
N. L. R. B. 585, 592, 597 (1991). Within six weeks ABF discharged Manso for a second time on pretextual groundsostensibly for failing to respond to a call to work made under
a stringent verification procedure ABF had recently imposed
upon preferential casuals. 2 Once again, a grievance panel
ordered Manso reinstated.
IABF at this time had three dockworker classifications: those on the
regular seniority list, nonpreferential casuals, and preferential casuals.
ABF Freight System, Inc., 304 N. L. R. B. 585, 589, n. 10 (1991). A supplemental labor agreement ABF negotiated with the union in April 1988
created the preferential casual dockworker classification with certain seniority rights. Id., at 585-586.
2 The policy required preferential casuals-though not other dockworkers-to be available by phone prior to a shift in case a foreman needed
them to work. A worker who did not respond risked disciplinary action for failing to "protect his shift"; two such failures authorized ABF
to discharge the worker. Id., at 597. ABF issued a written warning to
Manso on May 6, 1989, after he failed to respond to such a call. On June
19, a supervisor again asked a regular dockworker to summon Manso to
work just prior to 6 a.m. for the 8:30 a.m. shift. When Manso did not

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB
Opinion of the Court

Manso's third discharge came less than two months later.
On August 11, 1989, Manso arrived four minutes late for the
5 a.m. shift. At the time, ABF had no policy regarding lateness. After Manso was late to work, however, ABF decided
to discharge preferential casuals-though not other employees-who were late twice without good cause. Six days
later Manso triggered the policy's first application when he
arrived at work nearly an hour late for the same shift.
Manso telephoned at 5:25 a.m. to explain that he was having
car trouble on the highway, and repeated that excuse when
he arrived. ABF conducted a prompt investigation, ascertained that he was lying,3 and fired him for tardiness under
its new policy on lateness.
Manso filed a second unfair labor practice charge. In the
hearing before the ALJ, Manso repeated his story about the
car trouble that preceded his third discharge. The AL
credited most of his testimony about events surrounding his
dismissals, but expressly concluded that Manso lied when he
told ABF that car trouble made him late to work. Id., at
600. Accordingly, although the AL decided that ABF had
illegally discharged Manso the second time because he was a
answer, the employee who had dialed his number asked to dial it again,
fearing he had misdialed. The supervisor denied permission and instead
had the employee sign a form verifying that Manso had not responded.
Manso was then discharged. The AUJ found that the special call policy
discriminated against preferential casual dockworkers as a class, id., at
598, 600; both the ALJ and the Board concluded that it was discriminatorily applied to Manso, id., at 600, 589, n. 11.
8
Manso told ABF management that his car had overheated on the highway, that he had to phone his wife to pick him up and take him to work.
Manso also said a deputy sheriff stopped him for speeding in his ensuing
rush. A plant manager who looked for Manso's overheated car on the
highway found nothing, however, and the officer who Manso said issued
him a warning for speeding told ABF officials-and later the AL-that
Manso had been alone in the car.

Opinion of the Court

party to the earlier union grievance, 4 the ALT denied Manso
relief for the third discharge based on his finding that ABF
had dismissed Manso for cause. Ibid.
The Board affirmed the AL's finding that Manso's second
discharge was unlawful, but reversed with respect to the
third discharge. Id., at 591. Acknowledging that Manso
lied to his employer and that ABF presumably could have
discharged him for that dishonesty, id., at 590, n. 13, the
Board nevertheless emphasized that ABF did not in fact discharge him for lying and that the ALJ's conclusion to the
contrary was "a plainly erroneous factual statement of
[ABF]'s asserted reasons." 5 Instead, Manso's lie "established only that he did not have a legitimate excuse for the
August 17 lateness." Id., at 589. The Board focused primarily on ABF's retroactive application of its lateness policy
to include Manso's first time late to work, holding that ABF
had "seized upon" Manso's tardiness "as a pretext to discharge him again and for the same unlawful reasons it discharged him on June 19."6 In addition, though the Board
deemed Manso's discharge unlawful even assuming the validity of ABF's general disciplinary treatment of preferential
casuals, it observed that ABF's disciplinary approach and
lack of uniform rules for all dockworkers "raise[d] more
questions than they resolve[d]." Id., at 590. The Board
ordered ABF to reinstate Manso with backpay. Id., at 591.
4Specifically, the AIJ held that the dismissal violated ยงยง8(a)(1), (3), and
(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29
U. S. C. ยงยง 158(a)(1), (3), and (4).
5 304 N. L. R. B., at 590.
The Board found that the record in this case
unequivocally established that ABF did not treat Manso's dishonesty "in
and of itself as an independent basis for discharge or any other disciplinary
action."
Ibid.
6
Id., at 591. The Board also noted that the supervisors' threats of retaliation and the earlier unlawful discharge under the verification policy
provided "strong evidence" of unlawful motivation regarding Manso's third
discharge. Id., at 590.

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB
Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order. Miera
v. NLRB, 982 F. 2d 441 (CAIO1992). Its review of the rec
ord revealed "abundant evidence' of antiunion animus in
ABF's conduct towards Manso," id., at 446, including "ample
evidence" that Manso's third dischiarge was not for cause,
ibid. The court regarded as important the testimony in the
record confirming that Manso would not have been discharged under ABF's new tardiness policy had he provided
a legitimate excuse. Ibid. The court also rejected ABF's
argument that awarding reinstatement and backpay to an
employee who lied to his employer and to the ALJ violated
public policy.7 Noting that "Manso's original misrepresentation was made to his employer in ah attempt to avoid being
fired under a policy the application of which the Board found
to be the result of antiunion animus," the court reasoned that
the Board had wide discretion to ascertain what remedy best
furthered the policies of the National Labor Relations Act
(Act). Id., at 447.
II
The question we granted certiorari to review is a narrow
one.8 We assume that the Board correctly found that ABF
discharged Manso unlawfully in August 1989. We also assume, more importantly, that the Board did not abuse its
discretion in ordering reinstatement even though Manso
7

ABF's public policy argument relies on several decisions refusing to
enforce reinstatement orders where the employee had engaged in serious
misconduct. See, e. g., PrecisionWindow Mfg. v. NLRB, 963 F. 2d 1105,
1110 (CA8 1992) (employee lied about extent of union activities and threatened to kill supervisor); NLRB v. Magnusen, 523 F. 2d 643, 646 (CA9
1975) (employee padded time card and lied about it under oath); NLRB v.
Commonwealth Foods, Inc., 506 F. 2d 1065, 1068 (CA4 1974) (employees
engaged in theft from employer); NLRB v. Breitling, 378 F. 2d 663, 664
(CA10 1967) (employee confessed to stealing from employer).

We limited our grant of certiorari to the third question in the petition:
"Does an employee forfeit the remedy of reinstatement with backpay after
the Administrative Law Judge finds that he purposefully testified falsely
during the administrative hearing?" Pet. for Cert. i.

Opinion of the Court

gave ABF a false reason for being late to work. We are
con'cerned only with the ramifications of Manso's false testimony under oath in a formal proceeding before Ithe AL.
We recognize that the Board might have decided that such
misconduct disqualified Manso from profiting from the proceeding, or it might even have adopted a fiat rule precluding
reinstatement when a former employee so testifies. As the
case comes to us, however, the issue is not whether the
Board might adopt such a rule, but whether it must do so.
False testimony in a formal proceeding is intolerable. We
must neither reward nor condone such a "flagrant affront" to
the truth-seeking function of adversary proceedings. See
United States v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1976).
See also United States v. Knox, 396 U. S. 77 (1969); Bryson
v. United States, 396 U. S. 64 (1969); Dennis v. United States,
384 U. S. 855 (1966); Kay v. United States, 303 U. S. 1 (1938);
United States v. Kapp, 302 U. S. 214 (1937); Glickstein v.
United States, 222 U. S. 139, 141-142 (1911). If knowingly
exploited by a criminal prosecutor, such wrongdoing is so
"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of justice" that
it can vitiate a judgment even after it has become final.
Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935). In any proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, deliberate falsehoods "well may affect the dearest concerns of the parties
before a tribunal," United States v. Norris, 300 U. S. 564,
574 (1937), and may put the factfinder and parties "to the
disadvantage, hindrance, and delay of ultimately extracting
the truth by cross examination, by extraneous investigation
or other collateral means." Ibid. Perjury should be severely sanctioned in appropriate cases.
ABF submits that the false testimony of a former employee who was the victim of an unfair labor practice should
always preclude him from winning reinstatement with backpay. That contention, though not inconsistent with our appraisal of his misconduct, raises countervailing concerns.
Most important is Congress' decision to delegate to the

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB
Opinion of the Court

Board the primary responsibility for making remedial decisions that best effectuate the policies of the Act when it has
substantiated an unfair labor practice. The Act expressly
authorizes the Board "to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as
will effectuate the policies of [the Act]." 29 U. S. C. ยง 160(c).
Only in cases of discharge for cause does the statute restrict
the Board's authority to order reinstatement.9 This is not
such a case.
When Congress expressly delegates to an administrative
agency the authority to make specific policy determinations,
courts must give the agency's decision controlling weight unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the
statute." Chevron U S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984). Because this
case involves that kind of express delegation, the Board's
views merit the greatest deference. This has been our consistent appraisal of the Board's remedial authority throughout its long history of administering the Act. 10 As we explained over a half century ago:
"Because the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a
matter for administrative competence, courts must not
enter the allowable area of the Board's discretion and
must guard against the danger of sliding unconsciously
from the narrow confines of law into the more spacious
domain of policy." Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313
U. S. 177, 194 (1941).
9,,No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment
to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for
cause." 29 U. S. C. ยง 160(c).
10
See Virginia Elec. & Power Co. v. NLRB, 319 U.S. 533, 539-540
(1943). We stated in Virginia Electric that such administrative determinations should stand "unless it can be shown that the order is a patent
attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act." Id., at 540.

Notwithstanding our concern about the seriousness of
Manso's ill-advised decision to repeat under oath his false
excuse for tardiness, we cannot say that the Board's remedial
order in this case was an abuse of its broad discretion or that
it was obligated to adopt a rigid rule that would foreclose
relief in all comparable cases. Nor can we fault the Board's
conclusions that Manso's reason for being late to work was
ultimately irrelevant to whether antiunion animus actually
motivated his discharge and that ordering effective relief in
a case of this character promotes a vital public interest.
Notably, the ALJ refused to credit the testimony of several ABF witnesses, see, e.g., 304 N. L. R. B., at 598, and the
Board affirmed those credibility findings, id., at 585. The
unfairness of sanctioning Manso while indirectly rewarding
those witnesses' lack of candor is obvious. Moreover, the
rule ABF advocates might force the Board to divert its attention from its primary mission and devote unnecessary
time and energy to resolving collateral disputes about credibility. Its decision to rely on "other civil and criminal remedies" for false testimony, cf. St. Mary's Honor Center v.
Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 521 (1993), rather than a categorical
exception to the familiar remedy of reinstatement is well
within its broad discretion.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court and agree as well with the
concerns expressed by JUSTICE SCALIA. Our law must not
become so caught up in procedural niceties that it fails to
sort out simple instances of right from wrong and give some
redress for the latter. At the very least, when we proceed
on the assumption that perjury was committed, the Government ought not to suggest, as it seemed to do here, that one
who violates his testimonial oath is no worse than the stuJUSTICE KENNEDY,

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB

dent who claims the dog ate his homework. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 42.
The Board's opinions show that it can become quite exercised about trial-related misconduct that obstructs its own
processes. See Lear-Siegler Management Service Corp.,
306 N. L. R. B. 393, 394 (1992) (tolling the backpay award of
an employee who threatened a witness, because such manipulation undermined "[t]he integrity of the Board's judicial
process"). The Board seems more blithe, however, about
the potential for dishonesty to disrupt the workplace. See
Owens Illinois, Inc., 290 N. L. R. B. 1193 (1988) (reinstating
and awarding backpay to an employee who lied under oath,
because the employer "failed to meet its burden of establishing that [the employee] is unfit for further employment").
True, the gravest consequence of lying under oath is the affront to the law itself. But both employer and employee
have reason to insist upon honesty in the resolution of disputes within the workplace itself. And this interest, too, is
not beyond the Board's discretion to take into account in
fashioning appropriate relief.
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,
concurring in the judgment.
It is ordinarily no proper concern of the judge how the
Executive chooses to exercise discretion, so long as it be
within the scope of what the law allows. For that reason,
judicial dicta criticizing unintelligent (but nonetheless lawful) executive action are almost always inappropriate. The
context changes, however, when the exercise of discretion
relates to the integrity of the unitary adjudicative process
that begins in an administrative hearing before a federal
administrative law judge and ends in a judgment of this or
some other federal court. Agency action or inaction that
undermines and dishonors that process undermines and
dishonors the legal system-undermines and dishonors the

courts. Judges may properly protest, no matter how lawful

Cite as: 510 U. S. 317 (1994)
SCALIA, J.,

concurring in judgment

(and hence unreversible) the agency action or inaction may
be. Such a protest is called for in the present case, in which
the Board has displayed-from its initial decision through its
defense of that decision in this Court-an unseemly toleration of perjury in the course of adjudicative proceedings.
Michael Manso, the employee to whom the Board awarded
backpay and reinstatement, testified in this case before Administrative Law Judge Walter H. Maloney the week of January 8, 1990. He was placed under oath-presumably standing up, his right hand raised, to respond to the form of oath
set forth in the NLRB Judges' Manual ยง 17008 (1984):
"Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you
will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
He then proceeded to lie to the administrative tribunal, as
he had earlier lied to his employer, concerning the reason he
reported an hour late for work on August 17, 1989. He said
that his car had broken down; that he called his wife, who
came in her pajamas to pick him up; that he drove the rest
of the way to work, with his wife, and was stopped for speeding along the way. The employer produced the officer that
stopped him, who testified with assurance that Manso was
all alone; that Manso mentioned no car trouble as an excuse

for his speeding, but simply that he was late for work; and
that the officer himself observed no car trouble. Hearsay
evidence admitted (without objection) at the hearing showed
that an ABF official, after Manso told his breakdown story
on August 17, drove out to the portion of the highway where
Manso said he had left the disabled vehicle, and found it not
to be there. Administrative Law Judge Maloney found that
"Manso was lying to the Respondent when he reported that
his car had overheated and that he was late for work because
of car trouble"-which meant, of course that he was also
lying under oath when he repeated that story. ABF Freight
System, Inc., 304 N. L. R. B. 585, 600 (1991). The ALJ did

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB
SCALIA, J.,

concurring in judgment

not punish the false testimony, but his finding that the dismissal on August 17 was for cause had something of that
effect, depriving Manso of reinstatement.
The Board itself accepted the ALJ's finding that the carbreakdown story was a lie, but since it found that the real
reason for the August 17 dismissal was neither Manso's lateness nor his dishonesty, but rather retaliation for his filing of
an earlier unfair-labor-practice complaint, it ordered Manso's
reinstatement. In stark contrast to today's opinion for the
Court, the Board's opinion did not carefully weigh the pros
and cons of using the Board's discretion in the conferral of
relief to protect the integrity of its proceedings. It weighed
those pros and cons not at all. Indeed, it mentioned the
apparent perjury not at all, as though that is just part of
the accepted background of Board proceedings, in no way
worthy of note. That insouciance persisted even through
the filing of the Board's brief in this Court, which makes
the astounding statement that, in light of his "history of
mistreatment," Manso's lying under oath, "though unjustifiable, is understandable." Brief for Respondent 22, n. 15.
(In that context, of course, the plain meaning of "to understand" is "[t]o know and be tolerant or sympathetic toward."
American Heritage Dictionary 1948 (3d ed. 1992).)
Well, I am not understanding of lying under oath, whatever the motivation for it, and I do not believe that any law
enforcement agency of the United States ought to be. Title
18 U. S. C. ยง 1621 provides:
"Whoever"... having taken an oath before a competent tribunal,
officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the
United States authorizes an oath to be administered,
that he will testify... truly,... willfully and contrary
to such oath states ... any material matter which he

"is guilty of perjury and shall.., be fined not more than
$2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or
both.... "

United States Attorneys doubtless cannot prosecute perjury
indictments for all the lies told in the Nation's federal proceedings-not even, perhaps, for all the lies so cleanly nailed
as was the one here. Not only, however, did the Board not
refer the matter for prosecution, it did not impose, indeed
did not even explicitly consider imposing, another sanction
available to it (and not generally available to federal judges):
denying discretionary relief because of the intentional subversion of the Board's processes.
While the Court is correct that we have no power to compel the Board to apply such a sanction, nor even, perhaps, to
require that the Board's opinion explicitly consider it, neither
was the Board's action in this case as eminently reasonable
as the Court makes it out to be. Nor does it deserve the
characterization of being "well within [the Board's] broad
discretion," ante, at 325 (emphasis added). In my estimation, it is at the very precipice of the tolerable, particularly
as concerns the Board's failure even to consider and discuss
the desirability of limiting its discretionary relief.
Denying reinstatement would not, as the Court contends,
involve the "unfairness of sanctioning Manso while indirectly
rewarding [ABF] witnesses' lack of candor." Ibid. First of
all, no "indirect reward" comes to ABF, which receives nothing from the Board. There is a world of difference between
the mere inaction of failing to punish ABF for lying (which
is the "indirect reward" that the Court fears) and the beneficence of conferring a nonmandated award upon Manso
despite his lying (which is the much greater evil that the
Court embraces). The principle that a perjurer should not
be rewarded with a judgment-even a judgment otherwise
deserved-where there is discretion to deny it, has a long
and sensible tradition in the common law. The "unclean

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC. v. NLRB

hands" doctrine "closes the door of a court of equity to one
tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have
been the behavior of the defendant." PrecisionInstrument
Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324
U. S. 806, 814 (1945) (denying relief because of perjury). See
H. McClintock, Principles of Equity ยง26, p. 63, and n. 75 (2d
ed. 1948). And the Board itself has sometimes applied this
sanction in the past. See, e. g., D. V Copying & Printing,
Inc., 240 N. L. R. B. 1276 (1979); O'Donnell's Sea Grill, 55
N. L. R. B. 828 (1944). In any case, there is no realistic
comparison between the ABF managers' disbelieved testimony concerning motivations for firing and Manso's crystalclear lie that he was where he was not. The latter is the
stuff of perjury prosecutions; the former is not.
The Court is correct that an absolute rule requiring the
denial of discretionary relief for perjury "might force the
Board to divert its attention from its primary mission and
devote unnecessary time and energy to resolving collateral
disputes about credibility." Ante, at 325. But intelligent
and conscientious application of the Board's supposed rule
permitting denial of discretionary relief for perjury would
not have that effect-and such application should probably
have occurred, and should surely have been considered, in an
obvious case such as this. Nor am I as impressed as the
Court is by the Board's assertion that "ordering effective
relief in a case of this character promotes a vital public interest." Ibid. Assuredly it does, but plenty of effective relief
was ordered here without adding Manso's reinstatement, including (1) the entry of a cease-and-desist order subjecting
ABF to severe sanctions if it commits similar unfair labor
practices in the future, (2) the award of backpay to Manso
for the period from his unlawful discharge on June 19, 1989,
to the date of his subsequent reinstatement, and (3) the posting of a notice on ABF's premises, reciting its commitments
under the cease-and-desist order, and its commitment to give

Manso backpay. All of this would have made it clear enough
to ABF and to ABF's employees that violating the National
Labor Relations Act does not pay. Had the posted notice
also included, instead of ABF's commitment to reinstate
Manso (which is what the Board ordered), a statement to the
effect that Manso's reinstatement would have been ordered
but for his false testimony, then it also would have been
made clear to ABF and to ABF's employees that perjury
does not pay.
I would have felt no need to write separately if I thought
that, as the Court puts it, the Board has simply decided "to
rely on 'other civil and criminal remedies' for false testimony." Ibid. My impression, however, from the Board's
opinion and from its presentation to this Court, is that it
is really not very much concerned about false testimony. I
concur in the judgment of the Court that the NLRB did
nothing against the law, and regret that it missed an opportunity to do something for the law.
