IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE
ET AL. v. LEGALIZATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY
FEDERATION OF LABOR ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-426. Decided November 26, 1993
The application for a stay of a District Court order-which requires applicant Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to, among other
things, identify and adjudicate legalization applications filed by certain
categories of applicants, not arrest or deport certain immigrant classes,
and temporarily grant certain immigrant classes stays of deportation
and employment authorization-is granted. If presented with the
question, this Court would grant certiorari and conclude that respondents, organizations providing legal help to immigrants, have no standing
to seek the order granted by the District Court because they are outside
the zone of interests that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986 (IRCA) seeks to protect. See Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883. IRCA was clearly meant to protect the interests of undocumented aliens, not organizations such as respondents.
Although respondents were entities designated to assist legalization
efforts during IRCA's amnesty period, the fact that an INS regulation
may have affected the way they allocated their resources does not give
them standing. The balance of equities also tips in the INS' favor.
The order would impose a considerable administrative burden on the
INS and would delay the deportation of at least those aliens who are
deportable and who could not seek relief on their own behalf under Reno
v. Catholic Social Services, 509 U. S. 43. If respondents lack standing,
the order would also be an improper intrusion by a federal court into
the workings of a coordinate branch of Government. On the other
hand, those aliens whose deportation claims are ripe may still sue in
their own right, as may organizations whose members' claims are ripe,
assuming those organizations meet organizational standing criteria.

1302 INS v. LEGALIZATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT OF LOS
ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR
Opinion in Chambers

Circuit Justice.
The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), requests that I stay an order
of the District Court for the Western District of Washington
pending appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The Court of Appeals has rejected the INS' application for
such a stay. Though "stay application[s] to a Circuit Justice
on a matter before a court of appeals [are] rarely granted,"
Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U. S. 1328, 1330 (1983) (REHNQUIST, J.,
in chambers) (internal quotation marks omitted), I believe
this is an exceptional case in which such a stay is proper.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR,

I
In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), 100 Stat. 3359, which provided
a limited amnesty for immigrants who had come to or stayed
in the country illegally. See 8 U. S. C. § 1255a. Not all such
immigrants were, however, eligible. Among other restrictions, the amnesty was available only to those who had "resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status
since [January 1, 1982]," § 1255a(a)(2)(A); also, those who
came to the country legally but stayed illegally could only
get amnesty if their "period of authorized stay

. . .

expired

before [January 1, 1982,]" or their "unlawful status was
known to the Government as of [January 1, 1982],"
§1255a(a)(2)(B). Respondents, organizations that provide
legal help to immigrants, believe the INS interpreted these
provisions too narrowly, in violation of the statute and the
United States Constitution, and in 1988 brought their challenge to court.
In March 1989, the District Court ruled in respondents'
favor, and in September 1992, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in
part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court
for further proceedings. On June 1, 1993, the District Court
issued an order requiring the INS to, among other things,
identify and adjudicate legalization applications filed by

Cite as: 510 U. S. 1301 (1993)
Opinion in Chambers

certain categories of applicants, not arrest or deport certain classes of immigrants, and temporarily grant certain
classes of immigrants stays of deportation and employment
authorizations.
On June 18, 1993, this Court decided Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43 (1993) (CSS), a case involving a very similar challenge to another portion of IRCA. In
CSS, we held that the claims of most of the plaintiff aliens
were barred by the ripeness doctrine. A federal court, we
held, generally ought not entertain a request for an injunction or declaratory judgment regarding the validity of an
administrative regulation unless it is brought by someone
who has actually been concretely affected by the regulation.
Id., at 57-58. The mere existence of the regulation, we held,
was not enough; rather, the regulation must actually have
been applied to the plaintiff. Ibid. We concluded that the
only people who could ask for injunctive or declaratory relief
under IRCA were those who were told by the INS that they
should not even bother to file their applications-a policy
called "front-desking"---and perhaps also those who could
show that the front-desking policy was a substantial cause
of their failure to apply in the first place. Id., at 61-67, and
n. 28. Under the statute, aliens who did apply and whose
applications were considered but rejected could only .get
judicial review of this rejection if the INS tried to deport
them. 8 U. S. C. § 1255a(f)(1).
In light of our decision in CSS, the Government asked the
District Court to vacate its order, on the theory that respondents' claims here, like the claims of the CSS plaintiffs,
were not ripe. The District Court, however, disagreed.
The CSS plaintiffs, the District Court pointed out, were individual aliens, whereas the plaintiffs in this case are organizations. The District Court concluded that the organizations
had "suffered a concrete and demonstrable injury" because
"the challenged regulations drained organizational resources
and impaired their ability to assist and counsel nonimmi-

grants"; therefore, the court held, the organizations' claims
were ripe. App. B to Application 6, citing LegalizationAssistance Projectof Los Angeles County Federationof Labor
v. INS, 976 F. 2d 1198, 1204 (CA9 1992), cert. pending, No.
93-73. Therefore, "because this case has assumed the posture of a broad-based challenge to the regulations in question
by organizations which the Ninth Circuit explicitly found
have standing to bring these claims," App. B to Application
6, the court declined to vacate its June 1 order.
II
As a Circuit Justice dealing with an application like this,
I must try to predict whether four Justices would vote to
grant certiorari should the Court of Appeals affirm the
District Court order without modification; try to predict
whether the Court would then set the order aside; and balance the so-called "stay equities." Heckler v. Lopez, supra,
at 1330-1331. This is always a difficult and speculative inquiry, but in this case it leads me to conclude that a stay
is warranted.
Respondents assert that the INS is violating the law of
the land, and they ask the federal courts to order the INS to
stop this. But the broad power to "take Care that the Laws
be faithfully executed" is conspicuously not granted to us by
the Constitution. Rather, it is given to the President of the
United States, see U. S. Const., Art. II, § 3, along with the
power to supervise the conduct of the Executive Branch,
Art. II, §§ 1, 2, which includes the INS. The federal courts
are granted a different sort of power-the power to adjudge
"Cases" or "Controversies," Art. III, §2, cl. 1, within the
jurisdiction defined by Congress, Art. III, §2, cl. 2.
Congress has in fact considered the proper scope of federal
court jurisdiction to review administrative agency actions.
It has explicitly limited such review to claims brought by
"person[s] suffering legal wrong[s] because of agency action"
(not applicable to the respondent organizations involved

Cite as: 510 U. S. 1301 (1993)

Opinion in Chambers

here) or by persons "adversely affected or aggrieved by
agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute." 5
U. S. C. §702 (emphasis added). We have consistently interpreted this latter clause to permit review only in cases
brought by a person whose putative injuries are "within the
'zone of interests' sought to be protected by the statutory
provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint." Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S.
871, 883 (1990) (NWF); see also Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U. S. 388, 396-397 (1987).
I believe that, were it presented with this question, this
Court would grant certiorari and conclude that the respondents are outside the zone of interests IRCA seeks to protect,
and that therefore they had no standing to seek the order
entered by the District Court. The District Court's decision
and the Court of Appeals decision on which it relies, 976 F.
2d, at 1208, conflict with Ayuda, Inc. v. Reno, 7 F. 3d 246
(CADC 1993), and relate to an important question of federal
law. See this Court's Rule 10. Moreover, on the merits,
IRCA was clearly meant to protect the interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations such as respondents. Though such organizations did play a role in the
IRCA scheme-during the amnesty period, they were socalled "qualified designated entities," which were to "assis[t]
in the program of legalization provided under this section,"
§ 1255a(c)(2)-there is no indication that IRCA was in any
way addressed to their interests. The fact that the INS
regulation may affect the way an organization allocates its
resources-or, for that matter, the way an employer who currently employs illegal aliens or a landlord who currently
rents to illegal aliens allocates its resources-does not give
standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests
the statute meant to protect. NWF, supra, at 883.
The balance of equities also tips in the INS' favor. The
order would impose a considerable administrative burden on
the INS, and would delay the deportation of-and require

1306 INS v. LEGALIZATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT OF LOS
ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR
Opinion in Chambers

the granting of interim work authorizations to-at least
those aliens who are deportable and who could not seek relief
on their own behalf under CSS. Moreover, if the above
analysis is correct, the order is not merely an erroneous
adjudication of a lawsuit between private litigants, but an
improper intrusion by a federal court into the workings
of a coordinate branch of the Government. See Heckler v.
Lopez, 463 U. S., at 1336-1337; FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 141 (1940). On the other hand, neither
CSS nor this stay prevents those aliens who were ordered
deported or were front-desked, and are therefore possibly
eligible for relief under CSS, from suing in their own right.
Likewise, neither CSS nor this stay prevents any membership organizations which have members whose claims are
ripe under CSS from suing on behalf of those members,
assuming the organizations meet the criteria required for
organizational standing.
I therefore grant the application to stay the District
Court's order pending final disposition of the appeal by the
Court of Appeals.
