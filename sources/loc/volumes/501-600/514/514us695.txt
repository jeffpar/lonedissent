HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-172.

Argued February 21, 1995-Decided May 15, 1995

Petitioner's falsehoods in unsworn papers ified in Bankruptcy Court
prompted his indictment under 18 U. S. C. § 1001, which criminalizes
false statements and similar misconduct occurring "in any matter within
the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States." He
was convicted after the District Court, relying on United States v.
Bramblett, 348 U. S.503, instructed the jury that a bankruptcy court is
a "department of the United States" within § 1001's meaning. In affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that the so-called "judicial function" exception developed in other Circuits, under which § 1001 reaches
false statements made while a court is performing its "administrative"
or "housekeeping" functions, but not its adjudicative functions, does
not exist.
Held: The judgment is reversed in part.
16 F. 3d 694, reversed in part.
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that, because a federal court is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within § 1001's meaning, the statute does not apply to false statements made in judicial proceedings.
Pp. 699-708, 715.
(a) A straightforward interpretation of §1001's text, with special emphasis on the words "department or agency," leads inexorably to the
conclusion that there is no need for any judicial function exception because the statute's reach simply does not extend to courts. Under both
a commonsense reading and the terms of 18 U. S. C. §6-which applies
to all of Title 18 and defines "agency" to include, inter alia, any federal
"department, independent establishment, commission, administration,
authority, board or bureau"-it seems incontrovertible that "agency"
does not refer to a court. Moreover, although § 6 defines "department"
to mean an "executive departmen[t] ... unless the context shows that
such term was intended to describe the ... legislative ... or judicial
branches," there is nothing in § 1001's text, or in any related legislation,
that even suggests-let alone "shows"-that something other than a
component of the Executive Branch was intended in this instance.
Pp. 699-702.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
(b) The Bramblett Court erred by giving insufficient weight to the
plain language of §§ 6 and 1001 and, instead, broadly interpreting "department" in § 1001 to refer to the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial
Branches. Rather than attempting to reconcile its interpretation with
the usual meaning of "department," that Court relied on a review of the
evolution of §1001 and a related statute as providing a "context" for the
conclusion that "Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such
as [Bramblett's] without penalty." 348 U. S., at 509. Although a statute's historical evolution should not be discounted, such an analysis normally provides less guidance to meaning than the final text. Here, a
straightforward reading suggests a meaning of "department" that is
fully consistent with § 6's presumptive definition. Moreover, the statutory history chronicled in Bramblett is at best inconclusive and does
not supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrant departure from that
definition. Pp. 702-708.
(c) Bramblett is hereby overruled. P. 715.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG and 'JUSTICE
BREYER, concluded in Parts IV and V:
1. A review of pertinent lower court decisions demonstrates that the
judicial function exception is an obvious attempt to impose limits on
Bramblett's expansive reading of § 1001 and that the exception has a
substantial and longstanding following. Pp. 708-711.
2. The doctrine of stare decisi8 does not require this Court to accept
Bramblett'serroneous interpretation of § 1001. Reconsideration of that
case is permitted here (1) because of a highly unusual intervening development of the law-the judicial function exception-which is fairly characterized as a competing legal doctrine that can lay a legitimate claim
to respect as a settled body of law, and (2) because of the absence of
significant reliance interests in adhering to Bramblett on the part of
prosecutors and Congress. Pp. 711-715.
JUSTICE SCAuIA, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY, agreed that United
States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503, should be overruled, but concluded
that the doctrine of stare decisis may be ignored in this case not because
the judicial function exception represents an intervening development
of the law, but because of the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett's
mistaken reading of § 1001 poses a risk that the threat of criminal
prosecution under § 1001's capacious provisions will deter vigorous
representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control
the machinery of § 1001 prosecution. That problem can be judicially
avoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that
is irrational or by importing exceptions, such as the judicial function
exception, that have no basis in law. Pp. 716-717.

Opinion of the Court
STEVENS, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and VI, in which
SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined, and an
opinion with respect to Parts IV and V, in which GINSBURG and BREYER,

JJ., joined. SCALIA, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment, in which KENNEDY, J., joined, post, p. 716. REHNQUIST,
C. J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which O'CONNOR and SOUTER, JJ.,

joined, post, p. 718.

Paul Morris argued the cause for petitioner. With him
on the brief was Andrew Boros.
Richard P. Bress argued the cause for the United States.
With him on the brief were Solicitor General Days, Assistant Attorney General Harris, Deputy Solicitor General
Dreeben, and Joel M. Gershowitz.
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court,
except as to Parts IV and V.*
In unsworn papers filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, petitioner made three false statements of fact. Each of those
misrepresentations provided the basis for a criminal conviction and prison sentence under the federal false statement
statute, 18 U. S. C. § 1001. The question we address is
whether § 1001 applies to false statements made in judicial
proceedings.
I
In 1985, petitioner filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the
course of the proceedings, the trustee filed an amended complaint and a motion to compel petitioner to surrender certain
business records. Petitioner opposed the relief sought by
the trustee in a pair of unsworn, written responses filed with
the Bankruptcy Court. Both of his responses contained
falsehoods. Petitioner's answer to the trustee's complaint
falsely denied the trustee's allegations that a well-drilling
machine and parts for the machine were stored at petition*JUSTICE THOMAS joins Parts I, II, III, and VI of this opinion.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

er's home and in a nearby warehouse. Petitioner's response
to the trustee's discovery motion incorrectly stated that petitioner had already turned over all of the requested records.
When the misrepresentations came to light, petitioner was
charged with three counts of making false statements under
18 U. S. C. § 1001.1 That statute provides:
"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any
department or agency of the United States knowingly
and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,
scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,
fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing
the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent
statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000
or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
Relying on our decision in United States v. Bramblett, 348
U. S. 503 (1955), the District Court instructed the jury that
a bankruptcy court is a "department . . . of the United
States" within the meaning of §1001. The jury convicted petitioner on all three § 1001 counts, and the District
Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months'
imprisonment.
On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
petitioner argued that his convictions under § 1001 were
barred by the so-called "judicial function" exception. First
suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, 309
F. 2d 234 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this
doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct
occurring in the federal courts. Under the exception, only
those misrepresentations falling within a court's "administrative" or "housekeeping" functions can give rise to liability
'Petitioner was also charged with, and convicted of, bankruptcy fraud
and mail fraud under 18 U. S. C. §§ 152 and 1341 (1988 ed. and Supp. V).
The validity of those convictions is not before us.

Opinion of the Court

under §1001; false statements made while a court is performing its adjudicative functions are not covered.
The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's convictions
under § 1001. Although the judicial function exception has
become entrenched over the years in a number of Circuits,
the Sixth Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that the exception does not exist. 16 F. 3d 694 (1994). That conclusion
created a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.2 513 U. S. 959 (1994). We now reverse.
II
Section 1001 criminalizes false statements and similar misconduct occurring "in any matter within the jurisdiction of
any department or agency of the United States." In ordinary parlance, federal courts are not described as "departments" or "agencies" of the Government. As noted by the
Sixth Circuit, it would be strange indeed to refer to a court
as an "agency." See 16 F. 3d, at 698, n. 4 ("[T]he U. S. Court
of Appeals [is not] the Appellate Adjudication Agency").
And while we have occasionally spoken of the three branches
of our Government, including the Judiciary, as "department[s]," e. g., Mississippiv. Johnson,4 Wall. 475, 500 (1867),
that locution is not an ordinary one. Far more common is
the use of "department" to refer to a component of the Executive Branch.
2

The judicial function exception has been recognized in the following
cases: United States v. Masterpol, 940 F. 2d 760, 764-766 (CA2 1991);
United States v. Holmes, 840 F. 2d 246, 248 (CA4), cert. denied, 488 U. S.
831 (1988); United States v. Abrahams, 604 F. 2d 386, 393 (CA5 1979);
United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (CA9 1985) '(per curiam);
United States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 694-695 (CA10 1993). Although the
Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits have questioned the basis of
the exception, see United States v. Barber,881 F. 2d 345, 350 (CA7 1989),
cert. denied, 495 U. S. 922 (1990); United States v. Poindexter, 951 F. 2d
369, 387 (CADC 1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1021 (1992), the Sixth Circuit
stands alone in unambiguously rejecting it.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

As an initial matter, therefore, one might be tempted to
conclude that § 1001 does not apply to falsehoods made during federal-court proceedings. This commonsense reading
is bolstered by the statutory definitions of "department" and
"agency" set forth at 18 U. S. C. § 6. First adopted in 1948,
and applicable to all of Title 18, the definitions create a presumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of the terms at
issue:
"The term 'department' means one of the executive
departments enumerated in section 1 [now § 101] of
Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was
intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government.
"The term 'agency' includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary
interest, unless the context shows that such term was
intended to be used in a more limited sense."
Under §6, it seems incontrovertible that "agency" does not
refer to a court.2 "Department," on the other hand, might
be interpreted under § 6 to describe the Judicial Branch,
but only if the "context" of § 1001 "shows" that Congress
intended the word to be used in the unusual sense employed in Mississippi v. Johnson. We believe that § 6 permits such an interpretation only if the context in § 1001 is
fairly powerful. "Shows" is a strong word; among its definitions is "[t]o make apparent or clear by evidence, testimony
or reasoning; to prove; demonstrate." Webster's New International Dictionary 2324 (2d ed. 1949). Cf. Rowland v.
CaliforniaMen's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council,
506 U.¥S. 194, 200-201 (1993) (discussing similar provision
I We express no opinion as to whether any other entity within the Judicial Branch might be an "agency" within the meaning of § 6.

Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

requiring adherence to presumptive definition unless context
"indicate[d]" a different meaning).
In Rowland, we explained the proper method of analyzing
a statutory term's "context" to determine when a presumptive definition must yield. Such an analysis, we explained,
requires a court to examine "the text of the Act of Congress
surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other related
congressional Acts .... " Id., at 199; see also id., at 212-213
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Monell v. New York City Dept. of
Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 689-690, n. 53 (1978). Review
of other materials is not warranted. "If Congress had
meant to point further afield, as to legislative history, for
example, it would have been natural to use a more spacious
phrase, like 'evidence of congressional intent,' in place of
'context."' Rowland, 506 U. S., at 200.
In the case of § 1001, there is nothing in the text of the
statute, or in any related legislation, that even suggests-let
alone "shows"-that the normal definition of "department"
was not intended. Accordingly, a straightforward interpretation of the text of § 1001, with special emphasis on the
words "department or agency," would seem to lead inexorably to the conclusion that there is no need for any judicial
function exception because the reach of the statute simply
does not extend to courts. Our task, however, is complicated by the fact that the Court interpreted "department"
broadly 40 years ago in Bramblett. We must, therefore,
4 Congress'

use of the word "shows" is unsurprising in view of the fact

that 18 U. S. C. §6 provides statutory definitions exclusively for criminal
statutes. We have often emphasized the need for clarity in the definition
of criminal statutes, to provide "fair warning ...

in language that the

common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain
line is passed." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931). See
also United States v. Batchelder,442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979); Lanzetta v. New
Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Adhering to the statutory definition of
a particular term is fully consistent with this objective. Cf. Rowland, 506
U. S., at 199 (construing 1 U. S. C. § 1, which is generally applicable to any
Act of Congress).

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

turn our attention to that case before deciding the fate of the
judicial function exception.
III
Defendant Bramblett was a former Member of Congress
who had falsely represented to the Disbursing Office of the
House of Representatives that a particular person was entitled to compensation as his official clerk. He argued that he
could not be convicted under §1001 because his falsehood
was directed to an office within the Legislative Branch. 348
U. S., at 504. The Court rejected this argument, concluding
that the word "department," as used in § 1001, "was meant
to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of
the Government." Id., at 509. Although Bramblett involved Congress, not the courts, the text and reasoning in
the Court's opinion amalgamated all three branches of the
Government. Thus, Bamblett is highly relevant here even
though its narrow holding only extended § 1001 to false statements made within the Legislative Branch.
We think Bramblett must be acknowledged as a seriously
flawed decision. Significantly, the Bramblett Court made no
attempt to reconcile its interpretation with the usual meaning of "department." It relied instead on a review of the
evolution of § 1001 and its statutory cousin, the false claims
statute presently codified at 18 U. S. C. §287, as providing a
"context" for the conclusion that "Congress could not have
intended to leave frauds such as [Bramblett's] without penalty." 348 U. S., at 509. We are convinced that the Court
erred by giving insufficient weight to the plain language of
§8 6 and 1001. 5 Although the historical evolution of a stat6

Inaddition, it is debatable at best whether the Court was correct in
asserting that, but for its expansive interpretation of § 1001, Bramblett's
fraud would necessarily have gone unpunished. In discussing the evolution of §1001, the Court noted that the false claims statute, originally
enacted in 1863 and by 1955 codified at 18 U. S. C. §287, "clearly covers
the presentation of false claims against any component of the Government

Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

ute-based on decisions by the entire Congress-should not
be discounted for the reasons that may undermine confidence
in the significance of excerpts from congressional debates
and committee reports, 6 a historical analysis normally provides less guidance to a statute's meaning than its final text.
In the ordinary case, absent any "indication that doing so
would frustrate Congress's clear intention or yield patent absurdity, our obligation is to apply the statute as Congress
wrote it." BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation,511 U. S.
531, 570 (1994) (SOUTER, J., dissenting).
As noted above, a straightforward reading of the statute
suggests a meaning of "department" that is fully consistent
with the definition set forth in § 6. See supra, at 699-702.
Similarly unremarkable is the language of the original Act
of Congress adopting what is now § 1001. That piece of legislation-the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 996 (1934 Act)to any officer of the Government." United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S.
503, 505 (1955). In an earlier decision, it had interpreted "claim" in the
false claims statute broadly, explaining that the word referred to "a claim
for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government's own liability to the claimant."
United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S.339, 345-346 (1926). Bramblett could
thus seemingly have been charged with violating § 287, or at least aiding
and abetting in a violation of that statute, since his misrepresentation
was intended to procure Government compensation. See Supplemental
Memorandum for the United States in United States v. Bramblett, 0. T.
1954, No. 159 (arguing that Bramblett's conviction could be affirmed because his conduct violated all the elements of §287). In today's decision,
we do not disturb the scope of § 287 as construed in either Cohn or
Bramblett.
Bramblett's fraud also was arguably directed at an "agency" within the
meaning of § 1001. The Court recognized this contention, noting "it might
be argued, as the Government does, that the [Disbursing Office] is an
'authority' within the § 6 definition of 'agency."' 348 U. S., at 509. The
Court refused, however, to rest its decision on that more narrow interpretation.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

amended what was then §35 of the Criminal Code to provide,
in pertinent part:
"[W]hoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or
cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher,
roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition,
knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious
statement or entry, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States
or of any corporation in which the United States of
America is a stockholder... [shall be punished]." (Emphasis added.)
This language conveys no different message regarding "department" than the current version of § 1001.
What, then, of the earlier statutory history chronicled in
Bramblett? We believe it is at best inconclusive, and that
it does not supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrant
departure from the presumptive definition in 18 U. S. C. § 6.
The earliest statutory progenitor of § 1001 was the original
false claims statute, adopted as the Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67,
12 Stat. 696 (1863 Act). That enactment made it a criminal
offense for any person, whether a civilian or a member of the
military services, to
"present or cause to be presented for payment or approval to or by any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States, any claim upon or
against the Government of the United States, or any
department or officer thereof, knowing such claim to be
'7
false, fictitious, or fraudulent."
'In Bramblett, the Court incorrectly stated that the 1863 Act only penalized misconduct by members of the military. In fact, §3 of the Act
established criminal and civil penalties for false claims and other misdeeds

Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

The 1863 Act also proscribed false statements, but the scope
of that provision was far narrower than that of modern-day
§ 1001; the Act prohibited only those false statements made
"for the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of [a false] claim." 12 Stat. 696. The
Court explained in Bramblett that the false claims provision
in the 1863 Act "clearly cover[ed] the presentation of false
claims against any component of the Government to any officer of the Government," 348 U. S., at 505, and it asserted
similar breadth for the false statement portion of the Act,
ibid.
The false statements provision in the 1863 Act remained
essentially unchanged for 55 years.8 In 1918, Congress
amended the statute to provide as follows:
"[W]hoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to
obtain the payment or approval of [a false] claim, or for
the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United
States, or any department thereof, or any corporation
in which the United States of America is a stockholder,
shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or
cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a materialfact,
or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent
statements or representations,or make or use or cause
to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll,
account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious
statement or entry [shall be punished]." Act of Oct. 23,
committed by "any person not in the military or naval forces of the United
States." 12 Stat. 698.
1In 1873, the statute was codified and minor changes were made. See
Rev. Stat. §5438. The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30, 1908,
35 Stat. 555, and the statute was recodified as §35 of the Criminal Code
in the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1095.'

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015-1016 (1918 Act) (emphasis
added).
The scope of this new provision is unclear. Although it
could be read to create criminal liability for governmentwide false statements, its principal purpose seems to have
been to prohibit false statements made to defraud Government corporations, which flourished during World War I.
Cf. Lebron v. National RailroadPassengerCorporation,513
U. S. 374, 386-391 (1995) (tracing history of Government corporations). In one important respect, moreover, the statute
remained relatively narrow: It was limited to false statements intended to bilk the Government out of money or
property. See United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339 (1926).
Given the continuing focus on financial frauds against the
Government, the 1918 Act did not alter the fundamental
character of the original false claims statute.
The 1934 Act, which created the statute we now know as
§ 1001, did work such a change. Congress excised from the
statute the references to financial frauds, thereby severing
the historical link with the false claims portion of the statute,
and inserted the requirement that the false statement be
made "in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States." This addition, critical for present purposes, is subject to two competing inferences. On one hand, it can be read to impose new words of
limitation-whose ordinary meaning connotes the Executive
Branch-in an altogether reformulated statute. On the
other hand, it can be viewed as stripping away the financial
fraud requirement while not disturbing the pre-existing
breadth the statute had enjoyed from its association with the
false claims statute.
The Bramblett Court embraced the latter inference, finding no indication in any legislative history that the amendment was intended to narrow the scope of the statute. We
think this interpretation, though not completely implausible,
is nevertheless unsound. The differences between the 1934

Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

Act and its predecessors are too dramatic to evidence a congressional intent to carry forward any features of the old
provision. Moreover, our comments, over the years, regarding the 1934 legislation-including those contained in Bramblett itself-contradict the notion that such a "carry forward" occurred.
We have repeatedly recognized that the 1934 Act was
passed at the behest of "the Secretary of the Interior to aid
the enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforcement of regulations.., with respect to the transportation of
'hot oil."' United States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S. 86, 93-94
(1941); see also United States v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 72
(1984) (the 1934 Act was "needed to increase the protection
of federal agencies from the variety of deceptive practices
plaguing the New Deal administration"); id., at 80 (REHNQuIST, J., dissenting) (the statute was prompted by problems
arising from "the advent of the New Deal programs in the
1930's"). Indeed, the Bramblett Court itself acknowledged
the connection between the 1934 Act and the proliferation of
fraud in the newly formed Executive agencies:
"The 1934 revision was largely the product of the urging of the Secretary of the Interior. The Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 1202, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., indicates that
its purpose was to broaden the statute so as to reach not
only false papers presented in connection with a claim
against the Government, but also nonmonetary frauds
such as those involved in the 'hot-oil' shipments." 348
U. S., at 507.
None of our opinions refers to any indication that Congress
even considered whether the 1934 Act might apply outside
the Executive Branch, much less that it affirmatively understood the new enactment to create broad liability for falsehoods in the federal courts. In light of this vacuum, it would
be curious indeed if Congress truly intended the 1934 Act to

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

work a dramatic alteration in the law governing misconduct
in the court system or the Legislature. The unlikelihood
of such a scenario only strengthens our conclusion that the
Bramblett Court erred in its interpretation of § 1001's statutory history.
Putting Bramblett's historical misapprehensions to one
side, however, we believe the Bramblett Court committed a
far more basic error in its underlying approach to statutory
construction. Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plain
language of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. In
Bramblett, the Court's method of analysis resulted in a decision that is at war with the text of not one, but two different
Acts of Congress.
Whether the doctrine of stare decisis nevertheless requires that we accept Bramblett's erroneous interpretation
of § 1001 is a question best answered after reviewing the
body of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judicial function exception.
IV
Although other federal courts have refrained from directly
criticizing Bramblett's approach to statutory construction, it
is fair to say that they have greeted the decision with something less than a warm embrace. The judicial function exception, an obvious attempt to impose limits on Bramblett's
expansive reading of § 1001, is a prime example. As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception is
almost as deeply rooted as Bramblett itself.
The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years
after Bramblett was decided. In Morgan v. United States,
309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the
defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide
member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity,

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

and nonadmission to the bar. After first acknowledging
that, but for Bramblett, it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the
courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. But the
court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001.
Noting that the statute prohibits "concealment" and "covering up" of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods,
the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the
bounds of responsible advocacy.9 The court concluded its
opinion with this significant comment:
"We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme
Court intended the statute to include traditional trial
tactics within the statutory terms 'conceals or covers
up.' We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme
Court construction, that the statute does apply to the
type of action with which appellant was charged, action
which essentially involved the 'administrative' or 'housekeeping' functions, not the 'judicial' machinery of the
court." 309 F. 2d, at 237.
Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit reversed a conviction several years later "because
§ 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents
as evidence in a criminal proceeding." United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam). The court
explained that the judicial function exception suggested in
Morgan was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with
its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined. 381 F. 2d, at 175.
9"'Does a defendant "cover up ...a material fact" when he pleads not
guilty?'

'Does an attorney "cover up" when he moves to exclude hearsay

testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf
of a client he knows to be guilty?"' Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d
234, 237 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Once planted, the judicial function exception began to
flower in a number of other Circuits. The Ninth Circuit
summarized the state of the law in 1985:
"[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001
has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions
since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided
that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch. In these twenty-three
years, there has been no response on the part of
Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.
It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no
exception exists." United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d
1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).
The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying
in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth
Circuit had adverted in Mayer. The Second Circuit wrote:
"No court, to our knowledge, whether due to its acceptance of the exception or to prosecutorial reticence,
has ever sustained a section 1001 conviction for false
statements made by a defendant to a court acting in its
judicial capacity. The exception was first articulated
nearly thirty years ago and '... [i]t therefore seems too
late in the day to hold that no exception exists.' Mayer,
775 F. 2d at 1390." United States v. Masterpol, 940
F. 2d 760, 766.10
10 Some 17 years before Masterpol, the Second Circuit restricted the
application of § 1001 in a slightly different manner. In United States v.
D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction
arising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civil
lawsuit. Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history,
the court concluded that §1001 did not apply "where the Government is
involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved." Id., at 28. Accord, United States
v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CAll 1983).

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Although not all of the courts of appeals have endorsed
the judicial function exception, it is nevertheless clear that
the doctrine has a substantial following. See n. 2, supra.
Moreover, as both the Ninth and the Second Circuits observed, Congress has not seen fit to repudiate, limit, or refine
the exception despite its somewhat murky borders and its
obvious tension with the text of the statute as construed in
Bramblett. On the other hand, it is also true that Congress
has not seen fit to overturn the holding in Bramblett, despite
the fact that the opinions endorsing the judicial function exception evidence a good deal of respectful skepticism about
the correctness of that decision.
V
With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to
the difficult stare decisis question that this case presents.
It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier cases. As Justice Cardozo reminded us:
"The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every
case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the
secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone
before him." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process
149 (1921). Adherence to precedent also serves an indispensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.
Stare decisis is "a basic self-governing principle within the
Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and
difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential
system that is not based upon 'an arbitrary discretion."'
Pattersonv. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.164, 172 (1989)
(quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888)
(A. Hamilton)). See also Planned Parenthoodof Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.833, 854-855 (1992) (joint opinion
of O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, JJ.). Respect for
precedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction,
where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S.
720, 736 (1977)."
In this case, these considerations point in two conflicting
directions. On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of §1001 adopted in Bramblett; on the other, they
argue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back
on the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.
It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.
For if the word "department" encompasses the Judiciary, as
Bramblett stated, 348 U. S., at 509, the judicial function
exception cannot be squared with the text of the statute.
A court is a court-and is part of the Judicial Branchwhether it is functioning in a housekeeping or judicial capacity. Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preserved
the thrust of the judicial function exception-i. e., if we interpreted 18 U. S. C. § 1001 so that it did not reach conduct
occurring in federal-court proceedings. Again, although
Bramblett involved a false representation to an office within
the Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all three
branches together in one and the same breath. See 384
U. S., at 509 ("department" in § 1001 "was meant to describe
the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the
Government").
1See also, e. g., Pattersonv. McLean Credit Union,491 U. S., at 172-173
(staredecisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for
here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative
power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have
done"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S.
409, 424 (1986) (noting "the strong presumption of continued validity that
adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute"); Runyon v. McCrary,

decided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S.393, 406 (1932)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting) ("Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because
in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be
settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true, even where
the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had
by legislation") (citation omitted).

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

We think the text of § 1001 forecloses any argument that
we should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception. We are, however, persuaded that
the clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of Bramblett.12 Although such a reconsideration is appropriate only
in the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits
it because of a highly unusual "intervening development of
the law," see Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173, and because of
the absence of significant reliance interests in adhering to
Bramblett.
The "intervening development" is, of course, the judicial
function exception. In a virtually unbroken line of cases,
respected federal judges have interpreted § 1001 so narrowly
that it has had only a limited application within the Judicial
Branch. See nn. 2 and 10, supra. This interpretation has
roots both deep and broad in the lower courts. Although
the judicial function exception has not been adopted by this
Court, our review of Bramblett supports the conclusion that
the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the
intent of Congress. It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a "competing legal doctrin[e]," Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173, that can lay a legitimate claim to
respect as a settled body of law. Overruling Bramblett
would preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, to
13
that extent, promote stability in the law.
12

Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely
to Bramblett, we find no merit in the Government's suggestion that a
reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the
question on which we granted certiorari. See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,513 U. S.374, 379-383 (1995).
IsThe dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will "induce" federal
judges on the courts of appeals to "ignore" precedents from this Court
and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system. Post, at 721. We would
have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents. Indeed, the dissents dire prediction is at odds with its own observation that "no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of STEVENS, J.
Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens
"have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this
instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled
rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative
response." Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways
Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); see also Casey, 505 U. S.,
at 854-856 (joint opinion of O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SouTER, JJ.). Here, however, the reliance interests at stake in
adhering to Bramblett are notably modest. In view of the

extensive array of statutes that already exist to penalize
false statements within the Judicial Branch, see, e. g., 18
U. S. C. § 1621 (perjury); § 1623 (false declarations before
grand jury or court); § 1503 (obstruction of justice); §287
(false claims against the United States), we doubt that prosecutors have relied on § 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct. 14 But we
need not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point.
The United States Attorneys' Manual states quite plainly
that "[p]rosecutions should not be brought under 18 U. S. C.
§ 1001 for false statements submitted in federal court proceedings"; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under the
perjury or obstruction of justice statutes. U. S. Dept. of
of a higher court," see post, at 720. In concluding that the cases adopting
the judicial function exception are faithful to the intent of the Legislature
that adopted § 1001, we have obviously exercised our own independent
judgment. Thus, far from "subvert[ing] the very principle on which a
hierarchical court system is built," post, at 719, our decision merely reflects our assessment of the statutory construction issue this case presents, while serving what the dissent acknowledges to be one of the central purposes of stare decisis: promoting "stability and certainty in the
law," post, at 720.
14The perjury and false claims statutes also cover the Legislative
Branch, as does 18 U. S. C. § 1505 (obstruction of justice). The existence
of overlaps with other statutes does not itself militate in favor of overruling Bramblett;Congress may, and often does, enact separate criminal statutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same conduct. See United
States v. Batchelder,442 U. S., at 123-124; United States v. Gilliland,312
U. S.86, 95 (1941). The overlaps here simply demonstrate that prosecutors cannot be said to have any significant reliance interest in Bramblett.

Opinion of the Court

Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual 9-69.267 (1992).
Clearer evidence of nonreliance can scarcely be imagined. 1
Similarly unimpressive is the notion of congressional reliance on Bramblett. The longstanding judicial function exception has, to a large extent, negated the actual application
of § 1001 within the Judiciary. It is unlikely that Congress
has relied on what has, for many years, been an unfulfilled
promise.
In sum, although the stare decisis issue in this case is difficult, we conclude that there are sound reasons to correct
Bramblett's erroneous construction of § 1001. Although we
could respect prior decisions by endorsing the judicial function exception or by adhering to Bramblett while repudiating that exception, we believe coherence and stability in the
law will best be served in this case by taking a different
course. Limiting the coverage of § 1001 to the area plainly
marked by its text will, as a practical matter, preserve the
interpretation of § 1001 that has prevailed for over 30 years
and will best serve the administration of justice in the future.
VI
Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal
court is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within the
meaning of § 1001. The Court of Appeals' decision is therefore reversed to the extent that it upheld petitioner's convictions under § 1001.
It is so ordered.
16The absence of significant reliance interests is confirmed by an examination of statistical data regarding actual cases brought under § 1001.

The Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over
the last five fiscal years, see post, at 722, but the dissent can identify only
five reported § 1001 cases in that time period brought in connection with
false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislature.

Post, at 723,

n. (At least two of the five were unsuccessful, from the Government's
point of view.) This tiny handful of prosecutions does not, in our view,
evidence a weighty reliance interest on the part of prosecutors in adhering
to the interpretation of § 1001 set forth in Bramblett.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join Parts I-III
and VI of JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion. United States v.
Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), should be overruled.
The doctrine of stare decisis protects the legitimate expectations of those who live under the law, and, as Alexander
Hamilton observed, is one of the means by which exercise
of "an arbitrary discretion in the courts" is restrained, The
Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Who ignores
it must give reasons, and reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong (otherwise
the doctrine would be no doctrine at all).
The reason here, as far as I am concerned, is the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett has unacceptable consequences, which can be judicially avoided (absent overruling)
only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that is irrational or
by importing exceptions with no basis in law. Unlike JusTICE STEVENS, I do not regard the Courts of Appeals' attempts to limit Bramblett as an "'intervening development
of the law,"' ante, at 713 (quoting Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989)), that puts us to a
choice between two conflicting lines of authority. Such "intervening developments" by lower courts that we do not
agree with are ordinarily disposed of by reversal. See, e. g.,
McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987). Instead, the
significance I find in the fact that so many Courts of Appeals
have strained so mightily to discern an exception that the
statute does not contain, see ante, at 699, n. 2 (collecting
cases), is that it demonstrates how great a potential for mischief federal judges have discovered in the mistaken reading
of 18 U. S. C. § 1001, a potential we did not fully appreciate
when Bramblett was decided. To be sure, since 18 U. S. C.
§ 1001's prohibition of concealment is violated only when

there exists a duty to disclose, see, e. g., United States v.
Kingston, 971 F. 2d 481, 489 (CA10 1992); United States v.
Richeson, 825 F. 2d 17,20 (CA4 1987); United States v. Irwin,
654 F. 2d 671, 678-679 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S.
1016 (1982), it does not actually prohibit any legitimate trial
tactic. There remains, however, a serious concern that the
threat of criminal prosecution under the capacious provisions
of § 1001 will deter vigorous representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation
of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control the machinery of § 1001 prosecution.
One could avoid the problem by accepting the Courts of
Appeals' invention of a "judicial function" exception, but
there is simply no basis in the text of the statute for that.
Similarly unprincipled would be rejecting Bramblett's dictum that § 1001 applies to the courts, while adhering to
Bramblett's holding that § 1001 applies to Congress. This
would construct a bizarre regime in which "department"
means the Executive and Legislative Branches, but not the
Judicial, thereby contradicting not only the statute's intent
(as Bramblett does), but, in addition, all conceivable interpretations of the English language. Neither of these solutions
furthers the goal of avoiding "an arbitrary discretion in the
courts"; they seem to me much more arbitrary than simply
overruling a wrongly decided case.
The other goal of stare decisis, preserving justifiable expectations, is not much at risk here. Those whose reliance
on Bramblett induced them to tell the truth to Congress or
the courts, instead of lying, have no claim on our solicitude.
Some convictions obtained under Bramblett may have to be
overturned, and in a few instances wrongdoers may go free
who could have been prosecuted and convicted under a different statute if Bramblett had not been assumed to be the
law. I count that a small price to pay for the uprooting of
this weed.

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

with whom JUSTICE O'CON-

NOR and JUSTICE SOUTER join, dissenting.

The bankruptcy trustee objected to the discharge of petitioner, a voluntary bankrupt, believing that he had filed false
information. The trustee filed a complaint under 11 U. S. C.
§727, alleging petitioner stored a well-drilling machine at his
residence; petitioner answered by denyingthe allegation "for
the reason that it is untrue." App. 12, 10. The trustee
also alleged in a separate motion that petitioner had, despite
requests, failed to turn over all the books and records relating to the bankruptcy estate. Petitioner filed a response denying the allegation, and asserting that he had produced the
requested documents at the behest of a previous trustee.
Petitioner was then indicted under 18 U. S. C. § 1001, and a
jury found that each of these responses was a lie.
Today, the majority jettisons a 40-year-old unanimous decision of this Court, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503
(1955), under which petitioner's conviction plainly would
have been upheld. It does so despite an admission that the
Court's reading of § 1001 in Bramblett was "not completely
implausible," ante, at 706. In replacing Bramblett's plausible, albeit arguably flawed, interpretation of the statute with
its own "sound" reading, the Court disrespects the traditionally stringent adherence to stare decisis in statutory decisions. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,
172 (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736
(1977). The two reasons offered by the plurality in Part V
of the opinion and the justification offered by the concurring
opinion fall far short of the institutional hurdle erected by
our past practice against overruling a decision of this Court
interpreting an Act of Congress.
The first reason is styled as an "intervening development
in the law"; under it, decisions of Courts of Appeals that cannot be reconciled with our earlier precedent are treated as a
basis for disavowing, not the aberrant Court of Appeals deci-

REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting

sions, but, mirabile dictu our own decision! This novel corollary to the principle of stare decisis subverts the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built. The second reason given is that there has been little or no reliance
on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite
debatable, if not actually erroneous.
Today's decision harkens to the important reason behind
the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it. That doctrine is "a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial
Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult
task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system
Patterson,
that is not based upon 'an arbitrary discretion.'
supra, at 172, citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge
ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton). Respect for precedent is strongest
"in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is
free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation."
Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736. Justice Brandeis' dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S.
393 (1932), made the point this way:
"Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most
matters it is more important that the applicable rule of
law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious
concern, provided correction can be had by legislation."
Id., at 406 (citations omitted).
We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called "intervening developments in
the law." But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g.,
Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320
(1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/AmericanExpress,
Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the
"intervening developments" were in the case law of this
Court, not of the lower federal courts. Indeed, in Illinois
Brick Co., we refused to follow a line of lower court decisions

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
REHNQUIST,

C. J., dissenting

which had carved out an exception from one of our precedents. 431 U. S., at 743-744.
But today's decision departs radically from the previously
limited reliance on this exception. The principle of stare decisis is designed to promote stability and certainty in the
law. While most often invoked to justify a court's refusal to
reconsider its own decisions, it applies a fortiori to enjoin
lower courts to follow the decision of a higher court. This
principle is so firmly established in our jurisprudence that
no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision of a higher court. But cases come in all shapes and
varieties, and it is not always clear whether a precedent applies to a situation in which some of the facts are different
from those in the decided case. Here lower courts must necessarily make judgments as to how far beyond its particular
facts the higher court precedent extends.
If there is appeal as a matter of right from the lower court
to the higher court, any decision by the lower court that is
viewed as mistaken by the higher court will in the normal
course of events be corrected in short order by reversal on
appeal. But in the present day federal court system, where
review by this Court is almost entirely discretionary, a different regime prevails. We receive nearly 7,000 petitions
for certiorari every Term, and can grant only a tiny fraction
of them. A high degree of selectivity is thereby enjoined
upon us in exercising our certiorari jurisdiction, and our
Rule 10 embodies the standards by which we decide to grant
review. One of the reasons contained in Rule 10.1(a) is the
existence of a conflict between one court of appeals and another. The negative implication of this ground, borne out
time and again in our decisions to grant and deny certiorari,
is that ordinarily a court of appeals decision interpreting one
of our precedents-even one deemed to be arguably inconsistent with it-will not be reviewed unless it conflicts with a
decision of another court of appeals. This fact is a necessary
concomitant of the limited capacity in this Court.

Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
REHNQUIST,

C. J., dissenting

One of the consequences of this highly selective standard
for granting review is that this Court is deprived of a very
important means of assuring that the courts of appeals adhere to its precedents. It is all the more important, therefore, that no actual inducements to ignore these precedents
be offered to the courts of appeals. But today's decision is
just such an inducement; it tells courts of appeals that if they
build up a body of case law contrary to ours, their case law
will serve as a basis for overruling our precedent. It is difficult to imagine a more topsy-turvy doctrine than this, or
one more likely to unsettle established legal rules that the
doctrine of stare decisis is designed to protect.
The plurality attempts to bolster this aspect of its opinion
by blandly assuring us that "the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress." Ante,
at 713. Members of Congress will surely be surprised by
this statement. Congress has not amended or considered
amending § 1001 in the 40 years since Bramblett was decided.
We have often noted the danger in relying on congressional
inaction in construing a statute, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507
U. S. 619, 632 (1993), citing Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline
Co., 485 U. S. 293, 306 (1988), but even there the "inaction"
referred to is a failure of Congress to enact a particular
proposal. Here there was not even any proposal before
Congress.
If we delve more deeply into the hypothetical thought
processes of a very diligent Member of Congress who made
a specialty of following cases construing § 1001, the Member
would undoubtedly know of our decision in Bramblett 40
years ago. If he also followed decisions of the courts of
appeals, he would know that in various forms-whether a
"judicial function" exception or an "exculpatory no" ruleseveral Courts of Appeals have held § 1001 inapplicable to
some statements made in the course of judicial proceedings.
If, after due deliberation, he concluded that this exception
was inconsistent with our opinion in Bramblett, he would

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
REHNQUIST,

C. J., dissenting

surely also realize that in due course, on the assumption that
the Judiciary was functioning as it should, the Supreme
Court would itself decide that the exception was inconsistent
with Bramblett, and disavow the exception. But of one
thing he would have been in no doubt: that under Bramblett
one who lied to an officer of Congress was punishable under
§ 1001, since that was the precise holding of Bramblett. But
it is that very justifiable expectation of Congress that is
set at naught by today's decision, under which the legislative process is no longer protected by § 1001.
The plurality offers a second reason in defense of its decision to overrule Bramblett. It points to a lack of significant
reliance interests in Bramblett. It dispels any reliance
prosecutors might have in enforcement of § 1001 by arguing
that the Government has expressed a preference for proceeding under alternative statutes that punish comparable
behavior. U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys'

20, and n. 9. I do not think the Government disclaims reliance by adopting a defensive litigating strategy in response
to the choice of lower courts to disregard precedent favorable
to the Government. And in this particular case, the perjury
alternative in 18 U. S. C. § 1621 was altogether unavailable
to punish petitioner's falsehoods because his statements
were not verified, and the obstruction of justice alternative
in 18 U. S. C. § 1503 was of dubious utility.
Statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts indicate that the Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last
five fiscal years. Because the Administrative Office does not
break down its statistics by type of agency to which the defendant made a false statement, further exploration of the

subject must be limited to published decisions. It is unclear
what proportion of these cases involved false statements
made to the Legislative or Judicial Branch, but it appears
that the Government has attempted to proceed under § 1001
for false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislature
with mixed success.* To the extent it has secured valid convictions in some courts in reliance on Bramblett, the Government should not now be forced to endure requests for habeas
relief that will inevitably be filed in the wake of the Court's
opinion.
The additional comments set forth in the concurring opinion equally disregard the respect due a unanimous decision
rendered by six Justices who took the same oath of office
sworn by the six Justices who overrule Bramblett today.
The doctrine of stare decisis presumes to reinforce the notion
that justice is dispensed according to law and not to serve

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
REHNQUIST, C. J.,

dissenting

"the proclivities of individuals." Vasquez v. Hillery, 474
U. S. 254, 265 (1986). The opinion of one Justice that another's view of a statute was wrong, even really wrong, does
not overcome the institutional advantages conferred by adherence to stare decisis in cases where the wrong is fully
redressable by a coordinate branch of government.
This, then, is clearly a case where it is better that the
matter be decided than that it be decided right. Bramblett
governs this case, and if the rule of that case is to be. overturned it should be at the hands of Congress, and not of
this Court.
