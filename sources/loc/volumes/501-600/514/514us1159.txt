LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, D. C.
APRIL

27, 1995

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled:
By direction of the Supreme Court of the United States, I
have the honor to submit to the Congress the amendments
to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that have been
adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant
to Section 2072 of Title 28, United States Code. To maintain
uniformity between revised and unrevised Rules, the Court
has edited the amendments transmitted to the Supreme
Court by the Judicial Conference of the United States to use
the word "shall" in a consistent manner.
The rules are accompanied by an excerpt from the report
of the Judicial Conference of the United States' Committee
on Rules of Practice and Procedure and that Committee's
Advisory Committee Notes. In order to minimize confusion,
a footnote noting the changes made by the Supreme Court
has been added to the marked-up version of the proposed
amendments that accompanies the Advisory Committee
Notes.
Sincerely,
(Signed) WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
Chief Justice of the United States

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
APRIL 27, 1995
ORDERED:

Rules 5, 40, 43, 49, and 57.
[See infra, pp. 1163-1166.]
2. That the foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 1995,
and shall govern all proceedings in criminal cases thereafter
commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings in criminal cases then pending.
3. That THE CHIEF JUSTICE be, and hereby is, authorized

to transmit to the Congress the foregoing amendments to
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2072 of Title 28, United States
Code.

AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES
OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Rule 5. Initial appearance before the magistratejudge.
(a) In general.-Except as otherwise provided in this
rule, an officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon
a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary
delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge
or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by
18 U. S. C. §3041. If a person arrested without a warrant
is brought before a magistrate judge, a complaint, satisfying the probable cause requirements of Rule 4(a), shall be
promptly filed. When a person, arrested with or without
a warrant or given a summons, appears initially before the
magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of this rule. An
officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint charging solely a violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1073 need
not comply with this rule if the person arrested is transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of appropriate state or local authorities in the district of arrest
and an attorney for the government moves promptly, in the
district in which the warrant was issued, to dismiss the
complaint.
Rule 40. Commitment to another district.
(a) Appearance before federal magistrate judge.-If a
person is arrested in a district other than that in which the
offense is alleged to have been committed, that person shall
be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge, in accordance with the provi1163

1164

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

sions of Rule 5. Preliminary proceedings concerning the defendant shall be conducted in accordance with Rules 5 and
5.1, except that if no preliminary examination is held because
an indictment has been returned or an information filed or
because the defendant elects to have the preliminary examination conducted in the district in which the prosecution is
pending, the person shall be held to answer upon a finding
that such person is the person named in the indictment, information or warrant. If held to answer, the defendant shall
be held to answer in the district court in which the prosecution is pending-provided that a warrant is issued in that
district if the arrest was made without a warrant-upon
production of the warrant or a certified copy thereof. The
warrant or certified copy may be produced by facsimile
transmission.
Rule 43. Presence of the defendant.
(a) Presence required.-The defendant shall be present at
the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at every stage of
the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return
of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as
otherwise provided by this rule.
(b) Continued presence not required.-The further progress of the trial to and including the return of the verdict,
and the imposition of sentence, will not be prevented and the
defendant will be considered to have waived the right to be
present whenever a defendant, initially present at trial, or
having pleaded guilty or nolo contendere,
(1) is voluntarily absent after the trial has commenced (whether or not the defendant has been informed by the court of the obligation to remain during
the trial),
(2) in a noncapital case, is voluntarily absent at the
imposition of sentence, or
(3) after being warned by the court that disruptive
conduct will cause the removal of the defendant from
the courtroom, persists in conduct which is such as to
justify exclusion from the courtroom.

(c) Presence not required.-A defendant need not be
present:
(1) when represented by counsel and the defendant
is an organization, as defined in 18 U. S. C. § 18;
(2) when the offense is punishable by fine or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both, and the
court, with the written consent of the defendant, permits arraignment, plea, trial, and imposition of sentence
in the defendant's absence;
(3) when the proceeding involves only a conference or
hearing upon a question of law; or
(4) when the proceeding involves a correction of
sentence under Rule 35.
Rule 49. Service and filing of papers.
(e) Filing of dangerous offender notice.-(Abrogated
April 27, 1995, eff. December 1, 1995.)
Rule 57. Rules by district courts.
(a) In general.
(1) Each district court acting by a majority of its district judges may, after giving appropriate public notice
and an opportunity to comment, make and amend rules
governing its practice. A local rule shall be consistent
with-but not duplicative of-Acts of Congress and
rules adopted under 28 U. S. C. § 2072 and shall conform
to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the
Judicial Conference of the United States.
(2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall
not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose
rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with
the requirement.
(b) Procedure when there is no controlling law.-A judge
may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal
law, these rules, and local rules of the district. No sanction
or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance
with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or

1166

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

the local district rules unless the alleged violator has been
furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the
requirement.
(c) Effective date and notice.-A local rule so adopted
shall take effect upon the date specified by the district court
and shall remain in effect unless amended by the district
court or abrogated by the judicial council of the circuit in
which the district is located. Copies of the rules and amendments so made by any district court shall upon their promulgation be furnished to the judicial council and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and shall be made
available to the public.
