ARBITRATION ACT.
1. Arbitrability decision-Standardof review.-Court of Appeals was
correct (1) in finding that, because parties did not agree to submit arbitrability question to arbitration, arbitrability decision was subject to independent review by courts, and (2) in applying ordinary standards when
reviewing District Court's arbitrability decision. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, p. 938.
2. Punitive damages award-Privatearbitrationagreement-Choiceof-law provision.-Lower federal courts erred in reading choice-of-law
provision and arbitration provision in parties' standard-form contract as
conflicting and therefore not enforcing an arbitration panel's award of punitive damages to petitioner. Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Inc., p. 52.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Commerce Clause.
1. Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990-Impact of firearms possession
on interstate commerce.-Act, which prohibits knowing possession of a
firearm in a school zone, exceeds Congress' authority under Commerce
Clause because possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an
economic activity that might have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. United States v. Lopez, p. 549.

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
2. State tax-Sale of transportationservices.-Oklahoma'ssales tax on
full price of a ticket for bus travel from Oklahoma to another State is
consistent with Commerce Clause. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson
Lines, Inc., p. 175.
II. Due Process.
Murder trial-State's withholding of exculpatory evidence.-Because
net effect of evidence favoring petitioner that was withheld by Louisiana
at his capital murder trial raises a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have produced a different result, his conviction cannot stand
under Brady v. Maryland,373 U. S. 83, and United States v. Bagley, 473
U. S. 667. Kyles v. Whitley, p. 419.
III. Ex Post Facto Laws.
State parole law-Application of amendment.-Application of an
amendment to California's parole law-which allowed parole board to decrease frequency of parole suitability hearings-to prisoners who committed their crimes before lawwas enacted does not violate Ex Post Facto
Clause. California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, p. 499.
IV. Freedom of Speech.
1. Commercial speech-Display of alcohol content on beer labels.Section 5(e)(2) of Federal Alcohol Administration Act, which prohibits beer
labels from displaying alcohol content, violates First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., p. 476.
2. Elections-Distributionof campaign literature.-An Ohio statute
prohibiting distribution of anonymous campaign literature abridges freedom of speech in violation of First Amendment. McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, p. 334.
V. Qualifications Clauses.
Members of Congress-Term limitations.-An amendment to Arkansas
Constitution prohibiting a congressional incumbent's name from appearing on a general election ballot if he or she has already served three terms
in United States House of Representatives or two in United States Senate violates Qualifications Clauses of Federal Constitution. U. S. Term
Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, p. 779.
VI. Searches and Seizures.
1. Exclusionary rule-Clericalerrors.-Exclusionary rule does not require suppression of evidence seized in violation of Fourth Amendment
where erroneous information relied on by arresting officer resulted from
court employees' clerical errors. Arizona v. Evans, p. 1.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
2. Reasonableness-Knock-and-announceprinciple.-Common-law
principle requiring police to announce their presence and authority before
breaking open a dwelling's doors forms a part of Fourth Amendment inquiry into a search's reasonableness. Wilson v. Arkansas, p. 927.
VII. Separation of Powers.
Securities Exchange Act of 1984-Legislative interference in courts'
final judgments.-Section 27A(b) of Act-which provides for reinstatement on motion of any action commenced before, but dismissed as time
barred under, this Court's decision in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &
Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350-contravenes Constitution's separation of powers to extent that it requires federal courts to reopen final
judgments in private ยง 10(b) civil actions. Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,
Inc., p. 211.
VIII. Supremacy Clause.
Limitations periods-State tolling statute.-Supremacy Clause bars
Ohio from applying a tolling statute found unconstitutional in Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises,Inc., 486 U. S. 888, to tort claims
that accrued before date of that decision. Reynoldsville Casket Co. v.

any time to amend plan sets forth an amendment procedure that satisfies
ERISA ยง402(b)(3). Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, p. 73.
2. Pre-emptionof state law--Surcharges on Health Maintenance Organizations and hospital patients.-ERISA does not pre-empt a New York
statute that requires hospitals to collect surcharges from HMO's and from
patients covered by commercial insurers, but not from patients covered
by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. New York State Conference of Blue
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., p. 645.
