REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. ET AL. V. HYDE
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO
No. 94-3.

Argued February 27, 1995-Decided May 15, 1995

More than three years after respondent Hyde was in an accident in Ohio
with a truck owned by a Pennsylvania company, she filed suit in an Ohio
county court against the company and the truck's driver, petitioners
herein. The suit was timely under an Ohio provision that tolls the running of the State's 2-year statute of limitations in lawsuits against outof-state defendants. However, while her case was pending, this Court,
in Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises,Inc., 486 U. S. 888,
held that the tolling provision places an unconstitutional burden upon
interstate commerce. The county court dismissed her suit as untimely,
but it was ultimately reinstated by the State Supreme Court, which
held that Bendix could not be applied retroactively to bar claims that
had accrued prior to the announcement of that decision.
Held: The Supremacy Clause bars Ohio from applying its tolling statute
to pre-Bendix torts. Pp. 752-759.
(a) Hyde acknowledges that this Court, in Harper v. Virginia Dept.
of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97, held that, when it decides a case and applies the new legal rule of that case to the parties before it, then it and
other courts must treat the same rule as "retroactive," applying it, for
example, to pending cases, whether or not they involve predecision
events. She thereby concedes that Bendix applies to her case and retroactively invalidated the tolling provision that makes her suit timely.
She argues instead that the issue here is not one of retroactivity, and
that the Ohio Supreme Court's action is permissible because all that
court has done is to fashion a remedy that takes into consideration her
reliance on pre-Bendix law. Pp. 752-753.
(b) There are serious problems with Hyde's argument. The Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus (the legally authoritative statement of its holding) speaks, not about remedy, but about retroactivity. That court's
refusal to dismiss her suit on the ground that she may have reasonably
relied upon pre-Bendix law is the very sort of justification that this
Court, in Harper,found insufficient to deny retroactive application of a
new legal rule. She correctly notes that, as courts apply "retroactively" a new rule of law to pending cases, they may find instances
where the new rule, for well-established legal reasons, does not determine the outcome of the case. However, this case involves no instance
or special circumstance that might somehow justify the result she seeks.

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. v. HYDE
Opinion of the Court
It does not concern (1) an alternative way of curing the constitutional
violation; or (2) a previously existing, independent legal basis for denying relief, see, e. g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages
and 7bbacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 40-41; or
(3) a well-established general legal rule, such as qualified immunity, that
trumps the new rule of law, which general rule reflects both reliance
interests and other significant policy justifications, see, e. g., Harlow v.
Fitzgerald,457 U. S. 800, 818; or (4) a principle of law that limits the
principle of retroactivity itself, see Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. Hyde
has offered no more than simple reliance as a basis for creating an exception to Harper's retroactivity rule and has conceded that Harper
governs this case. Her concession means that she cannot prevail.

JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Bendix Autolite Corp. V. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.,
486 U. S. 888 (1988), this Court held unconstitutional (as im-

permissibly burdening interstate commerce) an Ohio "tolling" provision that, in effect, gave Ohio tort plaintiffs unlimited time to sue out-of-state (but not in-state) defendants.
Subsequently, in the case before us, the Supreme Court of
*Irene C. Keyse-Walker fied a brief for the Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust as amicus curiae urging reversal.
Briefs of amici curiaeurging affirmance were filed for the State of Ohio
by Lee Fisher,Attorney General, RichardA Cordray,State Solicitor, and
Simon B. Karas; and for Brown & Szaller Co., L. P. A., et al. by James
F Szaller,Robert A Marcis, Larry S. Stewart, and Jeffrey R. White.

Opinion of the Court

Ohio held that, despite Bendix, Ohio's tolling law continues
to apply to tort claims that accrued before that decision.
This holding, in our view, violates the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. We therefore reverse the Ohio Supreme
Court's judgment.
The accident that led to this case, a collision between a car
and a truck, occurred in Ashtabula County, Ohio, on March
5, 1984. More than three years later, on August 11, 1987,
Carol Hyde (respondent here) sued the truck's driver, John
Blosh, and its owner, Reynoldsville Casket Company (petitioners). All parties concede that, had Blosh and Reynoldsville made their home in Ohio, Ohio law would have given
Hyde only two years to bring her lawsuit. See Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. ยง 2305.10 (1991). But, because petitioners were
from Pennsylvania, a special provision of Ohio law tolled the
running of the statute of limitations, making the lawsuit
timely. See ยง 2305.15(A) (tolling the statute of limitations
while a person against whom "a cause of action accrues" is
"out of" or "departs from" the State).
Ten months after Hyde brought her suit, this Court, in
Bendix, supra, held that the tolling provision on which
she relied, ยง 2305.15(A), places an unconstitutional burden
upon interstate commerce. Soon thereafter, the Ashtabula
County Court of Common Pleas, finding this case indistinguishable from Bendix, held that the tolling provision could
not constitutionally be applied to the case, and dismissed the
lawsuit as untimely. The intermediate appellate state court
affirmed the dismissal. However, the Ohio Supreme Court
reinstated the suit. Its syllabus, which under Ohio law sets
forth the authoritative basis for its decision, see Ohio Supreme Court Rules for the Reporting of Opinions Rule 1(B)
(1994-1995); Akers v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 31 Ohio St. 3d 78,
79, n. 1, 508 N. E. 2d 964, 965, n. 1 (1987), simply says, "Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.... may
not be retroactively applied to bar claims in state courts
which had accrued prior to the announcement of that deci-

Opinion of the Court

sion. (Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution, applied.)"
68 Ohio St. 3d 240, 240-241, 626 N. E. 2d 75 (1994). We
granted certiorari to decide whether the Federal Constitution permits Ohio to continue to apply its tolling statute to
pre-Bendix torts. And, as we have said, we conclude that
it does not.
Hyde acknowledges that this Court, in Harperv. Virginia
Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S.86, 97 (1993), held that, when (1)
the Court decides a case and applies the (new) legal rule of
that case to the parties before it, then (2) it and other courts
must treat that same (new) legal rule as "retroactive," applying it, for example, to all pending cases, whether or not those
cases involve predecision events. She thereby concedes
that, the Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus to the contrary notwithstanding, Bendix applies to her case. And, she says, as
"a result of Harper,there is no question that Bendix retroactively invalidated" the tolling provision that makes her suit
timely. Brief for Respondent 8.
Although one might think that is the end of the matter,
Hyde ingeniously argues that it is not. She asks us to look
at what the Ohio Supreme Court has done, not through the
lens of "retroactivity," but through that of "remedy."
States, she says, have a degree of legal leeway in fashioning
remedies for constitutional ills. She points to Chevron Oil
Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S.97 (1971), in which this Court applied
prospectively only its ruling that a 1-year statute of limitations governed certain tort cases-primarily because that
ruling had "effectively overruled a long line of decisions"
applying a more generous limitations principle (that of
laches), upon which plaintiffs had reasonably relied. Id., at
107. She concedes that Harperoverruled Chevron Oil insofar as the case (selectively) permitted the prospective-only
application of a new rule of law. But, she notes the possibility of recharacterizing Chevron Oil as a case in which the
Court simply took reliance interests into account in tailoring
an appropriate remedy for a violation of federal law. See

Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

Harper,supra, at 133-134 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 218-225
(1990) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

And she quotes Justice

Harlan, who, before Chevron Oil, pointed out that "equitable
considerations" such as "'reliance"' might prove relevant to
"relief." United States v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S. 286,
296-297 (1970) (concurring opinion).
Thus, Hyde asks, why not look at what the Ohio Supreme
Court has done in this case as if it were simply an effort to
fashion a remedy that takes into consideration her reliance
on pre-Bendix law? Here, the remedy would actually consist of providing no remedy for the constitutional violation
or, to put the matter more precisely, of continuing to toll the
2-year statute of limitations in pre-Bendix cases, such as
hers, as a state law "equitable" device for reasons of reliance
and fairness. She claims that use of this device violates no
federal constitutional provision (such as the Due Process
Clause) and is therefore permissible.
One serious problem with Hyde's argument lies in the
Ohio Supreme Court's legal description of why, in fact, it
refused to dismiss Hyde's case. As we have pointed out,
the Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus (the legally authoritative
statement of its holding) speaks, not about remedy, but about
retroactivity. Regardless, we do not see how, in the circumstances before us, the Ohio Supreme Court could change a
legal outcome that federal law, applicable under the Supremacy Clause, would otherwise dictate simply by calling its refusal to apply that federal law an effort to create a remedy.
The Ohio Supreme Court's justification for refusing to dismiss Hyde's suit is that she, and others like her, may have
reasonably relied upon pre-Bendix law-a reliance of the
same kind and degree as that involved in Chevron Oil.
But, this type of justification--often present when prior law
is overruled-is the very sort that this Court, in Harper,
found insufficient to deny retroactive application of a new
legal rule (that had been applied in the case that first an-

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. v. HYDE
Opinion of the Court

nounced it). If Harper has anything more than symbolic
significance, how could virtually identical reliance, without
more, prove sufficient to permit a virtually identical denial
simply because it is characterized as a denial based on "remedy" rather than "nonretroactivity"?
Hyde tries to answer this question by pointing to other
cases in which, she claims, this Court has allowed state
courts effectively to avoid retroactive application of federal
law by denying a particular remedy for violation of that law
or by refusing to provide any remedy at all. She argues
that these cases are similar enough to her own to permit a
"remedial" exception to the retroactive application of Bendix. We have examined the cases to which Hyde looks for
support, and conclude that they all involve very different
circumstances.
First, Hyde points to a statement in the opinion announcing the Court's judgment in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.
Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), that once "a rule is found to
apply 'backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule
should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded
if the rule had been an old one." Id., at 535 (opinion of SouTER, J.); ibid. ("Subject to possible constitutional thresholds,
... the remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at
least where the case originates in state court"); American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 178 (opinion of
O'CONNOR, J.) (speaking of the need to "distinguish the ques"tion of retroactivity.., from the distinct remedial question");
id., at 210 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (distinguishing "between
retroactivity as a choice-of-law rule and retroactivity as a
remedial principle"). This language, however, read both literally and in context, makes clear that the ordinary application of a new rule of law "backwards," say, to pending cases,
may or may not, involve a further matter of remedies.
Whether it does so, and, if so, what kind of remedy the state
court may fashion, depend-like almost all legal issues-

Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)

Opinion of the Court

upon the kind of case, matter, and circumstances involved.
Not all cases concerning retroactivity and remedies are of
the same sort.
Second, Hyde points to tax cases in which the Court applied retroactively new rules holding certain state tax laws
unconstitutional, but nonetheless permitted the state courts
a degree of leeway in designing a remedy, including a remedy
that would deny state taxpayers, with pending refund cases,
the refund that they sought. See Harperv. Virginia Dept.
of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993); Beam, supra. If state
courts may at the same time apply new law (invalidating tax
statutes) and withhold relief (tax refunds) from tax plaintiffs,
asks Hyde, why can they not at the same time apply new
law (invalidating tolling statutes) and withhold relief (dismissal) from tort defendants?
The answer to this question lies in the special circumstances of the tax cases. The Court has suggested that
some of them involve a particular kind of constitutional violation-a kind that the State could cure without repaying back
taxes. See McKesson Corp. v. Divisionof Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496
U. S.18, 40-41 (1990). Where the violation depends, in critical part, upon differential treatment of two similar classes of
individuals, then one might cure the problem either by similarly burdening, or by similarly unburdening, both groups.
Where the violation stemmed from, say, taxing the retirement funds of one group (retired Federal Government employees) but not those of another (retired state government
employees), see Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489
U. S.803 (1989), then the State might cure the problem either
(1) by taxing both (imposing, say, back taxes on the previously advantaged group, to the extent constitutionally permissible), or (2) by taxing neither (and refunding back taxes).
Cf. McKesson Corp., supra, at 40-41, and n. 23. And, if the
State chooses the first, then the taxpayers need receive no
refund. But, that result flows not from some general "reme-

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. v. HYDE
Opinion of the Court

dial" exception to "retroactivity" law, but simply from the
fact that the state law that the taxpayer had attacked now
satisfies the Constitution.
One can imagine a roughly comparable situation in the
statute of limitations context. Suppose that Ohio violated
the Constitution by treating two similar classes of tort defendants differently, say, by applying a 2-year statute of limitations to the first (in-state defendants) but a 4-year statute
to the second (out-of-state defendants). Ohio might have
cured this (imaginary) constitutional problem either (1) by
applying a 4-year statute to both groups, or (2) by applying
a 2-year statute to both groups. Had it chosen the first of
these remedies, then Hyde's case could continue because the
4-year statute would no longer violate the Federal Constitution. This imaginary case, however, is not the case at hand,
for the Ohio Supreme Court's "remedy" here (allowing Hyde
to proceed) does not cure the tolling statute's problem of
unconstitutionality. And, her tort claim critically depends
upon Ohio tolling law that continues to violate the Commerce Clause.
Other tax examples present different, remedial problems.
Suppose a State collects taxes under a taxing statute that
this Court later holds unconstitutional. Taxpayers then sue
for a refund of the unconstitutionally collected taxes. Retroactive application of the Court's holding would seem to entitle the taxpayers to a refund of taxes. But what if a preexisting, separate, independent rule of state law, having
nothing to do with retroactivity-a rule containing certain
procedural requirements for any refund suit-nonetheless
barred the taxpayers' refund suit? See McKesson Corp.,
supra, at 45; Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S.106, 111 (1994). Depending upon whether or not this independent rule satisfied
other provisions of the Constitution, it could independently
bar the taxpayers' refund claim. See McKesson Corp.,
supra, at 45.

Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

This tax scenario simply reflects the legal commonplace
that, when two different rules of law each independently bar
recovery, then a decision, the retroactive application of which
invalidates one rule, will make no difference to the result.
The other, constitutionally adequate rule remains in place.
Hyde cannot bring her case within the protection of this
principle, for the Ohio Supreme Court did not rest its holding
upon a pre-existing, separate rule of state law (having nothing to do with retroactivity) that independently permitted
her to proceed. Rather, the maintenance of her action critically depends upon the continued application of the Ohio
statute's "tolling" principle--a principle that this Court has
held unconstitutional.
Third, Hyde points to the law of qualified immunity, which,
she says, imposes a "remedial" limitation upon the "retroactive" application of a new rule to pending cases. To understand her argument, consider the following scenario: (1)
Smith sues a police officer claiming injury because of an unconstitutional arrest; (2) the police officer asserts that the
arrest was constitutional; (3) this Court then holds, in a different case, that an identical arrest is not constitutional; (4)
the holding of this different case applies retroactively to
Smith's case; but (5) the police officer still wins on grounds
of qualified immunity because the new rule of law was not
"clearly established" at the time of the arrest. See generally Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U. S.800, 818 (1982). In one
sense, Smith lost for a reason similar to the tax plaintiffs
mentioned above, namely, that a previously existing, separate, constitutional legal ground (that of the law not being
"clearly established") bars her claim. We acknowledge,
however, that this separate legal ground does reflect certain
remedial considerations. In particular, it permits government officials to rely upon old law. But, it does so lest threat
of liability "'dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute,
or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. v. HYDE
Opinion of the Court

discharge of their duties."' Id., at 814 (quoting Gregoire v.
Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949)). And, it reflects the
concern that "society as a whole," without that immunity,
would have to bear "the expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues, and the
deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office."
457 U. S., at 814. These very facts-that a set of special
federal policy considerations have led to the creation of a
well-established, independent rule of law-distinguish the
qualified immunity cases from the case before us, where a
concern about reliance alone has led the Ohio court to create
what amounts to an ad hoc exemption from retroactivity.
Finally, Hyde points to the line of cases starting with
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), in which, she says, this
Court has held that a habeas corpus petitioner cannot obtain
a habeas corpus remedy where doing so would require the
habeas court to apply retroactively a new rule of criminal
law. The Teague doctrine, however, does not involve a special "remedial" limitation on the principle of "retroactivity"
as much as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle
itself. New legal principles, even when applied retroactively, do not apply to cases already closed. Cf. United
States v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S., at 296 (Harlan, J.,
concurring) (at some point, "the rights of the parties should
be considered frozen" and a "conviction . . .final"). And,
much as the qualified immunity doctrine embodies special
federal policy concerns related to the imposition of damages
liability upon persons holding public office, the Teague doctrine embodies certain special concerns-related to collateral
review of state criminal convictions-that affect which cases
are closed, for which retroactivity-related purposes, and
under .what circumstances. No such special finality-related
concerns are present here.
The upshot is that Hyde shows, through her examples, the
unsurprising fact that, as courts apply "retroactively" a new
rule of law to pending cases, they will find instances where

Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)
SCALIA, J.,

concurring

that new rule, for well-established legal reasons, does not
determine the outcome of the case. Thus, a court may find
(1) an alternative way of curing the constitutional violation,
or (2) a previously existing, independent legal basis (having
nothing to do with retroactivity) for denying relief, or (3) as
in the law of qualified immunity, a well-established general
legal rule that trumps the new rule of law, which general
rule reflects both reliance interests and other significant policy justifications, or (4) a principle of law, such as that of
"finality" present in the Teague context, that limits the principle of retroactivity itself. But, this case involves no such
instance; nor does it involve any other special circumstance
that might somehow justify the result Hyde seeks. Rather,
Hyde offers no more than simple reliance (of the sort at issue
in Chevron Oil) as a basis for creating an exception to
Harper's rule of retroactivity-in other words, she claims
that, for no special reason, Harper does not apply. We are
back where we started. Hyde's necessary concession, that
Harpergoverns this case, means that she cannot prevail.

joins,
concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court, which assumes that the
Ohio Supreme Court denied petitioner a "remedy" for the
unconstitutionality of the tolling statute, and refutes the notion that "remedial discretion" would allow that unconstitutionality to be given no effect. That was the theory on
which this case was presented and argued, and it is properly
decided on the same basis.
I write separately, however, to record my doubt that the
case in fact presents any issue of remedies or of remedial
discretion at all. A court does not-in the nature of things
it can not-give a "remedy" for an unconstitutional statute,
since an unconstitutional statute is not in itself a cognizable
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. v. HYDE
SCALIA, J.,

"wrong." (If it were, every citizen would have standing to
challenge every law.) In fact, what a court does with regard
to an unconstitutional law is simply to ignore it. It decides
the case "disregarding the [unconstitutional] law," Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803) (emphasis added),
because a law repugnant to the Constitution "is void, and is
as no law," Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 376 (1880).
Thus, if a plaintiff seeks the return of money taken by the
government in reliance on an unconstitutional tax law, the
court ignores the tax law, finds the taking of the property
therefore wrongful, and provides a remedy. Or if a plaintiff
seeks to enjoin acts, harmful to him, about to be taken by
a government officer under an unconstitutional regulatory
statute, "the court enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the
statute, but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding." Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488-489
(1923) (emphasis added). In such cases, it makes sense to
speak of "remedial discretion."
In the present case, however, ignoring the unconstitutional
statute (which the Ohio courts were bound to do) did not
result in the conclusion that some remedy must be provided
(over which the courts might have some discretion).
Rather, it resulted in the conclusion that the remedy which
the plaintiff sought could not be provided. Respondent's
suit was concededly untimely under the applicable state statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ยง2305.10 (1991). See
ante, at 751. When petitioners moved to dismiss the suit,
respondent replied that the suit was timely by virtue of the
tolling provision, ยง2305.15(A). The tolling provision, however, was unconstitutional, see Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises,Inc., 486 U. S. 888 (1988), and since
it was unconstitutional it "was... as inoperative as if it had
never been passed," Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. Hackett, 228
U. S. 559, 566 (1913).
In contemplation of the law, then, all that the trial court
had before it was a concededly untimely suit, and (absent

Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)

concurring in judgment

some valid Ohio law other than the tolling statute) it had no
alternative but to dismiss. The Court's opinion gives reasons why the Ohio law applied by the Ohio Supreme Court
in this case is in its substance invalid. I add that even the
rubric under which that law was announced is invalid: It has
nothing to do with remedial discretion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,
concurring in the judgment.
We do not read today's opinion to surrender in advance
our authority to decide that in some exceptional cases, courts
may shape relief in light of disruption of important reliance
interests or the unfairness caused by unexpected judicial decisions. We cannot foresee the myriad circumstances in
which the question might arise. In two classes of cases,
courts already take account of these considerations: cases involving qualified immunity, which protects public officials'
reliance on clearly established law, see Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982); and cases applying the Teague bar
which, among other objectives, protects States that rely on
the law existing at the time a conviction becomes final, see
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 310 (1989). Cf. ante, at 758.
As the Court seems to acknowledge, however, there may be
other areas where the importance of the reliance interests
that are disturbed precludes a remedy despite the retroactive application of the new rule. Ante, at 758-759. In my
view, reliance on statutes of limitations falls into that category in certain circumstances, see Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 371-374
(1991) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); id., at 379 (KENNEDY, J.,
dissenting); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496
U. S. 167, 221-222 (1990) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Saint
FrancisCollege v. AI-Khazraji, 481 U. S. 604 (1987); Chevron
Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), consistent with a long
tradition of judicial authority to formulate rules ensuring fair
and predictable enforcement of statutes of limitations, for

instance, through rules pertaining to tolling or waiver. See
American Trucking Assns., Inc., supra, at 221 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (citing Braun v. Sauerwein, 10 Wall. 218, 223
(1870)). When a hard case presents the question of our authority to deny relief in a retroactivity case, that will be soon
enough to resolve it; for the law in this area is, and ought to
be, shaped by the urgent necessities we confront when there
is a strong case to be made for limiting relief despite the
retroactive application of the law.
This is not a case where we need to address the issue
whether a party is entitled to a full remedy in a retroactivity
case, because that question arises only when the right is
predicated upon a new rule of law, see United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 549 (1982), and Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises,Inc., 486 U. S. 888 (1988), did not announce a new rule. In the civil context, a case announces a
new rule of law "either by overruling clear past precedent
on which litigants may have relied,... or by deciding an
issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly
foreshadowed." Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; cf. Teague v.
Lane, supra, at 301 (new rule in criminal context is one not
"dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's
conviction became final"). Respondent could not and does
not attempt to argue that the Bendix decision overruled
clear past precedent. Rather, she asserts its holding was
not clearly foreshadowed. As the Court was explicit to acknowledge in Bendix, however, it was "[a]pplying wellsettled constitutional principles," Bendix, supra, at 889, not
a new legal theory or one that had not been foreshadowed
by other precedents.
In Brown-FormanDistillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 578-579 (1986), the Court identified two modes of analysis to evaluate state statutes under
the Commerce Clause. The Court will consider the statute
invalid without further inquiry when it "directly regulates
or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its

effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state
interests," id., at 579; and it will balance the State's interest
against the burden on interstate commerce when the statute
"has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly," ibid. (citing Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970)). Respondent concedes that the
Pike balancing test is well established but claims its application to the Ohio tolling provision in Bendix was not
predictable.
Her argument fails on two fronts. First, in Bendix the
Court observed the Ohio tolling provision was so blatant an
affront to interstate commerce that it might be considered
invalid without engaging in the balancing test. See 486
U. S., at 891; see also id., at 898 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Second, the balancing test provides a clear and certain standard
in cases such as Bendix, see id., at 894-895; and even if it
did not, the "application of precedent which directly controls
is not the stuff of which new law is made," Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S.86, 112 (1993) (KENNEDY,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see
Wright v. West, 505 U. S.277, 309 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) ("Where the beginning point is a rule
of ... general application, a rule designed for the specific
purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be
the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges
a new rule, one not dictated by precedent"); see also Keene
Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S.200, 215 (1993) (case does
not announce new rule where claims are resolved "under
well-settled law"); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S.481, 496 (1968) (case does not announce new rule unless it indicates "that the issue involved
was novel, that innovative principles were necessary to resolve it, or that the issue had been settled in prior cases in
a manner contrary to the view held by [the Court]").
As "a mere application of... existing precedent," Harper,
supra, at 112 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur-

ring in judgment), Bendix did not "decide .
'an issue of
first impression,"' Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916,
920 (1990) (per curiam) (quoting Chevron Oil, supra,at 106),

Georgia,501 U. S. 529, 556 (1991) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting),
or represent "an avulsive change which caused the current
of the law thereafter to flow between new banks," Hanover
Shoe, supra, at 499.
Bendix did not announce a new rule of law, so I would
reverse on this ground, postponing extended discussion of
reliance interests as they bear upon remedies for a case
which requires us to address that issue.
