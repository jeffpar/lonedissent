REPORTER'S NOTE
The next page is purposely numbered 1001. The numbers between 949
and 1001 were intentionally omitted, in order to make it possible to publish
the orders with permanent page numbers, thus making the official citations available upon publication of the preliminary prints of the United
States Reports.
