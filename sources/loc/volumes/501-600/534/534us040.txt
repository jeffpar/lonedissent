This Court equitably apportioned the North Platte River
among the States of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska in
1945. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 665 (1945). The
Decree was amended pursuant to a stipulation and joint
motion of the parties in 1953. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 345
U. S. 981. In 1986, the State of Nebraska filed suit against
the State of Wyoming. In 1987, Wyoming filed counterclaims against Nebraska. This Court resolved certain
issues on cross-motions for summary judgment in 1993.
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584. In 1995, this Court
granted in part and denied in part Nebraska's motion to
amend its petition, and granted in part and denied in part
Wyoming's motion to amend its counterclaims and to file
cross-claims against the United States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U.S. 1. The parties have agreed upon this
Court's entry of this Modified Decree to a dismissal with
prejudice of all claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims for
which leave to file was or could have been sought in this
case.
The parties to this cause having filed a Final Settlement Stipulation dated March 13, 2001, which includes the
parties' agreement to create the North Platte Decree Committee to assist them in monitoring, administering, and implementing this Modified Decree, and a Joint Motion for
Approval of Stipulation, Modification of Decree, and Dismissal with Prejudice, and the Court being fully advised:
IT IS ORDERED:
That the Final Settlement Stipulation dated March 13,
2001, is hereby approved and adopted;
That all claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims for which
leave to file was or could have been sought in this case are
hereby dismissed with prejudice; and
That the Decree of October 8, 1945, as amended on June
15, 1953, is hereby modified as follows:

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING
Appendix to Decree

I. The State of Colorado, its officers, attorneys, agents,
and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined:
(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water
from the North Platte River and its tributaries for the irrigation of more than a total of 145,000 acres of land in Jackson
County, Colorado, during any one irrigation season;
(b) From storing or permitting the storage of more than a
total amount of 17,000 acre-feet of water for irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and its tributaries in
Jackson County, Colorado, between October 1 of any year
and September 30 of the following year;
(c) From exporting out of the basin of the North Platte
River and its tributaries in Jackson County, Colorado, to
any other stream basin or basins more than 60,000 acre-feet
of water in any period of ten consecutive years reckoned
in continuing progressive series beginning with October 1,
1945.
II. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents,
and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined:
(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water
for irrigation from the North Platte River and its tributaries,
including water from hydrologically connected groundwater
wells, upstream of Pathfinder Dam for the consumption in
any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing
progressive series, of more than the largest amount of water
consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. This
injunction becomes effective the first full calendar year after
the date of entry of this Modified Decree. The consumptive
use of irrigation water in this area to be counted under this
injunction shall include the following:
(1) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with surface water diversions of natural flow;
(2) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with water stored pursuant to paragraph HI(e);

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

(3) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated by water from hydrologically connected groundwater
wells;
(4) Water consumed for purposes other than irrigation
under water rights transferred since October 8, 1945, from
an irrigation use to another use;
The largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from
such sources in any ten consecutive year period between
1952 and 1999, inclusive, has been determined by the parties
pursuant to a methodology and procedures approved and
adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to be 1,280,000
acre-feet. For the purpose of determining compliance with
this injunction, the amount of water consumed for irrigation
from such sources shall be determined by the same methodology and procedures. After ten years of administration,
accounting, and reporting under this injunction, the methodology and the ten consecutive year limit will be reviewed by
the North Platte Decree Committee pursuant to procedures
approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to
determine if there is a better methodology for calculating
the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation in such
ten consecutive year period and for determining compliance.
In making such calculation, any acreage historically reported
by the Wyoming State Engineer as irrigated by direct flow
surface water or stored water or as transfers, between 1952
and 1999, inclusive, and used in the existing methodology,
shall not be changed. In addition, the other acreage used in
the existing methodology shall not be changed unless the
North Platte Decree Committee agrees that such change results in a more accurate determination of acres actually irrigated between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. In any new methodology, to determine compliance with the consumptive use
limit, the acreage above Pathfinder Dam, when combined
with the acreage between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey
Reservoir, cannot exceed the 226,000 acreage limitation pursuant to paragraph II(c). If Nebraska, Wyoming, and the

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Appendix to Decree

United States agree on a new methodology and a new limit,
they shall notify the Court and this paragraph will be modified accordingly. As provided in paragraph XIII, absent
agreement on a new methodology and a new limit, Nebraska,
Wyoming, or the United States may seek recourse to the
Court to resolve these issues.
(b) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water
for irrigation from the North Platte River and its tributaries, including water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir for the consumption in any period of ten consecutive
years reckoned in continuing progressive series, exclusive
of the Kendrick Project, of more than the largest amount of
water consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten
consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive.
This injunction becomes effective the first full calendar year
after the entry of this Modified Decree. The consumptive
use of irrigation water in this area to be counted under this
injunction shall include the following:
(1) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with surface water diversions of natural flow;
(2) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with water stored in reservoirs that store water from
the tributaries between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey
Reservoir;
(3) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated by water from hydrologically connected groundwater
wells;
(4) Water consumed for purposes other than irrigation
with water rights transferred since October 8, 1945, from an
irrigation use to another use;
The largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from
such sources in any ten consecutive year period between
1952 and 1999, inclusive, has been determined by the parties
pursuant to a methodology and procedures approved and
adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to be 890,000

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

acre-feet. For the purpose of determining compliance with
this injunction, the amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources shall be determined by the same
methodology and procedures. After ten years of administration, accounting, and reporting under this injunction, the
methodology and the ten consecutive year limit will be reviewed by the North Platte Decree Committee pursuant to
procedures approved and adopted in the Final Settlement
Stipulation to determine if there is a better methodology for
calculating the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation in such ten consecutive year period and for determining
compliance. In making such calculation, any acreage historically reported by the Wyoming State Engineer as irrigated
by direct flow surface water or stored water or as transfers,
between 1952 and 1999, inclusive, and used in the existing
methodology, shall not be changed. In addition, the other
acreage used in the existing methodology shall not be
changed unless the North Platte Decree Committee agrees
that such change results in a more accurate determination
of acres actually irrigated between 1952 and 1999, inclusive.
In any new methodology, to determine compliance with the
consumptive use limit, the acreage above Pathfinder Dam,
when combined with the acreage between Pathfinder Dam
and Guernsey Reservoir, cannot exceed the 226,000 acreage
limitation pursuant to paragraph II(c). If Nebraska, Wyoming, and the United States agree on a new methodology
and a new limit, they shall notify the Court and this paragraph will be modified accordingly. As provided in paragraph XIII, absent agreement on a new methodology and a
new limit, Nebraska, Wyoming, or the United States may
seek recourse to the-Court to resolve these issues.
(c) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water
from the North Platte River and its tributaries, including
water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, upstream of Guernsey Reservoir for the intentional irrigation
of more than a total of 226,000 acres of land in Wyoming

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING
Appendix to Decree

during any one irrigation season, exclusive of the Kendrick
Project. The acres in this area to be counted under this
injunction shall include the following, provided that an intentionally irrigated acre that receives water from more than
one source shall be counted only once:
(1) Acres irrigated by surface water diversions of natural
flow;
(2) Acres irrigated by water stored pursuant to paragraph HI(e);
(3) Acres irrigated by water stored in reservoirs that
store water from the tributaries between Pathfinder Dam
and Guernsey Reservoir;
(4) Acres irrigated with water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells;
(5) The equivalent of the acres found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control to have been historically irrigated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water
rights where water rights on the North Platte River upstream of Guernsey Reservoir or the tributaries upstream of
Pathfinder Dam are transferred after October 8, 1945, from
an irrigation use to another use; provided, however, that the
amount of acres counted for a given year may be reduced
proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and
use of water under the transferred water right during that
year are less than the total diversion and use allowed by the
order approving such transfer;
(6) The equivalent of the acres found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control to have been historically irrigated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water
rights where water rights on the tributaries entering the
North Platte River between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey
Reservoir are transferred after January 1, 2001, from an irrigation use to another use; provided, however, that the
amount of acres counted for a given year may be reduced
proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and
use of water under the transferred water right during that

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

year are less than the total diversion and use allowed by the
order approving such transfer;
Ten years after the entry of this Modified Decree, the
provision that enjoins Wyoming from intentionally irrigating more than 226,000 acres upstream of Guernsey Reservoir will be replaced with two injunctions, one that limits
the number of acres that can be irrigated above Pathfinder
Dam and one that limits the number of acres that can be
irrigated between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir.
Wyoming has the discretion to designate the irrigated acreage limitation above Pathfinder Dam and the irrigated acreage limitation between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir, so long as the total irrigated acreage limitation does
not exceed 226,000 acres. After Wyoming makes such designation, Nebraska, Wyoming, and the United States will so
notify the Court and the Modified Decree will be modified
accordingly.
(d) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water
from the Laramie River and its tributaries, including water
from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, downstream of the Wheatland Irrigation District's Tunnel No. 2,
exclusive of the area within the Wheatland Irrigation District, for the intentional irrigation of more than a total of
39,000 acres of land in Wyomi: g during any one irrigation
season. The acres in this area to be counted under this injunction shall include the folloi fing, provided that an intentionally irrigated acre that re(eives water from more than
one source shall be counted onl once:
(1) Acres irrigated by surfac water diversions of natural
flow;
(2) Acres irrigated by stor( d irrigation water released
from a reservoir;
(3) Acres irrigated with wa ;er from hydrologically connected groundwater wells;
(4) The equivalent of the acr s found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control t) have been historically irri-

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING
Appendix to Decree

gated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water
rights where water rights are transferred after January 1,
2001, from an irrigation use that is subject to the limitations
of this paragraph II(d) to another use; provided, however,
that the amount of acres counted for a given year may be
reduced proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and use of water under the transferred water right
during that year are less than the total diversion and use
allowed by the order approving such transfer;
(e) From storing or permitting the storage of more than a
total amount of 18,000 acre-feet of water for irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and its tributaries above
Pathfinder Reservoir between October 1 of any year and
September 30 of the following year, exclusive of Seminoe
Reservoir.
III. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents,
and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined
from storing or permitting the storage of water in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe, Alcova, and Glendo Reservoirs
and the Inland Lakes otherwise than in accordance with the
relative storage rights, as among themselves, of such reservoirs, which are hereby defined and fixed as follows:
First, Pathfinder Reservoir;
Second, Inland Lakes with the same priority date as
Pathfinder Reservoir;
Third, Guernsey Reservoir;
Fourth, Seminoe Reservoir;
Fifth, Alcova Reservoir; and
Sixth, Glendo Reservoir;
Provided, however, that water accruing in priority to the
storage right of a reservoir listed above, and water accruing to the Glendo Reservoir reregulating space pursuant
to paragraph XVII(g), may be physically stored in, released
from, or exchanged with another reservoir so long as the
water is accounted in accordance with the foregoing rule of
priority and only when such storage, release, or exchange

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

will not materially interfere with the administration of water
for irrigation purposes according to the priority decreed for
the French Canal and the State Line Canals. Further, in
accordance with the opinion of this Court dated April 20,
1993 (507 U. S. 584), the United States has the right to divert
46,000 acre-feet of water during the nonirrigation season
months of October, November, and-April for storage in the
Inland Lakes. Historically, pursuant to annual agreements
entered in the discretion of the parties, such diversions
have occurred at a rate not exceeding 910 cubic feet per second from gains accruing to the river downstream of Alcova
Reservoir. This right shall be administered in accordance
with procedures to be reviewed and adopted annually by the
North Platte Decree Committee.
IV. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents,
and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined
from storing or permitting the storage of water in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe, Alcova, and Glendo Reservoirs,
and from the diversion of natural flow water through the
Casper Canal for the Kendrick Project between and including May 1 and September 30 of each year otherwise than in
accordance with the rule of priority in relation to the appropriations of the Nebraska lands supplied by the French
Canal and by the State Line Canals, which said Nebraska
appropriations are hereby adjudged to be senior to said five
reservoirs and said Casper Canal, and which said Nebraska
appropriations are hereby identified and defined, and their
diversion limitations in second feet and seasonal limitations
in acre-feet fixed as follows:

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Appendix to Decree

This paragraph limits the extent to which these canals
may stop the federal reservoirs from storing water and
the Casper Canal from diverting natural flow water. It does
not place any absolute ceilings or other restrictions on the
quantities of water that these canals may actually divert.
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S., at 603; see also Nebraska v.
Wyoming, 515 U. S., at 10.
V. The natural flow in the Guernsey Dam to Tri-State
Dam section between and including May 1 and September 30
of each year, including the contribution of Spring Creek, be
and the same hereby is apportioned between Wyoming and
Nebraska on the basis of twenty-five per cent to Wyoming
and seventy-five per cent to Nebraska, with the right
granted Nebraska to designate from time to time the portion of its share which shall be delivered into the Interstate,
Fort Laramie, French, and Mitchell Canals for use on the
Nebraska lands served by these canals. The natural flow
in a portion of certain tributaries and drains as defined in
paragraph V(a) shall also be included in the natural flow
apportioned by this paragraph. The State of Nebraska, its
officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, and the State of
Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, are
hereby enjoined and restrained from diversion or use contrary to this apportionment, provided that in the apportionment of water in this section the flow for each day, until
ascertainable, shall be assumed to be the same as that of the
preceding day, as shown by the measurements and computations for that day. Provided further that:
(a) Diversions under surface water rights for irrigation
purposes from those parts of the tributaries and drains to
the North Platte River that lie within the area bounded by
Whalen Diversion Dam on the west, the Ft. Laramie Canal
on the south, the Interstate Canal on the north, and the
Wyoming-Nebraska state line on the east, excluding the
drainage basins of the Laramie River and Horse Creek, shall
be administered and accounted as diversions of natural flow

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

for the purposes of the foregoing percentage apportionment,
unless the depletions to the North Platte River resulting
from such diversions are replaced. The amount of such
depletions, and the method for their replacement in the ordinary course of administration, shall be determined and implemented pursuant to procedures that have been approved
and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation.
(b) Diversions for irrigation purposes from wells with
water right priorities between October 8, 1945, and including
December 31, 2000, located within the area bounded by
Whalen Diversion Dam on the west, 300 feet south of the
Ft. Laramie Canal on the south, one mile north of the Interstate Canal on the north, and the Wyoming-Nebraska state
line on the east, shall be regulated as follows: To the extent
the pumping of such wells results in depletions to the North
Platte River between Whalen Diversion Dam and the state
line or to the portions of tributaries described in paragraph
V(a) between May 1 and September 30, such depletions shall
be replaced or the pumping shall be regulated to prevent
such depletions, unless such depletions occur when the natural flow in the Guernsey Dam to Tri-State Diversion Dam
reach exceeds irrigation demands in that reach. The
amount of such depletions, and the method for their replacement in the ordinary course of administration, shall be
determined and implemented pursuant to procedures that
have been approved and adopted in the Final Settlement
Stipulation.
(c) Diversions for irrigation purposes from wells with
water right priorities after December 31, 2000, located
within the area bounded by Whalen Diversion Dam on the
west, 300 feet south of the Ft. Laramie Canal on the south,
one mile north of the Interstate Canal on the north, and the
Wyoming-Nebraska state line on the east, shall be regulated
or subject to depletion replacement pursuant to procedures
that have been approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING
Appendix to Decree

(d) The river carriage and reservoir loss calculations established in the Decree of October 8, 1945, have been replaced with administrative procedures attached to the North
Platte Decree Committee Charter. These procedures may
be modified from time to time by the North Platte Decree
Committee.
VI. This Modified Decree is intended to and does deal with
and apportion only the natural flow of the North Platte
River. Storage water shall not be affected by this Modified
Decree, and the owners of rights therein shall be permitted
to distribute the same in accordance with any lawful contracts which they may have entered into or may in the future
enter into without interference because of this Modified
Decree.
VII. Such additional gauging stations and measuring devices at or near the Wyoming-Nebraska state line, if any,
as may be necessary for making any apportionment herein
decreed, shall be constructed and maintained at the joint and
equal expense of Wyoming and Nebraska to the extent that
the costs thereof are not paid by others.
VIII. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys,
agents, and employees be and they are hereby severally enjoined from diverting or permitting the diversion of water
from the North Platte River or its tributaries at or above
Alcova Reservoir in lieu of or in exchange for return flow
water from the Kendrick Project reaching the North Platte
River below Alcova Reservoir.
IX. The State of Wyoming and the State of Colorado be
and they are hereby each required to prepare and maintain
complete and accurate records of the total area of land irrigated and the storage and exportation of the water of the
North Platte River and its tributaries within those portions
of their respective jurisdictions covered by the provisions of
paragraphs I, II(c), II(d), and II(e). The State of Wyoming
is also required to prepare and maintain complete and accurate records of the total consumption of irrigation water in

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

the portion of its jurisdiction covered by paragraphs 11(a)
and II(b). The record keeping and reporting required of the
State of Wyoming by this paragraph shall be implemented
in accordance with procedures that have been approved and
adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation. The records
required by this paragraph shall be available for inspection
at all reasonable times; provided, however, that such records
shall not be required in reference to the water uses permitted by paragraphs X and XII(f).
X. This Modified Decree shall not affect or restrict the
use or diversion of water from the North Platte River and
its tributaries in Colorado or Wyoming for ordinary and
usual domestic, municipal, and stock watering purposes and
consumption.
XI. For the purposes of this Modified Decree:
(a) "Season" or "seasonal" refers to the irrigation season,
May 1 to September 30, inclusive;
(b) The term "storage water" as applied to releases from
reservoirs owned and operated by the United States is defined as any water which is released from reservoirs for
use on lands under canals having storage contracts in addition to the water which is discharged through those reservoirs to meet natural flow uses permitted by this Modified
Decree;
(c) "Natural flow water" shall be taken as referring to all
water in the stream except storage water;
(d) Return flows from the Kendrick Project shall be
deemed to be "natural flow water" when they have reached
the North Platte River, subject to the same diversion and
use as any other natural flow in the stream;
(e) "Hydrologically connected groundwater wells" are defined in procedures attached to the North Platte Decree
Committee Charter as Exhibits 4, 6, and 12 approved and
adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation. The North
Platte Decree Committee may modify such definition in accordance with the Final Settlement Stipulation.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING
Appendix to Decree

XII. This Modified Decree shall not affect:
(a) The relative rights of water users within any one of
the States who are parties to this suit except as may be
otherwise specifically provided herein;
(b) Such claims as the United States has to storage water
under Wyoming law nor will the Modified Decree in any way
interfere with the ownership and operation by the United
States of the various federal storage and power plants,
works, and facilities;
(c) The use or disposition of any additional supply or supplies of water that may be imported into the basin of the
North Platte River from the watershed of an entirely separate stream or the return flow from any such supply or
supplies;
(d) The apportionment heretofore made by this Court between the States of Wyoming and Colorado of the waters of
the Laramie River, a tributary of the North Platte River,
down to and including the Wheatland Project. The waters
of the Laramie River below the Wheatland Project are not
apportioned by this Modified Decree. The only existing
limitation in this Modified Decree on Wyoming's use of the
Laramie River is provided in paragraph II(d);
(e) The apportionment made by the compact between the
States of Nebraska and Colorado, apportioning the water of
the South Platte River;
(f) Water diverted for de minimis uses, defined as:
(1) Ponds with capacities of twenty acre-feet or less for
purposes other than irrigated agriculture;
(2) Wells with capacities less than or equal to twenty-five
gallons per minute for a single project for purposes other
than irrigated agriculture; and
(3) Miscellaneous uses that withdraw or divert less than
fifty acre-feet per year for a single project other than stock
watering, domestic or irrigated agriculture.
XIII. Any of the parties may apply at the foot of this
Modified Decree for its amendment or for further relief.

XVI. Whatever claims or defenses the parties or any of
them may have in respect to the application, interpretation,
or construction of the Act of August 9, 1937 (50 Stat. 564,
595-596), shall be determined without prejudice to any party
arising because of any development of the Kendrick Project
occurring subsequent to October 1, 1951.
XVII. The following provisions are effective for the operation of Glendo Dam and Reservoir:
(a) The operation of the Glendo Project shall not impose
any demand on areas at or above Seminoe Reservoir which
will prejudice any rights that the States of Colorado or
Wyoming might have to secure a modification of the Modified Decree permitting an expansion of water uses in the
natural basin of the North Platte River in Colorado or above
Seminoe Reservoir in Wyoming.
(b) The operation of Glendo Reservoir shall not affect the
regime of the natural flow of the North Platte River except
that not more than 40,000 acre-feet of the natural flow of
the North Platte River and its tributaries which cannot be
stored in upstream reservoirs under the provisions of this

Cite as: 534 U. S. 40 (2001)
Appendix to Decree

Modified Decree may be stored in Glendo Reservoir during
any water year for disposition by the United States under
contracts, in addition to evaporation losses on such storage,
and further, the amount of water that may be held in storage
at any one time for disposition by the United States under
contracts, including carryover storage, shall never exceed
100,000 acre-feet. Such storage water shall be disposed of
in accordance with contracts executed or to be hereafter
executed, in compliance with federal law, and may be used
for any beneficial purpose in Nebraska within the Platte
River basin to the extent of 25,000 acre-feet annually and for
any beneficial purpose in Wyoming within the Platte River
basin to the extent of 15,000 acre-feet annually. The above
limitation on the amount of storage of natural flow does not
apply: (1) to flood water which may be temporarily stored in
any capacity allocated for flood control in Glendo Reservoir;
(2) to water originally stored in Pathfinder Reservoir which
may be temporarily re-stored in Glendo Reservoir after its
release from Pathfinder and before its delivery pursuant to
contract; (3) to Inland Lakes account water temporarily
stored in accordance with this Court's Order of April 20,
1993; (4) to water which may be impounded behind Glendo
Dam, as provided in the Bureau of Reclamation Definite Plan
Report for the Glendo Unit, Wyoming, dated December 1952,
as revised through December 1959 (Glendo Definite Plan Report) for the purpose of creating a head for the development
of water power; or (5) to water in Glendo Reservoir used for
the purposes described in paragraph XVII(g).
(c) Each State may substitute or supplement quantities
of storage water obtained under other contractual arrangements with Glendo Reservoir storage supplies. Subject to
contractual arrangements with the United States Bureau
of Reclamation, including any required compliance with the
Endangered Species Act, 16 U. S. C. § 1531 et seq., and the
National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U. S. C. §4321 et seq.,
each State shall also enjoy unrestricted use of its respective

storage allocation in Glendo Reservoir, so long as the use is
below Glendo Reservoir and within the Platte River basin.
(d) Glendo Reservoir storage water may be consumptively
used in Wyoming by exchange or other means, upstream of
Glendo Reservoir under the terms of this paragraph. For
every two acre-feet of Glendo storage water diverted upstream of Glendo Reservoir pursuant to such an exchange,
all of which may be fully consumed, an additional acre-foot
of Wyoming's Glendo storage allocation shall be contracted
at the same time for storage and release from Glendo Reservoir and passed through Guernsey Reservoir to the North
Platte River. Except as may be modified in accordance with
paragraph XVII(e), or by agreement of the parties, such additional water shall be released from the reservoir at the
same time and at a rate proportionate to the diversion of the
water contracted for use upstream from Glendo Reservoir
during the irrigation season. During the nonirrigation season, due to operational constraints of the outlets at Guernsey
Reservoir, such additional water will be held in the Glendo
account and released prior to the first of May as may be
operationally practical. Except as provided in paragraph
XVII(e), once released, such additional water shall be considered natural flow water for purposes of the 75/25 apportionment specified in paragraph V.
(e) If the valid exercise or enforcement of federal law
or authority requires Wyoming or a water user within Wyoming to cause the release of a portion of Wyoming's Glendo
allocation for environmental purposes downstream of Glendo
Reservoir, the additional water contracted and released
under paragraph XVII(d) may be dedicated to and used for
that purpose. Any water released pursuant to such requirement shall not be considered natural flow but shall be administered and protected as storage water in accordance with
state law within both Wyoming and Nebraska until used for
its intended purposes.

(f) Storage water in Glendo Reservoir from either State's
allocation may be used for fish and wildlife purposes downstream of Glendo Reservoir under contractual arrangements
with the United States Bureau of Reclamation, subject to
approval of Wyoming for contracts for water from Wyoming's storage allocation and subject to approval of Nebraska for contracts for water from Nebraska's storage allocation. Any water released pursuant to such agreement
shall not be considered natural flow but shall be administered
and protected as storage water in accordance with state
law within both Wyoming and Nebraska until used for its
intended purposes.
(g) The United States Bureau of Reclamation has the
discretion to hold water in Glendo Reservoir in excess of
the limitations stated in paragraph XVII(b) in accordance
with the operation of the reregulation space in Glendo Reservoir under Permit No. 5998 Res. and Certificate of Construction of Reservoir, as clarified by Order of the Wyoming
State Board of Control dated November 29, 2000. Such
water may be used, subject to federal law, for the following
purposes:
(1) to replace water that passed the Wyoming-Nebraska
state line in excess of the amount ordered by canals with
storage contracts below the Wyoming-Nebraska state line
as the unintended result of physical limitations on the ability
to control water deliveries;
(2) to replace evaporation from the storage ownership accounts of Pathfinder Reservoir, Guernsey Reservoir, Seminoe Reservoir, Alcova Reservoir, and Glendo Reservoir; and
(3) to supplement the natural flow that is available for
apportionment pursuant to paragraph V.
