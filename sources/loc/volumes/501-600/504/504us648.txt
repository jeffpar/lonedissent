BURLINGTON NORTHERN RAILROAD CO. v. FORD
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA
No. 91-779. Argued April 20, 1992-Decided June 12, 1992
Respondents sued petitioner, their employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in the state court in Yellowstone County, Montana.
That court denied petitioner's motions to change venue to Hill County,
where petitioner claimed to have its principal place of business in Montana. The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that Montana's venue
rules-which permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that
State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit
in any county against a corporation, like petitioner, that is incorporated
elsewhere-do not work a discrimination violating the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.
Held: The distinction in treatment contained in Montana's venue rules
does not offend the Equal Protection Clause. Those rules neither deprive petitioner of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines
like race or religion, and are valid because they can be understood as
rationally furthering a legitimate state interest: adjustment of the disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial. Montana
could reasonably determine that only the convenience to a corporate
defendant of litigating in the county of its home office outweighs a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice. Petitioner has not
shown that the Montana venue rules' hinging on State of incorporation
rather than domicile makes them so underinclusive or overinclusive as
to be irrational. Besides, petitioner, being domiciled outside Montana,
would not benefit from a rule turning on domicile, and therefore cannot
complain of a rule hinging on State of incorporation. Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders,274 U. S. 490, distinguished. Pp. 650-654.
250 Mont. 188, 819 P. 2d 169, affirmed.
SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Opinion of the Court

Joel L Klein argued the cause for respondents.
on the brief was Robert S. Fain,Jr.*
JUSTICE SOUTER

With him

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Montana's venue rules permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against
a corporation incorporated elsewhere. This case presents
the question whether the distinction in treatment offends
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1. We hold that it does not.
Respondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson
were employed by petitioner Burlington Northern Railroad
Company, a corporation owing its existence to the laws of
Delaware and having a principal place of business in Fort
Worth, Texas. Ford and Johnson raised a claim under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as
amended, 45 U. S. C. §§ 51-60, and brought suit in the state
trial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises in
Sheridan, Wyoming. In each case, Burlington moved to
change venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed to
have its principal place of business in that State. The trial
court denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.
*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Washington

Legal Foundation by Daniel J Popeo and Paul D. Kamenar; and for the
Association of American Railroads by John H. Broadley, David W Ogden,
and Robert W. Blanchette.

Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were ified for the State of
Montana et al. by Marc Racicot, Attorney General of Montana, and Elizabeth S. Baker, Assistant Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General

for their respective States as follows: Tom Udall of New Mexico, Nicholas
J Spaeth of North Dakota, Mark Barnett of South Dakota, Dan Morales

of Texas, and Joseph B. Meyer of Wyoming; and for the Montana Trial
Lawyers Association by Alexander Blewett III and W William Leaphart.

BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORD
Opinion of the Court

The Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two cases
and affirmed the decisions of the trial court. 250 Mont. 188,
819 P. 2d 169 (1991). Under the Montana venue rules, the
court said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at 190, 819 P. 2d, at 171. The court
rejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rules
worked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Montana venue rules,
the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basis
review, id., at 193, 819 P. 2d, at 173, which was satisfied, at
least in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery by
injured railroad workers, id., at 194-195, 819 P. 2d, at 173174. Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did not
even discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and Johnson could have sued the corporation in the Federal District
Court for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, among
other places. Id., at 197, 819 P. 2d, at 175. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1070 (1992), and, although our reasoning
differs from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*
A Montana statute provides that "the proper place of trial
for all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or
any of them may reside at the commencement of the action."
Mont. Code Ann. § 25-2-118(1) (1991). But, "if none of the
defendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is any
county the plaintiff designates in the complaint." §25-2118(2). The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that a
corporation does not "reside in the state" for venue purposes
unless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e.g., Haug
v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P. 2d
517, 519 (1989); Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont.
469, 472-473, 499 P. 2d 774, 776 (1972); Hanlon v. Great

Northern R. Co., 83 Mont. 15, 21, 268 P. 547, 549 (1928); Pue
v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 78 Mont. 40, 43, 252 P. 313, 315
*The decision below is final for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257(a). See
American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U. S. 637, 642, n. 3 (1976).

Opinion of the Court

(1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Montana county in which it has its principal place of business,
see, e. g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont.
521, 523, 740 P. 2d 676, 677 (1987); Platt v. Sears, Roebuck &
Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P. 2d 336, 338 (1986). In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant,
permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the one
county where it has its principal place of business, while a
plaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's
56 counties. Burlington claims the distinction offends the
Equal Protection Clause.
The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to "deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1. Because the Montana
venue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamental
right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion,
they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless they
fail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends. See, e. g.,
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64 (1989); Dallas
v. Stanglin, 490 U. S. 19, 25 (1989).
Venue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place
of trial. See, e. g., Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, 44, n. 10 (1977); Denver & R. G. W R. Co.
v. Trainmen, 387 U. S. 556, 560 (1967); Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612, 623 (1964); F. James & G. Hazard, Civil
Procedure 47 (3d ed. 1985). The forum preferable to one
party may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment of
such warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. United
States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 178
(1980). In striking the balance between them, a State may
have a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard tolerating
some play in the joints of governmental machinery. See
Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson,282 U. S. 499, 501 (1931).
Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its

652

BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORD
Opinion of the Court

constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weight
to the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the
counties of their choice under all circumstances. It is
equally clear that a State might temper such an "any county"
rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants'
interests so justified.
Here, Montana has decided that the any-county rule should
give way to a single-county rule where a defendant resides
in Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff's tactical advantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.
At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of a
defendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whether
they have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See Power
Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, 498 (1927)
(Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decided
that a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is too
slight to outweigh the plaintiff's interest in suing in the
forum of his choice.
Burlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that such
a decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individual
nonresident defendants. Nor does it argue that such a rule
is unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana. Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional as
applied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that not
only has its home office in some other State or country, but
also has a place of business in Montana that would qualify
as its "principal place of business" if it were a Montana
corporation.
Burlington's claim fails. Montana could reasonably have
determined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's convenience
in litigation than its other offices, that foreign corporations

Cite as: 504 U. S. 648 (1992)
Opinion of the Court

are unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana, and
that Montana's domestic corporations will probably keep
headquarters within the State. We cannot say, at least not
on this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.
Cf. G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 410 (1982); Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 585
(1935). And upon them Montana may have premised the
policy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeachable, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of
litigating in the county containing its home office is sufficiently significant to outweigh a plaintiff's interest in suing
in the county of his choice.
Of course Montana's venue rules would have implemented
that policy judgment with greater precision if they had
turned on the location of a corporate defendant's principal
place of business, not on its State of incorporation. But this
is hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review,
for "rational distinctions may be made with substantially less
than mathematical exactitude." New Orleans v. Dukes, 427
U. S. 297, 303 (1976); see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.,
426 U. S. 794, 814 (1976); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas
Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78 (1911). Montana may reasonably have
thought that the location of a corporate defendant's principal
place of business would not be as readily verifiable as its
State of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the former
would invite wasteful sideshows of venue litigation, and that
obviating the sideshows would be worth the loss in precision.
These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry away
from the point of discharging its burden of showing that the
underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness of Montana's venue
rules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment. See, e. g.,
Brownell, supra, at 584. Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a scheme
based on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complain
of Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for

BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORD
Opinion of the Court

domicile. See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271
U. S. 50, 53-55 (1926); cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.
17, 21 (1960).
Burlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case. But
it does not. In Saunders, we considered Arkansas' venue
rules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation to
those counties where it maintained a place of business, 274
U. S., at 491-492, but exposed foreign corporations to suit in
any county, id., at 492. We held that the distinction lacked
a rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporate
defendants of the equal protection of the laws. Id., at 494.
The statutory provision challenged in Saunders, however,
applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations subject to its any-county rule probably had a place of business
in Arkansas. In contrast, most of the corporations subject
to Montana's any-county rule probably do not have their
principal place of business in Montana. Thus, Arkansas'
special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assumption that Saunders is still good law, see American Motorists
Ins. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U. S. 637, 645, n. 6 (1976), its holding
does not invalidate Montana's venue rules.
In sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly
Affirmed.
