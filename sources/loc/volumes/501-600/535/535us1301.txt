OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

BARTLETT

ET AL. V.

STEPHENSON

ET AL.

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. 01A848.

Decided May 17, 2002

The application of North Carolina officials to stay a State Supreme Court
decision invalidating the 2001 state legislative redistricting plan under
the State Constitution is denied. That court held that the plan violated
a state constitutional provision that does not allow a county to be divided when forming a senate or representative district. Harmonizing
that provision with federal law, the court found that any new plan must
preserve county lines except to the extent counties must be divided to
comply with the United States Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.
Applicants, who claim that a 1981 Department of Justice (DOJ) letter
bars any consideration of the whole county provision in redistricting, do
not satisfy the threshold requirement for the issuance of a stay. It is
unlikely that four Members of this Court will vote to grant certiorari to
resolve a dispute about the meaning of a single DOJ letter. This issue
does not satisfy any of the criteria for the exercise of the Court's discretionary jurisdiction. And this case does not present the same situation
as Lopez v. Monterey County, 519 U. S.9, 19, 21, and Clark v. Roemer,
500 U. S.646, 654-655, in which this Court issued stays enjoining a covered jurisdiction from conducting imminent elections under an unprecleared voting plan.

Circuit Justice.
Applicants, North Carolina officials charged with administering the State's elections, seek a stay of a decision of the
Supreme Court of North Carolina invalidating North Carolina's 2001 state legislative redistricting plan under the North
Carolina Constitution. The application is denied.
The Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the 2001
plan violated what is known as the "whole county provision"
of the North Carolina Constitution, which provides that "no

county shall be divided in the formation of a senate or representative district," N. C. Const., Art. II, ยง3(3). See 355
N. C. 354, 363, 562 S. E. 2d 377, 384 (2002). The court thus
affirmed a lower court injunction enjoining applicants from
conducting any elections under the 2001 plan and ordered
that a new plan be drawn. Id., at 359-360, 386, 562 S. E.
2d, at 382, 398. The court directed the state trial court to
conduct a hearing on whether it is feasible for the state legislature to develop a new plan for the 2002 elections. If it is
not, then the trial court is directed to solicit plans and adopt
one. Id., at 385, 562 S.E. 2d, at 398.
The Supreme Court of North Carolina recognized, however, that requirements of federal law will preclude the new
plan from giving full effect to the "whole county provision."
Id., at 371, 381, 562 S.E. 2d, at 389, 396. The court therefore
"harmonized" the state constitutional provision with federal
law, ordering that the new plan "must preserve county lines
to the maximum extent possible, except to the extent counties must be divided to comply with Section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act [of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C.
ยง 1973c (1994 ed.)], and to comply with Section 2 of the Voting
Rights Act, and to comply with the U. S. Constitution, including the federal one-person one-vote requirements." Id., at
359, 562 S.E. 2d, at 382. The court cited decisions in four
other States that have reconciled similar county boundary
requirements with federal law. Id., at 372, n. 3, 562 S. E.
2d, at 390, n. 3 (citing In re Apportionment of Colo. Gen. Assembly, 45 P. 3d 1237 (Colo. 2002); Hellar v. Cenarrusa,106
Idaho 571, 574-575, 682 P. 2d 524, 527-528 (1984); Fischer
v. State Bd. of Elections,879 S.W. 2d 475,479 (Ky. 1994); State
ex rel. Lockert v. Crowel, 631 S.W. 2d 702, 714-715 (Tenn.
1982)). And the Supreme Court of North Carolina ordered
that the trial court shall seek preclearance of the new plan,
with respect to the districts in the 40 North Carolina counties that are covered jurisdictions under ยง 5 of the Voting

Rights Act, before elections are held. 355 N. C., at 385, 562
S. E. 2d, at 398.
Applicants contend that a stay is warranted because the
Supreme Court of North Carolina's decision "defies the Voting Rights Act" and directs applicants "to violate the Voting
Rights Act and to administer or enforce unprecleared state
constitutional provisions." Application 13, 20. In support
of these assertions, applicants rely on a 1981 Department
of Justice (DOJ) letter that objected to the "whole county
provision." In 1981, North Carolina submitted both its 1981
redistricting plan, which was faithful to the "whole county
provision," and the "whole county provision" itself to the
DOJ. The DOJ objected to both, stating that it was "unable
to conclude that this amendment, prohibiting the division of
counties in reapportionments, does not have a discriminatory
purpose or effect." App. 2 to Application 1. The letter also
stated that "until the objection is withdrawn or [a] judgment
from the [United States District Court for the] District of
Columbia is obtained, the effect of the objection by the
Attorney General is to make the [whole county provision]
legally unenforceable." Id., at 2.
The Supreme Court of North Carolina rejected applicants'
view that this letter bars any consideration of the whole
county provision in redistricting. In its view, other statements in the letter demonstrate that the letter "merely disallows a redistricting plan that adheres strictly to a 'whole
county' criterion without complying with the [Voting Rights
Act]." 355 N. C., at 374, 562 S.E. 2d, at 391. The court
quoted the following statement from the DOJ letter: "'This
determination with respect to the jurisdictions covered by
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act should in no way be regarded as precluding the State from following a policy of
preserving county lines whenever feasible in formulating
its new districts. Indeed, this is the policy in many states,
subject only to the preclearance requirements of Section 5,

where applicable."' Id., at 372-373, 562 S. E. 2d, at 390.
The court thought this interpretation of the letter consistent
with DOJ administrative guidance that provides "'criteria
which require the jurisdiction to ...follow county, city, or
precinct boundaries... may need to give way to some degree
to avoid retrogression."' Id., at 373, 562 S. E. 2d, at 391
(quoting 66 Fed. Reg. 5413 (2001)) (emphasis added).
A "single Justice will grant a stay only in extraordinary
circumstances." Whalen v. Roe, 423 U. S. 1313, 1316 (Marshall, J., in chambers). Applicants do not satisfy the threshold requirement for the issuance of a stay. There is not a
reasonable probability that four Members of this Court will
vote to grant certiorari to resolve what is largely a dispute
about the meaning of a single DOJ letter from 1981. See
Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (KENNEDY, J.,
in chambers). This issue, which has few if any ramifications
beyond the instant case, does not satisfy any of the criteria
for the exercise of this Court's discretionary jurisdiction.
See this Court's Rule 10.
Applicants cite two cases in which the Court issued stays
enjoining a covered jurisdiction from conducting imminent
elections "under an unprecleared voting plan." Lopez v.
Monterey County, 519 U. S. 9, 19, 21 (1996); Clark v. Roemer,
500 U. S. 646, 654-655 (1991). This case does not present
the same situation. The Supreme Court of North Carolina
ordered that the new plan would have to be precleared before elections could be held in the 40 covered counties. On
remand, the trial court has already made clear its understanding of this requirement, issuing an order stating that
"[n]o plan submitted by the General Assembly and approved
by this Court, or in the absence of such a plan, no plan
adopted by the Court, shall be administered in the 2002 elections until such time as it is precleared pursuant to Section
5 of the Voting Rights Act." App. 13 to Response in Opposition 3. As there is no plan in North Carolina to hold elec-

tions in unprecleared districts, there are no grounds for
granting a stay. The stay application is denied.
It is so ordered.
