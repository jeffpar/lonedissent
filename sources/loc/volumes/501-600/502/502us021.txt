HAFER v. MELO ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 90-681. Argued October 15, 1991-Decided November 5, 1991
After petitioner Hafer, the newly elected auditor general of Pennsylvania,
discharged respondents from their jobs in her office, they sued her for,
inter alia, monetary damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The District
Court dismissed the latter claims under Will v. Michigan Dept. of State
Police,491 U. S. 58, 71, in which the Court held that state officials "acting in their official capacities" are outside the class of "persons" subject
to liability under § 1983. In reversing this ruling, the Court of Appeals
found that respondents sought damages from Hafer in her personal capacity and held that, because she acted under color of state law, respondents could maintain a § 1983 individual-capacity suit against her.
Held: State officers may be held personally liable for damages under
§ 1983 based upon actions taken in their official capacities. Pp. 25-31.
(a) The above-quoted language from Will does not establish that
Hafer may not be held personally liable under § 1983 because she
"act[ed]" in her official capacity. The claims considered in Will were
official-capacity claims, and the phrase "acting in their official capacities"
is best understood as a reference to the capacity in which the state
officer is sued, not the capacity in which the officer inflicts the alleged
injury. Pp. 25-27.
(b) State officials, sued in their individual capacities, are "persons"
within the meaning of § 1983. Unlike official-capacity defendants--who
are not "persons" because they assume the identity of the government
that employs them, Will, supra, at 71-officers sued in their personal
capacity come to the court as individuals and thus fit comfortably within
the statutory term "person," cf. 491 U. S., at 71, n. 10. Moreover,
§ 1983's authorization of suits to redress deprivations of civil rights by
persons acting "under color of" state law means that Hafer may be liable
for discharging respondents precisely because of her authority as auditor general. Her assertion that acts that are both within the official's
authority and necessary to the performance of governmental functions
(including the employment decisions at issue) should be considered acts
of the State that cannot give rise to a personal-capacity action is unpersuasive. That contention ignores this Court's holding that § 1983 was
enacted to enforce provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment against
those who carry a badge of a State and represent it in some capacity,

HAFER v. MELO
Opinion of the Court
whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it.
Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 243. Furthermore, Hafer's theory
would absolutely immunize state officials from personal liability under
§ 1983 solely by virtue of the "official" nature of their acts, in contravention of this Court's immunity decisions. See, e. g., Scheuer, supra.
Pp. 27-29.
(c) The Eleventh Amendment does not bar § 1983 personal-capacity
suits against state officials in federal court. Id., at 237, 238. Will's
language concerning suits against state officials cannot be read as establishing the limits of liability under the Amendment, since Will arose
from a suit in state court and considered the Amendment only because
the fact that Congress did not intend to override state immunity when
it enacted § 1983 was relevant to statutory construction. 491 U. S., at
66. Although imposing personal liability on state officers may hamper
their performance of public duties, such concerns are properly addressed
within the framework of this Court's personal immunity jurisprudence.
Pp. 29-31.

Opinion of the Court

under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983. 491 U. S., at 71.
Petitioner takes this language to mean that § 1983 does not
authorize suits against state officers for damages arising
from official acts. We reject this reading of Will and hold
that state officials sued in their individual capacities are
"persons" for purposes of § 1983.
I
In 1988, petitioner Barbara Hafer sought election to the
post of auditor general of Pennsylvania. Respondents allege that during the campaign United States Attorney James
West gave Hafer a list of 21 employees in the auditor general's office who secured their jobs through payments to a former employee of the office. App. 10. They further allege
that Hafer publicly promised to fire all employees on the list
if elected. Ibid.
Hafer won the election. Shortly after becoming auditor
general, she dismissed 18 employees, including named respondent James Melo, Jr., on the basis that they "bought"
their jobs. Melo and seven other terminated employees
sued Hafer and West in Federal District Court. They asserted state and federal claims, including a claim under
§ 1983, and sought monetary damages. Carl Gurley and the
remaining respondents in this case also lost their jobs with
the auditor general soon after Hafer took office. These respondents allege that Hafer discharged them because of their
Democratic political affiliation and support for her opponent
in the 1988 election. Id., at 28, 35, 40. They too filed suit
against Hafer, seeking monetary damages and reinstatement
under § 1983.
After consolidating the Melo and Gurley actions, the District Court dismissed all claims. In relevant part, the court
held that the § 1983 claims against Hafer were barred because, under Will, she could not be held liable for employment decisions made in her official capacity as auditor
general.

HAFER v. MELO
Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed this
portion of the District Court's decision. 912 F. 2d 628 (1990).
As to claims for reinstatement brought against Hafer in her
official capacity, the court rested on our statement in Will
that state officials sued for injunctive relief in their official
capacities are "persons" subject to liability under § 1983.
See Will, supra,at 71, n. 10. Turning to respondents' monetary claims, the court found that six members of the Gurley
group had expressly sought damages from Hafer in her personal capacity. The remaining plaintiffs "although not as
explicit, signified a similar intent." 912 F. 2d, at 636.* The
court found this critical. While Hafer's power to hire and
fire derived from her position as auditor general, it said, a
suit for damages based on the exercise of this authority could
be brought against Hafer in her personal capacity. Because
Hafer acted under color of state law, respondents could maintain a § 1983 individual-capacity suit against her.
We granted certiorari, 498 U. S...1118 (1991), to address the
question whether state officers may be held personally liable
for damages under § 1983 based upon actions taken in their
official capacities.
*The Third Circuit looked to the proceedings below to determine
whether certain respondents brought their claims for damages against
Hafer in her official capacity or her personal capacity. 912 F. 2d, at 635636. Several other Courts of Appeals adhere to this practice. See Conner v. Reinhard, 847 F. 2d 384, 394, n. 8 (CA7), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 856
(1988); Houston v. Reich, 932 F. 2d 883, 885 (CA10 1991); Lundgren v.
McDaniel, 814 F. 2d 600, 603-604 (CAll 1987). Still others impose a
more rigid pleading requirement. See Wells v. Brown, 891 F. 2d 591, 592
(CA6 1989) (§ 1983 plaintiff must specifically plead that suit for damages
is brought against state official in individual capacity); Nix v. Norman,
879 F. 2d 429, 431 (CA8 1989) (same). Because this issue is not properly
before us, we simply reiterate the Third Circuit's view that "[i]t is obviously preferable for the plaintiff to be specific in the first instance to avoid
any ambiguity." 912 F. 2d, at 636, n. 7. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a)
("Only the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,
will be considered by the Court").

Opinion of the Court

II
In Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159 (1985), the Court
sought to eliminate lingering confusion about the distinction
between personal- and official-capacity suits. We emphasized that official-capacity suits "'generally represent only
another way of pleading an action against an entity of which
an officer is an agent."' Id., at 165 (quoting Monell v. New
York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, 690, n. 55
(1978)). Suits against state officials in their official capacity
therefore should be treated as suits against the State. 473
U. S., at 166. Indeed, when officials sued in this capacity in
federal court die or leave office, their successors automatically assume their roles in the litigation. See Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 25(d)(1); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 43(c)(1); this Court's Rule
35.3. Because the real party in interest in an officialcapacity suit is the governmental entity and not the named
official, "the entity's 'policy or custom' must have played a
part in the violation of federal law." Graham,supra, at 166
(quoting Monell, supra, at 694). For the same reason, the
only immunities available to the defendant in an officialcapacity action are those that the governmental entity possesses. 473 U. S., at 167.
Personal-capacity suits, on the other hand, seek to impose
individual liability upon a government officer for actions
taken under color of state law. Thus, "[o]n the merits, to
establish personal liability in a § 1983 action, it is enough to
show that the official, acting under color of state law, caused
the deprivation of a federal right." Id., at 166. While the
plaintiff in a personal-capacity suit need not establish a connection to governmental "policy or custom," officials sued in
their personal capacities, unlike those sued in their official
capacities, may assert personal immunity defenses such as
objectively reasonable reliance on existing law. Id., at
166-167.
Our decision in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491
U. S. 58 (1989), turned in part on these differences between

HAFER v. MELO
Opinion of the Court

personal- and official-capacity actions. The principal issue
in Will was whether States are "persons" subject to suit
under § 1983. Section 1983 provides, in relevant part:
"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State...
subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the
United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall
be liable to the party injured .... "
The Court held that interpreting the words "[e]very person"
to exclude the States accorded with the most natural reading
of the law, with its legislative history, and with the rule that
Congress must clearly state its intention to alter "'the federal balance"' when it seeks to do so. Will, supra, at 65
(quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S.336, 349 (1971)).
The Court then addressed the related question whether
state officials, sued for monetary relief in their official capacities, are persons under § 1983. We held that they are not.
Although "state officials literally are persons," an officialcapacity suit against a state officer "is not a suit against the
official but rather is a suit against the official's office. As
such it is no different from a suit against the State itself."
491 U. S., at 71 (citation omitted).
Summarizing our holding, we said: "[N]either a State nor
its officials acting in their official capacities are 'persons'
under § 1983." Ibid. Hafer relies on this recapitulation for
the proposition that she may not be held personally liable
under § 1983 for discharging respondents because she
"act[ed]" in her official capacity as auditor general of Pennsylvania. Of course, the claims considered in Will were
official-capacity claims; the phrase "acting in their official capacities" is best understood as a reference to the capacity in
which the state officer is sued, not the capacity in which the
officer inflicts the alleged injury. To the extent that Will

Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)

Opinion of the Court

allows the construction Hafer suggests, however, we now
eliminate that ambiguity.
A
Will itself makes clear that the distinction between officialcapacity suits and personal-capacity suits is more than "a
mere pleading device." Ibid. State officers sued for damages in their official capacity are not "persons" for purposes
of the suit because they assume the identity of the government that employs them. Ibid. By contrast, officers sued
in their personal capacity come to court as individuals. A
government official in the role of personal-capacity defendant
thus fits comfortably within the statutory term "person."
Cf. id., at 71, n. 10 ("[A] state official in his or her official
capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person
under § 1983 because 'official-capacity actions for prospective
relief are not treated as actions against the State' ") (quoting
Graham,473 U. S., at 167, n. 14).
Hafer seeks to overcome the distinction between officialand personal-capacity suits by arguing that § 1983 liability
turns not on the capacity in which state officials are sued,
but on the capacity in which they acted when injuring the
plaintiff. Under Will, she asserts, state officials may not be
held liable in their personal capacity for actions they take in
their official capacity. Although one Court of Appeals has
endorsed this view, see Cowan v. University of Louisville
School of Medicine, 900 F. 2d 936, 942-943 (CA6 1990), we
find it both unpersuasive as an interpretation of § 1983 and
foreclosed by our prior decisions.
Through § 1983, Congress sought "to give a remedy to parties deprived of constitutional rights, privileges and immunities by an official's abuse of his position." Monroe v. Pape,
365 U. S. 167, 172 (1961). Accordingly, it authorized suits to
redress deprivations of civil rights by persons acting "under
color of any [state] statute, ordinance, regulation, custom,
or usage." 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The requirement of action
under color of state law means that Hafer may be liable for

HAFER v. MELO

Opinion of the Court

discharging respondents precisely because of her authority
as auditor general. We cannot accept the novel proposition
that this same official authority insulates Hafer from suit.
In an effort to limit the scope of her argument, Hafer distinguishes between two categories of acts taken under color
of state law: those outside the official's authority or not essential to the operation of state government, and those both
within the official's authority and necessary to the performance of governmental functions. Only the former group, she
asserts, can subject state officials to personal liability under
§ 1983; the latter group (including the employment decisions
at issue in this case) should be considered acts of the State
that cannot give rise to a personal-capacity action.
The distinction Hafer urges finds no support in the broad
language of § 1983. To the contrary, it ignores our holding
that Congress enacted § 1983 "'to enforce provisions of the
Fourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge of
authority of a State and represent it in some capacity,
whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it."' Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 243 (1974) (quoting Monroe v. Pape, supra, at 171-172). Because of that
intent, we have held that in § 1983 actions the statutory requirement of action "under color of" state law is just as
broad as the Fourteenth Amendment's "state action" requirement. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922,
929 (1982).
Furthermore, Hafer's distinction cannot be reconciled with
our decisions regarding immunity of government officers otherwise personally liable for acts done in the course of their
official duties. Her theory would absolutely immunize state
officials from personal liability for acts within their authority
and necessary to fulfilling governmental responsibilities.
Yet our cases do not extend absolute immunity to all officers
who engage in necessary official acts. Rather, immunity
from suit under § 1983 is "predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant

Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)
Opinion of the Court

official at common law and the interests behind it," Imbler
v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.409, 421 (1976), and officials seeking
absolute immunity must show that such immunity is justified
for the governmental function at issue, Burns v. Reed, 500
U. S. 478, 486-487 (1991).
This Court has refused to extend absolute immunity beyond a very limited class of officials, including the President
of the United States, legislators carrying out their legislative
functions, and judges carrying out their judicial functions,
"whose special functions or constitutional status requires
complete protection from suit." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S.800, 807 (1982). State executive officials are not entitled to absolute immunity for their official actions. Scheuer
v. Rhodes, supra. In several instances, moreover, we have
concluded that no more than a qualified immunity attaches
to administrative employment decisions, even if the same official has absolute immunity when performing other functions. See Forresterv. White, 484 U. S.219 (1988) (dismissal
of court employee by state judge); Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
supra (discharge of Air Force employee, allegedly orchestrated by senior White House aides) (action under Bivens v.
Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.388 (1971));
Davis v. Passman,442 U. S.228 (1979) (dismissal of congressional aide) (Bivens action). That Hafer may assert personal immunity within the framework of these cases in no
way supports her argument here.
B
Hafer further asks us to read Will's language concerning
suits against state officials as establishing the limits of liability under the Eleventh Amendment. She asserts that imposing personal liability on officeholders may infringe on
state sovereignty by rendering government less effective;
thus, she argues, the Eleventh Amendment forbids personalcapacity suits against state officials in federal court.

HAFER v. MELO
Opinion of the Court

Most certainly, Will's holding does not rest directly on the
Eleventh Amendment. Whereas the Eleventh Amendment
bars suits in federal court "by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the
state treasury," Edelman v. Jordan,415 U. S. 651, 663 (1974),
Will arose from a suit in state court. We considered the
Eleventh Amendment in Will only because the fact that Congress did not intend to override state immunity when it enacted § 1983 was relevant to statutory construction: "Given
that a principal purpose behind the enactment of § 1983 was
to provide a federal forum for civil rights claims," Congress'
failure to authorize suits against States in federal courts suggested that it also did not intend to authorize such claims in
state courts. 491 U. S., at 66.
To the extent that Hafer argues from the Eleventh
Amendment itself, she makes a claim that failed in Scheuer
v. Rhodes, supra. In Scheuer, personal representatives of
the estates of three students who died at Kent State University in May 1970 sought damages from the Governor of Ohio
and other state officials. The District Court dismissed their
complaints on the theory that the suits, although brought
against state officials in their personal capacities, were in
substance actions against the State of Ohio and therefore
barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
We rejected this view. "[S]ince Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.
123 (1908)," we said, "it has been settled that the Eleventh
Amendment provides no shield for a state official confronted
by a claim that he had deprived another of a federal right
under the color of state law." Scheuer, supra, at 237.
While the doctrine of Ex parte Young does not apply where
a plaintiff seeks damages from the public treasury, damages
awards against individual defendants in federal courts "are
a permissible remedy in some circumstances notwithstanding the fact that they hold public office." 416 U. S., at 238.
That is, the Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier

Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)

Opinion of the Court

against suits to impose "individual and personal liability" on
state officials under § 1983. Ibid.
To be sure, imposing personal liability on state officers
may hamper their performance of public duties. But such
concerns are properly addressed within the framework of
our personal immunity jurisprudence. See Forrester v.
White, supra, at 223. Insofar as respondents seek damages
against Hafer personally, the Eleventh Amendment does not
restrict their ability to sue in federal court.
We hold that state officials, sued in their individual capacities, are "persons" within the meaning of § 1983. The Eleventh Amendment does not bar such suits, nor are state officers absolutely immune from personal liability under § 1983
solely by virtue of the "official" nature of their acts.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or

decision of this case.
