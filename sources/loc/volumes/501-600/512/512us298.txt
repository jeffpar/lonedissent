BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD
OF CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,
THIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT
No. 92-1384. Argued March 28, 1994-Decided June 20, 1994*
During the years at issue in these consolidated cases, California used a
"worldwide combined reporting" method to determine the corporate
franchise tax owed by unitary multinational corporate group members
doing business in California. California's method first looked to the
worldwide income of the unitary business, and then taxed a percentage
of that income equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide
payroll, property, and sales located within California. In contrast, the
Federal Government employs a "separate accounting" method, which
treats each corporate entity discretely for the purpose of determining
income tax liability. In Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax
Bd., 463 U. S. 159, this Court upheld the California scheme as applied to
domestic-based multinationals, but did not address the constitutionality
of the scheme as applied to domestic corporations with foreign parents
or to foreign corporations with foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries.
Both petitioner Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays)-a foreign multinational-and petitioner Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate)-a domestic multinational-have operations in California. In separate cases, two members of the Barclays group and Colgate were denied refunds by the
California authorities.
Held: The Constitution does not impede application of California's tax to
Barclays and Colgate. Pp. 310-331.
(a) Absent congressional approval, a state tax on interstate or foreign
commerce will not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if the taxpayer
demonstrates that the tax (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial
nexus to the taxing State; (2) is not fairly apportioned; (3) discriminates
against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly related to the services
the State provides. Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S.
274, 279. A tax affecting foreign commerce raises two additional concerns: one prompted by the "enhanced risk of multiple taxation," Container Corp., 463 U.S., at 185, and the other related to the Federal Government's capacity to "'speak with one voice when regulating

commercial relations with foreign governments,"' Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 449. California's tax easily meets
all but the third of the Complete Auto criteria. As to the third,
Barclays has not shown that the system in fact operates to impose
inordinate compliance burdens on foreign enterprises, and its claim of
unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce thus fails.
Pp. 310-314.
(b) Nor has Barclays shown that California's "reasonable approximations" method of reducing the compliance burden is incompatible with
due process. Barclays argues that California employs no standard to
determine what approximations will be accepted, but Barclays has presented no example of an approximation California rejected as unreasonable. Furthermore, the state judiciary has construed California law to
curtail the discretion of state tax officials, and the State has afforded
Barclays the opportunity to seek clarification of the meaning of the relevant regulations. Rules governing international multijurisdictional income allocation have an inescapable imprecision given the subject matter's complexity, and rules against vagueness are not mechanically
applied; rather, their application is tied to the nature of the enactment.
Pp. 314-316.
(c)California's system does not expose foreign multinationals, such
as Barclays, to constitutionally intolerable multiple taxation. In the
face of a similar challenge, Container Corp.approved this very tax when
applied to a domestic-based multinational. The considerations that informed the Container Corp. decision are not dispositively diminished
when the tax is applied to a foreign-based enterprise. Multiple taxation is not the inevitable result of California's tax, and the alternative
reasonably available to the State--separate accounting--cannot eliminate, and in some cases may even enhance, the risk of double taxation.
Pp. 316-320.
(d) California's scheme also does not prevent the Federal Government
from speaking with "one voice" in international trade. Congress holds
the control rein in this area. In the 11 years since Container Corp.,
Congress has not barred States from using the worldwide combined
reporting method. In the past three decades, aware that foreign governments deplored use of the method, Congress nevertheless failed to
enact any of numerous bills, or to ratify a treaty provision, that would
have prohibited the practice. Executive Branch actions, statements,
and amicus filings do not supply the requisite federal directive proscribing States' use of worldwide combined reporting, for the regulatory authority is Congress' to wield. Executive Branch communications that
express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot render unconstitu-

multinational enterprise, against a comprehensive challenge
made under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the
Federal Constitution. Container Corp. involved a corporate
taxpayer domiciled and headquartered in the United States;
in addition to its stateside components, the taxpayer had a
number of overseas subsidiaries incorporated in the countries in which they operated. The Court's decision in Container Corp. did not address the constitutionality of California's taxing scheme as applied to "domestic corporations with
foreign parents or [to] foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries." Id:, at 189, n. 26. In
the consolidated cases before us, we return to the taxing
scheme earlier considered in Container Corp. and resolve
matters left open in that case.
The petitioner in No. 92-1384, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), is a United Kingdom corporation in the Barclays
Group, a multinational banking enterprise. The petitioner
in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate), is the
United States-based parent of a multinational manufacturing
and sales enterprise. Each enterprise has operations in
California. During the years here at issue, California determined the state corporate franchise tax due for these operations under a method known as "worldwide combined reporting." California's scheme first looked to the worldwide
income of the multinational enterprise, and then attributed
a portion of that income (equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located in California) to the California operations. The State imposed its
tax on the income thus attributed to Barclays' and Colgate's
California business.
Barclays urges that California's tax system distinctively
burdens foreign-based multinationals and results in double
international taxation, in violation of the Commerce and Due
Process Clauses. Both Barclays and Colgate contend that
the scheme offends the Commerce Clause by frustrating the
Federal Government's ability to "speak with one voice when

Opinion of the Court

regulating commercial relations with foreign governments."
JapanLine, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 449
(1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). We reject these
arguments, and hold that the Constitution does not impede
application of California's corporate franchise tax to Barclays
and Colgate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the
California Court of Appeal.
I
A
The Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution, this Court has held, prevent States that impose an
income-based tax on nonresidents from "tax[ing] value
earned outside [the taxing State's] borders." ASARCO Inc.
v. Idaho Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307, 315 (1982). But when
a business enterprise operates in more than one taxing jurisdiction, arriving at "precise territorial allocations of 'value'
is often an elusive goal, both in theory and in practice." Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 164. Every method of allocation
devised involves some degree of arbitrariness. See id., at
182.
One means of deriving locally taxable income, generally
used by States that collect corporate income-based taxes, is
the "unitary business" method. As explained in Container
Corp., unitary taxation "rejects geographical or transactional accounting," which is "subject to manipulation" and
does not fully capture "the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the components of a single enterprise." Id., at 164-165. The "unitary
business/formula apportionment" method
"calculates the local tax base by first defining the scope
of the 'unitary business' of which the taxed enterprise's
activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and
then apportioning the total income of that 'unitary business' between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the
world on the basis of a formula taking into account ob-

304 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD.OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

jective measures of the corporation's activities within
and without the jurisdiction." Id., at 165.1
During the income years at issue in these cases-1977 for
Barclays, 1970-1973 for Colgate-California assessed its corporate franchise tax by employing a "worldwide combined
reporting" method. California's scheme required the taxpayer to aggregate the income of all corporate entities composing the unitary business enterprise, including in the
aggregation both affiliates operating abroad and those
operating within the United States. Having defined the
scope of the "unitary business" thus broadly, California used
a long-accepted method of apportionment, commonly called
the "three-factor" formula, to arrive at the amount of income
attributable to the operations of the enterprise in California.
Under the three-factor formula, California taxed a percentage of worldwide income equal to the arithmetic average of
the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located inside the State. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §25128
1This

Court first considered the "unitary business principle" in 1897,
Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S.194, 220-221; we revisited this "settled jurisprudence" most recently in Allied-Signal, Inc. v.
Director,Div. of Taxation, 504 U. S.768, 779-788 (1992). See generally
1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein, State Taxation: Corporate Income and
Franchise Taxes 8.03, p. 8-29 (2d ed. 1993); id., 8.05. On the determination whether a business is "unitary," see Allied-Signal, 504 U. S., at
781-782 (business may be treated as unitary, compatibly with constitutional limitations, if it exhibits functional integration, centralization of
management, and economies of scale); Edison California Stores, Inc. v.
McColgan, 30 Cal. 2d 472, 481, 183 P. 2d 16, 21 (1947) ("If the operation of
the portion of the business done within the state is dependent upon or
contributes to the operation of the business without the state, the operations are unitary."); Butler Brothers v. McColgan, 17 Cal. 2d 664, 678, 111

P. 2d 884, 841 (1941) (Abusiness is unitary if there is "(1) [u]nity of ownership; (2) [u]nity of operation as evidenced by central purchasing, advertising, accounting and management divisions; and (3) unity of use of its centralized executive force and general system of operation."), aff'd, 315 U. S.
501 (1942).

Opinion of the Court

(West 1992). Thus, if a unitary business had 8% of its payroll, 3% of its property, and 4% of its sales in California, the
State took the average-5%--and imposed its tax on that
percentage of the business' total income.2
B
The corporate income tax imposed by the United States
employs a "separate accounting" method, a means of apportioning income among taxing sovereigns used by all major
developed nations. In contrast to combined reporting, separate accounting treats each corporate entity discretely for
the purpose of determining income tax liability.3
Separate accounting poses the risk that a conglomerate
will manipulate transfers of value among its components to
minimize its total tax liability. To guard against such manipulation, transactions between affiliated corporations must
be scrutinized to ensure that they are reported on an "arm'slength" basis, i. e., at a price reflecting their true market
value. See 26 U. S. C. §482; Treas. Reg. § 1.482-IT(b), 26
CFR § 1.482-IT(b) (1993). 4 Assuming that all transactions
are assigned their arm's-length values in the corporate accounts, a jurisdiction using separate accounting taxes corporations that operate within its borders only on the income
2In 1993, California modified the formula to double the weight of the
sales factor. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §25128 (West Supp. 1994); 1993
Cal. Stats., ch. 946, § 1.
8
An affiliated group of domestic corporations may, however, elect to file
a consolidated federal tax return in lieu of separate returns. 26 U. S. C.
§ 1501.
4Effective enforcement of arm's-length standards requires exacting
scrutiny by the taxing jurisdiction, and some commentators maintain that
the results are arbitrary in any event. See 1 Hellerstein & Hellerstein,
supra, 8.03 (describing "three inherent defects" of separate accounting:
compliance expense, impracticability, and the difficulty of arriving at
"arm's-length" prices).

306 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

those corporations recognize on their own books. See Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 185. 5
At one time, a number of States used worldwide combined
reporting, as California did during the years at issue. In
recent years, such States, including California, have modified
their systems at least to allow corporate election of some
variant of an approach that confines combined reporting to
the United States' "water's edge." See 1 Hellerstein & Hellerstein, supra n. 1, 8.16, at 8-185 to 8-187. California's
1986 modification of its corporate franchise tax, effective in
1988, 1986 Cal. Stats., ch. 660, §6, made it nearly the last
State to give way. 1 Hellerstein & Hellerstein, supra n. 1,
8.16, at 8-187.
California corporate taxpayers, under the State's water's
edge alternative, may elect to limit their combined reporting
group to corporations in the unitary business whose individual presence in the United States surpasses a certain threshold. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §25110 (West 1992); see
Leegstra, Eager, & Stolte, The California Water's-Edge
Election, 6 J. St. Tax'n 195 (1987) (explaining operation of
California's water's edge system). The 1986 amendment
conditioned a corporate group's water's edge election on pay-

ment of a substantial fee, and allowed the California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) to disregard a water's edge
election under certain circumstances. In 1993, California
again modified its corporate franchise tax statute, this time
to allow domestic and foreign enterprises to elect water's
edge treatment without payment of a fee and without the
threat of disregard. 1993 Cal. Stats., ch. 31, § 53; id., ch. 881,
1Under the Internal Revenue Code, a foreign corporation reports only
income derived from a United States source or otherwise effectively connected with the corporation's conduct of a United States trade or business.
26 U. S. C. §§881, 882, 884, 864(c). Domestic corporations must report all
income, whether the source is domestic or foreign, § 11, though they receive a tax credit for qualifying taxes paid to foreign sovereigns, 26
U. S. C. §§ 901-908 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).

§22. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §25110 (West Supp.
1994). The new amendments became effective in January
1994.
C
The first of these consolidated cases, No. 92-1384, is a tax
refund suit brought by two members of the Barclays Group,
a multinational banking enterprise. Based in the United
Kingdom, the Barclays Group includes more than 220 corporations doing business in some 60 nations. The two refundseeking members of the Barclays eorporate family did business in California and were therefore subject to California's
franchise tax. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal), one of
the two taxpayers, was a California banking corporation
wholly owned by Barclays Bank International Limited
(BBI), the second taxpayer. BBI, a United Kingdom corporation, did business in the United Kingdom and in more than
33 other nations and territories.
In computing its California franchise tax based on 1977
income, Barcal reported only the income from its own operations. BBI reported income on the assumption that it
participated in a unitary business composed of itself and its
subsidiaries, but not its parent corporation and the parent's
other subsidiaries. After auditing BBI's and Barcal's 1977
income year franchise tax returns, the Tax Board, respondent here, determined that both were part of a worldwide
unitary business, the Barclays Group. Ultimately, the Tax
Board assessed additional tax liability of $1,678 for BBI and
$152,420 for Barcal.6

308 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

Barcal and BBI paid the assessments and sued for refunds.
They prevailed in California's lower courts, but were unsuccessful in California's Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court held that the tax did not impair the Federal
Government's ability to "speak with one voice" in regulating
foreign commerce, see Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los
Angeles, 441 U. S., at 449, and therefore did not violate the
Commerce Clause. Having so concluded, the California Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeal for
further development of Barclays' claim that the compliance
burden on foreign-based multinationals imposed by California's tax violated both the Due Process Clause and the nondiscrimination requirement of the Commerce Clause. Barclay's Bank Int'l, Ltd. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 2 Cal. 4th 708,
829 P. 2d 279, cert. denied, 506 U. S. 870 (1992). On remand,
the Court of Appeal decided the compliance burden issues
against Barclays, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1742, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 537
(3d Dist. 1992), and the California Supreme Court denied
further review. The case is therefore before us on writ of
certiorari to the California Court of Appeal. 510 U. S. 942
(1993). Barclays has conceded, for purposes of this litigation, that the entire Barclays Group formed a worldwide
unitary business in 1977.7
The petitioner in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co., is a
Delaware corporation headquartered in New York. Colgate
and its subsidiaries doing business in the United States
engaged principally in the manufacture and distribution of
household and personal hygiene products. In addition,
Colgate owned some 75 corporations that operated entirely
outside the United States; these foreign subsidiaries also

filed California franchise tax returns based on 1970-1973 income, it reported the income earned from its foreign operations on a separate accounting basis, Essentially, Colgate
maintained that the Constitution compelled California to
limit the reach of its unitary principle to the United States'
water's edge. See supra, at 306. The Tax Board determined that Colgate's taxes should be computed on the basis
of worldwide combined reporting, and assessed a 4-year deficiency of $604,765.8 Colgate paid the tax and sued for a
refund.
Colgate prevailed in the California Superior Court, which
found that the Federal Government had condemned worldwide combined reporting as impermissibly intrusive upon
the Nation's ability uniformly to regulate foreign commercial
relations. No. 319715 (Super. Ct. Sacramento Cty., Apr. 19,

raises two concerns in addition to the four delineated in
Complete Auto. The first is prompted by "the enhanced

between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise," Container Corp., 463 U. S.,
at 180-181 (internal quotation marks omitted); nor have the
petitioners shown that the income attributed to California is
"out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted
by the [taxpayers] in that State." Id., at 181 (internal quotation marks omitted). We note in this regard that, "if applied by every jurisdiction," California's method "would result in no more than all of the unitary business' income being
taxed." Id., at 169. And surely California has afforded
Colgate and the Barclays taxpayers "protection, opportunities and benefits" for which the State can exact a return.
Wisconsin v. J C. Penney Co., 311 U. S.435, 444 (1940); see
ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S., at 315.
Barclays (but not Colgate) vigorously contends, however,
that California's worldwide combined reporting scheme violates the antidiscrimination component of the Complete Auto
that "California had the requisite nexus with every member of the Barclays group," id., at 27 (emphasis added).
The trial court, however, did not reach the conclusion the United Kingdom suggests it did, nor was there cause for it so to do. As the United
Kingdom recognizes, the theory underlying unitary taxation is that "certain intangible 'flows of value' within the unitary group serve to link the
various members together as if they were essentially a single entity."
Id., at 26. Formulary apportionment of the income of a multijurisdictional (but unitary) business enterprise, if fairly done, taxes only the "income generated within a State." Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Director,Div. of
Taxation, 504 U. S., at 783 (upholding "unitary business principle" as "an
appropriate means for distinguishing between income generated within a
State and income generated without"). Quill held that the Commerce
Clause requires a taxpayer's "physical presence" in the taxing jurisdiction
before that jurisdiction can constitutionally impose a use tax. 504 U. S.,
at 317. The California presence of the taxpayers before us is undisputed,
and we find nothing in Quill to suggest that California may not reference
the income of corporations worldwide with whom those taxpayers are
closely intertwined in order to approximate the taxpayers' California
income.

test. Barclays maintains that a foreign owner of a taxpayer
filing a California tax return "is forced to convert its diverse
financial and accounting records from around the world into
the language, currency, and accounting principles of the
United States" at "prohibitiv[e]" expense: Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 44.11 Domestic-owned taxpayers,
by contrast, need not incur such expense because they "already keep most of their records in English, in United States
currency, and in accord with United States accounting principles." Id., at 45. Barclays urges that imposing this "prohibitive administrative burden," id., at 43, on foreign-owned
enterprises gives a competitive advantage to their United
States-owned counterparts and constitutes "economic protectionism" of the kind this Court has -often condemned.
Id., at 43-46.
Compliance burdens, if disproportionately imposed on
out-of-jurisdiction enterprises, may indeed be inconsonant
with the Commerce Clause. See, e.g., Hunt v. Washington
State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350-351
(1977) (increased costs imposed by North Carolina statute on
out-of-state apple producers "would tend to shield the local
apple industry from the competition of Washington apple
growers," thereby discriminating against those growers).
The factual predicate of Barclays' discrimination claim, however, is infirm.
Barclays points to provisions of California's implementing
regulations setting out three discrete means for a taxpayer
to fulfill its franchise tax reporting requirements. Each of
these modes of compliance would require Barclays to gather
and present much information not maintained by the unitary
" Barclays estimates, and the trial court found, that an accounting system capable of conveying the information Barclays thought California's
worldwide reporting scheme required for all of the enterprise's foreign
affiliates would cost more than $5 million to set up, and more than $2
million annually to maintain. Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 44,

group in the ordinary course of business. 2 California's regulations, however, also provide that the Tax Board "shall
consider the effort and expense required to obtain the necessary information" and, in "appropriate cases, such as when
the necessary data cannot be developed from financial records maintained in the regular course of business," may accept "reasonable approximations." Cal. Code of Regs., Title
18, § 25137-6(e)(1) (1985). As the Court of Appeal comprehended, in determining Barclays' 1977 worldwide income,
Barclays and the Tax Board "used these [latter] provisions
and [made] computations based on reasonable approximations," 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1756, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 545, thus
allowing Barclays to avoid the large compliance costs of
which it complains. 13 Barclays has not shown that California's provision for "reasonable approximations" systematically "overtaxes" foreign corporations generally or BBI or
Barcal in particular.
In sum, Barclays has not demonstrated that California's
tax system in fact operates to impose inordinate compliance
burdens on foreign enterprises. Barclays' claim of unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce therefore
fails.
III
Barclays additionally argues that California's "reasonable
approximations" method of reducing the compliance burden
12 Under the regulations to which Barclays refers, a "unitary business
with operations in foreign countries" may determine its worldwide income
based upon either (1) "[a] profit and loss statement ... for each foreign
branch or corporation," Cal. Code of Regs., Title 18, §25137-6(b)(1) (1985);
(2) the "consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for the related
corporations of which the unitary business is a member which is prepared
for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission," § 25137-6(b)(2);
or (3) "the consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for reporting
to shareholders and subject to review by an independent auditor," ibid.
13The California Court of Appeal additionally found that Barclays' actual compliance costs were "relatively modest" during the years just prior
to those here at issue, ranging from $900 to $1,250 per annum, for BBI.
See 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1760, n. 9, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 548, n. 9.

is incompatible with due process. "Foreign multinationals,"
Barclays maintains, "remain at peril in filing their tax returns because there is no standard to determine what 'approximations' will be accepted." Brief for Petitioner in No.
92-1384, at 49. Barclays presents no substantive grievance
concerning the treatment it has received, i. e., no example of
an approximation rejected by the Tax Board as unreasonable. Barclays instead complains that "[t]he grant of standardless discretion itself violates due process," so that the
taxpayer need not show "actual harm from arbitrary application." Ibid.
We note, initially, that "reasonableness" is a guide admitting effective judicial review in myriad settings, from encounters between the police and the citizenry, see Terry v.
Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 27 (1968) (Fourth Amendment permits police officer's limited search for weapons in circumstances
where "reasonably prudent man ...would be warranted in

the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger"
based upon "reasonable inferences... draw[n] from the facts
in light of [officer's] experience"), to the more closely analogous federal income tax context. See, e.g., 26 U.S. C.
§ 162(a)(1) (allowing deductions for ordinary business expenses, including a "reasonable allowance for salaries or
other compensation"); § 167(a) (permitting a "reasonable allowance" for wear and tear as a depreciation deduction); see
also United States v. Ragen, 314 U. S.513, 522 (1942) (noting
that determinations "by reference to a standard of 'reasonableness' [are] not unusual under federal income tax laws").
We next observe that California's judiciary has construed
the California law to curtail the discretion of California tax
officials. See 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1762, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at
549 (the Tax Board must consider "regularly-maintained or
other readily-accessibly corporate documents" in deciding
whether the "cost and effort of producing [worldwide combined reporting] information" justifies submission of "reasonable approximations"). We note, furthermore that California has afforded Barclays the opportunity "to clarify the

316 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

meaning of the regulation[s] by its own inquiry, or by resort
to an administrative process." See Hoffman Estates v.
Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 498 (1982).
Taxpayers, under the State's scheme, may seek "an advance
determination" from the Tax Board regarding the tax consequences of a proposed course of action. Cal. Code of Regs.,
Title 18, §25137-6(e)(2) (1985).
Rules governing international multijurisdictional income
allocation have an inescapable imprecision given the complexity of the subject matter. See Container Corp., 463
U. S., at 192 (allocation "bears some resemblance . . . to
slicing a shadow"). 14 Mindful that rules against vagueness
are not "mechanically applied" but depend, in their application, on "the nature of the enactment," Hoffman Estates,
455 U. S., at 498, we hold that California's scheme does not
transgress constitutional limitations in this regard, and that
Barclays' due process argument is no more weighty than
its claim of discrimination first placed under a Commerce
Clause heading.
IV
A
Satisfied that California's corporate franchise tax is
"proper and fair" as tested under Complete Auto's guides,
noted by the California Court of Appeal, even the federal separate
accounting scheme preferred by Barclays entails recourse to a standard
"akin to reasonable approximation." 10 Cal. App. 4th 1742, 1763, 14 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 537, 550 (1993). The Internal Revenue Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to "distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances" among a controlled group of businesses "if
he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income"
of such businesses. 26 U. S. C. § 482; see App. in No. 92-1384, p. A-829
(testimony of Barclays' expert witness that §482 requires "reasonable approximation[s]" of arm's-length prices); Peck v. Commissioner,752 F. 2d
469, 472 (CA9 1985) (under §482, Internal Revenue Service determination
of arm's-length prices will be sustained unless, unreasonable, arbitrary, or
capricious).

Opinion of the Court

see Container Coi-p., 463 U. S., at 184, we proceed to the
"additional scrutiny" required when a State seeks to tax foreign commerce. Id., at 185. First of the two additional
considerations is "the enhanced risk of multiple taxation."
Ibid.
In Container Corp., we upheld application of California's
combined reporting obligation to "foreign subsidiaries of
domestic corporations," id., at 193 (emphasis added), against
a charge that such application unconstitutionally exposed
those subsidiaries to a risk of multiple international taxation.15 Barclays contends that its situation compels a different outcome, because application of the combined reporting
obligation to foreign multinationals creates a "'more aggravated' risk.., of double taxation." Brief for Petitioner in
No. 92-1384, at 32, quoting Nos. 325059 and 325061 (Super.
Ct. Sacramento Cty., Aug. 20, 1987) (reprinted in App. to
Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384, p. A-26). Barclays rests its
argument on the observation that "foreign multinationals
typically have more of their operations and entities outside
of the United States [compared to] domestic multinationals,
which typically have a smaller share of their operations and
entities outside of the United States." Brief for Petitioner
in No. 92-1384, at 33.16 As a result, a higher proportion of
the income of a foreign multinational is subject to taxation
by foreign sovereigns. This reality, Barclays concludes,
means that for the foreign multinational, which must include
all its foreign operations in the California combined reporting group, "the breadth of double taxation and the degree of
burden on foreign commerce are greater than in the case of
domestic multinationals." Ibid.

reserved judgment on whether an altered analysis would be re-

quired where the taxpayer was part of a foreign-based enterprise. See

318 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

We do not question Barclays' assertion that multinational
enterprises with a high proportion of income taxed by jurisdictions with wage rates, property values, and sales prices
lower than California's face a correspondingly high risk of
multiple international taxation. See Container Corp., 463
U. S., at 187; cf. id., at 199-200 (Powell, J., dissenting) (describing how formulary apportionment leads to multiple taxation). Nor do we question that foreign-based multinationals have a higher proportion of such income, on average, than
do their United States counterparts. But ContainerCorp.'s
approval of this very tax, in the face of a multiple taxation
challenge, did not rest on any insufficiency in the evidence
that multiple taxation might occur; indeed, we accepted in
that case the taxpayer's assertion that multiple taxation in
fact had occurred. Id., at 187 ("[T]he tax imposed here, like
the tax in JapanLine, has resulted in actual double taxation,
in the sense that some of the income taxed without apportionment by foreign nations as attributable to appellant's foreign subsidiaries was also taxed by California as attributable
to the State's share of the total income of the unitary business of which those subsidiaries are a part."); see also id., at
187, n. 22.
Container Corp.'s holding on multiple taxation relied on
two considerations: first, that multiple taxation was not the
"inevitable result" of the California tax; 17 and, second, that
the "alternativ[e] reasonably available to the taxing State"
(i. e., some version of the separate accounting/"arm's length"
"The Court stated: "[T]he double taxation in this case, although real,
is not the 'inevitabl[e]' result of the California taxing scheme.... [W]e are
faced with two distinct methods of allocating the income of a multinational
enterprise. The 'arm's-length' approach divides the pie on the basis of
formal accounting principles. The formula apportionment method divides
the same pie on the basis of a mathematical generalization. Whether the
combination of the two methods results in the same income being taxed
twice or in some portion of income not being taxed at all is dependent
solely on the facts of the individual case." Container Corp., 463 U. S., at
188 (citation omitted).

Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

approach), id., at 188-189, "could not eliminate the risk of
double taxation" and might in some cases enhance that risk.
Id., at 191.18 We underscored that "even though most nations have adopted the arm's-length approach in its general
outlines, the precise rules underwhich they reallocate income among affiliated corporations often differ substantially,
and whenever that difference exists, the possibility of double
taxation also exists." Ibid. (emphasis added); see also id.,
at 192 ("California would have trouble avoiding multiple taxation even if it adopted the 'arm's-length' approach .. .
These considerations are not dispositively diminished
when California's tax is applied to the components of foreign,
as opposed to domestic, multinationals. Multiple taxation of
such entities because of California's scheme is not "inevitable'; the existence vel non of actual multiple taxation of income remains, as in ContainerCorp., dependent "on the facts
of the individual case." Id., at 188. And if, as we have held,
adoption of a separate accounting system does not dispositively lessen the risk of multiple taxation of the income
earned by foreign affiliates of domestic-owned corporations,
we see no reason why it would do so in respect of the income
earned by foreign affiliates of foreign-owned corporations.
We refused in ContainerCorp. "to require California to give
up one allocation method that sometimes results in double
taxation in favor of another allocation method that also
sometimes results in double taxation." Id., at 193. The
18The Court's decision in ContainerCorp. effectively modified, for purposes of income taxation, the Commerce Clause multiple taxation inquiry
described in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434
(1979) (holding unconstitutional application of California's ad valorem
property tax to cargo containers based in Japan and used exclusively in
foreign commerce). In Japan Line, confronting a property tax on containers used as "instrumentalities of [foreign] commerce," not an income
tax on companies, we said that a state tax is incompatible with the Commerce Clause if it "creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation." Id., at 451.

320 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

foreign domicile of the taxpayer (or the taxpayer's parent) is
a factor inadequate to warrant retraction of that position.
Recognizing that multiple taxation of international enterprise may occur whatever taxing scheme the State adopts,
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, dissenting in No. 92-1384, finds impermissible under "the [dormant] Foreign Commerce Clause"
only double taxation that (1) burdens a foreign corporation
in need of protection for lack of access to the political process, and (2) occurs "because [the State] does not conform to
international practice." Post, at 336. But the image of a
politically impotent foreign transactor is surely belied by the
battalion of foreign governments that has marched to Barclays' aid, deploring worldwide combined reporting in diplomatic notes, amicus briefs, and even retaliatory legislation.
See infra, at 324, n. 22; post, at 337. Indeed, California
responded to this impressive political activity when it
eliminated mandatory worldwide combined reporting. See
supra, at 306. In view of this activity, and the control rein
Congress holds, see infra, at 329-331,'we cannot agree that
"international practice" has such force as to dictate this
Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. We therefore
adhere to the precedent set in Container Corp.
B
We turn, finally, to the question ultimately and most ener-

getically presented; Did California's worldwide combined reporting requirement, as applied to Barcal, BBI, and Colgate,
"impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 448; in particular,
did the State's taxing scheme "preven[t] the Federal Government from 'speaking with one voice' in international trade"?
Id., at 453, quoting Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S.,
at 285.

Two decisions principally inform our judgment: first, this
Court's 1983 determination in Container Corp.; and second,
our decision three years later in Wardair Canada Inc. v.

Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986). Container
Corp. held that California's worldwide combined reporting
requirement, as applied to domestic corporations with foreign subsidiaries, did not violate the "one voice" standard.
Container Corp. bears on Colgate's case, but not Barca's or
BBI's, to this extent: "IT]he tax [in Container Corp.] was
imposed, not on a foreign entity . . . , but on a domestic
corporation." 463 U. S., at 195.19 Other factors emphasized
in Container Corp., however, are relevant to the complaints
of all three taxpayers in the consolidated cases now before
us. 20 Most significantly, the Court found no "specific indications of congressional intent" to preempt California's tax:
"First, there is no claim here that the federal tax statutes themselves provide the necessary pre-emptive
force. Second, although the United States is a party to
a great number of tax treaties that require the Federal
Government to adopt some form of 'arm's-length' analysis in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises, that requirement is generally waived with respect to the taxes imposed by each of the contracting
nations on its own domestic corporations.... Third, the
tax treaties into which the United States has entered do
not generally cover the taxing activities of subnational
governmental units such as States, and in none of the

ContainerCorp. noted:
"We recognize that the fact that legal incidence of a tax falls on a corpo-

ration whose formal corporate domicile is domestic might be less significant in the case of a domestic corporation that was owned by foreign interests. We need not decide here whether such a case would require us to
alter our analysis." 463 U. S., at 195, n. 32.
2oContainerCorp. observed that "the tax here does not create an automatic 'asymmetry'. . . in international taxation," id., at 194-195, quoting

Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 453-i. e., it does not inevitably lead to double
taxation. See supra, at 319-320, and n. 17. Furthermore, Colgate, Barcal, and BBI are "without a doubt amenable to be taxed in California in
one way or another," and "the amount of tax [they] pa[y] is much more
the function of California's tax rate than of its allocation method." 463

U. S., at 195.

322 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of the Court

treaties does the restriction on 'non-arm's-length' methods of taxation apply to the States. Moreover, the Senate has on at least one occasion, in considering a proposed treaty, attached a reservation declining to give
its consent to a provision in the treaty that would have
extended that restriction to the States. Finally, ...
Congress has long debated, but has not enacted, legislation designed to regulate state taxation of income."
Id., at 196-197 (footnotes and internal quotation marks
omitted).
The Court again confronted a "one voice" argument in
WardairCanada Inc. v. FloridaDept. of Revenue, 477 U. S.
1 (1986), and there rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to
Florida's tax on the sale of fuel to common carriers, including
airlines. Air carriers were taxed on all aviation fuel purchased in Florida, without regard to the amount the carrier
consumed within the State or the amount of its in-state business. The carrier in Wardair,a Canadian airline that operated charter flights to and from the United States, conceded
that the challenged tax satisfied the Complete Auto criteria
and entailed no threat of multiple international taxation.
Joined by the United States as amicus curiae, however, the
carrier urged that Florida's tax "threaten[ed] the ability of
the Federal Government to 'speak with one voice."' 477
U. S., at 9. There is "a federal policy," the carrier asserted,
"of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, and
supplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic"; this policy, the carrier argued, "represents the statement that the 'one voice'
of the Federal Government wishes to make," a statement
"threatened by [Florida's tax]." Ibid.
This Court disagreed, observing that the proffered evidence disclosed no federal policy of the kind described and
indeed demonstrated that the Federal Government intended
to permit the States to impose sales taxes on aviation fuel.
The international convention and resolution and more than
70 bilateral treaties on which the carrier relied to show a

Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

United States policy of tax exemption for the instrumentalities of international air traffic, the Court explained, in fact
indicated far less: "[W]hile there appears to be an international aspiration on the one hand to eliminate all impediments to foreign air travel-including taxation of fuel-the
law as it presently stands acquiesces in taxation of the sale
of that fuel by political subdivisions of countries." Id., at
10 (emphasis in original). Mobt of the bilateral agreements
prohibited the Federal Government from imposing national
taxes on aviation fuel used by foreign carriers, but none prohibited the States or their subdivisions from taxing the sale
of fuel to foreign airlines. The Court concluded that "[b]y
negative implication arising out of [these international accords,] the United States has at least acquiesced in state taxation of fuel used by foreign carriers in international travel,"
and therefore upheld Florida's tax. Id., at 12.
In both Wardair and Container Corp., the Court considered the "one voice" argument only after determining that
the challenged state action was otherwise constitutional.
An important premise underlying both decisions 21 is this:
Congress may more passively indicate that certain state
practices do not "impair federal uniformity in an area where
federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at
448; it need not convey its intent with the unmistakable clarity required to permit state regulation that discriminates
against interstate commerce or otherwise falls short under
Complete Auto inspection. See, e. g., Maine v. Taylor, 477
U. S. 131, 139 (1986) (requiring an "unambiguous indication
of congressional intent" to insulate "otherwise invalid state
legislation" from judicial dormant Commerce Clause scru21

As in ContainerCorp. and Wardair,we discern no "specific
indications of congressional intent" to bar the state action
here challenged. Our decision upholding California's franchise tax in Container Corp. left the ball in Congress' court;
had Congress, the branch responsible for the regulation of
foreign commerce, see U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, considered nationally uniform use of separate accounting "essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 448, it could have enacted
legislation prohibiting the gtates from ftating eorporato in-

In the 11 years that have elapsed since our decision in Container Corp., Congress has failed to enact such legislation.
In the past three decades-both before and after Container Corp.-Congress, aware that foreign governments
were displeased with States' worldwide combined reporting
requirements,21 has on many occasions studied state taxation
12The governments of many of our trading partners have expressed

their strong disapproval of California's method of taxation, as demonstrated by the amici briefs in support of Barclays from the Government
of the United Kingdom, and from the Member States of the European
Communities (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) and the governments
of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Barclays has also directed our attention to a series of diplomatic
notes similarly protesting the tax. See, e. g., App. in No. 92-1384, at A-92
to A-123, A-127 to A-128, A-131 to A-138; see also p. A-603 (letter from
Secretary of State George Schultz to California Governor Deukmejian
(Jan. 30, 1986)) ("The Department of State has received diplomatic notes
complaining about state use of the worldwide unitary method of taxation
from virtually every developed country in the world."). The British Parliament has gone further, enacting retaliatory legislation that would, if
implemented, tax United States corporations on dividends they receive
from their United Kingdom subsidiaries. See Finance Act 1985, pt. 2,

The numerous bills intro-

duced have varied, but all would have prohibited the California reporting requirement here challenged. One group of
bills would have prohibited States using combined reporting
from compelling inclusion, in the combined reporting group,
of corporate affiliates whose income was derived substanPursuant to §201 of Pub. L. 86-272, 73 Stat. 556, in which Congress
undertook to "make full and complete studies of all matters pertaining to
the taxation ... of interstate commerce ... by the States," the House
Committee on the Judiciary held extensive hearings on the (primarily domestic) implications of alternative tax apportionment schemes. See State
Income Taxation of Mercantile and Manufacturing Corporations: Hearings
before the Special Subcommittee on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Sess.
(1961). The Subcommittee's comprehensive final Report recommended,
inter alia, that "formula apportionment be used as the sole method of
dividing income among the States for tax purposes," State Taxation of
Interstate Commerce: Report of the Special Subcommittee on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce, House Committee on the Judiciary, H. R.
Rep. No. 952, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1144 (1965), and that States be required
to refrain from taxing any foreign income exempt from federal taxation.
Id., at 1135. Congress, however, enacted no legislation embodying these
recommendations.
Congress continued to study and debate this matter over the next two
decades. See Interstate Taxation Act, H. R. 11798 and Companion Bills:

would have barred the States from requiring taxpayers to
report any income that was not subject to federal income
tax;21 thus, "foreign source income" of foreign corporations
ordinarily would not be reported. See supra, at 209, n. 5.

None of these bills, however, was enacted.
The history of Senate action on a United States/United
Kingdom tax treaty, to which we referred in Container
Corp., see 463 U.S., at 196, reinforces our conclusion that
Congress implicitly has permitted the States to use the
worldwide combined reporting method. As originally negotiated by the President, this treaty-known as the Convention for Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital
Gains-would have precluded States from requiring that
United Kingdom-controlled corporate taxpayers use combined reporting to compute their state income. See Art.

British nationals, Art. 2(4), 31 U. S. T. 5671; Art. 24, id., at

Given these indicia of Congress' willingness to tolerate
States' worldwide combined reporting mandates, even when
those mandates are applied to foreign corporations and domestic corporations with foreign parents, we cannot conclude
that "the foreign policy of the United States-whose nuances
.,. are much more the province of the Executive Branch and
Congress than of this Court-is [so] seriously threatened,"

to warrant our intervention. 28 For this reason, Barclays'

income tax liability of multinational corporations," does not render a
State's use of a different method unconstitutional, as the Solicitor General
points out. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17-18 (emphasis in
original), citing Mobil Oil Corp.v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S.
425, 448 (1980) ("Concurrent federal and state taxation of income, of

enlist them. The Constitution expressly grants Congress,
not the President, the power, to "regulate Commerce with
foreign Nations." U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. As we
have detailed, supra, at 324-327, and nn. 23-27, Congress
has focused its attention on this issue, but has refrained from
exercising its authority to prohibit state-mandated worldwide combined reporting. That the Executive Branch proposed legislation to outlaw a state taxation practice, but encountered an unreceptive Congress, is not evidence that the
practice interfered with the Nation's ability to speak with
one voice, but is rather evidence that the preeminent speaker
decided to yield the floor to others. Cf. Itel ContainersInt'l
Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 81 (1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[The President] is better able to decide than we are which state regulatory interests should currently be subordinated to our
national interest in foreign commerce. Under the Constitution, however, neither he nor we were to make that decision,
but only Congress.").

over foreign commerce to the President," who "also possesses in his own right certain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as Commander-in-Chief and as the Nation's

2The

Solicitor General suggests that when a court analyzes "whether a
state tax impairs the federal government's ability to speak with one voice
... the statements of executive branch officials are entitled to substantial
evidentiary weight," Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, but he
argues that the constitutionality of a State's taxing practice must be assessed according to the federal policy, if any, in effect at the time the
challenged taxes were assessed. He asserts that federal officials had not
articulated a policy opposing use by the States of worldwide combined
reporting prior to the mid-1980's, and urges the Court to affirm the judgments below on the ground that California's use of worldwide combined
reporting was not unconstitutional during the years here at issue, even if
it became unconstitutional in later years (a question on which he takes no
position, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-41). Colgate, on the other hand, suggests
that the relevant time frame is "when the tax is definitively enforced by
the state taxing authority, through judicial proceedings if necessary, not
when the tax technically accrues under state law," Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 7, and argues in the alternative that a federal
policy opposing combined worldwide reporting had been established as of
1970-1973, id., at 9. We need not resolve this dispute, because we have
concluded that the Executive statements criticizing States' use of worldwide combined reporting do not, in light of Congress' acquiescence in the
States' actions, authorize judicial intervention here.

we leave it to Congress-whose voice, in this area, is the
Nation's-to evaluate whether the national interest is best
served by tax uniformity, or state autonomy. Accordingly,
the judgments of the California Court of Appeal are
Affirmed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring.

.Last Term, in Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston,
507 U. S. 60, 85 (1993) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting), I expressed my disagreement with the Court's willingness, in
applying the "one voice" test, to "infe[r] permission for [a]
tax from Congress' supposed failure to prohibit it." See also
Wardair CanadaInc. v. FloridaDept. of Revenue, 477 U. S.
1, 18 (1986) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). I accordingly would
not rely in the present cases on congressional inaction to
conclude that "Congress implicitly has permitted the States
to use the worldwide combined reporting method." Ante,
at 326. Nevertheless, because today's holding largely is controlled by ContainerCorp. of America v. FranchiseTax Bd.,
463 U. S. 159 (1983), and because California's corporate franchise tax does not directly burden the instrumentalities of
foreign commerce, see Itel, supra; Wardair, supra; and
Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434
(1979), I agree that the tax does not "impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," id., at
448. I therefore join the opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
I concur. in the judgment of the Court and join all of its
opinion except Part IV-B, which disposes of the petitioners'
"negative" Foreign Commerce Clause argument by applying
the "speak with one voice" test of Japan Line, Ltd. v. County
of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434 (1979).
As I stated last Term in Itel ContainersInt'l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 78 (1993) (opinion concurring in part

332 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

and concurring in judgment), "I will enforce a self-executing,

'negative' Commerce Clause in two circumstances: (1)
against a state law that facially discriminates against interstate [or foreign] commerce, and (2) against a state law that
is indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court." Id., at 78-79 (footnote omitted).
Absent one of these circumstances, I will permit the States
to employ whatever means of taxation they choose insofar as
the Commerce Clause is concerned. Neither circumstance
exists here, and the California tax therefore survives Commerce Clause attack.
I am not sure that the Court's opinion today, which requires no more than legislative inaction to establish that
"Congress implicitly has permitted" the States to impose a
particular restriction on foreign commerce, ante, at 326, will
prove much different from my approach in its consequences.
It is, moreover, an unquestionable improvement over Itel:
whereas the "speak with one voice" analysis of that opinion
gave the power to determine the constitutionality of a state
law to the Executive Branch, see 507 U. S., at 80 (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), today's opinion restores the power to Congress-albeit in a form that
strangely permits it to be exercised by silence.
joins,
concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
I joined Justice Powell in dissent in Container Corp. of
America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159 (1983), and I
continue to think the Court erred in upholding California's
use of worldwide combined reporting in taxing the income
of a domestic-based corporate group. But because the State
and private parties have justifiably relied on the constitutionality of taxing such corporations, and Congress has not
seen fit to override our decision, I agree with the Court that
Container Corp. should not be overruled, cf. Quill Corp. v.
North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 318-319 (1992), and that it

resolves the constitutional challenge raised by ColgatePalmolive. I therefore concur in the judgment in No. 921839. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, is a foreign-based
parent company of a multinational corporate group, and our
holding in Container Corp. expressly does not extend to this
situation. See 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26, and 195, n. 32. In my
view, the California tax cannot constitutionally be applied
to foreign corporations. I therefore respectfully dissent in
No. 92-1384.
A state tax on interstate commerce must meet four requirements under our negative Commerce Clause precedents: the tax must be on an activity with a substantial
nexus to the taxing State, it must be fairly apportioned, it
must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it
must be fairly related to the services provided by the State.
Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279
(1977). Substantially for the reasons explained by the
Court, see ante, at 311-314, I agree that imposition of the
California tax complies with the four Complete Auto factors.
(I also agree that California's practice of accepting "reasonable approximations" of the statutorily required financial
data does not violate due process. See ante, at 314-316.)
A state tax on foreign commerce, however, must satisfy two
additional inquiries: "first, whether the tax, notwithstanding
apportionment, creates a substantial risk of international
multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax prevents the
Federal Government from 'speaking with one voice when
regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.'
If a state tax contravenes either of these precepts, it is
unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause." JapanLine,
Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 451 (1979) (emphasis added).
I am in general agreement with the Court, see ante, at
320-329, that the second Japan Line factor-the purported
need for federal uniformity-does not prevent the use of
worldwide combined reporting in taxing foreign corpora-

334 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

tions. The Congress, not the Executive or the Judiciary, has
been given the power to regulate commerce. U. S. Const.,
Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. The Legislature has neither approved nor
disapproved the California tax. Although in such circumstances courts have the power to scrutinize taxes for consistency with our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence,
this determination should be made on the basis of the objective factors outlined in Complete Auto (and, in the foreign
commerce context, the multiple taxation analysis discussed
in JapanLine), not statements made and briefs filed by officials in the Executive Branch. Cf. Itel Containers Int'l
Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 80-81 (1993) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Indeed,
the inconsistent positions taken by the Solicitor General in
the course of Barclays' challenge to the California tax illustrate the perils of resting constitutional determinations on
such "evidence." Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae21-24 (arguing that the California tax was constitutionally applied to Barclays during the tax years in question), with Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in
Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board, 0. T. 1992, No. 92212, pp. 9-16 (arguing that the imposition of the California
tax on Barclays was unconstitutional).
But I cannot agree with the Court'g regolution of the other
Japan Line factor-the need to avoid international multiple taxation. See ante, at 316-320. Barclays does 98% of
its business in countries other than the United States. California, through application of worldwide combined reporting, taxes some of that income. The trial court found as
a fact that "[t]here is a definite risk of, as well as actual
double taxation here." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384,
p. A-25. This double taxation occurs because California has
adopted a taxing system that is inconsistent with the taxing
method used by foreign taxing authorities. California's formula assigns a higher proportion of income to jurisdictions
where wage rates, property values, and sales prices are

Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

higher; to the extent that California is such a jurisdiction
(and it usually will be) the formula inherently leads to double
taxation. And whenever the three factors are higher in California, the State will tax income under its formula that
already has been taxed by another country under accepted
international practice.
In Container Corp., we recognized that the California tax
"ha[d] resulted in actual double taxation... stem[ming] from
a serious divergence in the taxing schemes adopted by California and the foreign taxing authorities," and that "the taxing method adopted by those foreign taxing authorities is
consistent with accepted international practice." 462 U. S.,
at 187. We nevertheless held that the tax did not violate
the Japan Line principle. Two of the factors on which we
relied-that the tax was on income rather than property, and
that the multiple taxation was not "inevitable"-carry no
more force today than they did 11 Terms ago, see 463 U. S.,
at 198-201 (Powell, J., dissenting), but they are present here
as well.
We also relied on a third ground to distinguish the tax
upheld in Container Corp. from the tax invalidated in Japan
Line: "[T]he tax here falls; not on the foreign owners of an
instrumentality of foreign commerce, but on a corporation
domiciled and headquartered in the United States. We specifically left open in Japan Line the application of that case
to 'domestically owned instrumentalities engaged in foreign
commerce,' and ... this case falls clearly within that reservation." 463 U. S., at 188-189, quoting Japan Line, supra, at
444, n. 7 (citation omitted). In a footnote, we continued: "We
have no need to address in this opinion the constitutionality
of [the California tax] with respect to state taxation of domestic corporations with foreign parents or foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries."
463 U. S., at 189, n. 26; see also id., at 195, and n. 32. As the
Court recognizes, ante, at 317, and n. 15, Barclays' challenge
to the California tax therefore presents the question we ex-

336 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

pressly left open in ContainerCorp.: does it make a constitutional difference that the multiple taxation resulting from
California's use of worldwide combined reporting falls on
a foreign corporation rather than a domestic one? In my
view, the answer is yes.
Japan Line teaches that where the instrumentality of
commerce-and analogously, the corporate domicile-is foreign, the multiple taxation resulting from a state taxing
scheme may violate the Commerce Clause even though the
same tax would be constitutional as applied to a domestic
corporation. 441 U. S., at 447-448. When worldwide combined reporting is applied to American corporate groups
with foreign affiliates, as in Container Corp., income attributable to those foreign companies will be taxed by California,

ovon though they are also subject to tax in foreign countries.
But in such cases the incidence of the tax falls on the domestic parent corporation-a corporation subject to full taxation
in the United States notwithstanding the source of its income. When the California tax is applied to a foreign corporate group with both domestic and foreign affiliates, some of
the income of the foreign companies will also be taxed by
California. The incidence of the tax in such cases falls on a
foreign corporation, even though the United States (and its
subnational governments) is entitled to tax only the income
earned domestically.
In my view, the States are prohibited (absent express congressional authorization) by the Foreign Commerce Clause
from adopting a system of taxation that, because it does not
conform to international practice, results in multiple taxation of foreign corporations. It may be that such a rule
"leave[s] California free to discriminate against a Delaware
corporation in favor of an overseas corporation," Container
Corp., 463 U. S., at 203 (Powell, J., dissenting), but the reason
for this differential treatment is obvious. Domestic taxpayers have access to the political process, at both the state and
national levels, that foreign taxpayers simply do not enjoy.

Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

If California's tax results in intolerable double taxation of
domestic corporations, those companies can seek redress
through the normal channels. Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf
Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 473, n. 17 (1981); Raymond
Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 444, n. 18 (1978).
It is all too easy, however, for the state legislature to fill the
State's coffers at the expense of outsiders.
Most of the United States' trading partners have objected
to California's use of worldwide combined reporting. See
D~marche from Danish Embassy, on behalf of Governments
of European Community (Mar. 26, 1993) ("The views of the
EC Member States on worldwide unitary taxation are well
known to the United States Government. All Member
States have expressed their strong opposition to [the California] tax in a number of diplomatic communiques to the
United States Government from 1980 to the present date");
D~marche from Belgian Embassy, on behalf of Governments
of Member States of European Community and of Australia,
Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland (Sept. 23, 1993). At least one country has already
enacted retaliatory legislation. See Brief for Government
of United Kingdom as Amicus Curiae19-23. Moreover, the.
possibility of multiple taxation undoubtedly deters foreign
investment in this country. See Brief for Member States
of European Communities et al. as Amici Curiae 14-16.
These adverse consequences, which affect the Nation as a
whole, result solely from California's refusal to conform its
taxing practices to the internationally accepted standard.
Unlike the Court, see ante, at 319, I would not dismiss these
difficulties solely by relying on our observation in Container
Corp. that "it would be perverse, simply for the sake of
avoiding double taxation, to require California to give up one
allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation
in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes
results in double taxation." 463 U. S., at 193. In addition
to being factually incorrect, see id., at 199, n. 1 (Powell, J.,

338 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

dissenting), our discussion of alternatives in ContainerCorp.
proceeded from the well-established proposition that States
need not conform their taxing practices to those of their
neighbors, at least so far as domestic commerce is concerned.
See, e. g., Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 277-281
(1978). Multiple taxation of domestic companies is avoided,
to the extent necessary, by the fair apportionment requirement. See Container Corp., supra, at 185; General Motors
Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 440 (1964).
But in JapanLine we squarely rejected the argument that
the same principle applies to taxes imposed on foreignowned instrumentalities:
"[N]either this Court nor this Nation can ensure full apportionment when one of the taxing entities is a foreign
sovereign. If an instrumentality of commerce is domiciled abroad, the country of domicile may have the right,
consistently with the custom of nations, to impose a tax
on its full value. If a State should seek to tax the same
instrumentality on an apportioned basis, multiple taxation inevitably results. . . . Due to the absence of an
authoritative tribunal capable of ensuring that the aggregation of taxes is computed on no more than one full
value, a state tax, even though 'fairly apportioned' to
reflect an instrumentality's presence within the State,
may subject foreign commerce to the risk of a double
tax burden to which [domestic] commerce is not
exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids." 441
U. S., at 447-448 (footnote and internal quotation
marks omitted).
In my view, the risk of multiple taxation created by California's use of worldwide combined reporting-a risk that
has materialized with respect to Barclays-is sufficient to
render the California tax constitutionally infirm. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion to the
contrary.
