TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA
No. 93-5131.

Argued March 22, 1994-Decided June 30, 1994"

A defendant in California is eligible for the death penalty when a jury
finds him guilty of first-degree murder and finds one or more of the
special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2. The case
then proceeds to the penalty phase, where the jury is instructed to
consider numerous other factors listed in § 190.3 in deciding whether
to impose death. Petitioners Tuilaepa and Proctor were convicted of
first-degree murder in separate cases. At the penalty phase of each
trial, the jury was instructed to consider the relevant sentencing factors
in § 190.3. Both petitioners were sentenced to death, and the State
Supreme Court affirmed. Here, they challenge the constitutionality of
penalty-phase factor (a), which requires the sentencer to consider the
"circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted...

and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true." Tuilaepa also challenges factor (b), which requires the sentencer to consider
the "presence or absence of criminal activity [involving] the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use
force or violence," and factor (i), which requires the sentencer to consider the defendant's age at the time of the crime.
Held- The factors in question are not unconstitutionally vague under
this Court's decisions construing the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause. Pp. 971-980.
(a) The Court's vagueness review is quite deferential, and relies on
the basic principle that a factor is not unconstitutional if it has some
"common-sense core of meaning... that criminal juries should be capable of understanding." Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 279 (White, J.,
concurring in judgment). Petitioners' challenge to factor (a) is at some
odds with settled principles, for the circumstances of the crime are a
traditional subject for consideration by the sentencer, see, e. g., Woodson
v. North Carolina,428 U. S. 280, 304 (plurality opinion), and factor (a)
instructs the jury in understandable terms. Factor (b) is framed in
conventional and understandable terms as well. Asking a jury to consider matters of historical fact is a permissible part of the sentencing
process. Tuilaepa's challenge to factor (i) is also unusual in light of the

Court's precedents. See Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115-117.
While determining the bearing age ought to have in fixing the penalty
can pose a dilemma for the jury, difficulty in application is not the equivalent of vagueness. Pp. 971-977.
(b) This Court's precedents also foreclose petitioners' remaining arguments. Selection factors need not require answers to factual questions.
The States are not confined to submitting to the jury specific propositional questions, see, e. g., Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878-880, 889,
and there is no constitutional problem where an instruction directs consideration of a crime's facts and circumstances. Nor must a capital sentencer be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the sentencing
decision. See, e. g., California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1008-1009.

In California, to sentence a defendant to death for firstdegree murder the trier of fact must find the defendant
guilty and also find one or more of 19 special circumstances
listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.2 (West 1988 and Supp.
1994). The case then proceeds to the penalty phase, where

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court

Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth
Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.
I
Petitioner Tuilaepa's case arises out of a murder he committed in Long Beach, California, in October 1986. Tuilaepa
and an accomplice walked into the Wander Inn Bar in Long
Beach, where a small crowd had gathered to watch Monday
Night Football. Tuilaepa, who was carrying a .22-caliber
rifle, approached the bartender, pointed the rifle at him, and
demanded money from the cash register. After the bartender turned over the money, Tuilaepa and his accomplice
began robbing the bar's patrons. When the accomplice demanded money from a man named Melvin Whiddon, Whiddon refused and knocked the accomplice to the floor. Tuilaepa shot Whiddon in the neck and next shot Whiddon's
brother, Kelvin, who was standing nearby. Tuilaepa turned
to another man, Bruce Monroe, and shot him in the stomach.
As Tuilaepa and his accomplice ran toward the back door,
they confronted Kenneth Boone. Tuilaepa shot Boone in the
neck. Melvin Whiddon died at the scene from the gunshot
wounds; the others suffered serious and in some cases permanent injuries.
The State sought the death penalty against Tuilaepa,
charging him with the murder of Melvin Whiddon and one
special circumstance under § 190.2: murder during the commission of a robbery. The jury found Tuilaepa guilty of
first-degree murder and also found the special circumstance
true. At the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed the
jury to consider the relevant sentencing factors specified in
§ 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Tuilaepa to
death.
Petitioner Proctor murdered Bonnie Stendal, a 55-year-old
schoolteacher who lived in Burney, a small community in
Shasta County, California. On a night in April 1982, Proctor
entered Mrs. Stendal's home and beat her, causing numerous

Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

cuts and bruises on her face. Proctor stabbed Mrs. Stendal
in the neck several times and inflicted seven stab wounds in
the area of the right breast. Proctor raped Mrs. Stendal
and committed further sexual assaults with a foreign object.
After beating, torturing, and raping Mrs. Stendal, Proctor
strangled her to death and dumped her body on the side of
the road near Lake Britton, 12 miles from Burney. The
body was found late the next afternoon, clad in a nightgown
with hands tied behind the back.
The State sought the death penalty against Proctor, charging him with murder and a number of special circumstances
under § 190.2 including murder during the commission of a
rape, murder during the commission of a burglary, and infliction of torture during a murder. The jury found Proctor
guilty of murder and found the three special circumstances
true. After a mistrial at the penalty phase, Proctor's motion for change of venue was granted, and a new sentencing
jury was empaneled in Sacramento County. The trial judge
instructed the jury to consider the sentencing factors specified in § 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Proctor to death.
Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court of California,
which affirmed their convictions and death sentences.
No. 93-5131, 4 Cal. 4th 569, 842 P. 2d 1142 (1992), and
No. 93-5161, 4 Cal. 4th 499, 842 P. 2d 1100 (1992). We
granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1010 (1993), and now affirm.
II
A
Our capital punishment cases under the Eighth Amendment address two different aspects of the capital decisionmaking process: the eligibility decision and the selection decision. To be eligible for the death penalty, the defendant
must be convicted of a crime for which the death penalty is
a proportionate punishment. Coker v. Georgia,433 U. S. 584
(1977). To render a defendant eligible for the death penalty

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
Opinion of the Court

in a homicide case, we have indicated that the trier of fact
must convict the defendant of murder and find one "aggravating circumstance" (or its equivalent) at either the guilt or
penalty phase. See, e. g., Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S.
231, 244-246 (1988); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878
(1983). The aggravating circumstance may be contained in
the definition of the crime or in a separate sentencing factor
(or in both). Lowenfield, supra, at 244-246. As we have
explained, the aggravating circumstance must meet two requirements. First, the circumstance may not apply to every
defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants convicted of murder. See Arave v.
Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993) ("If the sentencer fairly
could conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies to
every defendant eligible for the death penalty, the circumstance is constitutionally infirm"). Second, the aggravating
circumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague. Godfrey
v. Georgia,446 U. S. 420, 428 (1980); see Arave, supra, at 471
(court "'must first determine whether the statutory language defining the circumstance is itself too vague to provide
any guidance to the sentencer'") (quoting Walton: v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 654 (1990)).
We have imposed a separate requirement for the selection
decision, where the sentencer determines whether a defendant eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive that
sentence. "What is important at the selection stage is an
individualized determination on the basis of the character
of the individual and the circumstances of the crime." Zant,
supra,at 879; see also Woodson v. North Carolina,428 U. S.
280, 303-304 (1976) (plurality opinion). That requirement is
met when the jury can consider relevant mitigating evidence
of the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime. Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S.
299, 307 (1990) ("requirement of individualized sentencing in
capital cases is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all

Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

relevant mitigating evidence"); see Johnson v. Texas, 509
U. S. 350, 361 (1993).
The eligibility decision fits the crime within a defined classification. Eligibility factors almost of necessity require an
answer to a question with a factual nexus to the crime or
the defendant so as to "make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death." Arave, supra, at 471
(internal quotation marks omitted). The selection decision,
on the other hand, requires individualized sentencing and
must be expansive enough to accommodate relevant mitigating evidence so as to assure an assessment of the defendant's
culpability. The objectives of these two inquiries can be in
some tension, at least when the inquiries occur at the same
time. See Romano v. Oklahoma, ante, at 6 (referring to
"two somewhat contradictory tasks"). There is one principle common to both decisions, however: The State must ensure that the process is neutral and principled so as to guard
against bias or caprice in the sentencing decision. See
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976) (joint opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (procedures must "minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action").
That is the controlling objective when we examine eligibility and selection factors for vagueness. Indeed, it is the
reason that eligibility and selection factors (at least in some
sentencing schemes) may not be "too vague." Walton,
supra, at 654; see Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,
361-364 (1988).
Because "the proper degree of definition" of eligibility and
selection factors often "is not susceptible of mathematical
precision," our vagueness review is quite deferential. Walton, supra, at 655; see Gregg, supra, at 193-194 (factors "are
by necessity somewhat general"). Relying on the basic
principle that a factor is not unconstitutional if it has some
''common-sense core of meaning . . . that criminal juries
should be capable of understanding," Jurek v. Texas, 428
U. S.262, 279 (1976) (White, J., concurring in judgment), we

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
Opinion of the Court

have found only a few factors vague, and those in fact
are quite similar to one another. See Maynard, supra, at
363-364 (question whether murder was "especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel"); Godfrey, supra, at 427-429 (question
whether murder was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"); cf. Arave, 507 U. S., at 472 ("We are not
faced with pejorative adjectives ...that describe a crime as
a whole"). In providing for individualized sentencing, it
must be recognized that the States may adopt capital sentencing processes that rely upon the jury, in its sound judgment, to exercise wide discretion. That is evident from the
numerous factors we have upheld against vagueness challenges. See, e.g., id., at 472-473 (question whether the defendant was a "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" is not unconstitutionally vague); Walton, supra, at 654 (question whether
"perpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death" with "[m]ental anguish includ[ing] a
victim's uncertainty as to his ultimate fate" is not unconstitutionally vague) (internal quotation marks omitted); Proffitt
v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 255-258 (1976) (joint opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (various "mitigating"
questions not unconstitutionally vague, nor is the question
whether the crime was a "conscienceless or pitiless crime
which [wa]s unnecessarily torturous to the victim") (internal
quotation marks omitted); Jurek, supra, at 274-276 (question
"whether there is a probability that the defendant would
commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society" is not unconstitutionally vague).
In our decisions holding a death sentence unconstitutional
because of a vague sentencing factor, the State had presented a specific proposition that the sentencer had to find
true or false (e.g., whether the crime was especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel). We have held, under certain sentencing
schemes, that a vague propositional factor used in the sentencing decision creates an unacceptable risk of randomness,
the mark of the arbitrary and capricious sentencing process

Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

prohibited by Furman v. Georgia,408 U. S.238 (1972). See
Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222 (1992). Those concerns are
mitigated when a factor does not require a yes or a no
answer to a specific question, but instead only points the
sentencer to a subject matter. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§§ 190.3(a), (k) (West 1988). Both types of factors (and the
distinction between the two is not always clear) have their
utility. For purposes of vagueness analysis, however, in examining the propositional content of a factor, our concern is
that the factor have some "common-sense core of meaning
...
that criminal juries should be capable of understanding."
Jurek, supra, at 279 (White, J., concurring in judgment).
B
With those principles in mind, we consider petitioners'
vagueness challenge to the California scheme. A defendant
in California is eligible for the death penalty when the jury
finds him guilty of first-degree murder and finds one of
the § 190.2 special circumstances true. See California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S.992, 1008 (1983) (jury found that "the defendant [fell] within the legislatively defined category of persons eligible for the death penalty [by] determining the truth
of the alleged special circumstance," commission of murder
during the course of a robbery). (Petitioners do not argue
that the special circumstances found in their cases were
insufficient, so we do not address that part of California's
scheme save to describe its relation to the selection phase.)
At the penalty phase, the jury is instructed to consider numerous other factors listed in § 190.3 in deciding whether to
impose the death penalty on a particular defendant. Petitioners contend that three of those § 190.3 sentencing factors are
unconstitutional and that, as a consequence, it was error to
instruct their juries to consider them. Both Proctor and Tuilaepa challenge factor (a), which requires the sentencer to
consider the "circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the exist-

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
Opinion of the Court

ence of any special circumstances found to be true." Tuilaepa challenges two other factors as well: factor (b), which
requires the sentencer to consider "[t]he presence or absence
of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use
or attempted use of force or violence or the express or
implied threat to use force or violence"; and factor (i),
which requires the sentencer to consider "[t]he age of the
defendant at the time of the crime." We conclude that
none of the three factors is defined in terms that violate
the Constitution.
Petitioners' challenge to factor (a) is at some odds with
settled principles, for our capital jurisprudence has established that the sentencer should consider the circumstances
of the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.
See, e.g., Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304 ("[C]onsideration of...
the circumstances of the particular offense [is] a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty
of death"). We would be hard pressed to invalidate a jury
instruction that implements what we have said the law requires. In any event, this California factor instructs the
jury to consider a relevant subject matter and does so in
understandable terms. The circumstances of the crime are
a traditional subject for consideration by the sentencer, and
an instruction to consider the circumstances is neither vague
nor otherwise improper under our Eighth Amendment
jurisprudence.
Tuilaepa also challenges factor (b), which requires the sentencer to consider the defendant's prior criminal activity.
The objection fails for many of the same reasons. Factor (b)
is phrased in conventional and understandable terms and
rests in large part on a determination whether certain
events occurred, thus asking the jury to consider matters of
historical fact. Under other sentencing schemes, in Texas
for example, jurors may be asked to make a predictive judgment, such as "whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would

Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)

.977

Opinion of the Court

constitute a continuing threat to society." See Jurek, 428
U. S., at 269. Both a backward-looking and a forwardlooking inquiry are a permissible part of the sentencing process, however, and the States have considerable latitude in
determining how to guide the sentencer's decision in this
respect. Here, factor (b) is not vague.
Tuilaepa's third challenge is to factor (i), which requires
the sentencer to consider "[t]he age of the defendant at the
time of the crime." This again is an unusual challenge in
light of our precedents. See Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455
U. S.104, 115-117 (1982) (age may be relevant factor in sentencing decision). The factual inquiry is of the most rudimentary sort, and there is no suggestion that the term "age"
is vague. Petitioner contends, however, that the age factor
is equivocal and that in the typical case the prosecution argues in favor of the death penalty based on the defendant's
age, no matter how old or young he was at the time of the
crime. It is neither surprising nor remarkable that the relevance of the defendant's age can pose a dilemma for the sentencer. But difficulty in application is not equivalent to
vagueness. Both the prosecution and the defense may present valid arguments as to the significance of the defendant's
age in a particular case. Competing arguments by adversary parties bring perspective to a problem, and thus serve
to promote a more reasoned decision, providing guidance as
to a factor jurors most likely would discuss in any event.
We find no constitutional deficiency in factor (i).
C
Petitioners could not and do not take great issue with the
conclusion that factors (a), (b), and (i) provide common and
understandable terms to the sentencer. Cf. Godfrey, 446
U. S., at 429 ("jury's interpretation of [outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman factor] can only be the subject of sheer speculation"). Petitioners argue, however, that
selection factors must meet the requirements for eligibility

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
Opinion of the Court

factors, Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-5161, pp. 10-25, and
therefore must require an answer to a factual question, as
eligibility factors do. According to petitioners, a capital
jury may not be instructed simply to consider an open-ended
subject matter, such as "the circumstances of the crime" or
"the background of the defendant." Apart from the fact
that petitioners' argument ignores the obvious utility of
these open-ended factors as part of a neutral sentencing
process, it contravenes our precedents. Our decisions in
Zant and Gregg reveal that, at the selection stage, the States
are not confined to submitting to the jury specific propositional questions. In Zant, we found no constitutional difficulty where the jury had been told to consider "'all facts
and circumstances presented in extenuation, mitigation, and
aggravation of punishment as well as such arguments as
have been presented for the State and for the Defense."'
462 U. S., at 878-880, 889, n. 25. We also stated that "[n]othing in the United States Constitution prohibits a trial judge
from instructing a jury that it would be appropriate to take
account of a defendant's prior criminal record in making its
sentencing determination." Id., at 888. And in Gregg, we
rejected a vagueness challenge to that same Georgia sentencing scheme in a case in which the "judge... charged the
jury that in determining what sentence was appropriate the
jury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if any,
presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation." 428
U. S., at 161, 203-204. In both cases, therefore, the Court
found no constitutional problem with a death sentence where
the jury instructions directed consideration of the "facts and
circumstances" of the case. In these cases as well, we must
reject petitioners' suggestion that the Constitution prohibits
sentencing instructions that require the trier of fact to consider a relevant subject matter such as the "circumstances
of the crime."
Petitioners also suggest that the § 190.3 sentencing factors

are flawed because they do not instruct the sentencer how to

Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimate
sentence. In this regard, petitioners claim that a single list
of factors is unconstitutional because it does not guide the
jury in evaluating and weighing the evidence and allows the
prosecution (as well as the defense) to make wide-ranging
arguments about whether the defendant deserves the death
penalty. This argument, too, is foreclosed by our cases. A
capital sentencer need not be instructed how to weigh any
particular fact in the capital sentencing decision. In California v. Ramos, for example, we upheld an instruction informing the jury that the Governor had the power to commute life sentences and stated that "the fact that the jury is
given no specific guidance on how the commutation factor
is to figure into its determination presents no constitutional
problem." 463 U. S., at 1008-1009, n. 22. Likewise, in
Proffitt v. Florida,we upheld the Florida capital sentencing
scheme even though "the various factors to be considered by
the sentencing authorities [did] not have numerical weights
assigned to them." 428 U. S., at 258. In Gregg, moreover,
we "approved Georgia's capital sentencing statute even
though it clearly did not channel the jury's discretion by
enunciating specific standards to guide the jury's consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances." Zant,
462 U. S., at 875. We also rejected an objection "to the wide
scope of evidence and argument" allowed at sentencing hearings. 428 U. S., at 203-204. In sum, "discretion to evaluate
and weigh the circumstances relevant to the particular defendant and the crime he committed" is not impermissible in
the capital sentencing process. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481
U. S. 279, 315, n. 37 (1987). "Once the jury finds that the
defendant falls within the legislatively defined category of
persons eligible for the death penalty,... the jury then is
free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether
death is the appropriate punishment." Ramos, supra, at
1008. Indeed, the sentencer may be given "unbridled discretion in determining whether the death penalty should be

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
SOUTER, J., concurring

imposed after it has found that the defendant is a member
of the class made eligible for that penalty." Zant, supra, at
875; see also Barclay v. Florida,463 U. S. 939, 948-951 (1983)
(plurality opinion). In contravention of those cases, petitioners' argument would force the States to adopt a kind of
mandatory sentencing scheme requiring a jury to sentence a
defendant to death if it found, for example, a certain kind or
number of facts, or found more statutory aggravating factors
than statutory mitigating factors. The States are not required to conduct the capital sentencing process in that fashion. See Gregg, supra, at 199-200, n. 50.
The instructions to the juries in petitioners' cases directing consideration of factor (a), factor (b), and factor (i) did
not violate the Constitution. The judgments of the Supreme Court of California are
Affirmed.
concurring.
It is my view that once a State has adopted a methodology
to narrow the eligibility for the death penalty, thereby ensuring that its imposition is not "freakish," Wainwright v.
Goode, 464 U. S.78, 87 (1983) (per curiam), the distinctive
procedural requirements of the Eighth Amendment have
been exhausted. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639, 669673 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). Today's decision adheres to our cases which acknowledge additional requirements, but since it restricts
their further expansion it moves in the right direction. For
that reason, and without abandoning my prior views, I join
the opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA,

concurring.
I join the Court's opinion because it correctly recognizes
that factors adequate to perform the function of genuine narrowing, as well as factors that otherwise guide the jury in
selecting which defendants receive the death penalty, are not

susceptible to mathematical precision; they must depend for
their requisite clarity on embodying a "common-sense core
of meaning," as Justice White put it in Jurek v. Texas, 428
U. S. 262, 279 (1976) (concurring opinion). Taking factor (b)
to be essentially propositional, as the Court uses the term,

and I agree with the Court's analysis of factor (i) and the
challenged portion of factor (a), neither of which is framed
as a proposition.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
concurring in the judgment.
As these cases come to us they present a question that the
Court answered in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983).
California, like Georgia, has provided a procedure for determining whether a defendant found guilty of murder is eligible for the death penalty. Petitioners have not challenged
the constitutionality of that procedure or its application in
these cases. Accordingly, our decision rests on the same assumption that we made in Zant, namely, that the statutory
procedure for determining eligibility adequately confines the
class of persons eligible for the death penalty to a narrow
category in which there is a special justification for "the
imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant
compared to others found guilty of murder." Id., at 877.
The question is whether, in addition to adequately narrowing the class of death-eligible defendants, the State must
channel the jury's sentencing discretion when it is deciding
whether to impose the death sentence on an eligible defendant by requiring the trial judge to characterize relevant sentencing factors as aggravating or mitigating. In Zant we
held that the incorrect characterization of a relevant factor
as an aggravating factor did not prejudice the defendant; it
follows, I believe, that the failure to characterize factors such
as the age of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime
as either aggravating or mitigating is also unobjectionable.

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
STEVENS, J.,

concurring in judgment

Indeed, I am persuaded that references to such potentially
ambiguous, but clearly relevant, factors actually reduces the
risk of arbitrary capital sentencing.
Prior to the Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408
U. S. 238 (1972), in a number of States the death penalty was
authorized not only for all first-degree murders, but for less
serious offenses such as rape, armed robbery, and kidnaping
as well. Moreover, juries had virtually unbridled discretion
in determining whether a human life should be taken or
spared. The risk of arbitrary and capricious sentencing,
specifically including the danger that racial prejudice would
determine the fate of the defendant,* persuaded a majority of the Court in Furman that such capital sentencing
schemes were unconstitutional. The two principal protections against such arbitrary sentencing that have been endorsed in our subsequent jurisprudence focus, respectively,
on the eligibility determination and the actual sentencing
decision.
First, as CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST writing for the Court
in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), succinctly
stated: "To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing
scheme must 'genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible
for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to
others found guilty of murder."' Id., at 244 (quoting Zant
v. Stephens, 462 U. S., at 877). When only a narrow subclass
of murderers can be subjected to the death penalty, the risk
of cruel and unusual punishment-either because it is disproportionate to the severity of the offense or because its imposition may be influenced by unacceptable factors-is diminished. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 367 (1987)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting). Because those risks can never be
entirely eliminated, however, the Court has identified an ad*See Justice Douglas' concurring opinion, 408 U. S., at 249-251.

STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

ditional safeguard to protect death-eligible defendants from
the arbitrary imposition of the extreme penalty.
In Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 602-605 (1978), Chief Justice Burger emphasized the importance of requiring the jury
to make an individualized determination on the basis of the
character of the individual and the circumstances of the
crime. Insisting that the jury have an opportunity to consider all evidence relevant to a fair sentencing decision reduces the danger that they might otherwise rely on an irrelevant and improper consideration such as the race of the
defendant. In Zant, even though the trial judge had incorrectly characterized the defendant's prior history of "assaultive offenses" as a statutory aggravating circumstance, we
found no constitutional error because the evidence supporting that characterization was relevant and admissible. 462
U. S., at 887-889. We made it clear, however, that it would
be error for a State to attach the "aggravating" label to, or
otherwise authorize the jury to draw adverse inferences
from, "factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, such as for example the race, religion, or political affiliation of the defendant."
Id., at 885.
The three penalty-phase factors in California's statute that
are challenged in these cases do not violate that command.
Matters such as the age of the defendant at the time of the
crime, the circumstances' of the crime, and the presence or
absence of force or violence are, in my opinion, relevant to
an informed, individualized sentencing decision. Under
Lockett, the defendant has a right to have the sentencer consider favorable evidence on each of these subjects, and under
Zant it is permissible for the prosecutor to adduce unfavorable evidence on the same subjects. If, as we held in Zant,
it is not constitutional error for the trial judge to place an
incorrect label on the prosecutor's evidence, it necessarily
follows that refusing to characterize ambiguous evidence as

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

mitigating or aggravating is also constitutionally permissible. Indeed, as I have indicated, I think the identification of
additional factors that are relevant to the sentencing decision
reduces the danger that a juror may vote in favor of the
death penalty because he or she harbors a prejudice against
a class of which the defendant is a member.
Accordingly, given the assumption (unchallenged by these
petitioners) that California has a statutory "scheme" that
complies with the narrowing requirement defined in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S., at 244, I conclude that the sentencing factors at issue in these cases are consistent with the
defendant's constitutional entitlement to an individualized
"determination that death is the appropriate punishment in
a specific case." Woodson v. North Carolina,428 U. S. 280,
305 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).
JUSTICE BLACKMUN,

dissenting.

Adhering to my view that the death penalty cannot be
imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution, see
Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141,1143 (1994), I would vacate
petitioners' death sentences. Even if I did not hold this
view, I would find that the three challenged factors do not
withstand a meaningful vagueness analysis because "as a
practical matter [they] fail to guide the sentencer's discretion." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 235 (1992).
I
A
The California capital punishment scheme does more than
simply direct the sentencing jurors' attention to certain subject matters. It lists 11 factors and authorizes the jury to
treat any of them as aggravating circumstances to be placed
on death's side of the scale. Jurors are instructed that they
"shall impose a death sentence if [they] conclud[e] that the
aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances." Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988). De-

spite the critical-even decisive-role these factors play in
the determination of who actually receives the death penalty,
jurors are given no guidance in how to consider them. We
have stated: "A vague aggravating factor used in the weighing process ... creates the risk that the jury will treat the
defendant as more deserving of the death penalty than he
might otherwise be by relying upon the existence of an illusory circumstance," Stringer, 503 U.S., at 235.
The majority introduces a novel distinction between
"propositional" and "nonpropositional" aggravating circumstances. Ante, at 974. The majority acknowledges that the
"distinction between the two is not always clear," ante, at
975; I find it largely illusory. The Court suggests, but does
not make explicit, that propositional factors are those that
"require a yes or a no answer to a specific question," while
nonpropositional factors are those that "only poin[t] the sentencer to a subject matter." Ibid. Presumably, then, asking the jury whether "the murder was especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel" would be a propositional aggravator,
while directing the sentencer to "the presence or absence
of any especial heinousness, atrocity, or cruelty" would be a
nonpropositional factor. I am at a loss to see how the mere
rephrasing does anything more to channel or guide jury discretion. Nor does this propositional/nonpropositional distinction appear to play any role in the Court's decision. The
Court nowhere discloses specifically where the line is drawn,
on which side of it the three challenged factors fall, and what
relevance, if any, this distinction should have to the Court's
future vagueness analysis.'
INor does it matter for Eighth Amendment purposes that California
uses one set of factors (the § 190.2 "special circumstances") to determine
eligibility and another set (the § 190.3 "relevant factors") in the weighing
or selection process. Whether an aggravator is used for narrowing, or
for weighing, or for both, it cannot be impermissibly vague. See Arave
v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463 (1993) (vagueness analysis applied to aggravating
factor, even though remaining aggravating factor made defendant death

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
BLACKMUN,

J., dissenting

The more relevant distinction is not how an aggravating
factor is presented, but what the sentencer is told to do with
it. Where, as in Georgia, "aggravating factors as such have
no specific function in the jury's decision whether a defendant who has been found to be eligible for the death penalty
should receive it under all the circumstances of the case,"
Stringer, 503 U. S., at 229-230, we have not subjected aggravating circumstances to a vagueness analysis. See Zant v.
Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 873-874 (1983). In California, by
contrast, where the sentencer is instructed to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, a vague aggravator

creates the risk of an arbitrary thumb on death's side of the
scale, so we analyze aggravators for clarity, objectivity, and
principled guidance. See Maynard v. Cartwright,486 U. S.
356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980); see also
Pensinger v. California, 502 U. S. 930, 931 (1991) (O'CoNNOR, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (observing that
California, like Mississippi, "requires its juries to weigh
aggravating and mitigating circumstances"); Stringer, 503
U. S., at 231 (difference between "nonweighing" States like
Georgia and "weighing" States like California is "not one of
'semantics'") (citation omitted).
Each of the challenged California factors "leave[s] the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor." Espinosa v. Florida, 505
U. S. 1079, 1081 (1992). Each of the three-circumstances
of the crime, age, and prior criminal activity-has been
exploited to convince jurors that just about anything is
aggravating.
Prosecutors have argued, and jurors are free to find, that
"circumstances of the crime" constitutes an aggravating factor because the defendant killed the victim for some purporteligible); Sochor v. Florida,504 U. S. 527 (1992) (same); Walton v. Arizona,
497 U. S. 639 (1990) (same). The Court recognizes as much by subjecting
the challenged factors to a vagueness analysis.

endure the terror of anticipating a violent death,8 or because

prosecutors have argued, and juries are free to find, that the
age of the victim was an aggravating circumstance because
the victim was a child, an adolescent, a young adult, in the
prime of life, or elderly; 12 or that the method of killing was
aggravating, because the victim was strangled, bludgeoned,
shot, stabbed, or consumed by fire; 13 or that the location of

the killing was an aggravating factor, because the victim was
killed in her own home, in a public bar, in a city park, or in
a remote location. 14 In short, because neither the California
Legislature nor the California courts ever have articulated
a limiting construction of this term, prosecutors have been
permitted to use the "circumstances of the crime" as an aggravating factor to embrace the entire spectrum of facts
present in virtually every homicide-something this Court
condemned in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980). See
Maynard v. Cartwright,486 U. S., at 363 (the Court "plainly
rejected the submission that a particular set of facts surrounding a murder, however shocking they might be, were
enough in themselves, and without some narrowing principle
to apply to those facts, to warrant the imposition of the
death penalty").15
The defendant's age as a factor, applied inconsistently and
erratically, similarly fails to channel the jurors' discretion.
In practice, prosecutors and trial judges have applied this
factor to defendants of virtually every age: in their teens,
twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties at the time of the

of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis
for a sentence less than death," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)
(emphasis in original), we have never approved such unrestricted consideration of a circumstance in aggravation. Similarly, while we approved the
Georgia capital sentencing scheme, which permits jurors to consider all
the circumstances of the offense and the offender, we did so in the context
of a system in which aggravators performed no function beyond the eligibility decision. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 873-874 (1983).

crime. 16 Far from applying any narrowing construction, the
California Supreme Court has described age as a "metonym
for any age-related matter suggested by the evidence or by
common experience or morality that might reasonably inform the choice of penalty." People v. Lucky, 45 Cal. 3d 259,
302, 753 P. 2d 1052, 1080 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1034
(1989).
Nor do jurors find meaningful guidance from "the presence
or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence." Although the California Supreme Court has held that "criminal" is "limited to conduct that violates a penal statute,"
People v. Wright, 52 Cal. 3d 367,425, 802 P. 2d 221,259 (1990)
(emphasis in original), and that "force or violence" excludes
violence to property, People v. Boyd, 38 Cal. 3d 762, 700 P.
2d 782 (1985), that court has not required such an instruction,
and petitioner Tuilaepa's jurors were not so instructed.
This left the prosecution free to introduce evidence of "trivial incidents of misconduct and ill temper," id., at 774, 700 P.

that basis.

PRLACRMUN, J., dissenting

No less a danger is that jurors-or even judges-will treat
the mere absence of a mitigator as an aggravator, transforming a neutral or factually irrelevant factor into an illusory
aggravator.18 Although the California Supreme Court has
ruled that certain of the factors can serve only as mitigators,19 it has not required that the jury be so instructed.
See, e. g., People v. Raley, 2 Cal. 4th 870, 919, 830 P. 2d 712,
744-745 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U. S. 945 (1993). Nor has
that court restricted jury instructions to those aggravating
So. 2d 1126, 1129-1130 (La. 1985) (invalidating aggravating circumstance
of "significant" history of criminal conduct).
18Judges, as well as juries, have fallen into this trap. See, e. g., People
v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 717, 802 P. 2d 278, 316 (1990) (trial judge concluded that factor (h), dealing with a defendant's impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his actions, was an aggravating factor because
defendant did not have diminished capacity or other impairment), cert.
denied, 502 U. S. 837 (1991); People v. Hamilton, 48 Cal. 3d 1142, 1186,
774 P. 2d 730, 757 (1989) (trial court concluded that 10 of 11 factors were
aggravating, including factors (d)-(h) and (j)), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1039
(1990).
19The factors that can serve only as mitigators are:
"(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.
"(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal act or consented to the homicidal act.
"(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances
which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or
extenuation for his conduct.
"(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under
the substantial domination of another person.
"(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease
and defect, or the [e]ffects of intoxication.
"(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.

factors that are factually relevant to the case. 20 Clearly,
some of the mitigating circumstances are so unusual that
treating their absence as an aggravating circumstance would
make them applicable to virtually all murderers. See People v. Davenport,41 Cal. 3d 247, 289, 710 P. 2d 861, 888 (1985)
(most murder cases present the absence of the mitigating
circumstances of moral justification and victim participation).
An aggravating factor that exists in nearly every capital case
fails to fulfill its purpose of guiding the jury in distinguishing
"those who deserve capital punishment from those who do
not." Arave v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993). Moreover,
a process creating the risk that the absence of mitigation
will count as aggravation artificially inflates the number of
aggravating factors the jury weighs, "creat[ing] the possibility not only of randomness but also of bias in favor of...
death." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S., at 236.
In short, open-ended factors and a lack of guidance to regularize the jurors' application of these factors create a system in which, as a practical matter, improper arguments can
be made in the courtroom and credited in the jury room. I
am at a loss to see how these challenged factors furnish the
"'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the
process for imposing a sentence of death."' Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 651 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part

exercised on the basis of constitutionally impermissible considerations-primary among them, race. Racial prejudice is
"the paradigmatic capricious and irrational sentencing factor." Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 484 (1993) (THOMAS,
J., concurring). In part to diminish the danger that a sentencer will "attac[h] the 'aggravating' label to factors that
are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to
the sentencing process," Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S., at 885,
this Court has required that a sentencer's discretion be
curbed and informed by "clear and objective standards,"
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 198 (1976) (joint opinion
of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Because the "circumstances of the crime" factor lacks clarity and objectivity, it poses an unacceptable risk that a sentencer will succumb to either overt or subtle racial impulses
or appeals. This risk is not merely theoretical. For far too
many jurors, the most important "circumstances of the
crime" are the race of the victim or the defendant. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S.279, 320 (1987) (Brennan, J., dissenting); see also General Accounting Office, Report to Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary, Death Penalty
Sentencing: Research Indicates Pattern of Racial Disparities
(Feb. 1990) (surveying and synthesizing studies and finding
a "remarkably consistent" conclusion that the race of the victim influenced the likelihood of being charged with capital
murder or receiving the death penalty in 82% of cases), reprinted at 136 Cong. Rec. 12267-12268 (1990).
The California capital sentencing scheme does little to
minimize this risk. The "circumstances of the crime" factor
may be weighed in aggravation in addition to the applicable special circumstances. Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.3(a)
(West 1988) (the trier of fact shall take into account "[t]he
circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any
special circumstances found to be true") (emphasis added).

BLACKMUN, J.,

The special circumstances themselves encompass many of
the factors generally recognized as aggravating, including
multiple-murder convictions; commission of the murder in relation to another felony; the "especially heinous, atrocious, or
cruel" nature of the murder; and the relevant identity of the
victim (as a law enforcement officer, a witness to a crime, a
judge, a prosecutor, or a public official). The statute, therefore, invites the jurors to speculate about, and give aggravating weight to, unspecified circumstances apart from these.
Nor has the California, Supreme Court attempted to limit
or guide this ranging inquiry. Far from it. That court has
concluded that the "circumstances of the crime" factor extends beyond "merely the immediate temporal and spatial
circumstances of the crime," People v. Edwards, 54 Cal. 3d
787, 833, 819 P. 2d 436, 465 (1991), and leaves "the sentencer
free to evaluate the evidence in accordance with his or her
own subjective values," People v. Tuilaepa, 4 Cal. 4th 569,
595, 842 P. 2d 1142, 1158 (1992) (case below). The court has
even warned that it has not yet "explore[d] the outer reaches
of the evidence admissible as a circumstance of the crime."
People v. Edwards, 54 Cal. 3d, at 835, 819 P. 2d, at 467.
Thus, the "unique opportunity for racial prejudice to operate
but remain undetected," Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 35
(1986), exists unchecked in the California capital sentencing
scheme. This does not instill confidence in the jury's decision to impose the death penalty on petitioner Tuilaepa, who
is Samoan, and whose victim was white.
II
Although the Court today rejects a well-founded facial
challenge to 3 of the 11 factors that permit California jurors
to select from among capital defendants those who will re-

ceive the death penalty, it has not given the California system a clean bill of health. Its unwillingness to conclude that
these factors are valid on their face leaves the door open to
a challenge to the application of one of these factors in such

a way that the risk of arbitrariness is realized. 21 The cases
before us, for example, do not clearly present a situation
in which the absence of a mitigator was treated as an
aggravator.
Additionally, the Court's opinion says nothing about the
constitutional adequacy of California's eligibility process,
which subjects a defendant to the death penalty if he is convicted of first-degree murder and the jury finds the existence
of one "special circumstance." 22 By creating nearly 20 such
special circumstances, California creates an extraordinarily
large death pool. Because petitioners mount no challenge
to these circumstances, the Court is not called on to determine -that they collectively perform sufficient, meaningful
narrowing. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983).
Of particular significance, the Court's consideration of a
small slice of one component of the California scheme says
nothing about the interaction of the various componentsthe statutory definition of first-degree murder, the special
circumstances, the relevant factors, the statutorily required
weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the
availability of judicial review, but not appellate proportionality review-and whether their end result satisfies the Eighth
Amendment's commands. The Court's treatment today of
the relevant factors as "selection factors" alone rests on the
21Such a challenge would require something more than merely pointing

to others who committed similar offenses and did not receive the death
penalty, Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764 (1990), but it is not hard to imagine
more pronounced erratic outcomes.
2The special circumstances include premeditated and deliberate murder; felony murder based on nine felonies; the infliction of torture; that the
murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; that the victim was
killed because of his race, religion, or ethnic origin; and the identity of the

victim, including that he was a peace officer, a federal law enforcement
officer, a firefighter, a witness to a crime, a prosecutor or assistant prosecutor, a former or current local, state, or federal judge, or an elected or
appointed local, state, or federal official. Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.2

(West 1988).

assumption, not tested, that the special circumstances perform all of the constitutionally required narrowing for eligibility. Should that assumption prove false, it would further
undermine the Court's approval today of these relevant
factors.
Similarly, in Pulley v. Harris,465 U. S. 37, 51 (1984), the
Court's conclusion that the California capital sentencing
scheme was not "so lacking in other checks on arbitrariness
that it would not pass constitutional muster without comparative proportionality review" was based in part on an understanding that the application of the relevant factors "'provide[s] jury guidance and lessen[s] the chance of arbitrary
application of the death penalty,"' thereby "'guarantee[ing]
that the jury's discretion will be guided and its consideration
deliberate."' Id., at 53, quoting Harrisv. Pulley, 692 F. 2d
1189, 1194, 1195 (CA9 1982). As litigation exposes the failure of these factors to guide the jury in making principled
distinctions, the Court will be well advised to reevaluate its
decision in Pulley v. Harris.
In summary, the Court isolates one part of a complex
scheme and says that, assuming that all the other parts are
doing their job, this one passes muster. But the crucial
question, and one the Court will need to face, is how the
parts are working together to determine with rationality and
fairness who is exposed to the death penalty and who receives it.
III
For two decades now, the Court has professed a commitment to guiding sentencers' discretion so as to "minimize the
risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action," Gregg v.
Georgia, 428 U. S., at 189 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,
and STEVENS, JJ.), and to achieve principled distinctions between those who receive the death penalty and those who do
not, see, e. g., Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992);
Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990); Maynard v. Cart-

wright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988). The Court's approval today of
these California relevant factors calls into question the continued strength of that commitment. I respectfully dissent.
