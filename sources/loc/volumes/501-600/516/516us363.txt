OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Per Curiam

JONES v. ABC-TV ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 95-7186. Decided February 26, 1996
When this Court first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner Jones informa
pauperis status in October 1992, he had filed over 25 petitions in the
Court, all of which were patently frivolous and had been denied without
recorded dissent. Since then, this Court has invoked Rule 39.8 five
times to deny him informa pauperis status.
Held For the reasons discussed in Martin v. Districtof Columbia Court
of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, Jones is denied leave to proceed informa pauperis in the instant case, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any
further petitions for certiorari from him in noncriminal matters unless
he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. This order will not prevent Jones
from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed
against him, but it will allow this Court to devote its limited resources
to the claims of petitioners who have not abused the certiorari process.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Sylvester Jones requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We
deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Jones is allowed
until March 18, 1996, within which to pay the docketing fee
required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not
to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Jones in
noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance
with Rule 33.1.
Jones has abused this Court's certiorari process. In October 1992, we first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Jones informa
pauperis status in two petitions for certiorari. See Jones v.
Wright, 506 U. S. 810; In re Jones, 506 U. S. 810. At that
time, Jones had filed over 25 petitions in this Court, all of
which were patently frivolous and had been denied without

recorded dissent. And since October 1992, we have invoked
Rule 39.8 five times to deny Jones informa pauperisstatus.
See Jones v. Schulze, 513 U. S. 805 (1994); In re Jones, 510
U. S. 963 (1993); Jones v. Jackson, 510 U. S. 808 (1993); Jones
v. Suter, 508 U. S. 949 (1993); Jones v. Jackson, 506 U. S. 1047
(1993). Currently, Jones has at least two more petitions for
certiorari pending.
We enter the order barring prospective fings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). Jones' abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases and so we limit our
sanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Jones from
petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be
imposed against him. The order will, however, allow this
Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or
decision of this motion.

dissenting.
For the reasons I have previously expressed, I respectfully
dissent. See Attwood v. Singletary, ante, p. 298 (STEVENS,
J., dissenting); Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Zatko v.
California,502 U. S. 16, 18 (1991) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
