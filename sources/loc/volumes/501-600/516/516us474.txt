OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Per Curiam

DALTON, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF
HUMAN SERVICES ET AL. v. LITTLE ROCK
FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 95-1025.

Decided March 18, 1996

Respondents, Medicaid providers and physicians who perform abortions
in Arkansas, filed this suit against petitioner state officials, claiming that
Amendment 68 of the State Constitution, §1 of which prohibits using
state funds to pay for any abortion except one to save the mother's life,
conflicts with a requirement in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as
amended by the 1994 version of the "Hyde Amendment," that States
fund abortions where the pregnancy resulted from an act of rape or
incest. The District Court, inter alia, enjoined enforcement of the
amendment in its entirety for so long as the State accepts federal Medicaid funds. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.
Held. Amendment 68 can be enjoined only to the extent that it imposes
obligations inconsistent with Title XIX. In a pre-emption case such as
this, state law is displaced only to the extent that it actually conflicts
with federal law. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 204. Because
Amendment 68 was challenged only insofar as it conflicted with Title
XIX, it was improper to enjoin its application to funding that does not
involve the Medicaid program. The injunction is overbroad in its temporal scope as well. The Hyde Amendment is not permanent legislation; it was enacted as part of the appropriation of funds for certain
Executive Departments for one fiscal year. Its history-before 1994, it
limited federal funding to those abortions necessary to save the mother's life-identifies the possibility that a different version may be
enacted in the future. Thus, it was improper for the District Court to
enjoin Amendment 68's enforcement for so long as the State accepted
federal Medicaid funds.
PER CURIAM.

Respondents in this case are Medicaid providers and physicians who perform abortions in the State of Arkansas. In

November 1993, they filed suit against petitioners, who are
Arkansas state officials, seeking injunctive and declaratory

relief with respect to Amendment 68 of the Arkansas Constitution, § 1 of which prohibits the use of state funds to pay
for any abortion "except to save the mother's life." Their
claim was that this provision is inconsistent with a requirement in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 343, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1396 et seq., as affected by the 1994
version of the "Hyde Amendment," that States fund medically necessary abortions where the pregnancy resulted from
an act of rape or incest.' The United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted summary judgment for respondents and enjoined Amendment 68; the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 60 F. 3d 497 (1995). Petitioners sought certiorari
with respect to two aspects of the case: (1) the District
Court's holding that "[u]nder the Hyde Amendment... federal law requires Arkansas and other states that participate
in the federal Medicaid program to pay for abortions in cases
where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, as well as
abortions to save the mother's life," 860 F. Supp. 609, 612
(1994), and (2) the District Court's enjoining of Amendment
68 "in its entirety for so long as the State of Arkansas accepts federal funds pursuant to the Medicaid Act," id., at
628 (emphasis added).2 We grant certiorari as to the second
1

The 1994 Hyde Amendment, so named for its sponsor, Representative
Henry Hyde of Illinois, was enacted as § 509 of the Department of Labor
Appropriations Act, 1994, 107 Stat. 1082. Section 509 directs that "[n]one
of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended for any abortion except when it is made known to the Federal entity or official to which
funds are appropriated under this Act that such procedure is necessary to
save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of an act of
rape or incest." 107 Stat. 1113. The provision was reenacted unchanged
for2 fiscal year 1995. See 108 Stat. 2539.
Any uncertainty as to the scope of the District Court's injunction was
erased by a subsequent order denying petitioners' motion for stay of judgment. The order declares that "Amendment 68 to the Arkansas Constitution directly conflicts with federal law (the 1994 Hyde Amendment) and
is, therefore, null, void and of no effect." App. to Pet. for Cert. D-2. A
footnote to this sentence states: "The Court apologizes for the redundancy,

of these questions. Accepting (without deciding) that the
District Court's interpretation of the Hyde Amendment is
correct, we reverse the decision below insofar as it affirms
blanket invalidation of Amendment 68.
In a pre-emption case such as this, state law is displaced
only "to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law."
Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 204 (1983).
See, e. g., Gade v. National Solid Wastes Manageement Assn.,
505 U. S. 88, 109 (1992); Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, 475 U. S.355,
376 (1986). "[Tlhe rule [is] that a federal court should not
extend its invalidation of a statute further than necessary to

dispose of the case before it." Brockett v. Spokane Arcades,
Inc., 472 U. S.491, 502 (1985).
Amendment 68 reads as follows:
Public funding. No public. funds will be used to
"1.
pay for any abortion, except to save the mother's life.
Public policy. The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception
until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal
Constitution.
" 3. Effect of amendment. This amendment will not
affect contraceptives or require an appropriation of
public funds."
" 2.

Section 1 of this provision is affected by the lower courts'
interpretation of Title XIX and the 1994 Hyde Amendment
only in cases where a Medicaid-eligible woman seeks to abort
a pregnancy resulting from an act of rape or incest and the
abortion is not necessary to save the woman's life. Respondents do not claim that any other possible application of
§ 1 is pre-empted by current federal law. It is entirely possible, for example, that §1 would have application to state programs that receive no federal funding. As the District
but, apparently the Court's 35-page order rendered Monday, last, did not
make this point clear." Ibid.

Court noted, the Arkansas Crime Victims Reparations Act,
Ark. Code Ann. § 16-90-701 et seq. (Supp. 1995), established
a program which provides compensation and assistance to
victims of criminal acts within the State, including compensation for medical expenses, see § 16-90-703(7). Without
the limitation imposed by Amendment 68, the program
might have the authority to reimburse crime victims for
abortions not necessary to save the life of the pregnant
woman. Assuming the compensation program is entirely
state funded, nothing in respondents' challenge to Amendment 68 suggests that the application of § 1 to the program
would conflict with any federal statute. Because Amendment 68 was challenged only insofar as it conflicted with
Title XIX, it was improper to enjoin its application to funding that does not involve the Medicaid program.
The District Court's injunction is overbroad in its temporal scope as well. The Hyde Amendment is not permanent
legislation; it was enacted as part of the statute appropriating funds for certain Executive Departments for one fiscal
year. While the versions of the Hyde Amendment applicable to the 1994 and 1995 fiscal years authorized the use of
federal funds to pay for an abortion after notice that "such
procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother or that
the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest," the
version of the amendment applicable to prior years limited
federal funding to those abortions necessary to save the life
of the mother. See, e. g., §203, Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 1993, 106 Stat. 1811. Because this history
identifies the possibility that a different version of the Hyde
Amendment may be enacted in the future, it was improper
for the District Court to enjoin enforcement of Amendment
68 "for so long as the State of Arkansas accepts federal funds
pursuant to the Medicaid Act." 860 F. Supp., at 628. See
Planned ParenthoodAffiliates of Michigan v. Engler,73 F.
3d 634, 641 (CA6 1996) (modifying injunction in similar case
to "tak[e] into account the changeable nature of spending

478 DALTON v. LITTLE ROCK FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES

bills in general, and the Hyde Amendment in particular,
which in some years are very restrictive and in other years
are less so").
The District Court's invalidation of §§2 and 3 of the
amendment was based on the proposition that these sections
"have no function independent of" § 1. 860 F. Supp., at 626.
Even assuming that to be true, once § 1 is left with the substantial application that the Supremacy Clause fully allows,
§§ 2 and 3 subsist as well.
We therefore reverse the decision of the Eighth Circuit
insofar as it affirms the scope of the injunction, and remand
for entry of an order enjoining the enforcement of Amendment 68 only to the extent that the amendment imposes obligations inconsistent with federal law.
It is so ordered.
