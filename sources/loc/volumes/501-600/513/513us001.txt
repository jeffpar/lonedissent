AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1994

IN RE WHITAKER
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 93-9220.

Decided October 11, 1994

Since 1987, pro se petitioner Whitaker has filed 23 claims for relief, all of
which have been denied without recorded dissent. He has also been
denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis, pursuant to this Court's
Rule 39.8, for the last two petitions in which he has sought extraordinary relief
Held- Whitaker is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperie in the instant case, and the Clerk is instructed not to accept any further petitions
for extraordinary writs from him in noncriminal matters unless he pays
the required docketing fee and submits his petitions in compliance with
Rule 33. In order to prevent frivolous petitions for extraordinary relief
from unsettling the fair administration of justice, this Court has a duty
to deny in forma pauperis status to those individuals who have abused
the system. In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177, 179-180.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Fred Whitaker filed a petition for writ
of mandamus and requests permission to proceed in forma
pauperisunder this Court's Rule 39. Pursuant to Rule 39.8,

IN RE WHITAKER
Per Curiam

we deny petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis.*
Petitioner is allowed until November 1, 1994, within which
to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and to submit
a petition for a writ of prohibition in compliance with Rule
33 of the Rules of this Court. For the reasons explained
below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept
any further petitions for extraordinary writs from petitioner
in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submits his petition in compliance
with Rule 33.
Since 1987, petitioner has filed 23 claims for relief, including 18 petitions for certiorari, 9 of which have been filed in
the last three Terms. That total also includes five petitions
for extraordinary writs filed since June 1992. We have denied all of the petitions without recorded dissent. We have
also denied petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis
pursuant to Rule 39.8 for the last two petitions in which he
has sought extraordinary relief. In re Whitaker, 511 U. S.
1105 (1994); In re Whitaker, 506 U. S. 983 (1992).
Petitioner's current claim involves a civil action brought
in the Alameda, California, Superior Court against Lake
Merritt Lodge & Residence, alleging damages of $2 in illegal
taxes. His legal arguments here are just as frivolous as
those he has made in previous petitions.
Although petitioner has exhibited frequent filing patterns
with respect to petitions for writ of certiorari, we limit our
sanctions at this time to the type of relief requested todaystyled as petitions for extraordinary writs. We have imposed similar sanctions in the past. See, e. g., In re Anderson, 511 U. S. 364 (1994); In re Demos, 500 U. S. 16 (1991); In
*Rule 39.8 provides: "If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari,
jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ, as the case
may be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leave
to proceed in forma pauperis."

re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991); In re McDonald, 489 U. S.
180 (1989). As we concluded in Sindram:
"The goal of fairly dispensing justice... is compromised
when the Court is forced to devote its limited resources
to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests.
Pro se petitioners have a greater capacity than most to
disrupt the fair allocation of judicial resources because
they are not subject to the financial considerations-filing fees and attorney's fees-that deter other litigants
from filing frivolous petitions. The risks of abuse are
particularly acute with respect to applications for extraordinary relief, since such petitions are not subject to
any time limitations and, theoretically, could be filed at
any time without limitation. In order to prevent frivolous petitions for extraordinary relief from unsettling
the fair administration of justice, the Court has a duty
to deny in forma pauperis status to those individuals
who have abused the system." 498 U. S., at 179-180

dissenting.
Having already explained why the 1991 amendment to this
Court's Rule 39 was both unnecessary and ill considered,'
and having dissented from each of the dispositions cited by
the Court today,2 I would only add that I remain convinced
that the views expressed in those dissents are correct.
Given the current state of our docket, there is a peculiar
irony in the Court's reliance, as a basis for singling out this
