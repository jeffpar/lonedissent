and 43.
[See infra, p. 1283.]

AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES
OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

Rule 5. Service andfiling of pleadings and other papers.
(e) Filing with the court defined.-The filing of papers
with the court as required by these rules shall be made by
filing them with the clerk of court, except that the judge may
permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which event
the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith
transmit them to the office of the clerk. A court may by
local rule permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by
electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States
establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance
with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose
of applying these rules. The clerk shall not refuse to accept
for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because
it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules
or any local rules or practices.
Rule 43. Taking of testimony.
(a) Form.-In every trial, the testimony of witnesses shall
be taken in open court, unless a federal law, these rules, the
Federal Rules of Evidence, or other rules adopted by the
Supreme Court provide otherwise. The court may, for good
cause shown in compelling circumstances and upon appropriate safeguards, permit presentation of testimony in open
court by contemporaneous transmission from a different
location.
