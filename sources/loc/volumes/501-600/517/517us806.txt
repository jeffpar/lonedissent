WHREN ET AL. v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 95-5841. Argued April 17, 1996-Decided June 10, 1996
Plainclothes policemen patrolling a "high drug area" in an unmarked vehicle observed a truck driven by petitioner Brown waiting at a stop sign
at an intersection for an unusually long time; the truck then turned
suddenly, without signaling, and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed.
The officers stopped the vehicle, assertedly to warn the driver about
traffic violations, and upon approaching the truck observed plastic bags
of crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's hands. Petitioners were arrested. Prior to trial on federal drug charges, they moved for suppression of the evidence, arguing that the stop had not been justified by
either a reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe petitioners
were engaged in illegal drug-dealing activity, and that the officers'
traffic-violation ground for approaching the truck was pretextual. The
motion to suppress was denied, petitioners were convicted, and the
Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: The temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws does not violate the Fourth
Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if a reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective. Pp. 809-819.
(a) Detention of a motorist is reasonable where probable cause exists
to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. See, e. g., Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 659. Petitioners claim that, because the police
may be tempted to use commonly occurring traffic violations as means
of investigating violations of other laws, the Fourth Amendment test
for traffic stops should be whether a reasonable officer would have
stopped the car for the purpose of enforcing the traffic violation at issue.
However, this Court's cases foreclose the argument that ulterior motives
can invalidate police conduct justified on the basis of probable cause.
See, e. g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 221, n. 1, 236. Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth
Amendment analysis. Pp. 809-813.
(b) Although framed as an empirical question-whether the officer's
conduct deviated materially from standard police practices-petitioners'
proposed test is plainly designed to combat the perceived danger of
pretextual stops. It is thus inconsistent with this Court's cases, which

Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Syllabus
make clear that the Fourth Amendment's concern with "reasonableness"
allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances, whatever
the subjective intent. See, e. g., Robinson, supra, at 236. Nor can the
Fourth Amendment's protections be thought to vary from place to place
and from time to time, which would be the consequence of assessing
the reasonableness of police conduct in light of local law enforcement
practices. Pp. 813-816.
(c) Also rejected is petitioners' argument that the balancing of interests inherent in Fourth Amendment inquiries does not support enforcement of minor traffic laws by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles,
since that practice only minimally advances the government's interest
in traffic safety while subjecting motorists to inconvenience, confusion,
and anxiety. Where probable cause exists, this Court has found it necessary to engage in balancing only in cases involving searches or seizures conducted in a manner unusually harmful to the individual. See,
e. g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1. The making of a traffic stop
out of uniform does not remotely qualify as such an extreme practice.
Pp. 816-819.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we decide whether the temporary detention
of a motorist who the police have probable cause to believe
has committed a civil traffic violation is inconsistent with the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer would have been motivated
to stop the car by a desire to enforce the traffic laws.
JUSTICE SCALIA

I
On the evening of June 10, 1993, plainclothes vice-squad
officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department were patrolling a "high drug area" of the city in
an unmarked car. Their suspicions were aroused when they
passed a dark Pathfinder truck with temporary license plates
and youthful occupants waiting at a stop sign, the driver
looking down into the lap of the passenger at his right. The
truck remained stopped at the intersection for what seemed
an unusually long time-more than 20 seconds. When the
police car executed a U-turn in order to head back toward
the truck, the Pathfinder turned suddenly to its right, without signaling, and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed. The
policemen followed, and in a short while overtook the Pathfinder when it stopped behind other traffic at a red light.
They pulled up alongside, and Officer Ephraim Soto stepped
out and approached the driver's door, identifying himself as
a police officer and directing the driver, petitioner Brown, to
put the vehicle in park. When Soto drew up to the driver's
Thomas J Miller of Iowa, CarlaJ Stovall of Kansas, J Joseph Curran,
Jr., of Maryland, Mike Moore of Mississippi, Frankie Sue Del Papa of
Nevada, Deborah T Poritz of New Jersey, Dennis C. Vacco of New York,
Michael F Easley of North Carolina, Betty D. Montgomery of Ohio, W. A.
Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Charles W. Burson of Tennessee, and Jan
Graham of Utah.

Opinion of the Court

window, he immediately observed two large plastic bags of
what appeared to be crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's
hands. Petitioners were arrested, and quantities of several
types of illegal drugs were retrieved from the vehicle.
Petitioners were charged in a four-count indictment with
violating various federal drug laws, including 21 U. S. C.
§§ 844(a) and 860(a). At a pretrial suppression hearing, they
challenged the legality of the stop and the resulting seizure
of the drugs. They argued that the stop had not been justified by probable cause to believe, or even reasonable suspicion, that petitioners were engaged in illegal drug-dealing
activity; and that Officer Soto's asserted ground for approaching the vehicle-to give the driver a warning concerning traffic violations-was pretextual. The District Court
denied the suppression motion, concluding that "the facts of
the stop were not controverted," and "[t]here was nothing
to really demonstrate that the actions of the officers were
contrary to a normal traffic stop." App. 5.
Petitioners were convicted of the counts at issue here.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding with
respect to the suppression issue that, "regardless of whether
a police officer subjectively believes that the occupants of an
automobile may be engaging in some other illegal behavior,
a traffic stop is permissible as long as a reasonable officer in
the same circumstances could have stopped the car for the
suspected traffic violation." 53 F. 3d 371, 374-375 (CADC
1995). We granted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1036 (1996).
II
The Fourth Amendment guarantees "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures." Temporary
detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by
the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited
purpose, constitutes a "seizure" of "persons" within the

WHREN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

meaning of this provision. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440
U. S. 648, 653 (1979); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,428
U. S. 543, 556 (1976); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,422
U. S. 873, 878 (1975). An automobile stop is thus subject to
the constitutional imperative that it not be "unreasonable"
under the circumstances. As a general matter, the decision
to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have
probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.
See Prouse, supra, at 659; Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434
U. S. 106, 109 (1977) (per curiam).
Petitioners accept that Officer Soto had probable cause to
believe that various provisions of the District of Columbia
traffic code had been violated. See 18 D. C. Mun. Regs.
§§2213.4 (1995) ("An operator shall ... give full time and
attention to the operation of the vehicle"); 2204.3 ("No person
shall turn any vehicle.., without giving an appropriate signal"); 2200.3 ("No person shall drive a vehicle.., at a speed
greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions"). They argue, however, that "in the unique context
of civil traffic regulations" probable cause is not enough.
Since, they contend, the use of automobiles is so heavily and
minutely regulated that total compliance with traffic and
safety rules is nearly impossible, a police officer will almost
invariably be able to catch any given motorist in a technical
violation. This creates the temptation to use traffic stops
as a means of investigating other law violations, as to which
no probable cause or even articulable suspicion exists. Petitioners, who are both black, further contend that police officers might decide which motorists to stop based on decidedly
impermissible factors, such as the race of the car's occupants.
To avoid this danger, they say, the Fourth Amendment test
for traffic stops should be, not the normal one (applied by
the Court of Appeals) of whether probable cause existed to
justify the stop; but rather, whether a police officer, acting
reasonably, would have made the stop for the reason given.

Opinion of the Court

A
Petitioners contend that the standard they propose is consistent with our past cases' disapproval of police attempts to
use valid bases of action against citizens as pretexts for pursuing other investigatory agendas. We are reminded that
in Floridav. Wells, 495 U. S. 1, 4 (1990), we stated that "an
inventory searchM'j must not be a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence"; that in Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U. S. 367, 372 (1987), in approving an
inventory search, we apparently thought it significant that
there had been "no showing that the police, who were following standardized procedures, acted in bad faith or for the
sole purpose of investigation"; and that in New York v.
Burger,482 U. S. 691, 716-717, n. 27 (1987), we observed, in
upholding the constitutionality of a warrantless administrative inspection, 2 that the search did not appear to be "a 'pretext' for obtaining evidence of ... violation of ... penal
laws." But only an undiscerning reader would regard these
cases as endorsing the principle that ulterior motives can
invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of
probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred.
In each case we were addressing the validity of a search
conducted in the absence of probable cause. Our quoted
statements simply explain that the exemption from the need
for probable cause (and warrant), which is accorded to
searches made for the purpose of inventory or administrative
IAn inventory search is the search of property lawfully seized and detained, in order to ensure that it is harmless, to secure valuable items
(such as might be kept in a towed car), and to protect against false claims
of loss or damage. See Soutth Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 369
(1976).
2
An administrative inspection is the inspection of business premises
conducted by authorities responsible for enforcing a pervasive regulatory
scheme-for example, unannounced inspection of a mine for compliance
with health and safety standards. See Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594,
599-605 (1981).

WHREN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

regulation, is not accorded to searches that are not made
for those purposes. See Bertine, supra, at 371-372; Burger,
supra, at 702-703.
Petitioners also rely upon Coloradov. Bannister,449 U. S.
1 (1980) (percuriam), a case which, like this one, involved a
traffic stop as the prelude to a plain-view sighting and arrest
on charges wholly unrelated to the basis for the stop. Petitioners point to our statement that "[t]here was no evidence
whatsoever that the officer's presence to issue a traffic citation was a pretext to confirm any other previous suspicion
about the occupants" of the car. Id., at 4, n. 4. That dictum
at most demonstrates that the Court in Bannisterfound no
need to inquire into the question now under discussion; not
that it was certain of the answer. And it may demonstrate
even less than that: If by "pretext" the Court meant that the
officer really had not seen the car speeding, the statement
would mean only that there was no reason to doubt probable
cause for the traffic stop.
It would, moreover, be anomalous, to say the least, to treat
a statement in a footnote in the per curiam Bannisteropinion as indicating a reversal of our prior law. Petitioners'
difficulty is not simply a lack of affirmative support for their
position. Not only have we never held, outside the context
of inventory search or administrative inspection (discussed
above), that an officer's motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment; but we have
repeatedly held and asserted the contrary. In United States
v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 584, n. 3 (1983), we
held that an otherwise valid warrantless boarding of a vessel
by customs officials was not rendered invalid "because the
customs officers were accompanied by a Louisiana state policeman, and were following an informant's tip that a vessel
in the ship channel was thought to be carrying marihuana."
We flatly dismissed the idea that an ulterior motive might
serve to strip the agents of their legal justification. In
United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), we held that

Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

a traffic-violation arrest (of the sort here) would not be rendered invalid by the fact that it was "a mere pretext for a
narcotics search," id., at 221, n. 1; and that a lawful postarrest search of the person would not be rendered invalid
by the fact that it was not motivated by the officer-safety
concern that justifies such searches, see id., at 236. See
also Gustafson v. Florida,414 U. S. 260, 266 (1973). And
in Scott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978), in rejecting the contention that wiretap evidence was subject to exclusion because the agents conducting the tap had failed to
make any effort to comply with the statutory requirement
that unauthorized acquisitions be minimized, we said that
"[s]ubjective intent alone.., does not make otherwise lawful
conduct illegal or unconstitutional." We described Robinson as having established that "the fact that the officer does
not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the
reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer's
action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the
circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action." 436
U. S., at 136, 138.
We think these cases foreclose any argument that the
constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the
actual motivations of the individual officers involved. We of
course agree with petitioners that the Constitution prohibits
selective enforcement of the law based on considerations
such as race. But the constitutional basis for objecting to
intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the Equal
Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective
intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth
Amendment analysis.
B
Recognizing that we have been unwilling to entertain
Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers, petitioners disavow any intention
to make the individual officer's subjective good faith the
touchstone of "reasonableness." They insist that the stand-

WHREN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ard they have put forward-whether the officer's conduct
deviated materially from usual police practices, so that a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would not have
made the stop for the reasons given-is an "objective" one.
But although framed in empirical terms, this approach is
plainly and indisputably driven by subjective considerations.
Its whole purpose is to prevent the police from doing under
the guise of enforcing the traffic code what they would like
to do for different reasons. Petitioners' proposed standard
may not use the word "pretext," but it is designed to combat
nothing other than the perceived "danger" of the pretextual
stop, albeit only indirectly and over the run of cases. Instead of asking whether the individual officer had the proper
state of mind, the petitioners would have us ask, in effect,
whether (based on general police practices) it is plausible to
believe that the officer had the proper state of mind.
Why one would frame a test designed to combat pretext
in such fashion that the court cannot take into account actual
and admittedpretext is a curiosity that can only be explained
by the fact that our cases have foreclosed the more sensible
option. If those cases were based only upon the evidentiary
difficulty of establishing subjective intent, petitioners' attempt to root out subjective vices through objective means
might make sense. But they were not based only upon
that, or indeed even principally upon that. Their principal
basis-which applies equally to attempts to reach subjective
intent through ostensibly objective means-is simply that
the Fourth Amendment's concern with "reasonableness"
allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances,
whatever the subjective intent. See, e. g., Robinson, supra,
at 236 ("Since it is the fact of custodial arrest which gives
rise to the authority to search, it is of no moment that [the
officer] did not indicate any subjective fear of the [arrestee]
or that he did not himself suspect that [the arrestee] was
armed") (footnotes omitted); Gustafson,supra,at 266 (same).
But even if our concern had been only an evidentiary one,

Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

petitioners' proposal would by no means assuage it. Indeed,
it seems to us somewhat easier to figure out the intent of an
individual officer than to plumb the collective consciousness
of raw enforcement in order to determine whether a "reasonable officer" would have been moved to act upon the traffic
violation. While police manuals and standard procedures
may sometimes provide objective assistance, ordinarily one
would be reduced to speculating about the hypothetical reaction of a hypothetical constable-an exercise that might be
called virtual subjectivity.
Moreover, police enforcement practices, even if they could
be practicably assessed by a judge, vary from place to place
and from time to time. We cannot accept that the search
and seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment are so
variable, cf. Gustafson, supra, at 265; United States v. Caceres, 440 U. S. 741, 755-756 (1979), and can be made to turn
upon such trivialities. The difficulty is illustrated by petitioners' arguments in this case. Their claim that a reasonable officer would not have made this stop is based largely
on District of Columbia police regulations which permit
plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles to enforce traffic
laws "only in the case of a violation that is so grave as to pose
an immediate threat to the safety of others." Metropolitan
Police Department, Washington, D. C., General Order 303.1,
pt. 1, Objectives and Policies (A)(2)(4) (Apr. 30, 1992), reprinted as Addendum to Brief for Petitioners. This basis
of invalidation would not apply in jurisdictions that had a
different practice. And it would not have applied even in
the District of Columbia, if Officer Soto had been wearing a
uniform or patrolling in a marked police cruiser.
Petitioners argue that our cases support insistence upon
police adherence to standard practices as an objective means
of rooting out pretext. They cite no holding to that effect,
and dicta in only two cases. In Abet v. United States, 362
U. S. 217 (1960), the petitioner had been arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), on the basis of

WHREN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

an administrative warrant that, he claimed, had been issued
on pretextual grounds in order to enable the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) to search his room after his arrest.
We regarded this as an allegation of "serious misconduct,"
but rejected Abel's claims on the ground that "[a] finding of
bad faith is... not open to us on th[e] record" in light of the
findings below, including the finding that "'the proceedings
taken by the [INS] differed in no respect from what would
have been done in the case of an individual concerning whom
[there was no pending FBI investigation],"' id., at 226-227.
But it is a long leap from the proposition that following regular procedures is some evidence of lack of pretext to the
proposition that failure to follow regular procedures proves
(or is an operational substitute for) pretext. Abel, moreover, did not involve the assertion that pretext could invalidate a search or seizure for which there was probable
cause-and even what it said about pretext in other contexts
is plainly inconsistent with the views we later stated in Robinson, Gustafson, Scott, and Villamonte-Marquez. In the
other case claimed to contain supportive dicta, United States
v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), in approving a search incident to an arrest for driving without a license, we noted that
the arrest was "not a departure from established police department practice." Id., at 221, n. 1. That was followed,
however, by the statement that "[w]e leave for another day
questions which would arise on facts different from these."
Ibid. This is not even a dictum that purports to provide an
answer, but merely one that leaves the question open.
III
In what would appear to be an elaboration on the "reasonable officer" test, petitioners argue that the balancing inherent in any Fourth Amendment inquiry requires us to weigh
the governmental and individual interests implicated in a
traffic stop such as we have here. That balancing, petitioners claim, does not support investigation of minor traffic in-

Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

fractions by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles; such
investigation only minimally advances the government's interest in traffic safety, and may indeed retard it by producing
motorist confusion and alarm-a view said to be supported
by the Metropolitan Police Department's own regulations
generally prohibiting this practice. And as for the Fourth
Amendment interests of the individuals concerned, petitioners point out that our cases acknowledge that even ordinary
traffic stops entail "a possibly unsettling show of authority";
that they at best "interfere with freedom of movement, are
inconvenient, and consume time" and at worst "may create
substantial anxiety," Prouse,440 U. S., at 657. That anxiety
is likely to be even more pronounced when the stop is conducted by plainclothes officers in unmarked cars.
It is of course true that in principle every Fourth Amendment case, since it turns upon a "reasonableness" determination, involves a balancing of all relevant factors. With rare
exceptions not applicable here, however, the result of that
balancing is not in doubt where the search or seizure is based
upon probable cause. That is why petitioners must rely
upon cases like Prouse to provide examples of actual "balancing" analysis. There, the police action in question was a
random traffic stop for the purpose of checking a motorist's
license and vehicle registration, a practice that-like the
practices at issue in the inventory search and administrative
inspection cases upon which petitioners rely in making their
"pretext" claim-involves police intrusion without the probable cause that is its traditionaljustification. Our opinion
in Prouse expressly distinguished the case from a stop based
on precisely what is at issue here: "probable cause to believe
that a driver is violating any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations." Id., at 661. It
noted approvingly that "[tihe foremost method of enforcing
traffic and vehicle safety regulations... is acting upon observed violations," id., at 659, which afford the "'quantum
of individualized suspicion"' necessary to ensure that police

WHREN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

discretion is sufficiently constrained, id., at 654-655 (quoting
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,428 U. S., at 560). What
is true of Prouseis also true of other cases that engaged in
detailed "balancing" to decide the constitutionality of automobile stops, such as Martinez-Fuerte,which upheld checkpoint stops, see 428 U. S., at 556-562, and Brignoni-Ponce,
which disallowed so-called "roving patrol" stops, see 422
U. S., at 882-884: The detailed "balancing" analysis was
necessary because they involved seizures without probable
cause.
Where probable cause has existed, the only cases in which
we have found it necessary actually to perform the "balancing" analysis involved searches or seizures conducted in an
extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to an individual's
privacy or even physical interests-such as, for example, seizure by means of deadly force, see Tennessee v. Garner,471
U. S. 1 (1985), unannounced entry into a home, see Wilson v.
Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), entry into a home without a
warrant, see Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 (1984), or
physical penetration of the body, see Winston v. Lee, 470
U. S. 753 (1985). The making of a traffic stop out of uniform
does not remotely qualify as such an extreme practice, and
so is governed by the usual rule that probable cause to believe the law has been broken "outbalances" private interest
in avoiding police contact.
Petitioners urge as an extraordinary factor in this case
that the "multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations" is so large and so difficult to obey perfectly that virtually everyone is guilty of violation, permitting the police
to single out almost whomever they wish for a stop. But
we are aware of no principle that would allow us to decide
at what point a code of law becomes so expansive and so
commonly violated that infraction itself can no longer be the
ordinary measure of the lawfulness of enforcement. And
even if we could identify such exorbitant codes, we do not
know by what standard (or what right) we would decide, as

Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)

819

Opinion of the Court

petitioners would have us do, which particular provisions are
sufficiently important to merit enforcement.
For the run-of-the-mine case, which this surely is, we think
there is no realistic alternative to the traditional commonlaw rule that probable cause justifies a search and seizure.
Here the District Court found that the officers had probable cause to believe that petitioners had violated the traffic
code. That rendered the stop reasonable under the Fourth
Amendment, the evidence thereby discovered admissible,
and the upholding of the convictions by the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit correct. The judgment
is
Affirmed.
