DEGEN v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 95-173. Argued April 22, 1996-Decided June 10, 1996
Petitioner Degen is outside the United States and cannot be extradited to
face federal drug charges. When he filed an answer in a related civil
action, contesting the Government's attempt to forfeit properties allegedly purchased with proceeds from his drug dealings, the District Court
struck his claims and entered summary judgment against him, holding
that he was not entitled to be heard in the forfeiture action because he
remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution. The
court's final order vested title to the properties in the United States,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: A district court may not strike a claimant's filings in a forfeiture
suit and grant summary judgment against him for failing to appear in a
related criminal prosecution. Pp. 822-829.
(a) The Government contends that the District Court's inherent powers authorized it to strike Degen's claims under what has been labeled
the "fugitive disentitlement doctrine." Principles of deference counsel
restraint in resorting to the courts' inherent authority to protect their
proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their traditional
responsibilities, see, e. g., Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 44,
and require its use to be a reasonable response to the problems and
needs provoking it, Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234,
244. Pp. 822-824.
(b) No necessity justifies disentitlement here. Since the court's jurisdiction over the property is secure despite Degen's absence, there is no
risk of delay or frustration in determining the merits of the Government's forfeiture claims or in enforcing the resulting judgment. The
court has alternatives, other than the harsh sanction of disentitlement,
to keep Degen from using liberal civil discovery rules to gain an improper advantage in the criminal prosecution, where discovery is more
limited. Disentitlement also is too arbitrary a means of redressing
the indignity visited upon the court by Degen's absence from the criminal proceedings and deterring flight from criminal prosecution by
Degen and others. A court's dignity derives from the respect accorded
its judgments. That respect is eroded, not enhanced, by excessive

delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we consider whether a United States District
Court may strike the filings of a claimant in a forfeiture suit
and grant summary judgment against him for failing to appear in a related criminal prosecution. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held this to be a proper exercise
of the District Court's inherent authority. We reverse.
A federal grand jury in Nevada indicted Brian Degen for
distributing marijuana, laundering money, and related
crimes. On the same day in 1989 that it unsealed the indictment, the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada also unsealed a civil forfeiture complaint. The Government sought to forfeit properties in California, Nevada,
and Hawaii, allegedly worth $5.5 million and purchased with
proceeds of Degen's drug sales or used to facilitate the sales.
84 Stat. 1276, as amended, 21 U. S. C. §§ 881(a)(6)-(a)(7). An
affidavit by an agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency accompanied the complaint and recounted instances of Degen's
alleged drug smuggling during the previous 20 years.

DEGEN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Degen is a citizen of the United States and of Switzerland,
his father having been born there. Degen moved to Switzerland with his family in 1988. He has not returned to face
the criminal charges against him, and we are advised that
Switzerland's extradition treaty with the United States does
not oblige either country to turn its nationals over to the
other. While remaining outside this country, however,
Degen did file an answer in the civil action to contest the
forfeiture. Among other things, he contended the Government's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, 46
Stat. 758, as amended, 19 U. S. C. § 1621, and based on an
unlawful retroactive application of the forfeiture laws.
The District Court in the forfeiture case did not consider
any of these arguments. Instead it granted the Government's motion to strike Degen's claims and entered summary
judgment against him. The court held Degen was not entitled to be heard in the civil forfeiture action because he
remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution. United States v. Real Property Located at Incline
Village, 755 F. Supp. 308 (1990). After another two years
consumed by procedural matters (for the most part involving
attempts by Degen's wife to contest the forfeiture), the District Court entered a final order vesting title to the properties in the United States. The Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit affirmed. United States v. Real Property Located at Incline Village, 47 F. 3d 1511 (1995). We
granted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1070 (1996).
In an ordinary case a citizen has a right to a hearing to
contest the forfeiture of his property, a right secured by the
Due Process Clause, United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 48-62 (1993); Fuentes v. Shevin,
407 U. S. 67, 80 (1972); McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall.
259, 266-267 (1871), and implemented by federal rule, Rule
C(6) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and
Maritime Claims. Nonetheless, the Government argues, the

Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

District Court's inherent powers authorized it to strike
Degen's claims under what some courts have labeled the "fugitive disentitlement doctrine." We have sustained, to be
sure, the authority of an appellate court to dismiss an appeal
or writ in a criminal matter when the party seeking relief
becomes a fugitive. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507
U. S. 234, 239 (1993); Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97
(1876). The question before us is whether the doctrine
should be extended to allow a court in a civil forfeiture suit
to enter judgment against a claimant because he is a fugitive
from, or otherwise is resisting, a related criminal prosecution. The Courts of Appeals to consider the question have
come to different conclusions (compare the decision here and
in United States v. Eng, 951 F. 2d 461 (CA2 1991), with
United States v. $40,877.59 in United States Currency, 32
F. 3d 1151 (CA7 1994), and United States v. $83,320 in United
States Currency, 682 F. 2d 573 (CA6 1982)), precipitating our
grant of certiorari in this case.
Courts invested with the judicial power of the United
States have certain inherent authority to protect their proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their
traditional responsibilities. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501
U. S. 32, 43-46 (1991); Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626,
630-631 (1962); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34
(1812). The extent of these powers must be delimited with
care, for there is a danger of overreaching when one branch
of the Government, without benefit of cooperation or correction from the others, undertakes to define its own authority.
Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper,447 U. S. 752, 764 (1980).
In many instances the inherent powers of the courts may be
controlled or overridden by statute or rule. Carlisle v.
United States, ante, at 426; Bank of Nova Scotia v. United
States, 487 U. S. 250, 254 (1988). Principles of deference
counsel restraint in resorting to inherent power, Chambers v.
NASCO, supra, at 44, and require its use to be a reasonable

Opinion of the Court

response to the problems and needs that provoke it, OrtegaRodriguez v. United States, supra, at 244; Thomas v. Am,
474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985).
In accord with these principles, we have held federal
courts do have authority to dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the matter is pending. Several reasons have been given for the
rule. First, so long as the party cannot be found, the judgment on review may be impossible to enforce. This was the
rationale of the first case to acknowledge the doctrine, Smith
v. United States, supra, at 97: "It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal case in error, unless the
convicted party, suing out the writ, is where he can be made
to respond to any judgment we may render." See also Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U.S. 692 (1887); Eisler v. United
States, 338 U. S. 189 (1949). Second, we have said an appellant's escape "disentitles" him "to call upon the resources of
the Court for determination of his claims." Molinaro v.
New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970) (per curiam). The
cases cited so far involved the dismissal of fugitives' petitions
in this Court. In reviewing similar practices in state courts
for conformity with the Due Process Clause, we have noted
further reasons for them: Disentitlement "discourages the
felony of escape and encourages voluntary surrenders," and
"promotes the efficient, dignified operation" of the courts.
Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534, 537 (1975) (per curiam)
(using those reasons to justify refusing to reinstate an appeal
even once an escaped appellant is recaptured). See also
Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897).
Against this backdrop came our decision four Terms ago in
Ortega-Rodriguez. The defendant had escaped from federal
custody after conviction but before sentencing. He was sentenced in absentia, but later was recaptured and resentenced; he then fied an appeal, which was dismissed on the
authority of Smith v. United States, supra, and the other
disentitlement cases just described. We reversed, holding

Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

those precedents did not justify dismissal of an appeal by a
fugitive recaptured before the appeal was filed. We noted
the judgment of the Court of Appeals would be enforceable
against the appellant, and that his earlier absence, when no
appeal was pending, did not threaten the dignity of the court
imposing the sanction. Ortega-Rodriguezv. United States,
507 U. S., at 244-246. We did not rule out the possibility of
appellate disentitlement where necessary to prevent actual
prejudice to the Government from a fugitive's extended absence, id., at 249, but we concluded the sanction of disentitlement was unjustified as a sanction applicable to all cases
where an escape once had occurred, id., at 249-251. We conduct a similar examination of the disentitlement imposed
here, and find it likewise unjustified.
There is no risk in this case of delay or frustration in determining the merits of the Government's forfeiture claims
or in enforcing the resulting judgment. The Government
has shown probable cause to forfeit the property, and Degen
must refute the showing or suffer its loss. Since the court's
jurisdiction over the property is secure despite Degen's
absence, there is no danger the court in the forfeiture suit
will waste its time rendering a judgment unenforceable in
practice.
The Government is on stronger ground in suggesting the
criminal prosecution against Degen might be compromised
by his participation in the forfeiture case. The problem
stems from the differences between the discovery privileges
available to Degen in each case. See Afro-Lecon, Inc. v.
United States, 820 F. 2d 1198, 1203-1204 (CA Fed. 1987);
Campbell v. Eastland, 307 F. 2d 478, 487 (CA5 1962). A
criminal defendant is entitled to rather limited discovery,
with no general right to obtain the statements of the Government's witnesses before they have testified. Fed. Rules
Crim. Proc. 16(a)(2), 26.2. In a civil case, by contrast, a
party is entitled as a general matter to discovery of any information sought if it appears "reasonably calculated to lead

DEGEN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

to the discovery of admissible evidence." Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 26(b)(1). The Government contends Degen might use
the rules of civil discovery in the forfeiture suit to gain an
improper advantage in the criminal matter, prying into the
prosecutions case in a manner not otherwise permitted.
These problems are not uncommon when criminal and civil
forfeiture suits are pending at the same time, but they are
made acute by Degen's absence. If he were in federal custody, the risk of compromising the criminal case could be
avoided by staying the civil suit until the prosecution is over.
21 U. S. C. §881(i). Cf. United States v. Kordel, 397 U. S. 1,
9 (1970). Degen rendered this solution impractical by frustrating the prosecution of the criminal case against him.
The criminal trial cannot begin until he returns, Crosby v.
United States, 506 U. S. 255 (1993); if the civil matter were
subordinated to the criminal, the forfeiture could be held in
abeyance for an indefinite time. This delay would be prejudicial to the Government, for if its forfeiture claims are good,
its right to the properties is immediate. We nonetheless are
satisfied the District Court has the means to resolve these
dilemmas without resorting to a rule forbidding all participation by the absent claimant.
First, the District Court has its usual authority to manage
discovery in a civil suit, including the power to enter protective orders limiting discovery as the interests of justice require. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(c). Decisions in the Courts
of Appeals have sustained protective orders to prevent parties from using civil discovery to evade restrictions on discovery in criminal cases. See, e. g., In re Ramu Corp., 903
F. 2d 312, 316-317, 320-321 (CA5 1990); United States v.
Stewart, 872 F. 2d 957, 962-963 (CA10 1989); Campbell v.
Eastland, supra, at 487. See also Capital Engineering &
Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Weinberger,695 F. Supp. 36,41-42 (DC 1988);
Founding Church of Scientology v. Kelley, 77 F. R. D. 378,
380-381 (DC 1977).

Opinion of the Court

Second, the court can exercise its discretion to manage the
civil litigation to avoid interference with the criminal case.
If, for instance, the Government were unable to rebut Degen's arguments except by revealing confidential details of
the criminal investigation, the court could consider controlling or limiting the form of proof, or in an extreme case even
the theories it permits the absent party to pursue, to prevent
him from exploiting the asymmetries he creates by participating in one suit but not the other.
Third, of course, Degen's absence entitles him to no advantage. If his unwillingness to appear in person results in
noncompliance with a legitimate order of the court respecting pleading, discovery, the presentation of evidence, or
other matters, he will be exposed to the same sanctions as
any other uncooperative party. A federal court has at its
disposal an array of means to enforce its orders, including
dismissal in an appropriate case. Again, its powers include
those furnished by federal rule, see, e. g., Fed. Rules Civ.
Proc. 37, 41(b); National Hockey League v. Metropolitan
Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639 (1976) (percuriam);Societe
Internationale pour ParticipationsIndustrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 212 (1958); cf.
United States v. Pole No. 3172, 852 F. 2d 636, 641-642 (CAI
1988), and by inherent authority, see, e. g., Chambers v.
NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S., at 44-45; Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370
U. S., at 630-633; Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., 57 F. 3d 1406,
1416-1417 (CA5 1995); Zebrowski v. Hanna, 973 F. 2d 1001,
1006 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.).
The details of these steps are committed to the discretion
of the District Court; it would be premature to consider now
the precise measures the court should adopt as the case proceeds. The existence of these alternative means of protecting the Government's interests, however, shows the lack of
necessity for the harsh sanction of absolute disentitlement.
Consideration of some of Degen's defenses, such as the statute of limitations, appears to require little discovery. If

DEGEN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

they have merit, the Government should not prevail; if they
are groundless, the Government's interests will not be compromised by their consideration.
We have yet to consider two other purposes said to be
advanced by disentitlement: The need to redress the indignity visited upon the District Court by Degen's absence from
the criminal proceeding, and the need to deter flight from
criminal prosecution by Degen and others. Both interests
are substantial, but disentitlement is too blunt an instrument
for advancing them. Without resolving whether Degen is a
fugitive in all the senses of the word debated by the parties,
we acknowledge disquiet at the spectacle of a criminal defendant reposing in Switzerland, beyond the reach of our
criminal courts, while at the same time mailing papers to the
court in a related civil action and expecting them to be honored. Cf. United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 681-682,
n. 2 (1985). A court-made rule striking Degen's claims and
entering summary judgment against him as a sanction, however, would be an arbitrary response to the conduct it is supposed to redress or discourage.
The right of a citizen to defend his property against attack
in a court is corollary to the plaintiff's right to sue there.
McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall., at 267. For this reason
we have held it unconstitutional to use disentitlement similar
to this as punishment for rebellion against the United States,
ibid., or, in at least one instance, for contempt of court,
Hovey v. Elliott,167 U. S. 409, 413-414 (1897). We need not,
and do not, intimate a view on whether enforcement of a
disentitlement rule under proper authority would violate due
process, cf. Blackmer v. United States, 284 U. S. 421 (1932).
It remains the case, however, that the sanction of disentitlement is most severe and so could disserve the dignitary purposes for which it is invoked. The dignity of a court derives
from the respect accorded its judgments. That respect is
eroded, not enhanced, by too free a recourse to rules foreclosing consideration of claims on the merits.

Opinion of the Court

There would be a measure of rough justice in saying
Degen must take the bitter with the sweet, and participate
in the District Court either for all purposes or none. But
the justice would be too rough. A court's inherent power is
limited by the necessity giving rise to its exercise. There
was no necessity to justify the rule of disentitlement in this
case; to strike Degen's filings and grant judgment against
him would be an excessive response to the concerns here
advanced.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
