OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Per Curiam

SHIEH v. KAKITA ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 95-7587.

Decided April 1, 1996*

In March 1996, this Court invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner Shieh in
forma pauperis status. To date, he has filed 10 petitions in this Court
in less than three years. All were patently frivolous and were denied
without recorded dissent.
Held For the reasons discussed in Martin v. Districtof Columbia Court
of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, Shieh is denied leave to proceed informa pauperis in the instant cases, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any
further petitions for certiorari from him in noncriminal matters unless
he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. This order will not prevent Shieh
from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed
against him, but it will allow this Court to devote its limited resources
to the claims of petitioners who have not abused the certiorari process.
Motions denied.
PER CURIAM.

In these three petitions for certiorari, pro se petitioner
Liang-Houh Shieh requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny his requests
pursuant to Rule 39.8. Shieh is allowed until April 22, 1996,
within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38
and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Shieh in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38
and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Shieh has abused this Court's certiorari process. In
March 1996, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Shieh in forma
pauperis status. See Shieh v. State Bar of California,516
*Together with No. 95-7588, Shieh v. United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, and No. 95-7589, Shieh v. Krieger et al., also on
motion for leave to proceed informa pauperisto the same court.

SHIEH v. KAKITA
STEVENS, J., dissenting

U. S. 1170. To date, Shieh has filed 10 petitions in this Court
in less than three years. All have been both patently frivolous and denied without recorded dissent.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). Shieh's abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our
sanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Shieh from
petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be
imposed against him. The order will, however, allow this
Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For the reasons I have previously expressed, I respectfully
dissent. See Jones v. ABC-TV, 516 U. S. 363, 364 (1996)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting); Attwood v. Singletary, 516 U. S.
297, 298 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Martin v. District
of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Zatko v. California,502 U.S. 16, 18
(1991) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
