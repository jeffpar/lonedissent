Opinion in Chambers

WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC. v. FEDERAL
ELECTION COMMISSION
ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION
No. 04A194. Decided September 14, 2004
Applicant's request for an injunction pending appeal barring the enforcement of § 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)
is denied. Applicant contends that §203-which bans corporations
from using general treasury funds to finance certain electioneering communications-violates the First Amendment as applied to its political
advertisements. An injunction pending appeal would be an extraordinary remedy, particularly when this Court recently held BCRA facially
constitutional, McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93,
189-210, and when a three-judge District Court unanimously rejected
applicant's request for a preliminary injunction. The All Writs Act, the
only source of this Court's authority to issue the instant injunction, is
to be used "'sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479
stances."'
U. S. 1312, 1313, (SCALIA, J., in chambers). Applicant has not established that this extraordinary remedy is appropriate here.

Circuit Justice.
Applicant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., has requested I
grant an injunction pending appeal barring the enforcement
of §203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
(BCRA), 116 Stat. 91, 2 U. S. C. §441b (2000 ed. and Supp.
II), which bars corporations from using general treasury
funds to finance electioneering communications as defined in
BCRA §201. Applicant contends that §203 violates the
First Amendment as applied to its political advertisements.
A three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to BCRA
§403(a)(1), denied applicant's motion for a preliminary injunction and denied applicant's motion for an injunction
pending appeal. I herewith deny the application for an injunction pending appeal.
An injunction pending appeal barring the enforcement of
an Act of Congress would be an extraordinary remedy, parCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC. v. FEDERAL
ELECTION COMM'N
Opinion in Chambers

ticularly when this Court recently held BCRA facially constitutional, McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S.
93, 189-210 (2003), and when a unanimous three-judge District Court rejected applicant's request for a preliminary
injunction. See Turner BroadcastingSystem, Inc. v. FCC,
507 U. S. 1301, 1302-1303 (1993) (REHNQUIST, C. J., in chambers). The All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a), is the only
source of this Court's authority to issue such an injunction.
That authority is to be used "'"sparingly and only in the
most critical and exigent circumstances."'" Ohio Citizens
for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313
(1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers) (quoting Fishnn v. Schaffer, 429 U. S. 1325, 1326 (1976) (Marshall, J., in chambers)).
It is only appropriately exercised where (1) "necessary or
appropriate in aid of [our] jurisdictio[n]," 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a),
and (2) the legal rights at issue are "indisputably clear,"
Brown v. Gilmore, 533 U. S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (REHNQUIST,
C. J., in chambers). Applicant has failed to establish that
this extraordinary remedy is appropriate. Therefore, I decline to issue an injunction pending appeal in this case.
