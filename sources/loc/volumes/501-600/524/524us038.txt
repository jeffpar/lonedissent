UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 97-731. Argued April 27, 1998-Decided June 8, 1998
In 1979, the United States sued respondents and others to quiet title to
land it sought for a federal park, contending that respondents did not
have clear title because the Government had never patented the disputed land after acquiring it as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Government officials searched public land records during discovery, but reported to respondents that they found no proof of a grant to a private
landowner. A 1982 settlement agreement quieted title in the Government's favor in return for a payment to respondents. In 1994, respondents sued to set aside the settlement agreement and obtain damages,
claiming that they had evidence showing that the land had been granted
to a private owner before the Louisiana Purchase, but the District Court
concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The Fifth Circuit
reversed, finding two jurisdictional bases: (1) the suit was an "independent action" to set aside the settlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b); and (2) the Quiet Title Act (QTA or Act). In reaching the
second conclusion, the court found that the QTA's 12-year statute of
limitations was subject to equitable tolling and therefore suit was not
barred by the fact that respondents had known about the Government's
claim since 1979. The court then vacated the settlement agreement and
instructed the District Court to quiet title in respondents' favor.
Hel& The Fifth Circuit had no jurisdiction over respondents' suit.
Pp. 42-49.
(a) Rule 60(b)'s history and language are inconsistent with the Government's position that an "independent action" to set aside a judgment
requires an independent source of jurisdiction. The original Rule 60(b)
established a new system to govern requests to reopen judgments. Because it was unclear whether that Rule provided the exclusive means
for obtaining postjudgment relief, the Rule was amended in 1946 to
clarify that nearly all of the old forms of obtaining relief from a judgment were abolished but that the "independent action" survived. However, this does not mean that the requirements for a meritorious independent action have been met here. Such actions should be available
only to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice. See Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co. v. Hartford-EmpireCo., 822 U. S.238,244. Respondents' allegation
that the United States failed to thoroughly search its records and make

Opinion of the Court
full disclosure to the District Court regarding the land grant obviously
does not approach this demanding standard. Pp. 42-47.
(b) Equitable tolling is not available in a QTA suit. Such tolling is
not permissible where it is inconsistent with the relevant statute's text.
The QTA's express 12-year statute of limitations runs from the date the
plaintiff or his predecessor in interest "knew or should have known" of
the United States' claim. 28 U. S. C. §2409(g). Thus, the Act has already effectively allowed for equitable tolling. See Ivwin v. Departmerit of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96. Given this fact and the
QTA's unusually generous limitations period, extension of the statutory
period would be unwarranted. Pp. 47-49.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In 1979, the United States brought a quiet title action (the
Adams litigation) in the Southern District of Mississippi
against respondents and nearly 200 other defendants. On
the eve of trial, the Government and respondents entered
into a settlement whereby title to the disputed land was
quieted in favor of the United States in return for a payment
of $208,175.87. Judgment was entered based on this settlement agreement. In 1994, some 12 years after that judgment, respondents sued in the District Court to set aside the
settlement agreement and obtain a damages award for the
disputed land. Their claims for relief were based on the

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court

court's ancillary jurisdiction, relating back to the Adams
litigation, and on the Quiet Title Act (QTA). 28 U. S. C.
§ 2409a. We hold that respondents were not entitled to
relief on either of these grounds.
The land in dispute between the United States and respondents is located on Horn Island. Situated in the Gulf
of Mexico approximately 13 miles southwest of Pascagoula,
Horn Island is currently within the State of Mfississippi. It
was, at various times during the late 18th and early 19th
centuries, controlled by France, Britain, and Spain. It is
part of the territory that came under the control of the
United States as a result of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
In 1950, Clark Beggerly, respondents' predecessor-ininterest, purchased color of title to two tracts of land on Horn
Island at a tax sale in Jackson County. Beggerly paid $51.20
for one 626-acre tract. He and a friend also purchased a
second tract for $31.25. Beggerly retained 103 acres upon a
later division of this second tract.
In 1971, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the Department of the Interior to create the Gulf Islands National
Seashore, a federal park on lands that include Horn Island.
16 U. S. C. §459h. The legislation authorized the Secretary
of the Interior to acquire privately owned lands within the
proposed park's boundaries. §459h-1. The National Park
Service (NPS) began negotiating with respondents to purchase the land. Before any deal could be completed, however, the NPS learned that the United States Government
had never patented the property. Believing that this meant
that respondents could not have had clear title, the NPS
backed out of the proposed deal.
During discovery in the Adams litigation, respondents
sought proof of their title to the land. Government officials
searched public land records and told respondents that they
had found nothing proving that any part of Horn Island had
ever been granted to a private landowner. Even after the
settlement in the Adams litigation, however, respondents

Cite as: 524 U. S. 38 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

continued to search for evidence of a land patent that supported their claim of title. In 1991 they hired a genealogical
record specialist to conduct research in the National Archives in Washington. The specialist found materials that,
according to her, showed that on August 1, 1781, Bernardo
de Galvez, then the Governor General of Spanish Louisiana,
granted Horn Island to Catarina Boudreau. If the land had
been granted to a private party prior to 1803, title presumably could not have passed to the United States as a result
of the Louisiana Purchase. Respondents believed that the
Boudreau grant proved that their claim to the disputed land
was superior to that of the United States.
Armed with this new information, respondents filed a complaint in the District Court on June 1, 1994. They asked the
court to set aside the 1982 settlement agreement and award
them damages of "not less than $14,500 per acre" of the disputed land. App. 26. The District Court concluded that it
was without jurisdiction to hear respondents' suit and dismissed the complaint.
The Court of Appeals reversed. It concluded that there
were two jurisdictional bases for the suit. First, the suit
satisfied the elements of an "independent action," as the
term is used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). According to the Court of Appeals, those elements are:
"(1) a judgment which ought not, in equity and good
conscience, to be enforced; (2) a good defense to the alleged cause of action on which the judgment is founded;
(3) fraud, accident, or mistake which prevented the defendant in the judgment from obtaining the benefit of
his defense; (4) the absence of fault or negligence on the
part of the defendant; and (5) the absence of any adequate remedy at law." 114 F. 3d 484, 487 (CA5 1997).
In its view, the settlement agreement could therefore be set
aside. Second, the Court of Appeals concluded that the QTA
conferred jurisdiction. The QTA includes a 12-year statute

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court

of limitations, which begins to run from the date the plaintiff
knows or should have known about the claim of the United
States. 28 U. S. C. § 2409a(g). The Court of Appeals noted
that respondents knew about the Government's claim for
more than 12 years before it filed this suit, but concluded
that the 12-year statute was subject to equitable tolling and
should be tolled in this case.
Satisfied as to its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals then
addressed the merits. Relying on the Boudreau grant, the
court concluded that the "United States has no legitimate
claim to the land [and that] the validity of the Beggerlys'
title is a legal certainty." 114 F. 3d, at 489. It therefore
vacated the settlement agreement and remanded the case to
the District Court with instructions that it enter judgment
quieting title in favor of respondents. One judge dissented.
We granted certiorari, 522 U. S.1038 (1998), and now reverse.
The Government's primary contention is that the Court
of Appeals erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over
respondents' 1994 suit. It first attacks the lower court's
conclusion that jurisdiction was established because the
suit was an "independent action" within the meaning of Rule
60(b). The Government argues that an "independent action" must be supported by an independent source of jurisdiction, and, in the case of a suit against the United States,
an independent waiver of sovereign immunity. Whereas the
District Court had jurisdiction over the original Adams litigation because the United States was the plaintiff, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1345, there was no statutory basis for the Beggerlys' 1994
action, and the District Court was therefore correct to have
dismissed it.
We think the Government's position is inconsistent with
the history and language of Rule 60(b). Prior to the 1937
adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the availability of relief from a judgment or order turned on whether
the court was still in the same "term" in which the challenged judgment was entered. If it was, the judge "had ple-

Opinion of the Court

nary power.., to modify his judgment for error of fact or
law or even revoke it altogether." Zimmern v. United
States, 298 U. S. 167, 169-170 (1936). If the term had expired, resort had to be made to a handful of writs, the precise
contours of which were "shrouded in ancient lore and mystery." Advisory Committee's Notes on 1946 Amdt. to Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 60,28 U. S. C. App., p. 787. The new Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure did away with the notion that the
continuation or expiration of a term of court had any affect
on a court's power. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 6(c), rescinded 1966.
New Rule 60(b)' sought to establish a new system to govern requests to reopen judgments. The original Rule 60(b)
provided:
"(b) Mistake; Inadvertence; Surprise; Excusable Neglect. On motion the court, upon such terms as are
just, may relieve a party or his legal representative from
a judgment, order, or proceeding taken against him
through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after
such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken. A motion under this subdivision does not affect the finality of
a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does
not limit the power of a court (1) to entertain an action
to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding,
or (2) to set aside within one year, as provided in Section
57 of the Judicial Code, U. S. C., Title 28, § 118, a judgment obtained against a defendant not actually personally notified." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b) (1940).
In the years following the adoption of the Rules, however,
courts differed over whether the new Rule 60(b) provided
the exclusive means for obtaining postjudgment relief, or
whether the writs that had been used prior to the adoption of
1 Rule 60(a)

in judgments.

dealt then, as it deals now, with relief from clerical mistakes

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court

the Federal Rules still survived. This problem, along with
several others, was addressed in the 1946 amendment to
Rule 60(b). The 1946 amendment revised the Rule to read
substantially as it reads now:
"(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc. On motion and upon
such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or
a party's legal representative from a final judgment,
order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2)
newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be
made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),
and (3) not more than one year after the judgment,
order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion
under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of
a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does
not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or
proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually
personally notified as provided in Title 28, U. S. C.,
§ 1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the
court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill
of review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining
any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as pre-

Cite as: 524 U. S. 38 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

scribed in these rules or by an independent action."
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b).
The new Rule thus made clear that nearly all of the old
forms of obtaining relief from a judgment, i. e., coram nobis,
coram vobis, auditaquerela, bills of review, and bills in the
nature of review, had been abolished. The revision made
equally clear, however, that one of the old forms, i. e., the
"independent action," 2 still survived. The Advisory Committee notes confirmed this, indicating that "[i]f the right to
make a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits
fixed in these rules, the only other procedural remedy is by
a new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon
those principles which have heretofore been applied in such
an action." Advisory Committee's Notes, supra,at 787.
The "independent action" sounded in equity. While its
precise contours are somewhat unclear, it appears to have
been more broadly available than the more narrow writs that
the 1946 amendment abolished. One case that exemplifies
the category is Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v. Missouri Pacific R.
Co., 111 U. S. 505 (1884).3
In Pacific the underlying suit had resulted in a court decree foreclosing a mortgage on railroad property and ordering its sale. This Court enforced the decree and shortly
thereafter the railroad company whose property had been
foreclosed filed a bill to impeach for fraud the foreclosure
decree that had just been affirmed. The bill alleged that
the plaintiffs in the underlying suit had conspired with the
attorney and directors of the plaintiff in the subsequent suit
to ensure that the property would be forfeited. The plaintiff in the subsequent suit was a Missouri corporation, and it
2

This form of action was also referred to as an "original action."
The authorities that the Advisory Committee cited in its notes accompanying the 1946 amendment to the Rule list Pacific as an example of this
cause of action. Moore & Rogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments,

Practice 3257, n. 12 (1938).

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court

named several other Missouri citizens as defendants in its
bill seeking relief from the prior judgment.
When the matter reached this Court, we rejected the contention that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over the
bill because the plaintiff and several of the defendants were
from the same State. We first noted that there was no question as to the court's jurisdiction over the underlying suit,
and then said:
"On the question of jurisdiction the [subsequent] suit
may be regarded as ancillary to the [prior] suit, so that
the relief asked may be granted by the court which
made the decree in that suit, without regard to the citizenship of the present parties ....

The bill, though

an original bill in the chancery sense of the word, is a
continuation of the former suit, on the question of the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court." Id., at 522.
Even though there was no diversity, the Court relied on the
underlying suit as the basis for jurisdiction and allowed the
independent action to proceed. The Government is therefore wrong to suggest that an independent action brought in
the same court as the original lawsuit requires an independent basis for jurisdiction.
This is not to say, however, that the requirements for a
meritorious independent action have been met here. If relief may be obtained through an independent action in a case
such as this, where the most that may be charged against
the Government is a failure to furnish relevant information
that would at best form the basis for a Rule 60(b)(3) motion,
the strict 1-year time limit on such motions would be set at
naught. Independent actions must, if Rule 60(b) is to be
interpreted as a coherent whole, be reserved for those cases
of "injustices which, in certain instances, are deemed sufficiently gross to demand a departure" from rigid adherence
to the doctrine of res judicata. Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.
Hartford-EmpireCo., 322 U. S. 238, 244 (1944).

Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)

Opinion of the Court

Such a case was Marshall v. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589 (1891),
in which the plaintiff alleged that judgment had been taken
against her in the underlying action as a result of a forged
document. The Court said:
"According to the averments of the original petition for
injunction... the judgments in question would not have
been rendered against Mrs. Marshall but for the use in
evidence of the letter alleged to be forged. The case
evidently intended to be presented by the petition is one
where, without negligence, laches or other fault upon
the part of petitioner, [respondent] has fraudulently obtained judgments which he seeks, against conscience, to
enforce by execution." Id., at 596.
The sense of these expressions is that, under the Rule, an
independent action should be available only to prevent a
grave miscarriage of justice. In this case, it should be obvious that respondents' allegations do not nearly approach this
demanding standard. Respondents allege only that the
United States failed to "thoroughly search its records and
make full disclosure to the Court" regarding the Boudreau
grant. App. 23. Whether such a claim might succeed
under Rule 60(b)(3), we need not now decide; it surely would
work no "grave miscarriage of justice," and perhaps no miscarriage of justice at all, to allow the judgment to stand.
We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that this was a sufficient basis to justify the reopen4
ing of the judgment in the Adams litigation.
The Court of Appeals did not, however, merely reopen the
Adams litigation. It also directed the District Court to
quiet title to the property in respondents' favor. The Court
of Appeals believed that the QTA, 28 U. S. C. §2409a, provided jurisdiction to do this. The QTA permits "plaintiffs
4

We therefore need not address the additional requirement that evidence of the Boudreau grant would have changed the outcome of the original action. See, e. g., Pickford v. Talbott, 225 U. S.651, 657 (1912).

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court

to name [the United States] as a party defendant in civil actions to adjudicate title disputes involving real property in
which the United States claims an interest." Block v. North
Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S.
273, 275-276 (1983). The QTA includes an express 12-year
statute of limitations, which begins to run from the date
upon which the plaintiff's cause of action accrued. An
action under the QTA "shall be deemed to have accrued
on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew
or should have known of the claim of the United States."
§ 2409a(g).
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Beggerlys
had known about the Government's claim to the land since
at least 1979, more than 12 years before they filed this action
in 1994. It concluded that the suit was not barred, however,
because the QTA's statute of limitations was subject to equitable tolling, and that, "in light of the diligence displayed
by the [respondents] in seeking the truth and pursuing their
rights," equity demanded that the statute be tolled in this
case. 114 F. 3d, at 489. In our view, the Court of Appeals
was wrong in deciding that equitable tolling is available in a
QTA suit.
Equitable tolling is not permissible where it is inconsistent
with the text of the relevant statute. United States v.
Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347 (1997). Here, the QTA, by providing that the statute of limitations will not begin to run until
the plaintiff "knew or should have known of the claim of the
United States," has already effectively allowed for equitable
tolling. See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498
U. S. 89, 96 (1990) ("We have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial
remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory
period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked
by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass"). Given this fact, and the unusually generous

Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)
STEVENS, J.,

concurring

nature of the QTA's limitations time period, extension of the
statutory period by additional equitable tolling would be unwarranted. This is particularly true given that the QTA
deals with ownership of land. It is of special importance
that landowners know with certainty what their rights are,
and the period during which those rights may be subject to
challenge. Equitable tolling of the already generous statute
of limitations incorporated in the QTA would throw a cloud
of uncertainty over these rights, and we hold that it is incompatible with the Act.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins,
concurring.
As the Court correctly observes, the text of the Quiet Title
Act, 28 U. S. C. §2409a(g), expressly allows equitable tolling
by providing that the statute of limitations will not begin to
run until the plaintiff or the plaintiff's predecessor "knew or
should have known of the claim of the United States." Because the Beggerlys were aware of the Government's claim
more than 12 years before they filed this action, the Court
correctly holds that there is no basis for any additional equitable tolling in this case. We are not confronted with the
question whether a doctrine such as fraudulent concealment
or equitable estoppel might apply if the Government were
guilty of outrageous misconduct that prevented the plaintiff,
though fully aware of the Government's claim of title, from
knowing of her own claim. Those doctrines are distinct
from equitable tolling, see 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 1056 (Supp. 1998); cf. United States
v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 94, n. 10 (1985) (referring separately
to estoppel and equitable tolling), and conceivably might

50

apply in such an unlikely hypothetical situation. The Court
need not (and, therefore, properly does not) address that
quite different type of case. Accordingly, I join the Court's
opinion without reservation.
