Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.

See

Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Rivera seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
pursuant to Rule 39.8. Rivera is allowed until April 12,
1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule
38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor petitions for extraordinary
writs from Rivera in noncriminal matters unless he pays the
docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition
in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Rivera has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary writ processes. In January of this year, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Rivera in forma pauperis status.
See Rivera v. Allin, 525 U. S. 1065; In re Rivera, 525 U. S.
1066. At that time, Rivera had filed two petitions for extraordinary writs and eight petitions for certiorari, all of
which were both patently frivolous and had been denied
without recorded dissent. The instant petition for certiorari thus constitutes Rivera's 13th frivolous filing with this

Court. He has four additional filings-all of them patently
frivolous-currently pending before this Court.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Rivera's abuse of
the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been
in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Rivera from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. The order, however, will allow this Court to
devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who
have not abused our process.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
