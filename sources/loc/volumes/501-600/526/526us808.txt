CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 97-1927. Argued March 24, 1999-Decided May 24, 1999
Respondents filed this suit for damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown
Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, alleging that petitioners-United
States Fish and Wildlife Service special agents and an assistant United
States attorney-violated their Fourth Amendment rights when the
agents, accompanied by Cable News Network, Inc., photographers and
reporters, searched respondents' ranch and its outbuildings pursuant to
a warrant.
Held: Although respondents allege a Fourth Amendment violation under
Wilson v. Layne, ante, p. 603, petitioners are entitled to a qualified immunity defense. In Wilson, this Court held that police violate homeownerns' Fourth Amendment rights when they allow the media to accompany them during the execution of a warrant in a home, but that because
the law was not clearly established before today, the police in that case
were entitled to a qualified immunity defense. Wilson makes clear that
respondents' right was not established in 1992, and the parties here
have cited no decisions which would have made the law any clearer
when this search took place a year later.
129 F. 3d 505, vacated and remanded.

Per Curiam
PER CURIAM.

Respondents Paul and Erma Berger sued petitionersspecial agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
and an assistant United States attorney-for damages under
Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. NarcoticsAgents, 403 U. S. 388
(1971). They alleged that the conduct of petitioners had
violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. 129 F. 3d 505 (CA9 1997). We
granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 981 (1998).
Respondents live on a 75,000-acre ranch near Jordan, Montana. In 1993, a Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing the search of "The Paul W. Berger ranch with appurtenant structures, excluding the residence" for evidence of
"the taking of wildlife in violation of Federal laws." App.
17. About a week later, a multiple-vehicle caravan consisting of Government agents and a crew of photographers and
reporters from Cable News Network, Inc. (CNN), proceeded
to a point near the ranch. The agents executed the warrant
and explained: "Over the course of the day, the officers
searched the ranch and its outbuildings pursuant to the authority conferred by the search warrant. The CNN media
crew . . . accompanied and observed the officers, and the

media crew recorded the officers' conduct in executing the
warrant." Brief for Petitioners 5.
Review of the complaint's much more detailed allegations
to the same effect satisfies us that respondents alleged a
Fourth Amendment violation under our decision today in
Birenz, Slade R. Metcalf, Jack N. Goodman, David S. J. Brown, Renj P.
Milam, George Freeman, and Jane E. Kirtley.
Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Joshua L. Dratel; and for
the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys by
Kevin P. Roddy.
M. Reed Hopper and Robin L. Rivett filed a brief for the Pacific Legal
Foundation as amicus curiae.

HANLON v. BERGER
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Wilson v. Layne, ante, p. 603. There we hold that police
violate the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners when
they allow members of the media to accompany them during
the execution of a warrant in their home. We also hold
there that because the law on this question before today's
decision was not clearly established, the police in that case
were entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. Ante,
at 605-606.
Petitioners maintain that even though they may have violated the Fourth Amendment rights of respondents, they are
entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. We agree.
Our holding in Wilson makes clear that this right was not
clearly established in 1992. The parties have not called our
attention to any decisions which would have made the state
of the law any clearer a year later-at the time of the search
in this case. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
As I explain in my dissent in Wilson v. Layne, ante, p. 618,
I am convinced that the constitutional rule recognized in that
case had been clearly established long before 1992. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this
case on qualified immunity grounds.
