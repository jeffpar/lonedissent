BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS,
WABAUNSEE COUNTY, KANSAS
v. UMBEHR
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-1654.

Argued November 28, 1995-Decided June 28, 1996

During the term of his at-will contract with Wabaunsee County, Kansas
(County), to haul trash, respondent Umbehr was an outspoken critic of
petitioner Board of County Commissioners (Board). After the commissioners voted to terminate (or prevent the automatic renewal of) the
contract, allegedly because they took Umbehr's criticism badly, he
brought this suit against two of them under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The
District Court granted them summary judgment, but the Tenth Circuit
reversed in relevant part and remanded, holding that the First Amendment protects independent contractors from governmental retaliation
against their speech, and that the extent of that protection must be
determined by weighing the government's interests as contractor
against the free speech interests at stake in accordance with the balancing test applied in the government employment context under Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391
U. S. 563, 568.
Held: The First Amendment protects independent contractors from the
termination or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will government
contracts in retaliation for their exercise of the freedom of speech, and
the Pickering balancing test, adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines the extent of
that protection. Pp. 673-686.
(a) Because of the obvious similarities between government employees and government contractors with respect to this issue, the
Court is guided by its government employment precedents. Among
other things, those precedents have recognized that government workers are constitutionally protected from dismissal for publicly or privately criticizing their employer's policies, see, e. g., Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, but have also acknowledged that the First
Amendment does not guarantee absolute freedom of speech, see, e. g.,
Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 146, and have required a fact-sensitive
and deferential weighing of the government employer's legitimate interests against its employees' First Amendment rights, see, e. g., Pickering, supra,at 568. The parties' attempts to differentiate between inde-

Syllabus
pendent contractors and government employees are unavailing. Each
of their arguments for and against the imposition of liability has some
force, but all of them can be accommodated by applying the existing
government employee framework. Moreover, application of the nuanced Pickering approach is superior to a bright-line rule giving the
government carte blanche to terminate independent contractors for exercising their speech rights. Although both the individual's and the
government's interests are typically-though not always-somewhat
less strong in an independent contractor case, the fact that such contractors are similar in most relevant respects to government employees
compels the conclusion that the same form of balancing analysis should
apply to each. Pp. 673-681.
(b) Neither the dissent's fears of excessive litigation, nor its assertion
that the allocation of government contracts on the basis of political bias
is a longstanding tradition, can deprive independent contractors of
protection. Its own description of "lowest-responsible-bidder" requirements in a wide range of government contracting laws voluntarily
adopted by federal and state authorities suggests that government
contracting norms incompatible with political bias have proliferated
without unduly burdening the government, and such laws have a long
history. Pp. 681-685.
(c) Because the courts below assumed that Umbehr's termination (or
nonrenewal) was in retaliation for his protected speech activities, and
did not pass on the balance between the government's interests and his
free speech interests, the conclusion that independent contractors do
enjoy some First Amendment protection requires affirmance of the
Tenth Circuit's decision to remand the case. To prevail, Umbehr must
show initially that the termination of his contract was motivated by his
speech on a matter of public concern, see Connick, supra, at 146; he
must therefore prove more than the mere fact that he criticized the
Board members before he was terminated. If he can do so, the Board
will have a valid defense if it can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, in light of their knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the
time of the termination, the Board members would have terminated the
contract regardless of his speech. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287. The Board will also prevail if it can demonstrate that the County's legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially
viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake. See, e. g., Pickering, supra, at 568. And, if Umbehr prevails, evidence that the Board
members discovered facts after termination that would have led to a
later termination anyway, and evidence of mitigation of his loss by
means of subsequent trash hauling contracts with cities in the County,
would be relevant in assessing the appropriate remedy. Because

Opinion of the Court

within its borders. In 1981, and, after renegotiation, in
1985, the County contracted with respondent Umbehr for
him to be the exclusive hauler of trash for cities in the
County at a rate specified in the contract. Each city was
free to reject or, on 90 days' notice, to opt out of, the contract. By its terms, the contract between Umbehr and the
County was automatically renewed annually unless either
party terminated it by giving notice at least 60 days before
the end of the year or a renegotiation was instituted on 90
days' notice. Pursuant to the contract, Umbehr hauled
trash for six of the County's seven cities from 1985 to 1991
on an exclusive and uninterrupted basis.
During the term of his contract, Umbehr was an outspoken
critic of petitioner, the Board of County Commissioners of
Wabaunsee County (Board), the three-member governing
body of the County. Umbehr spoke at the Board's meetings,
and wrote critical letters and editorials in local newspapers
regarding the County's landfill user rates, the cost of obtaining official documents from the County, alleged violations by
the Board of the Kansas Open Meetings Act, the County's
alleged mismanagement of taxpayers' money, and other topics. His allegations of violation of the Kansas Open Meetings Act were vindicated in a consent decree signed by the
Board's members. Umbehr also ran unsuccessfully for election to the Board.
The Board's members allegedly took Umbehr's criticism
badly, threatening the official county newspaper with censorship for publishing his writings. In 1990, they voted, 2 to 1,
to terminate (or prevent the automatic renewal of) Umbehr's
contract with the County. That attempt at termination
failed because of a technical defect, but in 1991, the Board
succeeded in terminating Umbehr's contract, again by a 2 to
1 vote. Umbehr subsequently negotiated new contracts
with five of the six cities that he had previously served.
In 1992, Umbehr brought this suit against the two majority Board members in their individual and official capacities

672

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
Opinion of the Court

under Rev. Stat. § '1979, as amended, -42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that they had terminated his government*contract in retaliation for his criticism of the County and the Board. The
Board members moved for summary judgment. The District Court assumed that Umbehr's contract *as terminated
in retaliation for his speech, and that he suffered consequential damages. But it held that "the First Amdndment does
not prohibit [the Board] from considering [Umbehr's] expression as a factor in deciding not to continue with the trash
hauling contract at the end of the contract's annual term,"
because, as an independent contractor, Umbehr was not entitled to the First Amendment protection afforded to public
employees. Umbehr v. McClure, 840 F. Supp. 837, 839 (Kan.
1993). It also held that the claims against the Board members in their individual capacities would be barred by qualified immunity, id., at 841, a ruling which was affirmed on
appeal and which is not at issue here.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
reversed (except as to qualified immunity), holding that "an
independent contractor is protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory governmental action, just as an employee would be," and that the extent of protection is to
be determined by weighing the government's interests as
contractor against the free speech interests at stake in accordance with the balancing test that we used to determine
government employees' First Amendment rights in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist.205, Will
Cty., 391 U. S.563, 568 (1968). 44 F. 3d 876, 883 (CA101995).
It therefore remanded the official capacity claims to the District Court for further proceedings, including consideration
of whether the termination was in fact retaliatory. The
Board members who were the original defendants in this suit
subsequently resigned their positions on the Board, so in this
Court, the Board was substituted for them as petitioner.
See this Court's Rule 35.3.

Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the
Courts of Appeals regarding whether, and to what extent,
independent contractors are protected by the First Amendment. The Fifth and Eighth Circuits agree with the Tenth
Circuit. See Blackburn v. Marshall, 42 F. 3d 925, 931-935
(CA5 1995); Copsey v. Swearingen, 36 F. 3d 1336, 1344 (CA5
1994); North Mississippi Communications,Inc. v. Jones, 792
F. 2d 1330 (CA5 1986); Smith v. Cleburne County Hospital,
870 F. 2d 1375, 1381 (CA8), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 847 (1989);
but see Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F. 2d 542 (CA8), cert. denied,
459 U. S. 878 (1982). See also Abercrombie v. Catoosa, 896
F. 2d 1228, 1233 (CA10 1990) (allowing an independent contractor to sue for termination based on his speech and political activities). The Third and Seventh Circuits have, however, held that an independent contractor who does not have
a property interest in his contract with the government has
no right not to have that contract terminated in retaliation
for his exercise of First Amendment freedoms of political
affiliation and participation. See Horn v. Kean, 796 F. 2d
668 (CA3 1986) (en banc); O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v.
Northlake, 47 F. 3d 883 (CA7 1995), reversed, post, p. 712;
Downtown Auto Parks, Inc. v. Milwaukee, 938 F. 2d 705
(CA7), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1005 (1991); Triad Assocs., Inc.
v. Chicago Housing Authority, 892 F. 2d 583 (CA7 1989),
cert. denied, 498 U. S. 845 (1990).
We agree with the Tenth Circuit that independent contractors are protected, and that the Pickering balancing test,
adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor
rather than as employer, determines the extent of their protection. We therefore affirm.
II
A
This Court has not previously considered whether, and to
what extent, the First Amendment restricts the freedom of

674

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
Opinion of the Court

federal, state, or local governments to terminate their relationships with independent contractors because of the contractors' speech. We have, however, considered the same
issue in the context of government employees' rights on
several occasions. The similarities between government
employees and government contractors with respect to this
issue are obvious. The government needs to be free to terminate both employees and contractors for poor performance, to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and responsiveness
of service to the public, and to prevent the appearance of
corruption. And, absent contractual, statutory, or constitutional restriction, the government is entitled to terminate
them for no reason at all. But either type of relationship
provides a valuable financial benefit, the threat of the loss of
which in retaliation for speech may chill speech on matters
of public concern by those who, because of their dealings
with the government, "are often in the best position to know
what ails the agencies for which they work," Waters v.
Churchill, 511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion). Because of these similarities, we turn initially to our government employment precedents for guidance.
Those precedents have long since rejected Justice Holmes'
famous dictum, that a policeman "may have a constitutional
right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be
a policeman," McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford, 155 Mass.
216, 220, 29 N. E. 517 (1892). Recognizing that "constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or 'chilling,'
effect of governmental [efforts] that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights,"
Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 11 (1972), our modern "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine holds that the government
"may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes
his constitutionally protected.., freedom of speech" even if
he has no entitlement to that benefit, Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972). We have held that government
workers are constitutionally protected from dismissal for re-

Opinion of the Court

fusing to take an oath regarding their political affiliation, see,
e. g., Wieman v. Updegraff,344 U. S. 183 (1952); Keyishian
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y, 385 U. S. 589
(1967), for publicly or privately criticizing their employer's
policies, see Perry, supra; Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977); Givhan v. Western Line Consol.
School Dist., 439 U. S. 410 (1979), for expressing hostility to
prominent political figures, see Rankin v. McPherson, 483
U. S. 378 (1987), or, except where political affiliation may reasonably be considered an appropriate job qualification, for
supporting or affiliating with a particular political party, see,
e. g., Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980). See also United
States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454 (1995) (Government employees are protected from undue burdens on
their expressive activities created by a prohibition against
accepting honoraria); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S.
209, 234 (1977) (government employment cannot be conditioned on making or not making financial contributions to
particular political causes).
While protecting First Amendment freedoms, we have,
however, acknowledged that the First Amendment does not
create property or tenure rights, and does not guarantee
absolute freedom of speech. The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech protects government employees
from termination because of their speech on matters of
public concern. See Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146
(1983) (speech on merely private employment matters is
unprotected). To prevail, an employee must prove that the
conduct at issue was constitutionally protected, and that it
was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination.
If the employee discharges that burden, the government can
escape liability by showing that it would have taken the
same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.
See Mt. Healthy, supra, at 287. And even termination because of protected speech may be justified when legitimate
countervailing government interests are sufficiently strong.

676

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
Opinion of the Court

Government employees' First Amendment rights depend on
the "balance between the interests of the [employee], as a
citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and
the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the
efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." Pickering,391 U. S., at 568. In striking that balance, we have concluded that "[t]he government's interest in
achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is
elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts
as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer."
Waters, 511 U. S., at 675 (plurality opinion). We have, therefore, "consistently given greater deference to government
predictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee
speech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on the speech of the public at large." Id., at 673; accord, Treasury Employees, supra, at 475.
The parties each invite us to differentiate between independent contractors and employees. The Board urges us
not to "extend" the First Amendment rights of government
employees to contractors. Umbehr, joined by the Solicitor General as amicus curiae, contends that, on proof of
viewpoint-based retaliation for contractors' political speech,
the government should be required to justify its actions as
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.
Both parties observe that independent contractors in general, and Umbehr in particular, work at a greater remove
from government officials than do most government employees. In the Board's view, the key feature of an independent
contractor's contract is that it does not give the government
the right to supervise and control the details of how work is
done. The Board argues that the lack of day-to-day control
accentuates the government's need to have the work done by
someone it trusts, cf. Branti,supra, at 518 (certain positions
in government employment implicate such a need for trust
that their award on the basis of party political affiliation is

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

justified), and to resort to the sanction of termination for
unsatisfactory performance.* Umbehr, on the other hand,
argues that the government interests in maintaining harmonious working environments and relationships recognized in
our government employee cases are attenuated where the
contractor does not work at the government's workplace
and does not interact daily with government officers and employees. He also points out that to the extent that he is
publicly perceived as an independent contractor, any government concern that his political statements will be confused
with the government's political positions is mitigated. The
Board and the dissent, post, at 697-699, retort that the cost
of fending off litigation, and the potential for government
contracting practices to ossify into prophylactic rules to
avoid potential litigation and liability, outweigh the interests
of independent contractors, who are typically less financially
dependent on their government contracts than are government employees.
Each of these arguments for and against the imposition of
liability has some force. But all of them can be accommodated by applying our existing framework for government
employee cases to independent contractors. Mt. Healthy assures the government's ability to terminate contracts so long
as it does not do so in retaliation for protected First Amendment activity. Pickering requires a fact-sensitive and deferential weighing of the government's legitimate interests.
*The Board also asserts that state and local government decisions on
individual contracts are insulated by the Tenth Amendment or legislative
immunity from constitutional scrutiny and liability. See Brief for Petitioner 23-26, 37. The Tenth Amendment claim was not raised in its petition, so we do not address it. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). Because only
claims against the Board members in their official capacities are before us,
and because immunity from suit under § 1983 extends to public servants
only in their individual capacities, see, e. g., Leatherman v. Tarrant
County Narcotics Intelligence and CoordinationUnit, 507 U. S. 163, 166
(1993), the legislative immunity claim is moot.

678

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
Opinion of the Court

The dangers of burdensome litigation and the de facto imposition of rigid contracting rules necessitate attentive application of the Mt. Healthy requirement of proof of causation and
substantial deference, as mandated by Pickering, Connick,
and Waters, to the government's reasonable view of its legitimate interests, but not a per se denial of liability. Nor can
the Board's and the dissent's generalization that independent
contractors may be less dependent on the government than
government employees, see post, at 696, justify denial of all
First Amendment protection to contractors. The tests that
we have established in our government employment cases
must be judicially administered with sensitivity to governmental needs, but First Amendment rights must not be
neglected.
Umbehr's claim that speech threatens the government's
interests as contractor less than its interests as employer
will also inform the application of the Pickering test. Umbehr is correct that if the Board had exercised sovereign
power against him as a citizen in response to his political
speech, it would be required to demonstrate that its action
was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental
interest. But in this case, as in government employment
cases, the Board exercised contractual power, and its interests as a public service provider, including its interest in
being free from intensive judicial supervision of its daily
management functions, are potentially implicated. Deference is therefore due to the government's reasonable assessments of its interests as contractor.
We therefore see no reason to believe that proper application of the Pickering balancing test cannot accommodate the
differences between employees and independent contractors.
There is ample reason to believe that such a nuanced
approach, which recognizes the variety of interests that may
arise in independent contractor cases, is superior to a
bright-line rule distinguishing independent contractors from
employees. The bright-line rule proposed by the Board and

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

the dissent would give the government carte blanche to terminate independent contractors for exercising First Amendment rights. And that bright-line rule would leave First
Amendment rights unduly dependent on whether state law
labels a government service provider's contract as a contract
of employment or a contract for services, a distinction which
is at best a very poor proxy for the interests at stake. See
Comment, Political Patronage in Public Contracting, 51
U. Chi. L. Rev. 518, 520 (1984) ("[N]o legally relevant distinction exists between employees and contractors in terms
either of the government's interest in using patronage or of
the employee or contractor's interest in free speech"); cf.
Perry, 408 U. S., at 597 (the prohibition of unconstitutional
conditions on speech applies "regardless of the public employee's contractual or other claim to a job"). Determining
constitutional claims on the basis of such formal distinctions,
which can be manipulated largely at the will of the government agencies concerned, see Logue v. United States, 412
U. S.521, 532 (1973) (noting that independent contractors are
often employed to perform "tasks that would ... otherwise
be performed by salaried Government employees"), is an
enterprise that we have consistently eschewed. See, e. g.,
Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S.70, 83 (1973) (in the context of
the privilege against self-incrimination, "[w]e fail to see a
difference of constitutional magnitude between the threat of
job loss to an employee of the State, and a threat of loss of
contracts to a contractor"); cf. ColoradoRepublican Federal
Campaign Comm. v. FederalElection Comm'n, ante, at 622
(opinion of BREYER, J.) ("[T]he government 'cannot foreclose
the exercise of [First Amendment] rights by mere labels' ")
(quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S.415, 429 (1963)); Escobedo v. Illinois,378 U. S.478,486 (1964) (declining to "exalt
form over substance" in determining the temporal scope of
Sixth Amendment protections); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.
22, 53 (1932) ("[Rlegard must be had,... in... cases where
constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere matters of form

680

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR

Opinion of the Court

but to the substance of what is required"); Chicago, B. & Q.
R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 235 (1897) ("In determining

what is due process of law regard must be had to substance,
not to form"); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v.
Kelco Disposal,Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 299 (1989) (O'CONNOR, J.,

concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[T]he applicability of a provision of the Constitution has never depended on
the vagaries of state or federal law").
Furthermore, the arguments made by both parties demonstrate that it is far from clear, as a general matter, whether
the balance of interests at stake is more favorable to
the government in independent contractor cases than in
employee cases. Our unconstitutional conditions precedents
span a spectrum from government employees, whose close
relationship with the government requires a balancing of important free speech and government interests, to claimants
for tax exemptions, Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958),
users of public facilities, e. g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 390-394
(1993); Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972), and recipients of
small government subsidies, e. g., FCC v. League of Women
Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364 (1984), who are much less dependent on the government but more like ordinary citizens
whose viewpoints on matters of public concern the government has no legitimate interest in repressing. The First
Amendment permits neither the firing of janitors nor the
discriminatory pricing of state lottery tickets based on the
government's disagreement with certain political expression.
Independent contractors appear to us to lie somewhere between the case of government employees, who have the closest relationship with the government, and our other unconstitutional conditions precedents, which involve persons with
less close relationships with the government. The Board's
and the dissent's assertion, post, at 687, 696-697, that the
decision below represents an unwarranted "extension" of

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

special protections afforded to government employees is,
therefore, not persuasive.
B
1
The dissent's fears of excessive litigation, see post, at 697699, cannot justify a special exception to our unconstitutional
conditions precedent to deprive independent government
contractors of protection. Nor can its assertion that the allocation of government contracts on the basis of political bias
is a "long and unbroken tradition of our people." Post, at
688. We do not believe that tradition legitimizes patronage
contracting, regardless of whether one approaches the role
of tradition in First Amendment adjudication from the perspective of Part I of the Rutan dissent, see post, at 687 (quoting Rutan v. RepublicanParty of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 95 (1990)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting)) (a practice that "'bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic"'
is presumed constitutional) (emphasis added), or from that of
Justice Holmes, compare post, at 690 (quoting Holmes' discussion of traditional usage of legal terminology in a tax case)
with Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919)
(Holmes, J., dissenting) (rejecting both the self-interested
"logi[c]" and the long history of the suppression of free
speech, including the Sedition Act of 1798 and "the common
law as to seditious libel," in favor of the true "theory of our
Constitfition," which values free speech as essential to, not
subject to the vicissitudes of, our political system).
The examples to which the dissent cites, post, at 688-690,
are not, in our view, "'the stuff out of which the Court's
principles are to be formed,"' post, at 687 (quoting Rutan,
supra,at 96 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)). Consider, for example,
the practice of "courtroom patronage," whereby "[e]lected
judges, who owe their nomination and election to the party,
give the organization lucrative refereeships, trusteeships,

Politics 365, 367, 371 (1972) (similar), or the award of "gift[s]"

to political supporters under the guise of research grants,
Tolchin, supra, at 61, or the allocation of contracts based on
"contributions resulting from the compound of bribery and
extortion" and "kickbacks," A. Heard, The Costs of Democracy 143, 144 (1960), or the practice of "'beer politics,"'

whereby "wholesale liquor licenses issued by the state were
traded for campaign contributions," id., at 144, or the extortion of political support and "campaign contributions" on
pain of being branded a "Communist," R. Caro, The Power
Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York 726 (1975),
or the "favorable consideration in the courts or by public
agencies" expected in one city by the clients of "'political'
attorneys with part-time public jobs," Wolfinger, supra, at
389, or the question reportedly asked by a party official of a
businessman who was reluctant to contribute to a mayoralty
campaign, "'Look, you [expletive deleted], do you want a
snow-removal contract or don't you?,"' id., at 368. These
examples, cited by the dissent, many of which involve patronage in employment and appointments rather than in
contracting, cf. Comment, Political Patronage, at 518, n. 4
("[P]atronage systems have traditionally centered around
the distribution of government jobs" (emphasis added)), may
suggest that abuses of power in the name of patronage are
not "highly unusual," post, at 710. It may also be the case
that the victims whose speech is chilled and whose contributions are extracted by such government action are often
"'honorable and prudent businessmen."' Post, at 689 (quoting Heard, supra, at 145). But the dissent's examples do not
establish an "open and unchallenged" tradition of allocating
government contracts on the basis of political bias-much

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

less on the basis of disapproval of political speech. The dissent's own sources note that the patronage practices that
they report were denied and disavowed by their alleged
practitioners, see Wolfinger, supra, at 367, n. 2, 372-373,
n. 11, that they were most significant in secret and specialized contexts such as defense contracting that "operat[e] in
an atmosphere uninhibited by the usual challenges of representative government," Tolchin, supra, at 233, and that in
many cases they were illegal, see Heard, supra, at 143-144,
n. 4. We of course agree with the dissent that mere "obnoxious[ness]," post, at 690, and criminality do not make a practice unconstitutional. Nor, however, do the dissent's examples of covert, widely condemned, and sometimes illegal
government action legitimize the government discrimination
based on the viewpoint of one's speech or one's political affiliations that is involved here.
2
The dissent's own description of the "lowest-responsiblebidder" and other, similar requirements covering a wide
range of government contracts 'that the Federal Government, all 50 States, and many local government authorities,
have voluntarily adopted, see post, at 690-695, at least suggests that government contracting norms incompatible with
political bias have proliferated without unduly burdening the
government. In fact, lowest- and lowest-responsible-bidder
requirements have a long history, as a survey of 19th century
state constitutions and federal territorial legislation reveals.
See, e. g., Ala. Const., Art. IV, §30 (1875), in 1 Federal and
State Constitutions 161 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909); Civil Government in Alaska Act, Tit. I, §2 (1900), in id., at 243; Ark.

person shall be molested for his opinions on any subject
whatsoever, nor suffer any civil or political incapacity, or acquire any civil or political advantage, in consequence of such
opinions, except in cases provided for in this constitution").
We are aware of no evidence of excessive or abusive litigation under such provisions. And, unlike the dissent, post, at
699-700, we do not believe that a deferentially administered
requirement that the government not unreasonably terminate its commercial relationships on the basis of speech or
political affiliation poses a greater threat to legitimate government interests than the complex and detailed array of
modern statutory and regulatory government contracting
rules.
In sum, neither the Board nor Umbehr have persuaded
us that there is a "difference of constitutional magnitude,"
Lefkowitz, 414 U. S., at 83, between independent contractors and employees in this context. Independent government contractors are similar in most relevant respects to
government employees, although both the speaker's and the
government's interests are typically-though not alwayssomewhat less strong in the independent contractor case.

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

We therefore conclude that the same form of balancing analysis should apply to each.
III

Because the courts below assumed that Umbehr's termination (or nonrenewal) was in retaliation for his protected
speech activities, and because they did not pass on the balance between the government's interests and the free speech
interests at stake, our conclusion that independent contractors do enjoy some First Amendment protection requires
that we affirm the Tenth Circuit's decision to remand the
case. To prevail, Umbehr must show that the termination
of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter of
public concern, an initial showing that requires him to prove
more than the mere fact that he criticized the Board members before they terminated him. If he can make that showing, the Board will have a valid defense if it can show, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that, in light of their knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the time of the termination,
the Board members would have terminated the contract regardless of his speech. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977). The Board will also prevail if it
can persuade the District Court that the County's legitimate
interests as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the
free speech interests at stake. And, if Umbehr prevails,
evidence that the Board members discovered facts after termination that would have led to a later termination anyway,
and evidence of mitigation of his loss by means of his subsequent contracts with the cities, would be relevant in assessing what remedy is appropriate.
Finally, we emphasize the limited nature of our decision
today. Because Umbehr's suit concerns the termination of
a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government,
we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or
applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on
such a relationship.

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Subject to these limitations and caveats, however, we recognize the right of independent government contractors not
to be terminated for exercising their First Amendment
rights. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore,
affirmed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,

dissenting.*
Taken together, today's decisions in Board of Comm'rs,
Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, p. 668, and O'Hare Truck
Service, Inc. v. City of Northlake, post, p. 712, demonstrate
why this Court's Constitution-making process can be called
"reasoned adjudication" only in the most formalistic sense.
I
Six years ago, by the barest of margins, the Court expanded Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976), and Branti v.
Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), which had held that public employees cannot constitutionally be fired on the basis of their
political affiliation, to establish the new rule that applicants
for public employment cannot constitutionally be rejected on
the basis of their political affiliation. Rutan v. Republican
Partyof Ill., 497 U. S. 62 (1990). The four dissenters argued
that "the desirability of patronage is a policy question to
be decided by the people's representatives" and "a political
question if there ever was one." Id., at 104, 114 (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting). They were "convinced" that Elrod and Branti
had been "wrongly decided," 497 U. S., at 114; indeed, that
those cases were "not only wrong, not only recent, not only
contradicted by a long prior tradition, but also ... unworkable in practice" and therefore "should be overruled," id.,
*[This opinion applies also to No. 95-191, O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v.
City of Northlake, post, p. 712.]

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCALIA, J., dissenting

at 110-111. At the very least, the dissenters maintained,
Elrod and Branti "should not be extended beyond their
facts." 497 U. S., at 114.
Today, with the addition to the Court of another Justice
who believes that we have no basis for proscribing as unconstitutional practices that do not violate any explicit text ot
the Constitution and that have been regarded as constitutional ever since the framing, see, e. g., Bennis v. Michigan,
516 U. S. 442, 454-455 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring), one
would think it inconceivable that Elrod and Branti would
be extended far beyond Rutan to the massive field of all
government contracting. Yet amazingly, that is what the
Court does in these two opinions-and by lopsided votes, at
that. It is profoundly disturbing that the varying political
practices across this vast country, from coast to coast, can be
transformed overnight by an institution whose conviction of
what the Constitution means is so fickle.
The basic reason for my dissent today is the same as one
of the reasons I gave (this one not joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR) in Rutan:
"[W]hen a practice not expressly prohibited by the text
of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long
tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that
dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no
proper basis for striking it down. Such a venerable and
accepted tradition is not to be laid on the examining
table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstract
principle of First Amendment adjudication devised by
this Court. To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court's principles are
to be formed. They are, in these uncertain areas, the
very points of reference by which the legitimacy or illegitimacy of other practices is to be figured out. When
it appears that the latest 'rule,' or 'three-part test,' or
'balancing test' devised by the Court has placed us on a
collision course with such a landmark practice, it is the

688

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALIA, J., dissenting

former that must be recalculated by us, and not the latter that must be abandoned by our citizens. I know of
no other way to formulate a constitutional jurisprudence
that reflects, as it should, the principles adhered to, over
time, by the American people, rather than those favored
by the personal (and necessarily shifting) philosophical
dispositions of a majority of this Court." 497 U. S., at
95-96 (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).
There can be no dispute that, like rewarding one's allies,
the correlative act of refusing to reward one's opponentsand at bottom both of today's cases involve exactly that-is
an American political tradition as old as the Republic. This
is true not only with regard to employment matters, as Justice Powell discussed in his dissenting opinions in Elrod,
supra,at 377-379, and Branti, supra,at 522, n. 1, but also in
the area of government contracts, see, e. g., M. Tolchin &
S. Tolchin, To the Victor: Political Patronage from the Clubhouse to the White House 14-15, 61, 233-241, 273-277 (1971);
A. Heard, The Costs of Democracy 143-145 (1960); R. Caro,
The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York
723-726, 738, 740-741, 775, 799, 927 (1975); M. Royko, Boss:
Richard J. Daley of Chicago 69 (1971); Wolfinger, Why Political Machines Have Not Withered Away and Other Revisionist Thoughts, 34 J. Politics 365, 367-368, 372, 389 (1972); The
Bond Game Remains the Same, Nat. L. J., July 1, 1996,
pp. Al, A20-A21. If that long and unbroken tradition of our
people does not decide these cases, then what does? The
constitutional text is assuredly as susceptible of one meaning
as of the other; in that circumstance, what constitutes a "law
abridging the freedom of speech" is either a matter of history
or else it is a matter of opinion. Why are not libel laws such
an "abridgment"? The only satisfactory answer is that they
never were. What secret knowledge, one must wonder, is
breathed into lawyers when they become Justices of this
Court, that enables them to discern that a practice which the

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SOCAU, J., dissenting

text of the Constitution does not clearly proscribe, and which
our people have regarded as constitutional for 200 years, is
in fact unconstitutional?
The Court seeks to avoid the charge that it ignores the
centuries-old understandings and practices of our people by
recounting, Umbehr, ante, at 681-683, shocking examples of
raw political patronage in contracting, most of which would
be unlawful under the most rudimentary bribery law. (It
selects, of course, only the worst examples from the sources
I have cited, omitting the more common practices that permit one author to say, with undeniable accuracy, that "honorable and prudent businessmen competing for government
ventures make campaign contributions" out of "a desire to
do what [is] thought necessary to remain eligible," and that
"[m]any contractors routinely do so to both parties." Heard,
supra, at 145.) These "examples of covert, widely .condemned, and sometimes illegal government action,'" it says,
do not "legitimize the government discrimination." Umbehr, ante, at 683. But of course it is not the .county's or
city's burden (or mine) to "legitimize" all patronage practices; it is Umbehr's and O'Hare's (and the Court's) to show
that all patronage practices are not only "illegitimate" in
some vague moral or even precise legal sense, but that they
are unconstitutional. It suffices to demonstrate the error
of the Court's opinions that many contracting patronage
practices have been open, widespread, and unchallenged
since the beginning of the Republic; and that those that have
been objected to have not been objected to on constitutional
grounds. That the Court thinks it relevant that many patronage practices are "covert, widely condemned and sometimes illegal" merely displays its persistent tendency to
equate those many things that are or should be proscribed
as a matter of social policy with those few things that we
have the power to proscribe under the Constitution. The
relevant and inescapable point is this: No court ever held,

690

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALIA, J., dissenting

and indeed no one ever thought, prior to our decisions in
Elrod and Branti, that patronage contracting could violate
the FirstAmendment. The Court's attempt to contest this
point, or at least to becloud the issue, by appeal to obnoxious
and universally condemned patronage practices simply displays the feebleness of its case.
In each case today, the Court observes that we "have long
since rejected Justice Holmes' famous dictum, that a policeman 'may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he
has no constitutional right to be a policeman."' Umbehr,
ante, at 674 (quoting McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford,
155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N. E. 517 (1892)); see O'Hare,post, at
716-717 (quoting same). But this activist Court also repeatedly rejects a more important aphorism of Justice Holmes,
which expresses a fundamental philosophy that was once an
inseparable part of our approach to constitutional law. In a
case challenging the constitutionality of a federal estate tax
on the ground that it was an unapportioned direct tax in
violation of Article I, § 9, Justice Holmes wrote:
"[The] matter ...is disposed of... not by an attempt
to make some scientific distinction, which would be at
least difficult, but on an interpretation of language by its
traditional use-on the practical and historical ground
that this kind of tax always has .been regarded as the
antithesis of a direct tax ....
Upon this point a page
of history is worth a volume of logic." New York Trust
Co. v. Eisner,256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (emphasis added).
II
The Court's decision to enter this field cannot be justified
by the consideration (if it were ever a justification) that the
democratic institutions of government have not been paying
adequate attention to the problems it presents. The American people have evidently decided that political influence in
government contracting, like many other things that are

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCAIaA, J., dissenting

entirely constitutional, is not entirely desirable, and so they
have set about passing laws to prohibit it in some but not
all instances. As a consequence, government contracting is
subject to the most extraordinary number of laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels.
The United States Code contains a categorical statutory
prohibition on political contributions by those negotiating
for or performing contracts with the Federal Government,
2 U. S. C. §441c, competitive bidding requirements for contracts with executive agencies, 41 U. S. C. §§ 252-253, public corruption and bribery statutes, e.g., 18 U. S. C. § 201,
and countless other statutory requirements that restrict
Government officials' discretion in awarding contracts.
"There are already over four thousand individual statutory
provisions that affect the [Defense Department's] procurement process." Pyatt, Procurement Competition at Work:
The Navy's Experience, 6 Yale J. Reg. 319, 319-320 (1989).
Federal regulations are even more widespread. As one
handbook in the area has explained, "[t]heir procedural and
substantive requirements dictate, to an oftentimes astonishing specificity, how the entire contracting process will be conducted." ABA General Practice Section, Federal Procurement Regulations: Policy, Practice and Procedures 1 (1987).
That is why it is no surprise in this area to find a 253-page
book just setting forth "fundamentals," E. Massengale, Fundamentals of Federal Contract Law (1991), or a mere "deskbook" that runs 436 pages, ABA Section of Public Contract
Law, Government Contract Law: The Deskbook for Procurement Professionals (1995). Such "summaries" are indispensable when, for example, the regulations that constitute the
"Federal Acquisition Regulations System" total some 5,037
pages of fine print. See Title 48 CFR (1995).
Similar systems of detailed statutes and regulations exist
throughout the States. In addition to the various statutes
criminalizing bribes to government officials and other forms

692

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCAuIA, J., dissenting

of public corruption, all 50 States have enacted legislation
imposing competitive bidding requirements on various types
of contracts with the government.' Government contract1

ing is such a standard area for state regulation that a model
procurement code has been developed, which is set forth in
a 265-page book complete with proposed statutes, regulations, and explanations. See ABA Section of Urban, State
and Local Government Law, Model Procurement Code for
State and Local Governments (1981). As of 1989, 15 States
had enacted legislation based on the model code. See ABA
Section of Urban, State and Local Government Law, Annotations to the Model Procurement Code vii-viii (2d ed. 1992)
(and statutes cited).
By 1992, more than 25 local jurisdictions had also adopted
legislation based on the Model Procurement Code, see id., at
ix, and thousands of other counties and municipalities have
over time devised their own measures. New York City, for
example, which "[e]ach year... enter[s] into approximately
40,000 contracts worth almost $6.5 billion," has regulated the
public contracting process by a myriad of codes and regulations that seek to assure "scrupulous neutrality in choosing contractors and [consequently impose] multiple layers of
investigation and accountability." Anechiarico & Jacobs,

problems that arise in the area have been addressed, since
the founding of the Republic. See, e. g., Federal Procurement Regulations: Policy, Practice and Procedures, at 11-196
(describing the history of Federal Government procurement
regulation). But these laws and regulations have brought
to the field a degree of discrimination, discernment, and predictability that cannot be achieved by the blunt instrument
of a constitutional prohibition.
Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations would not contain the 5,000+ pages it does if it did not make fine distinctions, permitting certain actions in some Government acquisition areas and prohibiting them in others. Similarly, many
of the competitive bidding statutes that I have cited contain
exceptions for, or are simply written not to include, contracts
under a particular dollar amount,2 or those covering certain
subject matters, 3 or those that are time sensitive. 4 A politi2See, e. g., 41 U. S. C. §§ 252a(b), 403(11) (certain federal contracting laws

cal unit's decision not to enact contracting regulations, or to
suspend the regulations in certain circumstances, amounts
to a decision to permit some degree of political favoritism.
As I shall discuss shortly, O'Hare's and Umbehr's First
Amendment permits no such selectivity-or at least none
that can be known before litigation is over.
III
If inattention by the democratic organs of government is
not a plausible reason for the Court's entry into the field,
then what is? I believe the Court accepts (any sane person
must accept) the premise that it is utterly impossible to
erect, and enforce through litigation, a system in which no
citizen is intentionally disadvantaged by the government because of his political beliefs. I say the Court accepts that,
because the O'Hare opinion, in a rare brush with the real
world, points out that "O'Hare was not part of a constituency
that must take its chance of being favored or ignored in the
larger political process-for example, by residing or doing
business in a region the government rewards or spurns in
the construction of public works." Post, at 720-721. Of
course. Government favors those who agree with its political views, and disfavors those who disagree, every day-in
where it builds its public works, in the kinds of taxes it imposes and collects, in its regulatory prescriptions, in the design of its grant and benefit programs-in a million ways,
including the letting of contracts for government business.
What good reason has the Court given for separating out
this last way, and declaring it to be (as all the others for some
reason are not) an "abridgment of the freedom of speech"?
As I have explained, I would separate the permissible
from the impermissible on the basis of our Nation's traditions, which is what I believe sound constitutional adjudication requires. In Elrod and Branti,the Court rejected this
criterion-but if what it said did not make good constitutional law, at least it made some sense: the loss of one's job

696

is a powerful price to pay for one's politics. But the Court
then found itself on the fabled slippery slope that Justice
Holmes's aphorism about history and logic warned about: one
logical proposition detached from history leads to another,
until the Court produces a result that bears no resemblance
to the America that we know. The next step was Rutan,
which extended the prohibition of political motivation from
firing to hiring. The third step is today's Umbehr, which
extends it to the termination of a government contract.
And the fourth step (as I shall discuss anon) is today's
O'Hare, which extends it to the refusal to enter into contractual relationships.
If it is to be possible to dig in our cleats at some point on
this slope-before we end up holding that the First Amendment requires the city of Chicago to have as few potholes in
Republican wards (if any) as in Democratic ones-would not
the most defensible point of termination for this indefensible
exercise be public employment? A public employee is always an individual, and a public employee below the highest
political level (which is exempt from Elrod) is virtually always an individual who is not rich; the termination or denial
of a public job is the termination or denial of a livelihood.
A public contractor, on the other hand, is usually a corporation; and the contract it loses is rarely its entire business, or
even an indispensable part of its entire business. As Judge
Posner put it:
"Although some business firms sell just to government, most government contractors also have private
customers. If the contractor does not get the particular
government contract on which he bids, because he is on
the outs with the incumbent and the state does not have
laws requiring the award of the contract to the low bidder (or the laws are not enforced), it is not the end of
the world for him; there are other government entities
to bid to, and private ones as well. It is not like losing

SCAUA, J., dissenting

your job." LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d 292, 294
(CA7 1983).
Another factor that suggests we should stop this new enterprise at government employment is the much greater volume of litigation that its extension to the field of contracting
entails. The government contracting decisions worth litigating about are much more numerous than the number of
personnel hirings and firings in that category; and the litigation resources of contractors are infinitely more substantial
than those of fired employees or rejected applicants. Anyone who has had even brief exposure to the intricacies of
federal contracting law knows that a lawsuit is often used as
a device to stay or frustrate the award of a contract to a
competitor. See, e. g., Delta Data Systems Corp. v. Webster,
744 F. 2d 197 (CADC 1984); Delta Data Systems Corp. v.
Webster, 755 F. 2d 938 (CADC1985). What the Court's decisions today mean is that all government entities, no matter
how small, are at risk of § 1983 lawsuits for violation of constitutional rights, unless they adopt (at great cost in money
and efficiency) the detailed and cumbersome procedures that
make a claim of political favoritism (and a § 1983 lawsuit)
easily defended against.
The Court's opinion in O'Hareshrugs off this concern with
the response that "[w]e have no reason to believe that governments cannot bear a like burden [to that in the employment context] in defending against suits alleging the
denial of First Amendment freedoms to public contractors."
Post, at 724. The burden is, as I have suggested, likely
much greater than that in the employment context; and the
relevant question (if one rejects history as the determinant)
is not simply whether the governments "can bear" it, but
whether the inconvenience of bearing it is outbalanced by
the degree of abridgment of supposed First Amendment
rights (of corporate shareholders, for the most part) that

698

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALIA, J., dissenting

would occur if the burden were not imposed. 5 The Court
in Umbehr dismisses the risk of litigation, not by analogy
to the employment context, but by analogy to the many
government-contracting laws of the type I have discussed.
"We are aware," it says, "of no evidence of excessive
or abusive litigation under such provisions." Ante, at 684.
I am not sure the Court would be aware of such evidence
if it existed, but if in fact litigation has been "nonexcessive" (a conveniently imprecise term) under these provisions, that is scant indication that it will be "nonexcessive"
under the First Amendment. Uncertainty breeds litigation.
Government-contracting laws are clear and detailed, and
whether they have been violated is typically easy to as5 0'Hare makes a brief attempt to minimize
the seriousness of the litiga-

tion concern, pointing out that "[t]he amicus brief filed on behalf of respondents' position represehts that in the six years since our opinion in
[Rutan]. ..only 18 suits alleging First Amendment violations in employment decisions have been filed against Illinois state officials." Post, at
724. In fact the brief said "at least eighteen cases," Brief for Illinois
State Officials as Amici Curiae 3 (emphasis added), and that includes only
suits against state officials, and not those against the officials of Illinois'
102 counties or its even more numerous municipalities. Those statistics
pertain to employment suits, moreover-and as I have discussed, the contracting suits will be much more numerous.
O'Hare also says that "we have found no reported case in the Tenth
Circuit involving a First Amendment patronage claim by an independent
contractor in the six years since its Court of Appeals first recognized such
claims, see Abercrombie v. Catoosa,896 F. 2d 1228 (1990)." Post, at 724.
With respect, Abercrombie (which discussed this issue in two short paragraphs) was such an obscure case that even the District Court in Umbehr,
located in the Tenth Circuit, did not cite it, though it discussed cases in
other jurisdictions. Umbehr v. McClure, 840 F. Supp. 837 (Kan. 1993).
And when the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court, it did not do so
on the basis of Abercrombie-which, it noted, had "simply assumed that
an independent contractor could assert a First Amendment retaliation
claim" and had given "little reasoning" to the matter but merely so "suggested, without analysis." 44 F. 3d 876, 880 (1995) (emphasis added).
Abercrombie was, in short, such a muffled clarion that even the courts did
not hear it, much less the public at large.

SCALIA, J., dissenting

certain: the contract was put out for bid, or it was not.
Umbehr's new First Amendment, by contrast, requires a
sensitive "balancing" in each case; and the factual question
whether political affiliation or disfavored speech was the reason for the award or loss of the contract will usually be litigable. In short, experience under the government-contracting
laws has little predictive value.
The Court additionally asserts that the line cannot be
drawn between employment and independent contracting,
because "'the applicability of a provision of the Constitution
has never depended on the vagaries of state or federal law."'
Umbehr, ante, at 680 (quoting Browning-Ferris Industries
of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 299 (1989)
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part));
see also Umbehr, ante, at 678-680 (citing other cases). That
is not so. State law frequently plays a dispositive role in
the issue whether a constitutional provision is applicable.
In fact, before we invented the First Amendment right not
to be fired for political views, most litigation in this very field
of government employment revolved around the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause and asked whether the
firing had deprived the plaintiff of a "property" interest
without due process. And what is a property interest entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection? "[P]roperty
interests," we said, "are not created by the Constitution.
Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by
existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law .... If it is the law of Texas
that a teacher in the respondent's position has no contractual
or other claim to job tenure, the respondent's [federal constitutional] claim would be defeated." ' Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593, 602, n. 7 (1972) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted). See also Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280-281 (1977) (whether a government
entity possesses Eleventh Amendment immunity "depends,

700

BOARD OF COIM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
ScALIA, J., dissenting

at least in part, upon the nature of the entity created by
state law").

I have spoken thus far as though the only problem involved
here were a practical one: as though, in the best of all possible worlds, if our judicial system and the resources of our
governmental entities could only manage it, it would be desirable for an individual to suffer no disadvantagewhatever
at the hands of the government solely because of his political
views-no denial of employment, no refusal of contracts, no
discrimination in social programs, not even any potholes.
But I do not believe that. The First Amendment guarantees that you and I can say and believe whatever we like
(subject to a few tradition-based exceptions, such as obscenity and "fighting words") without going to jail or being fined.
What it ought to guarantee beyond that is not at all the
simple question the Court assumes. The ability to discourage eccentric views through the mild means that have historically been employed, and that the Court has now set its face
against, may well be important to social cohesion. To take
an uncomfortable example from real life: An organization (I
shall call it the White Aryan Supremacist Party, though that
was not the organization involved in the actual incident I
have in mind) is undoubtedly entitled, under the Constitution, to maintain and propagate racist and antisemitic views.
But when the Department of Housing and Urban Development lets out contracts to private security forces to maintain
law and order in units of public housing, must it really treat
this bidder the same as all others? Or may it determine
that the views of this organization are not political views
that it wishes to "subsidize" with public funds, nor political
views that it wishes to hold up as an exemplar of the law to
the residents of public housing?
The state and local regulation I described earlier takes
account of this reality. Even where competitive-bidding requirements are applicable (which is far from always), they
almost invariably require that a contract be awarded not to

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)

'6
the lowest bidder but to the "lowest responsible bidder."
"The word, 'responsible' is as important as the word 'lowest,"' H. Cohen, Public Construction Contracts and the Law
81 (1961), and has been interpreted in some States to permit
elected officials to exercise political discretion. "Some New
York courts," for example, "have upheld agency refusals to
award a contract to a low bidder because the contractor,
while technically and financially capable, was not morally responsible." Anechiarico & Jacobs 146-147. In the leading
case of Picone v. New York, 176 Misc. 967, 29 N. Y. S. 2d 539
(Sup. Ct. N. Y. Cty. 1941), the court stated that in determining whether a lowest bidder for a particular contract was
the "lowest responsible bidder," New York City officials had
permissibly considered "whether [the bidder] possessed integrity and moral worth." Id., at 969, 29 N. Y. S. 2d, at 541.
The New Jersey Supreme Court has similarly said: "It is
settled that the legislative mandate that a bidder be 'responsible' embraces moral integrity just as surely as it embraces
a capacity to supply labor and materials." Trap Rock Industries, Inc. v. Kohl, 59 N. J. 471, 481, 284 A. 2d 161, 166
(1971). In the future, presumably, this will be permitted
only if the disfavored moral views of the bidder have never
been verbalized, for otherwise the First Amendment will
produce entitlement to the contract, or at least guarantee
a lawsuit.
In treading into this area, "we have left the realm of law
and entered the domain of political science." Rutan, 497
U. S., at 113 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). As Judge Posner
rightly perceived, the issue that the Court today disposes of
like some textbook exercise in logic "raises profound questions of political science that exceed judicial competence to
answer." LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d, at 294.

IV

If, however, the Court is newly to announce that it has
discovered that the granting or withholding of a contract is
a First Amendment issue, a coherent statement of the new
law is the least that those who labor in the area are entitled

to expect. They do not get it from today's decisions, which
contradict each other on a number of fundamental points.
The decision in Umbehr appears to be an improvement on
our Elrod-Branti-Rutantrilogy in one sense. Rutan, the
most recent of these decisions, provided that the government
could justify patronage employment practices only if it
proved that such patronage was "narrowly tailored to further vital governmental interests." 497 U. S., at 74. The
four of us in dissent explained that "[tihat strict-scrutiny
standard finds no support in our cases," and we argued that,
if the new constitutional right was to be invented, the criterion for violation should be "the test announced in Pickering [v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,
Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968)]." Id., at 98, 100 (opinion of
SCALIA, J.). It thus appears a happy development that the
Court in Umbehr explicitly rejects the suggestion, urged by
Umbehr and by the United States as amicus curiae,that "on
proof of viewpoint-based retaliation for contractors' political
speech, the government should be required to justify its actions as narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest," ante, at 676; accord, ante, at 678, and instead holds "that
the Pickering balancing test, adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines the extent of [independent contractors'] protection"
under the First Amendment, ante, at 673. Pickering balancing, of course, requires a case-by-case assessment of the
government's and the contractor's interests. "Pickering
and its progeny.., involve a post hoc analysis of one employee's speech and its impact on that employee's public responsibilities." United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.
454, 466-467 (1995). See also id., at 480-481 (O'CONNOR,

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCAL A, J., dissenting

J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)
(Pickering requires "case-by-case application"); Rankin v.
McPherson,483 U. S. 378, 388-392 (1987); Connick v. Myers,
461 U. S. 138, 150-154 (1983); Pickering v. Board of Ed. of
Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563,
568-573 (1968). It is clear that this is what the Court's opinion in Umbehr anticipates: "a fact-sensitive and deferential
weighing of the government's legitimate interests," ante, at
677 (emphasis added), which accords "[d]eference... to the
government's reasonable assessments of its interests as contractor," ante, at 678 (emphasis deleted). "[S]uch a nuanced
approach," Umbehr says, "which recognizes the variety of
interests that may arise in independent contractor cases, is
superior to a bright-line rule." Ibid.
What the Court sets down in Umbehr, however, it rips up
in O'Hare. In Part III of that latter opinion, where the
Court makes its application of the First Amendment to the
facts of the case, there is to be found not a single reference
to Pickering. See post, at 720-726. Indeed, what is quite
astonishing, the Court concludes that it "need not inquire"
into any government interests that patronage contracting
may serve-even generally, much less in the particular case
at hand-"for Elrod and Branti establish that patronage
does not justify the coercion of a person's political beliefs and
associations." Post, at 718. Leaving aside that there is no
coercion here,7 the assertion obviously contradicts the need
for "balancing" announced in the companion Umbehr decision. This rejection of "balancing" is evident elsewhere in
O'Hare-aswhen the Court rejects as irrelevant the Seventh
7As

the dissenters in Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62

(1990), agreed: "[I]t greatly exaggerates [the constraints entailed by patronage] to call them 'coercion' at all, since_we generally make a distinction
between inducement and compulsion. The public official offered a bribe
is not 'coerced' to violate the law, and the private citizen offered a patronage job is not 'coerced' to work for the party." Id., at 109-110 (ScALA,
J., dissenting).

704

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCAUA, J., dissenting

Circuit's observation in LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d 292
(1983), that some contractors elect to "curr[y] favor with
diverse political parties," on the ground that the fact
"[t]hat some citizens [thus] find a way to mitigate governmental overreaching, or refrain from complaining,
does not excuse wrongs done to those who exercise their
rights." Post, at 724. But whether the government action
at issue here is a "wrong" is precisely the issue in this
case, which we thought (per Umbehr) was to be determined
by "balancing."
One would have thought these two opinions the products
of the courts of last resort of two different legal systems,
presenting fertile material for a comparative-law course on
freedom of speech were it not for a single paragraph in
O'Hare, a veritable deus ex machinaof legal analysis, which
reconciles the irreconcilable. The penultimate paragraph of
that portion of the O'Hare opinion which sets forth the general principles of law governing the case, see post, at 719,
advises that henceforth "the freedom of speech" alluded to
in the Bill of Rights will be divided into two categories: (1)
the "right of free speech," where "we apply the balancing
test from Pickering," and (since this "right of free speech"
presumably does not exhaust the Free Speech Clause) (2)
"political affiliation," where we apply the rigid rule of Elrod
and Branti. The Court (or at least the O'Hare Court) says
that "[t]here is an advantage in so confining the inquiry
where political affiliation alone is concerned, for one's beliefs
and allegiances ought not to be subject to probing or testing
by the government." Post, at 719.
Frankly, the only "advantage" I can discern in this novel
distinction is that it provides some explanation (no matter
how difficult to grasp) of how these two opinions can issue
from the same Court on the same day. It raises many questions. Does the "right of free speech" (category (1), that
is) come into play if the contractor not only is a Republican,
but says, "I am a Republican"? (At that point, of course,

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCALIA,

705

J., dissenting

the fatal need for "probing or testing" his allegiance disappears.) Or is the "right of free speech" at issue only if he
goes still further, and says, "I believe in the principles set
forth in the Republican platform"? Or perhaps one must
decide whether the Rubicon between the "right of free
speech" and the more protected "political affiliation" has
been crossed on the basis of the contracting authority's motivation, so that it does not matter whether the contractor
says he is a Republican, or even says that he believes in the
Republican platform, so long as the reason he is disfavored is
simply that (whatever he says or believes) he is a Republican.
But the analysis would change, perhaps, if the contracting
authority really has nothing against Republicans as such, but
can't stand people who believe what the Republican platform
stands for. Except perhaps it would not change if the contractor never actually said he was a Republican-or perhaps
only if he never actually said that he believed in the Republican platform. The many variations will provide endless
diversion for the courts of appeals.
If one is so sanguine as to believe that facts involving the
"right of free speech" and facts involving "political affiliation" can actually be segregated into separate categories,
there arises, of course, the problem of what to do when both
are involved. One would expect the more rigid test (Elrod
nonbalancing) to prevail. That is certainly what happens
elsewhere in the law. If one is categorically liable for a defamatory statement, but liable for a threatening statement
only if it places the subject in immediate fear of physical
harm, an utterance that combines both ("Sir, I shall punch
you in your lying mouth!") would be (at least as to the defamatory portion) categorically actionable. Not so, however,
with our new First Amendment law. Where, we are told,
"specific instances of the employee's speech or expression,
which require balancing in the Pickering context, are intermixed with a political affiliation requirement," balancing

706

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALiA, J., dissenting

rather than categorical liability will be the result. O'Hare,
post, at 719.
Were all this confusion not enough, the explanatory paragraph makes doubly sure it is not setting forth any comprehensible rule by adding, immediately after its description of
how Elrod, rather than the Pickeringbalancing test, applies
in "political affiliation" cases, the following- "It is true, on
the other hand,... that the inquiry is whether the affiliation
requirement is a reasonable one, so it is inevitable that some
case-by-case adjudication will be required even where political affiliation is the test the government has imposed."
O'Hare,post, at 719. As I said in Rutan, "[w]hat that means
is anybody's guess." 497 U. S., at 111 (dissenting opinion).
Worse still, we learn that O'Hareitself, where the Court does
not conduct balancing, may "perhaps [be] includ[ed]" among
"those many cases ... which require balancing" because it
is one of the "intermixed" cases I discussed in the paragraph
immediately above. Post, at 719. Why, then, one is inclined to ask, did not the Court conduct balancing?
The answer is contained in the next brief paragraph of the
O'Hare opinion:
"The Court of Appeals, based on its understanding of
the pleadings, considered this simply an affiliation case,
and held, based on Circuit precedent, there was no constitutional protection for one who was simply an outside
contractor. We consider the case in those same terms,
but we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion."
Post, at 720.
This is a deus ex machina sent in to rescue the Court's deus
ex machina, which was itself overwhelmed by the plot of
this tragedy of inconsistency. Unfortunately, this adjutor
adjutoris (to overextend, perhaps, my classical analogy) is
also unequal to the task: The respondent in this case is entitled to defend the judgment in its favor on the basis of the
facts as they were alleged, not as the Court of Appeals took

I Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCALA, J., dissenting

them to be. When, as here, "the decision we review adjudicated a motion to dismiss, we accept all of the factual allegations in petitioners' complaint as true and ask whether, in
these circumstances, dismissal of the complaint was appropriate." Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U. S. 531, 540 (1988)
(emphasis added). It is at least highly arguable that the
complaint alleged what the Court calls a violation of the
"right of free speech" rather than merely the right of "political affiliation." The count at issue was entitled "FREEDOM
OF SPEECH," see App. in No. 95-191, p. 15, and contended
that petitioners had been retaliated against because of "the
exercise of their constitutional right of freedom of speech,"
id., at 17. One of the two central factual allegations is the
following- "John A. Gratzianna openly supported Paxson's
opponent for the office of Mayor. Campaign posters for Paxson's opponent were displayed at plaintiff O'Hare's place of
business." Id., at 16. It is particularly inexcusable to hide
behind the Court of Appeals' treatment of this litigation as
"simply an affiliation case," since when the Court of Appeals
wrote its opinion the world had not yet learned that the Free
Speech Clause is divided into the two categories of "right of
free speech" and "political affiliation." As far as that court
knew, it could have substituted "freedom of speech" for "freedom of political affiliation" whenever it used the term, with
no effect on the outcome. It did not, in other words, remotely make a "finding" that the case involves only the right
of political affiliation. Unavoidably, therefore, if what the
O'Hare Court says in its first explanatory paragraph is to
be believed-that is, what it says in the latter part of that
paragraph, to the effect that "intermixed" cases are governed by Pickering-thereis simply no basis for reversing
the Court of Appeals without balancing, and directing that
the case proceed, effectively depriving the city of its right to
judgment on the pleadings.
Unless, of course, Pickering balancing can never support
the granting of a motion to dismiss. That is the proposition

708

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALIA,

J., dissenting

that today's O'Hare opinion, if it is not total confusion, must
stand for. Nothing else explains how the Court can (1) assert that an "intermixed" case requires Pickering balancing,
(2) acknowledge that the complaint here may set forth an
"intermixed" case, and yet (3) reverse the dismissal without
determining whether the complaint does set forth an "intermixed" case and, if so, proceeding to conduct at least a preliminary Pickeringbalancing. There is of course no reason
in principle why this particular issue should be dismissal
proof, and the consequence of making it so, given the burdens
of pretrial discovery (to say nothing of trial itself) will be to
make litigation on this subject even more useful as a device
for harassment and weapon of commercial competition. It
must be acknowledged, however, that proceeding this way in
the present case has one unquestionable advantage: it leaves
it entirely to the District Court to clean up, without any
guidance or assistance from us, the mess that we have
made-to figure out whether saying "Vote against Paxson,"
or "Paxson is a hack," or "Paxson's project for a 100,000-seat
municipal stadium is wasteful," or whatever else Mr. Gratzianna's campaign posters might have said, removes this case
from the Political Affiliation Clause of the Constitution and
places it within the Right of Free Speech Clause.
One final observation about the sweep of today's holdings.
The opinion in Umbehr, having swallowed the camel of First
Amendmeit extension into contracting, in its penultimate
paragraph demonstrates the Court's deep-down judicial conservatism by ostentatiously straining out the following gnat:
"Finally, we emphasize the limited nature of our decision
today. Because Umbehr's suit concerns the termination of
a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government,
we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or
applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on
such a relationship." Ante, at 685. The facts in Umbehr,
of course, involved the termination of nothing so vague as a
"commercial relationship with the government"; the Board

Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
SCALIA, J., dissenting

of Commissioners had terminated Umbehr's contract. The
fuzzier terminology is used, presumably, because O'Hare did
not involve termination of a contract. As far as appears,
O'Hare had not paid or promised anything to be placed on a
list of tow-truck operators who would be offered individual
contracts as they came up. The company had no right to
sue if the city failed to call it, nor the city any right to sue if
the company turned down an offered tow. It had, in short,
only what might be called (as an infinity of things might be
called) "a pre-existing commercial relationship" with the
city: it was one of the tow-truck operators they regularly
called. The quoted statement in Umbehr invites the bar to
believe, therefore, that the Court which declined to draw the
line of First Amendment liability short of firing from government employment (Elrod and Branti), short of nonhiring for
government employment (Rutan), short of termination of a
government contract (Umbehr), and short of denial of a government contract to someone who had a "pre-existing commercial relationship with the government" (O'Hare) may
take a firm stand against extending the Constitution into
every little thing when it comes to denying a government
contract to someone who had no "pre-existing commercial
relationship." Not likely; in fact, not even believable.
This Court has begun to make a habit of disclaiming
the natural and foreseeable jurisprudential consequences of
its pathbreaking (i. e., Constitution-making) opinions. Each
major step in the abridgment of the people's right to govern
themselves is portrayed as extremely limited or indeed sui
juris. In Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 632, 633 (1996),
announced last month, the Court asserted that the Colorado
constitutional amendment at issue was so distinctive that it
"defies ...conventional inquiry" and "confounds [the] normal
process of judicial review." In United States v. Virginia,
ante, at 534, n. 7, announced two days ago, the Court purported to address "specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized by the District Court and the Court of

710

BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE OTY. v. UMBEHR
SCALA,

J., dissenting

Appeals as 'unique."' And in the cases announced today,
"we emphasize the limited nature of our decision." Uiber,
ante, at 6&5. The people should not be deceived. While the
present Court sits, a major, undemocratic restructuring of
our national institutions and mores is constantly in progress.

They say hard cases make bad law. The cases before the
Court today set the blood boiling, with the arrogance that
they seem to display on the part of elected officials. Shall
the American System of Justice let insolent, petty-tyrant politicians get away with this? What one tends to forget is
-that we have heard only-the plaintiffs' tale. These suits
were dismissed before trial, so the "facts" the Court recites
in its opinions assume the truth of the allegations made (or
the preliminary evidence presented) by the plaintiffs. We
have no idea whether the allegations are true or false-but
if they are true, they are certainly highly unusual, Elected
officials do not thrive on arrogance.
For every extreme case of thg sort alleged here, I expect
there are thousands of contracts awarded on a "favoritism"
basis that no one would get excited about. The Democratic
mayor gives the city's municipal bond business to what is
known to be a solid Democratic law firm-taking it away
from the solid Republican law firm that had the business during the previous, Republican, administration. What else is
new? Or he declines to give the construction contract for.
the new municipal stadium to the company that opposed the
bond issue for its construction, and that in fact tried to get
the stadium built across the river in the next State. What
else would you expect? Or he awards the cable monopoly,
not to the (entirely responsible) Johnny-come-lately, but to
the local company that has always been a "good citizen"-which means it has supported with money, and the personal
efforts of its management, civic initiatives that the vast majority of the electorate favor, though some oppose. I-Moray!

Favoritism such as this happens all the time in American
political life, and no one has ever thought that it violatedof all things-the First Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States.
The Court must be living in another world. Day by
day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution for
a country I do not recognize. Depending upon which of
today's cases one chooses to consider authoritative, it has
either (O'Hare) thrown out vast numbers of practices that
are routine in American political life in order to get rid of
a few bad apples; or (Umbehr) with the same purpose in
mind subjected those routine practices to endless, uncertain, case-by-case, balance-all-the-factors-and-who-knowswho-will-win
