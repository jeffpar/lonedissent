MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 95-5661.

Argued February 27, 1996-Decided June 17, 1996

After agreeing with others to buy cocaine, petitioner was charged with a
conspiracy violative of 21 U. S. C. §846, which carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. He ultimately signed a plea
agreement providing, inter alia,that in return for his cooperation with
the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government
would move the sentencing court, pursuant to §5K1.1 of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines, to depart downward from the otherwise
applicable Guideline sentencing range, which turned out to be 135 to 168
months' imprisonment. Although the agreement noted the applicability
of the 10-year statutory minimum sentence, neither it nor the ensuing
§5K1.1 motion mentioned departure below that minimum. Pursuant to
the motion, the District Court departed downward from the Guideline
range in sentencing petitioner. It also ruled, however, that it had no
authority to depart below the statutory minimum because the Government had not made a motion, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(e), that it
do so. It thus sentenced petitioner to 10 years, and the Third Circuit
affirmed.
Held: A Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court
depart below the minimum of the applicable Guideline sentencing range
does not also authorize the court to depart below a lower statutory
minimum sentence. Pp. 124-131.
(a) Guideline §5K1.1 does not create a "unitary" motion system.
Title 18 U. S. C. §3553(e) requires a Government motion requesting or
authorizing the district court to "impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence" before the court may impose
such a sentence. Nothing in §3553(e) suggests that a district court has
the power to impose such a sentence when the Government has not
authorized it, but has instead moved for a departure only from the applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in § 3553(e) or 28 U. S. C.
§ 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with § 3553(e)'s
motion requirement or, alternatively, "deem" a motion requesting or
authorizing different action-such as a departure below the Guidelines
minimum-to be a motion authorizing departure below the statutory
minimum. Section 5K1.1 cannot be read as attempting to exercise this
nonexistent authority. That section states that "[u]pon motion of the

Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)
Syllabus
government... the court may depart from the guidelines," while its
Application Note 1 declares that "[u]nder circumstances set forth in...
§ 3553(e) and ...§994(n) ...substantial assistance... may justify a
sentence below a statutorily required minimum sentence." One of the
circumstances set forth in §3553(e) is that the Government has authorized the court to impose such a sentence. The Government is correct
that the relevant statutory provisions merely charge the Commission
with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific
sentence once the Government has moved for a departure below the
statutory minimum, not with "implementing" §3553(e)'s motion requirement, and that §5K1.1 does not improperly attempt to dispense with or
modify that requirement. Pp. 124-130.
(b) For two reasons, the Court need not decide whether the Government is correct in reading §994(n) to permit the Commission to construct a unitary motion system by providing that the district court may
depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing
to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if the
court finds that to be appropriate. First, even if the Commission had
done so, that would not help petitioner, since the Government has not
authorized a departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, the
Commission has not adopted this type of unitary system. Pp. 130-131.

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue here is whether a Government motion attesting
to the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court depart below
the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the
Sentencing Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below any statutory minimum sentence. We hold that
it does not.
JUSTICE THOMAS

I

Petitioner and several others entered into an agreement
to buy cocaine from confidential informants of the United
States Customs Service. As a result, petitioner was
charged with conspiring to distribute and to possess with
intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, see
§406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. §846, a crime
that carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years'
imprisonment, see §841(b)(1)(A). Plea negotiations ensued,
and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that in
return for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government would "move
the sentencing court, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the otherwise applicable
guideline range." App. 9. The agreement noted that the
offense to which petitioner would plead guilty "carries a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment." Id., at 6. The agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court to impose a sentence
below the statutory minimum, nor did it specifically state
that the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.
Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy. The
probation officer determined that the Guideline sentencing
range applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months'
imprisonment. In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance rendered by petitioner and moved the

Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

court to impose "a sentence lower than what the [c]ourt ha[d]
determined to be the otherwise applicable [sic] under the
sentencing guidelines." Id., at 13-14. The letter specifically noted that "[tihis motion is made pursuant to Section
5K1.l." Id., at 13. The Government did not request a sentence below the statutory minimum, although, again, it did
not state that the Government opposed such a departure.
The District Court granted the Government's motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by the
Guidelines. However, because the Government had not also
moved the District Court to depart below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(e), the court ruled that it
had no authority to so depart; it thus imposed the 10-year
minimum sentence required by statute.
On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court
had erred in concluding that it had no authority to depart
below the statutory minimum. A § 5K1.1 motion, he argued,
not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the Guidelines but also permits the court
to depart below a lower statutory minimum. See United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 5Kl.1,
p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). A divided panel of the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument and
affirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995). A petition for rehearing was denied, with six judges dissenting.
As we noted in Wade v. United States, 504 U. S. 181, 185
(1992), the Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance and requesting that the district court depart below
the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the
Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below
any statutory minimum.'
' Compare 55 F. 3d 130 (CA3 1995) and United States v. RodriguezMorales, 958 F. 2d 1441 (CA8), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 940 (1992), with

1994), and United States v. Keene, 933 F. 2d 711 (CA9 1991).

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 516 U. S.
963 (1995). We now hold that such a motion does not authorize a departure below a lower statutory minimum.
II
The question presented involves two subsections of federal
statutes and a policy statement of the Guidelines. Title 18
U. S. C. § 3553(e) provides:
"Limited authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum.-Upon motion of the Government, the
court shall have the authority to impose a sentence
below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance
in the investigation or prosecution of another person
who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be
imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code."
Title 28 U. S. C. §994(n), in turn, states:
"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower
sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including
a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or
prosecution of another person who has committed an
offense."
Finally, the text of § 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides:
"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (Policy
Statement)
"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has
committed an offense, the court may depart from the
guidelines.

Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

"(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by
the court for reasons stated that may include, but are
not limited to, consideration of the following: [List of
five factors for the court's consideration, including] the
government's evaluation of the assistance rendered."
Petitioner argues that § 5K1.1 creates what he calls a "unitary" motion system, in which a motion attesting to the substantial assistance of the defendant and requesting a departure below the Guidelines range also permits a district court
to depart below the statutory minimum. 2 The Government
views § 5Kl.1 as establishing a binary motion system, which
permits the Government to authorize a departure below the
Guidelines range while withholding from the court the authority to depart below a lower statutory minimum. The
parties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretations
of the system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commis3
sion were permissible ones under § 3553(e). and §994(n).
We believe that §3553(e) requires a Government motion
requesting or authorizing the district court to "impose a
sentence below a level established by statute as minimum
2Petitioner also argues for the first time in his reply brief that the plea
agreement into which he entered was at least ambiguous with respect to
whether it required the Government to move the District Court to depart
below the statutory minimum-and thus that the agreement itself permitted the court to depart below the 10-year minimum. See Reply Brief for
Petitioner 7-8. We do not view this issue as included within the question
upon which we granted certiorari, see Pet. for Cert. 3 ("Did the sentencing
court have the discretion to depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States moved for departure under USSG §5K1,
without the requirement of a second government departure application
under 18 U. S. C. 3553(e)?"), and petitioner appears to concede that it
is not, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. We therefore decline to address the
argument.
'Although it is plain that under §994(n), the Commission was at least
authorized to create a system in which no Government motion of any kind
need be filed before the district court may depart below the Guidelines
minimum, neither party argues that the Commission has created such a
system.

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

sentence" before the court may impose such a sentence. Petitioner and his amici repeatedly characterize the motion required by §3553(e) as a "motion that substantial assistance
has occurred," Brief for Petitioner 12, a "motion acknowledging the defendant's 'substantial assistance,"' id., at 8, and the
like. But the term "motion" generally means "[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a rule
or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant." Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed. 1990). 4 Papers
simply "acknowledging" substantial assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or consent to, a sentence below the statutory minimum.5
Of course, the Government did more than simply "acknowledge" substantial assistance here: It moved the court
to impose a sentence below the Guideline range. But we
agree with the Government that nothing in § 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power to impose a sentence
below the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's cooperation when the Government has not authorized such a sentence, but has instead moved for a departure only from the
applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in § 3553(e)
or § 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense
with § 3553(e)'s motion requirement or, alternatively, "deem"
4See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1254 (2d
ed. 1987) (defining '"motion" in the legal sense as "an application made to
a court or judge for an order, ruling, or the like"); Wade v. United States,
504 U. S. 181, 187 (1992) ("[Substantial assistance] is a necessary condition
for [a departure, but] it is not a sufficient one. The Government's decision
not to move may have been based not on a failure to acknowledge or
appreciate [the defendant's] help, but simply on its rational assessment of
the cost and benefit that would flow from moving").
5We do not mean to imply, of course, that specific language (such as that
quoted in text) or, on the other hand, an express reference to §3553(e) is
necessarily required before a court may depart below the statutory minimum. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, 18, 32, 34 (characterizing the opposing
argument in this fashion). But the Government must in some way indicate its desire or consent that the court depart below the statutory minimum before the court may do so.

Opinion of the Court

a motion requesting or authorizing different action-such as
a departure below the Guidelines minimum-to be a motion
authorizing the district court to depart below the statutory
minimum.
Moreover, we do not read § 5Kl.1 as attempting to exercise
this nonexistent authority. Section 5K1.1 says: "Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance ...

the court may depart from

the guidelines," while its Application Note 1 says: "Under
circumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C. §3553(e) and 28 U. S. C.
§ 994(n)... substantial assistance... may justify a sentence
below a statutorily required minimum sentence," § 5K1.1,
comment., n. 1. One of the circumstances set forth in
§3553(e) is, as we have explained previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a sentence below
the statutory minimum.
Petitioner and his amici argue that §3553(e) requires a
sentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in
"accordance" with the Guidelines; that § 994(n) specifically directs the Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases, including cases in which a sentence
below a statutory minimum is warranted; and that if § 5K1.1
is not read as creating a unitary motion system, then the
Commission has improperly failed to meet its obligation,
because no other provision of the Guidelines implements
§3553(e) and §994(n). They also argue (1) that the reference
to §3553(e) in §SKl.1's Application Note 1 indicates that
§ 5K1.1 is a "conduit" established by the Commission for "implementation" of § 3553(e); (2) that Application Note 2's use
of the broad term "sentencing reduction," rather than "departure from the guidelines range," supports petitioner's
view that §5Kl.1 authorizes departures below a statutory
minimum; 6 (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on
6

Application Note 2 provides in relevant part: "The sentencing reduction for assistance to authorities shall be considered independently of any
reduction for acceptance of responsibility." USSG § 5K1.1, comment., n. 2.

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

the assumption that the district court retains "full discretionary power" over the extent of the sentencing reduction
(i. e., the authority to choose any sentence once the Government makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance); 7 (4) that the reference to §SK1.1 alone
(rather than to §3553(e)) in USSG § 2D1.I's Application Note
7 further supports petitioner's claim that §5Kl.1 is a conduit
for implementation of §3553(e); 8 and (5) that if the factors
described in §5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretion
do not apply to sentences imposed after the Government
moves to depart below the statutory minimum, then the
district court's discretion will be wholly unlimited in those
circumstances.
In the Government's view, § 3553(e) already gives the district court authority to depart below the statutory minimum
on motion to do so by the prosecutor. The Government
urges us to read the last sentence of §3553(e), and the
inclusion of the phrase "including a sentence that is lower
than that established by statute as a minimum sentence" in
§ 994(n), as merely requiring the Commission to constrain the
district court's discretion in choosing a sentence after the
Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum.
The Government contends that the first paragraph of § 5K1.1
does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum,
but that §5K1.l(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the
7

Application Note 3 provides: "Substantial weight should be given to
the government's evaluation of the extent of the defendant's assistance,
particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to
ascertain." USSG §5K1.l, comment., n. 3.
8
Application Note 7 provides in pertinent part: "Where a mandatory

(statutory) minimum sentence applies, this mandatory minimum sentence
may be 'waived' and a lower sentence imposed (including a sentence below
the applicable guideline range), as provided in 28 U. S. C. § 994(n), by reason of a defendant's 'substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.' See §5K1.1
(Substantial Assistance to Authorities)." USSG §2D1.I, comment., n. 7.
Section 2D1.1 is a Guideline addressed to a variety of drug offenses.

Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum
(as well as to sentences imposed after the Government
moves to depart below the Guidelines range); §5KL.1(a) thus
implements the requirements of §3553(e) and §994(n) that
relate to sentences below the statutory minimum, by requiring the district court to consider the factors listed in
§§ 5K1.1(a)(1)-(5) in determining the appropriate extent of
a departure below the statutory minimum. According to
the Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by petitioner vanish once §5Kl.l(a) is so construed.
We agree with the Government that the relevant parts of
the statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific sentence after the Government moves for a departure below the
statutory minimum.9 Congress did not charge the Commission with "implementing" §3553(e)'s Government motion
requirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining the
district court's discretion regarding the particular sentence
selected.
Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by the parties could certainly be clearer, we also believe that the Government's interpretation of the current
provisions is the better one. Section 5K1.1(a) may guide the
district court when it selects a sentence below the statutory
minimum, as well as when it selects a sentence below the
Guidelines range."' The Commission has not, however, im9Notably, §3553(e) states that the "sentence" shall be imposed in accordance with the Guidelines and policy statements, not that the "departure"
shall occur, or shall be authorized, in accordance with the Guidelines and
policy statements.
10 Section §5Kl.1(a) may apply of its own force to sentences below the
statutory minimum, see ibid. (providing that the district court shall determine "[t]he appropriate reduction" by applying a nonexhaustive list
of factors), and both the reference to §3553(e) in §5Kl.1s Application
Note 1 and the reference to §5K1.1 in §2Dl.1's Application Note 7 may
reflect that fact. Or perhaps the phrase "[t]he appropriate reduction"y in
§ 5K1.1(a) encompasses only departures below the Guidelines range, but

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

properly attempted to dispense with or modify the requirement for a departure below the statutory minimum spelled
out in § 3553(e)-that of a Government motion requesting or
authorizing a departure below the statutory minimum.
The Government has made no such motion here. Hence,
the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked the
authority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years'
imprisonment.
III

What is at stake in the long run is whether the Government can make a motion authorizing the district court to
depart beloW the Guidelines range but withholding from the
district court the power to depart below the statutory minimum. Although the Government contends correctly that
the Commission does not have authority to "deem" a Government motion that does not authorize a departure below the
statutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the Government apparently reads §994(n) to permit
the Commission to construct a unitary motion system by adjusting the requirements for a departure below the Guidelines minimum-that is, by providing that the district court
may depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below the
statutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-31.
We need not decide whether the Commission could create
this second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons.
First, even if the Commission had done so, that would not
help petitioner, since the Government has not authorized a
departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, we
agree with the Government that the Commission has not
adopted this type of unitary motion system. Neither the
the Application Notes are meant to suggest that the court should also
consider the §5Kl.1(a) factors in the analogous circumstance of a departure below the statutory minimum.

text of §5K1.1 nor its commentary expressly limits the authority of the court to depart below the Guidelines minimum
to situations in which the Government has moved to depart
below the statutory minimum. The text of § 5K1.1 says:
"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant
has provided substantial assistance..., the court may depart from the guidelines." We do not read this sentence to
say: "Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance.., and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any,
the court may depart from the guidelines." Rather, we read
it as permitting the district court to depart below the Guidelines range when the Government states that the defendant
has provided substantial assistance and requests or authorizes the district court to depart below the Guidelines range.

concurring.
I agree with the conclusion that 18 U. S. C. § 3553(e) requires a motion by the Government asking the district court
to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, but I
part company with the Court on the characterization of the
policy statement numbered §5K1.1, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995)
(USSG). The text of this policy statement deals with departures from the Guidelines; the best reading of each sentence
is that its referent is a Guideline departure, and that neither
directly applies to reductions below mandatory minimums.
The Application Notes (which are "the legal equivalent of a
policy statement," USSG § 1B1.7)'are where the Sentencing
Commission has dealt with sentences below statutory minimums. In my view, the Sentencing Commission has discharged its responsibility under 28 U. S. C. § 994(n) by its

inclusion of the Application Notes, which effectively tell district courts that the policy statement applies as well to motions for reductions below mandatory minimums. Thus, my
disagreement is over the suggestion that the two sentences
of § 5K1.1 can be treated separately. I would simply say
that the Application Notes indicate that § 5K1.1 applies to
motions under §3553(e), and leave it at that.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

concurring in the judgment.

Petitioner has persuaded me that the Sentencing Commission intended §5K1.1 to create a unitary motion system
under which any request for a departire.below the Guideline
range based on substantial assistance would also authorize a
departure below the statutory minimum. Such a system
would be eminently reasonable, but, for two reasons, I am
convinced that Congress did not intend to authorize it.
First, I agree with the Court that the text of §3553(e) does
not authorize the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum unless the Government has made a motion
requesting that relief. Second, notwithstanding my serious
doubts concerning the wisdom of a congressional decision to
impose statutory minimum sentences higher than those considered appropriate by the Commission, the very fact that
Congress has done so indicates that it intended to confer the
authority to dispense with the statutory minima on the
prosecutor rather than the Commission.
Thus, I concur in the judgment because I agree with the
Court's interpretation of § 3553(e).
JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, for, like the
Court, I believe the Commission does not have the power to
modify Congress' statutes. I disagree with Part III, however, because the Commission does have the power to write
its own Guidelines and, in my view, the Commission has in

Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)
Opinion of BREYER, J.

fact exercised that power to create what the Court calls a
"unitarymotion system."
To understand that system, one must keep in mind two
facts. First, many "substantial assistance" departures involve departures only from Guideline sentences, not from
statutory mandatory minimum sentences. When a defendant seeks a "substantial assistance" departure from the minimum Guideline sentence for robbery, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, or most other offenses, the defendant need
not worry about a statutorily required minimum sentence,
for either no such minimum sentence applies, or that sentence is so far below the minimum Guideline sentence that
there is no practical likelihood of a departure drastic enough
to make it relevant. The Guidelines govern departures from
these Guideline sentences, and they permit judges to depart
downward for "substantial assistance" only if the Government makes a "motion ... stating that the defendant has
provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense."
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual
§5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). I call the policy statement
that sets forth this rule the "Substantial Assistance
Guideline."
Second, some criminal convictions implicate not only the
Guidelines, but also the special statutes (applicable particularly to drug and weapon offenses) that set "mandatory minimum" sentences. See United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal
Justice System, App. A, pp. A1-A8 (Aug. 1991) (Mandatory
Minimum Penalties). The law does not normally permit a
departure below such mandatory statutory minimums. But
cf. 18 U. S. C. §3553(f) (limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases); USSG §5C1.2 (same). The
law does permit such a departure, however, for one special'
reason, namely, "substantial assistance," but only if the Government makes a "motion ...so as to reflect a defendant's

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of BREYER, J.

substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of
another person who has committed an offense." 18 U. S. C.
§3553(e). I shall call the statute that states this rule the
"Substantial Assistance Statute."
With these two basic facts in mind, one might ask what
the Commission means by the term "substantial assistance"
in its Substantial Assistance Guideline. In particular, do
those words in that Guideline mean the same thing that
those same words mean in the Substantial Assistance Statute? Or does the Commission intend those words in its
Guideline to create a tougher, or perhaps a more lenient,
standard where departures from Guideline minimums
(rather than departures from statutory minimums) are at
issue?
The answer to this interpretive question, in my view, is
that the Commission means the term "substantial assistance" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline to create the
same standard that the Substantial Assistance Statute creates using the same words. As so interpreted, the Guideline
authorizes a sentencing judge to depart downward from a
Guideline sentence for substantial assistance only if the Government files the same kind of motion that the Government
would file to obtain a departure from a statutory minimum
sentence, were such a sentence at issue.
My reasons for believing that the Commission intended to
tie its Substantial Assistance Guideline to the Substantial
Assistance Statute (thereby recognizing one kind of "substantial assistance," not two) are the following: First, as I
have said, the language the Commission used to write its
Substantial Assistance Guideline is virtually identical to the
language that appears in the Substantial Assistance Statute.
Compare USSG §5K.1, p. s., with 18 U. S. C. §3553(e). Second, the Commission nowhere suggests that the key words
"substantial assistance" mean something different in the two
places (the Guideline and the Statute) where they appear,
and I cannot imagine any reason why the Commission would

Opinion of BREYER, J.

have wanted to create different standards through the use of
identical words, thereby creating additional administrative
complexity and risking unnecessary confusion. Third, the
Commission's commentary refers to statutory and guideline
departures indiscriminately. USSG § 2D1.1, comment., n. 7
(citing Substantial Assistance Guideline for proposition that
statutory minimum may be "waived"); see also Mandatory
Minimum Penalties, supra, at 59 (discussing unitary "substantial assistance motions").
The Court's reason for reaching the contrary conclusion is
that the Commission did not specify that courts could not
depart below a minimum Guideline sentence without a Government motion for departure below any applicable statutory minimum. That is, the Substantial Assistance Guideline does not say: "Upon motion of the government stating
that the defendant has provided substantial assistance...
and authorizingthe court to depart below the statutoryminimum, if any, the court may depart from the guidelines."
Ante, at 131 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not surprising that the Commission neglected
to add these words of crystal clarity to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, since that Guideline governs many cases
that have nothing to do with mandatory minimum sentences.
It makes sense, instead, for the Commission to have noted
the interplay of "substantial assistance" and statutory minimums in its commentary to the Substantial Assistance
Guideline, see USSG § 5Kl.1, p. s., comment., n. 1, and in its
section on drug offenses, for which statutory minimums are
relatively common, see id., § 2D1.1, comment., n. 7.
I recognize that the Court, through its interpretation of
the Guideline, avoids having to decide "whether the Commission could create this... unitary motion system." Ante, at
130. But the legal question it avoids is not a difficult one.
Congress delegated to the Commission broad authority to
determine when sentencing courts may reward substantial
assistance with a reduced sentence. See 28 U. S. C. § 994(n).

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of BREYER, J.

The Commission's exercise of delegated authority is normally lawful as long as it is reasonable. See, e. g., United
States v. Shabazz, 933 F. 2d 1029, 1035 (CADC) (Thomas, J.)
(citing Chevron U S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984)), cert. denied sub
nom. McNeil v. United States, 502 U. S. 964 (1991). And
a unitary system seems perfectly reasonable. Indeed, the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure recognize an identical
"unitary" system for postjudgment substantial assistance
motions. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) ("[O]n motion of
the Government made within one year after the imposition
of the sentence," court may reduce sentence "to reflect a
defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance"; this may include reduction "to a level below that established by statute
as a minimum sentence"). Thus in my view, the Commission
had the power to create a "unitary motion system," and is
free to maintain such a system, or to change it, in light of
evolving criminal justice policies.
In this case, the lower courts accepted the Government's
"departure" motion as sufficient to justify a departure below
the 135-month Guideline minimum applicable to petitioner's
crime, but not sufficient to justify a departure below the applicable 10-year statutory minimum. On a "unitary" view,
this disposition could not be correct. Either the motion was
sufficient to warrant a departure below the statutory minimum, or it was insufficient to warrant a departure below the
Guideline minimum. I would remand this case to the lower
courts for further consideration of this case-specific issue.
For these reasons, while agreeing with much of what the
Court has written, I dissent from its disposition.
