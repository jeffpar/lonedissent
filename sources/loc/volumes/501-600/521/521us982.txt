POUNDERS, JUDGE, SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY v.
PENELOPE WATSON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-1383. Decided June 27, 1997
Respondent represented William Mora during a multidefendant murder
trial in a California court. During the trial, the presiding judge, petitioner here, admonished counsel that the issue of the punishment defendants might receive if they were convicted was not open for discussion and should not be explored. When respondent brought up possible
punishment while questioning Mora, the judge found her in contempt,
concluding that the sole purpose of her questions was to improperly
advise the jury of the potential penalty in violation of the court's order,
that she was aware of the order, and that her conduct permanently prejudiced the jury. After her state habeas petitions were denied, the Federal District Court denied federal habeas relief, holding that multiple
statements made in open court gave respondent adequate warning as to
the prohibited conduct, thus satisfying due process notice requirements.
In reversing, the Ninth Circuit did not dispute the trial court's findings,
but held that respondent's conduct was not so disruptive as to justify
the use of summary contempt procedures.
Held: The Ninth Circuit erred in ruling that the contempt order went
beyond those necessities pertaining to the ordered administration of justice. Longstanding precedent confirms the courts' power to find summary contempt and impose punishment. See, e. g., Ex parte Terry, 128
U. S. 289. Since that power may be abused, summary contempt orders
are confined to misconduct occurring in court, In re Oliver, 333 U. S.
257, 275, where the affront to the court's dignity is more widely observed, justifying summary vindication, see In re Green, 369 U. S. 689,
692. However, nothing in this Court's cases supports the Ninth Circuit's requirements that a contemnor engage in a pattern of repeated
violations pervading the courtroom before she can be held in contempt
and that a court determine that a contemnor would have repeated the
misconduct but for summary punishment. To the contrary, this Court
upheld summary contempt convictions after a single refusal to give immunized testimony, United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309, 314, and found
that the principle that the least possible power adequate to the end
proposed should be used in contempt cases was satisfied because a court

Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
Per Curiam
is justified in acting swiftly to prevent a breakdown of the proceedings
during an ongoing trial, id., at 319. Seriously prejudicing the jury, as
the trial court found here, is comparable in terms of damage to the
administration of justice to the refusals to testify in Wilson. There is
no need to explore here what limitations and standards due process
imposes on the authority to issue a summary contempt order, since respondent's conduct was well within the range of contumacious conduct
disruptive of judicial proceedings and damaging to the trial court's
authority.
Certiorari granted; 102 F. 3d 433, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
granted respondent's habeas corpus petition and held invalid
on due process grounds her conviction for summary contempt before a state-court judge for conduct in open court.
The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the constitutional requirements for imposition of a summary contempt order.
We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse.
Respondent Penelope Watson is an attorney who represented William Mora in a multidefendant murder trial in the
Superior Court of the State of California in and for the
County of Los Angeles. The Honorable William Pounders
presided over the case, and he is the petitioner here. On
April 7, 1994, counsel for one of Mora's codefendants repeatedly raised in open court the issue of the punishment defendants might receive if they were convicted. Judge Pounders
stated that possible punishment "'is not a subject that's open
to discussion. It should not be explored."' App. to Pet. for
Cert. 20. Though it is not clear whether this was said at a
bench conference only or reiterated in open court, it seems
respondent remained at the defense table during the bench
conference. Her co-counsel, Joseph Gutierrez, was at the
bench on behalf of their client Mora. In later proceedings,
Judge Pounders noted that "Miss Watson is no more than six
feet away from us when we're at the side bar conference.
She's at the end of the center table closest to the bench and
only a matter of feet away." Id., at 36.

POUNDERS v. WATSON
Per Curiam

On April 20, counsel for a different codefendant again
raised the issue of punishment. Judge Pounders stated in
open court: "'[T]he subject of sentencing of Mr. Fernandez
is not part of the conversation. But more than that, it is
prejudicial under [Cal. Evid. Code Ann. ยง ]352 [(West 1966)].
It's not a subject the jury is entitled to discuss. This is not
a death penalty case, so penalties are not something to discuss .... '" Id., at 21.
The next day, respondent's co-counsel Gutierrez asked a
series of questions in which he stated that defendants were
"looking at life in prison." At a bench conference, while
respondent remained at the defense table, Judge Pounders
told Gutierrez:
"'You had an ulterior motive in bringing out the amount
of time [the witness] spent [in prison], and I think it's to
show the contrast between what he got and what your
clients may be facing .... I'm saying that's the last time
I want to hear anything about a sentence ....
You've
covered it. Do not cover it again."' Watson v. Block,
102 F. 3d 433, 435 (CA9 1996).
After the side bar, Gutierrez apologized in open court:
"'Judge, I would just like the record to reflect that I
apologize to this court for asking the question as to or
informing this witness through my question that he
served six months in jail and three years probation....
I obviously defied the Court Order, and I misunderstood
the Court and I apologize."' Ibid.
In response, Judge Pounders said in open court: "'It's simply
that punishment is not an issue for this jury to decide, and
the more that counsel want to harp on this issue of punishment, the more inappropriate it becomes.'" Ibid.
On June 21, while respondent was questioning Mora, the
following examination and colloquy occurred:

Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
Per Curiam

By Ms. Watson: "[T]hroughout this trial sometimes
you've had to get up at 4:00 in the morning and not go
to sleep until 10:00 at night?
"Ms. Walker [for the People of California]: Objection,
your honor, relevance.
"The Court: Sustained.
"By Ms. Watson: And during that four years [that you
have been in prison], you were facing the death penalty
until just the day before we started.
"Ms. Walker: Your honor, People are going to object.
"The Court: Sustained.
"Ms. Walker: Ask Miss Watson to be admonished and
the Court"The Court: Sustained. We've already talked about
this at side bar. Follow the Court's admonitions.
"By Ms. Watson: You're facing life without possibility of
parole?" App. to Pet. for Cert. 30-31.
At that point, Judge Pounders called counsel to the bench.
The judge asked respondent why he should not hold her in
contempt for discussing punishment after he had "at least
twice ordered counsel not to cover" the issue. Respondent
replied, "I think it goes to [Mora's] state of mind as to why
he would take this risk at this point in revealing that he
was the person who called 911." When the judge asked why
respondent did not raise the point at sidebar, particularly
when her co-counsel Gutierrez had been admonished for raising the issue, Watson responded: "I wasn't at side bar with
any of that involving Mr. Gutierrez . . ."

The judge said,

"You're in violation of a court order. You do not think that's
relevant to anything?" Watson responded, "I didn't think it
was." Id., at 31, 32.
Judge Pounders then found respondent in contempt for
violating Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. ยง 1209(a)(5) (West 1997),
which provides that "[d]isobedience of any lawful judgment,

POUNDERS v. WATSON
Per Curiam

order, or process of the court" is grounds for contempt. The
next day, on June 22, the judge issued a written order of
contempt finding that "the questions asked by contemnor of
Defendant Mora in the presence of the jury had as its [sic]
sole purpose improperly advising the jury of the potential
penalty for the defendants in violation of the court order."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 26. He found "contemnor was aware
of the Order," since she was
"at all times ... present (a) at or immediately adjacent
to all side bar conferences and (b) present in open court
on April 7,1994, when the initial warning was given, and
(c) on April 20, 1994, when the warning was repeated in
open court, and (d) on April 21, 1994, when co-counsel
Mr. Gutierrez apologized in open court for defying that
same order." Ibid.
The court imposed a 2-day jail sentence to be served after
trial.
On July 8, two days after the murder case was submitted
to the jury, Judge Pounders gave respondent another opportunity to justify her actions. She again explained and argued through her counsel that she thought her questions
were relevant and "'not covered by the court's previous rulings or admonitions."' 102 F. 3d, at 436. Judge Pounders
was not convinced. Respondent, he noted, did not ask for a
side bar for clarification. He found:
"'I think she has permanently prejudiced this jury in
favor of her client.... They know the penalty he's facing
... and they know that the person that was killed [a
gang member] isn't worth that penalty, and so they are
not going to find him guilty of the major charge.
"'And when the penalty is as extreme as this one is presented to the jury, I think that's a prejudice that cannot
be overcome ....

Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
Per Curiam

"'And I believe that the result is going to be that [the
jury] will not find Mr. Mora guilty of the main offense,
which is murder, that they may not find him guilty of
much at all."' Ibid.
Respondent's habeas petitions to the California Court of
Appeal and the California Supreme Court were denied summarily. She filed this federal habeas corpus action in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. The District Court denied the petition on September 8, 1994, finding "[t]he record makes it quite clear that
multiple statements made in open court gave Petitioner adequate warning to put a person of reasonable intelligence on
notice as to what conduct Judge Pounders had prohibited,
satisfying due process notice requirements." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 15.
Respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that her due process
rights were violated because she did not have notice of the
prohibited conduct and because the trial judge could not
have known without a hearing whether her conduct was willful. The Court of Appeals did not dispute the state trial
court's findings on these points. Instead, it held that "her
conduct was not so disruptive as to justify use of summary
contempt procedure," 102 F. 3d, at 437.
Longstanding precedent confirms the power of courts to
find summary contempt and impose punishment. See, e.g.,
Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S.289 (1888). In Cooke v. United
States, 267 U. S.517 (1925), the Court said:
"To preserve order in the court room for the proper conduct of business, the court must act instantly to suppress disturbance or violence or physical obstruction or
disrespect to the court when occurring in open court.
There is no need of evidence or assistance of counsel
before punishment, because the court has seen the of-

POUNDERS v. WATSON
Per Curiam

fense. Such summary vindication of the court's dignity
and authority is necessary. It has always been so in the
courts of the common law and the punishment imposed
is due process of law." Id., at 534-535.
As we have recognized, however, the contempt power may
be abused. We have held the summary contempt exception
to the normal due process requirements, such as a hearing,
counsel, and the opportunity to call witnesses, "includes only
charges of misconduct, in open court, in the presence of the
judge, which disturbs the court's business, where all of the
essential elements of the misconduct are under the eye of the
court, are actually observed by the court, and where immediate punishment is essential to prevent 'demoralization of
the court's authority' before the public." In re Oliver, 333
U. S. 257, 275 (1948) (quoting Cooke, supra, at 536).
We have stressed the importance of confining summary
contempt orders to misconduct occurring in court. Where
misconduct occurs in open court, the affront to the court's
dignity is more widely observed, justifying summary vindication. See In re Green, 369 U. S. 689, 692 (1962) (relying
on due process cases); Harrisv. United States, 382 U. S. 162,
164 (1965) (defining boundary between summary and ordinary contempt under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 42).
United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309 (1975), sheds light
on the case before us. In Wilson, the prosecution called two
witnesses who, in open court, refused to testify. The United
States District Court granted immunity and ordered them
to answer. The witnesses still refused, and the court summarily held them in contempt. We noted that although the
witnesses' refusals to testify were "not delivered disrespectfully," id., at 314, their conduct nevertheless justified summary contempt under Rule 42(a). It was not intimated that
the contempt convictions there violated due process. "The
face-to-face refusal to comply with the court's order itself
constituted an affront to the court, and when that kind of
refusal disrupts and frustrates an ongoing proceeding, as it

Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
Per Curiam

did here, summary contempt must be available to vindicate
the authority of the court .... ." Id., at 316. Even the dissent suggested contempt convictions would have been warranted if the witnesses had engaged in "'insolent tactics.'"
Id., at 326 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quoting Harris, supra,
at 165).
In this case the state trial court made an express finding
that respondent willfully refused to comply with the court's
order. Again and again the trial court admonished counsel,
both in open court and at bench conferences when respondent was sitting a few feet away, not to discuss punishment.
After respondent asked her client whether he had been facing the death penalty, the court sustained an objection and
said: "'We've already talked about this at side bar. Follow
the Court's admonitions."' App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. Undaunted, respondent's next question was, "'You're facing life
without possibility of parole?"' Id., at 25.
The Court of Appeals did not question the willfulness
finding in its opinion. 102 F. 3d, at 438 ("[W]e do not decide
the issue whether Ms. Watson willfully disobeyed a court
order"). Instead, the Court of Appeals held her conduct
was not sufficiently disruptive because she herself "did not
engage in a pattern of repeated violations that pervaded the
courtroom and threatened the dignity of the court" and because the record did not indicate she would have repeated
the references to punishment unless she were held in summary contempt. Ibid.
All that is before us is the ruling that respondent's conduct
was not disruptive enough to justify contempt, and on this
issue we are in disagreement with the Court of Appeals.
Nothing in our cases supports a requirement that a contemnor "engage in a pattern of repeated violations that pervaded
the courtroom," ibid., before she may be held in summary
contempt. To the contrary, in Wilson, the summary contempt convictions were upheld after a single refusal to give
immunized testimony, "not delivered disrespectfully." 421

POUNDERS v. WATSON
Per Curiam

U. S., at 314. We nevertheless held that the conduct there
"disrupt[ed] and frustrat[ed] an ongoing proceeding." Id.,
at 316. And we have not required that a court determine a
contemnor would have repeated the misconduct but for summary punishment. While we have approved, in the context
of reviewing a federal contempt order, the equitable principle that only "'the least possible power adequate to the end
proposed' should be used in contempt cases," id., at 319
(quoting Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821)), we
found that principle satisfied in the circumstances in Wilson
because, during an ongoing trial, the court is justified in acting swiftly "to prevent a breakdown of the proceedings."
421 U. S., at 319. Likewise, in Sacher v. United States, 343
U. S. 1, 5 (1952), the Court upheld summary contempt convictions of counsel where the misconduct had the following
characteristics: "It took place in the immediate presence of
the trial judge; it consisted of breaches of decorum and disobedience in the presence of the jury of his orders and rulings upon the trial; the misconduct was professional in that
it was that of lawyers" and conviction was based "upon a
course of conduct long-continued in the face of warnings that
it was regarded by the court as contemptuous." See also
Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U. S. 496, 506 (1972). Cf. Illinois v.
Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 343 (1970) ("We believe trial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant
defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the
circumstances of each case").
Here the trial court expressly found that respondent's
questions had "permanently prejudiced the jury in favor of
her client" and that the prejudice "cannot be overcome."
The Court of Appeals glossed over the state-court finding,
saying "we can understand Judge Pounders' concern that her
two questions might prejudice jurors in favor of her client,"
102 F. 3d, at 438 (emphasis added). Seriously prejudicing
the jury is comparable in terms of damage to the administration of justice to the refusals to testify in Wilson. The trial
court's finding that respondent's comments had prejudiced

STEVENS,

J., dissenting

the jury-together with its assessment of the flagrance of
respondent's defiance-support the finding of the need for
summary contempt to vindicate the court's authority.
While the Due Process Clause no doubt imposes limits on
the authority to issue a summary contempt order, the States
must have latitude in determining what conduct so infects
orderly judicial proceedings that contempt is permitted. As
we have noted, we have used various phrases to describe
the type of conduct required. We need not explore these
limitations and standards, however, for the conduct of counsel here was well within the range of contumacious conduct
disruptive of judicial proceedings and damaging to the
court's authority. Advocacy that is "fearless, vigorous, and
effective," Sacher, supra, at 13, does not extend to disruptive
conduct in the course of trial and in knowing violation of a
clear and specific direction from the trial judge.
On the record before us, the Court of Appeals was in error.
It was error for the Court of Appeals to rule, as a matter of
law, that the contempt order went beyond those necessities
pertaining to the ordered administration of justice. The ruling of the Court of Appeals, not reviewed en banc, introduced uncertainty into routine proceedings of the many state
courts within the Court of Appeals' large geographical jurisdiction. The judgment is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,

dissenting.
As the Court correctly explains, the record supports the
conclusion that respondent defied a court order when she
asked two questions about her client's potential punishment.
I assume, therefore, that she acted in contempt of court.
The record also demonstrates, however, that no further misconduct or disruption of the trial occurred. The question
the Court of Appeals addressed was whether these circumstances justified a summary contempt proceeding conducted
by the judge before whom the contempt occurred. I do not

POUNDERS v. WATSON
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

agree with the Court that the answer to this question is so
clear as to justify summary reversal.
In the majority of the cases relied on by the Court, the
summary contempt power was invoked to punish conduct
that threatened to disrupt the court's ongoing proceedings.
See, e. g., United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S.309 (1975). A
more substantial question arises when the summary contempt proceeding is not invoked to prevent disruption of the
trial, but to punish action that has already occurred. As
Justice Frankfurter recognized in his dissenting opinion in
Sacher v. United States, 343 U. S. 1 (1952), concerns about
the adequacy of procedural safeguards are heightened in
cases involving summary contempt procedures:
"Summary punishment of contempt is concededly an
exception to the requirements of Due Process. Necessity dictates the departure. Necessity must bound its
limits. In this case, the course of events to the very
end of the trial shows that summary measures were not
necessary to enable the trial to go on. Departure from
established judicial practice, which makes it unfitting for
a judge who is personally involved to sit in his own case,
was therefore unwarranted....
"This, then, was not a situation in which, even though
a judge was personally involved as the target of the contemptuous conduct, peremptory action against contemnors was necessary to maintain order and to salvage the
proceedings. Where such action is necessary for the
decorous continuance of a pending trial, disposition by
another judge of a charge of contempt is impracticable.
Interruption for a hearing before a separate judge
would disrupt the trial and thus achieve the illicit purpose of a contemnor." Id., at 36-37, 39.
We recognized these limits to a court's summary contempt
power in In re McConnell, 370 U. S.230 (1962), where we
granted plenary review and set aside a $100 contempt sanc-

Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

tion for conduct that was more disruptive (although arguably more justified) than what occurred in this case.* We
emphasized:
"To preserve the kind of trials that our system envisages, Congress has limited the summary contempt
power vested in courts to the least possible power adequate to prevent actual obstruction of justice, and we
think that that power did not extend to this case." Id.,
at 236.
Given that the respondent in this case asked two inappropriate questions over the course of a three and a half month
long trial and that the trial continued without incident for
two weeks after her contemptuous conduct, a substantial
question exists as to whether fair procedure required a hearing before another judge. Neither the Court nor the petitioner contends that this summary contempt power was exercised to prevent the "actual obstruction of justice," such
that a hearing before an entirely disinterested judge would
have been impractical. Because I believe that these questions are important and not clearly answered by our precedents-indeed, the Court does not cite a single case that is
at all comparable to this one on its facts-it is unwise to
answer it without full briefing and argument.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
*In McConnell, the judge had erroneously ruled that plaintiff's counsel
could not try a charge of conspiracy, holding that he must do so in a separate trial. To preserve his client's rights on appeal, counsel persisted in
asking questions in the presence of the jury regarding the conspiracy
charge. Counsel then refused to obey the judge's order to stop asking
the questions, and stated that he would continue to do so unless stopped
by the bailiff. After a recess, plaintiff's counsel returned to trial and
asked no more forbidden questions. Following trial, and after holding a
hearing, the trial judge summarily found counsel guilty of contempt and
imposed a jail sentence. On appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the
convictions, but reduced the sentence to a fine of $100.
