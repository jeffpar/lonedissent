FOREMAN ET AL. v. DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS,
ET AL.
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
No. 96-987. Decided June 27, 1997*
A Texas statute authorizes counties to appoint election judges to supervise
voting on election days. Since 1983, Dallas County has changed its appointment procedures several times, always using party-affiliation formulas. Appellants sued the county and others in the Federal District
Court, claiming that § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required that
the most recent change be precleared. A three-judge court held that
preclearance was not required because the county was simply exercising
its discretion to adjust the procedure according to party power; concluded that the Justice Department's preclearance of a 1985 submission
of Texas' recodified election code operated to preclear the county's use
of partisan considerations; denied injunctive relief; and later dismissed
appellants' complaint.
Held: The District Court's decision is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. First, an administrative effort to comply with a precleared statute may require separate preclearance because §5 reaches informal,
as well as formal, changes. NAACP v. Hampton County Election
Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166, 178. Second, the State's 1985 submissionwhich indicated that the only change being made to the statute was to
the beginning date and duration of the election judges' appointmentwas clearly insufficient to put the Justice Department on notice that the
State was seeking to preclear using partisan affiliations to select election judges. See, e. g., Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 286-287. Because the record is silent as to the county's procedure for appointing
election judges on the date on which Texas became a covered jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act, this Court cannot make a final determination whether preclearance is in fact required.
No. 96-987, dismissed and remanded; No. 96-1389, vacated and remanded.

FOREMAN v. DALLAS COUNTY

Per Curiam
PER CURIAM.

Texas by statute authorizes counties to appoint election
judges, one for each precinct, who supervise voting at the
polls on election days. In 1983 and several times thereafter,
Dallas County changed its procedures for selecting these officials. Each of the new methods used party-affiliation formulas of one sort or another. After the most recent change
in 1996, appellants sued the county and others in the United
States District Court, claiming that § 5 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973c,
required that the changes be precleared.
A three-judge court held that preclearance was not required because the county was simply exercising, under the
state statute, its "discretion to adjust [the procedure for appointing election judges] according to party power." App.
to Juris. Statement 4a. The court apparently concluded that
this "discretionary" use of political power meant that the
various methods for selecting election judges were not covered changes under § 5. The court also concluded that the
Justice Department's preclearance of a 1985 submission from
the State-the recodification of its entire election code-operated to preclear the county's use of partisan considerations
in selecting election judges. The court denied injunctive relief, and later dismissed appellants' complaint pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Appellants have
brought both of these rulings here.
We believe that the decision of the District Court is inconsistent with our precedents. First, in NAACP v. Hampton
County Election Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166, 178 (1985), we held
that even "an administrative effort to comply with a statute
that had already received clearance" may require separate
preclearance, because §5 "reaches informal as well as formal
changes." Thus, the fact that the county here was exercising its "discretion" pursuant to a state statute does not shield
its actions from § 5. The question is simply whether the
county, by its actions, whether taken pursuant to a statute

Per Curiam

or not, "enact[ed] or [sought] to administer any... standard,
practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from"
the one in place on November 1, 1972. § 5. The fact that
the county's new procedures used political party affiliation
as the selection criterion does not mean that the methods
were exempt from preclearance.
Second, the State's 1985 submission (the recodification and
a 30-page summary of changes to the old law) indicated that
the only change being made to the statute concerning election judges was a change to "the beginning date and duration
of [their] appointment." Thus, neither the recodified statute
nor the State's explanations said anything about the use of
specific, partisan-affiliation methods for selecting election
judges. This submission was clearly insufficient under our
precedents to put the Justice Department on notice that the
State was seeking preclearance of the use of partisan affiliations in selecting election judges. See, e. g., Young v.
Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 286-287 (1997); Lopez v. Monterey
County, 519 U. S.9,15 (1996); Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S.646,
658-659 (1991).
Because the parties agree that the record is silent as to
the procedure used by Dallas County for appointing election
judges as of November 1, 1972, the date on which Texas became a covered jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act, we
cannot make a final determination here as to whether preclearance is in fact required. We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court in No. 96-1389, dismiss the appeal
from the District Court's interlocutory judgment in No. 96987, see Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S.37, 44 (1920), and remand
the cases for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
