insufficient under standard of In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358. Victor v.
Nebraska, p. 1.

2. Mail Order Drug ParaphernaliaControl Act-Vagueness.-Former

VIII. Right to Counsel.

1. Confessions-Admissibility.-Title 18 U. S. C. §3501(c), which provides that a custodial confession made within six hours of arrest is not

solely on state charges. United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, p. 350.
2. Firearms possession-Convicted felon-Restoration of state civil
rights.-A person with a federal felony conviction who has had his civil

possess a firearm. Beecham v. United States, p. 368.
3. Firearms possession-Machinegun.-To obtain a conviction under
National Firearms Act-which criminalizes possession of an unregistered
firearm, including a machinegun-Government should have been required
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew of features of

"machinegun." Staples v. United States, p. 600.
4. Firearmspossession-Sentenceenhancement-Validity of state convictions.-Except for convictions obtained in violation of right to counsel,
