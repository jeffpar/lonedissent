officers raided the farm of respondents-members of the extended Kurth family-arrested them, and confiscated and
later destroyed their marijuana plants. After the Kurths pleaded
guilty to drug charges, petitioner revenue department attempted, in a
separate proceeding, to collect a state tax imposed on the possession
and storage of dangerous drugs. That tax is collected only after any
state or federal fines or forfeitures have been satisfied, and taxpayers
must file a return after they are arrested. In bankruptcy proceedings
filed by the Kurths, they objected to petitioner's proof of claim for the
tax and challenged the tax's constitutionality. The Bankruptcy Court
held, among other things, that the assessment on harvested marijuana,
a portion of which resulted in a tax eight times the product's market
value, was a form of double jeopardy invalid under the Federal Constitution, and the District Court affirmed. In affirming, the Court of Appeals determined that the central inquiry under United States v. Halper,
490 U. S. 435, is whether the sanction imposed is rationally related to
the damages the government suffered, that the Kurths were entitled to
an accounting to determine if the sanction constituted an impermissible
second punishment, and that the tax was unconstitutional as applied to
them because the State refused to offer any such evidence.
Held" The tax violates the constitutional prohibition against successive
punishments for the same offense. Pp. 776-784.
(a) Although deciding in Halper that a legislature's description of a
statute as civil does not foreclose the possibility that it has a punitive
character, and that a defendant convicted and punished for an offense
may not have a nonremedial civil penalty imposed against him for the
same offense in a separate proceeding, the Court did not consider
whether a tax may similarly be characterized as punitive. However,
the Court's recognition that the extension of a so-called tax's penalizing
feature can cause it to lose its character as such and become a mere
penalty, A Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 46, together with
Halper's unequivocal statement that labels do not control in a double
jeopardy inquiry, indicates that a tax is not immune from double jeopardy scrutiny simply because it is a tax. Pp. 776-780.

(b) While taxes are usually motivated by revenue-raising rather than
punitive purposes, Montana's tax departs far from normal revenue laws.
Its high rate and deterrent purpose, in and of themselves, do not necessarily render it punitive, but other unusual features set it apart from
most taxes. That it is conditioned on the commission of a crime is significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of
revenue. It is also exacted only after the taxpayer has been arrested
for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation in the first
place. Since the taxed activity is completely forbidden, the legitimate
revenue-raising purpose that might support the tax could be equally
well served by increasing the fine imposed upon conviction. In addition, it purports to be a property tax, yet it is levied on goods-here,
the destroyed marijuana plants-that the taxpayer neither owns nor
poseagm. Pp. 790-793.
(c) Since tax statutes serve a purpose quite different from civil
penalties, it is inappropriate to subject Montana's tax to Halper's test
for a civil penalty: whether the penalty is imposed as a remedy for
actual costs to the State that are attributable to the defendant's conduct.
Moreover, Montana has not claimed that its assessments can be justified
on such grounds, and the same formula would have been used to compute the assessment regardless of the State's damages or whether it
suffered any damages. Montana's tax is not the kind of remedial sanction that may follow the first punishment of a criminal offense. It is a
second punishment that must be imposed during the first prosecution or
not at all. P. 784.

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.
KURTH RANCH
Opinion of the Court

I
Montana's Dangerous Drug Tax Act 2 took effect on October 1, 1987. The Act imposes a tax "on the possession and
storage of dangerous drugs,"' Mont. Code Ann. § 15-25-111
(1987), and expressly provides that the tax is to be "collected
only after any state or federal finog or forfeitures have been
satisfied." § 15-25-111(3). The tax is either 10 percent of
the assessed market value of the drugs as determined by
the Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) or a specified
amount depending on the drug ($100 per ounce for marijuana, for example, and $250 per ounce for hashish), whichever is greater. § 15-25-111(2). The Act directs the state
treasurer to allocate the tax proceeds to special funds to support "youth evaluation" and "chemical abuse" programs and
"to enforce the drug laws." §§ 15-25-121, 15-25-122. 4
In addition to imposing reporting responsibilities on law
enforcement agencies,5 the Act also authorizes the DOR to
2

Mont. Code Ann. §§ 15-25-101 through 15-25-123 (1987). See In re
Kurth Ranch, 145 B. R. 61, 66 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mont. 1990). We refer
throughout this opinion to the 1987 edition of the Montana Code-the version in effect at the time of the Kurths' arrest. Some sections of the
Dangerous Drug Tax Act have since been amended.
3The Act defines "dangerous drug" as that term is defined in the Montana Code provisions that criminalize the possession of such drugs, see
Mont. Code Ann. §§ 15-25-103(2), 50-32-101(6), 45-9-102 (1987), and authorize their seizure, see §44-12-103.
4According to the Act's preamble, the Montana Legislature recognizes
that the use of dangerous drugs is not acceptable, but concludes that because the manufacturing and sale of such drugs has an economic impact
on the State, "it is appropriate that some of the revenue generated by
this tax be devoted to continuing investigative efforts directed toward the
identification, arrest, and prosecution of individuals involved in conducting
illegal continuing criminal enterprises that affect the distribution of dangerous drugs in Montana." 1987 Mont. Laws, ch. 563, p. 1416.
6 Section 5(1) of the Act provides that "[a]ll law enforcement personnel
and peace officers shall promptly report each person subject to the tax to
the department, together with such other information which the depart-

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

adopt rules to administer and enforce the tax. Under those
rules, taxpayers must file a return within 72 hours of their
arrest. Mont. Admin. Rule 42.34.102(1) (1988). The Rule
also provides that "[a]t the time of arrest law enforcement
personnel shall complete the dangerous drug information report as required by the department and afford the taxpayer
an opportunity to sign it." Rule 42.34.102(3). If the taxpayer refuses to do so, the law enforcement officer is required to file the form within 72 hours of the arrest. Ibid.
The "associated criminal nature of assessments under this
act" justifies the expedited collection procedures. See Rule
42.34.103(3). The taxpayer has no obligation to file a return
or to pay any tax unless and until he is arrested.
II
The six respondents, all members of the extended Kurth
family, have for years operated a mixed grain and livestock
farm in central Montana. 6 In 1986 they began to cultivate
and sell marijuana. About two weeks after the new Dangerous Drug Tax Act went into effect, Montana law enforcement officers raided the farm, arrested the Kurths,
and confiscated all the marijuana plants, materials, and paraphernalia they found. In re Kurth Ranch, 145 B. R. 61,
66 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mont. 1990).1 The raid put an end to the
ment may require, in a manner and on a form prescribed by the department." Mont. Code Ann. § 15-25-113(1) (1987).
6The respondents are Richard Kurth; his wife, Judith Kurth; their son,
Douglas Kurth; their daughter, Cindy Halley; Douglas' wife, Rhonda
Kurth; and Cindy's husband, Clayton Halley.
7The Drug Tax Report listed the following seized items:
"Item #1: 2155 marijuana plants in various stages of growth,
"Item #2: 7 gallons of hash oil, (lined out),
"Item #3: 4 bags of marijuana at two pounds each,
"Item #4: 65/one gram vials of hash tar,
"Item #5: 14 baby food size jars of hash tar,
"Item #6: 7 pint jars of hash tar,

Opinion of the Court

marijuana business and gave rise to four separate legal
proceedings.
In one of those proceedings, the State filed criminal
charges against all six respondents in the Montana District
Court, charging each with conspiracy to possess drugs with
the intent to sell, Mont. Code Ann. § 45-4-102 (1987), or, in
the alternative, possession of drugs with the intent to sell,
§45-9-103.8 Each respondent initially pleaded not guilty,
but subsequently entered into a plea agreement. On July
18, 1988, the court sentenced Richard Kurth and Judith
Kurth to prison and imposed suspended or deferred sentences on the other four family members. 9
The county attorney also filed a civil forfeiture action seeking recovery of cash and equipment used in the marijuana
operation. The confiscated drugs were not involved in that
action, presumably because law enforcement agents had destroyed them after an inventory. Respondents settled the
forfeiture action with an agreement to forfeit $18,016.83 in
cash and various items of equipment.
"Item #7: 1 bag of marijuana, 1/4 pound,
"Item #8: 5 plastic bags of marijuana, total 2230 grams,
"Item #9: approximately 100 pounds of marijuana stems, leaves, parts,
etc." 145 B. R., at 66-67.
8
Plaintiff's Exhs. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; 145 B. R., at 64-65. Richard Kurth
was also charged with criminal sale of dangerous drugs (marijuana), Mont.
Code Ann. § 45-9-101 (1987), criminal possession of a dangerous drug
(marijuana) with intent to sell, §45-9-103, solicitation to commit the offense of criminal possession of a dangerous drug (marijuana) with intent
to sell, §45-4-101, and criminal possession of a dangerous drug (hashish),
§45-9-102. See Plaintiff's Exh. 3.
9Because only one respondent, Richard Kurth, was adjudged guilty of
the offense of possession (the other five pleaded guilty to the conspiracy
count), Montana has suggested that only he has standing to argue that the
tax on possession constitutes a second punishment for the same offense.
Respondents counter that Montana's withdrawal of the possession charges
pursuant to the plea agreements would bar a second prosecution for possession. The issue was not raised below, so we do not address it.

Opinion of the Court

The third proceeding involved the assessment of the new
tax on dangerous drugs. Despite difficulties the DOR had
in applying the Act for the first time, it ultimately attempted
to collect almost $900,000 in taxes on marijuana plants,
harvested marijuana, hash tar and hash oil, interest, and penalties. 10 The Kurths contested the assessments in administrative proceedings. Those proceedings were automatically
stayed in September 1988, however, when the Kurths initiated the fourth legal proceeding triggered by the raid on
their farm: a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. See 11 U. S. C. §362(a).
In the bankruptcy proceedings, the Kurths objected to the
DOR's proof of claim for unpaid drug taxes and challenged
the constitutionality of the Montana tax. After a trial, the
Bankruptcy Court held most of the assessment invalid as a
matter of state law,11 but concluded that an assessment of
$181,000 on 1,811 ounces of harvested marijuana was authorized by the Act. It held that assessment invalid under the
Federal Constitution.
Relying primarily on United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435 (1989), the Bankruptcy Court decided that the assessment constituted a form of double jeopardy. The court rejected the State's argument that the tax was not a penalty
because it was designed to recover law enforcement costs; as
the court noted, the DOR "failed to introduce one scintilla of
evidence as to cost of the above government programs or
costs of law enforcement incurred to combat illegal drug
1oThe precise figure appears to be $894,940.99. 145 B. R., at 68. The
Court of Appeals' figure of "nearly $865,000," In re Kurth Ranch, 986
F. 2d 1308, 1310 (CA9 1993), apparently failed to take account of the
$30,000 collected before computation of the final assessment. 145 B. R.,
at 68.
11
Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court held that the assessments on the
live marijuana plants and the marijuana oil were "arbitrary" and "lacked
any basis in fact." Id., at 69.

KURTH RANCH
Opinion of the Court

activity." 145 B. R., at 74. After noting that a portion of
the assessment resulted in a tax eight times the product's
market value, 12 the court explained that the punitive character of the tax was evident
"because drug tax laws have historically been regarded
as penal in nature, the Montana Act promotes the traditional aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence,
the tax applies to behavior which is already a crime, the
tax allows for sanctions by restraint of Debtors' property, the tax requires a finding of illegal possession of
dangerous drugs and therefore a finding of scienter, the
tax will promote elimination of illegal drug possession,
and the tax appears excessive in relation to the alternate purpose assigned, especially in the absence of any
record developed by the State as to societal costs. Finally, the tax follows arrest for possession of illegal
drugs and the tax report is made by law enforcement
officers, not the taxpayer, who may or may not sign the
report." Id., at 75-76.
These aspects led the court to the "inescapable conclusion"
that the drug tax statute's purpose was deterrence and punishment. Id., at 76.
The District Court affirmed. Agreeing with the Bankruptcy Court's findings and reasoning, it concluded that the
Montana Dangerous Drug Tax Act "simply punishes the
Kurths a second time for the same criminal conduct." In
re Kurth Ranch, CV-90-084-GF, 1991 WL 365065 (D. Mont.,
Apr. 23, 1991) (reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 22). That
12That portion

is the tax imposed upon 100 pounds of "shake." "Shake"
refers to the stems, leaves, and other loose parts of the marijuana plant
that have less value because of their lower levels of tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the chemical substance in marijuana that activates a user's senses.
Id., at 66. Officials placed the market value for shake at $200 per pound.
Thus, when Montana taxed the shake at $100 per ounce, or $1,600 per
pound, it taxed it at eight times its market value. Id., at 72.

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

and the DOR's failure to provide an accounting of its actual
damages or costs convinced the Bankruptcy Court that the
tax assessments violated the Fifth Amendment's Double
Jeopardy Clause. Ibid.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also affirmed,
but based its conclusion largely on the State's refusal to offer
evidence justifying the tax, and accordingly refused to hold
the tax unconstitutional on its face. In re Kurth Ranch, 986
F. 2d 1308, 1312 (1993). The court first determined that
under Halper,a disproportionately large civil penalty can be
punitive for double jeopardy purposes. 986 F. 2d, at 1310.
That the assessment is called a tax, as opposed to some kind
of penalty, is not controlling. Id., at 1310-1311. The central inquiry under Halper,the court determined, is whether
the sanction imposed is rationally related to the damages the
government suffered. 986 F. 2d, at 1311. That inquiry only
applies to cases in which there has been a separate criminal
conviction, however. 13 The court concluded that the Kurths
were entitled to an accounting to determine if the sanction
constitutes an impermissible second punishment, and because the State refused to offer any such evidence, it held the
tax unconstitutional as applied to the Kurths. Id., at 1312.
While this case was pending on appeal, the Montana Supreme Court reversed two lower state-court decisions that
had held that the Dangerous Drug Tax Act was a form of
double jeopardy. Sorensen v. State Dept. of Revenue, 254
Mont. 61, 836 P. 2d 29 (1992). Over the dissent of two jus"IIt is on this basis that the court distinguished this Court's cases holding a federal marijuana tax to be nonpunitive, see Minor v. United States,
396 U. S. 87 (1969); United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42 (1950), which
did not involve previous criminal convictions. 986 F. 2d, at 1311. The
court acknowledged that a State may legitimately tax criminal activities,
ibid., (citing Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, 44 (1968)), and that
a civil sanction need not satisfy a remedial analysis when it is imposed
apart from a criminal conviction. 986 F. 2d, at 1311 (citing Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,453 U. S. 609, 623 (1981)).

776

tices, the State Supreme Court found that the legislature had
intended to establish a civil, not a criminal, penalty and that
the tax had a remedial purpose other than promoting retribution and deterrence. Id., at 65, 836 P. 2d, at 31. The
court found that Halper was not controlling, both because it
expressly announced "'a rule for the rare case'" and because
the case involved a civil penalty, not a tax. 254 Mont., at 67,
836 P. 2d, at 32-33. The Sorensen court concluded that the
drug tax was not excessive and that a tax, unlike the civil
sanction at issue in Halper,requires no proof of the State's
remedial costs on the part of the State. 254 Mont., at 67-68,
836 P. 2d, at 33.
The Montana Supreme Court's decision is directly at odds
with the conclusion reached in the federal proceedings involving the Kurths. We therefore granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. 509 U. S. 953
(1993). We now affirm its judgment.
III
In Halperwe considered "whether and under what circumstances a civil penalty may constitute 'punishment' for the
purposes of double jeopardy analysis." 490 U. S., at 436.
Our answer to that question does not decide the different
question whether Montana's tax should be characterized as
punishment.
Halper was convicted of 65 separate violations of the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. § 287, each involving a
demand for $12 in reimbursement for medical services worth
only $3. After Halper was sentenced to two years in prison
and fined $5,000, the Government filed a separate action to
recover a $2,000 civil penalty for each of the 65 violations.
See 31 U. S. C. § 3729 (1982 ed., Supp. II). The District
Court found that the $130,000 recovery the statute authorized "bore no 'rational relation' to the sum of the Govern-

ment's $585 actual loss plus its costs in investigating and
prosecuting Halper's false claims."

490 U. S., at 439.

In

Cite-as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

the court's view, a civil penalty "more than 220 times greater
than the Government's measurable los[s] qualified as punishment" that was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Ibid.
On direct appeal to this Court, we rejected the Government's submission that the Double Jeopardy Clause only applied to punishment imposed in criminal proceedings, reasoning that its violation "can be identified only by assessing the
character of the actual sanctions imposed on the individual
by the machinery of the state." Id., at 447.14 In making
such an assessment, "the labels 'criminal' and 'civil' are not
of paramount importance." Ibid. Accepting the District
Court's findings, we held that "a defendant who already has
been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the
second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial,
but only as a deterrent or retribution." Id., at 448-449.
Halper thus decided that the legislature's description of a
statute as civil does not foreclose the possibility that it has
a punitive character.15 We also recognized in Halperthat a
so-called civil "penalty" may be remedial in character if it
merely reimburses the government for its actual costs arising from the defendant's criminal conduct. Id., at 449-450,
14We

noted, however, that whether a sanction constitutes punishment is

not determined from the defendant's perspective, as even remedial sanctions carry the "sting of punishment." 490 U. S., at 447, n. 7 (citing United
States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 551 (1943)).
16 Notably, in reaching that conclusion we relied in part on an earlier
case recognizing that a tax statute might be considered punitive in character for double jeopardy purposes. See 490 U. S., at 443. That case,
United States v. La Franca,282 U. S. 568 (1931), observed that the words
"tax" and "penalty" "are not interchangeable, one for the other" and that
"if an exaction be clearly a penalty it cannot be converted into a tax by
the simple expedient of calling it such." Id., at 572. See also Lipke v.
Lederer, 259 U. S. 557, 561 (1922) ("The mere use of the word 'tax' in an
act primarily designed to define and suppress crime is not enough to show
that within the true intendment of the term a tax was laid").

778

KURTH RANCH
Opinion of the Court

452. We therefore remanded the case to the District Court
to determine what portion of the statutory penalty could be
sustained as compensation for the Government's actual
damages.
Halper did not, however, consider whether a tax may
similarly be characterized as punitive.
IV
Criminal fines, civil penalties, civil forfeitures, and taxes
all share certain features: They generate government revenues, impose fiscal burdens on individuals, and deter certain
behavior. All of these sanctions are subject to constitutional constraints. A government may not impose criminal
fines without first establishing guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). A
defendant convicted and punished for an offense may not
have a nonremedial civil penalty imposed against him for
the same offense in a separate proceeding. United States v.
Halper,490 U. S. 435 (1989). A civil forfeiture may violate
the Eighth Amendment's proscription against excessive
fines. Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993). And a
statute imposing a tax on unlawful conduct may be invalid
because its reporting requirements compel taxpayers to
incriminate themselves. Marchetti v. United States, 390
U. S. 39 (1968).
As a general matter, the unlawfulness of an activity
does not prevent its taxation. Id., at 44; United States
v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 293 (1935); James v. United
States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961). Montana no doubt could collect
its tax on the possession of marijuana, for example, if it had
not previously punished the taxpayer for the same offense,
or, indeed, if it had assessed the tax in the same proceeding
that resulted in his conviction. Missouri v. Hunter, 459
U. S. 359, 368-369 (1983); see also Halper,490 U. S., at 450.
Here, we ask only whether the tax has punitive characteris-

Opinion of the Court

tics that subject it to the constraints of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Although we have never held that a tax violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, we have assumed that one might.' In
the context of other constitutional requirements, we have
repeatedly examined taxes for constitutional validity. We
have cautioned against invalidating a tax simply because its
enforcement might be oppressive or because the legislature's
motive was somehow suspect. A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44 (1934). Yet we have also recognized
that "there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing
features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as
such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of
regulation and punishment." Id., at 46 (citing Child Labor
Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38 (1922)). That comment, together
with Halper's unequivocal statement that labels do not control in a double jeopardy inquiry, indicates that a tax is not
immune from double jeopardy scrutiny simply because it is
a tax.
Halper recognized that "[t]his constitutional protection is
intrinsically personal," and that only "the character of the
actual sanctions" can substantiate a possible double jeopardy
violation. 490 U. S., at 447. Whereas fines, penalties, and
forfeitures are readily characterized as sanctions, taxes are
typically different because they are usually motivated by
1

Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), for example, this Court
considered a Revenue Act provision requiring the taxpayer to pay an additional 50 percent of the total amount of any deficiency due to fraud with
an intent to evade the tax. The Court assumed such a penalty could trigger double jeopardy protection if it were intended for punishment, but it
nevertheless held that the statute was constitutional because the 50 percent addition to the tax was remedial, not punitive. Id., at 398-405. Although the penalty at issue in Mitchell is arguably better characterized
as a sanction for fraud than a tax, the Court described it interchangeably
as a "sanction," id., at 405, 406, an "addition to the tax," id., at 405, an
"assessment," id., at 396, and a "tax," id., at 398, making nothing of the
potential import of the distinction.

revenue-raising, rather than punitive, purposes. Yet at
some point, an exaction labeled as a tax approaches punishment, and our task is to determine whether Montana's drug
tax crosses that line.
We begin by noting that neither a high rate of taxation
nor an obvious deterrent purpose automatically marks this
tax as a form of punishment. In this case, although those

faetorg are not dispositive, they are at least consistent with
a punitive character. A significant part of the assessment
was more than eight times the drug's market value-a remarkably high tax. 17 That the Montana Legislature intended the tax to deter people from possessing marijuana is
beyond question.18 The DOR reminds us, however, that
many taxes that are presumed valid, such as taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, are also both high and motivated to some

"The State recovered 1,811 ounces of marijuana with an estimated
value of $46,000, and taxed the marijuana at $100 per ounce (that is, the
greater of 10 percent of market value or $100 per ounce), for a total tax
of $181,000. The State thus taxed the drugs at about 400 percent of their
market value. Compared to similar taxes on legal goods and activities,
Montana's tax-assessed at a rate of 10 percent or roughly 400 percent of
market value, whichever is greater-appears to be unrivaled. Even the
taxes identified by the United States, which supports the DOR as amicus
curiae, do not approach a level this high. See Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 23-24. The United States notes hypothetically, for
example, that the current 24-cent-per-pack federal tax on cigarettes could,
under a new health plan, be increased to 99 cents, resulting in a total
tax burden that "could easily surpass" the 80 percent rate that Montana
imposed on the part of the marijuana consisting of the higher valued
"'buds.'" Ibid. The Government offers no such example, however, of a
tax equivalent to that assessed on the combined cache of buds and lower
valued "shake." See n. 12, supra.
18 For example, although the Act's preamble evinces a clear motivation
to raise revenue, it also indicates that the tax will provide for anticrime
initiatives by "burdening" violators of the law instead of "law abiding
taxpayers"; that use of dangerous drugs is not acceptable; and that the
Act is not intended to "give credence" to any notion that manufacturing,
selling, or using drugs is legal or proper. 1987 Mont. Laws, ch. 563,
p. 1416.

extent by an interest in deterrence. Indeed, although no
double jeopardy challenge was at issue, this Court sustained
the steep $100-per-ounce federal tax on marijuana in United
States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42 (1950). Thus, while a high
tax rate and deterrent purpose lend support to the characterization of the drug tax as punishment, these features, in
and of themselves, do not necessarily render the tax punitive.. Cf. Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U.S. 506, 513514 (1937).
Other unusual features, however, set the Montana statute
apart from most taxes. First, this so-called tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime. That condition is
"significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the
gathering of revenue." 19 - Moreover, the Court has relied
on the absence of such a condition to support its conclusion
that a particular federal tax was a civil, rather than a criminal, sanction. 20 In this case, the tax assessment not only
hinges on the commission of a crime, it also is exacted only
after the taxpayer has been arrested for the precise conduct
that gives rise to the tax obligation in the first place.21 Per19United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 295 (1935) (concluding

that a tax was motivated by penal instead of revenue-raising intent in part
because the taxpayer had to pay an additional sum based on his illegal
conduct).

See also United States v. La Franca,282 U. S., at 571, 575

(holding that a liquor tax assessed only against those prosecuted for illegal
manufacture or sale of liquor was barred on statutory grounds, thus avoiding the "grave constitutional question" whether double jeopardy principles
precluded such an assessment).
0 In Sanchez we examined a federal marijuana tax, IRC § 2590-(a)(2)

(since repealed, but last codified at 26 U. S. C. § 4741 et seq. (1964)), that
taxed the transfer of marijuana to a person who has not paid a special tax
and registered. Under the statute, the transferor's liability arose when
the transferee failed to pay the tax; as a result, "s]ince his tax liability
does not in effect rest on criminal conduct, the tax can be properly called

a civil rather than a criminal sanction." 340 U. S., at 45.
21This statute therefore does not raise the question whether an ostensibly civil proceeding that is designed to inflict punishment may bar a subse-

quent proceeding that is admittedly criminal in character. See JUSTICE

sons who have been arrested for possessing marijuana constitute the entire class of taxpayers subject to the Montana
tax.
Taxes imposed upon illegal activities are fundamentally
different from taxes with a pure revenue-raising purpose
that are imposed despite their adverse effect on the taxed
activity. But they differ as well from mixed-motive taxes
that governments impose both to deter a disfavored activity
and to raise money. By imposing cigarette taxes, for example, a government wants to discourage smoking. But because the product's benefits-such as creating employment,
satisfying consumer demand, and providing tax revenuesare regarded as outweighing the harm, that government will
allow the manufacture, sale, and use of cigarettes as long as
the manufacturers, sellers, and smokers pay high taxes that
reduce consumption and increase government revenue.
These justifications vanish when the taxed activity is completely forbidden, for the legitimate revenue-raising purpose
that might support such a tax could be equally well served
by increasing the fine imposed upon conviction. 22
dissent, post, at 804. Nor does the statute require us to comment on the permissibility of "multiple punishments" imposed in the same
proceeding, cf Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874); North Carolina v.
Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), since it involves separate sanctions imposed
in successive proceedings.
2 In this case, it is significant that the same sovereign that criminalized
the activity also imposed the tax. Contrarily, most of our cases confirming that the unlawfulness of an activity does not prevent its taxation involve taxes on acts prohibited by other sovereigns. For example, United
States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287 (1935), involved a federal excise tax
on retail liquor sales that violated state law. Id., at 293. Likewise, in
James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), a federal tax on embezzled
money was imposed upon a man who had pleaded guilty in state court to
conspiracy to embezzle. Id., at 214. And Marchetti v. United States, 390
U. S. 39 (1968), involved a federal tax on gambling activities primarily
prohibited under state law, though as the Court there noted, some federal
statutes also prohibited activities ancillary to wagering. Id., at 44-47.

Opinion of the Court

The Montana tax is exceptional for an additional reason.
Although it purports to be a species of property tax-that
is, a "tax on the possession and storage of dangerous drugs,"
Mont. Code Ann. § 15-25-111 (1987)-it is levied on goods
that the taxpayer neither owns nor possesses when the tax
is imposed. Indeed, the State presumably destroyed the
contraband goods in this case before the tax on them was
assessed. If a statute that amounts to a confiscation of property is unconstitutional, Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U. S. 312, 326
(1932); Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 542 (1927), a tax
on previously confiscated goods is at least questionable. 23 A
tax on "possession" of goods that no longer exist and that
the taxpayer never lawfully possessed has an unmistakable
punitive character. This tax, imposed on criminals and no
others, departs so far from normal revenue laws as to become a form of punishment.
Taken as a whole, this drug tax is a concoction of anomalies, too far removed in crucial respects from a standard tax
assessment to escape characterization as punishment for the
purpose of double jeopardy analysis.24
and dual sovereign proceedings also is borne out by our cases holding that
the Constitution does not prohibit successive prosecutions by different
sovereigns based on the same conduct. See, e. g., Bartkus v. Illinois,359
U. S. 121 (1959) (state prosecution after federal); Abbate v. United States,
359 U. S. 187 (1959) (federal prosecution after state).
2 Curiously, one of two alternative measures of the tax is the market
value of a substance that cannot legally be marketed.
2ACourts-including this Court in United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42
(1950)-have frequently commented on the punishing and deterrent nature
of drug taxes. See, e. g., Sims v. State Tax Comm'n, 841 P. 2d 6, 13 (Utah
1992); Rehg v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 152 Ill. 2d 504, 515, 605 N. E. 2d

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.
KURTH RANCH
Opinion of the Court

V
Because Montana's tax is fairly characterized as punishment, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. In Halper,we recognized that a civil penalty may
be imposed as a remedy for actual costs to the State that are
attributable to the defendant's conduct. 490 U. S., at 452.
Yet as THE CHIEF JUSTICE points out, tax statutes serve
a purpose quite different from civil penalties, and Halper's
method of determining whether the exaction was remedial
or punitive "simply does not work in the case of a tax statute." Post, at 787 (dissenting opinion). Subjecting Montana's drug tax to Halper'stest for civil penalties is therefore
inappropriate. Even if it were proper to permit such a
showing, Montana has not claimed that its assessment in this
case even remotely approximates the cost of investigating,
apprehending, and prosecuting the Kurths, or that it roughly
relates to any actual damages that they caused the State.
And in any event, the formula by which Montana computed
the tax assessment would have been the same regardless of
the amount of the State's damages and, indeed, regardless of
whether it suffered any harm at all.
This drug tax is not the kind of remedial sanction that may
follow the first punishment of a criminal offense. Instead, it
is a second punishment within the contemplation of a constitutional protection that has "deep roots in our history and
jurisprudence," Halper,490 U. S., at 440, and therefore must
be imposed during the first prosecution or not at all. The
proceeding Montana initiated to collect a tax on the possession of drugs was the functional equivalent of a successive
criminal prosecution that placed the Kurths in jeopardy a
second time "for the same offence."
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.

Without giving any indication that it is doing so, the
Court's opinion drastically alters existing law. We have
never previously subjected a tax statute to double jeopardy
analysis, but under today's decision a state tax statute is
struck down because its application violates double jeopardy.
The Court starts off on the right foot. It correctly recognizes that our opinion in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435 (1989), says nothing about the possible double jeopardy
concerns of a tax, as opposed to a civil fine like the one confronted in Halper. Ante, at 777. I agree with the Court's
rejection of the Halper mode of analysis, which, with its effort to determine whether a penalty statute is remedial or
punitive, simply does not fit in the case of a tax statute.
Ante, at 783. But the Court then goes astray and the end
result of its decision is a hodgepodge of criteria-many of
which have been squarely rejected by our previous decisions-to be used in deciding whether a tax statute qualifies
as "punishment."
The Court cites the case of Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S.
391 (1938), as one in which a tax statute was subjected to
double jeopardy analysis. But I agree with the Court's
statement that the "penalty at issue in Mitchell is arguably
better characterized as a sanction for fraud than a tax."
Ante, at 779, n. 16.1 All of our other cases in this area of
II disagree with the Court's statement that the Mitchell Court alternately characterized the penalty there in question as a tax. Ante, at 779,
n. 16. The only language which was used by the Mitchell Court to which
we are referred for this proposition is 303 U. S., at 398, where the Court
uses the word "tax" three times, but only in the context of summarizing
the parties' arguments. As for the first two times, the word "tax" is
mentioned only in discussing the Government's argument that the indictment of Mitchell for willful evasion of the tax in question did not raise the
same issue as did the civil proceeding for the fraud penalty for purposes
of res judicata. The Court simply said:
"Since there was not even an adjudication that Mitchell did not wilfully
attempt to evade or defeat the tax, it is not necessary to decide whether

786

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.
KURTH RANCH
REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting

the law involved claims of double jeopardy where a statute
imposing what was denominated a "civil penalty" was invoked following a separate criminal proceeding based on an
indictment for fraud. In Mitchell, supra, United States ex
rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943), and Rex Trailer Co.
v. United States, 350 U. S. 148 (1956), the double jeopardy
claim was rejected; in United States v. Halper,supra,a double jeopardy claim was upheld for the first time.
The Court, unlike the Court of Appeals below, wisely does
not subject the Montana tax to the Halperanalysis and it is
thus unnecessary to determine whether Halper was correctly decided. See post, at 802-805 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
This clearly is not the "rare case" contemplated by Halper,
nor does this tax involve a "fixed-penalty provision."
Halper, supra, at 449. In Halper,we held that the double
jeopardy test was whether or not the penalty statute there
enabled the Government to recover more than an approximation of its costs in bringing the fraudulent actor to book,
because compensation for the Government's loss is the
avowed purpose of a civil penalty statute. But here we are
confronted with a tax statute, and the purpose of a tax statute is not to recover the costs incurred by the Government
for bringing someone to book for some violation of law, but
is instead either to raise revenue or to deter conduct, or both.
See, e. g., Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S.134, 146 (1938); Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S.506, 513 (1937). Thus, despite
JUSTICE O'CONNOR's attempt to view this case through the
Halper lens, post, at 793, the reasoning quite properly employed in Halper to decide whether the exaction was remesuch an adjudication would be decisive also of this issue of fraud." Ibid.
The word "tax" is mentioned a third time in setting out the respondent's
argument that "this proceeding is barred under the doctrine of double
jeopardy because the 50 per centum addition... is not a tax, but a criminal
penalty intended as punishment for allegedly fraudulent acts." Ibid. It
is telling to note that the Court immediately thereafter denotes the 50%
addition as a "sanction," and not a tax. Id., at 398-399.

dial or punitive simply does not work in the case of a tax
statute. Tax statutes need not be based on any benefit accorded to the taxpayer or on any damage or cost incurred
by the Government as a result of the taxpayer's activities.
Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 622
(1981). Thus, in analyzing the instant tax statute, the inquiry into the State's "damages caused by the [Kurths']
wrongful conduct," post, at 794 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), is
unduly restrictive.
The proper question to be asked is whether the Montana
drug tax constitutes a second punishment under the Double
Jeopardy Clause for conduct already punished criminally.
The Court asks the right question, ante, at 780, but reaches
the wrong conclusion.
Taxes are customarily enacted to raise revenue to support
the costs of government. Cf. ante, at 779-780 ("[T]axes are
typically different [than fines, penalties, and forfeitures]
because they are usually motivated by revenue-raising... purposes"). It is also firmly established that taxes may be enacted to deter or even suppress the taxed activity. Constitutional attacks on such laws have been regularly turned aside
in our previous decisions. In A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton,
292 U. S. 40 (1934), for example, the Court upheld against a
due process challenge a steep excise tax imposed by the
State of Washington on processors of oleomargarine during
the depths of the depression. In Sonzinsky v. United
States, supra, at 513, the Court upheld an annual federal
firearms tax as a valid exercise of the taxing power of Congress. The Court there said "it has long been established
that an Act of Congress which on its face purports to be an
exercise of the taxing power is not any the less so because
the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the
thing taxed." In United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42
(1950), the Court upheld the former federal tax on marijuana
at the rate of $100 per ounce against a challenge that the tax
was a penalty, rather than a true tax. In so doing, the Court

788

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.

REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting

noted that "[i]t is beyond serious question that a tax does not
cease to be valid merely because it regulates, discourages, or
even definitely deters the activity taxed." Id., at 44. And,
as the Court concedes, ante, at 778-779, it is well settled that
the unlawfulness of an activity does not prevent its taxation.
Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, 44 (1968); United
States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 293 (1935).
The Court's opinion today gives a passing nod to these
cases, but proceeds to hold that a high tax rate and a deterrent purpose "lend support to the characterization of the
drug tax as punishment." Ante, at 781. The Court then
discusses "[o]ther unusual features" of the Montana tax
which, it concludes, brands this tax as a criminal penalty.
The Court first points to its conclusion that the so-called
tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime, ibid., a
conclusion that the State disputes, and for good reason.
The relevant provision of the rule, Mont. Admin. Rule
42.34.102(1) (1988), which provides that the tax return "shall
be filed within 72 hours of ...arrest," merely acknowledges2
the practical realities involved in taxing an illegal activity.
Then, quite contrary to the teachings of Marchetti, Constantine, and James v. United States, 366 U. S.213 (1961),
the Court states that the justifications for mixed-motive
taxes-imposed both to deter and to raise revenue-vanish
"when the taxed activity is completely forbidden." Ante,
at 782.
Other potential schemes for taxing illegal drug possession will face
similar pitfalls. Because the activity sought to be taxed is illegal, individuals cannot be expected to voluntarily identify themselves as subject to
2

the tax. The Minnesota scheme cited by respondents provides for the
anonymous purchase of tax stamps prior to, and independent of, any criminal prosecution. Minn. Stat. §297D.01 et seq. (1992). Not surprisingly,
when asked at oral argument "Does Minnesota collect any money off that
scheme ...Not too many stamps being sold?," counsel for respondents
admitted, amidst laughter, that he did not know the answer. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 41.

A second "unusual feature" identified by the Court is that
the tax is levied on drugs that the taxpayer neither owns or
possesses at the time of taxation. But here, the Court exalts form over substance. Surely the Court is not suggesting that the State must permit the Kurths to keep the contraband in order to tax its possession. Cf. Constantine,
supra,at 293 ("It would be strange if one carrying on a business the subject of an excise should be able to excuse himself
from payment by the plea that in carrying on the business
he was violating the law"). And although Montana's "Dangerous Drug Tax" is described as a tax on storage and possession, it is clear from the structure and purpose of the Act
that it was passed for the legitimate purpose of raising revenue from the profitable underground drug business. 1987
Mont. Laws, ch. 563 (preamble).3
I do not dispute the Court's conclusion that an assessment
which is labeled a "tax" could, under some conceivable cir3

The preamble to the 1987 Montana Dangerous Drug Tax Act provides:
"WHEREAS, dangerous drugs are commodities having considerable
value, and the existence in Montana of a large and profitable dangerous

drug industry and expensive trade in dangerous drugs is irrefutable; and
"WHEREAS, the state does not endorse the manufacturing of or trading in dangerous drugs and does not consider the use of such drugs to be
acceptable, but it recognizes the economic impact upon the state of the
manufacturing and selling of dangerous drugs; and
"WHEREAS, it is appropriate that some of the revenue generated by
this tax be devoted to continuing investigative efforts directed toward the
identification, arrest, and prosecution of individuals involved in conducting
illegal continuing criminal enterprises that affect the distribution of dangerous drugs in Montana.
"THEREFORE, the Legislature of the State of Montana does not wish
to give credence to the notion that the manufacturing, selling, and use of
dangerous drugs is legal or otherwise proper, but finds it appropriate in
view of the economic impact of such drugs to tax those who profit from
drug-related offenses and to dispose of the tax proceeds through providing
additional anticrime initiatives without burdening law abiding taxpayers."

chemical abuse assessment and aftercare, and juvenile detention facilities.

cumstances, constitute "punishment" for purposes of the
Double Jeopardy Clause. Ante, at 778, and n. 15, 779. The
Court made a similar finding in United States v. Constantine,
supra, although in the context of a different sort of challenge. At issue in that case was the validity of a special
$1,000 excise tax levied against all persons dealing in the
liquor business contrary to local law. Id., at 289, n. 1. In
striking down the tax as an unlawful penalty rather than a
tax, the Court noted that the assessment was conditioned on
the imposition of a crime, and that it was "highly exorbitant." Id., at 295.
But the Constantinefactors are not persuasive in the present context. As discussed above, I do not find the conditioning of the tax on criminal conduct and arrest to be fatal to
this tax's validity; this characteristic simply reflects the reality of taxing an illegal enterprise. Furthermore, the rate of
taxation clearly supports petitioner here. In Constantine,
the special $1,000 excise tax on the sale of alcohol was 40
times as great when compared to the otherwise applicable
$25 fee for retail liquor dealers such as respondent. Ibid.
When compared to the Montana tax, two points are noteworthy. First, unlike the situation in Constantine, no tax
or fee is otherwise collected from individuals engaged in the
illicit drug business. Thus, an entire business goes without

taxation. Second, the Montana tax is not as disproportionate as the additional excise tax in Constantine. The Court
makes much of the fact that the bulk of the assessmentthat imposed on the low-grade "shake"-was more than eight
times the market value of the drug. Ante, at 780. But the
Court glosses over the fact that the tax imposed on the
higher quality "bud" amounted to only 80% of that product's
4
market value.
4The Kurths were taxed for their possession of 130 ounces of marijuana
"bud," a substance of higher quality than the marijuana "shake." The
Bankruptcy Court found that the bud had a market value of approximately

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)
REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting

After averaging the effective tax rates on the two mari-

juana products, the Court concludes that Montana's tax rate
of four times the market value appears to be "unrivaled."
Ante, at 780, n. 17. That may be so. But the proper inquiry
is not whether the tax rate is "unrivaled," but whether it is
so high that it can only be explained as serving a punitive
purpose. When compared to similar types of "sin" taxes on
items such as alcohol and cigarettes, these figures are not so
high as to be deemed arbitrary or shocking. This is especially so given both the traditional deference accorded to
state authorities regarding matters of taxation, and the fact
that a substantial amount of the illegal drug business will
escape taxation altogether.
In short, I think the Court's conclusion that the tax here
is a punishment is very much at odds with the purpose and
effect of the Montana statute, as well as our previous decisions. After reviewing the structure and language of the
tax provision and comparing the rate of taxation with similar
types of sin taxes imposed on lawful products, I would reach
the contrary conclusion-that the Montana tax has a nonpenal purpose of raising revenue, as well as the legitimate purpose of deterring conduct, such that it should be regarded as
a genuine tax for double jeopardy purposes.
$2,000 per pound. The product was taxed at a minimum rate of $100 per
ounce ($1,600 per pound), or 80% of market value.
5The federal tax on cigarettes is currently at 1.2 cents per cigarette, or
24 cents per package. 26 U. S. C. § 5701(b). While this does not exceed
the cost of a pack of cigarettes, the current proposal to boost the cigarette
tax to 99 cents per pack could lead to a total tax on cigarettes in some

jurisdictions at a rate higher than the 80% rate utilized in this case for
the marijuana bud. That the shake is taxed at a higher rate is consistent
with the effect of a fixed rate tax on a very low-quality, inexpensive product. See 26 U. S. C. § 4131(b)(1) (fixed tax on vaccines, ranging from 6
cents to $4.56 per dose); 26 U. S. C. §4681 (1988 ed., Supp. IV) (fixed tax

on ozone-depleting chemicals).

In an attempt to save their ranch from creditors, the extended Kurth family turned to marijuana farming. "The
business expanded to the largest marijuana growing operation in the State of Montana when shut down by law enforcement authorities in October, 1987." In re Kurth Ranch, 145
B. R. 61, 66 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mont. 1990). The Kurths were convicted and sentenced on various state drug charges.
During the raid on the ranch, authorities found 1,811
ounces of harvested marijuana in the Kurths' possession.
Under Montana law, "[t]here is a tax on the possession and
storage of dangerous drugs," and "each person possessing or
storing dangerous drugs is liable for the tax." Mont. Code
Ann. § 15-25-111(1) (1987). In the case of marijuana, the
tax is 10 percent of the market value of the drugs or $100
per ounce, whichever is greater. § 15-25-111(2). Pursuant
to this law, the Montana Department of Revenue assessed a
tax of $181,000 against the Kurths. The Kurths argue, and
the courts below agreed, that this tax is a second punishment
prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Schiro v.
Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994) (the Clause "'protects
against multiple punishments for the same offense,"' quoting
North Carolinav. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969)).
The government may, of course, tax illegal activity. See,
e. g., Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, 44 (1968). In
fact, we have upheld, as within Congress' taxing authority, a
$100 per ounce tax on marijuana. United States v. Sanchez,
340 U. S. 42, 44 (1950). But the power to tax illegal activity
carries with it the danger that the legislature will use the
tax to punish the participants for engaging in that activity.
This is particularly true of taxes assessed on the possession
of illegal drugs: Because most drug offenses involve the manufacture, possession, transportation, or distribution of controlled substances, the State might use a tax on possession
to punish a participant in a drug crime twice for the same
conduct. We would certainly examine a $100 per ounce fine

the Double Jeopardy Clause. Cf. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 548-549 (1943). Because in my
view there is no constitutional distinction between such a
fine and the tax at issue in this case, a tax imposed on the
possession of illegal drugs is subject to double jeopardy
analysis.
To hold, however, that Montana's drug tax is not exempt
from scrutiny under the Double Jeopardy Clause says nothing about whether imposition of the tax is unconstitutional.
"Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction
in respect to the same act or omission; for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting
a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense."
Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938) (emphasis
added). The Fifth Amendment says "nor shall any person
be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy,"
and a civil proceeding following a criminal prosecution simply is not a second "jeopardy." See post, at 801, and n. 1
(SCALIA, J., dissenting).

But we have recognized that the

Constitution constrains the States' ability to denominate proceedings as "civil" and so dispense with the criminal procedure protections embodied in the Bill of Rights. See, e. g.,
Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 368-369 (1986). Some governmental exactions are so punitive that they may only be
imposed in a criminal proceeding. United States v. Ward,
448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). And because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive criminal proceedings for the
same offense, the government may not sanction a defendant
for conduct for which he has already been punished insofar
as the subsequent sanction is punitive, because to do so
would necessitate a criminal proceeding prohibited by the
Constitution. See generally United States v. Halper, 490
U. S. 435 (1989).

The question, then, is whether Montana's drug tax is punitive. Our double jeopardy cases make clear that a civil sanction will be considered punishment to the extent that it
serves only the purposes of retribution and deterrence, as
opposed to furthering any nonpunitive objective. Id., at
448-450. See also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20
(1979); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168
(1963). This will obtain when, as in Halper, the amount of
the sanction is "overwhelmingly disproportionate" to the
damages caused by the wrongful conduct and thus "is not
rationally related to the goal of making the Government
whole." 490 U. S., at 449, 451.
The State and Federal Governments spend vast sums on
drug control activities. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Fact Sheet: Drug Data Summary 5 (Apr. 1994) (approximately $27 billion in fiscal year
1991). The Kurths are directly responsible for some of these
expenditures-the costs of detecting, investigating, and raiding their operation, the price of prosecuting them and incarcerating those who received prison sentences, and part of
the money. spent on drug abuse education, deterrence, and
treatment. The State of Montana has a legitimate nonpunitive interest in defraying the costs of such activities.
United States v. Halper,supra, at 444-446, and n. 6; see also
United States v. Ward, supra, at 254; One Lot Emerald Cut
Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972); Rex Trailer
Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 153-154 (1956). For example, readily available statistics indicate that apprehension,
prosecution, and incarceration of the Kurths will cost the
State of Montana at least $120,000. See Montana Board of
Crime Control, Per-Unit and Per-Transaction Expenditures
in the Montana Criminal Justice System 8, 15, 19, 21, 22-23,
and Tables 21 and 23 (1993) (Montana Criminal Justice
Expenditures).
But measuring the costs actually imposed by every participant in the illegal drug trade would be, to the extent it is

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

even possible, so complex as to make the game not worth
the candle. Thus, the government must resort to approximation-in effect, it exacts liquidated damages. See Rex
Trailer Co. v. United States, supra, at 153-154 ("The damages resulting from [the government's] injury may be difficult or impossible to ascertain, but it is the function of liquidated damages to provide a measure of recovery in such
circumstances"); United States v. Halper,supra, at 452-453
(KENNEDY, J., concurring) ("Our rule permits the imposition
in the ordinary case of at least a fixed penalty roughly proportionate to the damage caused or a reasonably liquidated
amount"). The Montana Legislature has determined that
$100 per ounce of marijuana is an appropriate estimate of its
costs of drug control, and at least 22 other States have made
a similar determination and tax marijuana at approximately
the same rate.*
The Court of Appeals recognized that imposition of the
drug tax on the Kurths' possession of marijuana would not
be punishment if the sanction bore some rational relationship
to "the staggering costs associated with fighting drug abuse
in this country." In re Kurth Ranch, 986 F. 2d 1308, 1312
(CA9 1993). But the court held that "allowing the state to
impose this tax, without any showing of some rough approximation of its actual damages and costs, would be sanction*See Ala. Code §40-17A-8(1) (1993); Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-28.7-102(1)

ing a penalty which Halper prohibits." Ibid. (emphasis
added). As evidenced by the highlighted phrase, the Court
of Appeals skipped a step in the double jeopardy analysis.
In Halper,we held that determining whether an exaction is
punitive entails a two-part inquiry:
"Where a defendant previously has sustained a criminal
penalty and the civil penalty sought in the subsequent
proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as 'punishment' in the plain meaning of
the word, then the defendant is entitled to an accounting
of the Government's damages and costs to determine if
the penalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment." 490 U. S., at 449-450 (emphasis added).
In other words, the defendant must first show the absefice
of a rational relationship between the amount of the sanction
and the government's nonpunitive objectives; the burden
then shifts to the government to justify the sanction with
reference to the particular case. This bifurcated approach
to the double jeopardy question makes good sense. The presumption of constitutionality to which every state statute is
entitled means in this context that a sanction denominated
as civil must be presumed to be nonpunitive. This presumption would be rendered nugatory if the government were
required to prove that the sanction is in fact nonpunitive
before imposing it in a particular case. Rather, the defendant must show that the sanction may be punitive as applied
to him before the government can be required to justify its
imposition. As we emphasized in Halper, it will be the
"rare case" in which a litigant will succeed in satisfying the
first prong of the constitutional analysis. Id., at 449. We
do not know whether this is such a case because the courts
below improperly faulted the State for failing to prove its
actual damages even though the Kurths have not shown that

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)

the amount of the tax is not rationally related to the government's legitimate nonpunitive objectives.
The Court avoids this problem by asserting that "[s]ubjecting Montana's drug tax to Halper'stest for civil penalties
is ...

inappropriate."

Ante, at 784.

To reach this conclu-

sion, the Court holds that imposition of the drug tax is always punitive, regardless of the nature of the offense or the
offender. The consequences of this decision are astounding.
The State of Montana-along with about half of the other
States-is now precluded from ever imposing the drug tax
on a person who has been punished for a possessory drug
offense. A defendant who is arrested, tried, and convicted
for possession of one ounce of marijuana cannot be taxed
$100 therefor, even though the State's law enforcement costs
in such a case average more than $4,000. See Montana
Criminal Justice Expenditures 24. Moreover, presumably
the State cannot tax anyone for possession of illegal drugs
without providing the full panoply of criminal procedure protections found in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, given the
Court's holding that "[t]he proceeding Montana initiated to
collect a tax on the possession of drugs was the functional
equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution." Ibid.
See United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 248; post, at 807
(SCALIA, J., dissenting).

Today's decision is entirely unnecessary to preserve individual liberty, because the Excessive Fines Clause is available to protect criminals from governmental overreaching.

law-abiding taxpayers, because it will seriously undermine

recompense for the immense costs criminals impose on our
society. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's
unwarranted expansion of our double jeopardy jurisprudence. I would simply vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion and Halper.
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides: "nor shall any person be subject for the same offence
to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."

I
"To be put in jeopardy" does not remotely mean "to be
punished," so by its terms this provision prohibits, not multiple punishments, but only multiple prosecutions. Compare
the proposal of the House of Representatives, for which the
Senate substituted language similar to the current text of
the Clause: "No person shall be subject, except in cases of
impeachment, to more than one punishment or one trial for
the same offence." See 1 Annals of Cong. 434, 753, 767
(1789); Senate Journal, Aug. 24, 1789, 1st Cong., 1st Sess.,
105, 119, 130 (1789). The view that the Double Jeopardy
Clause does not prohibit multiple punishments is, as Justice
Frankfurter observed,
"confirmed by history. For legislation .. .providing
two sanctions for the same misconduct, enforceable in
separate proceedings, one a conventional criminal prosecution, and the other a forfeiture proceeding or a civil
action as upon a debt, was quite common when the Fifth
Amendment was framed by Congress.... It would do
violence to proper regard for the framers of the Fifth
Amendment to assume that they contemporaneously enacted and continued to enact legislation that was offensive to the guarantees of the double jeopardy clause

SCALIA, J., dissenting

which they had proposed for ratification." United
States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 555-556
(1943) (concurring opinion).
The belief that there is a multiple-punishments component
of the Double Jeopardy Clause can be traced to Ex parte
Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874). In that case, the lower court
sentenced Lange to both one year of imprisonment and a
$200 fine for stealing mail bags from the Post Office, under
a statute that authorized a maximum sentence of one year
of imprisonment or a fine not to exceed $200. The Court,
acknowledging that the sentence was in excess of statutory
authorization, issued a writ of habeas corpus. Lange has
since been cited as though it were decided exclusively on the
basis of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see, e. g., North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717, and n. 11 (1969); in fact,
Justice Miller's opinion for the Court rested the decision on
principles of the common law, and both the Due Process and
Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. See
Lange, 18 Wall., at 170, 176, 178. The opinion went out of
its way not to rely exclusively on the Double Jeopardy
Clause, in order to avoid deciding whether it applied to
prosecutions not literally involving "life or limb." See id.,
at 170. It is clear that the Due Process Clause alone suffices
to support the decision, since the guarantee of the process
provided by the law of the land, cf. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.
v. Haslip,499 U. S. 1, 28-29 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment), assures prior legislative authorization for whatever punishment is imposed.
The basis for Lange was hardly clarified when, almost
three-quarters of a century later and in a case involving
nearly identical circumstances (a prisoner who had already
paid a $500 fine was sentenced to prison under a contempt
statute that permitted only a fine or imprisonment), the
Court discharged the prisoner without express reference to
the Double Jeopardy Clause and with only a citation of
Lange. See In re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50, 51-52 (1943). Chief

Justice Stone's dissent in Bradley displays his uncertainty
regarding the doctrinal basis for Lange-as well as his view
that if the basis was the Double Jeopardy Clause it was
wrong: "So far as Ex parte Lange is regarded here as resting
on the ground that it would be double jeopardy to compel
the offender to serve the prison sentence after remission of
the fine on the same day on which it was paid, I think its
authority should be reexamined and rejected." 318 U. S.,
at 53.
Between Lange and our decision five Terms ago in United
States v. Halper,490 U. S. 435 (1989), our cases often stated
that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against both successive prosecutions and successive punishments for the
same criminal offense. See, e. g., North Carolinav. Pearce,
supra, at 717; Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 415 (1980);
Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U. S.493, 498-499 (1984). But the repetition of a dictum does not turn it into a holding, and an
examination of the cases discussing the prohibition against
multiple punishments demonstrates that, until Halper, the
Court never invalidated a legislatively authorized successive punishment. The dispositions were entirely consistent
with the proposition that the restriction derived exclusively
from the due process requirement of legislative authorization. Indeed, some cases expressed the restriction in precisely that fashion. See, e. g., Johnson, supra, at 499, and
n. 8 ("[P]rotection against cumulative punishmen[t] is designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is
confined to the limits established by the legislature"); Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S.333, 344 (1981) ("[T]he question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is
not different from the question of what punishments the
Legislative Branch intended to be imposed"); United States
v. DiFrancesco,449 U. S.117, 139 (1980) ("No double jeopardy problem would have been presented in Ex parte Lange
if Congress had provided that the offense there was punishable by both fine and imprisonment, even though that is mul-

tiple punishment"); Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684,
688 (1980) ("IT]he question whether punishments imposed by
a court after a defendant's conviction upon criminal charges
are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without
determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has
authorized"); id., at 697 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment) ("The only function the Double Jeopardy Clause
serves in cases challenging multiple punishments is to prevent the prosecutor from bringing more charges, and the
sentencing court from imposing greater punishments, than
the Legislative Branch intended") (emphasis in original);
Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977) ("The legislature
remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define
crimes and fix punishments").
To tell the truth, however, until Halper was decided, extending the "no-double-punishments" rule to civil penalties,
it did not much matter whether that rule was a freestanding
constitutional prohibition implicit in the Double Jeopardy
Clause or (as I think to be the case) merely an aspect of the
Due Process Clause requirement of legislative authorization.
Even if it were thought to be the former, the Double Jeopardy Clause's ban on successive criminal prosecutions would
make surplusage of any distinct protection against additional
punishment imposed in a successive prosecution, since the
prosecution itself would be barred.1 (It has never been
imagined, of course, that the commonplace practice of imposing multiple authorized punishments-fine and incarceration-after a single prosecution is unconstitutional. See
'Thus, in the context of criminal proceedings, legislatively authorized
multiple punishments are permissible if imposed in a single proceeding,
but impermissible if imposed in successive proceedings. See Missouri v.
Hunter,459 U. S. 359, 368-369 (1983). United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435, 450 (1989), and the Court's opinion in the present case, see ante, at
778, attempt to preserve that distinction in the context of civil proceedings. But of course the textual basis for it-the Double Jeopardy Clause's
prohibition of successive prosecutions--does not exist: a civil proceeding
is not a second jeopardy. See infra, at 807-808.

802

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.

SCALIA,- J., dissenting

DiFrancesco,supra, at 139.) But a civil proceeding successive to a criminal prosecution is not barred, even if (as in
Halperitself) it has the potential to result in the imposition

of a penalty. See United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms,465 U. S. 354, 362 (1984); One Lot Emerald Cut
Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 235 (1972). Thus, by
extending the no-double-punishments rule to civil penalties,
while simultaneously affirming that it demanded more than
mere fidelity to legislative intent, Halper gave the rule a
breadth of effect it had never before enjoyed.
Halper involved a medical doctor who had already been
convicted and punished under the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. § 287, for filing false medicare claims. The
issue was whether he could then be fined for the same false
claims under the civil provisions of the False Claims Act,
31 U. S. C. §§ 3729-3731. We held that the Double Jeopardy
Clause prevented it, to the extent that the fine exceeded
what was needed to cover "'legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives,"' Halper,490 U. S., at 448, quoting Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979). The Government's
contention in Halper was not that no constitutional prohibition on multiple punishments existed, but rather that it
applied only to punishments meted out in a criminal proceeding. See Brief for United States in United States v.
Halper, 0. T. 1988, No. 87-1383, pp. 11-12, 21-24. I found,
and continue to find, that distinction incoherent: if the Constitution prohibits multiple punishments, the nature of the
proceeding in which punishment is imposed should make
no difference. Accordingly, I joined the Court's unanimous
opinion. I continued to apply the rule of Halper-indeed,I
thought I applied it more faithfully than the Court-in my
dissent the next month in Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376,
388, 393 (1989).
The difficulty of applying Halper's analysis to Montana's

Dangerous Drug Tax has prompted me to focus on the antecedent question whether there is a multiple-punishments

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)
SCALA, J., dissenting

component of the Double Jeopardy Clause. As indicated
above, I have concluded-as did Chief Justice Stone, see In
re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50 (1943), and Justice Frankfurter, see
United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943)that there is not. Instead, the Due Process Clause keeps
punishment within the bounds established by the legislature,
and the Cruel and Unusual Punishments and Excessive
Fines Clauses place substantive limits upon what those legislated bounds may be.2
Of course the conviction that Halper was in error is not
alone enough to justify departing from it. But there is
added to that conviction the knowledge, acquired from brief
experience with the new regime, that the erroneous holding
produces results too strange for judges to endure, and regularly demands judgments of the most problematic sort. As
to the latter: We dodged the bullet in Halper--orperhaps a
more precise metaphor would be that we thrust our lowercourt colleagues between us and the bullet-by leaving it to
the lower courts to determine at what particular dollar level
the civil fine exceeded the Government's "legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives" and thus became a penalty.
See Halper,490 U. S., at 452. In the present case, however,
the alleged punishment is not an adjudicated fine that can be
judicially reduced to a lower level, but rather a tax; and so
we grapple with the different, though no less peculiar, inquiry: When is a tax so high (or so something-else) that it is
a punishment? Surely further enigmas await us.
2

The Excessive Fines Clause-which was rescued from obscurity only
after Halper was decided, see Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544,
558-559 (1993) (first Supreme Court case applying the Clause to in personam criminal proceedings); Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 606618 (1993) (Clause applies to civil forfeitures)-may well support the judgment in Halper. Indeed, it may even explain the judgment in Halper,
since much of the language of that opinion suggests that the Court was
motivated by concern for the harsh consequences of applying a pertransaction penalty to a "prolific but small-gauge offender," 490 U. S., at
449.

And we have also learned from experience that we are
unwilling to take the strong (and not particularly healthful)
medicine that we poured out for ourselves in Halper. Jones
was the first lesson, but even sterner ones are in store. In
the present case, as in Halper itself, we confront the relatively easy task of disallowing a civil sanction because criminal punishment has already been imposed. But many
cases, including one being held for this case, will demand
much more of us: disallowing criminal punishment because
a civil sanction has already been imposed. Although at
least one lower court has optimistically suggested (without
elaborating) that there might be a constitutional difference
between the two situations, see United States v. Newby, 11
F. 3d 1143 (CA3 1993), if there is a constitutional prohibition
on multiple punishments, the order of punishment cannot
possibly make any difference. Accord, United States v.
Sanchez-Escareno,950 F. 2d 193, 200 (CA5 1991). The social
cost of vindicating the fictional, Halper-created multiplepunishments prohibition will be much higher when criminal
penalties are at stake, and we will be no more willing to pay
it (nor should we) than the lower courts have been. Can a
prison inmate who has been disciplined for an altercation
with a guard subsequently be punished criminally for the
same incident? See Newby, supra, at 1145-1146 (answering
yes). Can a person who has paid a $75,000 fine and been

pormanently disbarred from commodity trading because of
trading violations subsequently be sent to jail for the same
violations? See United States v. Furlett,974 F. 2d 839 (CA7
1992) (answering yes). Can a person who has suffered civil
forfeiture for violation of law later be prosecuted criminally
for the same violation? See United States v. Tilley, 18 F.
3d 295 (CA5 1994) (answering yes).
It is time to put the Halper genie back in the bottle, and
to acknowledge what the text of the Constitution makes perfectly clear: the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive

Cite as: 511 U. S. 767 (1994)
SCALIA, J., dissenting

prosecution, not successive punishment. Multiple punishment is of course restricted by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause insofar as its nature is concerned, and by
the Excessive Fines Clause insofar as its cumulative extent
is concerned. Its multiplicity qua multiplicity, however, is
restricted only by the Double Jeopardy Clause's requirement
that there be no successive criminal prosecution, and by the
Due Process Clause's requirement that the cumulative punishments be in accord with the law of the land, i. e., authorized by the legislature.

II

The Court's entire opinion appears to proceed on the
assumption that the relevant question is whether taxes
assessed pursuant to Montana's Dangerous Drug Tax Act
"violate the constitutional prohibition against successive

punishments for the same offense." Ante, at 769. Nonetheless, after 16 pages addressing how Montana's marijuana
tax inflicts punishment, the Court adds, almost as an afterthought: "The proceeding Montana initiated to collect a tax
on the possession of drugs was the functional equivalent of
a successive criminal prosecution that placed the Kurths
in jeopardy a second time 'for the same offence."' Ante,
at 784.
The only conceivable foundation for that statement is the
implicit assumption that any proceeding which imposes "punishment" within the meaning of the multiple-punishments
component of the Double Jeopardy Clause is a criminal
prosecution. That assumption parts company with a long
line of cases, including Halper,without even the courtesy of
a goodbye. Although a few of our cases include statements
to the effect that a proceeding in which punishment is imposed is criminal, see, e. g., Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,
372 U. S. 144, 167 (1963), the criterion of "punishment" for
that purpose is significantly different (and significantly more
deferential to the government) than the criterion applied in

806

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONT. v.

SCALIA, J., dissenting

Halper. United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242 (1980), put it
this way:
"[W]here Congress has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether
the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose
or effect as to negate that intention. In regard to this
latter inquiry, we have noted that 'only the clearest
proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of
a statute on such a ground."' Id., at 248-249, quoting
Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S.' 603, 617 (1960) (citation
omitted).
Halper's focus on whether the sanction serves the goals
,f "retribution and deterrence" is just one factor in the
Kennedy-Ward test, see 372 U. S., at 168-169, and one factor
alone is not dispositive, see Ward, supra, at 250-251.
The greater severity of the "criminal prosecution" test
is in fact precisely why Halper resorted to the multiplepunishments component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The opinion distinguished between the test used to determine "whether proceedings are criminal or civil," 490 U. S.,
at 447, and the more searching analysis thought appropriate
in the multiple-punishments context:
"The Government correctly observes that this Court has
followed this abstract [Kennedy-Ward] approach when
determining whether the procedural protections of the
Sixth Amendment apply to proceedings under a given
statute, in affixing the appropriate standard of proof for
such proceedings, and in determining whether double
jeopardy protections should be applied. See United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 248-251. But while recourse to statutory language, structure, and intent is
appropriate in identifying the inherent nature of a proceeding, or in determining the constitutional safeguards
that must accompany those proceedings as a general

matter, the approach is not well suited to the context of
the 'humane interests' safeguarded by the Double Jeopardy Clause's proscription of multiple punishments."

The Court not only ignores the Kennedy-Ward test and
this portion of Halper, it also does not attempt to reconcile
its conclusion with our decision in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303

U.9.991 (1929):

"Forfeiture of goods or their value and the payment of
fixed or variable sums of money are other sanctions
which have been recognized as enforcible [sic] by civil
proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789. In
spite of their comparative severity, such sanctions have
been upheld against the contention that they are essentially criminal and subject to the procedural rules
governing criminal prosecutions." Id., at 400 (citation
omitted) (citing cases).
Of course, if the Court were correct that the proceeding
below was criminal in nature, there would be no particular
reason to refer to this as a double jeopardy case. Assessment of a criminal punishment in a civil tax proceeding
would violate not only the Double Jeopardy Clause, but all
of the criminal-procedure guarantees of the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments. And it would be invalid whether or not it was
preceded by a traditional criminal prosecution. The Court's
assertion that it would be lawful in isolation, see ante, at
778-779, thus contradicts the Court's contention that it is
"the functional equivalent of a . ..criminal prosecution,"
ante, at 784.
Applying the Kennedy-Ward test to the Montana tax proceeding, I do not find that it constituted a second criminal
prosecution. And since the Montana Legislature authorized

these taxes in additionto the criminal penalties for possession of marijuana, these taxes did not violate that principle
of due process sometimes called the multiple-punishments
component of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Constitution requires nothing more. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
