J. E. B. v. ALABAMA EX REL. T. B.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS OF ALABAMA
No. 92-1239.

Argued November 2, 1993-Decided April 19, 1994

At petitioner's paternity and child support trial, respondent State used
9 of its 10 peremptory challenges to remove male jurors. The court
empaneled an all-female jury after rejecting petitioner's claim that the
logic and reasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79-in which this
Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits peremptory strikes based solely on race-extend to forbid gender-based peremptory challenges. The jury found petitioner to
be the father of the child in question and the trial court ordered him to
pay child support. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed.
Held: The Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual will
be biased in a particular case solely because that person happens to be
a woman or a man. Respondent's gender-based peremptory challenges
cannot survive the heightened equal protection scrutiny that this Court
affords distinctions based on gender. Respondent's rationale-that its
decision to strike virtually all males in this case may reasonably have
been based on the perception, supported by history, that men otherwise
totally qualified to serve as jurors might be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of a man charged in a paternity action, while
women equally qualified might be more sympathetic and receptive to
the arguments of the child's mother-is virtually unsupported and is
based on the very stereotypes the law condemns. The conclusion that
litigants may not strike potential jurors solely on the basis of gender
does not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. So long
as gender does not serve as a proxy for bias, unacceptable jurors may
still be removed, including those who are members of a group or class
that is normally subject to "rational basis" review and those who exhibit
characteristics that are disproportionately associated with one gender.

Opinion of the Court

John F Porter III argued the cause and filed briefs for
petitioner.
Michael R. Dreeben argued the cause for the United
States as amicus curiae urging reversal. With him on the
brief were Solicitor General Days, Acting Assistant Attorneys General Keeney and Turner, and Deputy SolicitorGeneral Bryson.
Lois N. Brasfield, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama,
argued the cause for respondent. With her on the briefs
was William F Prendergast,Assistant Attorney General.*
delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), this Court held
that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governs the exercise of peremptory challenges by a
prosecutor in a criminal trial. The Court explained that although a defendant has "no right to a 'petit jury composed
in whole or in part of persons of his own race,"' id., at 85,
quoting Strauderv. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 305 (1880),
the "defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury
whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory
criteria," 476 U. S., at 85-86. Since Batson, we have reaffirmed repeatedly our commitment to jury selection procedures that are fair and nondiscriminatory. We have recognized that whether the' trial is criminal or civil, potential
jurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to
jury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsored
group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice. See Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991); Edmonson
v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991); Georgiav. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 (1992).

apply equally to gender discrimination, all our recent cases

Opinion of the Court

defining the scope of Batson involved alleged racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Today we
are faced with the question whether the Equal Protection
Clause forbids intentional discrimination on the basis of gender, just as it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race.
We hold that gender, like race, is an unconstitutional proxy
for juror competence and impartiality.

On behalf of relator T. B., the mother of a minor child,
respondent State of Alabama filed a complaint for paternity
and child support against petitioner J. E. B. in the District
Court of Jackson County, Alabama. On October 21, 1991,
the matter was called for trial and jury selection began.
The trial court assembled a panel of 36 potential jurors, 12
males and 24 females. After the court excused three jurors
for cause, only 10 of the remaining 33 jurors were male. The
State then used 9 of its 10 peremptory strikes to remove
male jurors; petitioner used all but one of his strikes to remove female jurors. As a result, all the selected jurors
were female.
Before the jury was empaneled, petitioner objected to the
State's peremptory challenges on the ground that they were
exercised against male jurors solely on the basis of gender,
in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. App. 22. Petitioner argued fhat the logic and
reasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, which prohibits peremptory strikes solely on the basis of race, similarly forbids intentional discrimination on the basis of gender. The court
rejected petitioner's claim and empaneled the all-female jury.
App. 23. The jury found petitioner to be the father of the
child, and the court entered an order directing him to pay
child support. On postjudgment motion, the court reaffirmed its ruling that Batson does not extend to genderbased peremptory challenges. App. 33. The, Alabama

Opinion of the Court

the Equal Protection Clause, particularly where, as here, the
discrimination serves to ratify and perpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilities
of men and women.
II
Discrimination on the basis of gender in the exercise of
peremptory challenges is a relatively recent phenomenon.
Gender-based peremptory strikes were hardly practicable
during most of our country's existence, since, until the 20th
century, women were completely excluded from jury service.2 So well entrenched was this exclusion of women that
in 1880 this Court, while finding that the exclusion of
African-American men from juries violated the Fourteenth
Amendment, expressed no doubt that a State "may confine
the selection [of jurors] to males." Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 310; see also Fay v. New York, 332 U. S.
261, 289-290 (1947).
Many States continued to exclude women from jury service well into the present century, despite the fact that women
attained suffrage upon ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. 8 States that did permit women to serve on
juries often erected other barriers, such as registration requirements and automatic exemptions, designed to deter
women from exercising their right to jury service. See, e. g.,
2

There was one brief exception.

Between 1870 and 1871, women were

permitted to serve on juries in Wyoming Territory. They were no longer
allowed on juries after a new chief justice who disfavored the practice was
appointed in 1871. See Abrahamson, Justice and Juror, 20 Ga. L. Rev.
257, 263-264 (1986).

1In 1947, women still had not been granted the right to serve on juries

in 16 States. See Rudolph, Women on Juries-Voluntary or Compulsory?,
44 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 206 (1961). As late as 1961, three States, Alabama,

Mississippi, and South Carolina, continued to exclude women from jury
service. See Hoyt v. Florida,368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961).

Indeed, Alabama

did not recognize women as a "cognizable group" for jury-service purposes
until after the 1966 decision in White v. Crook, 251 F. Supp. 401 (MD Ala.)

(three-judge court).

Fay v. New York, 332 U. S., at 289 ("[I]n 15 of the 28 states
which permitted women to serve [on juries in 1942], they
might claim exemption because of their sex"); Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961) (upholding affirmative registration
statute that exempted women from mandatory jury service).
The prohibition of women on juries was derived from the
English common law which, according to Blackstone, rightfully excluded women from juries under "the doctrine of
propter defectum sexus, literally, the 'defect of sex."'
United States v. De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433, 1438 (CA9 1992)
(en banc), quoting 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *362.4 In
this country, supporters of the exclusion of women from juries tended to couch their objections in terms of the ostensible need to protect women from the ugliness and depravity
of trials. Women were thought to be too fragile and virginal
to withstand the polluted courtroom atmosphere. See Bailey v. State, 215 Ark. 53, 61, 219 S. W. 2d 424, 428 (1949)
("Criminal court trials often involve testimony of the foulest
kind, and they sometimes require consideration of indecent
conduct, the use of filthy and loathsome words, references to
intimate sex relationships, and other elements that would
prove humiliating, embarrassing and degrading to a lady");

4In England

there was at least one deviation from the general rule that
only males could serve as jurors. If a woman was subject to capital punishment, or if a widow sought postponement of the disposition of her husband's estate until birth of a child, a writ de ventre inspiciendo permitted
the use of a jury of matrons to examine the woman to determine whether
she was pregnant. But even when a jury of matrons was used, the examination took place in the presence of 12 men, who also composed part of
the jury in such cases. The jury of matrons was used in the United States
during the Colonial period, but apparently fell into disuse when the medical profession began to perform that function. See Note, Jury Service for
Women, 12 U. Fla. L. Rev. 224, 224-225 (1959).

Wall. 130, 141 (1873) (concurring opinion) ("[T]he civil law, as
well as nature herself, has always recognized a wide difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man and
woman. Man is, or should be, woman's protector and defender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which
belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the
occupations of civil life.... The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of
wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator"). Cf.
FrontieroV.Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 684 (1973) (plurality
opinion) (This "attitude of 'romantic paternalism'

. . .

put

women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage").
This Court in Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187
(1946), first questioned the fundamental fairness of denying
women the right to serve on juries. Relying on its supervisory powers over the federal courts, it held that women may
not be excluded from the venire in federal trials in States
where women were eligible for jury service under local law.
In response to the argument that women have no superior
or unique perspective, such that defendants are denied a fair
trial by virtue of their exclusion" from jury panels, the
Court explained:
"It is said... that an all male panel drawn from the
various groups within a community will be as truly representative as if women were included. The thought is
that the factors which tend to influence the action of
women are the same as those which influence the action
of men-personality, background, economic status-and
not sex. Yet it is not enough to say that women when
sitting as jurors neither act nor tend to act as a class.
Men likewise do not act like a class ....

The truth is

that the two sexes are not fungible; a community made
up exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on

the other is among the imponderables. To insulate the
courtroom from either may not in a given case make an
iota of difference. Yet a flavor, a distinct quality is lost
if either sex is excluded." Id., at 193-194 (footnotes
omitted).
Fifteen years later, however, the Court still was unwilling
to translate its appreciation for the value of women's contribution to civic life into an enforceable right to equal treatment under state laws governing jury service. In Hoyt v.
Florida,368 U. S., at 61, the Court found it reasonable, "[d]espite the enlightened emancipation of women," to exempt
women from mandatory jury service by statute, allowing
women to serve on juries only if they volunteered to serve.
The Court justified the differential exemption policy on the
ground that women, unlike men, occupied a unique position
"as the center of home and family life." Id., at 62.
In 1975, the Court finally repudiated the reasoning of Hoyt
and struck down, under the Sixth Amendment, an affirmative registration statute nearly identical to the one at issue
in Hoyt. See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975).3
We explained: "Restricting jury service to only special
groups or excluding identifiable segments playing major
roles in the community cannot be .squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial." Id., at 530. The diverse and
representative character of the jury must be maintained
"'partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and partly
because sharing in the administration of justice is a phase
of civic responsibility."' Id., at 530-531, quoting Thiel v.
Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S.217, 227 (1946) (Frankfurter,
5Taylor distinguished Hoyt by explaining that that case "did not involve
a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross
section of the community," 419 U. S., at 534. The Court now, however,
has stated that Taylor "in effect" overruled Hoyt. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828, n.1 (1991).

Taylor relied on Sixth Amendment principles, but the
opinion's approach is consistent with the heightened equal
protection scrutiny afforded gender-based classifications.
Since Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S.71 (1971), this Court consistently has subjected gender-based classifications to heightened scrutiny in recognition of the real danger that government policies that professedly are based on reasonable
considerations in fact may be reflective of "archaic and overbroad" generalizations about gender, see Schlesingerv. Ballard, 419 U. S.498, 506-507 (1975), or based on "outdated
misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home
rather than in the 'marketplace and world of ideas."' Craig
v. Boren, 429 U. S.190, 198-199 (1976). See also Cleburne
v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 441 (1985)
(differential treatment of the sexes "very likely reflect[s]
outmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and
women").
Despite the heightened scrutiny afforded distinctions
based on gender, respondent argues that gender discrimination in the selection of the petit jury should be permitted,
though discrimination on the basis of race is not. Respondent suggests that "gender discrimination in this country...
has never reached the level of discrimination" against
African-Americans, and therefore gender discrimination,
unlike racial discrimination, is tolerable in the courtroom.
Brief for Respondent 9.
While the prejudicial attitudes toward women in this country have not been identical to those held toward racial minorities, the similarities between the experiences of racial minorities and women, in some contexts, "overpower those
differences." Note, Beyond Batson: Eliminating GenderBased Peremptory Challenges, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 1920, 1921

(1992). As a plurality of this Court observed in Frontiero
v. Richardson,411 U. S., at 685:
"[T]hroughout much of the 19th century the position of
women in our society was, in many respects, comparable
to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes.
Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on
juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married
women traditionally were denied the legal capacity to
hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians
of their own children. . . And although blacks were
guaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women were
denied even that right-which is itself 'preservative
of other basic civil and political rights'-until adoption
of the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later."
(Footnote omitted.)
Certainly, with respect to jury service, African-Americans
and women share a history of total exclusion, a history which
came to an end for women many years after the embarrassing
chapter in our history came to an end for African-Americans.
We need not determine, however, whether women or racial
minorities have suffered more at the hands of discriminatory
state actors during the decades of our Nation's history. It
is necessary only to acknowledge that "our Nation has had a
long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination," id., at
684, a history which warrants the heightened scrutiny we
afford all gender-based classifications today. Under our
equal protection jurisprudence, gender-based classifications
require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" in order to
survive constitutional scrutiny. See PersonnelAdministrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 273 (1979). See also
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724
(1982); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 461 (1981).
Thus, the only question is whether discrimination on the
basis of gender in jury selection substantially furthers the
State's legitimate interest in achieving a fair and impartial

Opinion of the Court

trial.6 In making this assessment, we do not weigh the
value of peremptory challenges as an institution against our
asserted commitment to eradicate invidious discrimination
from the courtroom. 7 Instead, we consider whether peremptory challenges based on gender stereotypes provide
substantial aid to a litigant's effort to secure a fair and impars
tial jury.

Far from proffering an exceptionally persuasive justification for its gender-based peremptory challenges, respondent
maintains that its decision to strike virtually all the males
from the jury in this case "may reasonably have been based
upon the perception, supported by history, that men otherwise totally qualified to serve upon a jury in any case might
6 Because we conclude that gender-based peremptory challenges are not
substantially related to an important government objective, we once again
need not decide whether classifications based on gender are inherently
suspect. See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724, n. 9; Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 13 (1975); Harrisv. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510
U. S. 17, 26, n. (1993) (GINSBURG, J., concurring) ("[Ilt remains an open
question whether 'classifications based on gender are inherently suspect' ")
(citations omitted).
7 Although peremptory challenges are valuable tools in jury trials, they
"are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather they are but
one state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury and
a fair trial." Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57 (1992).
8
Respondent argues that we should recognize a special state interest in
this case: the State's interest in establishing the paternity of a child born
out of wedlock. Respondent contends that this interest justifies the use
of gender-based peremptory challenges, since illegitimate children are
themselves victims of historical discrimination and entitled to heightened
scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.
What respondent fails to recognize is that the only legitimate interest
it could possibly have in the exercise of its peremptory challenges is securing a fair and impartial jury. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U. S. 614, 620 (1991) ("[The] sole purpose [of the peremptory challenge]
is to permit litigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact"). This interest does not change with the parties or the
causes. The State's interest in every trial is to'see that the proceedings
are carried out in a fair, impartial, and nondiscriminatory manner.

be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of a
man alleged in a paternity action to be the father of an outof-wedlock child, while women equally qualified to serve
upon a jury might be more sympathetic and receptive to the
arguments of the complaining witness who bore the child."
Brief for Respondent 10. 9
We shall not accept as a defense to gender-based peremptory challenges "the very stereotype the law condemns."
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at 410. Respondent's rationale,
not unlike those regularly expressed for gender-based
strikes, is reminiscent of the arguments advanced to justify
the total exclusion of women from juries.' 0 Respondent of9 Respondent cites one study in support of its quasi-empirical claim that
women and men may have different attitudes about certain issues justifying the use of gender as a proxy for bias. See R. Hastie, S. Penrod, &
N. Pennington, Inside the Jury 140 (1983). The authors conclude: "Neither student nor citizen judgments for typical criminal case materials have
revealed differences between male and female verdict preferences....
The picture differs [only] for rape cases, where female jurors appear to
be somewhat more conviction-prone than male jurors." The majority of
studies suggest that gender plays no identifiable role in jurors' attitudes.
See, e. g., V. Hans & N. Vidmar, Judging the Jury 76 (1986) ("[I]n the
majority of studies there are no significant differences in the way men and
women perceive and react to trials; yet a few studies find women more
defense-oriented, while still others show women more favorable to the
prosecutor"). Even in 1956, before women had a constitutional right to
serve on juries, some commentators warned against using gender as a
proxy for bias. See F. Busch, Law and Tactics in Jury Trials § 143, p. 207
(1949) ("In this age of general and specialized education, availed of generally by both men and women, it would appear unsound to base a peremptory challenge in any case upon the sole ground of sex.. .").
10A manual formerly used to instruct prosecutors in Dallas, Texas, provided the following advice: "'I don't like women jurors because I can't
trust them. They do, however, make the best jurors in cases involving
crimes against children. It is possible that their "women's intuition" can
help you if you can't win your case with the facts."' Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the
Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 210 (1989). Another
widely circulated trial manual speculated:
"If counsel is depending upon a clearly applicable rule of law and if he
wants to avoid a verdict of 'intuition' or 'sympathy,' if his verdict in

fers virtually no support for the conclusion that gender alone
is an accurate predictor of juror's attitudes; yet it urges this
Court to condone the same stereotypes that justified the
wholesale exclusion of women from juries and the ballot
box.'1 Respondent seems to assume that gross generalizations that would be deemed impermissible if made on the
amount is to be proved by clearly demonstrated blackboard figures for
example, generally he would want a male juror.
"[But] women... are desired jurors when plaintiff is a man. A woman
juror may see a man impeached from the beginning of the case to the end,
but there is at least the chance [with] the woman juror (particularly if the
man happens to be handsome or appealing) [that] the plaintiff's derelictions in and out of court will be overlooked. A woman is inclined to forgive sin in the opposite sex; but definitely not her own." 3 M. Belli, Modern Trials §§ 51.67 and 51.68, pp. 446-447 (2d ed. 1982).
11Even if a measure of truth can be found in some of the gender stereotypes used to justify gender-based peremptory challenges, that fact alone
cannot support discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection.
We have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classifications
that rest on imperniissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection
Clause, even when some statistical support can be conjured up for the
generalization. See, e. g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 645
(1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social Security Act classification authorizing benefits to widows but not to widowers despite the fact that the
justification for the differential treatment was "not entirely without empirical support"); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 201 (1976) (invalidating an
Oklahoma law that established different drinking ages for men and
women, although the evidence supporting the age differential was "not
trivial in a statistical sense"). The generalization advanced by Alabama
in support of its asserted right to discriminate on the basis of gender is,
at the least, overbroad, and serves only to perpetuate the same "outmoded
notions of the relative capabilities of men and women," Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 441 (1985), that we have invalidated in other contexts. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677
(1973); Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Craig v. Boren, supra; Mississippi
Univ.for Women v. Hogan, supra. The Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, acknowledges that a shred of truth may
be contained in some stereotypes, but requires that state actors look beyond the surface before making judgments about people that are likely
to stigmatize as well as to perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination.

basis of race are somehow permissible when made on the
basis of gender.
Discrimination in jury selection, whether based on race or
on gender, causes harm to the litigants, the community, and
the individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from participation in the judicial process. The litigants are harmed
by the risk that the prejudice that motivated the discriminatory selection of the jury will infect the entire proceedings.
See Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 628 (discrimination in the courtroom "raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there"). The community is harmed by
the State's participation in the perpetuation of invidious
group stereotypes and the inevitable loss of confidence in our
judicial system that state-sanctioned discrimination in the
courtroom engenders.
When state actors exercise peremptory challenges in reliance on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women. Because these stereotypes have wreaked injustice in so many
other spheres of our country's public life, active discrimination by litigants on the basis of gender during jury selection
"invites cynicism respecting the jury's neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at
412. The potential for cynicism is particularly acute in cases
where gender-related issues are prominent, such as cases involving rape, sexual harassment, or paternity. Discriminatory use of peremptory challenges may create the impression
that the judicial system has acquiesced in suppressing full
participation by one gender or that the "deck has been
stacked" in favor of one side. See id., at 413 ("The verdict
will not be accepted or understood [as fair] if the jury is chosen by unlawful means at the outset").

U. S, at 723 (that a state practice "discriminates against
males rather than against females does not exempt it from
scrutiny or reduce the standard of, review"); cf. Brief for Respondent 9 (arguing that men deserve no protection from
gender discrimination in jury selection because they are not

granted the opportunity to serve on a jury, have the right
not to be excluded summarily because of discriminatory and
stereotypical presumptions that reflect and reinforce pat12 Given

our recent precedent, the doctrinal basis for JUSTICE SCALIA's
dissenting opinion is a mystery. JUSTICE SCALIA points out that the discrimination at issue in this case was directed at men, rather than women,
but then acknowledges that the Equal Protection Clause protects both
men and women from intentional discrimination on the basis of gender.
See post, at 157, citing Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.,
at 723-724. He also appears cognizant of the fact that classifications
based on gender must be more than merely rational, see post, at 160-161;
they must be supported by an "exceedingly persuasive justification,"
Hogan, 458 U. S., at 724. JUSTICE SCALIA further admits that the Equal
Protection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, governs the
exercise of peremptory challenges in every trial, and that potential jurors,
as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to nondiscriminatory
jury selection procedures. See post, at 158-160, citing Batson, Powers,
Edmonson, and McCollum. JUSTICE SCALIA does not suggest that we
overrule these cases, nor does he attempt to distinguish them. He intimates that discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection may be
rational, see post, at 157, but offers no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for it. Indeed, JUSTICE SCALIA fails' to advance any justification for
his apparent belief that the Equal Protection Clause, while prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges, allows discrimination on the basis of gender.. His dissenting opinion thus serves as a tacit admission that, short of overruling a decade of
cases interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the result we reach today
is doctrinally compelled.

terns of historical discrimination. 13 Striking individual
jurors on the assumption that they hold particular views
simply because of their gender is "practically a brand upon
them, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority."
Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 308. It denigrates
the dignity of the excluded juror, and, for a woman, reinvokes a history of exclusion from political participation. 14
The message it sends to all those in the courtroom, and all
those who may later learn of the discriminatory act, is that
certain individuals, for no reason other than gender, are presumed unqualified by state actors to decide important questions upon which reasonable persons could disagree.' 6
13

It is irrelevant that women, unlike African-Americans, are not a numerical minority and therefore are likely to remain on the jury if each side
uses its peremptory challenges in an equally discriminatory fashion. Cf.
United States v. Broussard,987 F. 2d, at 220 (declining to extend Batson
to gender; noting that "[w]omen are not a numerical minority," and therefore are likely to be represented on juries despite the discriminatory use
of peremptory challenges). Because the right to nondiscriminatory jury
selection procedures belongs to the potential jurors, as well as to the litigants, the possibility that members of both genders will get on the jury
despite the intentional discrimination is beside the point. The exclusion
of even one juror for impermissible reasons harms that juror and undermines public confidence in the fairness of the system.
14The popular refrain is that all peremptory challenges are based on
stereotypes of some kind, expressing various intuitive and frequently erroneous biases. See post, at 161. But where peremptory challenges are
made on the basis of group characteristics other than race or gender (like
occupation, for example), they do not reinforce the same stereotypes about
the group's competence or predispositions that have been used to prevent
them from voting, participating on juries, pursuing their chosen professions, or otherwise contributing to civic life. See Babcock, A Place in the
Palladium, Women's Rights and Jury Service, 61 U. Cinn. L. Rev. 1139,
1173 (1993).

IV
Our conclusion that litigants may not strike potential jurors solely on the basis of gender does not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. Neither does it conflict
with a State's legitimate interest in using such challenges in
its effort to secure a fair and impartial jury. Parties still
may remove jurors who they feel might be less acceptable
than others on the panel; gender simply may not serve as a
proxy for bias. Parties may also exercise their peremptory
challenges to remove from the venire any group or class of
individuals normally subject to "rational basis" review. See
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S., at 439442; Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988). Even strikes
based on characteristics that are disproportionately associated with one gender could be appropriate, absent a showing
16
of pretext.
. If conducted properly, voir dire can inform litigants about
potential jurors, making reliance upon stereotypical and pejorative notions about a particular gender or race both unnecessary and unwise. Voir dire provides a means of discovering actual or implied bias and a firmer basis upon which the
try. Post, at 159 (discriminatory peremptory challenges have "coexisted
with the Equal Protection Clause for 120 years"); post, at 160 (there was
a "106-year interlude between our holding that exclusion from juries on
the basis of race was unconstitutional, [Strauder], and our holding that
peremptory challenges on the basis of race were unconstitutional, [Batson]"). We do not dispute that this Court long has tolerated the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, but this is not a reason to continue
to do so. Many of "our people's traditions," see post, at 163, such as de
jure segregation and the total exclusion of women from juries, are now
unconstitutional even though they once coexisted with the Equal Protection Clause.
16For example, challenging all persons who have had military experience would disproportionately affect men at this time, while challenging
all persons employed as nurses would disproportionately affect women.
Without a showing of pretext, however, these challenges may well not be
unconstitutional, since they are not gender or race based. See Hernandez
v. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).

parties may exercise their peremptory challenges intelligently. See, e. g., Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S.
539, 602 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring, in judgment) (voir
dire "facilitate[s] intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges and [helps] uncover factors that would dictate disqualification for cause"); United States v. Witt, 718 F. 2d 1494,
1497 (CA10 1983) ("Without an adequate foundation [laid by
voir dire], counsel cannot exercise sensitive and intelligent
peremptory challenges"). .. .

The experience in the many jurisdictions that have barred
gender-based challenges belies the claim that litigants and
trial courts are incapable of complying with a rule barring
strikes based on gender. See n. 1, supra (citing state and17
federal jurisdictions that have extended Batson to gender),
As with race-based Batson claims, a party alleging gender
discrimination must make a prima facie showing of inten17

Respondent argues that Alabama's method of jury selection would
make the extension of Batson to gender particularly burdensome. In Alabama, the "struck-jury" system is employed, a system which requires
litigants to strike alternately until 12 persons remain, who then constitute
the jury. See Ala. Rule Civ. Proc. 47 (1990). Respondent suggests that,
in some cases at least, it is necessary under this system to continue striking persons from the venire after thelitigants no longer have an articulable reason for doing so. As a result, respondent contends, some litigants
may be unable to come up with gender-neutral explanations for their
strikes.
We find it worthy of note that Alabama has managed to maintain its
struck-jury system even after the ruling in Batson, despite the fact that
there are counties in Alabama that are predominately African-American.
In those counties, it presumably would be as difficult to come up with
race-neutral explanations for peremptory strikes as it would be to advance
gender-neutral explanations. No doubt the voir dire process aids litigants
in their ability to articulate race-neutral explanations for their peremptory
challenges. The same should be true for gender. Regardless, a State's
choice of jury-selection methods cannot insulate it from the strictures
of the Equal Protection Clause. Alabama is free to adopt whatever
jury-selection procedures it chooses so long as they do not violate the
Constitution.

tional discrimination before the party exercising the challenge is required to explain the basis for the strike. Batson,
476 U. S., at 97. When an explanation is required, it need
not rise to the level of a "for cause" challenge; rather, it
merely must be based on a juror characteristic other than
gender, and the proffered explanation may not be pretextual.
See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).
Failing to provide jurors the same protection against gender discrimination as race discrimination could frustrate the
purpose of Batson itself. Because gender and race are overlapping categories, gender can be used as a pretext for racial
discrimination."8 Allowing parties to remove racial minorities from the jury not because of their race, but because of
their gender, contravenes well-established equal protection
principles and could insulate effectively racial discrimination
from judicial scrutiny.

may explain why the majority of the lower court decisions extending Batson to gender involve the use of peremptory challenges to remove minority women. All four of the gender-based peremptory cases to reach the

of minority women.
19 This Court almost a half century ago stated:
"The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in connection with
either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial
jury drawn from a cross-section of the community... This does not mean,
of course, that every jury must contain representatives of all the economic,
social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community;
frequently such complete representation would be impossible. But it does
mean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials without
systematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognition
must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be
found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual
rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of

only furthers the goals of the jury system. It reaffirms the
promise of equality under the law-that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, have the chance to take part
directly in our democracy. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at 407
("Indeed, with the exception of voting, for most citizens the
honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process"). When
persons are excluded from participation in our democratic
processes solely because of race or gender, this promise of
equality dims, and the integrity of our judicial system is
jeopardized.
In view of these concerns, the Equal Protection Clause
prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual will be biased
in a particular case for no reason other than the fact that the
person happens to be a woman or happens to be a man. As

U. S. 718, 724 (1982); ante, at 137-140. I therefore join the
Court's opinion in this case. But today's important blow
against gender discrimination is not costless. I write separately to discuss some of these costs, and to express my belief that today's holding should be limited to the government's use of gender-based peremptory strikes.
Batsan v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), itself was a significant intrusion into the jury selection process. Batson
minihearings are now routine in state and federal trial
courts, and Batson appeals have proliferated as well. Demographics indicate that today's holding may have an even
greater impact than did Batson itself. In further constitutionalizing jury selection procedures, the Court increases the
number of cases in which jury selection-once a sideshowwill become part of the main event.
For this same reason, today's decision further erodes the
role of the peremptory challenge. The peremptory challenge is "a practice of ancient origin" and is "part of our common law heritage." Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U. S. 614, 639 (1991) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The
principal value of the peremptory is that it helps produce
fair and impartial juries. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202,
218-219 (1965); Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving "Its Wonderful Power," 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549-558 (1975). "Peremptory challenges, by enabling each side to exclude those jurors
it believes will be most partial toward the other side, are a
means of eliminat[ing] extremes of partiality on both sides,
thereby assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased
jury." Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S.474, 484 (1990) (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
The peremptory's importance is confirmed by its persistence:
It was well established at the time of Blackstone and continues to endure in all the States. Id., at 481.
Moreover, "[t]he essential nature of the peremptory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reason stated, with-

out inquiry and without being subject to the court's control."
Swain, 380 U. S., at 220. Indeed, often a reason for it cannot
be stated, for a trial lawyer's judgments about a juror's sympathies are sometimes based on experienced hunches and educated guesses, derived from a juror's responses at voir dire
or a juror's "'bare looks and gestures."' Ibid. That a trial
lawyer's instinctive assessment of a juror's predisposition
cannot meet the high standards of a challenge for cause does
not mean that the lawyer's instinct is erroneous. Cf. V.
Starr & M. McCormick, Jury Selection 522 (1993) (nonverbal
cues can be better than verbal responses at revealing a juror's disposition). Our belief that experienced lawyers will
often correctly intuit which jurors are likely to be the least
sympathetic, and our understanding that the lawyer will
often be unable to explain the intuition, are the very reason
we cherish the peremptory challenge. But, as we add, layer
by layer, additional constitutional restraints on the use of the
peremptory, we force lawyers to articulate what we know is
often inarticulable.
In so doing we make the peremptory challenge less discretionary and more like a challenge for cause. We also increase the possibility that biased jurors will be-allowed onto
the jury, because sometimes a lawyer will be unable to provide an acceptable gender-neutral explanation even though
the lawyer is in fact correct that the juror is unsympathetic.
Similarly, in jurisdictions where lawyers exercise their
strikes in open court, lawyers may be deterred from using
their peremptories, out of the fear that if they are unable to
justify the strike the court will seat a juror who knows that
the striking party thought him unfit. Because I believe the
peremptory remains an important litigator's tool and a fundamental part of the process of selecting impartial juries,
our increasing limitation of it gives me pause.
Nor is the value of the peremptory challenge to the litigant
diminished when the peremptory is exercised in a genderbased manner. We know that like race, gender matters. A

plethora of studies make clear that in rape cases, for example, female jurors are somewhat more likely to vote
to convict than male jurors. See R. Hastie, S. Penrod, &
N. Pennington, Inside the Jury 140-141 (1983) (collecting and summarizing empirical studies). Moreover, though
there have been no similarly definitive studies regarding, for
example, sexual harassment, child custody, or spousal or
child abuse, one need not be a sexist to share the intuition
that in certain cases a person's gender and resulting life
experience will be relevant to his or her view of the case.
"'Jurors are not expected to come into the jury box and leave
behind all that their human experience has taught them."'
Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 642 (1980). Individuals are
not expected to ignore as jurors what they know as menor women.
Today's decision severely limits a litigant's ability to act
on this intuition, for the import of our holding is that any
correlation between a juror's gender and attitudes is irrelevant as a matter of constitutional law. But-to say that gender makes no difference as a matter of law is not to say that
gender makes no difference as a matter of fact. I previously
have said with regard to Batson: "That the Court will not
tolerate prosecutors' racially discriminatory use of the peremptory challenge, in effect, is a special rule of relevance, a
statement about what this Nation stands for, rather than a
statement of fact." Brown v. North Carolina,479 U. S. 940,
941-942 (1986) (opinion concurring in denial of certiorari).
Today's decision is a statement that, in an effort to eliminate
the potential discriminatory use of the peremptory, see
Batson, 476 U. S., at 102 (Marshall, J., concurring), gender is
now governed by the special rule of relevance formerly reserved for race. Though we gain much from this statement,
we cannot ignore what we lose. In extending Batson to
gender we have added an additional burden to the state
and federal trial process, taken a step closer to eliminating
the peremptory challenge, and diminished the ability of liti-

gants to act on sometimes accurate gender-based assumptions about juror attitudes.
These concerns reinforce my conviction that today's decision should be limited to a prohibition on the government's
use of gender-based peremptory challenges. The Equal
Protection Clause prohibits only discrimination by state
actors. In Edmonson, supra, we made the mistake of concluding that private civil litigants were state actors when
they exercised peremptory challenges; in Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 50-55 (1992), we compounded the mistake
by holding that criminal defendants were also state actors.
Our commitment to eliminating discrimination from the legal
process should not allow us to forget that not all that occurs
in the courtroom is state action. Private civil litigants are
just that--private litigants. "The government erects the
platform; it does not thereby become responsible for all that
occurs upon it." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 632 (O'CONNOR,
J., dissenting).
Clearly, criminal defendants are not state actors. "From
arrest, to trial, to possible sentencing and punishment, the
antagonistic relationship between government and the accused is clear for all to see....

our priorities," for it means "we have exalted the right of

imprisonment or even death." McCollum, supra, at 61-62

Accordingly, I adhere to my position that the Equal Protection Clause does not limit the exercise of peremptory
challenges by private civil litigants and criminal defendants.
This case itself presents no state action dilemma, for here
the State of Alabama itself filed the paternity suit on behalf
of petitioner. But what of the next case? Will we, in the
name of fighting gender discrimination, hold that the battered wife--on trial for wounding her abusive husband-is a
state actor? Will we preclude her from using her peremptory challenges to ensure that the jury of her peers contains
as many women members as possible? I assume we will,
but I hope we will not.
concurring in the judgment.
I am in full agreement with the Court that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits gender discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. I write to explain my understanding of why our precedents lead to that conclusion.
Though in some initial drafts the Fourteenth Amendment
was written to prohibit discrimination against "persons because of race, color or previous condition of servitude," the
Amendment submitted for consideration and later ratified
contained more comprehensive terms: "No State shall ...
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112,
172-173 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part); B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction, 39th Congress, 1865-1867, pp. 90-91,
97-100 (1914). In recognition of the evident historical fact
that the Equal Protection Clause was adopted to prohibit
government discrimination on the basis of race, the Court
most often interpreted it in the decades that followed in accord with that purpose. In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100
U. S. 303 (1880), for example, the Court invalidated a West
Virginia law prohibiting blacks from serving on juries. In
so doing, the decision said of the Equal Protection Clause:

"What is this but declaring that the law in the States shall
be the same for the black as for the white." Id., at 307.
And while the Court held that the State could not confine
jury service to whites, it further noted that the State could
confine jury service "to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to
persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational
qualifications." Id., at 310. See also Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U. S. 356, 373-374 (1886).
As illustrated by the necessity for the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, much time passed before the Equal Protection
Clause was thought to reach beyond the purpose of prohibiting racial discrimination and to apply as well to discrimination based on sex. In over 20 cases beginning in 1971, however, we have subjected government classifications based on
sex to heightened scrutiny. Neither the State nor any Member of the Court questions that principle here. And though
the intermediate scrutiny test we have applied may not provide a very clear standard in all instances, see Craig v.
Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 221 (1976) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting),
our case law does reveal a strong presumption that gender
classifications are invalid. See; e. g., Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.718 (1982).
There is no doubt under our precedents, therefore, that
the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex discrimination in
the selection of jurors. Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S.357
(1979); Taylor v. Louisiana,419 U. S.522 (1975). The only
question is whether the Clause also prohibits peremptory
challenges based on sex. The Court is correct to hold that
it does. The Equal Protection Clause and our constitutional
tradition are based on .the theory that an individual possesses rights that are protected against lawless action by the
government. The neutral phrasing of the Equal Protection
Clause, extending its guarantee to "any person," reveals its
concern with rights of individuals, not groups (though group
disabilities are sometimes the mechanism by which the State
violates the individual right in question). "At the heart of

the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial [or] sexual ...
class." Metro Broadcasting,Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 602
(1990) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted; internal

quotation marks omitted). For purposes of the Equal Protection Clause, an individual denied jury service because of
a peremptory challenge exercised against her on account of
her sex is no less injured than the individual denied jury
service because of a law banning members of her sex from
serving as jurors. Cf., e. g., Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,
409-410 (1991); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429, 431-432
(1984); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880).
The injury is to personal dignity and to the individual's right
to participate in the political process. Powers, supra,at 410.
The neutrality of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee is
confirmed by the fact that the Court has no difficulty in finding a constitutional wrong in this case, which involves males
excluded from jury service because of their gender.
The importance of individual rights to our analysis
prompts a further observation concerning what I conceive
to be the intended effect of today's decision. We do not prohibit racial and gender bias in jury selection only to encourage it in jury deliberations. Once seated, a juror should not
give free rein to some racial or gender bias of his or her own.
The jury system is a kind of compact by which power is
transferred from the judge to jury, the jury in turn deciding
the case in accord with the instructions defining the relevant
issues for consideration. The wise limitation on the authority of courts to inquire into the reasons underlying a jury's
verdict does not mean that a jury ought to disregard the
court's instructions. A juror who allows racial or gender
bias to influence assessment of the case breaches the compact
and renounces his or her oath.
In this regard, it is important to recognize that a juror sits
not as a representative of a racial or sexual group but as an

individual citizen. Nothing would be more pernicious to the
jury system than for society to presume that persons of different backgrounds go to the jury room to voice prejudice.
Cf. Metro Broadcasting, supra, at 618 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The jury pool must be representative of the community, but that is a structural mechanism for preventing
bias, not enfranchising it. See, e. g., Ballard v. United
States, 329 U. S. 187, 193 (1946); Thiel v. Southern Pacific
Co., 328 U. S. 217 (1946). "Jury competence is an individual
rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the
very heart of the jury system." Id., at 220. Thus, the Constitution guarantees a right only to an impartial jury, not to
a jury composed of members of a particular race or gender.
See Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474 (1990); Strauder, 100
U. S., at 305.
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court
holding that peremptory strikes based on gender violate the
Equal Protection Clause.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

dissenting.

I agree with the dissent of JUSTICE SCALIA, which I have

joined. I add these words in support of its conclusion. Accepting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), as correctly
decided, there are sufficient differences between race and
gender discrimination such that the principle of Batson
should not be extended to peremptory challenges to potential
jurors based on sex.
That race and sex discrimination are different is acknowledged by our equal protection jurisprudence, which accords
different levels of protection to the two groups. Classifications based on race are inherently suspect, triggering "strict
scrutiny," while gender-based classifications are judged
under a heightened, but less searching, standard of review.

society, warranting in some situations a greater need for
protection, whereas the population is divided almost equally
between men and women. Furthermore, while substantial
discrimination against both groups still lingers in our society,
racial equality has proved a more challenging goal to achieve
on many fronts than gender equality. See, e. g., D. Kirp,
M. Yudof, & M. Franks, Gender Justice 137 (1986).
Batson, which involved a black defendant challenging the
removal of black jurors, announced a sea change in the jury
selection process. In balancing the dictates of equal protection and the historical practice of peremptory challenges,
long recognized as securing fairness in trials, the Court
concluded that the command of the Equal Protection Clause
was superior. But the Court was careful that its rule not
"undermine the contribution the challenge generally makes
to the administration of justice." 476 U. S., at 98-99. Batson is best understood as a recognition that race lies at the
core of the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Not
surprisingly, all of our post-Batson cases have dealt with
the use of peremptory strikes to remove black or racially
identified venirepersons, and all have described Batson as
fashioning a rule aimed at preventing purposeful discrimination against a cognizable racial group.* As JUSTICE O'CONNOR once recognized, Batson does not apply "[o]utside the
uniquely sensitive area of race." Brown v. North Carolina,
479 U. S. 940, 942 (1986) (opinion concurring in denial of
certiorari).
Under the Equal Protection Clause, these differences
mean that the balance should tilt in favor of peremptory
challenges when sex, not race, is the issue. Unlike the

Court, I think the State has shown that jury strikes on the
basis of gender "substantially further" the State's legitimate
interest in achieving a fair and impartial trial through the
venerable practice of peremptory challenges. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 212-220 (1965) (tracing the "very old
credentials" of peremptory challenges); Batson, supra, at
118-120 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); post, at 161-162 (SCALIA,
J., dissenting). The two sexes differ, both biologically and,
to a diminishing extent, in experience. It is not merely
"stereotyping" to say that these differences may produce a
difference in outlook which is brought to the jury room. Accordingly, use of peremptory challenges on the basis of sex is
generally not the sort of derogatory and invidious act which
peremptory challenges directed at black jurors may be.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S concurring opinion recognizes several of the costs associated with extending Batson to genderbased peremptory challenges-lengthier trials, an increase
in the number and complexity of appeals addressing jury selection, and a "diminished .

and

Today's opinion is an inspiring demonstration of how thoroughly up-to-date and right-thinking we Justices are in matters pertaining to the sexes (or as the Court would have
it, the genders), and how sternly we disapprove the male
chauvinist attitudes of our predecessors. The price to be
paid for this display-a modest price, surely-is that most of
the opinion is quite irrelevant to the case at hand. The
hasty reader will be surprised to learn, for example, that this
lawsuit involves a complaint about the use of peremptory
challenges to exclude men from a petit jury. To be sure,

SCALIA, J., dissenting

petitioner, a man, used all but one of his peremptory strikes
to remove women from the jury (he used his last challenge
to strike the sole remaining male from the pool), but the
validity of his strikes is not before us. Nonetheless, the
Court treats itself to an extended discussion of the historic
exclusion of women not only from jury service, but also from
service at the bar (which is rather like jury service, in that
it involves going to the courthouse a lot). See ante, at 131136. All this, as I say, is irrelevant,. since the case involves
state action that allegedly discriminates against men. The
parties do not.contest that discrimination on the basis of sex 1
is subject to what our cases call "heightened scrutiny," and
the citation of one of those cases (preferably one involving
men rather than women, see, e. g., Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 723-724 (1982)) is all that
was needed.
The Court also spends time establishing that the use of
sex as a proxy for.particular views or sympathies is unwise
and perhaps irrational. The opinion stresses the lack of statistical evidence to support the widely, held belief that, at
least in certain types of cases, a juror's sex has some statistically significant predictive value as to how the juror will behave. See ante, at 137-139, and n. 9. This assertion seems
to place the Court in opposition to its earlier Sixth Amendment "fair cross-section" cases. See, e. g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, 532, n. 12 (1975) ("Controlled studies...
have concluded that women bring to juries their own perspectives and values that influence both jury deliberation
,

Throughout this opinion, I shall refer to the issue as sex discrimination
rather than (as the Court does) gender discrimination. The word "gender" has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal
characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the
sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine to male. The present case does not involve peremptory strikes exercised on the basis of femininity or masculinity (as far as it appears, effeminate men did not survive, the prosecution's peremptories). The case
involves, therefore, sex discrimination plain and simple.

and result"). But times and trends do change, and unisex is
unquestionably in fashion. Personally, I am less inclined to
demand statistics, and more inclined to credit the perceptions of experienced litigators who have had money on the
line. But it does not matter. The Court's fervent defense
of the proposition iln'y a pas de diffdrence entre les hommes
et les femmes (it stereotypes the opposite view as hateful
"stereotyping") turns out to be, like its recounting of the
history of sex discrimination against women, utterly irrelevant. Even if sex was a remarkably good predictor in certain cases, the Court would find its use in peremptories unconstitutional. See ante, at 139, n. 11; cf. ante, at 148-149
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring).

Of course the relationship of sex to partiality would have
been relevant if the Court had demanded in this case what it
ordinarily demands: that the complaining party have suffered some injury. Leaving aside for the moment the real-

ity that the defendant himself had the opportunity to strike
women from the jury, the defendant would have some cause
to complain about the prosecutor's striking male jurors if
male jurors tend to be more favorable toward defendants in
paternity suits. But if men and women jurors are (as the
Court thinks) fungible, then the only arguable injury from
the prosecutor's "impermissible" use of male sex as the basis
for his peremptories is injury to the stricken juror, not to
the defendant. Indeed, far from having suffered harm, petitioner, a state actor under our precedents, see Georgia v.
McCollum, 505 U. S.42, 50-51 (1992); cf. Edmonson v. LeesviUle Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 626-627 (1991), has himself
actually inflicted harm on female jurors.2 The Court today
21 continue to agree with JUSTICE O'CONNOR that McCollum and Edmondson erred in making civil litigants and criminal defendants state
actors for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. I do not, however,
share her belief that correcting that error while continuing to consider the
exercise of peremptories by prosecutors a denial of equal protection will
make things right. If, in accordance with common perception but con-

presumably supplies petitioner with a cause of action by
applying the uniquely expansive third-party standing analysis of Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 415 (1991), according
petitioner a remedy because of the wrong done to male jurors. This case illustrates why making restitution to Paul
when it is Peter who has been robbed is such a bad idea.
Not only has petitioner, by implication of the Court's own
reasoning, suffered no harm, but the scientific evidence presented at trial established petitioner's paternity with 99.92%
accuracy. Insofar as petitioner is concerned, this is a case
of harmless error if there ever was one; a retrial will do
nothing but divert the State's judicial and prosecutorial resources, allowing either petitioner or some other malefactor
to go free.
The core of the Court's reasoning is that peremptory challenges on the basis of any group characteristic subject to
heightened scrutiny are inconsistent with the guarantee of
the Equal Protection Clause. That conclusion can be
reached only by focusing unrealistically upon individual
exercises of the peremptory challenge, and ignoring the totality of the practice. Since all groups are subject to the
peremptory challenge (and will be made the object of it,
depending upon the nature of the particular case) it is hard
to see how any group is denied equal protection. See id., at
423-424 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Batson v. Kentucky, 476
U. S. 79, 137-138 (1986) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). That
explains why peremptory challenges coexisted with the
Equal Protection Clause for 120 years. This case is a perfect example of how the system as a whole is evenhanded.
While the only claim before the Court is petitioner's complaint that the prosecutor struck male jurors, for every man
trary to the Court's unisex creed, women really will decide some cases

differently from men, allowing defendants alone to strike jurors on the

basis of sex will produce-and will be seen to produce-juries intentionally weighted in the defendant's favor: no women jurors, for example, in a
rape prosecution. That is not a desirable outcome.

struck by the government petitioner's own lawyer struck a
woman. To say that men were singled out for discriminatory treatment in this process is preposterous. The situation would be different if both sides systematically struck
individuals of one group, so that the strikes evinced groupbased animus and served as a proxy for segregated venire
lists. See Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 223-224 (1965).
The pattern here, however, displays not a systemic sex-based
animus but each side's desire to get a jury favorably disposed
to its case. That is why the Court's characterization of respondent's argument as "reminiscent of the arguments advanced to justify the total exclusion of women from juries,"
ante, at 138, is patently false. Women were categorically
excluded from juries because of doubt that they were competent; women are stricken from juries by peremptory challenge because of doubt that they are well disposed to the
striking party's case. See Powers, supra, at 424 (SCALIA,
J., dissenting). There is discrimination and dishonor in the
former, and not in the latter-which explains the 106-year
interlude between our holding that exclusion from juries on
the basis of race was unconstitutional, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880), and our holding that peremptory
challenges on the basis of race were unconstitutional, Batson
v. Kentucky, supra.
Although the Court's legal reasoning in this case is largely
obscured by anti-male-chauvinist oratory, to the extent such
reasoning is discernible it invalidates much more than sexbased strikes. After identifying unequal treatment (by separating individual exercises of peremptory challenge from
the process as a whole), the Court applies the "heightened
scrutiny" mode of equal protection analysis used for sexbased discrimination, and concludes that the strikes fail
heightened scrutiny because they do not substantially further an important government interest. The Court says
that the only important government interest that could be
served by peremptory strikes is "securing a fair and impar-

tial jury," ante, at 137, and n. 8.
It refuses to accept respondent's argument that these strikes further that interest
by eliminating a group (men) which may be partial to male
defendants, because it will not accept any argument based
on "'the very stereotype the law condemns."' Ante, at 138
(quoting Powers, 499 U. S., at 410). This analysis, entirely
eliminating the only allowable argument, implies that sexbased strikes do not even rationally further a legitimate government interest, let alone pass heightened scrutiny. That
places all peremptory strikes based on any group characteristic at risk, since they can all be denominated "stereotypes."
Perhaps, however (though I do not see why it should be so),
only the stereotyping of groups entitled to heightened or
strict scrutiny constitutes "the very stereotype the law condemns"-so that other stereotyping (e. g., wide-eyed blondes
and football players are dumb) remains OK. Or perhaps
when the Court refers to "impermissible stereotypes," ante,
at 139, n. 11, it means the adjective to be limiting rather than
descriptive-so that we can expect to learn from the Court's
peremptory/stereotyping jurisprudence in the future which
stereotypes the Constitution frowns upon and which it does
not.
Even if the line of our later cases guaranteed by today's
decision limits the theoretically boundless Batson principle
to race, sex, and perhaps other classifications subject to
heightened scrutiny (which presumably would include religious belief, see Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246
(1982)), much damage has been done. It has been done, first
and foremost, to the peremptory challenge system, which

Itdoes not seem to me that even this premise is correct. Wise observers have long understood that the appearance of justice is as important as
its reality. If the system of peremptory strikes affects the actual impartiality of the jury not a bit, but gives litigants a. greater belief in that
impartiality, it serves a most important function. See, e.g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *353. In point of fact, that may well be its greater
value.

J. E. B. v. ALABAMA EX REL. T. B.

loses its whole character when (in order to defend against
"impermissible stereotyping" claims) "reasons" for strikes
must be given. The right of peremptory challenge "'is, as
Blackstone says, an arbitrary and capricious right; and it
must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full
purpose."' Lewis v. United States, 146 U. S. 370, 378 (1892),
quoting Lamb v. State, 36 Wis. 424, 427 (1874). See also
Lewis, supra, at 376; United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat.
480, 482 (1827) (Story, J.); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*353. The loss of the real peremptory will be felt most
keenly by the criminal defendant, see Georgia v. McCollum,
505 U. S. 42 (1992), whom we have until recently thought
"should not be held to accept a juror, apparently indifferent, whom he distrusted for any reason or for no reason."
Lamb, supra, at 426. And make no mistake about it: there
really is no substitute for the peremptory. Voir dire (though
it can be expected to expand as a consequence of today's
decision) cannot fill the gap. The biases that go along with
group characteristics tend to be biases that the juror himself does not perceive, so that it is no use asking about them.
It is fruitless to inquire of a male juror whether he harbors
any subliminal prejudice in favor of unwed fathers.
And damage has been done, secondarily, to the entire justice system, which will bear the burden of the expanded
quest for "reasoned peremptories" that the Court demands.
The extension of Batson to sex, and almost certainly beyond,
cf. Batson, 476 U. S., at 124 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), will
provide the basis for extensive collateral litigation, which especially the criminal defendant (who litigates full time and
cost free) can be expected to pursue. While demographic
reality places some limit on the number of cases in which
race-based challenges will be an issue, every case contains a
potential sex-based claim. Another consequence, as I have
mentioned, is a lengthening of the voir dire process that
already burdens trial courts.

SCALIA,

J., dissenting

The irrationality of today's strike-by-strike approach to
equal protection is evident from the consequences of extending it to its logical conclusion. If a fair and impartial
trial is a prosecutor's only legitimate goal; if adversarial trial
stratagems must be tested against that goal in abstraction
from their role within the system as a whole; and if, so tested, sex-based stratagems do not survive heightened scrutiny-then the prosecutor presumably violates the Constitution when he selects a male or female police officer to testify
because he believes one or the other sex might be more convincing in the context of the particular case, or because he
believes one or the other might be more appealing to a predominantly male or female jury. A decision to stress one
line of argument or present certain witnesses before a
mostly female jury-for example, to stress that the defendant victimized women-becomes, under the Court's reasoning, intentional discrimination by a state actor on the basis
of gender.
In order, it seems to me, not to eliminate any real denial
of equal protection, but simply to pay conspicuous obeisance
to the equality of the sexes, the Court imperils a practice
that has been considered an essential part of fair jury trial
since the dawn of the common law. The Constitution of the
United States neither requires nor permits this vandalizing
of our people's traditions.
For these reasons, I dissent.
