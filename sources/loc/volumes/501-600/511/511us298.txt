RIVERS ET AL. v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-938. Argued October 13, 1993-Decided April 26, 1994
Petitioners filed a complaint under, inter alia, 42 U. S. C. § 1981, alleging
that respondent, their employer, had fired them on baseless charges because of their race and because they had insisted on the same procedural
protections in disciplinary proceedings that were afforded white employees. Before the trial, this Court issued Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 171, holding that §1981's prohibition against
racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts does
not apply to conduct that occurs after the formation of a contract and
that does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract
obligations. The District Court relied on Pattersonin dismissing petitioners' discriminatory discharge claims. While their appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) became law, § 101 of
which defines § 1981's "make and enforce contracts" phrase to embrace
all phases and incidents of the contractual relationship, including discriminatory contract terminations. The Court of Appeals ruled, among
other things, that § 1981 as interpreted in Patterson,not as amended by
§ 101, governed the case.
Held: Section 101 does not apply to a case that arose before it was enacted. Pp. 303-314.
(a) Landgraf v. USI Film Products,ante, p. 244, in which this Court
concluded that § 102 of the 1991 Act does not apply to cases arising before its enactment, requires rejection of two of petitioners' submissions
in this case: their negative implication argument based on §§ 402(a),
109(c), and 402(b), see ante, at 257-263, and their argument that Bradley
v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, controls here, rather than the
presumption against statutory retroactivity. Pp. 303-304.
(b) The fact that § 101 was enacted in response to Pattersondoes not
supply sufficient evidence of a clear congressional intent to overcome
the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Even assuming that
§ 101 reflects disapproval of Patterson's § 1981 interpretation, and that
most legislators believed that the case was incorrectly decided and represented a departure from the previously prevailing understanding of
§ 1981's reach, the Act's text does not support petitioners' argument that
§ 101 was intended to "restore" that prior understanding as to cases
arising before the Act's passage. In contrast to the 1990 civil rights

Syllabus
bill that was vetoed by the President, the 1991 Act neither declares its
intent to "restor[e]" protections that were limited by Patterson and
other decisions nor provides that its § 1981 amendment applies to all
proceedings "pending on or commenced after" the date Pattersonwas
decided, but describes its function as "expanding" the scope of relevant
civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to discrimination victims. Taken by itself, the fact that § 101 is framed as a gloss
on § 1981's original "make and enforce contracts" language does not
demonstrate an intent to apply the new definition to past acts. Altering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously
undefined, is a common way of amending statutes, and simply does not
answer the retroactivity question. The 1991 Act's legislative history
does not bridge the textual gap, since the statements that most strongly
support retroactivity are found in the debates on the 1990 bill, and the
statements relating specifically to § 101 are conflicting and unreliable.
Pp. 304-309...
(c) Contrary to petitioners' argument, this Court's decisions do not
espouse a "presumption" in favor of the retroactive application of restorative statutes even in the absence of clear congressional intent. Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187, and Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, distinguished. A restorative purpose may be relevant to whether Congress
specifically intended a new statute to govern past conduct, but an intent
to act retroactively in such cases must be based on clear evidence and
may not be presumed. Since neither § 101 nor the statute of which it is
a part contains such evidence, and since the section creates substantive
liabilities that had no legal existence before the 1991 Act was passed,
§101 does not apply to preenactment conduct. Rather, Patterson
provides the authoritative interpretation of the phrase "make and enforce contracts" in § 1981 before the 1991 amendment went into effect.
Pp. 309-314.

Section 101 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102166, 105 Stat. 1071, defines the term "make and enforce contracts" as used in § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Rev.
Stat. § 1977, 42 U. S. C. § 1981, to include "the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the
enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions
of the contractual relationship." We granted certiorari to
decide whether § 101 applies to a case that arose before it
was enacted. We hold that it does not.

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioners Rivers and Davison were employed by respondent Roadway Express, Inc., as garage mechanics. On
the morning of August 22, 1986, a supervisor directed them
to attend disciplinary hearings later that day. Because they
had not received the proper notice guaranteed by their
collective-bargaining agreement, petitioners refused to attend. They were suspended for two days, but filed grievances and were awarded two days' backpay. Respondent
then held another disciplinary hearing, which petitioners also
refused to attend, again on the ground that they had not
received proper notice. Respondent thereupon discharged
them.
On December 22, 1986, petitioners filed a complaint alleging that respondent had discharged them because of their
race in violation of 42 U. S. C. § 1981.1 They claimed, inter
alia,that they had been fired on baseless charges because of
their race and because they had insisted on the same procedural protections afforded white employees.
On June 15, 1989, before the trial commenced, this Court
announced its decision in Pattersonv. McLean Credit Union,
491 U. S. 164. Pattersonheld that § 1981 "does not apply to
conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract and
which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations." Id., at 171. Relying on Patterson, the District Court held that none of petitioners' discriminatory. discharge claims were covered by § 1981, and
dismissed their claims under that section. After a bench
trial on petitioners' Title VII claims, the District Court
found that petitioners had been discharged for reasons other
than their race, and entered judgment for respondent.
1 Petitioners'

amended complaint also alleged claims against respondent
under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 157, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. § 185(a), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., as well as claims
against their union. Those claims are not before us.

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

On appeal, petitioners contended that the District Court
had misconstrued their complaint: They had not merely
claimed discriminatory discharge, but more specifically had
alleged that respondent had retaliated against them, because
of their race, for attempting to enforce their procedural
rights under the collective-bargaining agreement. Because
that allegation related to "enforcement" of the labor contract,
petitioners maintained, it stated a § 1981 claim even under
Patterson's construction of the statute. While petitioners'
appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act
or Act) became law. Section 101 of that Act provides that
§ 1981's prohibition against racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts applies to all phases and
incidents of the contractual relationship, including discriminatory contract terminations. 2 Petitioners accordingly filed
2

The full text of § 101, which is entitled "Prohibition Against All Racial
Discrimination in the Making And Enforcement of Contracts," reads as
follows:
"Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U. S. C. 1981) is amended"(1) by inserting '(a)' before 'All persons within'; and
"(2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
"(b) For purposes of this section, the term 'make and enforce contracts'
includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions
of the contractual relationship.
"(c) The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of
State law."
Prior to the 1991 amendment, § 1981 provided:
"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."
The history of § 1981, which is sometimes cited as § 1977 of the Revised
Statutes, is set forth in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 168-170, and
n. 8 (1976).

Opinion of the Court

a supplemental brief advancing the argument that the new
statute applied in their case. The Court of Appeals agreed
with petitioners' first contention but not the second. Accordingly, it ruled that § 1981 as interpreted in Patterson,
not as amended by § 101, governed the case and remanded
for a jury trial limited to petitioners' discrimination-incontract-enforcement claim. See Harvis v. Roadway Express, Inc., 973 F. 2d 490 (CA6 1992).
We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 908 (1993), on the sole
question whether § 101 of the 1991 Act applies to cases pending when it was enacted and set the case for argument with
Landgrafv. USI Film Products,ante, p. 244.
II
In Landgraf,we concluded that § 102 of the 1991 Act does
not apply to cases that arose before its enactment. The reasons supporting that conclusion also apply to § 101, and require rejection of two of petitioners' submissions in this case.
First, these petitioners, like the petitioner in Landgraf,
rely heavily on a negative implication argument based on
§§ 402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) of the Act. That argument, however, is no more persuasive as to the application of § 101 to
preenactment conduct than as to that of § 102. See ante,
at 257-263.
Second, petitioners argue that the case is governed by
Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974),
rather than the presumption against statutory retroactivity.
We are persuaded, however, that the presumption is even
more clearly applicable to § 101 than to § 102. Section 102
altered the liabilities of employers under Title VII by subjecting them to expanded monetary liability, but it did not
alter the normative scope of Title VII's prohibition on workplace discrimination. In contrast, because § 101 amended
§ 1981 to embrace all aspects of the contractual relationship,
including contract terminations, it enlarged the category of
conduct that is subject to § 1981 liability.

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Moreover, § 1981 (and hence § 101) is not limited to employment; because it covers all contracts, see, e. g., Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976), Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven
Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S. 431 (1973), a substantial
part of § 101's sweep does not overlap Title VII. In short,
§ 101 has the effect not only of increasing liability but also of
establishing a new standard of conduct.8 Accordingly, for
reasons we stated in Landgraf,the important new legal obligations § 101 imposes bring it within the class of laws that
are presumptively prospective.
III
Petitioners rely heavily on an argument that was not applicable to § 102 of the 1991 Act, the section at issue in Landgraf They contend that § 101 should apply to their case because it was "restorative" of the understanding of § 1981 that
prevailed before our decision in Patterson. Petitioners advance two variations on this theme: Congress' evident purpose to "restore" pre-Pattersonlaw indicates that it affirmatively intended § 101 to apply to cases arising before its
enactment; 4 moreover, there is a "presumption in favor of
application of restorative statutes" to cases arising before
their enactment. Brief for Petitioners 37.
A
Congress' decision to alter the rule of law established in
one of our cases-as petitioners put it, to "legislatively overrul[e]," see id., at 38-does not, by itself, reveal whether
Congress intends the "overruling" statute to apply retroac8Even in the employment context, § 1981's coverage is broader than
Title VII's, for Title VII applies only to employers with 15 or more employees, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e(b), whereas § 1981 has no such limitation.
4See Brief for Petitioners 35 ("Congress sought to restore what it and

virtually all the lower courts thought had been the reach of § 1981 prior
to Patterson").

Opinion of the Court

tively to events that would otherwise be governed by the
judicial decision. 5 A legislative response does not necessarily indicate that Congress viewed the judicial decision as
"wrongly decided" as an interpretive matter. Congress may
view the judicial decision as an entirely correct reading of
prior law-or it may be altogether indifferent to the decision's technical merits-but may nevertheless decide that
the old law should be amended, but only for the future.
Of course, Congress may also decide to announce a new
rule that operates retroactively to govern the rights of parties whose rights would otherwise be subject to the rule
announced in the judicial decision. Because retroactivity
raises special policy concerns, the choice to enact a statute
that responds to a judicial decision is quite distinct from the
choice to make the responding statute retroactive.
Petitioners argue that the structure and legislative history
of § 101 indicate that Congress specifically intended to "restore" prior law even as to parties whose rights would otherwise have been determined according to Patterson'sinterpretation of § 1981. Thus, § 101 operates as a gloss on the
terms "make and enforce contracts," the original language
of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that was before this Court in
Patterson. Petitioners also point to evidence in the 1991
Act's legislative history indicating legislators' distress with
Patterson's construction of § 1981 and their view that our
decision had narrowed a previously established understandCongress frequently "responds" to judicial decisions construing statutes, and does so for a variety of reasons. According to one commentator,
between 1967 and 1990, the Legislature "overrode" our decisions at an
average of "ten per Congress." Eskridge, Overriding Supreme Court

Statutory Interpretation Decisions, 101 Yale L. J.331, 338 (1991). Seldom
if ever has Congress responded to so many decisions in a single piece of
legislation as it did in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

Opinion of the Court

ing of that provision. 6 Taken together, petitioners argue,
this evidence shows that it was Congress' sense that Patterson had cut back the proper scope of § 1981, and that the new
legislation would restore its proper scope. Regardless of
whether that sense was right or wrong as a technical legal
matter, petitioners maintain, we should give it effect by
applying § 101's broader definition of what it means to "make
and enforce" a contract, rather than Patterson's congressionally disapproved reading, to cases pending upon § 101's
enactment.
We may assume, as petitioners argue, that § 101 reflects
congressional disapproval of Patterson's interpretation of
6Thus, for example, the Senate Report on the 1990 civil rights bill that
was passed by Congress but vetoed by the President stated:
"The Pattersondecision sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness
of section 1981, with profoundly negative consequences both in the employment context and elsewhere. As a result of the decision, the more
than 11 million employees in firms that are not covered by Title VII lack
any protection against racial harassment and other forms of race discrimination on the job.

"Since Pattersonwas announced, more than 200 claims of race discrimination have been dismissed by federal courts as a result of the decision.
Statement of Julius LeVonne Chambers, Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (March 9, 1990). Many persons subjected to blatant bigotry lack any means to obtain relief
"The Committee finds that there is a compelling need for legislation to
overrule the Pattersondecision and ensure that federal law prohibits all
race discrimination in contracts." S. Rep. No. 101-315, pp. 12-14 (1990).
Congress' concern with the effects of the Patterson decision in specific
cases, including cases in which plaintiffs had won judgments only to have
them reversed after Pattersoncame down, see S. Rep. No. 315, at 13-14,
doubtless explains why the 1990 legislation contained a special provision
for the reopening of judgments. See Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104,
101st Cong., 2d Sess., § 15(b)(3) (1990); see also Landgraf,ante, at 255-256,
n. 8. Petitioners do not argue that the 1991 Act should be read to reach
cases finally decided.

Opinion of the Court

§ 1981. We may even assume that many or even most legislators believed that Patterson was not only incorrectly decided but also represented a departure from the previously
prevailing understanding of the reach of § 1981. Those assumptions would readily explain why Congress might have
wanted to legislate retroactively, thereby providing relief for
the persons it believed had been wrongfully denied a § 1981
remedy. Even on those assumptions, however, we cannot
find in the 1991 Act any clear expression of congressional
intent to reach cases that arose before its enactment.
The 1990 civil rights bill that was vetoed by the President
contained an amendment to § 1981, identical to § 101 of the
1991 Act, that assuredly would have applied to pending
cases. See Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104, 101st Cong.,
2d Sess., § 12 (1990). See also Landgraf,ante, at 255-256,
n. 8. In its statement of purposes, the bill unambiguously
declared that it was intended to "respond to the Supreme
Court's recent decisions by restoring the civil rights protections that were dramatically limited by those decisions,"
S. 2104, § 2(b)(1) (emphasis added), and the section responding to Pattersonwas entitled "Restoring Prohibition Against
All Racial Discrimination in the Making and Enforcement of Contracts." Id., § 12 (emphasis added).7 More directly, § 15(a)(6) of the 1990 bill expressly provided that the
7

We do not suggest that Congress' use of the word "restore" necessarily

bespeaks an intent to restore retroactively. For example, Congress

might, in response to a judicial decision that construed a criminal statute
narrowly, amend the legislation to broaden its scope; the preamble or legislative history of the amendment might state that it was intended to "restore" the statute to its originally intended scope. In such a situation,
there would be no need to read Congress' use of the word "restore" as an
attempt to circumvent the Ex Post Facto Clause. Instead, "to restore"
might sensibly be read as meaning 'to correct, from now on." The 1990
bill did not suffer from such ambiguity, however, for it contained other
provisions that made pellucidly clear that Congress contemplated the
broader, retroactive kind of "restoration."

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

amendment to § 1981 "shall apply to all proceedings pending
on or commenced after" the date of the Patterson decision.
The statute that was actually enacted in 1991 contains no
comparable language. Instead of a reference to "restoring"
pre-existing rights, its statement of purposes describes the
Act's function as "expanding the scope of relevant civil
rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to
victims of discrimination." 1991 Act, §3(4), 105 Stat. 1071
(emphasis added). Consistently with that revised statement
of purposes, the Act lacks any direct reference to cases arising before its enactment, or to the date of the Pattersondecision. Taken by itself, the fact that § 101 is framed as a gloss
on § 1981's original "make and enforce contracts" does not
demonstrate an intent to apply the new definition to past
acts. Altering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of
amending statutes, and simply does not answer the retroactivity question. Thus, the text of the Act does not support
the argument that § 101 of the 1991 Act was intended to
"restore" prior understandings of § 1981 as to cases arising
before the 1991 Act's passage.
The legislative history of the 1991 Act does not bridge the
gap in the text. The statements that most strongly support
such coverage are found in the debates on the 1990 bill. See
n. 6, supra. Such statements are of questionable relevance
to the 1991 Act, however, because the 1990 provision contained express retroactivity provisions that were omitted
from the 1991 legislation. The statements relating specifically to § 101 of the 1991 Act do not provide reliable evidence
on whether Congress intended to "restore" a broader meaning of § 1981 with respect to pending cases otherwise governed by Patterson'sconstruction of the scope of the phrase
"make and enforce contracts."
Thus, the fact that §101
The legislative history of the 1991 Act reveals conflicting views about
whether § 101 would "restore" or instead "enlarge" the original scope

Opinion of the Court

was enacted in response to Patterson does not supply suffi-

cient evidence of a clear congressional intent to overcome
the presumption against statutory retroactivity.
B
A lack of clear congressional intent would not be disposi-

tive if, as petitioners argue, § 101 is the kind of restorative
statute that should presumptively be applied to pending
cases. Petitioners maintain that restorative statutes do not
implicate fairness concerns relating to retroactivity at least
when, as is the case in this litigation, the new statute simply
enacts a rule that the parties believed to be the law when
they acted.9 Indeed, amici in support of petitioners contend, fairness concerns positively favor application of § 101
to pending cases because the effect of the Pattersondecision
of § 1981. Compare, e. g., '137 Cong. Rec. H9526 (Nov. 7, 1991) (remarks
of Rep. Edwards), with id., at H9543 (Nov. 7, 1991) (remarks of Rep.
Hyde). The history also includes some debate over the proper test for
courts to apply-specifically, the "Bradley" presumption or the "Bowen"
presumption, see Landgraf,ante, at 263-265-to determine the applicability of the various provisions of the Act to pending cases. Compare, e. g.,
137 Cong. Rec. 30340 -(1991) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) (citing Bradley
test), with id., at 29043-29044 (remarks of Sen. Danforth) (favoring Bowen
test). As we noted in Landgraf,ante, at 262-263, the legislative history
reveals that retroactivity was recognized as an.important and controversial issue, but that history falls far short of providing evidence of an agreement among legislators on the subject.
9They point out that respondent has no persuasive claim to unfair
surprise, because, at the time the allegedly discriminatory discharge occurred, the Sixth Circuit precedent held that § 1981 could support a claim

for discriminatory contract termination. See, e. g., Cooper v. North Olinstead, 795 F. 2d 1265, 1270, n. 3 (1986); Leonard v. City of Frankfort Elec.
and Water PlantBd., 752 F. 2d 189,195 (1985). See also Mozee V.American Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F. 2d 929, 941 (CA7 1992) (Cudahy, J., dissenting); Gersman'v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886,
907-908 (CADC 1992) (Wald, J., dissenting), cert. pending, No. 92-1190.
We note, however, that this argument would not apply to any cases arising
after Pattersonwas decided but before the 1991 Act's enactment.'

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

was to cut off, after the fact, rights of action under § 1981
that had been widely recognized in the lower courts, and
under which many victims of discrimination had won damages judgments prior to Patterson. See Brief for NAACP
et al. as Amici Curiae 7-14.
Notwithstanding the equitable appeal of petitioners' argument, we are convinced that it cannot carry the day. Our
decisions simply do not support the proposition that we have
espoused a "presumption" in favor of retroactive application
of restorative statutes. Petitioners invoke Frisbiev. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187 (1870), which involved a federal statute that
enabled Frisbie and others to acquire property they had occupied and thought they owned prior to 1862, when, in another case, this Court held that the original grant of title by
the Mexican Government was void. 10 The new law in effect
"restored" rights that Frisbie reasonably and in good faith
thought he possessed before the surprising announcement of
our decision. In the Frisbie case, however, the question
was whether Congress had the power to enact legislation
that had the practical effect of restoring the status quo
retroactively. As the following passage from Frisbie
demonstrates, there was no question about Congress' actual intent:
"We say the benefits it designed to confer, because we
entertain no doubt of the intention of Congress to secure to persons situated as Frisbie was, the title to their
lands, on compliance with the terms of the act, and if
this has not been done it is solely because Congress

See United States v. Vallejo, 1 Black 541 (1862). In his dissent in that
case, Justice Grier stated that he could not "agree to confiscate the property of some thousand of our fellow-citizens, who have purchased under
this title and made improvements to the value of many millions, on suspicions first raised here as to the integrity of a grant universally acknowledged to be genuine in the country where it originated." Id., at 555-556

Id., at 192

Petitioners also point to Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160
(1865). There, a statute admitting Nevada to the Union had
failed to provide for jurisdiction over cases arising from Nevada Territory that were pending before this Court when
Nevada achieved statehood. We upheld against constitutional attack a subsequent statute explicitly curing the "accidental impediment" to our jurisdiction over such cases. See
id., at 173-175.
In the case before us today, however, we do not question
the power of Congress to apply its definition of the term
"make and enforce contracts" to cases arising before the 1991
Act became effective, or, indeed, to those that were pending
on June 15, 1989, when Pattersonwas decided. The question is whether Congress has manifested such an intent. Unlike the narrow error-correcting statutes at issue in Frisbie
and Freeborn, § 101 is plainly not the sort of provision that
must be read to apply to pending cases "because a contrary
reading would render it ineffective." Landgraf, ante, at
286. Section 101 is readily comprehensible, and entirely effective, even if it applies only to conduct occurring after its
effective date. A restorative purpose may be relevant to
whether Congress specifically intended a new statute to govern past conduct, but we do not "presume" an intent to act
retroactively in such cases." We still require clear evidence
of intent to impose the restorative statute "retroactively."
Section 101, and the statute of which it is a part, does not
contain such evidence.
"The principle that statutes operate only prospectively,
while judicial decisions operate retrospectively, is familiar to
"See N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 27.04, p. 472
(5th ed. 1993) ("The usual purpose of a special interpretive statute is to
correct a judicial interpretation of a prior law which the legislature considers inaccurate. Where such statutes are given any effect, the effect is
prospective only").

every law student," United States v. Security Industrial
Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 79 (1982), and this case illustrates the
second half of that principle as well as the first. Even
though applicable Sixth Circuit precedents were otherwise
when this dispute arose, the District Court properly applied
Patterson to this case. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of
Taxation, 509 U. S.86, 97 (1993) ("When this Court applies
a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the
controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given
full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review
and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule"). 'See also
Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S.349, 372 (1910) ("Judicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a
thousand years") (Holmes, J., dissenting). The essence of
judicial decisionmaking-applying general rules to particular situations-necessarily involves some peril to individual
expectations because it is often difficult to predict the precise application of a general rule until it has been distilled in
the crucible of litigation. See L. Fuller, Morality of Law
56 (1964) ("No system of law-whether it be judge-made or
legislatively enacted-can be so perfectly drafted as to leave
no room for dispute").
Patterson did not overrule any prior decision of this
Court; rather, it held and therefore established that the prior
decisions of the Courts of Appeals which read § 1981 to cover
discriminatory contract termination were incorrect. They
were not wrong according to some abstract standard of interpretive validity, but by the rules that necessarily govern our
hierarchical federal court system. Cf. Brown v. Allen, 344
U. S. 443, 540 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result). It is
this Court's responsibility to say what a statute means, and
once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to
respect that understanding of the governing rule of law. A
judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative state-

Cite as: 511 U. S. .298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

ment of what the statute meant before as well as after the
decision of the case giving rise to that construction. 12 Thus,
Patterson provides the authoritative interpretation of the
phrase "make and enforce contracts" in the Civil Rights Act
of 1866 before the 1991 amendment went into effect on November 21, 1991. That interpretation provides the baseline
for our conclusion that the 1991 amendment would be "retroactive" if applied to cases arising before that date.
Congress, of course, has the power to amend a statute that
it believes we have misconstrued. It may even, within
broad constitutional bounds, make such a change retroactive
and thereby undo what it perceives to be the undesirable
past consequences of a misinterpretation of its work product.
No such change, however, has the force ,of law unless it
is implemented through legislation. Even when Congress
intends to supersede a rule of law embodied in one of our
decisions with what it views as a better rule established in
earlier decisions, its intent to reach conduct preceding the
"corrective" amendment must clearly appear. We cannot
say that such an intent clearly appears with respect to §101.
For this reason, and because it creates liabilities that had no
legal existence before the Act was passed, §101 does not
apply to preenactment conduct.

When Congress enacts a new statute, it has the power to decide when

the statute will become effective. The new statute may govern from the
date of enactment, from a specified future date, or even from an expressly
announced earlier date. But when this Court construes a statute, it is
explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously
since the date when it became law. In statutory cases the Court has no
authority to depart from the congressional command, setting the effective
date of a law that it has enacted. Thus, it is not accurate to say that the
Court's decision in Patterson "changed" the law that previously prevailed
in the Sixth Circuit when this case was filed. Rather, given the structure
of our judicial system, the Patterson opinion finally decided what § 1981.
had always meant and explained why the Courts of Appeals had misinterpreted the will of the enacting Congress.

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
BLACM UN, J., dissenting

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
[For opinion of JUSTICE SCALIA concurring in the judgment, see ante, p. 286.]
JUSTICE BLACKMUN,

dissenting.

For the reasons stated in my dissent in Landgraf v. USI
Film Products, ante, p. 294, I also dissent in this case.
Here, just as in Landgraf,the most natural reading of the
Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, and this Court's
precedents is that § 101 applies to cases pending on appeal
on the statute's enactment date, at least where application of
the new provision would not disturb the parties' vested
rights or settled expectations. This is such a case.
In 1986, when respondent Roadway Express, Inc., discharged petitioners Maurice Rivers and Robert C. Davison
from their jobs as garage mechanics, 42 U. S. C. § 1981, which
gives all persons the same right to "make and enforce contracts," 1 was widely understood to apply to the discriminatory enforcement and termination of employment contracts.
See Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S.454,
459-460 (1975) ("Although this Court has not specifically so
held, it is well settled among the Federal Courts of Appeals-and we now join them-that § 1981 affords a federal
remedy against discrimination in private employment on the
basis of race"). This understanding comports with § 101 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1072, providing that
"the term 'make and enforce contracts' includes the making,
performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and
'Until the 1991 amendment, § 1981 stated: "All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State
and Territory to make and enforce contracts... as is enjoyed by white

citizens ...

"

Cite as: 511 U. S. 298 (1994)
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship." The majority seemingly accepts petitioners' argument that if this Court were
to apply § 101 to their case, "respondent has no persuasive
claim to unfair surprise, because, at the time the allegedly
discriminatory discharge occurred, the Sixth 'Circuit precedent held that § 1981 could support a claim for discriminatory
contract termination." Ante, at 309, n. 9.
Nonetheless, applying a new, supercharged version of our
traditional presumption against retroactive legislation, the
Court concludes that petitioners, whose claim was pending
when this Court announced Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989), are bound by that decision,
which limited § 1981 to contract formation. Patterson's
tenure was--or surely should'have been-brief, as § 101 was
intended to overrule Pattersonand to deny it further effect.
The Court's holding today, however, prolongs the life of that
congressionally repudiated decision. See Estate of Reynolds v. Martin, 985 F. 2d 470, 475-476 (CA9 1993) (denying
application of § 101 to cases pending at its enactment would
allow repudiated decisions, including Patterson, to "live on
in the federal courts for... years").
Although the Court's opinions in this case and in Landgraf
do bring needed claitity to our retroactivity jurisprudence,
they do so only at the expense of stalling the intended application of remedial and restorative legislation. In its effort
to reconcile the "apparent tension," Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990), between Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696
(1974), and Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S.
204 (1988), the Court loses sight of the core purpose of its
retroactivity doctrine, namely, to respect and effectuate new
laws to the extent consistent with congressional intent and
with the vested rights and settled expectations of the parties. In Bradley, a unanimous Court applied an intervening statute allowing reasonable attorney's fees for school-

RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
BLACKMUN, J.,

dissenting

desegregation plaintiffs to a case pending on appeal on the
statute's effective date. The Court observed that the statute merely created an "additional basis or source for the
Board's potential obligation to pay attorneys' fees." 416
U. S., at 721.2 Just as the school board in Bradley was on
notice that it could be liable for attorney's fees, the employer
in this case was on notice-from the prevailing interpretation of § 1981-that it could be liable for damages for a racially discriminatory contract termination. Indeed, in this
case, the employer's original liability stemmed from the very
provision that petitioners now seek to enforce.
In Bowen, by contrast, the Court unanimously interpreted
authorizing statutes not to permit the Secretary of Health
and Human Services retroactively to change the rules for
calculating hospitals' reimbursements for past services provided under Medicare. Although Bowen properly turned on
the textual analysis of the applicable statutes, neither citing
Bradley nor resorting to presumptions on retroactivity, its
broad dicta disfavored the retroactive application of congres-,
sional enactments and administrative rules. See 488 U. S.,
at 208. Bowen is consistent, however, with the Court's analysis in Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), appraising
the "[p]ractical considerations," id., at 640, that counsel
against retroactive changes in federal grant programs and
noting that such changes would deprive recipients of "fixed,
predictable standards." Ibid. Bowen also accords with
Bradley's concern for preventing the injustice that would result from the disturbance of the parties' reasonable reliance.
Thus, properly understood, Bradley establishes a presump2Here, of course, § 101 creates a basis or source-in addition to Title
VII-for the prohibition on racial discrimination in the enforcement of
employment contracts. Title VII makes it illegal for an employer "to fail
or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U. S. C. §2000e-2(a)(1).

J., dissenting

tion that new laws apply to pending cases in the absence
of manifest injustice, and Bowen and Bennett stand for the
corresponding presumption against applying new laws when
doing so would cause the very injustice Bradley is designed
to avoid. 3
Applying these principles here, "[w]hen a law purports to
restore the status quo in existence prior to an intervening
Supreme Court decision, the application of that law to conduct occurring prior to the decision would obviously not frustrate the expectations of the parties concerning the legal
consequences of their actions at that time." Gersman v.
Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886, 907 (CADC 1992)
(dissenting opinion). While § 101 undoubtedly expands the
scope of § 1981 to prohibit conduct that was not illegal under
Patterson,4 in the present context § 101 provides a remedy
for conduct that was recognized as illegal when it occurred,
both under § 1981 and under Title VII. Thus, as far as respondent is concerned, the law in effect when it dismissed
petitioners' claim differs little from the law as amended by
the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and application of § 101 in this
case would neither alter the expectations of the parties nor
disturb previously vested rights. Because I believe that the
most faithful reading of our precedents makes this the appropriate inquiry, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.

An inquiry into the vested rights and settled expectations of the parties is fairer and more sensitive than a mechanical reliance on a substance/
procedure dichotomy. See Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975
F. 2d 886, 906 (CADC 1992) (Wald, J., dissenting); Mozee v. American
Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F. 2d 929, 940-941 (CA7 1992) (Cudahy, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing).
4Not all conduct proscribed by § 101 was also unlawful under Title VII
or other civil rights laws. For example, § 101, unlike Title VII, see 42
U. S. C. §2000e(b), applies to small employers, and even outside the employment context, see, e. g., Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976).
