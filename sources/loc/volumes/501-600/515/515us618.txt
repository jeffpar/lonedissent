FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-226. Argued January 11, 1995-Decided June 21, 1995
Respondent lawyer referral service and an individual Florida attorney
filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging, as
violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Florida Bar (Bar)
Rules prohibiting personal injury lawyers from sending targeted
direct-mail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster. The District Court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs, relying on Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S.
350, and subsequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similar
grounds.
Held: In the circumstances presented here, the Bar Rules do not violate
the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 622-635.
(a) Bates and its progeny establish that lawyer advertising is commercial speech and, as such, is accorded only a limited measure of First
Amendment protection. Under the "intermediate" scrutiny framework
set forth in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n
of N. Y, 447 U. S. 557, a restriction on commercial speech that, like
the advertising at issue, does not concern unlawful activity and is not
misleading is permissible if the government: (1) asserts a substantial
interest in support of its regulation; (2) establishes that the restriction
directly and materially advances that interest; and (3) demonstrates that
the regulation is "'narrowly drawn,"' id., at 564-565. Pp. 622-624.
(b) The Bar's 30-day ban on targeted direct-mail solicitation withstands Central Hudson scrutiny. First, the Bar has substantial interest both in protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury
victims and their loved ones against invasive, unsolicited contact by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that
such repeated invasions have engendered. Second, the fact that the
harms targeted by the ban are quite real is demonstrated by a Bar
study, effectively unrebutted by respondents below, that contains extensive statistical and anecdotal data suggesting that the Florida public
views direct-mail solicitations in the immediate wake of accidents as an
intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 771-772; Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn.,
486 U. S. 466, 475-476; and Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463

tailored to its stated objectives. Moreover, its duration is limited to a
brief 30-day period, and there are many other ways for injured Floridians to learn about the availability of legal representation during that
time. Pp. 624-634.

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
Rules of the Florida Bar prohibit personal injury lawyers
from sending targeted direct-mail solicitations to victims and
their relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster.
This case asks us to consider whether such Rules violate the
First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. We
hold that in the circumstances presented here, they do not.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR

I
In 1989, the Florida Bar (Bar) completed a 2-year study of
the effects of lawyer advertising on public opinion. After
conducting hearings, commissioning surveys, and reviewing
extensive public commentary, the Bar determined that several changes to its advertising rules were in order. In late
1990, the Florida Supreme Court adopted the Bar's proposed
amendments with some modifications. The Florida Bar:
Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the FloridaBarAdvertising Issues, 571 So. 2d 451 (Fla. 1990). Two of these
amendments are at issue in this case. Rule 4-7.4(b)(1) provides that "[a] lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit to
be sent..., a written communication to a prospective client
for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if: (A)
the written communication concerns an action for personal
injury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an accident
or disaster involving the person to whom the communication
is addressed or a relative of that person, unless the accident
or disaster occurred more than 30 days prior to the mailing
of the communication." Rule 4-7.8(a) states that "[a] lawyer
shall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the service: (1) engages in no communication with the
public and in no direct contact with prospective clients in a
manner that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct
if the communication or contact were made by the lawyer."
Together, these Rules create a brief 30-day blackout period
after an accident during which lawyers may not, directly or

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

indirectly, single out accident victims or their relatives in
order to solicit their business.
In March 1992, G. Stewart McHenry and his wholly owned
lawyer referral service, Went For It, Inc., filed this action
for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging
Rules 4-7.4(b)(1) and 4-7.8(a) as violative of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. McHenry alleged that he routinely sent targeted solicitations to accident
victims or their survivors within 30 days after accidents and
that he wished to continue doing so in the future. Went For
It, Inc., represented that it wished to contact accident victims or their survivors within 30 days of accidents and to
refer potential clients to participating Florida lawyers. In
October 1992, McHenry was disbarred for reasons unrelated
to this suit, Florida Bar v. McHenry, 605 So. 2d 459 (Fla.
1992). Another Florida lawyer, John T. Blakely, was substituted in his stead.
The District Court referred the parties' competing summary judgment motions to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that the Bar had substantial government interests,
predicated on a concern for professionalism, both in protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of recent accident
victims and their relatives and in ensuring that these individuals do not fall prey to undue influence or overreaching.
Citing the Bar's extensive study, the Magistrate Judge found
that the Rules directly serve those interests and sweep no
further than reasonably necessary. The Magistrate recommended that the District Court grant the Bar's motion for
summary judgment on the ground that the Rules pass constitutional muster.
The District Court rejected the Magistrate Judge's report
and recommendations and entered summary judgment for
the plaintiffs, 808 F. Supp. 1543 (MD Fla. 1992), relying on
Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350 (1977), and sub-

Opinion of the Court

sequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similar
grounds, McHenry v. FloridaBar,21 F. 3d 1038 (1994). The
panel noted, in its conclusion, that it was "disturbed that
Bates and its progeny require the decision" that it reached,
21 F. 3d, at 1045. We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1289
(1994), and now reverse.
II
A
Constitutional protection for attorney advertising, and for
commercial speech generally, is of recent vintage. Until the
mid-1970's, we adhered to the broad rule laid out in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), that, while the
First Amendment guards against government restriction of
speech in most contexts, "the Constitution imposes no such
restraint on government as respects purely commercial
advertising." In 1976, the Court changed course. In
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, we invalidated a state statute
barring pharmacists from advertising prescription drug
prices. At issue was speech that involved the idea that "'I
will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price."' Id.,
at 761. Striking the ban as unconstitutional, we rejected
the argument that such speech "is so removed from 'any
exposition of ideas,' and from 'truth, science, morality, and
arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the
administration of Government,' that it lacks all protection."
Id., at 762 (citations omitted).
In Virginia Bd., the Court limited its holding to advertising by pharmacists, noting that "[p]hysicians and lawyers ...
do not dispense standardized products; they render professional services of almost infinite variety and nature, with the
consequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deception
if they were to undertake certain kinds of advertising." Id.,
at 773, n. 25 (emphasis in original). One year later, however,
the Court applied the Virginia Bd. principles to invalidate
a state rule prohibiting lawyers from advertising in news-

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

papers and other media. In Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,
supra, the Court struck a ban on price advertising for what
it deemed "routine" legal services: "the uncontested divorce,
the simple adoption, the uncontested personal bankruptcy,
the change of name, and the like." 433 U. S., at 372. Expressing confidence that legal advertising would only be
practicable for such simple, standardized services, the Court
rejected the State's proffered justifications for regulation.
Nearly two decades of cases have built upon the foundation laid by Bates. It is now well established that lawyer
advertising is commercial speech and, as such, is accorded a
measure of First Amendment protection. See, e. g., Shapero
v. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 472 (1988); Zauderer
v. Office of DisciplinaryCounsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,
471 U. S. 626, 637 (1985); In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 199
(1982). Such First Amendment protection, of course, is not
absolute. We have always been careful to distinguish commercial speech from speech at the First Amendment's core.
"'[C]ommercial speech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale
of First Amendment values,' and is subject to 'modes of
regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression."' Board of Trustees of State Univ.
of N. Y v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477 (1989), quoting Ohralik v.
Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978). We have
observed that "'[t]o require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could
invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of
the Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind
of speech."' 492 U. S., at 481, quoting Ohralik, supra, at
456.
Mindful of these concerns, we engage in "intermediate"
scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech, analyzing
them under the framework set forth in Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y, 447 U. S.
557 (1980). Under Central Hudson, the government may

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
Opinion of the Court

freely regulate commercial speech that concerns unlawful activity or is misleading. Id., at 563-564. Commercial speech
that falls into neither of those categories, like the advertising
at issue here, may be regulated if the government satisfies a
test consisting of three related prongs: First, the government must assert a substantial interest in support of its regulation; second, the government must demonstrate that the
restriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances that interest; and third, the regulation must be "'narrowly drawn."' Id., at 564-565.
B
"Unlike rational basis review, the Central Hudson standard does not permit us to supplant the precise interests put
forward by the State with other suppositions," Edenfield v.
Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 768 (1993). The Bar asserts that it has
a substantial interest in protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury victims and their loved ones
against intrusive, unsolicited contact by lawyers. See Brief
for Petitioner 8,25-27; 21 F. 3d, at 1043-1044.1 This interest
obviously factors into the Bar's paramount (and repeatedly
professed) objective of curbing activities that "negatively
affec[t] the administration of justice." The Florida Bar:
Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the FloridaBarAdvertising Issues, 571 So. 2d, at 455; see also Brief for
Petitioner 7, 14, 24; 21 F. 3d, at 1043 (describing Bar's effort "to preserve the integrity of the legal profession").
1

At prior stages of this litigation, the Bar asserted a different interest,
in addition to that urged now, in protecting people against undue influence
and overreaching. See 21 F. 3d, at 1042-1043; cf Shapero v. Kentucky
Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 474-476 (1988); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,
436 U. S.447, 462 (1978). Because the Bar does not press this interest
before us, we do not consider it. Of course, our precedents do not require
the Bar to point to more than one interest in support of its 80-day restriction; a single substantial interest is sufficient to satisfy Central Hudson's
first prong. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 485 (1995)
(deeming only one of the government's proffered interests "substantiar').

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

Because direct-mail solicitations in the wake of accidents are
perceived by the public as intrusive, the Bar argues, the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of Floridians has
suffered commensurately. See Pet. for Cert. 14-15; Brief
for Petitioner 28-29. The regulation, then, is an effort to
protect the flagging reputations of Florida lawyers by preventing them from engaging in conduct that, the Bar maintains, "'is universally regarded as deplorable and beneath
common decency because of its intrusion upon the special
vulnerability and private grief of victims or their families."'
Brief for Petitioner 28, quoting In re Anis, 126 N. J. 448, 458,
599 A. 2d 1265, 1270 (1992).
We have little trouble crediting the Bar's interest as substantial. On various occasions we have accepted the proposition that "States have a compelling interest in the practice
of professions within their boundaries, and ... as part of
their power to protect the public health, safety, and other
valid interests they have broad power to establish standards
for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions." Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,421 U. S. 773, 792
(1975); see also Ohralik, supra, at 460; Cohen v. Hurley, 366
U. S. 117, 124 (1961). Our precedents also leave no room for
doubt that "the protection of potential clients' privacy is a
substantial state interest." See Edenfield, supra, at 769.
In other contexts, we have consistently recognized that
"[the State's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest order
in a free and civilized society." Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S.
455, 471 (1980). Indeed, we have noted that "a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls,
which the State may legislate to protect, is an ability to
avoid intrusions." Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484485 (1988).
Under Central Hudson's second prong, the State must
demonstrate that the challenged regulation "advances the
Government's interest 'in a direct and material way.'"

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476,487 (1995), quoting
Edenfield, supra, at 767. That burden, we have explained,
"'is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather,
a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites
are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to
a material degree."' 514 U. S., at 487, quoting Edenfield,
supra, at 770-771. In Edenfield, the Court invalidated a
Florida ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants (CPA's). We observed that the State Board of Accountancy had "present[ed] no studies that suggest personal
solicitation of prospective business clients by CPA's creates
the dangers of fraud, overreaching, or compromised independence that the Board claims to fear." 507 U. S., at 771.
Moreover, "[tihe record [did] not disclose any anecdotal evidence, either from Florida or another State, that validate[d]
the Board's suppositions." Ibid. In fact, we concluded that
the only evidence in the record tended to "contradic[t], rather
than strengthe[n], the Board's submissions." Id., at 772.
Finding nothing in the record to substantiate the State's allegations of harm, we invalidated the regulation.
The direct-mail solicitation regulation before us does not
suffer from such infirmities. The Bar submitted a 106page summary of its 2-year study of lawyer advertising
and solicitation to the District Court. That summary contains data-both statistical and anecdotal-supporting the
Bar's contentions that the Florida public views direct-mail
solicitations in the immediate wake of accidents as an intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. As
of June 1989, lawyers mailed 700,000 direct solicitations in
Florida annually, 40% of which were aimed at accident victims or their survivors. Summary of the Record in No.
74,987 (Fla.) on Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating
Lawyer Advertising (hereinafter Summary of Record), App.
H, p. 2. A survey of Florida adults commissioned by the
Bar indicated that Floridians "have negative feelings about

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

those attorneys who use direct mail advertising." Magid
Associates, Attitudes & Opinions Toward Direct Mail Advertising by Attorneys (Dec. 1987), Summary of Record, App.
C(4), p. 6. Fifty-four percent of the general population surveyed said that contacting persons concerning accidents or
similar events is a violation of privacy. Id., at 7. A random
sampling of persons who received direct-mail advertising
from lawyers in 1987 revealed that 45% believed that directmail solicitation is "designed to take advantage of gullible or
unstable people"; 34% found such tactics "annoying or irritating"; 26% found it "an invasion of your privacy"; and 24%
reported that it "made you angry." Ibid. Significantly,
27% of direct-mail recipients reported that their regard for
the legal profession and for the judicial process as a whole
was "lower" as a result of receiving the direct mail. Ibid.
The anecdotal record mustered by the Bar is noteworthy
for its breadth and detail. With titles like "Scavenger Lawyers" (The Miami Herald, Sept. 29, 1987) and "Solicitors Out
of Bounds" (St. Petersburg Times, Oct. 26, 1987), newspaper
editorial pages in Florida have burgeoned with criticism of
Florida lawyers who send targeted direct mail to victims
shortly after accidents. See Summary of Record, App. B,
pp. 1-8 (excerpts from articles); see also Peltz, Legal Advertising-Opening Pandora's Box, 19 Stetson L. Rev. 43, 116
(1989) (listing Florida editorials critical of direct-mail solicitation of accident victims in 1987, several of which are referenced in the record). The study summary also includes page
upon page of excerpts from complaints of direct-mail recipients. For example, a Florida citizen described how he was
"'appalled and angered by the brazen attempt"' of a law firm
to solicit him by letter shortly after he was injured and his
fiancee was killed in an auto accident. Summary of Record,
App. I(1), p. 2. Another found it "'despicable and inexcusable"' that a Pensacola lawyer wrote to his mother three
days after his father's funeral. Ibid. Another described
how she was "'astounded"' and then "'very angry"' when

Opinion of the Court

she received a solicitation following a minor accident. Id.,
at 3. Still another described as "'beyond comprehension"'
a letter his nephew's family received the day of the nephew's
funeral. Ibid. One citizen wrote, "'I consider the unsolicited contact from you after my child's accident to be of the
rankest form of ambulance chasing and in incredibly poor
taste.... I cannot begin to express with my limited vocabulary the utter contempt in which I hold you and your
Ibid.
kind.'
In light of this showing-which respondents at no time refuted, save by the conclusory assertion that the Rule lacked
"any factual basis," Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Supplementary Memorandum of Law in No. 92-370Civ. (MD Fla.), p. 5-we conclude that the Bar has satisfied
the second prong of the Central Hudson test. In dissent,
JUSTICE KENNEDY complains that we have before us few
indications of the sample size or selection procedures employed by Magid Associates (a nationally renowned consulting firm) and no copies of the actual surveys employed. See
post, at 640. As stated, we believe the evidence adduced
by the Bar is sufficient to meet the standard elaborated in
Edenfield v. Fane,507 U. S. 761 (1993). In any event, we do
not read our case law to require that empirical data come
to us accompanied by a surfeit of background information.
Indeed, in other First Amendment contexts, we have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to
studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41,
50-51 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560,
584-585 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment), or even,
in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based
solely on history, consensus, and "simple common sense,"
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 211 (1992). Nothing in
Edenfield, a case in which the State offered no evidence or
anecdotes in support of its restriction, requires more. After
scouring the record, we are satisfied that the ban on direct-

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

mail solicitation in the immediate aftermath of accidents, unlike the rule at issue in Edenfield, targets a concrete, nonspeculative harm.
In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals
determined that this case was governed squarely by Shapero
v. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988). Making no
mention of the Bar's study, the court concluded that "'a targeted letter [does not] invade the recipient's privacy any
more than does a substantively identical letter mailed at
large. The invasion, if any, occurs when the lawyer discovers the recipient's legal affairs, not when he confronts the
recipient with the discovery."' 21 F. 3d, at 1044, quoting
Shapero, supra, at 476. In many cases, the Court of Appeals explained, "this invasion of privacy will involve no
more than reading the newspaper." 21 F. 3d, at 1044.
While some of Shapero's language might be read to support the Court of Appeals' interpretation, Shapero differs in
several fundamental respects from the case before us. First
and foremost, Shapero's treatment of privacy was casual.
Contrary to the dissents suggestions, post, at 637-638, the
State in Shapero did not seek to justify its regulation as a
measure undertaken to prevent lawyers' invasions of privacy
interests. See generally Brief for Respondent in Shapero v.
Kentucky Bar Assn., 0. T. 1987, No. 87-16. Rather, the
State focused exclusively on the special dangers of overreaching inhering in targeted solicitations. Ibid. Second,
in contrast to this case, Shapero dealt with a broad ban on
all direct-mail solicitations, whatever the time frame and
whoever the recipient. Finally, the State in Shapero assembled no evidence attempting to demonstrate any actual harm
caused by targeted direct mail. The Court rejected the
State's effort to justify a prophylactic ban on the basis of
blanket, untested assertions of undue influence and overreaching. 486 U.S., at 475. Because the State did not
make a privacy-based argument at all, its empirical showing
on that issue was similarly infirm.

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
Opinion of the Court

We find the Court's perfunctory treatment of privacy in
Shapero to be of little utility in assessing this ban on targeted solicitation of victims in the immediate aftermath of
accidents. While it is undoubtedly true that many people
find the image of lawyers sifting through accident and police
reports in pursuit of prospective clients unpalatable and invasive, this case targets a different kind of intrusion. The
Bar has argued, and the record reflects, that a principal purpose of the ban is "protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of [Florida's] citizens from crass commercial intrusion
by attorneys upon their personal grief in times of trauma."
Brief for Petitioner 8; cf. Summary of Record, App. I(1) (citizen commentary describing outrage at lawyers' timing in
sending solicitation letters). The intrusion targeted by the
Bar's regulation stems not from the fact that a lawyer has
learned about an accident or disaster (as the Court of Appeals notes, in many instances a lawyer need only read the
newspaper to glean this information), but from the lawyer's
confrontation of victims or relatives with such information,
while wounds are still open, in order to solicit their business.
In this respect, an untargeted letter mailed to society at
large is different in kind from a targeted solicitation; the
untargeted letter involves no willful or knowing affront to or
invasion of the tranquility of bereaved or injured individuals
and simply does not cause the same kind of reputational
harm to the profession unearthed by the Bar's study.
Nor do we find Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463
U. S. 60 (1983), dispositive of the issue, despite any superficial
resemblance. In Bolger, we rejected the Federal Government's paternalistic effort to ban potentially "offensive" and
"intrusive" direct-mail advertisements for contraceptives.
Minimizing the Government's allegations of harm, we reasoned that "[r]ecipients of objectionable mailings . . . may
'"effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities
Id., at 72, quoting Consimply by averting their eyes."'

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

solidated Edison Co. of N. Y v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y, 447 U. S. 530, 542 (1980), in turn quoting Cohen v. California, 403 U. S.15, 21 (1971). We found that the "'short,
though regular, journey from mail box to trash can ... is
an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned."' 463 U. S., at 72 (ellipses in original), quoting
Lamont v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 269 F. Supp.
880, 883 (SDNY), summarily aff'd, 386 F. 2d 449 (CA2 1967).
Concluding that citizens have at their disposal ample means
of averting any substantial injury inhering in the delivery of
objectionable contraceptive material, we deemed the State's
intercession unnecessary and unduly restrictive.
Here, in contrast, the harm targeted by the Bar cannot be
eliminated by a brief journey to the trash can. The purpose
of the 30-day targeted direct-mail ban is to forestall the outrage and irritation with the state-licensed legal profession
that the practice of direct solicitation only days after accidents has engendered. The Bar is concerned not with citizens' "offense" in the abstract, see post, at 638-639, but with
the demonstrable detrimental effects that such "offense" has
on the profession it regulates. See Brief for Petitioner 7,
14, 24, 28.2 Moreover, the harm posited by the Bar is as
much a function of simple receipt of targeted solicitations
within days of accidents as it is a function of the letters'
contents. Throwing the letter away shortly after opening it
may minimize the latter intrusion, but it does little to combat the former. We see no basis in Bolger, nor in the
other, similar cases cited by the dissent, post, at 638-639,
for dismissing the Bar's assertions of harm, particularly
this nuance altogether, the dissent asserts apocalyptically that
we are "unsettl[ing] leading First Amendment precedents," post, at 635,
639-640. We do no such thing. There is an obvious difference between
situations in which the government acts in its own interests, or on behalf
of entities it regulates, and situations in which the government is motivated primarily by paternalism. The cases cited by the dissent, post, at
638-639, focus on the latter situation.
2Missing

Opinion of the Court

given the unrefuted empirical and anecdotal basis for the
Bar's conclusions.
Passing to Central Hudson's third prong, we examine the
relationship between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve them. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of
N. Y v. Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. With respect to this prong,
the differences between commercial speech and noncommercial speech are manifest. In Fox, we made clear that the
"least restrictive means" test has no role in the commercial
speech context. Ibid. "What our decisions require," instead, "is a 'fit' between the legislature's ends and the means
chosen to accomplish those ends,' a fit that is not necessarily
perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the
single best disposition but one whose scope is 'in proportion
to the interest served,' that employs not necessarily the least
restrictive means but . . . a means narrowly tailored to
achieve the desired objective." Ibid. (citations omitted).
Of course, we do not equate this test with the less rigorous
obstacles of rational basis review; in Cincinnativ. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417, n. 13 (1993), for example,
we observed that the existence of "numerous and obvious
less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech ... is certainly a relevant consideration in
determining whether the 'fit' between ends and means is
reasonable."
Respondents levy a great deal of criticism, echoed in the
dissent, post, at 642-644, at the scope of the Bar's restriction
on targeted mail. "[B]y prohibiting written communications
to all people, whatever their state of mind," respondents
charge, the Rule "keeps useful information from those accident victims who are ready, willing and able to utilize a lawyer's advice." Brief for Respondents 14. This criticism
may be parsed into two components. First, the Rule does
not distinguish between victims in terms of the severity of
their injuries. According to respondents, the Rule is unconstitutionally overinclusive insofar as it bans targeted mail-

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

ings even to citizens whose injuries or grief are relatively
minor. Id., at 15. Second, the Rule may prevent citizens
from learning about their legal options, particularly at a time
when other actors-opposing counsel and insurance adjusters-may be clamoring for victims' attentions. Any benefit
arising from the Bar's regulation, respondents implicitly contend, is outweighed by these costs.
We are not persuaded by respondents' allegations of constitutional infirmity. We find little deficiency in the ban's
failure to distinguish among injured Floridians by the severity of their pain or the intensity of their grief. Indeed, it is
hard to imagine the contours of a regulation that might satisfy respondents on this score. Rather than drawing difficult lines on the basis that some injuries are "severe" and
some situations appropriate (and others, presumably, inappropriate) for grief, anger, or emotion, the Bar has crafted a
ban applicable to all postaccident or disaster solicitations for
a brief 30-day period. Unlike respondents, we do not see
"numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives" to
Florida's short temporal ban. Cincinnati, supra, at 417,
n. 13. The Bar's rule is reasonably well tailored to its stated
objective of eliminating targeted mailings whose type
and timing are a source of distress to Floridians, distress
that has caused many of them to lose respect for the legal
profession.
Respondents' second point would have force if the Bar's
Rule were not limited to a brief period and if there were not
many other ways for injured Floridians to learn about the
availability of legal representation during that time. Our
lawyer advertising cases have afforded lawyers a great deal
of leeway to devise innovative ways to attract new business.
Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media.
They may rent space on billboards. They may send untargeted letters to the general population, or to discrete segments thereof. There are, of course, pages upon pages de-

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
Opinion of the Court

voted to lawyers in the Yellow Pages of Florida telephone
directories. These listings are organized alphabetically and
by area of specialty. See generally Rule 4-7.2(a), Rules
Regulating The Florida Bar ("[A] lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory,
legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, billboards and
other signs, radio, television, and recorded messages the
public may access by dialing a telephone number, or through
written communication not involving solicitation as defined
in rule 4-7.4"); The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend the
Rules Regulating the FloridaBar-Advertising Issues, 571
So. 2d, at 461. These ample alternative channels for receipt
of information about the availability of legal representation
during the 30-day period following accidents may explain
why, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by those favoring (as well as opposing)
unrestricted direct-mail solicitation, respondents have not
pointed to-and we have not independently found-a single
example of an individual case in which immediate solicitation
helped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days brought
about, the harms that concern the dissent, see post, at 643.
In fact, the record contains considerable empirical survey
information suggesting that Floridians have little difficulty
finding a lawyer when they need one. See, e. g., Summary
of Record, App. C(4), p. 7; id., App. C(5), p. 8. Finding no
basis to question the commonsense conclusion that the many
alternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Florida's regulation.
III
Speech by professionals obviously has many dimensions.
There are circumstances in which we will accord speech by
attorneys on public issues and matters of legal representation the strongest protection our Constitution has to offer.
See, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U. S. 1030
(1991); In re Primus, 436 U. S.412 (1978). This case, how-

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

ever, concerns pure commercial advertising, for which we
have always reserved a lesser degree of protection under the
First Amendment. Particularly because the standards and
conduct of state-licensed lawyers have traditionally been
subject to extensive regulation by the States, it is all the
more appropriate that we limit our scrutiny of state regulations to a level commensurate with the "'subordinate position"' of commercial speech in the scale of First Amendment
values. Fox, 492 U. S., at 477, quoting Ohralik, 436 U. S.,
at 456.
We believe that the Bar's 30-day restriction on targeted
direct-mail solicitation of accident victims and their relatives
withstands scrutiny under the three-pronged Central Hudson test that we have devised for this context. The Bar
has substantial interest both in protecting injured Floridians
from invasive conduct by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that such repeated invasions have engendered. The Bar's proffered study, unrebutted by respondents below, provides evidence indicating that
the harms it targets are far from illusory. The palliative
devised by the Bar to address these harms is narrow both in
scope and in duration. The Constitution, in our view, requires nothing more.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
Reversed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY,
TICE SOUTER,

with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUS-

and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.

Attorneys who communicate their willingness to assist potential clients are engaged in speech protected by the First
and Fourteenth Amendments. That principle has been understood since Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350
(1977). The Court today undercuts this guarantee in an important class of cases and unsettles leading First Amendment precedents, at the expense of those victims most in
need of legal assistance. With all respect for the Court, in

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

my view its solicitude for the privacy of victims and its concern for our profession are misplaced and self-defeating, even
upon the Court's own premises.
I take it to be uncontroverted that when an accident
results in death or injury, it is often urgent at once to investigate the occurrence, identify witnesses, and preserve
evidence. Vital interests in speech and expression are,
therefore, at stake when by law an attorney cannot direct a
letter to the victim or the family explaining this simple fact
and offering competent legal assistance. Meanwhile, represented and better informed parties, or parties who have been
solicited in ways more sophisticated and indirect, may be at
work. Indeed, these parties, either themselves or by their
attorneys, investigators, and adjusters, are free to contact
the unrepresented persons to gather evidence or offer settlement. This scheme makes little sense. As is often true
when the law makes little sense, it is not first principles but
their interpretation and application that have gone awry.
Although I agree with the Court that the case can be resolved by following the three-part inquiry we have identified
to assess restrictions on commercial speech, Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y, 447 U. S.
557, 566 (1980), a preliminary observation is in order.
Speech has the capacity to convey complex substance, yielding various insights and interpretations depending upon the
identity of the listener or the reader and the context of its
transmission. It would oversimplify to say that what we
consider here is commercial speech and nothing more, for in
many instances the banned communications may be vital to
the recipients' right to petition the courts for redress of
grievances. The complex nature of expression is one reason
why even so-called commercial speech has become an essential part of the public discourse the First Amendment secures. See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766-767
(1993). If our commercial speech rules are to control this
case, then, it is imperative to apply them with exacting care

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY, J.,

dissenting

and fidelity to our precedents, for what is at stake is the
suppression of information and knowledge that transcends
the financial self-interests of the speaker.
I
As the Court notes, the first of the CentralHudson factors
to be considered is whether the interest the State pursues
in enacting the speech restriction is a substantial one. Ante,
at 624. The State says two different interests meet this
standard. The first is the interest "in protecting the personal
privacy and tranquility" of the victim and his or her family.
Brief for Petitioner 8. As the Court notes, that interest has
recognition in our decisions as a general matter; but it does
not follow that the privacy interest in the cases the majority
cites is applicable here. The problem the Court confronts,
and cannot overcome, is our recent decision in Shapero v.
Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988). In assessing the
importance of the interest in that solicitation case, we made
an explicit distinction between direct, in-person solicitations
and direct-mail solicitations. Shapero, like this case, involved a direct-mail solicitation, and there the State recited
its fears of "overreaching and undue influence." Id., at 475.
We found, however, no such dangers presented by direct-mail
advertising. We reasoned that "[a] letter, like a printed advertisement (but unlike a lawyer), can readily be put in a
drawer to be considered later, ignored, or discarded." Id.,
at 475-476. We pointed out that "[t]he relevant inquiry is
not whether there exist potential clients whose 'condition'
makes them susceptible to undue influence, but whether the
mode of communication poses a serious danger that lawyers
will exploit any such susceptibility." Id., at 474. In assessing the substantiality of the evils to be prevented, we concluded that "the mode of communication makes all the difference." Id., at 475. The direct mail in Shapero did not
present the justification for regulation of speech presented
in Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (a

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

lawyer's direct, in-person solicitation of personal injury business may be prohibited by the State). See also Edenfield,
supra (an accountant's direct, in-person solicitation of accounting business did implicate a privacy interest, though
not one permitting state suppression of speech when other
factors were considered).
To avoid the controlling effect of Shapero in the case before us, the Court seeks to declare that a different privacy
interest is implicated. As it sees the matter, the substantial
concern is that victims or their families will be offended by
receiving a solicitation during their grief and trauma. But
we do not allow restrictions on speech to be justified on the
ground that the expression might offend the listener. On
the contrary, we have said that these "are classically not justifications validating the suppression of expression protected
by the First Amendment." Carey v. PopulationServices
Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977). And in Zauderer v. Office of
Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S.
626 (1985), where we struck down a ban on attorney advertising, we held that "the mere possibility that some members
of the population might find advertising.., offensive cannot
justify suppressing it. The same must hold true for advertising that some members of the bar might find beneath their
dignity." Id., at 648.
We have applied this principle to direct-mail cases as well
as with respect to general advertising, noting that the right
to use the mails is protected by the First Amendment. See
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 76
(1983) (REHNQUIST, J., concurring) (citing Blount v. Rizzi,

400 U. S. 410 (1971)). In Bolger, we held that a statute designed to "shiel[d] recipients of mail from materials that they
are likely to find offensive" furthered an interest of "little
weight," noting that "we have consistently held that the fact
that protected speech may be offensive to some does not justify its suppression." 463 U. S., at 71 (citing Carey, supra,
at 701). It is only where an audience is captive that we will

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

assure its protection from some offensive speech. See Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y, 447 U. S. 530, 542 (1980). Outside that context, "we
have never held that the Government itself can shut off the
flow of mailings to protect those recipients who might potentially be offended." Bolger, supra, at 72. The occupants of
a household receiving mailings are not a captive audience,
463 U. S., at 72, and the asserted interest in preventing their
offense should be no more controlling here than in our prior
cases. All the recipient of objectional mailings need do is to
take "the 'short, though regular, journey from mail box to
trash can."' Ibid. (citation omitted). As we have observed,
this is "an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is concerned." Ibid. If these cases forbidding restrictions on speech that might be offensive are to be overruled,
the Court should say so.
In the face of these difficulties of logic and precedent, the
State and the opinion of the Court turn to a second interest:
protecting the reputation and dignity of the legal profession.
The argument is, it seems fair to say, that all are demeaned
by the crass behavior of a few. The argument takes a further step in the amicus brief filed by the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America. There it is said that disrespect for the
profession from this sort of solicitation (but presumably from
no other sort of solicitation) results in lower jury verdicts.
In a sense, of course, these arguments are circular. While
disrespect will arise from an unethical or improper practice,
the majority begs a most critical question by assuming that
direct-mail solicitations constitute such a practice. The fact
is, however, that direct solicitation may serve vital purposes
and promote the administration of justice, and to the extent
the bar seeks to protect lawyers' reputations by preventing
them from engaging in speech some deem offensive, the
State is doing nothing more (as amicus the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America is at least candid enough to admit)
than manipulating the public's opinion by suppressing speech

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

that informs us how the legal system works. The disrespect
argument thus proceeds from the very assumption it tries to
prove, which is to say that solicitations within 30 days serve
no legitimate purpose. This, of course, is censorship pure
and simple; and censorship is antithetical to the first principles of free expression.
II

Even were the interests asserted substantial, the regulation here fails the second part of the Central Hudson test,
which requires that the dangers the State seeks to eliminate
be real and that a speech restriction or ban advance that
asserted state interest in a direct and material way. Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771. The burden of demonstrating the
reality of the asserted harm rests on the State. Ibid.
Slight evidence in this regard does not mean there is sufficient evidence to support the claims. Here, what the State
has offered falls well short of demonstrating that the harms
it is trying to redress are real, let alone that the regulation
directly and materially advances the State's interests. The
parties and the Court have used the term "Summary of Record" to describe a document prepared by the Florida Bar
(Bar), one of the adverse parties, and submitted to the District Court in this case. See ante, at 626. This document
includes no actual surveys, few indications of sample size or
selection procedures, no explanations of methodology, and no
discussion of excluded results. There is no description of
the statistical universe or scientific framework that permits
any productive use of the information the so-called Summary
of Record contains. The majority describes this anecdotal
matter as "noteworthy for its breadth and detail," ante, at
627, but when examined, it is noteworthy for its incompetence. The selective synopses of unvalidated studies deal,
for the most part, with television advertising and phone book
listings, and not direct-mail solicitations. Although there
may be issues common to various kinds of attorney advertising- and solicitation, it is not clear what would follow from

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY, J.,

dissenting

that limited premise, unless the Court means by its decision
to call into question all forms of attorney advertising. The
most generous reading of this document permits identification of 34 pages on which direct-mail solicitation is arguably
discussed. Of these, only two are even a synopsis of a study
of the attitudes of Floridians towards such solicitations.
The bulk of the remaining pages include comments by lawyers about direct mail (some of them favorable), excerpts
from citizen complaints about such solicitation, and a few excerpts from newspaper articles on the topic. Our cases require something more than a few pages of self-serving and
unsupported statements by the State to demonstrate that a
regulation directly and materially advances the elimination
of a real harm when the State seeks to suppress truthful and
nondeceptive speech. See, e. g., Edenfield, 507 U. S., at
771-772.
It is telling that the essential thrust of all the material
adduced to justify the State's interest is devoted to the reputational concerns of the Bar. It is not at all clear that this
regulation advances the interest of protecting persons who
are suffering trauma and grief, and we are cited to no material in the record for that claim. Indeed, when asked at oral
argument what a "typical injured plaintiff get[s] in the mail,"
the Bar's lawyer replied: "That's not in the record... and I

don't know the answer to that question." Tr. of Oral Arg.
25. Having declared that the privacy interest is one both
substantial and served by the regulation, the Court ought
not to be excused from justifying its conclusion.
III
The insufficiency of the regulation to advance the State's
interest is reinforced by the third inquiry necessary in this
analysis. Were it appropriate to reach the third part of the
Central Hudson test, it would be clear that the relationship
between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve
them is not a reasonable fit. The Bar's rule creates a flat

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

ban that prohibits far more speech than necessary to serve
the purported state interest. Even assuming that interest
were legitimate, there is a wild disproportion between the
harm supposed and the speech ban enforced. It is a disproportion the Court does not bother to discuss, but our speech
jurisprudence requires that it do so. Central Hudson, 447
U. S., at 569-571; Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y
v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989).
To begin with, the ban applies with respect to all accidental injuries, whatever their gravity. The Court's purported
justification for the excess of regulation in this respect is the
difficulty of drawing lines between severe and less serious
injuries, see ante, at 633, but making such distinctions is not
important in this analysis. Even were it significant, the
Court's assertion is unconvincing. After all, the criminal
law routinely distinguishes degrees of bodily harm, see, e. g.,
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual
§ 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(b), (h), (j) (Nov. 1994), and if that delineation is permissible and workable in the criminal context,
it should not be "hard to imagine the contours of a regulation" that satisfies the reasonable fit requirement. Ante, at
633.
There is, moreover, simply no justification for assuming
that in all or most cases an attorney's advice would be unwelcome or unnecessary when the survivors or the victim must
at once begin assessing their legal and financial position in a
rational manner. With regard to lesser injuries, there is little chance that for any period, much less 30 days, the victims
will become distraught upon hearing from an attorney. It
is, in fact, more likely a real risk that some victims might
think no attorney will be interested enough to help them.
It is at this precise time that sound legal advice may be necessary and most urgent.
Even as to more serious injuries, the State's argument
fails, since it must be conceded that prompt legal representation is essential where death or injury results from accidents.

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

The only seeming justification for the State's restriction is
the one the Court itself offers, which is that attorneys can
and do resort to other ways of communicating important
legal information to potential clients. Quite aside from the
latent protectionism for the established bar that the argument discloses, it fails for the more fundamental reason that
it concedes the necessity for the very representation the attorneys solicit and the State seeks to ban. The accident victims who are prejudiced to vindicate the State's purported
desire for more dignity in the legal profession will be the
very persons who most need legal advice, for they are the
victims who, because they lack education, linguistic ability,
or familiarity with the legal system, are unable to seek out
legal services. Cf. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia.
State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3-4 (1964).
The reasonableness of the State's chosen methods for redressing perceived evils can be evaluated, in part, by a commonsense consideration of other possible means of regulation
that have not been tried. Here, the Court neglects the fact
that this problem is largely self-policing: Potential clients
will not hire lawyers who offend them. And even if a person
enters into a contract with an attorney and later regrets it,
Florida, like some other States, allows clients to rescind certain contracts with attorneys within a stated time after they
are executed. See, e. g., Rules Regulating the Florida Bar,
Rule 4-1.5 (Statement of Client's Rights) (effective Jan. 1,
1993). The State's restriction deprives accident victims of
information which may be critical to their right to make a
claim for compensation for injuries. The telephone book and
general advertisements may serve this purpose in part; but
the direct solicitation ban will fall on those who most need
legal representation: for those with minor injuries, the victims too ill informed to know an attorney may be interested
in their cases; for those with serious injuries, the victims too
ill informed to know that time is of the essence if counsel is
to assemble evidence and warn them not to enter into settle-

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.
KENNEDY,

ment negotiations or evidentiary discussions with investigators for opposing parties. One survey reports that over a
recent 5-year period, 68% of the American population consulted a lawyer. N. Y. Times, June 11, 1995, section 3, p. 1,
col. 1. The use of modern communication methods in a
timely way is essential if clients who make up this vast demand are to be advised and informed of all of their choices
and rights in selecting an attorney. The very fact that some
280,000 direct-mail solicitations are sent to accident victims
and their survivors in Florida each year is some indication
of the efficacy of this device. Nothing in the Court's opinion
demonstrates that these efforts do not serve some beneficial
role. A solicitation letter is not a contract. Nothing in the
record shows that these communications do not at the least
serve the purpose of informing the prospective client that he
or she has a number of different attorneys from whom to
choose, so that the decision to select counsel, after an interview with one or more interested attorneys, can be deliberate and informed. And if these communications reveal the
social costs of the tort system as a whole, then efforts can be
directed to reforming the operation of that system, not to
suppressing information about how the system works. The
Court's approach, however, does not seem to be the proper
way to begin elevating the honor of the profession.
IV
It is most ironic that, for the first time since Bates v. State
Bar of Arizona, the Court now orders a major retreat from
the constitutional guarantees for commercial speech in order
to shield its own profession from public criticism. Obscuring the financial aspect of the legal profession from public
discussion through direct-mail solicitation, at the expense of
the least sophisticated members of society, is not a laudable
constitutional goal. There is no authority for the proposition that the Constitution permits the State to promote the
public image of the legal profession by suppressing informa-

Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
KENNEDY,

J., dissenting

tion about the profession's business aspects. If public respect for the profession erodes because solicitation distorts
the idea of the law as most lawyers see it, it must be remembered that real progress begins with more rational speech,
not less. I agree that if this amounts to mere "sermonizing," see Shapero, 486 U. S., at 490 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), the attempt may be futile. The guiding principle, however, is that full and rational discussion furthers sound
regulation and necessary reform. The image of the profession cannot be enhanced without improving the substance of
its practice. The objective of the profession is to ensure
that "the ethical standards of lawyers are linked to the service and protection of clients." Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 461.
Today's opinion is a serious departure, not only from our
prior decisions involving attorney advertising, but also from
the principles that govern the transmission of commercial
speech. The Court's opinion reflects a new-found and illegitimate confidence that it, along with the Supreme Court
of Florida, knows what is best for the Bar and its clients.
Self-assurance has always been the hallmark of a censor.
That is why under the First Amendment the public, not the
State, has the right and the power to decide what ideas and
information are deserving of their adherence. "[T]he general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented."
Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 767. By validating Florida's rule,
today's majority is complicit in the Bar's censorship. For
these reasons, I dissent from the opinion of the Court and
from its judgment.
