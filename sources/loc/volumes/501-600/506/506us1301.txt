OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

GRUBBS v. DELO, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI
CORRECTIONAL CENTER
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE OF
DEATH

No. A-324.

Decided October 20, 1992

Applicant's request to stay his execution is granted pending further order
by the Circuit Justice or by the full Court. Since there is insufficient
time to consider the application's merits, and with an execution so irrevocable, it is best to err on the applicant's side.

Circuit Justice.
This application for a stay of execution reaches me, as Circuit Justice, at approximately 11 p.m. eastern daylight time
this Tuesday, October 20, 1992. Applicant's execution by
the State of Missouri is scheduled two hours later, at 1 a.m.
e.d.t., Wednesday, October 21. This afternoon, Judge Carol
Jackson of the Eastern District of Missouri granted a stay.
This evening, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit, by a 2-to-1 vote, with Judge Bright
in dissent, vacated the District Court's stay. Then the
Court of Appeals, by a vote of 9 to 1, still later this evening,
denied a suggestion for rehearing en banc, and denied a motion for stay of execution.
The present application thus comes to me with the judges
below apparently divided 9 to 3. The State, before me, relies on its brief filed with the Court of Appeals.
In this situation, there just is not sufficient time for me
adequately to consider the merits of the stay application.
(There is no suggestion of undue delay or procedural unfairness on the part of the applicant.) With an execution so

irrevocable, I therefore choose to err, if at all, on the side of
the applicant. I have granted the stay pending further
order by me as Circuit Justice or by the full Court.
