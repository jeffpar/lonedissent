OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Per Curiam

JUDD v. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 99-5260. Decided October 12, 1999
Hel& Abusive filer of frivolous petitions is denied leave to proceed in
forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.8 and barred from filing further petitions in noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing
fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance with
Rule 33.1. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506
U.S. 1.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Judd seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Judd is allowed until
November 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to
accept any further petitions for certiorari or petitions for
extraordinary writs from Judd in noncriminal matters unless
he first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Judd has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary
writ processes. On May 30, 1995, we invoked Rule 39.8 to
deny Judd in forma pauperis status with respect to a petition for an extraordinary writ. See In re Judd, 515 U. S.
1101. Prior to this Rule 39.8 denial, Judd had filed six petitions for certiorari, all of which were both frivolous and had
been denied without recorded dissent. Since the Rule 39.8
denial, Judd has filed four petitions for certiorari, all of which
were also frivolous and denied without recorded dissent.
The instant petition for certiorari thus brings Judd's total
number of frivolous filings to 12.

JUDD v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR
WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.
STEVENS, J., dissenting

We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Judd's abuse of
the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been
in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly.
The order therefore will not prevent Judd from petitioning
to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on
him. The order will, however, allow this Court to devote
its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have
not abused our processes.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS,
