BRANCATO v. GUNN ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 98-9913.

Decided October 12, 1999

Hel&" Abusive filer of frivolous petitions is denied leave to proceed in
forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.8 and barred from filing
further certiorari petitions in noncriminal matters unless he first pays
the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33.1. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Brancato seeks leave to proceed informa
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Brancato is allowed until
November 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to
accept any further petitions for certiorari from Brancato in
noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee
required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance
with Rule 33.1.
Brancato has abused this Court's certiorari process. On
June 7, 1999, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Brancato in

forma pauperis status with respect to a petition for certiorari. See Brancato v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 526
U. S. 1157. Prior to the Rule 39.8 denial, Brancato had filed
six petitions for certiorari, all of which were both frivolous
and had been denied without recorded dissent. The instant
petition for certiorari thus brings Brancato's total number of
frivolous filings to eight.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Brancato's abuse
of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and
we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will
not prevent Brancato from petitioning to challenge criminal
sanctions which might be imposed on him. The order will,
however, allow this Court to devote its limited resources to
the claims of petitioners who have not abused our processes.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS,
