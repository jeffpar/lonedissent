OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Per Curiam

FLIPPO v. WEST VIRGINIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF WEST VIRGINIA, FAYETTE COUNTY*
No. 98-8770. Decided October 18, 1999
After petitioner was indicted for murdering his wife, he moved to suppress evidence that the police discovered in a closed briefcase during a
warrantless search of the secured crime scene, a cabin where the couple
was vacationing. A West Virginia trial court denied his motion on the
ground that the police were entitled to search any crime scene and the
objects found there. The State Supreme Court of Appeals denied discretionary review.
Held The trial court's position squarely conflicts with this Court's holding in Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 885, that there is no "murder scene
exception" to the Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause. While the police may make warrantless entries onto premises if they reasonably believe a person needs immediate aid and may make prompt warrantless
searches of a homicide scene for possible other victims or a killer, a
search is not constitutionally permissible simply because a homicide has
recently occurred on the premises. Id., at 395. On remand, if properly
raised, matters such as the State's contention that the search was consensual, the applicability of any other exception to the warrant rule, or
the harmlessness vel non of any error in receiving this evidence may
be resolved.
Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner's motion to suppress evidence seized in a
warrantless search of a "homicide crime scene" was denied
on the ground that the police were entitled to make a
thorough search of any crime scene and the objects found
*Petitioner sought a writ directed to the West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals. That court, however, merely declined to exercise discretionary review. The last state court to rule on the merits of this case was
the Circuit Court of West Virginia, Fayette County, to which the writ is
therefore addressed.

there. Because the rule applied directly conflicts with Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978), we reverse.
One night in 1996, petitioner and his wife were vacationing
at a cabin in a state park. After petitioner called 911 to
report that they had been attacked, the police arrived to find
petitioner waiting outside the cabin, with injuries to his head
and legs. After questioning him, an officer entered the
building and found the body of petitioner's wife, with fatal
head wounds. The officers closed off the area, took petitioner to the hospital, and searched the exterior and environs
of the cabin for footprints or signs of forced entry. When a
police photographer arrived at about 5:30 a.m., the officers
reentered the building and proceeded to "process the crime
scene." Brief in Opposition 5. For over 16 hours, they took
photographs, collected evidence, and searched through the
contents of the cabin. According to the trial court, "[a]t the
crime scene, the investigating officers found on a table in
Cabin 13, among other things, a briefcase, which they, in the
ordinary course of investigating a homicide, opened, wherein
they found and seized various photographs and negatives."
Indictment No. 96-F-119 (Cir. Ct. Fayette County, W. Va.,
May 28, 1997), App. A to Pet. for Cert., p. 2.
Petitioner was indicted for the murder of his wife and
moved to suppress the photographs and negatives discovered
in an envelope in the closed briefcase during the search.1
He argued that the police had obtained no warrant, and that
no exception to the warrant requirement justified the search
and seizure.

The photographs included several taken of a man who appears to be
taking off his jeans. He was later identified as Joel Boggess, a friend
of petitioner and a member of the congregation of which petitioner was
the minister. At trial, the prosecution introduced the photographs as evidence of petitioner's relationship with Mr. Boggess and argued that the
victim's displeasure with this relationship was one of the reasons that
petitioner may have been motivated to kill her.

In briefs to the trial court, petitioner contended that
Mincey v. Arizona, supra, rejects a "crime scene exception" to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.
The State also cited Mincey; it argued that the police may
conduct an immediate investigation of a crime scene to preserve evidence from intentional or accidental destruction,
id., at 394, and characterized the police activity in this case
as "crime scene search and inventory," Brief in Opposition 12. The State also relied on the "plain view" exception, Mincey, supra, at 393 (citing Michigan v. Tyler, 436
U. S. 499, 509-510 (1978)), noting only, however, that the
briefcase was unlocked.
In denying the motion, the trial court said nothing about
inventory or plain view, but instead approved the search as
one of a "homicide crime scene":
"The Court also concludes that investigating officers,
having secured, for investigative purposes, the homicide
crime scene, were clearly within the law to conduct a
thorough investigation and examination of anything and
everything found within the crime scene area. The examination of [the] briefcase found on the table near the
body of a homicide victim in this case is clearly something an investigating officer could lawfully examine."
App. A to Pet. for Cert., at 3.
After hearing an oral presentation of petitioner's petition for
appeal of this ruling, and with the full record before it, the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia denied discretionary review. No. 982196 (Jan. 13, 1999), App. B to Pet.
for Cert.
A warrantless search by the police is invalid unless it falls
within one of the narrow and well-delineated exceptions to
the warrant requirement, Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.
347, 357 (1967), none of which the trial court invoked

here.2 It simply found that after the homicide crime scene
was secured for investigation, a search of "anything and
everything found within the crime scene area" was "within
the law." App. A to Pet. for Cert., at 3.
This position squarely conflicts with Mincey v. Arizona,
supra, where we rejected the contention that there is a
"murder scene exception" to the Warrant Clause of the
Fourth Amendment. We noted that police may make warrantless entries onto premises if they reasonably believe a
person is in need of immediate aid and may make prompt
warrantless searches of a homicide scene for possible other
victims or a killer on the premises, id., at 392, but we rejected any general "murder scene exception" as "inconsistent with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments-... the
warrantless search of Mincey's apartment was not constitutionally permissible simply because a homicide had recently occurred there." Id., at 395; see also Thompson v.
Louisiana, 469 U. S. 17, 21 (1984) (per curiam). Mincey
controls here.
Although the trial court made no attempt to distinguish
Mincey, the State contends that the trial court's ruling is
supportable on the theory that petitioner's direction of the
police to the scene of the attack implied consent to search as
2

The State suggests that the trial court's finding that the search was
"within the law" could be read as premised on the theories of plain
view, exigent circumstances, and inventory that the State advanced below.
No trace of this reasoning appears in the trial court's opinion, which instead appears to undermine the State's interpretation. It seems implausible that the court found that there was a risk of intentional or accidental
destruction of evidence at a "secured" crime scene or that the authorities
were performing a mere inventory search when the premises had been
secured for "investigative purposes" and the officers opened the briefcase
"in the ordinary course of investigating a homicide." Nor does the court's
validation of "investiga[ting] and examin[ing] ... anything and everything
found within the crime scene area," including photographs inside a closed
briefcase, apparently rest on the plain-view exception. App. A to Pet. for
Cert., at 2, 3.

they did. As in Thompson v. Louisiana,supra,at 23, however, we express no opinion on whether the search here
might be justified as consensual, as "the issue of consent is
ordinarily a factual issue unsuitable for our consideration in
the first instance." Nor, of course, do we take any position
on the applicability of any other exception to the warrant
rule, or the harmlessness vel non of any error in receiving
this evidence. Any such matters, properly raised, may be
resolved on remand. 469 U. S., at 21; see also United States
v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164 (1974).
The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted, the judgment
of the Circuit Court of West Virginia, Fayette County, is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
