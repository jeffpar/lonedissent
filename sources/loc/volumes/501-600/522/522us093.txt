HUDSON ET AL. v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-976. Argued October 8, 1997-Decided December 10, 1997
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) imposed monetary
penalties and occupational debarment on petitioners for violating 12
U. S. C. §§ 84(a)(1) and 375b by causing two banks in which they were
officials to make certain loans in a manner that unlawfully allowed petitioner Hudson to receive the loans' benefit. When the Government
later criminally indicted petitioners for essentially the same conduct,
they moved to dismiss under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth
Amendment. The District Court ultimately dismissed the indictments,
but the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on United States v. Halper,
490 U. S. 435, 448-449.
Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause is not a bar to petitioners' later criminal prosecution because the OCC administrative proceedings were civil,
not criminal. Pp. 98-105.
(a) The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. See, e. g., Helvering v. Mitchell,
303 U. S.391,399. Halperdeviated from this Court's longstanding double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects. First, it bypassed the traditional threshold question whether the legislature intended the particular
successive punishment to be "civil" or "criminal" in nature, see, e. g.,
United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248, focusing instead on whether
the sanction was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as to
constitute "Punishment." The Court thereby elevated to dispositive
status one of the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372
U. S.144, 168-169, for determining whether a statute intended to be
civil was so punitive as to transform it into a criminal penalty, even
though Kennedy itself emphasized that no one factor should be considered controlling, id., at 169. Second, Halper "assess[ed] the character
of the actual sanctions imposed," 490 U. S., at 447, rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the "statute on its face" to determine
whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S.,
at 169. Such deviations were ill considered. Halper's test has proved
unworkable, creating confusion by attempting to distinguish between
"Punitive" and "nonpunitive" penalties. Moreover, some of the ills at
which it was directed are addressed by other constitutional provisions.

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
Thus, this Court largely disavows Halper'smethod of analysis and reaffirms the previous rule exemplified in Ward. Pp. 98-103.
(b) Applying traditional principles to the facts, it is clear that petitioners' criminal prosecution would not violate double jeopardy. The
money penalties statutes' express designation of their sanctions as
"civil," see §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), and the fact that the authority to issue
debarment orders is conferred upon the "appropriate Federal banking
agenc[ies]," see §§ 1818(e)(1)-(3), establish that Congress intended these
sanctions to be civil in nature. Moreover, there is little evidencemuch less the "clearest proof" this Court requires, see Ward, supra, at
249-to suggest that the sanctions were so punitive in form and effect
as to render them criminal despite Congress' contrary intent, see United
States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 290. Neither sanction has historically
been viewed as punishment, Helvering, supra, at 399, and n. 2, 400, and
neither involves an affirmative disability or restraint, see Flemming v.
Nestor, 863 U. S. 603, 617. Neither comes into play "only" on a finding
of scienter, Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 168, since penalties may be assessed
under §§ 93(b) and 504, and debarment imposed under § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii),
without regard to the violator's willfulness. That the conduct for which
0CC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal, see ibid., is insufficient
to render the sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, supra, at 292, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509
U. S. 688, 704. Finally, although the imposition of both sanctions will
deter others from emulating petitioners' conduct, see Kennedy, supra,
at 168, the mere presence of this traditional goal of criminal punishment
is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "may serve
civil as well as criminal goals," e. g., Ursery,supra,at 292. Pp. 103-105.

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a bar
to the later criminal prosecution because the administrative
proceedings were civil, not criminal. Our reasons for so
holding in large part disavow the method of analysis used in
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), and reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980).
During the early and mid-1980's, petitioner John Hudson
was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the First
National Bank of Tipton (Tipton) and the First National
Bank of Hammon (Hammon).1 During the same period,
petitioner Jack Rackley was president of Tipton and a member of the board of directors of Hammon, and petitioner
Larry Baresel was a member of the board of directors of
both Tipton and Hammon.
An examination of Tipton and Hammon led the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to conclude that petitioners had used their bank positions to arrange a series
of loans to third parties in violation of various federal banking statutes and regulations. According to the OCC, those
loans, while nominally made to third parties, were in reality
made to Hudson in order to enable him to redeem bank stock
that he had pledged as collateral on defaulted loans.
On February 13, 1989, OCC issued a "Notice of Assessment
of Civil Money Penalty." The notice alleged that petitioners
had violated 12 U. S. C. §§ 84(a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12
CFR §§ 31.2(b) and 215.4(b) (1986) by causing the banks with
which they were associated to make loans to nominee borrowers in a manner that unlawfully allowed Hudson to receive the benefit of the loans. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a.
The notice also alleged that the illegal loans resulted in
losses to Tipton and Hammon of almost $900,000 and contributed to the failure of those banks. Id., at 97a. However,
the notice contained no allegation of any harm to the Govern1Tipton

Opinion of the Court

ment as a result of petitioners' conduct. "After taking into
account the size of the financial resources and the good faith
of [petitioners], the gravity of the violations, the history of
previous violations and other matters as justice may require,
as required by 12 U. S. C. §§ 93(b)(2) and 504(b)," OCC assessed penalties of $100,000 against Hudson and $50,000 each
against Rackley and Baresel. Id., at 89a. On August 31,
1989, 0CC also issued a "Notice of Intention to Prohibit Further Participation" against each petitioner. Id., at 99a.
These notices, which were premised on the identical allegations that formed the basis for the previous notices, informed
petitioners that OCC intended to bar them from further participation in the conduct of "any insured depository institution." Id., at 100a.
In October 1989, petitioners resolved the OCC proceedings
against them by each entering into a "Stipulation and Consent Order." These consent orders provided that Hudson,
Baresel, and Rackley would pay assessments of $16,500,
$15,000, and $12,500 respectively. Id., at 130a, 140a, 135a.
In addition, each petitioner agreed not to "participate in any
manner" in the affairs of any banking institution without the
written authorization of the 0CC and all other relevant regulatory agencies. 2 Id., at 131a, 141a, 136a.
In August 1992, petitioners were indicted in the Western
District of Oklahoma in a 22-count indictment on charges of
conspiracy, 18 U. S. C. §371, misapplication of bank funds,
§§ 656 and 2, and making false bank entries, § 1005. 3 The
violations charged in the indictment rested on the same lend2

The consent orders also contained language providing that they did
not constitute "a waiver of any right, power, or authority of any other
representatives of the United States, or agencies thereof, to bring other
actions deemed appropriate." App. to Pet. for Cert. 133a, 143a, 138a.
The Court of Appeals ultimately held that this provision was not a waiver
of petitioners' double jeopardy claim. 14 F. 3d 536, 539 (CA10 1994).
3Only petitioner Rackley was indicted for making false bank entries in
violation of 18 U. S. C. §1005.

Opinion of the Court

ing transactions that formed the basis for the prior administrative actions brought by OCC. Petitioners moved to
dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, but the
District Court denied the motions. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court's holding on the nonparticipation
sanction issue, but vacated and remanded to the District
Court on the money sanction issue. 14 F. 3d 536 (CA10
1994). The District Court on remand granted petitioners'
motion to dismiss the indictments. This time the Government appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. 92 F.
3d 1026 (1996). That court held, following Halper,that the
actual fines imposed by the Government were not so grossly
disproportional to the proved damages to the Government
as to render the sanctions "punishment" for double jeopardy
purposes. We granted certiorari, 520 U. S. 1165 (1997), because of concerns about the wide variety of novel double
jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of Halper.4 We now
affirm, but for different reasons.
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no "person
[shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb." We have long recognized that the
Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of
4

E. g., Zukas v. Hinson, 1997 WL 623648 (CAll, Oct. 21, 1997) (challenge to FAA revocation of a commercial pilot's license as violative of
double jeopardy); E. B. v. Verniero, 119 F. 3d 1077 (CA3 1997) (challenge
to "Megan's Law" as violative of double jeopardy); Jones v. Securities &
Exchange Comm'n, 115 F. 3d 1173 (CA4 1997) (challenge to SEC debarment proceeding as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Rice,
109 F. 3d 151 (CA3 1997) (challenge to criminal drug prosecution following

criminal fraud prosecution as foreclosed by previous debarment from Government contracting); Taylor v. Cisneros, 102 F. 3d 1334 (CA3 1996) (challenge to eviction from federally subsidized housing based on guilty plea to
possession of drug paraphernalia as violative of double jeopardy); United
States v. Galan, 82 F. 3d 639 (CA5) (challenge to prosecution for prison
escape following prison disciplinary proceeding as violative of double jeopardy), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 867 (1996).

Opinion of the Court

all additional sanctions that could, "'in common parlance,"'
be described as punishment. United States ex rel. Marcus
v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 549 (1943) (quoting Moore v. Illinois,
14 How. 13, 19 (1852)). The Clause protects only against the
imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same
offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938); see
also Hess, supra, at 548-549 ("Only" "criminal punishment"
"subject[s] the defendant to 'jeopardy' within the constitutional meaning"); Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 528 (1975)
("In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk that
is traditionally associated with a criminal prosecution"), and
then only when such occurs in successive proceedings, see
Missouri v. Hunter,459 U. S. 359, 366 (1983).
Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at
least initially, a matter of statutory construction. Helvering, supra,at 399. A court must first ask whether the legislature, "in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated
either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or
the other." Ward, 448 U. S., at 248. Even in those cases
where the legislature "has indicated an intention to establish
a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect," id.,
at 248-249, as to "transfor[m] what was clearly intended as
a civil remedy into a criminal penalty," Rex Trailer Co. v.
United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).
In making this latter determination, the factors listed in
Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963),
provide useful guideposts, including: (1) "[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint"; (2)
"whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment";
(3) "whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter";
(4) "whether its operation will promote the traditional aims
of punishment-retribution and deterrence"; (5) "whether
the behavior to which it applies is already a crime"; (6)
"whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally
be connected is assignable for it"; and (7) "whether it appears

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned."
It is important to note, however, that "these factors must be
considered in relation to the statute on its face," id., at 169,
and "only the clearest proof" will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil
remedy into a criminal penalty, Ward, supra, at 249 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
Our opinion in United States v. Halper marked the first
time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction
without first determining that it was criminal in nature. In
that case, Irwin Halper was convicted of, inter alia,violating
the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. §287, based on
his submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of which
overcharged the Government by $9. He was sentenced to
two years' imprisonment and fined $5,000. The Government
then brought an action against Halper under the civil False
Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. §§ 3729-3731 (1982 ed., Supp. II).
The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act provided
that a violation of the Act rendered one "liable to the United
States Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amount
equal to 2 times the amount of damages the Government
sustains because of the act of that person, and costs of the
civil action." Id., §3729. Given Halper's 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of
$130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600. However, the District Court concluded that a penalty of this magnitude would violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause in light of Halper's previous criminal conviction. While explicitly recognizing that the statutory damages provision of the Act "was not itself a criminal
punishment," the District Court nonetheless concluded that
application of the full penalty to Halper would constitute a
second "punishment" in violation of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. 490 U. S., at 438-439.
On direct appeal, this Court affirmed. As the Halper
Court saw it, the imposition of "punishment" of any kind was

Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

subject to double jeopardy constraints, and whether a
sanction constituted "punishment" depended primarily on
whether it served the traditional "goals of punishment,"
namely, "retribution and deterrence." Id., at 448. Any
sanction that was so "overwhelmingly disproportionate" to
the injury caused that it could not "fairly be said solely to
serve [the] remedial purpose" of compensating the Government for its loss, was thought to be explainable only as "serving either retributive or deterrent purposes." See id., at
448-449 (emphasis added).
The analysis applied by the Halper Court deviated from
our traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects.
First, the Halper Court bypassed the threshold question:
whether the successive punishment at issue is a "criminal"
punishment. Instead, it focused on whether the sanction,
regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grossly
disproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute "punishment." In so doing, the Court elevated a single Kennedy
factor-whether the sanction appeared excessive in relation
to its nonpunitive purposes-to dispositive status. But as
we emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should be
considered controlling as they "may often point in differing
directions." 372 U. S., at 169. The second significant departure in Halper was the Court's decision to "asses[s] the
character of the actual sanctions imposed," 490 U. S., at 447,
rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the "statute
on its face" to determine whether it provided for what
amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169.
We believe that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered. 5 As subsequent
r In his concurrence, JusTIcE STEVENS criticizes us for reexamining our
Halper opinion rather than deciding the case on what he believes is the
narrower Blockburgergrounds. But the question upon which we granted
certiorari in this case is "whether imposition upon petitioners of monetary
fines as in personam civil penalties by the Department of the Treasury,
together with other sanctions, is 'punishment' for purposes of the Double

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

cases have demonstrated, Halper's test for determining
whether a particular sanction is "punitive," and thus subject
to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved
unworkable. We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994);
United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).6
If a sanction must be "solely" remedial (i. e., entirely nondeterrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause,
then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.
Under Halper's method of analysis, a court must also look at
the "sanction actually imposed" to determine whether the
Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated. Thus, it will not be
possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause
is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to
judgment. But in those cases where the civil proceeding
follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the
face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids
the government from even "attempting a second time to
punish criminally." Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasis
added).
Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at which
Halper was directed are addressed by other constitutional
Jeopardy Clause." Pet. for Cert. i. It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.
Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did not
even pass upon the Blockburger question, finding it unnecessary to do so.
92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3.
6 In Kurth Ranch, we held that the presence of a deterrent purpose or
effect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question. 511 U. S., at 781.
Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test, see 511 U. S., at 780-783, before
concluding that Montana's dangerous drug tax was "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution," id., at 784. Similarly, in
Ursery, we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause. 518 U. S., at 270-271. We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures
are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy. Id., at 292.

Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

provisions. The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses
already protect individuals from sanctions which are downright irrational. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,
348 U. S. 483 (1955). The Eighth Amendment protects
against excessive civil fines, including forfeitures. Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544 (1993); Austin v. United
States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993). The additional protection afforded by extending double jeopardy protections to proceedings heretofore thought to be civil is more than offset by
the confusion created by attempting to distinguish between
"punitive" and "nonpunitive" penalties.
Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the
facts of this case, it is clear that the criminal prosecution of
these petitioners would not violate the Double Jeopardy
Clause. It is evident that Congress intended the 0CC
money penalties and debarment sanctions imposed for violations of 12 U. S. C. § 84 and 375b to be civil in nature. As
for the money penalties, both §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), which
authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violations
of H 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that such
penalties are "civil." While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating the
sanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority to
issue debarment orders is conferred upon the "appropriate
Federal banking agenc[ies]." H 1818(e)(1)-(3). That such
authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is
prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for
a civil sanction. See Helvering,supra, at 402; United States
v. Spector, 343 U. S.169, 178 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting)
("Administrative determinations of liability to deportation
have been sustained as constitutional only by considering
them to be'exclusively civil in nature, with no criminal consequences or connotations"); Wong Wing v. United States, 163
U. S. 228, 235 (1896) (holding that quintessential criminal
punishments may be imposed only "by a judicial trial").

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Turning to the second stage of the Ward test, we find that
there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we
require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are "so punitive in form and effect as to
render them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary." Ursery, supra, at 290. First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment. We have long recognized that "revocation of
a privilege voluntarily granted," such as a debarment, "is
characteristically free of the punitive criminal element."
Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399, and n. 2. Similarly, "the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which
ha[s] been recognized as enforcible by civil proceedings since
the original revenue law of 1789." Id., at 400.
Second, the sanctions imposed do not involve an "affirmative disability or restraint," as that term is normally understood. While petitioners have been prohibited from further
participating in the banking industry, this is "certainly nothing approaching the 'infamous punishment' of imprisonment." Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).
Third, neither sanction comes into play "only" on a finding of
scienter. The provisions under which the money penalties
were imposed, 12 U. S. C. §§ 93(b) and 504, allow for the assessment of a penalty against any person "who violates" any
of the underlying banking statutes, without regard to the
violator's state of mind. "Good faith" is considered by OCC
in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed,
§ 93(b)(2), but a penalty can be imposed even in the absence
of bad faith. The fact that petitioners' "good faith" was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look onlyto "the statute on its face" to determine whether a penalty is criminal
in nature. Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169. Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a "willful' disregard "for the
safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,"

Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient
that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was "continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).
Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed
may also be criminal (and in this case formed the basis for
petitioners' indictments). This fact is insufficient to render
the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292, particularly in the double
jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688,
704 (1993) (rejecting "same-conduct" test for double jeopardy purposes).
Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money
penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from
emulating petitioners' conduct, a traditional goal of criminal
punishment. But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "may
serve civil as well as criminal goals." Ursery, supra, at
292; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996)
("[F]orfeiture... serves a deterrent purpose distinct from
any punitive purpose"). For example, the sanctions at issue
here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve
to promote the stability of the banking industry. To hold
that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such
sanctions "criminal" for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government's ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions such as banks.
In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothing
of the "clearest proof" required by Ward, that OCC money
penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal. The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to their trial on
the pending indictments, and it may proceed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit is accordingly
Affirmed.

I wholly agree with the Court's conclusion that Halper's
test for whether a sanction is "punitive" was ill considered
and unworkable. Ante, at 101-102. Indeed, it was the absurdity of trying to force the Halper analysis upon the Montana tax scheme at issue in Departmentof Revenue of Mont.
v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), that prompted me to
focus on the prior question whether the Double Jeopardy
Clause even contains a multiple-punishments prong. See
id., at 802-803. That evaluation led me to the conclusion
that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment, and that we should therefore "put the Halper genie back in the bottle." Id., at 803805. Today's opinion uses a somewhat different bottle than
I would, returning the law to its state immediately prior to
Halper-which acknowledged a constitutional prohibition of
multiple punishments but required successive criminal
prosecutions. So long as that requirement is maintained,
our multiple-punishments jurisprudence essentially duplicates what I believe to be the correct double jeopardy law,
and will be as harmless in the future as it was pre-Halper.
Accordingly, I am pleased to concur.

The maxim that "hard cases make bad law" may also apply
to easy cases. As I shall explain, this case could easily
be decided by the straightforward application of wellestablished precedent. Neither such a disposition, nor anything in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, would require
a reexamination of the central holding in United States v.
Halper,490 U. S. 435 (1989), or of the language used in that
unanimous opinion. Any proper concern about the danger
that that opinion might be interpreted too expansively would
be more appropriately addressed in a case that was either
incorrectly decided or that at least raised a close or difficult

question. In my judgment it is most unwise to use this case
as a vehicle for the substitution of a rather open-ended attempt to define the concept of punishment for the portions
of the opinion in Halper that trouble the Court. Accordingly, while I have no hesitation about concurring in the
Court's judgment, I do not join its opinion.
I
As is evident from the first sentence of the Court's opinion,
this is an extremely easy case. It has been settled since the
decision in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932),
that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated simply
because a criminal charge involves "essentially the same conduct" for which a defendant has previously been punished.
See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696, 704
(1993); Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S. 292, 297 (1996).
Unless a second proceeding involves the "same offense" as
the first, there is no double jeopardy. The two proceedings
at issue here involved different offenses that were not even
arguably the same under Blockburger.
Under Blockburger's "same-elements" test, two provisions
are not the "same offense" if each contains an element not
included in the other. Dixon, 509 U. S., at 696. The penalties imposed on the petitioners in 1989 were based on violations of 12 U. S. C. §§ 84(a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12 CFR
§§31.2(b) and 215.4(b) (1986). Each of these provisions required proof that extensions of credit exceeding certain limits were made,' but did not require proof of an intent to defraud or the making of any false entries in bank records.
The 1992 indictment charged violations of 18 U. S. C. §§ 371,
656, and 1005 and alleged a conspiracy to willfully misapply
'Title 12 U. S. C. §84(a)(1) prohibits total loans and extensions of credit
by a national banking association to any one borrower from exceeding 15
percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. Title 12 U. S. C.
§375b and 12 CFR §§31.2(b) and 215A(b) (1986) impose similar lending
limits on loans to bank officers and other insiders.

bank funds and to make false banking entries, as well as the
making of such entries; none of those charges required proof
that any lending limit had been exceeded.
Thus, I think it would be difficult to find a case raising a
double jeopardy
claim that would be any easier to decide
2
than this one.

II

The Court not only ignores the most obvious and straightforward basis for affirming the judgment of the Court of
Appeals; it also has nothing to say about that court's explanation of why the reasoning in our opinion in United States v.
Halper supported a rejection of petitioners' double jeopardy
claim. Instead of granting certiorari to consider a possible
error in the Court of Appeals' reasoning or its judgment,
the Court candidly acknowledges that it was motivated by
"concerns about the wide variety of novel double jeopardy
claims spawned in the wake of Halper." Ante, at 98.
The Court's opinion seriously exaggerates the significance
of those concerns. Its list of cases illustrating the problem
cites seven cases decided in the last two years. Ante, at 98,
n. 4. In every one of those cases, however, the Court of
Appeals rejected the double jeopardy claim. The only ruling
by any court favorable to any of these "novel" claims was
a preliminary injunction entered by a District Court postponing implementation of New Jersey's novel, controversial
2

Petitioners challenge this conclusion by relying on dicta from Kansas
v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 370 (1997). There, after rejecting a double
jeopardy challenge to Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, the Court
added: "The Blockburger test, however, simply does not apply outside of
the successive prosecution context." Ibid. This statement, pure dictum,
was unsupported by any authority and contradicts the earlier ruling in
United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704-705 (1993), that the Blockburger
analysis applies to claims of successive punishment as well as successive
prosecution. See also 509 U. S., at 745-746 (SouTER, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part) (explaining why the Blockburger
test applies in the multiple punishments context). I cannot imagine a
good reason why Blockburger should not apply here.

"Megan's Law." E. B. v. Poritz, 914 F. Supp. 85 (NJ 1996),
rev'd, E. B. v. Verniero, 119 F. 3d 1077 (CA3 1997). Thus,
the cases cited by the Court surely do not indicate any need
to revisit Halper.
The Court also claims that two practical flaws in the
Halper opinion warrant a prompt adjustment in our double
jeopardy jurisprudence. First, the Court asserts that Halper's test is unworkable because it permits only successive
sanctions that are "solely" remedial. Ante, at 102. Though
portions of Halperwere consistent with such a reading, the
express statement of its holding was much narrower.3 Of
greater importance, the Court has since clarified this very
point:
"Whether a particular sanction 'cannot fairly be said
solely to serve a remedial purpose' is an inquiry radically different from that we have traditionally employed
in order to determine whether, as a categorical matter,
a civil sanction is subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Yet nowhere in Halperdoes the Court purport to make
such a sweeping change in the law, instead emphasizing
repeatedly the narrow scope of its decision." United
States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 285, n. 2 (1996).
Having just recently emphasized Halper's narrow rule in
Ursery, it is quite odd for the Court now to suggest that its
overbreadth has created some sort of judicial emergency.
Second, the Court expresses the concern that when a civil
proceeding follows a criminal punishment, Halper would require a court to wait until judgment is imposed in the successive proceeding before deciding whether the latter sanction
violates double jeopardy. Ante, at 102. That concern is
3 ,"We... hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who

already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected
to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may
not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution." United States v. Halper,490 U. S. 435, 448-449 (1989).

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

wholly absent in this case, however, because the criminal indictment followed administrative sanctions. There can be
no doubt that any fine or sentence imposed on the criminal
counts would be "punishment." If the indictment charged
the same offense for which punishment had already been imposed, the prosecution itself would be barred by the Double
Jeopardy Clause no matter how minor the criminal sanction
sought in the second proceeding.
Thus, the concerns that the Court identifies merely emphasize the accuracy of the comment in Halper itself that it announced "a rule for the rare case ...

where a fixed-penalty

provision subjects a prolific but small-gauge offender to a
sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he
has caused." 490 U. S., at 449.
III
Despite my disagreement with the Court's decision to use
this case as a rather lame excuse for writing a gratuitous
essay about punishment, I do agree with its reaffirmation of
the central holding of Halperand Department of Revenue of
Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994). Both of those
cases held that sanctions imposed in civil proceedings consti-4
tuted "punishment" barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Those holdings reconfirmed the settled proposition that the
Government cannot use the "civil" label to escape entirely
the Double Jeopardy Clause's command, as we have recognized for at least six decades. See United States v. La
Franca,282 U. S.568, 574-575 (1931); Helvering v. Mitchell,
303 U. S. 391, 398-399 (1938). That proposition is extremely
4 Other recent double jeopardy decisions have also recognized that dou-

ble jeopardy protection is not limited to multiple prosecutions. See
United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S.267, 273 (1996); Kansas v. Hendricks,
521 U. S., at 369. Otherwise, it would have been totally unnecessary to
determine whether the civil forfeitures in Ursery and the involuntary civil
commitment in Hendricks imposed "punishment" for double jeopardy purposes, for neither sanction was implemented via criminal proceedings.

STEVENrS, J., concurring in judgment

important because the States and the Federal Government
have an enormous array of civil administrative sanctions at
their disposal that are capable of being used to punish persons repeatedly for the same offense, violating the bedrock
double jeopardy principle of finality. "The underlying idea,
one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American
system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated
attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,
thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity ....

"

Green v. United States, 355 U. S.

184, 187 (1957). However the Court chooses to recalibrate
the meaning of punishment for double jeopardy purposes, our
doctrine still limits multiple sanctions of the rare sort contemplated by Halper.
IV
Today, as it did in Halper itself, the Court relies on the
sort of multifactor approach to the definition of punishment
that we used in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144,
168-169 (1963), to identify situations in which a civil sanction
is punitive. Whether the Court's reformulation of Halper's
test will actually affect the outcome of any cases remains to
be seen. Perhaps it will not, since the Court recommends
consideration of whether a sanction's "'operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment-retribution and
deterrence,"' and "'whether it appears excessive in relation
to the alternative [nonpunitive] purpose assigned."' Ante,
at 99-100 (quoting Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 168-169). Those
factors look awfully similar to the reasoning in Halper, and
while we are told that they are never by themselves dispositive, ante, at 101, they should be capable of tipping the balance in extreme cases. The danger in changing approaches
midstream, rather than refining our established approach on
an incremental basis, is that the Government and lower

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
SOUTER, J.,

concurring in judgment

courts may be unduly influenced by the Court's new attitude,
rather than its specific prescribed test.
It is, of course, entirely appropriate for the Court to perform a lawmaking function as a necessary incident to its Article III responsibility for the decision of "Cases" and "Controversies." In my judgment, however, a desire to reshape
the law does not provide a legitimate basis for issuing what
amounts to little more than an advisory opinion that, at best,
will have the precedential value of pure dictum and may in
time unduly restrict the protections of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions
of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a
decision of the case." Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283,
295 (1905); see also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345848 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Accordingly, while I
concur in the judgment of affirmance, I do not join the
Court's opinion.
JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring in the judgment.

I concur in the Court's judgment and with much of its opinion. As the Court notes, ante, at 102, we have already recognized that Halper's statements of standards for identifying what is criminally punitive under the Fifth Amendment
needed revision, United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284285, n. 2 (1996), and there is obvious sense in employing common criteria to point up the criminal nature of a statute for
purposes of both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See
United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms,465 U. S.
354, 362-366 (1984); United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242,
248-249 (1980); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,372 U. S. 144,
168-169 (1963); see also Ward, supra, at 254 ("[I]t would be
quite anomalous to hold that [the statute] created a criminal
penalty for the purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause but
a civil penalty for all other purposes").
Applying the Court's Kennedy-Ward criteria leads me directly to the conclusion of JUSTICE STEVENS'S opinion con-

Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)
SOUTER, J.,

concurring injudgment

curring in the judgment. The fifth criterion calls for a court
to determine whether "the behavior to which [the penalty]
applies is already a crime." Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,
supra, at 168-169. The efficient starting point for identifying constitutionally relevant "behavior," when considering
an objection to a successive prosecution, is simply to apply
the same-elements test as originally stated in Blockburger
v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932). See United States v.
Dixon, 509 U. S. 688 (1993). When- application of Blockburger under Kennedy-Ward shows that a successive prosecution is permissible even on the assumption that each penalty is criminal, the issue is necessarily settled. Such is the
case here, as JUSTICE STEVENS explains. See ante, at 107
(opinion concurring in judgment). Applying the KennedyWard criteria, therefore, I would stop just where JUSTICE
STEVENS

stops.

My acceptance of the Kennedy-Ward analytical scheme is
subject to caveats, however. As the Court points out, under
Ward, once it is understood that a legislature intended a penalty to be treated as civil in character, that penalty may be
held criminal for Fifth Amendment purposes (and, for like
reasons, under the Sixth Amendment) only on the "clearest
proof" of its essentially criminal proportions. While there
are good and historically grounded reasons for using that
phrase to impose a substantial burden on anyone claiming
that an apparently civil penalty is in truth criminal, what
may be clear enough to be "clearest" is necessarily dependent on context, as indicated by the cases relied on as authority for adopting the standard in Ward. Flemming v. Nestor,
363 U. S.603 (1960), used the quoted language to describe
the burden of persuasion necessary to demonstrate a criminal and punitive purpose unsupported by "objective manifestations" of legislative intent. Id., at 617. Rex Trailer Co.
v. United States, 350 U. S.148, 154 (1956), cited as secondary
authority, required a defendant to show that a "measure of
recovery" was "unreasonable or excessive" before "what was

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES

SOUTER, J., concurring injudgment

clearly intended as a civil remedy [would be treated as] a
criminal penalty." One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United
States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972) (per curiam), cited Rex
Trailerfor that standard and relied on the case as exemplifying a provision for liquidated damages as distinct from criminal penalty. I read the requisite "clearest proof" of criminal
character, then, to be a function of the strength of the countervailing indications of civil nature (including the presumption of constitutionality enjoyed by an ostensibly civil statute
making no provision for the safeguards guaranteed to criminal defendants. See Flemming,supra, at 617).
I add the further caution, to be wary of reading the "clearest proof" requirement as a guarantee that such a demonstration is likely to be as rare in the future as it has been in
the past. See United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.435, 449
(1989) ("What we announce now is a rule for the rare case").
We have noted elsewhere the expanding use of ostensibly
civil forfeitures and penalties under the exigencies of the current drug problems, see Ursery, supra, at 300 (STEVENS, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("In
recent years, both Congress and the state legislatures have
armed their law enforcement authorities with new powers to
forfeit property that vastly exceed their traditional tools");
United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,510 U. S.
43, 81-82 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), a development doubtless spurred by the increasingly inviting prospect of its profit to the Government. See
id., at 56, n. 2 (opinion of the Court) (describing the Government's financial stake in drug forfeiture); see also id., at 56
(citing Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.957, 979, n. 9 (1991)
(opinion of SCALIA, J.) for the proposition that "it makes
sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when
the State stands to benefit"). Hence, on the infrequency of
"clearest proof," history may not be repetitive.

BREYER, J., concurring in judgment
JUSTICE BREYER,

with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,

concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the majority and with JUSTICE SOUTER that

United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal
and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings. I also agree
that United States v. Ward, 448 U. S.242, 248 (1980), and
Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963),
set forth the proper approach.
I do not join the Court's opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects. First, unlike the
Court I would not say that "'only the clearest proof"' will
"transform" into a criminal punishment what a legislature
calls a "civil remedy." Ante, at 100. I understand that the
Court has taken this language from earlier cases. See
Ward, supra, at 249. But the limitation that the language
suggests is not consistent with what the Court has actually
done. Rather, in fact if not in theory, the Court has simply
applied factors of the Kennedy variety to the matter at hand.
In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511
U. S.767 (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of
drugs was "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal
prosecution" because, among other things, the tax was "remarkably high"; it had "an obvious deterrent purpose"; it
was "conditioned on the commission of a crime"; it was "exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the
precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation"; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well
served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and
it departed radically from "normal revenue laws" by taxing
contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed. Id., at 781-784. This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in Kennedy, and it is, I
believe, the proper approach. The "clearest proof" language

HUDSON v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J.,

concurring in judgment

is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the
same legal limbo where Halper now rests.
Second, I would not decide now that a court should evaluate a statute only "'on its face,"' ante, at 100 (quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169), rather than "assessing the character of
the actual sanctions imposed," Halper, supra, at 447; ante,
at 101. Halper involved an ordinary civil-fine statute that
as normally applied would not have created any "double
jeopardy" problem. It was not the statute itself, but rather
the disproportionate relation between fine and conduct as
the statute was applied in the individual case that led this
Court, unanimously, to find that the "civil penalty" was, in
those circumstances, a second "punishment" that constituted
double jeopardy.

See 490 U. S., at 439, 452 (finding that

$130,000 penalty was "sufficiently disproportionate" to $585
loss plus approximately $16,000 in Government expenses
caused by Halper's fraud to constitute a second punishment
in violation of double jeopardy). Of course, the Court in
Halpermight have reached the same result through application of the constitutional prohibition of "excessive fines."
See ante, at 103; Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544,
558-559 (1993); Halper, supra, at 449 (emphasizing that
Halper was "the rare case" in which there was an "overwhelmingly disproportionate" fine). But that is not what
the Court there said. And nothing in the majority's opinion
today explains why we should abandon this aspect of Halper's holding. Indeed, in context, the language of Kennedy
that suggests that the Court should consider the statute on
its face does not suggest that there may not be further analysis of a penalty as it is applied in a particular case. See 372
U. S., at 169. Most of the lower court confusion and criticism of Halper appears to have focused on the problem of
characterizing-by examining the face of the statute-the
purposes of a civil penalty as punishment, not on the application of double jeopardy analysis to the penalties that are imposed in particular cases. It seems to me quite possible that

Cite as: 522 U. S. 93 (1997)

117

BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

a statute that provides for a punishment that normally is
civil in nature could nonetheless amount to a criminal punishment as applied in special circumstances. And I would not
now hold to the contrary.
That said, an analysis of the Kennedy factors still leads me
to the conclusion that the statutory penalty in this case is
not on its face a criminal penalty. Nor, in my view, does the
application of the statute to the petitioners in this case
amount to criminal punishment. I therefore concur in the
judgment.
