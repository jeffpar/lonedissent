RIVET ET AL. v. REGIONS BANK OF
LOUISIANA ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-1971.

Argued January 21, 1998-Decided February 24, 1998

After a partnership mortgaged its interest in the Louisiana equivalent of
a leasehold estate to respondent Regions Bank of Louisiana (Bank), the
partnership granted a second mortgage to petitioners, and later filed for
bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court approved a sale of the leasehold
estate to the Bank. Thereafter, the Bank acquired the underlying land
and sold the entire property to respondent Fountainbleau Storage Associates (FSA). Petitioners then fled this action in Louisiana state court,
alleging that transfer of the property without satisfying their rights
under the second mortgage violated state law. Respondents removed
the action to federal court, contending that federal-question jurisdiction
existed because the prior Bankruptcy Court orders extinguished petitioners' rights. The District Court denied petitioners' motion to remand, concluding from the Fifth Circuit's decision in Carpenterv. Wichita Falls Independent School Dist., 44 F. 3d 362, that removal was
properly predicated on the preclusive effect of the Bankruptcy Court
orders. The court then granted summary judgment to, inter alios, the
Bank and FSA. In affirming, the Fifth Circuit agreed that under Carpenter removal is proper where a plaintiff's state cause of action is completely precluded by a prior federal judgment on a federal question.
The court thought Carpenter'sholding was dictated by the second footnote in Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394,
397, n. 2.
Held: Claim preclusion by reason of a prior federal judgment is a defensive plea that provides no basis for removal. Such a defense is properly
made in the state proceedings, and the state courts' disposition of it is
subject to this Court's ultimate review. Pp. 474-478.
(a) Respondents invoked, in support of removal, the district courts'
original federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1441(b). The
presence or absence of such jurisdiction is governed by the "Wellpleaded complaint rule," under which "federal jurisdiction exists only
when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint." CaterpillarInc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386,

392. Because a defense is not part of a plaintiff's properly pleaded
statement of his or her claim, see, e. g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 63, removal of a case to federal court may not be
predicated on the presence of a federal defense, Franchise Tax Bd. of
Cal. v. ConstructionLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463
U. S. 1, 14. As a corollary to the well-pleaded defense rule, "a plaintiff
may not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal questions." Id., at 22. If the plaintiff thus "artfully pleads" a claim, a court
may uphold removal even though no federal question appears on the
face of the complaint. The artful pleading doctrine allows removal
where federal law completely preempts an asserted state-law claim, see
MetropolitanLife Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 65-66, for a claim of that preempted character is, from its inception, a claim that can arise only under
federal, not state, law. Caterpillar,482 U. S., at 393. Pp. 474-476.
(b) Removal was improper here. Claim preclusion, as Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure Rule 8(c) makes clear, is an affirmative defense. A
case blocked by the preclusive effect of a prior federal judgment differs
from a case preempted by a federal statute: The prior federal judgment
does not transform the plaintiff's state-law claims into federal claims
but rather extinguishes them altogether. Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, preclusion thus remains a defensive plea involving no recasting of the plaintiff's complaint, and is therefore not a proper basis for
removal. The Court's marginal comment in Moitie noted that the
Court declined, in that case-specific context, to "question ...[the District Court's] factual finding" that the plaintiffs "had attempted to avoid
removal jurisdiction by artfully casting their essentially federal[-]law
claims as state-law claims." 452 U. S., at 397, n. 2 (internal quotation
marks omitted). While the footnote placed Moitie in the "artful pleading" category, it created no preclusion exception to the rule, fundamental under currently governing legislation, that a defendant cannot remove on the basis of a federal defense. Pp. 476-478.
108 F. 3d 576, reversed and remanded.
GiNSBURG, 3., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

With him on the briefs were Stuart E.Des Roches and Linda
V Farrer.

RIVET v. REGIONS BANK OF LA.
Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
Congress has provided for removal of cases from state
court to federal court when the plaintiff's complaint alleges
a claim arising under federal law. Congress has not authorized removal based on a defense or anticipated defense federal in character. This case presents the question whether
removal may be predicated on a defendant's assertion that a
prior federal judgment has disposed of the entire matter and
thus bars plaintiffs from later pursuing a state-law-based
case. We reaffirm that removal is improper in such a case.
In so holding we clarify and confine to its specific context the
Court's second footnote in Federated Department Stores,
Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394, 397, n. 2 (1981). The defense
of claim preclusion, we emphasize, is properly made in the
state proceeding, subject to this Court's ultimate review.
JUSTICE GINSBURG

I
This case arose out of a series of mortgages and conveyances involving a parcel of real property in New Orleans.
In 1983, a partnership that owned the Louisiana equivalent
of a leasehold estate in the property mortgaged that interest
to respondent Regions Bank of Louisiana (Bank).' One year
later, to secure further borrowing, the partnership granted
a second mortgage to petitioners Mary Anna Rivet, Minna
Ree Winer, Edmond G. Miranne, and Edmond G. Miranne,
Jr. The partnership thereafter filed for bankruptcy, and the
bankruptcy trustee sought court permission to sell the leasehold estate free and clear of all claims.
In June and August 1986 orders, the Bankruptcy Court
first granted the sale application and later approved sale of
the leasehold estate to the Bank, sole bidder at the public
auction. The court also directed the Recorder of Mortgages
IThe events leading to this lawsuit actually involved two predecessors
of Regions, First Federal Bank and Secor Bank. For ease of discussion,
we use the name Regions Bank to cover all three entities.

Opinion of the Court

for Orleans Parish to cancel all liens, mortgages, and encumbrances, including the mortgages held by the Bank and
petitioners. Nonetheless, petitioners' mortgage remained
inscribed on the mortgage rolls of Orleans Parish. Subsequently, in 1993, the Bank acquired the underlying land from
respondents Walter L. Brown, Jr., and Perry S. Brown. The
Bank then sold the entire property to the current owner,
respondent Fountainbleau Storage Associates (ESA).
On December 29, 1994, petitioners filed this action in Louisiana state court. They alleged that the 1993 transactions
violated Louisiana law because the property was transferred
without satisfying petitioners' superior rights under the second mortgage. In their prayer for relief, petitioners sought
recognition and enforcement of their mortgage or, alternatively, damages. Respondents removed the action to
the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
Federal-question jurisdiction existed, they contended, because the prior Bankruptcy Court orders extinguished petitioners' rights under the second mortgage.
In federal court, petitioners ified a motion to remand and
respondents moved for summary judgment. The District
Court denied the remand motion. Relying on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Carpenter v. Wichita Falls Independent
School Dist., 44 F. 3d 362 (1995), the District Court held that
removal was properly predicated on the preclusive effect of
the 1986 Bankruptcy Court orders. The court then granted
summary judgment to the Bank and FSA on the ground that
the Bankruptcy Court's adjudication barred petitioners' suit.
The District Court also granted summary judgment to the
Browns, ruling that petitioners failed to state a claim
against them.
The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 108 F. 3d 576 (1997). It
agreed with the District Court that under Carpenter a defendant could remove "'where a plaintiff ifies a state cause
of action completely precluded by a prior federal judgment
on a question of federal law."' 108 F. 3d, at 586 (quoting

RIVET v. REGIONS BANK OF LA.

Opinion of the Court

Carpenter,44 F. 3d, at 370). Carpenter'sholding, the Court
of Appeals thought, was dictated by the second footnote to'
our decision in Moitie, 452 U. S., at 397, n. 2.
In dissent, Judge Jones maintained that removal is appropriate under Moitie only where a plaintiff loses in federal
court on an "essentially federal" claim and, recharacterizing
the claim as one based on state law, files again in state court.
108 F. 3d, at 594. She concluded that removal here was improper because there was nothing federal about petitioners'
claim.
The Courts of Appeals have adopted differing views regarding the propriety of removing a state-court action to
federal court on the ground that the claim asserted is precluded by a prior federal judgment. 2 We granted certiorari,
521 U. S. 1152 (1997), to resolve the matter.

A
A state-court action may be removed to federal court if it
qualifies as a "civil action ... of which the district courts of

the United States have original jurisdiction," unless Congress expressly provides otherwise. 28 U. S. C. ยง 1441(a).
In this case, respondents invoked, in support of removal, the
district courts' original federal-question jurisdiction over
"[a]ny civil action .

law), with Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Sarkisian, 794 F. 2d 754, 759-761
(CA2 1986) (removal under Moitie permitted only where the elements of
a plaintiff's state-law claim are virtually identical to the elements of a

Opinion of the Court

under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United
States." 28 U. S. C. ยง 1441(b); see also 28 U. S. C. ยง 1331.
We have long held that "[t]he presence or absence of
federal-question jurisdiction is governed by the 'well-pleaded
complaint rule,' which provides that federal jurisdiction
exists only when a federal question is presented on the face
of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint." Caterpillar
Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S.386, 392 (1987); see also Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S.149, 152 (1908).
A defense is not part of a plaintiff's properly pleaded statement of his or her claim. See MetropolitanLife Ins. Co. v.
Taylor, 481 U. S.58, 63 (1987); Gully v. FirstNat. Bank in
Meridian,299 U. S.109, 112 (1936) ("To bring a case within
the [federal-question removal] statute, a right or immunity
created by the Constitution or laws of the United States
must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's
cause of action."). Thus, "a case may not be removed to
federal court on the basis of a federal defense, . . . even if
the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff's complaint, and
even if both parties admit that the defense is the only question truly at issue in the case." Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.
v. ConstructionLaborers Vacation Trustfor Southern Cal.,
463 U. S.1, 14 (1983).
Allied as an "independent corollary" to the well-pleaded
complaint rule is the further principle that "a plaintiff may
not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal
questions." Id., at 22. If a court concludes that a plaintiff
has "artfully pleaded" claims in this fashion, it may uphold
removal even though no federal question appears on the face
of the plaintiff's complaint. The artful pleading doctrine
allows removal where federal law completely preempts a
plaintiff's state-law claim. See MetropolitanLife Ins. Co.,
481 U. S., at 65-66 (upholding removal based on the preemptive effect of ยง 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974); Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390
U. S. 557, 560 (1968) (upholding removal based on the pre-

Opinion of the Court

emptive effect of ยง301 of the Labor Management Relations
Act, 1947). Although federal preemption is ordinarily a defense, "[o]nce an area of state law has been completely preempted, any claim purportedly based on that pre-empted
state-law claim is considered, from its inception, a federal
claim, and therefore arises under federal law." Caterpillar,
482 U. S., at 393..
B
Petitioners' complaint sought recognition and enforcement
of a mortgage. The dispute involved Louisiana parties only,
and petitioners relied exclusively on Louisiana law. Respondents defended their removal of the case from state
court to federal court on the ground that petitioners' action
was precluded, as a matter of federal law, by the earlier
Bankruptcy Court orders. We now explain why the removal was improper.
Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, "[a] final judgment
on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been
raised in that action." Moitie, 452 U. S., at 398; see also
Baker v. General Motors Corp., ante, at 233, n. 5 ("a valid
final adjudication of a claim precludes a second action on that
claim or any part of it"). Claim preclusion (res judicata), as
Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear, is an affirmative defense. See also Blonder-Tongue
Laboratories,Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation,402 U. S.
313, 350 (1971) ("Res judicata and collateral estoppel [issue
preclusion] are affirmative defenses that must be pleaded."
(italics omitted)).
A case blocked by the claim preclusive effect of a prior
federal judgment differs from the standard case governed by
a completely preemptive federal statute in this critical respect: The prior federal judgment does not transform the
plaintiff's state-law claims into federal claims but rather extinguishes them altogether. See Commissioner v. Sunnen,

Cite as: 522 U. S. 470 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

333 U. S. 591, 597 (1948) ("The judgment puts an end to the
cause of action, which cannot again be brought into litigation
between the parties upon any ground whatever, absent fraud
or some other factor invalidating the judgment."). Under
the well-pleaded complaint rule, preclusion thus remains a
defensive plea involving no recasting of the plaintiff's complaint, and is therefore not a proper basis for removal.
In holding removal appropriate here, the Court of Appeals
relied on a footnote-the second one-in our Moitie opinion.
The Fifth Circuit is not alone in concluding from the Moitie
footnote that removal properly may rest on the alleged preclusive effect of a prior federal judgment. See supra, at
474, n. 2. The Moitie footnote, however, was a marginal
comment and will not bear the heavy weight lower courts
have placed on it.
We granted certiorari in Moitie principally to address the
Ninth Circuit's "novel exception to the doctrine of res judicata." 452 U. S., at 398. In that case, several actions alleging price fixing by department stores in California were
consolidated in federal court and dismissed. Most of the
plaintiffs appealed and obtained a reversal, but two chose
instead to fie separate claims in state court. The defendants removed the actions to Federal District Court, where
plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved to remand and defendants
successfully moved to dismiss the actions on preclusion
grounds. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed
that removal was proper, but held that preclusion did not
apply in the unique circumstances of the case. Moitie v.
FederatedDepartment Stores, Inc., 611 F. 2d 1267 (1980).
In the course of reversing the Ninth Circuit's holding on
preclusion, we noted, without elaboration, our agreement
with the Court of Appeals that "at least some of the claims
had a sufficient federal character to support removal." 452
U. S., at 397, n. 2. In that case-specific context, we declined
to "question . . . [the District Court's] factual finding" that

RIVET v. REGIONS BANK OF LA.

Opinion of the Court

the plaintiffs "had attempted to avoid removal jurisdiction
by artfully casting their essentially federal[-]law claims as
state-law claims." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
"Moitie's enigmatic footnote," Rivet, 108 F. 3d, at 584, we
recognize, has caused considerable confusion in the circuit
courts. We therefore clarify today that Moitie did not create a preclusion exception to the rule, fundamental under
currently governing legislation, that a defendant cannot remove on the basis of a federal defense.
In sum, claim preclusion by reason of a prior federal judgment is a defensive plea that provides no basis for removal
under ยง 1441(b). Such a defense is properly made in the
state proceedings, and the state courts' disposition of it is
subject to this Court's ultimate review.3
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.

We note also that under the relitigation exception to the Anti-

Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. ยง2283, a federal court may enjoin state-court
proceedings "where necessary . . . to protect or effectuate its judgments." Ibid.
