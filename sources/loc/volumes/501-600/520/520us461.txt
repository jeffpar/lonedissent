JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-203. Argued February 25, 1997-Decided May 12, 1997
Petitioner Johnson testified before a federal grand jury, investigating,
inter alia,the disposition of proceeds from her boyfriend's alleged drug
trafficking, that she had obtained tens of thousands of dollars to improve
her home from a box of cash given her late mother by one Talcott.
Subsequently, she was charged with violating 18 U. S. C. § 1623, which
proscribes "knowingly mak[ing] any false material declaration" under
oath before a grand jmy . At her trial, it was revealed that her boyfriend had negotiated the purchase of her home and had an interest in
a corporation whose checks had been used to help pay for the property,
and that Talcott had died several years before the time he allegedly
gave her mother the money. Johnson did not object when, in accordance with then-extant Circuit precedent, the judge instructed the jury
that materiality was a question for him to decide, and that he had determined that her statements were material. Johnson was convicted of
perjury, but before her appeal, this Court ruled, in United States v.
Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, that the materiality of a false statement must be
decided by a jury rather than a trial judge. On appeal, Johnson's claim
that her conviction was invalid under Gaudinwas reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b),
which allows plain errors affecting substantial rights to be noticed even
though no objection has been made. Following the analysis outlined in
United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, the court assumed, arguendo, that
the District Court's failure to submit materiality to the jury constituted
"error" that was "clear or obvious." However, it concluded that any
such error did not affect "substantial rights" because its independent
review of the record showed that there was "overwhelming" evidence
of materiality and that no reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson's
false statements about the money's source were not material to the
grand jury's investigation.
Held: The trial court's action in this case was not "plain error" of the sort
which an appellate court may notice under Rule 52(b).
(a) Since § 1623's text leaves no doubt that materiality is an element
of perjury, Gaudin dictates that materiality in this case be decided by
the jury, not the court. Johnson's failure to timely assert that right
before the trial court ordinarily would result in forfeiture of the right

Syllabus
pursuant to Rule 30. However, Rule 52(b) mitigates Rule 30 and, contrary to Johnson's argument, governs her direct appeal. The Olano
test for applying Rule 52(b) requires that there be (1) error, (2) that is
plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If these three conditions
are met, an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Pp. 465-466.
(b) The first prong of Olano is satisfied here, as Gaudin must be applied to Johnson's case on direct review. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479
U. S. 314, 328. The second prong is met as well. In a case such as
this-where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary
to the law at the time of appeal-it is sufficient that the error be plain
at the time of appellate consideration. Even assuming that the third
prong is also satisfied, a court must still determine whether the forfeited
error meets the fourth prong before it may exercise its discretion to
correct the error. In this case the fourth question must be answered
in the negative. Materiality was essentially uncontroverted at trial and
has remained so on appeal. Johnson has presented no plausible argument that her false statement under oath-lying about the source of
the money she used to improve her home-was somehow not material to the grand jury investigation. It would be the reversal of her
conviction, not the failure to notice the error, that would seriously
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Pp. 466-470.
82 F. 3d 429, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the

Court.*
In this case the trial court itself decided the issue of materiality in a perjury prosecution, rather than submitting it
to the jury as our decision in United States v. Gaudin, 515
U. S. 506 (1995), now requires. No objection was made by
the petitioner, Joyce B. Johnson, and we hold that the court's
action in this case was not "plain error" of the sort which an
appellate court may notice under Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 52(b).
In the late 1980's, a federal investigation into the cocaine
and marijuana trafficking of Earl James Fields revealed that
he and his partner had amassed some $10 million from their
illicit activities. Following the money trail, federal authorities subpoenaed Johnson, Fields' long-time girlfriend, to testify before a federal grand jury. Johnson, who is the mother
of a child by Fields, earned about $34,000 a year at the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. She
testified before the grand jury that she owned five pieces of
real property, including her house. That house was purchased by Johnson in 1991 for $75,600, and in the next two
years she added sufficient improvements to it that in 1993
it was appraised at $344,800. When asked the source of her
home improvement funds, Johnson stated that she had put
$80,000 to $120,000 into her house, all of which had come
from a box of cash given her late mother by one Gerald Talcott in 1985 or 1986.
On the basis of this testimony, Johnson was indicted for
perjury under 18 U. S. C. § 1623. At trial, it was revealed
that Fields had negotiated the original purchase of Johnson's
home and that Johnson had paid for the property with eight
different cashier's checks, including two from a corporation
in which Fields had an interest. It was also established that
Gerald Talcott had died in April 1982, several years before

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

the time Johnson claimed he had given her mother the box
full of cash.
At the close of Johnson's trial, and in accordance with
then-extant Circuit precedent, see, e. g., United States v.
Molinares,700 F. 2d 647, 653 (CAll 1983), the District Judge
instructed the jury that the element of materiality was a
question for the judge to decide, and that he had determined
that her statements were material. App. 72. Johnson did
not object to this instruction. Indeed, when the prosecution
had presented evidence concerning materiality during the
trial, she had then objected, on the ground that materiality
was a matter for the judge, and not the jury, to decide. Id.,
at 61. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Johnson
was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, three years' supervised release, and a $30,000 fine.
After Johnson was convicted, but before her appeal to the
Court of Appeals, we decided United States v. Gaudin,
supra, which held that the materiality of a false statement
must be submitted to the jury rather than decided by the
trial judge. On her appeal, Johnson argued that the trial
judge's failure to submit materiality to the jury rendered her
conviction invalid under Gaudin.
Because Johnson had failed to object to the trial judge's
deciding materiality, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit reviewed for plain error. Rule 52(b) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:
Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not
brought to the attention of the court."
"PLAIN ERROR.

Following our analysis in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S.
725 (1993), the Court of Appeals assumed, arguendo, that
the District Court's failure to submit materiality to the jury
constituted "error" that was "clear or obvious," but concluded nonetheless that any such error did not affect the
"substantial rights" of the defendant. That conclusion was

Cite as: 520 U. S. 461 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

based on the court's independent review of the record and
determination that there was "overwhelming" evidence of
materiality and that "[n]o reasonable juror could conclude
that Johnson's false statements about the source of the
money... were not material to the grand jury's investigation." App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a (judgt. order reported at
82 F. 3d 429 (CAll 1996)). Due to the conflict between this
decision and the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision in United
States v. Keys, 95 F. 3d 874 (1996), we granted certiorari.
519 U. S. 989 (1996). We now affirm.
I
Title 18 U. S. C. § 1623 proscribes "knowingly mak[ing] any
false material declaration" under oath before a grand jury.
Although we merely assumed in Gaudin that materiality is
an element of making a false statement under 18 U. S. C.
§ 1001, and although we recently held that materiality is not
an element of making a false statement to a federally insured
bank under 18 U. S. C. § 1014, United States v. Wells, 519
U. S. 482 (1997), there is no doubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § 1623. The statutory text expressly
requires that the false declaration be "material." Gaudin
therefore dictates that materiality be decided by the jury,
not the court.
Petitioner, however, did not object to the trial court's
treatment of materiality. Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides: "No party may assign as error
any portion of the [jury] charge or omission therefrom unless
that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider
its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party
objects and the grounds of the objection." This Rule is simply the embodiment of the "familiar" principle that a right
"'may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the
failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal
having jurisdiction to determine it."' Olano, supra, at 731
(quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944)).

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

The Rule is mitigated, however, by Rule 52(b), which allows
plain errors affecting substantial rights to be noticed even
though there was no objection.
Petitioner argues that she need not fall within the "limited" and "circumscribed" strictures of Olano, because the
error she complains of here is "structural," and so is outside
Rule 52(b) altogether. But the seriousness of the error
claimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. None of the
cases discussing "structural error," upon which petitioner relies, were direct appeals from judgments of conviction in the
federal system. Several came from state courts which had
considered the claimed error under their own rules. See
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.335 (1963); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508
U. S.275 (1993). Others came here by way of federal habeas
challenges to state convictions. See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474
U. S.254 (1986); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S.168 (1984).
None of them were subject to the provisions of Rule 52.
But it is that Rule which by its terms governs direct ap-

peals from judgments of conviction in the federal system,
and therefore governs this case. We cautioned against any
unwarranted expansion of Rule 52(b) in United States v.
Young, 470 U. S.1 (1985), because it "would skew the Rule's
'careful balancing of our need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around
against our insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed,"' id., at 15 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456
U. S.152, 163 (1982)). Even less appropriate than an unwarranted expansion of the Rule would be the creation out of
whole cloth of an exception to it, an exception which we have
no authority to make. See Carlisle v. United States, 517
U. S.416, 425-426 (1996).
II

We therefore turn to apply here Rule 52(b) as outlined in
Olano. Under that test, before an appellate court can cor-

Cite as: 520 U. S. 461 (1997)

Opinion of the Court

rect an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) "error,"
(2) that is "plain," and (3) that "affect[s] substantial rights."
507 U. S., at 732. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error "' "seriously affect[s] the
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings."'" Ibid. (quoting United States v. Young, supra, at
15, in turn quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157,
160 (1936)).
A
There is no doubt that if petitioner's trial occurred today,
the failure to submit materiality to the jury would be error
under Gaudin. Under Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314
(1987), a "new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions
is to be applied retroactively to all cases . . . pending on
direct review.... with no exception for cases in which the
new rule constitutes a 'clear break' with the past." Id., at
328. Because petitioner is still on direct review, Griffith
requires that we apply Gaudin retroactively. Accordingly,
under Gaudin there was "error," and the first prong of
Olano is satisfied.
B
The second prong is more difficult. Olano explained that
the word "plain" is "synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently,
'obvious."' 507 U. S., at 734. But Olano refrained from deciding when an error must be plain to be reviewable. "At a
minimum," 0lano concluded, the error must be plain "under
current law." Ibid. In the case with which we are faced
today, the error is certainly clear under "current law," but it
was by no means clear at the time of trial.
The Government contends that for an error to be "plain,"
it must have been so both at the time of trial and at the time
of appellate consideration. In this case, it says, petitioner
should have objected to the court's deciding the issue of materiality, even though near-uniform precedent both from this

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Court and from the Courts of Appeals held that course
proper.' Petitioner, on the other hand, urges that such a
rule would result in counsel's inevitably making a long and
virtually useless laundry list of objections to rulings that
were plainly supported by existing precedent. We agree
with petitioner on this point, and hold that in a case such as
this-where the law at the time of trial was settled and
clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal-it is enough
that an error be "plain" at the time of appellate consideration. Here, at the time of trial it was settled that the issue
of materiality was to be decided by the court, not the jury;
by the time of appellate consideration, the law had changed,
and it is now settled that materiality is an issue for the jury.
The second part of the Olano test is therefore satisfied.
C
But even though the error be "plain," it must also "affec[t]
substantial rights." It is at this point that petitioner's argument that the failure to submit an element of the offense to
the jury is "structural error" becomes relevant. She contends in effect that if an error is so serious as to defy
harmless-error analysis, it must also "affec[t] substantial
rights." A "structural" error, we explained in Arizona v.
Fulminante, is a "defect affecting the framework within
which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the
trial process itself," 499 U. S., at 310. We have found structural errors only in a very limited class of cases: See Gideon

v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (a total deprivation of the
right to counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack
of an impartial trial judge); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254
(1986) (unlawful exclusion of grand jurors of defendant's
race); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984) (the right
to self-representation at trial); Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S.
39 (1984) (the right to a public trial); Sullivan v. Louisiana,
508 U. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction
to jury).
It is by no means clear that the error here fits within this
limited class of cases. Sullivan v. Louisiana,the case most
closely on point, held that the erroneous definition of "reasonable doubt" vitiated all of the jury's findings because one
could only speculate what a properly charged jury might
have done. Id., at 280. The failure to submit materiality
to the jury, as in this case, can just as easily be analogized
to improperly instructing the jury on an element of the offense, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Carella v.
California,491 U. S. 263 (1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986),
an error which is subject to harmless-error analysis, as it can
be to failing to give a proper reasonable-doubt instruction
altogether. Cf. California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2, 5 (1996)
(per curiam) ("The specific error at issue here-an error in
the instruction that defined the crime-is ... as easily characterized as a 'misdescription of an element' of the crime, as
it is characterized as an error of 'omission'").
D
But we need not decide that question because, even assuming that the failure to submit materiality to the jury "affec[ted] substantial rights," it does not meet the final requirement of Olano. When the first three parts of Olano
are satisfied, an appellate court must then determine
whether the forfeited error "'seriously affect[s] the fairness,
integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings"' before

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

it may exercise its discretion to correct the error. Olano,
507 U. S., at 736 (quoting Atkinson, 297 U. S., at 160).
In this case that question must be answered in the negative. As the Court of Appeals noted, the evidence supporting materiality was "overwhelming." App. to Pet. for Cert.
9a. Materiality was essentially uncontroverted at trial 2 and
has remained so on appeal. The grand jury here was investigating petitioner's long-time boyfriend's alleged cocaine
and marijuana trafficking and the "disposition of money
which was proceeds of this cocaine and [marijuana] distribution activity, including the possible concealment of such
proceeds as investments in real estate." App. 5-6. Before
the Eleventh Circuit and in her briefing before this Court,
petitioner has presented no plausible argument that the false
statement under oath for which she was convicted-lying
about the source of the tens of thousands of dollars she used
to improve her home-was somehow not material to the
grand jury investigation.
On this record there is no basis for concluding that the
error "seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public
reputation of judicial proceedings." Indeed, it would be the
reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that
effect. "Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the
judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process
and bestirs the public to ridicule it." R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970). No "miscarriage of justice"
will result here if we do not notice the error, Olano, supra,
at 736, and we decline to do so. The judgment of the Court
of Appeals is therefore
Affirmed.
2The Government represents-and petitioner has not disputed-that
the sum total of petitioner's argument at trial concerning materiality consisted of the following conclusory sentence: "'I would argue that the element of materiality has been insufficiently proven and that the Court
ought to grant a judgment of acquittal."' Brief for United States 5 (quoting trial transcript); see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 5.
