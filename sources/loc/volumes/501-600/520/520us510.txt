INTER-MODAL RAIL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION
ET AL. v. ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE
RAILWAY CO., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-491.

Argued March 17, 1997-Decided May 12, 1997

As employees of respondent Santa Fe Terminal Services, Inc. (SFTS), a
wholly owned subsidiary of respondent The Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Co. (ATSF), the individual petitioners were entitled, among
other things, to pension, health, and welfare benefits under SFTSTeamsters Union collective bargaining agreements. The resulting benefit plans were subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA). Ultimately ATSF bid the work being done by
petitioners to respondent In-Terminal Services (ITS) and terminated
SFTS employees who declined to continue employment with ITS. The
ITS-Teamsters pension and welfare benefit plans were less generous
than the SFTS-Teamsters plans. Petitioners filed suit, alleging that
the terminations violated §510 of ERISA, which makes it unlawful to
"discharge ... a [plan] participant ... for the purpose of interfering
with the attainmentof any right to which such participant may become
entitled under the plan." (Emphasis added.) The District Court
granted respondents' motion to dismiss. Concluding that §510 only
prohibits interference with the attainment of rights that are capable of
"vesting," the Court of Appeals reinstated petitioners' claim for interference with pension benefits, but affirmed the dismissal of their claim
for interference with welfare benefits, which do not vest.
Held. The Court of Appeals' holding that §510 bars interference only with
vested rights is contradicted by § 510's plain language, whose use of the
word "plan" all but forecloses that position. ERISA defines "plan" to
include an "employee welfare benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. § 1002(3), even
though welfare plans are exempted from its stringent vesting requirements, see § 1051(1). Had Congress intended to confine § 510's protection to "vested" rights, it could have easily substituted "pension plan"
for "plan" or "nonforfeitable right" for "any right." The flexibility an
employer enjoys to unilaterally amend or eliminate its welfare benefit
plan, see Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 78, does
not justify a departure from §510's plain language. Such flexibility
helps employers avoid the complicated administration and increased cost
of vested plans, and encourages them to offer more generous benefits at
the outset, since they can reduce benefits should economic conditions

Opinion of the Court
sour. Section 510 counterbalances this flexibility by requiring employers to follow a plan's formal amendment process, thus ensuring that
employers do not "circumvent the provision of promised benefits."
Ingersoll-RandCo. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 143. Any tension that
might exist between an employer's amendment power and a participants § 510 rights is the product of a careful balance of competing interests, not the type of "absurd or glaringly unjust" result, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
519 U. S. 248, 261, that would warrant departure from §510's plain language. On remand, the Court of Appeals should have the first opportunity to evaluate respondents' remaining arguments, including their argument that petitioners were eligible to receive welfare benefits under
the SFTS-Teamsters plan at the time they were discharged and, thus,
cannot state a §510 claim. Pp. 514-517.

Opinion of the Court

"discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate
against a participant or beneficiary [of an employee benefit
plan] for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of
any right to which such participant may become entitled
under the plan." 29 U. S. C. § 1140. The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit held that § 510 only prohibits interference with the attainment of rights that are capable of "vesting," as that term is defined in ERISA. We disagree.
I
The individual petitioners are former employees of respondent Santa Fe Terminal Services, Inc. (SFTS), a wholly
owned subsidiary of respondent The Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Co. (ATSF), which was responsible for
transferring cargo between railcars and trucks at ATSF's
Hobart Yard in Los Angeles, California. While petitioners
were employed by SFTS, they were entitled to retirement
benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, 88 Stat.
1312, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 231 et seq., and to pension,
health, and welfare benefits under collective bargaining
agreements involving SFTS and the Teamsters Union.
SFTS provided its workers with pension, health, and welfare
benefits through employee benefit plans subject to ERISA's
comprehensive regulations.
In January 1990, ATSF entered into a formal "Service
Agreement" with SFTS to have SFTS do the same "intermodal" work it had done at the Hobart Yard for the previous
15 years without a contract. Seven weeks later, ATSF exercised its right to terminate the newly formed agreement and
opened up the Hobart Yard work for competitive bidding.
Respondent In-Terminal Services (ITS) was the successful
bidder, and SFTS employees who declined to continue employment with ITS were terminated. ITS, unlike SFTS,
was not obligated to make contributions to the Railroad Retirement Account under the Railroad Retirement Act. ITS
also provided fewer pension and welfare benefits under its

Cite as: 520 U. S. 510 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters Union
than had SFTS. Workers who continued their employment
with ITS "lost their Railroad Retirement Act benefits" and
"suffered a substantial reduction in Teamsters benefits." 80
F. 3d 348, 350 (CA9 1996) (percuriam).
Petitioners sued respondents SFTS, ATSF, and ITS in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that respondents had violated §510 of
ERISA by "discharg[ing]" petitioners "for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of ... right[s] to which" they
would have "become entitled" under the ERISA pension and
welfare plans adopted pursuant to the SFTS-Teamsters collective bargaining agreement. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
29a, Complaint 33. Had SFTS remained their employer,
petitioners contended, they would have been entitled to assert claims for benefits under the SFTS-Teamsters benefit
plans, at least until the collective bargaining agreement that
gave rise to those plans expired. The substitution of ITS
for SFTS, however, precluded them from asserting those
claims and relegated them to asserting claims under the less
generous ITS-Teamsters benefit plans. According to petitioners, the substitution "interfer[ed] with the attainment"
of their "right" to assert those claims and violated §510.
Respondents moved to dismiss these § 510 claims, and the
District Court granted the motion.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in
part and reversed in part. 80 F. 3d 348 (1996). The court
reinstated petitioners' claim under §510 for interference
with their pension benefits, concluding that § 510 "'protects
plan participants from termination motivated by an employer's desire to prevent a pension from vesting."' Id., at 350351 (quoting Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133,
143 (1990)). But the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' claim for interference with their welfare benefits. "Unlike pension benefits," the Court of Appeals observed, "welfare benefits do not vest." 80 F. 3d, at

514

ATCHISON, T. & S. F. R. CO.
Opinion of the Court

351. As a result, the Court of Appeals noted, "employers
remain free to unilaterally amend or eliminate [welfare]
plans," and "employees have no present 'right' to future, anticipated welfare benefits."' Ibid. (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Because the "existence of a
present 'right' is [a] prerequisite to section 510 relief," the
Court of Appeals concluded that §510 did not state a cause
of action for interference with welfare benefits. Ibid. We
granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of
Appeals on this issue,* 519 U. S. 1003 (1996), and now vacate
the decision below and remand.
II
The Court of Appeals' holding that § 510 bars interference
only with vested rights is contradicted by the plain language
of § 510. As noted above, that section makes it unlawful to
"discharge ... a [plan] participant or beneficiary ...for the
purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to
which such participant may become entitled under the plan."
29 U. S. C. § 1140 (emphasis added). ERISA defines a "plan"
to include both "an employee welfare benefit plan [and] an
employee pension benefit plan," § 1002(3), and specifically
exempts "employee welfare benefit plan[s]" from its stringent vesting requirements, see § 1051(1). Because a "plan"
includes an "employee welfare benefit plan," and because
welfare plans offer benefits that do not "vest" (at least insofar as ERISA is concerned), Congress' use of the word "plan"
in § 510 all but forecloses the argument that § 510's interfer*See Shahid v. Ford Motor Co., 76 F. 3d 1404, 1411 (CA6 1996) (holding
that §510 draws no distinction between benefits that vest and those that
do not); Heath v. Varity Corp., 71 F. 3d 256, 258 (CA7 1995) (same); Seaman v. Arvida Realty Sales, 985 F. 2d 543, 546 (CAll) (same), cert. denied,
510 U. S. 916 (1993); see also McGann v. H & H Music Co., 946 F. 2d 401,

Opinion of the Court

ence clause applies only to "vested" rights. Had Congress
intended to confine § 510's protection to "vested" rights, it
could have easily substituted the term "pension plan," see 29
U. S. C. § 1002(2), for "plan," or the term "nonforfeitable"
right, see § 1002(19), for "any right." But § 510 draws no
distinction between those rights that "vest" under ERISA
and those that do not.
The right that an employer or plan sponsor may enjoy in
some circumstances to unilaterally amend or eliminate its
welfare benefit plan does not, as the Court of Appeals apparently thought, justify a departure from § 510's plain language.
It is true that ERISA itself "does not regulate the substantive content of welfare-benefit plans." Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 732 (1985). Thus,
unless an employer contractually cedes its freedom, see, e. g.,
Adcox v. Teledyne, Inc., 21 F. 3d 1381, 1389 (CA6), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 871 (1994), it is "generally free under ERISA,
for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate
[its] welfare pla[n]." Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 78 (1995).
The flexibility an employer enjoys to amend or eliminate
its welfare plan is not an accident; Congress recognized that
"requir[ing] the vesting of these ancillary benefits would seriously complicate the administration and increase the cost
of plans." S. Rep. No. 93-383, p. 51 (1973). Giving employers this flexibility also encourages them to offer more generous benefits at the outset, since they are free to reduce benefits should economic conditions sour. If employers were
locked into the plans they initially offered, "they would err
initially on the side of omission." Heath v. Varity Corp., 71
F. 3d 256, 258 (CA7 1995). Section 510 counterbalances this
flexibility by ensuring that employers do not "circumvent the
provision of promised benefits." Ingersoll-Rand Co., supra,
at 143 (citing S. Rep. No. 93-127, pp. 35-36 (1973); H. R. Rep.
No. 93-533, p. 17 (1973)). In short, "§510 helps to make
promises credible." Heath, supra, at 258. An employer

516

Opinion of the Court

may, of course, retain the unfettered right to alter its promises, but to do so it must follow the formal procedures set
forth in the plan. See 29 U. S. C. § 1102(b)(3) (requiring plan
to "provide a procedure for amending such plan"); Schoonejongen, supra, at 78 (observing that the "cognizable claim
[under ERISA] is that the company did not [amend its welfare benefit plan] in a permissible manner"). Adherence to
these formal procedures "increases the likelihood that proposed plan amendments, which are fairly serious events,
are recognized as such and given the special consideration
they deserve." Schoonejongen, supra, at 82. The formal
amendment process would be undermined if § 510 did not
apply because employers could "informally" amend their
plans one participant at a time. Thus, the power to amend
or abolish a welfare benefit plan does not include the power
to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against" the plan's participants and beneficiaries "for
the purpose of interfering with [their] attainment of...
right[s] ... under the plan." To be sure, when an employer
acts without this purpose, as could be the case when making
fundamental business decisions, such actions are not barred
by § 510. But in the case where an employer acts with a
purpose that triggers the protection of § 510, any tension
that might exist between an employer's power to amend the
plan and a participant's rights under §510 is the product of
a careful balance of competing interests, and is most surely
not the type of "absurd or glaringly unjust" result, Ingalls
Shipbuilding,Inc. v. Director,Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,519 U. S. 248, 261 (1997), that would warrant
departure from the plain language of § 510.
Respondents argue that the Court of Appeals' decision
must nevertheless be affirmed because § 510, when applied
to benefits that do not "vest," only protects an employee's
right to cross the "threshold of eligibility" for welfare benefits. See Brief for Respondent Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway Co. et al. 18. In other words, argue respondents,

Cite as: 520 U. S. 510 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

an employee who is eligible to receive benefits under an
ERISA welfare benefit plan has already "attain[ed]" her
"right[s]" under the plan, so that any subsequent actions
taken by an employer cannot, by definition, "interfer[e]" with
the "attainment of... right[s]" under the plan. According
to respondents, petitioners were eligible to receive welfare
benefits under the SFTS-Teamsters plan at the time they
were discharged, so they cannot state a claim under § 510.
The Court of Appeals' approach precluded it from evaluating
this argument, and others presented to us, and we see no
reason not to allow it the first opportunity to consider these
matters on remand.
We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
