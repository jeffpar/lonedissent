McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY, ALABAMA
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-542. Argued March 18, 1997-Decided June 2, 1997
After spending six years on Alabama's death row, petitioner's capital
murder conviction was reversed on the ground that the State had
suppressed exculpatory evidence. He then sued respondent Monroe
County and others under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 for the allegedly unconstitutional actions of, inter alios, County Sheriff Tom Tate in suppressing
the evidence. A county is liable under §1983 for those actions of its
sheriff that constitute county "policy." Monell v. New York City Dept.
of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694. The District Court dismissed the
claims, holding that Tate's unlawful acts did not represent Monroe
County's policy, because an Alabama county has no authority to make
law enforcement policy. The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that
a sheriff acting in his law enforcement capacity is not a policymaker for
the county.
Held. Alabama sheriffs, when executing their law enforcement duties,
represent the State of Alabama, not their counties. Pp. 784-796.
(a) In determining a local government's § 1983 liability, a court's task
is to identify those who speak with final policymaking authority for the
local governmental actor concerning the action alleged to have caused
the violation at issue. Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491
U. S. 701, 737. The parties agree that Sheriff Tate has final policymaking authority in the area of law enforcement, but they disagree about
whether Alabama sheriffs are policymakers for the State or the county
when acting in their law enforcement capacity. In deciding this dispute, the question is not whether Alabama sheriffs act as county or state
officials in all of their official actions, but whom they represent in a
particular area or on a particular issue. Ibid. This inquiry is dependent on the definition of the official's functions under relevant state law.
Cf. Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425,429, n. 5. Pp. 784-786.
(b) The Court defers considerably to the Court of Appeals' expertise
in interpreting Alabama law, see Jett, supra, at 738, and concludes that
the State's constitutional provisions concerning sheriffs, the historical
development of those provisions, and the interpretation given them by
the State Supreme Court strongly support Monroe County's contention
that sheriffs represent the State when acting in their law enforcement
capacity. The relevant portions of the Alabama Code, although less

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY
Syllabus
compelling, also support this conclusion. Code provisions cutting in
favor of the conclusion that sheriffs are county officials are insufficient
to tip the balance in petitioner's favor. Pp. 786-793.
(c) The Court rejects petitioner's arguments that the result here
will create a lack of uniformity in Alabama-by allowing 67 county sheriffs to have different state law enforcement policies in their countiesand throughout the country-by permitting sheriffs to be classified as
state officials in some States and county officials in others. The common law itself envisioned the possibility that state law enforcement
"policies" might vary locally, as particular sheriffs adopted varying practices for arresting criminals or securing evidence. And the Nation's
federal nature allows the States wide authority to set up their state and
local governments as they wish. Petitioner's and his amici's concern
that state and local governments will manipulate local officials' titles
in a blatant effort to shield local governments from liability is foreclosed by St. Louis v. Praprotnik,485 U. S. 112, 127 (plurality opinion).

Opinion of the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner sued Monroe County, Alabama, under Rev. Stat.
§ 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, for allegedly unconstitutional actions taken by Monroe County Sheriff Tom Tate. If the
sheriff's actions constitute county "policy," then the county
is liable for them. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978). The parties agree that the
sheriff is a "policymaker" for § 1983 purposes, but they disagree about whether he is a policymaker for Monroe County
or for the State of Alabama. We hold that, as to the actions
at issue here, Sheriff Tate represents the State of Alabama
and is therefore not a county policymaker. We thus affirm
the Court of Appeals' dismissal of petitioner's § 1983 claims
against Monroe County.
I
In November 1986, Ronda Morrison was murdered in Monroe County, a sparsely populated county located in southwest
Alabama. Petitioner and one Ralph Myers were indicted for
this crime. Myers then pleaded guilty to a lesser offense
and testified against petitioner at his trial. A jury convicted
petitioner of capital murder, and the trial court sentenced
him to death. After two remands, the Alabama Court of
Criminal Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction, holding
that the State had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83
(1963), by suppressing statements from Myers that contradicted his trial testimony and other exculpatory evidence.
McMillian v. State, 616 So. 2d 933, 942-948 (1993). Thus,
after spending six years in prison, petitioner was released.
He then brought this § 1983 lawsuit in the District Court
for the Middle District of Alabama against respondent Monroe County and numerous officials, including the three men
in charge of investigating the Morrison murder-Tom Tate,
the Sheriff of Monroe County; Larry Ikner, an investigator
with the District Attorney's office in Monroe County; and
Simon Benson, an investigator with the Alabama Bureau of

Opinion of the Court

Investigation. Only two of the officials were sued in their
official capacities-Sheriff Tate and investigator Ikner-and
it is only these official-capacity suits that concern us here.'
Petitioner principally alleged that Tate and Ikner, in their
capacities as officials of Monroe County, not as officers of the
State of Alabama, intimidated Myers into making false statements and suppressed exculpatory evidence. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 26a-33a; McMillian v. Johnson, 878 F. Supp. 1473,
1486-1488 (MD Ala. 1995).
The District Court dismissed the claims against Monroe
County and the claims against Tate and Ikner in their official
capacities. The court held that "any unlawful acts of Defendants Tate and Ikner cannot be said to represent [Monroe] County's policy," because "an Alabama county has [no]
authority to make policy in the area of law enforcement."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. Petitioner appealed the District
Court's decision as to Sheriff Tate. The Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District
Court that "Sheriff Tate is not a final policymaker for Monroe County in the area of law enforcement, because Monroe
County has no law enforcement authority." McMillian v.
Johnson, 88 F. 3d 1573, 1583 (1996). We granted certiorari,

said to represent official policy." Ibid. A court's task is to

Opinion of the Court

"identify those officials or governmental bodies who speak
with final policymaking authority for the local governmental
actor concerning the action alleged to have caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at issue." Jett v.
Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U. S. 701, 737 (1989).
Here, the parties agree that Sheriff Tate has "final policymaking authority" in the area of law enforcement. They
sharply disagree, however, about whether Alabama sheriffs
are policymakers for the State or2for the county when they
act in a law enforcement capacity.
In deciding this dispute, our inquiry is guided by two principles. First, the question is not whether Sheriff Tate acts
for Alabama or Monroe County in some categorical, "all or
nothing" manner. Our cases on the liability of local governments under § 1983 instruct us to ask whether governmental
officials are final policymakers for the local government in a
particular area, or on a particular issue. See ibid. (court
must identify "those officials who have the power to make
official policy on a particularissue" (emphasis added)); id.,
at 738 (question is whether school district superintendent

485 U. S. 112, 123 (1988) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy
adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law
for making policy in that areaof the city's business"). Thus,
we are not seeking to make a characterization of Alabama
sheriffs that will hold true for every type of official action
they engage in. We simply ask whether Sheriff Tate repre2 We have explained that a suit against a governmental officer "in his
official capacity" is the same as a suit "'against [the] entity of which [the]
officer is an agent,"' Kentucky v. Graham,473 U. S. 159, 165 (1985) (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 690,
n. 55 (1978)), and that victory in such an "official-capacity" suit "imposes
liability on the entity that [the officer] represents," Brandon v. Holt, 469
U. S. 464, 471 (1985).

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY

Opinion of the Court

sents the State or the county when he acts in a law enforcement capacity.
Second, our inquiry is dependent on an analysis of state
law. Cf. Jett, supra,at 737 (" '[W]hether a particular official
has "final policymaking authority" is a question of state law"'
(quoting, with original emphasis, Praprotnik,supra, at 123
(plurality opinion))); Pembaur v. Cincinnati,475 U. S. 469,
483 (1986) (plurality opinion) (same). This is not to say that
state law can answer the question for us by, for example,
simply labeling as a state official an official who clearly
makes county policy. But our understanding of the actual
function of a governmental official, in a particular area, will
necessarily be dependent on the definition of the official's
functions under relevant state law. Cf. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429, n. 5 (1997) ("[The] federal
question can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency's character").
B
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit determined
that under Alabama law, a sheriff acting in his law enforcement capacity is not a policymaker for the county. Since the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals includes Alabama, we
defer considerably to that court's expertise in interpreting
Alabama law.3 See Jett, supra, at 738 ("We think the Court
of Appeals [for the Fifth Circuit], whose expertise in interpreting Texas law is greater than our own, is in a better
position to determine whether [the school district superintendent] possessed final policymaking authority in the area
of employee transfers"); Pembaur,supra, at 484, n. 13 ("We

We note that two of the three judges on the Eleventh Circuit's panel
are based in Alabama. In addition, this is the second Eleventh Circuit
panel to have reached this conclusion. See Swint v. Wadley, 5 F. 3d 1435,
1450-1451 (1993), vacated for lack of appellate jurisdiction, 514 U. S. 35
(1995).

Opinion of the Court

generally accord great deference to the interpretation and
application of state law by the courts of appeals").
We begin with the Alabama Constitution, "the supreme
law of the state." Alexander v. State ex rel. Carver, 150
So. 2d 204, 208 (Ala. 1963). We agree with the Court of Appeals that the constitutional provisions concerning sheriffs,
the historical development of those provisions, and the interpretation given them by the Alabama Supreme Court
strongly support Monroe County's contention that sheriffs
represent the State, at least for some purposes. Alabama's
Constitution, adopted in 1901, states that "[t]he executive department shall consist of a governor, lieutenant governor,
attorney-general, state auditor, secretary of state, state
treasurer, superintendent of education, commissioner of agriculture and industries, and a sheriff for each county." Ala.
Const. of 1901, Art. V, § 112. This designation is especially
important for our purposes, because although every Alabama
Constitution has included sheriffs as constitutional officers
and has provided for their election by county voters, see Ala.
Const. of 1819, Art. IV, §24; Ala. Const. of 1861, Art. IV, §24;
Ala. Const. of 1865, Art. VII, § 3; Ala. Const. of 1867, Art. V,
§21; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, §26; Ala. Const. of 1901,
Art. V, § 138, sheriffs have not always been explicitly listed
as members of the state "executive department." Thus, the
1867 Constitution listed only the "governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and attorney
general" as constituting "the executive department." Ala.
Const. of 1867, Art. V, § 1. This changed with the 1875 Constitution, when sheriffs and the superintendent of education
4
were added to the list. Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, § 1.
4Executive department officers have to take the constitutional oath of
office, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. XVII, §279; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. XV,
§ 1, and are required to submit written reports to the Governor on demand. Submitting a false report was originally a crime, Ala. Const. of
1875, Art. V, §9, and is now an impeachable offense, Ala. Const. of 1901,
Art. V, § 121.

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY

Opinion of the Court

The framers of the 1901 Constitution took two significant
steps in an attempt to solidify the place of sheriffs in the
executive department, and to clarify that sheriffs were acting for the State when exercising their law enforcement
functions. First, faced with reports that sheriffs were
allowing mobs to abduct prisoners and lynch them, the framers made such "neglect" by sheriffs an impeachable offense.
See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, § 138 ("Whenever any prisoner is taken from jail, or from the custody of any sheriff or
his deputy, and put to death, or suffers grievous bodily harm,
owing to the neglect, connivance, cowardice, or other grave
fault of the sheriff, such sheriff may be impeached"); State
ex rel. Garber v. Cazalas, 162 Ala. 210, 50 So. 296 (1909)
(sheriff's failure to close jail doors, resulting in lynching of
prisoner, constitutes impeachable offense); M. McMillan,
Constitutional Development in Alabama, 1789-1901, p. 338,
n. 186 (1955) (impeachment provision resulted in "much progress made against lynching").
Second, authority to impeach sheriffs was moved from the
county courts to the State Supreme Court, because of "[t]he
failure of county courts to punish sheriffs for neglect of
duty." Parker v. Amerson, 519 So. 2d 442, 443 (Ala. 1987).
One of the primary purposes of this change, proposed by
ex-Governor Thomas Goode Jones at the 1901 Convention,
was "to augment the power of the Governor." Id., at 444.
After this change, the Governor could order the State Supreme Court, rather than the county court, to begin impeachment proceedings against a wayward sheriff, and
would not have to worry that local support for the sheriff
would annul his effort at centralized control. See ibid.;
Strengthening the Power of the Executive, Address of
Emmet O'Neal, Governor of Alabama, pp. 9-10 (Sept. 12,
1911) (new impeachment provision increases Governor's control of sheriffs and "gives the Executive real power which
is respected and feared"). Thus, sheriffs now share the
same impeachment procedures as state legal officers and
lower state court judges, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. VII, § 174,

Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

rather than county and municipal officers, Ala. Const. of 1875,
Art. VII, §3.
Critically for our case, the Alabama Supreme Court has
interpreted these provisions and their historical background
as evidence of "the framers' intent to ensure that sheriffs
be considered executive officers of the state." Parker,519
So. 2d, at 444. Based primarily on this understanding of
the State Constitution, the court has held unequivocally that
sheriffs are state officers, and that tort claims brought
against sheriffs based on their official acts therefore constitute suits against the State, not suits against the sheriff's
county. Id., at 443-445.5 Thus, Alabama counties are not
liable under a theory of respondeat superiorfor a sheriff's
official acts that are tortious. Id., at 442. The issues in
Parkerare strikingly similar to the ones in the present case,
and that decision is therefore strong evidence in favor of the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that sheriffs act on behalf of
the State, rather than the county, when acting in their law
enforcement capacity.
Turning from the Alabama Constitution to the Alabama
Code, the relevant provisions are less compelling, but still
support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals to some extent. Section 36-22-3 of the code sets out a sheriff's duties.
First, a sheriff must "attend upon" the state courts in his
county, must "obey the lawful orders and directions" of those
courts, and must "execute and return the process and orders" of any state court, even those outside his county. Ala.
Code §§ 36-22-3(1), (2) (1991). Thus, judges (who are state
officers, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Amdt. 328, § 6.01) may order
5

As a result of this holding and the State Constitution's sovereign immunity provision, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. I, § 14 ("[T]he State of
Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity"),
the Alabama Supreme Court has held that a sheriff is absolutely immune
from all suits for damages based on his official acts. Parkerv. Amerson,
519 So. 2d 442, 446 (Ala. 1987). See also King v. Colbert County, 620
So. 2d 623, 626 (Ala. 1993); Boshell v. Walker County Sheriff, 598 So. 2d
843, 844 (Ala. 1992); Hereford v. Jefferson County, 586 So. 2d 209, 210
(Ala. 1991).

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

the sheriff to take certain actions, even if the judge sits in a
distant county. And under Ala. Code §12-17-24 (1995), the
presiding circuit judge "exercise[s] a general supervision"
over the county sheriffs in his circuit,6 just as if the sheriffs
are normal "court [i. e., state] employees," see § 12-17-1.
Second, the sheriff must give to the county treasurer a
sworn written statement detailing the funds he has received
for the county since his last statement, and must pay these
funds to the treasurer. § 36-22-3(3). In contrast to the
state judges, however, the county treasurer does not appear
to have any statutory authority to direct the sheriff to take
specific actions.
Third and most importantly, "[i]t shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties, by themselves or deputies,
to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest criminals and,
insofar as within their power, to secure evidence of crimes
in their counties and to present a report of the evidence so
secured to the district attorney or assistant district attorney
for the county." § 36-22-3(4). By this mandate, sheriffs
are given complete authority to enforce the state criminal
law in their counties. In contrast, the "powers and duties"
of the counties themselves-creatures of the State who have
only the powers granted to them by the State, Alexander,
150 So. 2d, at 206-do not include any provision in the area
of law enforcement. Ala. Code § 11-3-11 (1989). Thus, the
"governing body" of the counties-which in every Alabama
county is the county commission, see Calvert v. Cullman
County Comm'n, 669 So. 2d 119 (Ala. 1995) (citing § 111-5)-cannot instruct the sheriff how to ferret out crime,
how to arrest a criminal, or how to secure evidence of a
crime. And when the sheriff does secure such evidence, he
has an obligation to share this information not with the
county commission, but with the district attorney (a state
official, see Hooks v. Hitt, 539 So. 2d 157, 159 (Ala. 1988)).
6Seventeen of the forty judicial circuits in Alabama contain more than
one county, including the circuit in which Monroe County sits. Ala. Code
§ 12-11-2 (1995).

Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

While the county commission thus has no direct control
over how the sheriff fulfills his law enforcement duty, the
Governor and the attorney general do have this kind of control. Pursuant to § 36-22-5, they can direct the sheriff to
investigate "any alleged violation of law in their counties."
And after "proceed[ing] promptly" to complete this investigation, the sheriff must "promptly" write a report to the
state official in charge of the investigation, stating his findings, listing the witnesses he has secured, and summarizing
what the witnesses can prove. Ibid. In addition, the salaries of all sheriffs are set by the state legislature, not by the
county commissions. §36-22-16.
To all of this, petitioner counters with four important provisions that cut in favor of the conclusion that sheriffs are
county officials. First, the sheriff's salary is paid "out of the
county treasury." Ibid. Second, the county provides the
sheriff with equipment (including cruisers), supplies, lodging, and reimbursement for expenses, to the extent "reasonably needed for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs
of the sheriff's office." § 36-22-18. Third, the sheriff's jurisdiction is limited to the borders of his county. See, e. g.,
§36-22-3(4) ("It shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties . . . to ferret out crime" (emphasis added)).
Fourth, the sheriff is elected locally by the voters in his
county (as he has been since Alabama's 1819 Constitution).
See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, § 138; Ala. Const. of 1819,
Art. IV, §24.
We do not find these provisions sufficient to tip the balance
in favor of petitioner. The county's payment of the sheriff's
salary does not translate into control over him, since the
county neither has the authority to change his salary nor the
discretion to refuse payment completely. The county commissions do appear to have the discretion to deny funds to
the sheriffs for their operations beyond what is "reasonably
necessary." See Etowah County Comm'n v. Hayes, 569
So. 2d 397, 399 (Ala. 1990) (per curiam). But at most, this

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

discretion would allow the commission to exert an attenuated and indirect influence over the sheriff's operations.
Petitioner's contention that sheriffs are county officials because "state policymakers" typically make policy for the entire State (without limits on their jurisdiction) and are typically elected on a statewide (not local) basis, surely has some
force. But district attorneys and state judges are often considered (and in Alabama are considered) state officials, even
though they, too, have limited jurisdictions and are elected
locally. These characteristics are therefore consistent with
an understanding of the 67 Alabama sheriffs as state officials
who have been locally placed throughout the State, with an
element of control granted to the officials and residents of
the county that receives the sheriff's services.7
7

Petitioner also makes three other points that we believe have little
merit. First, he points out that when the sheriff's office is vacant or when
the sheriff is incapacitated, it is the county coroner that fills in for the
sheriff. Ala. Code § 11-5-5 (1989). We note that this temporary assignment only lasts until the Governor appoints a replacement for the sheriff,
who then serves out the remainder of the sheriff's term. Ala. Code §369-17 (1991). Thus, even assuming that the county coroner is a county
official, we place little weight on this assignment of temporary responsibility, which by its nature must fall to an official who is already in the county
and available to step in for the sheriff at any time. Second, petitioner
cites several instances in the code where a group of officials that includes
the sheriff is designated a group of "county officials" or "county employees." See, e.g., §§ 36-3-4, 36-15-1, 36-22-16. But in light of the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (i) sheriffs are state officials according to the State Constitution, see Parker, 519 So. 2d, at 443, and (ii)
contrary statements in that court's prior decisions had ignored the Constitution and therefore should not be followed, id., at 445 (citing, among other
cases, In re Opinions of Justices, 225 Ala. 359, 143 So. 345 (1932)), we
think that any contrary implication in the code is entitled to little weight.
Finally, petitioner relies on the Monroe County Commission's insurance
policy-which, according to the District Court, 'may cover ...some, but
not all, of the claims made against" Monroe County and Sheriff Tate in this
suit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a-to establish that the commission will pay
any judgment rendered against Sheriff Tate. But this policy shows, at the
most, that there was uncertainty as to whether the courts would con-

Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)

Opinion of the Court

In sum, although there is some evidence in Alabama law
that supports petitioner's argument, we think the weight of
the evidence is strongly on the side of the conclusion reached
by the Court of Appeals: Alabama sheriffs, when executing
their law enforcement duties, represent the State of Alabama, not their counties. Cf. Praprotnik,485 U. S., at 125
('We are not, of course, predicting that state law will always
speak with perfect clarity"); id., at 126-127 ("It may not be
possible to draw an elegant line that will resolve this
conundrum").
C
Petitioner argues that this conclusion will create a lack of
uniformity in Alabama and throughout the country. First,
he argues that it is anomalous to have 67 different "state
policymakers" in the person of Alabama's 67 county sheriffs,
all of whom may have different "state law enforcement policies" in their counties. Second, he points out that most Federal Courts of Appeals have found county sheriffs to be
county, not state, officials, and he implies that our affirmance
of the Court of Appeals will either call those decisions into
question or create an unacceptable patchwork of rulings as
to § 1983 liability of counties for the acts of their sheriffs.
We reject both arguments: The first ignores the history of
sheriffs, and the second ignores our Nation's federal nature.
English sheriffs (or "shire-reeves") were the King's
"reeves" (officers or agents) in the "shires" (counties), at least
after the Norman Conquest in 1066. See C. Wigan & D.
Meston, Mather on Sheriff and Execution Law 1-2 (1935).
Although chosen locally by the shire's inhabitants, the sheriff
did "all the king's business in the county," 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 328 (1765), and was
"the keeper of the king's peace," id., at 332. See also
Wigan & Meston, supra, at 2 ("It is this position of the Shersider Sheriff Tate a county policymaker in these circumstances, not that
the county would pay any judgment against him.

iff as the executive officer of the Crown which has all along
been the outstanding characteristic of the office").
As the basic forms of English government were transplanted in our country, it also became the common understanding here that the sheriff, though limited in jurisdiction
to his county and generally elected by county voters,8 was in
reality an officer of the State, and ultimately represented the
State in fulfilling his duty to keep the peace. See, e.g.,
Wager, Introduction, in County Government Across the Nation 5 (P. Wager ed. 1950) ("The office of sheriff has an unbroken lineage from the Anglo-Saxon shire-reeve"); 1 W. Anderson, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs, Coroners and
Constables 5 (1941) ("In the exercise of executive and administrative functions, in conserving the public peace, in vindicating the law, and in preserving the rights of the government, he (the sheriff) represents the sovereignty of the State
and he has no superior in his county"); R. Cooley, Handbook
on the Law of Municipal Corporations 512 (1914) ("Sheriffs,
coroners, clerks and other so-called county officers are properly state officers for the county. Their functions and duties
pertain chiefly to the affairs of state in the county"); 3 J.
Bouvier, Bouvier's Law Dictionary 3058 (8th ed. 1914) (defining sheriff as "[a] county officer representing the executive
or administrative power of the state within his county").
This historical sketch indicates that the common law itself
envisioned the possibility that state law enforcement "policies" might vary locally, as particular sheriffs adopted varying practices for arresting criminals or securing evidence.9

Opinion of the Court

Thus, petitioner's disagreement with the concept that
"county sheriffs" may actually be state officials is simply a
disagreement with the ancient understanding of what it has
meant to be a sheriff.
Petitioner's second concern is that under our holding here,
sheriffs will be characterized differently in different States.
But while it might be easier to decide cases arising under
§ 1983 and MoneUl if we insisted on a uniform, national characterization for all sheriffs, such a blunderbuss approach
would ignore a crucial axiom of our government: the States
have wide authority to set up their state and local governments as they wish. Understandably, then, the importance
of counties and the nature of county government have varied
historically from region to region, and from State to State.
See, e. g., Wager, supra, at 5-8 (describing different systems
of rural government that developed in the Massachusetts,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia colonies, which later
resulted in counties having widely varying roles in the four
regions); Martin, American County Government, in County
Governments in an Era of Change 3-5 (P. Berman ed. 1993)
(same); DeSantis & Renner, Governing the County, id., at
16-25 (describing varying levels of power currently exercised by counties in different States, and explaining how regional influences have resulted in different forms of county
government in different States); id., at 19 (listing Alabama
as 37th among the 50 States in amount of discretionary authority granted to its counties). Thus, since it is entirely
natural that both the role of sheriffs and the importance of
counties vary from State to State, there is no inconsistency
created by court decisions that declare sheriffs to be county
officers in one State, and not in another. 10

The final concern of petitioner and his amici is that state
and local governments will manipulate the titles of local officials in a blatant effort to shield the local governments from
liability. But such efforts are already foreclosed by our decision in Praprotnik. See 485 U. S., at 127 (plurality opinion) ("[E]gregious attempts by local governments to insulate
themselves from liability for unconstitutional policies are
precluded" by allowing plaintiffs to prove that "a widespread
practice" has been established by "'custom or usage' with
the force of law"). And there is certainly no evidence of
such manipulation here; indeed, the Alabama provisions that
cut most strongly against petitioner's position predate our
decision in Monell by some time.

Seeking redress for an arrest and'years of incarceration
in violation of his federal constitutional rights, McMillian
commenced the instant action under 42 U.S. C. § 1983.
He named as defendants both Monroe County and the County's Sheriff, Tom Tate. McMillian alleged that Sheriff Tate
withheld exculpatory evidence, generated false, inculpatory
evidence, and subjected him to gross racial insults and relentless intimidation.
Sheriff Tate, it is uncontested, has "final policymaking authority" under Alabama law over matters of law enforcement
in Monroe County. Our precedent instructs that, if the
sheriff makes policy for the State, Monroe County would not
be accountable, under § 1983, for that policy; if, on the other
hand, the sheriff acts as law enforcement policymaker for
Monroe County, then the county would be answerable under
§ 1983. See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,
436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978).
Alabama has 67 county sheriffs, each elected, paid, and
equipped locally, each with countywide, not statewide, authority. Unlike judges who work within the State's judicial
hierarchy, or prosecutors who belong to a prosecutorial corps
superintended by the State's Attorney General, sheriffs are
not part of a state command and serve under no "State Sheriff General." The Court, nonetheless, holds that the policies
set by Sheriff Tate in Monroe County, though discrete from,
and uncoordinated with, the policies of sheriffs in other counties, "may fairly be said to represent [Alabama] policy." See
ibid. I disagree.

In my view, Alabama law defining the office of sheriff indicates that the sheriff acts within and for the county when
setting and implementing law enforcement policy.' In ex' The Court observes that this Court must "defer considerably" to the

Eleventh Circuit's construction of Alabama law. See ante, at 786. But
cf Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 231 (1991) (courts of
appeals review de novo district courts' state-law determinations). Deference, however, does not supplant careful review, see St. Louis v. Praprot-

plaining why it concludes otherwise and deems the sheriff
the State's, not the county's, policymaker, the Court leans
heavily on provisions of the State's Constitution. The Court
relies on the Alabama Constitution's designation of "a sheriff
for each county" as a member of the State's "executive department." See Ala. Const., Art. V, § 112; ante, at 787. In
addition, the Court points to two 1901 amendments relating to the impeachment of sheriffs. See ante, at 788-789.
These measures are the strongest supports for the Court's
classification of county sheriffs as state actors. They are not
sturdy enough, however, to justify the Court's holding that
county sheriffs are state officials.
Alabama law does not consistently designate sheriffs as
"executive department" officers; instead, Alabama law in
several instances refers to sheriffs as county officials. See
In re Opinions of Justices, 225 Ala. 359, 143 So. 345 (1932)
(sheriffs are county officers for purposes of 1912 constitutional amendment regarding county officers' salaries); Ala.
Code §36-3-4(a) (1991) (sheriff, a "county officer," shall be
elected to four-year term); Ala. Code §36-22-16(a) (1991)
(sheriffs shall be compensated out of the county treasury in
same manner as "other county employees"). Moreover, designations Alabama attaches to sheriffs in its laws and decisions are not dispositive of a court's assessment of Sheriff
Tate's status for § 1983 purposes. Cf. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425, 429, n. 5 (1997); Howlett v. Rose,
496 U. S. 356, 376 (1990) (defenses to § 1983 actions are questions of federal law); Martinez v. California,444 U. S. 277,
284, and n. 8 (1980) (state law granting immunity to parole
officers does not control question whether such officers have
immunity under § 1983). If a State's designation sufficed to

free to nullify for their own people the legislative decisions
that Congress has made on behalf of all the People." Howlett, 496 U. S., at 383.
Nor are the 1901 impeachment measures secure indicators
that a sheriff acts on behalf of the State, not the county.
As the Court explains, the impeachment amendments were
intended to provide a state check on county sheriffs in view
of their glaring lapses in acquiescing to abductions and
lynchings in the late 1800's. See ante, at 788. However,
making an officer eligible for impeachment, by itself, does
not change the governmental unit to which the officer belongs. See Ala. Const., Art. VII, § 175 (listing numerous
county officials subject to impeachment); Ala. Code § 36-111(a) (1991) (same). And transferring impeachment proceedings from county courts to the State Supreme Court, see
Ala. Const., Art. VII, § 174, is sensibly seen as an acknowledgment of the power wielded by sheriffs within their own
counties, and the consequent need for placement of removal
authority outside a sheriff's bailiwick. Furthermore, impeachment of sheriffs is not a power reserved exclusively
to state officials; "five resident taxpayers" of the sheriff's
county can initiate an impeachment. See Ala. Code § 3611-6 (1991). Impeachment, in sum, provides an ultimate
check on flagrant behavior, but does not serve as a tight control rein.
The prime controllers of a sheriff's service are the county
residents, the people who select their sheriff at quadrennial
elections. Sheriff Tate owes his position as chief law enforcement officer of Monroe County to the county residents
who elected him, and who can unseat him. See Ala. Const.,
Art. V, § 138, as amended by Amdt. No. 35 ("A sheriff shall
be elected in each county by the qualified electors thereof
... ."). On the ballot, candidates for the office of sheriff are
grouped with candidates for other county offices, and are not
listed with state office candidates. See Ala. Code § 17-8-5
(1995).

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY
GINSBURG,

J., dissenting

Traditionally, Alabama sheriffs have had autonomy to formulate and execute law enforcement policy within the geographic confines of their counties. Under Alabama law, "[iut
shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties...
to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest criminals and
...

to secure evidence of crimes."

Ala. Code § 36-22-3(4)

(1991) (emphasis added); see also Ala. Code § 15-6-1 (1995)
("The sheriff is the principal conservator of the peace in his
county, and it is his duty to suppress riots, unlawful assemblies and affrays. In the execution of such duty, he may
summon to his aid as many of the men of his county as he
thinks proper." (emphasis added)); § 15-10-1 (sheriffs may
make arrests "within their respective counties").
Monroe County pays Sheriff Tate's salary, see Ala. Code
§36-22-16(a) (1991) (sheriffs shall be paid "out of the county
treasury as the salaries of other county employees are paid"),
and the sheriff operates out of an office provided, furnished,
and equipped by the county, see §36-22-18. The obligation
to fully equip the sheriff is substantial, requiring a county
commission to "furnish the sheriff with the necessary quarters, books, stationery, office equipment, supplies, postage
and other conveniences and equipment, including automobiles and necessary repairs, maintenance and all expenses
incidental thereto." Ibid. These obligations are of practical importance, for they mean that purse strings can be
pulled at the county level; a county is obliged to provide a
sheriff only what is "reasonablyneeded for the proper and
efficient conduct of the affairs of the sheriff's office," ibid.
(emphasis added). How generously the sheriff will be
equipped is likely to influence that officer's day-to-day conduct to a greater extent than the remote prospect of impeachment. See ibid.; see also Geneva Cty. Comm'n v. Tice,
578 So. 2d 1070, 1075 (Ala. 1991) (county may reasonably limit
budget for overtime pay for sheriff's deputies); Ala. Code

increased "by law by general or local act"); § 36-22-3(3)
(sheriff must render to county treasurer a periodic written
statement of moneys collected by sheriff on behalf of county).
Sheriff Tate, in short, is in vital respects a county official.
Indeed, one would be hard pressed to think of a single official
who more completely represents the exercise of significant
power within a county. See Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 746
F. 2d 337, 340-341 (CA6 1984) (sheriff elected by residents
of county to be county's chief law enforcement officer, paid
and equipped by county, is "obvious[ly]" a county official),
rev'd on other grounds, 475 U. S. 469 (1986).2
The Court observes that it is "most importan[t]" to its
holding that Alabama sheriffs "are given complete authority
to enforce the state criminal law in their counties." See
ante, at 790. If the Court means to suggest that Sheriff
Tate should be classified as a state actor because he is enforcing state (as opposed to county or municipal) law, the Court
proves far too much. Because most criminal laws are of
statewide application, relying on whose law the sheriff enforces yields an all-state categorization of sheriffs, despite
the Court's recognition that such blanket classification is
inappropriate. See ante, at 786. Sheriffs in Arkansas,
Texas, and Washington, just like sheriffs in Alabama, enforce

The majority of Courts of Appeals to have addressed this question
have similarly concluded that sheriffs, when engaged in a variety of activities, are county actors. See, e. g., cases cited ante, at 795-796, n. 10; see
also Parkerv. Williams, 862 F. 2d 1471, 1477-1481 (CAll 1989) (Alabama

F. 2d 232, 234-235 (CAll 1987) (Florida sheriff acts for county in hiring
and firing deputies); Weber v. Dell, 804 F. 2d 796, 802-803 (CA2 1986)
(New York sheriff acts for county in setting county jail strip search policy);

acts for county in setting county jail strip search policy). But see Soderbeck v. Burnett, 821 F. 2d 446, 451-452 (CA7 1987) (Wisconsin sheriff acts

the State's law, but that does not make them policymakers
for the State rather than the county. See ante, at 795-796,
n. 10.
In emphasizing that the Monroe County Commission cannot instruct Sheriff Tate how to accomplish his law enforcement mission, see ante, at 790, the Court indirectly endorses
the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning: Because under Alabama
law a county commission does not possess law enforcement
authority, a sheriff's law enforcement activities cannot represent county policy. See McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F. 3d
1573, 1578 (CAll 1996). There is an irony in this approach:
If a county commission lacks law enforcement authority, then
the sheriff becomes a state official; but if a county commission possesses such authority and directs the sheriff's activities, then the sheriff presumably would not be afinal policymaker in the realm of law enforcement, see St. Louis v.
Praprotnik,485 U. S. 112, 127 (1988) (plurality opinion).
Moreover, in determining who makes county policy, this
Court has never reasoned that all policymaking authority
must be vested in a single body that either exercises that
power or formally delegates it to another. Few local governments would fit that rigid model. Cf. id., at 124-125
("The States have extremely wide latitude in determining
[O]ne may exthe form that local government takes ....
pect to find a rich variety of ways in which the power of
government is distributed among a host of different officials
and official bodies."). Nor does Monell support such a constricted view of the exercise of municipal authority; there,
we spoke of § 1983 liability for acts by "lawmakers or by
those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent
official policy." 436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). In this
case, Sheriff Tate is "the county's final policymaker in the
area of law enforcement, not by virtue of delegation by the
county's governing body but, rather, by virtue of the office
to which the sheriff has been elected." Turner v. Upton
Cty., 915 F. 2d 133, 136 (CA5 1990); see also Blackburn v.
Snow, 771 F. 2d 556, 571 (CA1 1985); accord, Vera v. Tue, 73

F. 3d 604, 609 (CA5 1996) ("[Tlhe Sheriff, an elected county
official [in Texas], had equal authority to the county commissioners in that jurisdiction [so] that his actions constituted
those of the county just as much as those of the commissioners."). An Alabama sheriff is a county policymaker because
he independently exercises law enforcement authority for
the county. In this most crucial respect, the Alabama arrangement resembles the "unique structure of county government" in Texas. See Turner, 915 F. 2d, at 136-137, cited
ante, at 796, n. 10.
The Court also suggests that because the Governor can
direct a sheriff to investigate a violation of law in the county,
an Alabama sheriff must be a state, not a county, official.
See ante, at 791 (citing Ala. Code §36-22-5 (1991)). It is
worth noting that a group of county citizens can likewise
trigger an investigation by the sheriff. See § 36-22-6(b).
The respondent, Monroe County, did not inform us whether
the Governor directs county sheriffs to conduct investigations with any regularity. More important, there is no suggestion that Sheriff Tate was proceeding under the Governor's direction when Tate pursued the investigation that led
to McMillian's Death Row confinement. If Sheriff Tate were
acting on instruction from the Governor, this would be a
very different case. But the bare possibility that a Governor might sometime direct a sheriff's law enforcement activities does not lessen the sheriff's authority, as the final tounty
policymaker, in the general run of investigations the sheriff
undertakes.
IT
The Court's reliance on "the ancient understanding of
what it has meant to be a sheriff," ante, at 795, is no more
persuasive than its interpretation of Alabama law. This emphasis on the historical understanding of the office of sheriff
implies, again, an all-state categorization of sheriffs throughout the Nation; but because the Court expressly disclaims
such a "blunderbuss" approach, ibid., that cannot be what

this history lesson is intended to convey. In England, it is
true, the sheriff did perform "the king's business in the
county." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *339. But the
English sheriff, as Blackstone described him, was far closer
to the crown than his contemporary counterpart is to the
central state government. While sheriffs were for a time
chosen locally, "[tihis election," according to Blackstone, "was
in all probability not absolutely vested in the [inhabitants of
the counties], but required the royal approbation." Id., at
*340. Eventually, the king chose the sheriff from a list proposed by the judges and other great officers. See id., at
*340-'*341.
Whatever English history may teach, "[t]hroughout U. S.
history, the sheriff has remained the principal law enforcement officer in the county." G. Felkenes, The Criminal Justice System: Its Functions and Personnel 53 (1973); see id.,
at 52-53 (referring specifically to Alabama sheriffs). In the
United States, "[i]n order to reserve control over the sheriff's department and its police functions, the people made the
sheriff an elective officer." Id., at 53. It is this status as
the county's law enforcement officer chosen by the county's
residents that is at the root of the contemporary understanding of the sheriff as a county officer.
A sheriff locally elected, paid, and equipped, who autonomously sets and implements law enforcement policies operative within the geographic confines of a county, is ordinarily
just what he seems to be: a county official. Nothing in Alabama law warrants a different conclusion. It makes scant
sense to treat sheriffs' activities differently based on the
presence or absence of state constitutional provisions of the
limited kind Alabama has adopted.
The Court's Alabama-specific approach, however, assures
that today's immediate holding is of limited reach. The
Court does not appear to question that an Alabama sheriff
may still be a county policymaker for some purposes, such

as hiring the county's chief jailor, see Parker v. Williams,
862 F. 2d 1471, 1477-1481 (CAll 1989). And, as the Court
acknowledges, under its approach sheriffs may be policymakers for certain purposes in some States and not in others.
See ante, at 795, and n. 10. The Court's opinion does not
call into question the numerous Court of Appeals decisions,
some of them decades old, ranking sheriffs as county, not
state, policymakers. Furthermore, the Court's recognition
of the historic reasons why Alabama listed sheriffs as members of the State's "executive department," see ante, at 788789, should discourage endeavors to insulate counties and
municipalities from Monell liability by change-the-label devices. Thus, the Court's opinion, while in my view misguided, does little to alter § 1983 county and municipal liability in most jurisdictions.
