APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
No. 91-1618.

Argued December 8, 1992-Decided March 2, 1993

Pursuant to the Ohio Constitution's requirement that electoral districts
for the state legislature be reapportioned every 10 years, appellant
James Tilling drafted and the state apportionment board adopted in
1991 an apportionment plan that created several districts in which a
majority of the population is a member of a specific minority group.
Appellees, Democratic board members who voted against the plan and
others, filed suit in the District Court, asking that the plan be invalidated on the grounds that it violated § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. A three-judge
District Court ordered the board to reconsider the plan, holding that § 2
of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the wholesale creation of majorityminority districts unless necessary to remedy a § 2 violation; the board,
it held, had failed to show such a violation. The District Court reaffirmed that holding when it reviewed the board's revised 1992 plan, rejecting appellants' argument that it should not have invalidated the 1991
plan without finding that, under the totality of the circumstances, the
plan diluted minority voting strength. In addition, the court held that
the board had violated the Fifteenth Amendment by applying the remedy of creating majority-minority districts intentionally and for the purpose of political advantage. It further held that the plan violated the
Fourteenth Amendment by departing from the requirement that all districts be of nearly equal population.
Held:
1. The plan does not violate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Pp. 152-158.
(a) Appellees raise an "influence-dilution" claim. They contend
that, by packing black voters in a few districts with a disproportionately
large black voter population, the plan deprived them of a larger number
of districts in which they would have been an influential minority capable of electing their candidates of choice with the help of cross-over
votes from white voters. While this Court has not decided whether
such a claim is viable under § 2, the Court assumes for the purpose of

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)

Syllabus
resolving this case that appellees have stated a cognizable §2 claim.
Pp. 152-154.
(b) Plaintiffs can prevail on a §2 dilution claim only if they show
that, under the totality of the circumstances, the State's apportionment
scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength
of the protected class. The District Court erred in holding that §2
prohibits the creation of majority-minority districts unless such districts are necessary to remedy a statutory violation, since §2 contains
no per se prohibitions against any particular type of district. Instead,
it focuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment. The court
also mistakenly placed the burden of justifying apportionment on Ohio
by requiring appellants to justify the creation of majority-minority districts. Section 2(b) places at least the initial burden of proving an
apportionment's invalidity on the plaintiff's shoulders. Although the
federal courts may not order the creation of majority-minority districts
unless necessary to remedy a violation of federal law, that prohibition
does not extend to the States. The federal courts are barred from intervening in state apportionment in the absence of such a violation precisely because it is the domain of the States and not the federal courts
to conduct apportionment in the first place. Pp. 154-157.
(c) The District Court, had it applied the three-part vote-dilution
test of Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51, would have rejected
appellees' §2 claim on the ground that appellees failed to demonstrate
Gingles' third precondition-sufficient white majority bloc voting to
frustrate the election of the minority group's candidate of choice. The
court specifically found, and appellees agree, that Ohio does not suffer
from racially polarized voting. Pp. 157-158.
2. The District Court's holding that the board violated the Fifteenth
Amendment by intentionally diluting minority voting strength for political reasons is clearly erroneous. Tilling's preference for federal over
state law when he believed the two in conflict does not raise an inference
of intentional discrimination; it demonstrates obedience to the Supremacy Clause. Nor does the fact that Tilling, a Republican, possessed
Democratic documents speculating about possible discriminatory strategies Tilling might use demonstrate that Tilling in fact had such a discriminatory strategy. Nothing in the record indicates that Tilling relied on those documents in preparing the plan. Indeed, the record
indicates that Tilling and the board relied on sources, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Ohio Conference of Branches, that were wholly unlikely to engage in or tolerate
intentional discrimination against black voters. This Court expresses
no view on the relationship between the Fifteenth Amendment and

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Syllabus
race-conscious redistricting; it concludes only that the finding of intentional discrimination was clear error. Pp. 158-160.
3. The District Court erred in holding that the plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment requirement that electoral districts be of nearly
equal population. When the court found that the maximum total deviation from ideal district size exceeded 10%, appellees established a prima
facie case of discrimination and appellants were required to justify the
deviation. They attempted to do so, arguing that the deviation resulted
from Ohio's constitutional policy in favor of preserving county boundaries. However, the District Court mistakenly held that total deviations in excess of 10% cannot be justified by a policy of preserving political subdivision boundaries. On remand, the court should consider
whether the deviations from ideal district size are justified using the
analysis employed in Brown v. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 843-846, and
Mahan v. Howell, 410 U. S. 315, 325-330, which requires the court to
determine whether the plan could reasonably be said to advance the
State's policy, and, if it could, whether the resulting population disparities exceed constitutional limits. Pp. 160-162.
Reversed and remanded.

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is yet another dispute arising out of legislative redistricting and reapportionment. See, e. g., Growe v. Emison,
ante, p. 25. Today we consider whether Ohio's creation of
several legislative districts dominated by minority voters
violated § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437,
as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR

.I
Under the Ohio Constitution, the state apportionment
board must reapportion electoral districts for the state legislature every 10 years. Ohio Const., Art. XI, § 1. In 1991,
the board selected James Tilling to draft a proposed apportionment plan. After conducting public hearings and meeting with members of historically underrepresented groups,
Tilling drafted a plan that included eight so-called majorityminority districts-districts in which a majority of the population is a member of a specific minority group. The board
adopted the plan with minor amendments by a 3-to-2 vote
along party lines. The board's three Republican members
voted for the plan; the two Democrats voted against it. 794
F. Supp. 695, 698, 716-717 (ND Ohio 1992); App. to Juris.
Statement 160a-167a, 183a.
Appellees Barney Quilter and Thomas Ferguson, the two
Democratic members of the board who voted against the
plan, and various Democratic electors and legislators filed
this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio seeking the plan's invalidation.
They alleged that the plan violated § 2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973, and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 794 F. Supp., at 695-696. According to appellees,
the plan "packed" black voters by creating districts in which
they would constitute a disproportionately large majority.
This, appellees contended, minimized the total number of districts in which black voters could select their candidate of

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

choice. In appellees' view, the plan should have created a
larger number of "influence" districts-districts in which
black voters would not constitute a majority but in which
they could, with the help of a predictable number of crossover votes from white voters, elect their candidates of choice.
See App. to Juris. Statement 141a-142a. Appellants, by
contrast, argued that the plan actually enhanced the
strength of black voters by providing "safe" minoritydominated districts. The plan, they pointed out, compared
favorably with the 1981 apportionment and had the backing
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, Ohio Conference of Branches (Ohio NAACP). 794
F. Supp., at 706.
A three-judge District Court heard the case and held for
appellees. Relying on various statements Tilling had made
in the course of the reapportionment hearings, the court
found that the board had created minority-dominated districts "whenever possible." Id., at 698. The District Court
rejected appellants' contention that §2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973, requires that such
districts be created wherever possible. 794 F. Supp., at 699.
It further held that §2 actually prohibits the "wholesale
creation of majority-minority districts" unless necessary to
"'remedy"' a § 2 violation. Id., at 701. The District Court
therefore ordered the board to draft a new plan or demonstrate that it was remedying a § 2 violation. Id., at 702.
Judge Dowd dissented, arguing that the majority's analysis "place[d] the cart before the horse." Id., at 709. In his
view, § 2 does not require the State to show a violation before
creating a majority-minority district. Rather, the State
may create any district it might desire, so long as minority
voting strength is not diluted as a result. Because appellees
failed to demonstrate that the 1991 plan diluted the balloting
strength of black voters, Judge Dowd thought their challenge should fail. Id., at 710.

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)

Opinion of the Court

The apportionment board responded by creating a record
that, in its view, justified the creation of majority-minority
districts. The board also adjusted the plan to correct "technical" errors that the Ohio Supreme Court had identified in
its independent review of the plan. This revised 1992 plan
created only five majority-black districts. App. to Juris.
Statement 258a-263a. The District Court, however, was
not satisfied with the board's proof. In an order issued on
March 10, 1992, it held that "the [b]oard fail[ed] once again
to justify its wholesale creation of majority-minority districts, thus rendering the plan, as submitted, violative of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965." 794 F. Supp. 756, 757 (ND
Ohio). The court then appointed a special master to prepare
a redistricting plan. Ibid. Once again, Judge Dowd dissented. Id., at 758.
Nine days later, on March 19, 1992, the District Court
issued an order reaffirming its view that the creation of
majority-minority districts is impermissible under §2 unless
necessary to remedy a statutory violation. App. to Juris.
Statement 128a-141a. The order also restated the court's
conclusion that the board had failed to prove a violation.
Specifically, it noted "the absence of racial bloc voting, the
[ability of black voters] to elect both black and white candidates of their choice, and the fact that such candidates ha[d]
been elected over a sustained period of time." Id., at 130a.
In addition, the order rejected as "clever sophistry" appellants' argument that the District Court should not have invalidated the 1991 plan without finding that, under the totality of the circumstances, it diluted minority voting strength:
"Having implemented the Voting Rights Act remedy in
the absence of a violation, [appellants] suggest that we
are now required to establish a violation as a prerequisite to removing the remedy. Actually, however, this
task is not as difficult as it seems.

The totality of cir-

cumstances reveals coalitional voting between whites
and blacks. As a result, black candidates have been re-

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

peatedly elected from districts with only a 35% black
population. Against this background, the per se requirement of the creation of majority-minority districts
has a dilutive effect on black votes .... ." Id., at 141a,
142a (footnotes omitted).
The District Court further concluded that, because the board
had applied the "'remedy' intentionally" and for the purpose
of political advantage, it had violated not only §2 but the
Fifteenth Amendment as well. Id., at 142a-143a. Finally,
the court held that the plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it departed from the requirement that all districts be of nearly equal population. Id., at 146a-148a.
On March 31, 1992, the District Court ordered that the
primary elections for Ohio's General Assembly be rescheduled. 794 F. Supp. 760 (ND Ohio). On April 20, 1992, this
Court granted appellants' application for a stay of the District Court's orders, 503 U. S. 979; and on June 1, 1992, we
noted probable jurisdiction, 504 U. S. 954. We now reverse
the judgment of the District Court and remand only for
further proceedings on whether the plan's deviation from
equal population among districts violates the Fourteenth
Amendment.
II
Congress enacted §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42
U. S. C. § 1973, to help effectuate the Fifteenth Amendment's
guarantee that no citizen's right to vote shall "be denied or
abridged ... on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude," U. S. Const., Amdt. 15. See NAACP v. New
York, 413 U. S. 345, 350 (1973). Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits the imposition of any electoral practice or procedure
that "results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any
citizen.., to vote on account of race or color." Section 2(b),
in relevant part, specifies that § 2(a) is violated if:
"[B]ased on the totality of circumstances, it is shown
that the political processes leading to nomination or elec-

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)
Opinion of the Court

tion in the State or political subdivision are not equally
open to participation by members of a class of citizens
protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its
members have less opportunity than other members of
the electorate to participate in the political process and
to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.
§ 1973(b).
Section 2 thus prohibits any practice or procedure that, "interact[ing] with social and historical conditions," impairs the
ability of a protected class to elect its candidate of choice on
an equal basis with other voters. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478
U. S. 30, 47 (1986).
A
In the context of single-member districts, the usual device
for diluting minority voting power is the manipulation of district lines. A politically cohesive minority group that is
large enough to constitute the majority in a single-member
district has a good chance of electing its candidate of choice,
if the group is placed in a district where it constitutes a majority. Dividing the minority group among various districts
so that it is a majority in none may prevent the group from
electing its candidate of choice: If the majority in each district votes as a bloc against the minority candidate, the fragmented minority group will be unable to muster sufficient
votes in any district to carry its candidate to victory.
This case focuses not on the fragmentation of a minority
group among various districts but on the concentration of
minority voters within a district. How such concentration
or "packing" may dilute minority voting strength is not
difficult to conceptualize. A minority group, for example,
might have sufficient numbers to constitute a majority in
three districts. So apportioned, the group inevitably will
elect three candidates of its choice, assuming the group is
sufficiently cohesive. But if the group is packed into two
districts in which it constitutes a super-majority, it will be

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

assured only two candidates. As a result, we have recognized that "[d]ilution of racial minority group voting
strength may be caused" either "by the dispersal of blacks
into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority
of voters or from the concentration of blacks into districts
where they constitute an excessive majority." Id., at 46,
n. 11.
Appellees in this case, however, do not allege that Ohio's
creation of majority-black districts prevented black voters
from constituting a majority in additional districts. Instead, they claim that Ohio's plan deprived them of "influence
districts" in which they would have constituted an influential
minority. Black voters in such influence districts, of course,
could not dictate electoral outcomes independently. But
they could elect their candidate of choice nonetheless if they
are numerous enough and their candidate attracts sufficient
cross-over votes from white voters. We have not yet decided whether influence-dilution claims such as appellees' are
viable under § 2, Growe, ante, at 41, n. 5; see Gingles, supra,
at 46-47, nn. 11-12 (leaving open the possibility of influencedilution claims); nor do we decide that question today. Instead, we assume for the purpose of resolving this case that
appellees in fact have stated a cognizable § 2 claim.
B
The practice challenged here, the creation of majorityminority districts, does not invariably minimize or maximize
minority voting strength. Instead, it can have either effect
or neither. On the one hand, creating majority-black districts necessarily leaves fewer black voters and therefore
diminishes black-voter influence in predominantly white districts. On the other hand, the creation of majority-black
districts can enhance the influence of black voters. Placing
black voters in a district in which they constitute a sizeable
and therefore "safe" majority ensures that they are able to
elect their candidate of choice. Which effect the practice

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)
Opinion of the Court

has, if any at all, depends entirely on the facts and circumstances of each case.
The District Court, however, initially thought it unnecessary to determine the effect of creating majority-black districts under the totality of the circumstances. In fact, the
court did not believe it necessary to find vote dilution at all.
It instead held that §2 prohibits the creation of majorityminority districts unless such districts are necessary to
remedy a statutory violation. 794 F. Supp., at 701. We
disagree. Section 2 contains no per se prohibitions against
particular types of districts: It says nothing about majorityminority districts, districts dominated by certain political
parties, or even districts based entirely on partisan political concerns. Instead, §2 focuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment. Only if the apportionment
scheme has the effect of denying a protected class the equal
opportunity to elect its candidate of choice does it violate § 2;
where such an effect has not been demonstrated, § 2 simply
does not speak to the matter. See 42 U. S. C. § 1973(b). Indeed, in Gingles we expressly so held: "[E]lectoral devices
•.. may not be considered per se violative of § 2. Plaintiffs
must demonstrate that, under the totality of the circumstances, the devices result in unequal access to the electoral
process." 478 U. S., at 46. As a result, the District Court
was required to determine the consequences of Ohio's apportionment plan before ruling on its validity; the failure to do
so was error.
The District Court's decision was flawed for another
reason as well. By requiring appellants to justify the
creation of majority-minority districts, the District Court
placed the burden of justifying apportionment on the State.
Section 2, however, places at least the initial burden of
proving an apportionment's invalidity squarely on the plaintiff's shoulders. Section 2(b) specifies that § 2(a) is violated
if "it is shown" that a state practice has the effect of
denying a protected group equal access to the electoral proc-

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

ess. 42 U. S. C. § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The burden of
"show[ing]" the prohibited effect, of course, is on the plaintiff; surely Congress could not have intended the State to
prove the invalidity of its own apportionment scheme. See
Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46 (plaintiffs must demonstrate that the
device results in unequal access to the electoral process); id.,
at 49, n. 15 (plaintiffs must "prove their claim before they
may be awarded relief"). The District Court relieved appellees of that burden in this case solely because the State had
created majority-minority districts. Because that departure from the statutorily required allocation of burdens finds
no support in the statute, it was error for the District Court
to impose it.
Of course, the federal courts may not order the creation of
majority-minority districts unless necessary to remedy a violation of federal law. See Growe, ante, at 40-41. But that
does not mean that the State's powers are similarly limited.
Quite the opposite is true: Federal courts are barred from
intervening in state apportionment in the absence of a violation of federal law precisely because it is the domain of the
States, and not the federal courts, to conduct apportionment
in the first place. Time and again we have emphasized that
"'reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility
of the State through its legislature or other body, rather than
of a federal court."' Growe, ante, at 34 (quoting Chapman
v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975)). Accord, Connor v. Finch,
431 U. S. 407, 414 (1977) ("We have repeatedly emphasized
that 'legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for
legislative consideration and determination"' (quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 586 (1964))). Because the
"States do not derive their reapportionment authority from
the Voting Rights Act, but rather from independent provisions of state and federal law," Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 12, the federal courts are bound to respect
the States' apportionment choices unless those choices contravene federal requirements. Cf. Katzenbach v. Morgan,

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)
Opinion of the Court

384 U. S. 641, 647-648 (1966) ("Under the distribution of
powers effected by the Constitution, the States establish
qualifications for voting for state officers" and such qualifications are valid unless they violate the Constitution or a
federal statute).
Appellees' complaint does not allege that the State's conscious use of race in redistricting violates the Equal Protection Clause; the District Court below did not address the
issue; and neither party raises it here. Accordingly, we express no view on how such a claim might be evaluated. We
hold only that, under §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973, plaintiffs can prevail on a dilution claim only if they show that, under the totality of the
circumstances, the State's apportionment scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength of the
protected class.
C
In its order of March 19, 1992, the District Court found
that the 1992 plan's creation of majority-minority districts
"ha[d] a dilutive effect on black votes." App. to Juris. Statement 141a. Again we disagree.
In Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, this Court held that plaintiffs claiming vote dilution through the use of multimember
districts must prove three threshold conditions. First, they
must show that the minority group "'is sufficiently large and
geographically compact to constitute a majority in a singlemember district."' Second, they must prove that the minority group "'is politically cohesive."' Third, the plaintiffs
must establish "'that the white majority votes sufficiently as
a bloc to enable it ...

usually to defeat the minority's pre-

ferred candidate."' Growe, ante, at 40 (quoting Gingles,
supra, at 50-51). The District Court apparently thought
the three Gingles factors inapplicable because Ohio has
single-member rather than multimember districts. 794 F.
Supp., at 699 ("Gingles' preconditions are not applicable to
the apportionment of single-member districts"). In Growe,

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

however, we held that the Gingles preconditions apply in
challenges to single-member as well as multimember districts. Ante, at 40-41.
Had the District Court employed the Gingles test in this
case, it would have rejected appellees' § 2 claim. Of course,
the Gingles factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim. For example, the first
Gingles precondition, the requirement that the group be sufficiently large to constitute a majority in a single district,
would have to be modified or eliminated when analyzing the
influence-dilution claim we assume, arguendo, to be actionable today. Supra, at 154. The complaint in such a case is
not that black voters have been deprived of the ability to
constitute a majority, but of the possibility of being a sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate of choice with
the assistance of cross-over votes from the white majority.
See ibid. We need not decide how Gingles' first factor
might apply here, however, because appellees have failed
to demonstrate Gingles' third precondition-sufficient white
majority bloc voting to frustrate the election of the minority
group's candidate of choice. The District Court specifically
found that Ohio does not suffer from "racially polarized
voting." 794 F. Supp., at 700-701. Accord, App. to Juris.
Statement 132a-134a, and n. 2, 139a-140a. Even appellees
agree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. Here, as in Gingles, "in the
absence of significant white bloc voting it cannot be said that
the ability of minority voters to elect their chosen representatives is inferior to that of white voters." Gingles, 478
U. S., at 49, n. 15. The District Court's finding of a §2 violation, therefore, must be reversed.
III
The District Court also held that the redistricting plan
violated the Fifteenth Amendment because the apportionment board intentionally diluted minority voting strength
for political reasons. App. to Juris. Statement 142a-143a.

Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)

Opinion of the Court

This Court has not decided whether the Fifteenth Amendment applies to vote-dilution claims; in fact, we never have
held any legislative apportionment inconsistent with the Fifteenth Amendment. Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130,
142-143, n. 14 (1976). Nonetheless, we need not decide the
precise scope of the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition in
this case. Even if we assume that the Fifteenth Amendment speaks to claims like appellees', the District Court's
decision still must be reversed: Its finding of intentional discrimination was clearly erroneous. See Mobile v. Bolden,
446 U. S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion); id., at 101-103
(WHITE, J., dissenting); id., at 90-92 (STEVENS, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 80 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in result).
The District Court cited only two pieces of evidence to
support its finding. First, the District Court thought it significant that the plan's drafter, Tilling, disregarded the requirements of the Ohio Constitution where he believed that
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required a contrary result.
App. to Juris. Statement 142a-143a, n. 8. But Tilling's preference for federal over state law when he believed the two
in conflict does not raise an inference of intentional discrimination; it demonstrates obedience to the Supremacy Clause
of the United States Constitution. Second, the District
Court cited Tilling's possession of certain documents that,
according to the court, were tantamount to "a road-map detailing how [one could] create a racial gerrymander." Id.,
at 143a, n. 9. Apparently, the District Court believed that
Tilling, a Republican, sought to minimize the Democratic
Party's power by diluting minority voting strength. See
ibid. The District Court, however, failed to explain the nature of the documents. Contrary to the implication of the
District Court opinion, the documents were not a set of
Republican plans for diluting minority voting strength. In
fact, they were not even created by Tilling or the Republicans. They were created by a Democrat who, concerned
about possible Republican manipulation of apportionment,

VOINOVICH v. QUILTER
Opinion of the Court

set out the various types of political gerrymandering in
which he thought the Republicans might engage. App. 99100. That Tilling possessed documents in which the opposing party speculated that he might have a discriminatory
strategy does not indicate that Tilling actually had such a
strategy. And nothing in the record indicates that Tilling
relied on the documents in preparing the plan.
Indeed, the record demonstrates that Tilling and the board
relied on sources that were wholly unlikely to engage in or
tolerate intentional discrimination against black voters,
including the Ohio NAACP, the Black Elected Democrats
of Ohio, and the Black Elected Democrats of Cleveland,
Ohio. Tilling's plan actually incorporated much of the Ohio
NAACP's proposed plan; the Ohio NAACP, for its part, fully
supported the 1991 apportionment plan. 794 F. Supp., at
726-729; App. to Juris. Statement 164a-167a, 269a-270a.
Because the evidence not only fails to support but also directly contradicts the District Court's finding of discriminatory intent, we reverse that finding as clearly erroneous. In
so doing, we express no view on the relationship between
the Fifteenth Amendment and race-conscious redistricting.
Cf. United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v.
Carey, 430 U. S. 144,155-165 (1977) (plurality opinion). Neither party asserts that the State's conscious use of race by
itself violates the Fifteenth Amendment. Instead, they dispute whether the District Court properly found that the
State intentionally discriminated against black voters. On
that question, we hold only that the District Court's finding
of discriminatory intent was clear error.

Finally, the District Court held that the plan violated
the Fourteenth Amendment because it created legislative
districts of unequal size. App. to Juris. Statement 146a148a. The Equal Protection Clause does require that electoral districts be "of nearly equal population, so that each

Opinion of the Court

person's vote may be given equal weight in the election of
representatives." Connor, 431 U. S., at 416. But the requirement is not an inflexible one.
"[M]inor deviations from mathematical equality among
state legislative districts are insufficient to make out a
prima facie case of invidious discrimination under the
Fourteenth Amendment so as to require justification by
the State. Our decisions have established, as a general
matter, that an apportionment plan with a maximum
population deviation under 10% falls within this category of minor deviations. A plan with larger disparities
in population, however, creates a prima facie case of
discrimination and therefore must be justified by
the State." Brown v. Thomson, 462 U. S.835, 842-843
(1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Here, the District Court found that the maximum total deviation from ideal district size exceeded 10%. App. to Juris.
Statement 148a. As a result, appellees established a prima
facie case of discrimination, and appellants were required to
justify the deviation. Appellants attempted to do just that,
arguing that the deviation resulted from the State's constitutional policy in favor of preserving county boundaries. See
Ohio Const., Arts. VII-XI. The District Court therefore
was required to decide whether the "plan 'may reasonably
be said to advance [the] rational state policy"' of preserving
county boundaries "and, if so, 'whether the population disparities among the districts that have resulted from the
pursuit of th[e] plan exceed constitutional limits."' Brown,
supra, at 843 (quoting Mahan v. Howell, 410 U. S.315, 328
(1973)). Rather than undertaking that inquiry, the District
Court simply held that total deviations in excess of 10% cannot be justified by a policy of preserving the boundaries of
political subdivisions. Our case law is directly to the contrary. See Mahan v. Howell, supra (upholding total deviation of over 16% where justified by the rational objective of

Opinion of the Court

preserving the integrity of political subdivision lines); see
also Brown v. Thomson, supra. On remand, the District
Court should consider whether the deviations from the ideal
district size are justified using the analysis employed in
Brown, supra, at 843-846, and Mahan, supra, at 325-330.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with
this opinion.
So ordered.
