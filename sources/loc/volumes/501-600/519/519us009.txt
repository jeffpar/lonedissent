LOPEZ ET AL. v. MONTEREY COUNTY,
CALIFORNIA, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
No. 95-1201.

Argued October 8, 1996-Decided November 6, 1996

As a jurisdiction covered by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, appellee
Monterey County (hereinafter County) must obtain federal preclearance-either from the Attorney General of the United States or from
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia--of any
voting practice different from its practices on November 1, 1968. On
that date, the County had nine separate and independent inferior court
districts, the judges of which were elected exclusively by their respective districts' voters. Between 1972 and 1983, the County adopted
six ordinances, which ultimately merged all the districts into a single,
countywide municipal court served by judges whom County residents
elected at large. This consolidation took place against a backdrop of
California laws, some of which governed courts generally and others of
which applied to the County's courts specifically. In 1991, appellants,
Hispanic voters residing in the County, sued in the District Court, alleging that the County had violated §5 by failing to obtain federal preclearance of the consolidation ordinances. The three-judge District Court
ordered the County to obtain federal preclearance of the challenged ordinances. But the County did not submit the ordinances to the appropriate federal authorities. Instead, the County began to work with appellants to develop a new judicial election plan that they believed would
be less retrogressive than the at-large, countywide election scheme.
The State of California, as intervenor, opposed the parties' proposed
plans. Ultimately, the District Court ordered the County to conduct
judicial elections under an at-large, countywide election plan. In essence, four years after the filing of the complaint, the District Court
ordered the County to hold elections under the very same scheme that
appellants had originally challenged under §5 as unprecleared.
Held:
1. This Court leaves to the District Court to resolve on remand appellee State's threshold contentions that, although the County perhaps
should have submitted the consolidation ordinances for federal preclearance before implementing them, intervening changes in California law
have transformed the County's judicial election scheme into a state plan,
for which § 5 preclearance is not needed; that appellants' suit was barred

by laches; that it is constitutionally improper to designate the County a
covered jurisdiction under § 5; and that the consolidation ordinances did
not alter a voting "standard, practice, or procedure" subject to § 5 preclearance. Pp. 19-20.
2. The District Court's order that the County conduct elections under
its unprecleared, at-large judicial election plan conflicts with Clark v.
Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652-653, in which the Court held, among other
things, that a voting change subject to § 5 is unenforceable unless precleared and that § 5 plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction prohibiting
implementation of an unprecleared change. Thus, an injunction is required where, as here, a district court must decide whether to allow
illegal elections to go forward. Id., at 654. There is no "extreme circumstance" here that might justify allowing the 1996 elections to proceed, cf. id., at 654-655, and the District Court has not independently
crafted a remedial electoral plan such as might render the preclearance
requirements inapplicable, see McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130, 148150. Nor is the preclearance process' basic nature changed by the complicating factors that a simple injunction could leave the County without
a judicial election system because a return to the 1968 plan appears
impractical, and that the parties seem unable to fashion a plan that does
not contravene California law. Congress gave exclusive authority to
pass on an election change's discriminatory effect or purpose to the federal authorities designated in § 5. See id., at 151. On a complaint alleging failure to preclear election changes under §5, a three-judge district court may determine only whether §5 covers a contested change,
whether §5's approval requirements were satisfied, and if the requirements were not satisfied, what temporary remedy, if any, is appropriate.
See City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 129, n. 3. The goal
of a three-judge district court facing a § 5 challenge must be to ensure
that the covered jurisdiction submits its election plan to the appropriate
federal authorities for preclearance as expeditiously as possible. Here,
by protracting this litigation in order to obtain a plan that complied
both with § 5 and with state law, the District Court interposed itself
into the §5 approval process in a way that the statute does not contemplate. Cf, e.g., Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37, 42-43 (per curiam).

JUSTICE O'CONNOR

I
The State of California has 58 counties, one of which is
Monterey County (hereinafter County). In 1971, the Attorney General designated the County a covered jurisdiction
under § 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 438,
as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973b(b). 36 Fed. Reg. 5809 (1971);
see 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (1995). As a result, the County
became subject to the federal preclearance requirements set
forth in § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. § 1973c.

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

Section 5 governs changes in voting procedures, with the
purpose of preventing jurisdictions covered by its requirements from enacting or seeking to administer voting changes
that have a discriminatory purpose or effect. As a jurisdiction covered by § 5, Monterey County must obtain federal
preclearance-either administrative or judicial-of any voting practice different from the practices in effect on November 1, 1968. To obtain administrative preclearance of a
changed voting practice, a covered jurisdiction submits the
enactment to the Attorney General of the United States. If
the Attorney General does not formally object to the new
procedure within 60 days of submission, the jurisdiction may
enforce the legislation. A coveye jurisdiction may also
obtain judicial preclearance-,either directly .or after the
Attorney General has objected to the voting change-by
securing in the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia a declaratory judgment that the new practice
"does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of
denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race
or color . . ." Ibid.
On November 1, 1968, the County had nine inferior court
districts. Two of these districts were municipal court districts, each served by two judges, and the other seven were
justice court districts, each served by a single judge. Both
municipal and justice courts were trial courts of limited
jurisdiction. Municipal courts served districts with populations exceeding 40,000, and justice courts served those districts with smaller populations. The justice courts differed
from the municipal courts in other respects. They were not
courts of record and were served by judges who often
worked part time and did not have to be members of the bar.
Comment, Trial Court Consolidation in California, 21 UCLA
L. Rev. 1081, 1086 (1974). (On January 1, 1990, however,
a state constitutional am6ndment specified that all courts,
including justice courts, were courts of record. Cal. Const.,

Cite as: 519 U. S. 9 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Art. VI, § 1 (1988). A few years later, California voters
eliminated justice courts altogether. Art. VI, §§ 1, 5(b).)
Each of the municipal and justice courts operated separately and independently. Judges for each court were
elected at large by the voters of their respective districts,
and they served only the judicial district in which they were
elected. The municipal and justice court districts varied
widely in population and judicial workloads. For example,
a 1972 survey showed that the Monterey-Carmel Municipal
Court District had a population of 106,700, with more than
enough work for two full-time judges. By contrast, the San
Ardo Justice Court District had a population of 3,500, with a
caseload that required less than a quarter of one judge's time.
Between 1972 and 1983, the County adopted six ordinances, which ultimately merged the seven justice court
districts and the two municipal court districts into a single,
countywide municipal court, served by nine judges whom
County residents elected at large. (At present, 10 judges
serve on the municipal court.) Each judge was elected to
serve for a term of six years. Judicial elections were conducted under various interim schemes in 1974, 1976, 1978,
and 1982. Additionally, the County conducted at-large,
countywide judicial elections in 1986, 1988, and 1990.
The County's reorganization of its inferior court system
took place against a backdrop of state laws governing the
general administration and organization of state courts.
State law authorizes a county board of supervisors, "[a]s public convenience requires,... [to] divide the county into judicial districts for the purpose of electing judges . . . -." Cal.
Govt. Code Ann. § 71040 (West 1976). The board also "may
change district boundaries and create other districts."
Ibid.; see also Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §25200 (West 1988)
("The board of supervisors may divide the county into election ... and other districts required by law, change their
boundaries, and create other districts, as convenience re-

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

quires"). A county's judicial election scheme must comply
with several state constitutional and statutory requirements.
Municipal court districts must include at least 40,000 residents, Cal. Const., Art. VI, § 5(a); cities may not be split into
more than one judicial district, ibid.; Cal. Govt. Code Ann.
§ 71040 (West 1976); municipal court judges must be residents of the judicial district to which they are elected or
appointed, § 71140; and, according to the State, judges' jurisdictional and electoral bases must be coextensive, Cal.
Const., Art. VI, § 16(b); Koski v. James, 47 Cal. App. 3d 349,
354, 120 Cal. Rptr. 754, 758 (1975).
In addition to these generally applicable laws, the state
legislature has enacted various pieces of legislation directed
at the judicial systems of particular California counties, including laws aimed specifically at Monterey County's judicial
system. Cal. Govt. Code Ann., Tit. 8, ch. 10 (West 1993).
Some of these laws have reflected changes in the County's
judicial districts resulting from the consolidation process.*
The State has also enacted legislation dealing with the administration of the County's judicial system, such as appoint*See, e. g., 1953 Cal. Stats., ch. 206, §2 ("This article applies to the municipal court established in a district embracing the Cities of Carmel and
Monterey"); 1975 Cal. Stats., ch. 966, §2 ("This article applies only to municipal courts established in... [a] district embracing the Cities of Monterey, Carmel, Seaside, Sand City, and Del Rey Oaks designated as the
Monterey-Carmel Judicial District; [and a] district embracing the City of
Salinas designated as the Salinas Judicial District"); 1977 Cal. Stats., ch.
995, § 1 ("This article applies to all of the municipal courts established in
the County of Monterey, which are in judicial districts entitled as follows:
the Monterey Peninsula Judicial District, the Salinas Judicial District, and
the North Monterey County Judicial District"); 1979 Cal. Stats., ch. 694,
§ 2 ("There is in the County of Monterey, on and after the effective date
of this section, a single municipal court district which embraces the former
Salinas Judicial District, Monterey Peninsula Judicial District and North
Monterey County Judicial District"); 1989 Cal. Stats., ch. 608, § 1 (codified
at Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §73560 (West 1993)) ("This article applies to the
Monterey County Municipal Court District, which encompasses the entire
County of Monterey").

ment and compensation of court personnel. Cal. Govt. Code
Ann. §§ 73564-73569 (West 1993).
Although it was subject to § 5 preclearance requirements,
the County did not submit any of the consolidation ordinances for federal preclearance under §5. The State, however, in 1983 submitted for administrative preclearance a
state law, 1983 Cal. Stats., ch. 1249, that mentioned Monterey
County's prospective consolidation of the last two justice
court districts with the remaining municipal court district.
The Department of Justice requested additional information
concerning this aspect of the state legislation. In its response, the State included the last of the County's six consolidation ordinances, which was adopted in 1983. The Attorney General interposed no objection to the 1983 state law.
The State's submission may Well have served to preclear the
1983 county ordinance. See 28 CFR § 51.14(2) (1981); 28
CFR § 51.15(a) (1987). The United States points out, however, that the 1983 submission to the Department of Justice
did not identify or describe any of the County's previous consolidation ordinances. The State does not contest this point.
Thus, under our precedent, these previous consolidation ordinances do not appear to have received federal preclearance
approval. Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 657-658 (1991);
McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, 249 (1984).
On September 6, 1991, appellants, five Hispanic voters residing in the County, sued the County in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the County had violated § 5 by failing to obtain
federal preclearance of the six judicial district consolidation
ordinances it had adopted between 1972 and 1983. They
raised no claim under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act or constitutional challenge. A three-judge District Court was convened. On March 31, 1993, the District Court ruled that the
challenged ordinances were election changes subject to § 5
and consequently unenforceable without federal preclearance. The District Court directed the County to submit the

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY

Opinion of the Court

ordinances to federal officials for preclearance. It also denied the County's motion to join the State as an indispensable party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b), finding that the State had no legally protected interest in the
outcome of the action.
In August 1993, the County filed a declaratory judgment
action in the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia, seeking judicial preclearance of the challenged
ordinances. Appellants intervened. But before that court
made any findings, the County voluntarily dismissed its action, without prejudice. The County and appellants subsequently stipulated that the County was "'unable to establish
that the [consolidation ordinances] adopted by the County
between 1968 and 1983 did not have the effect of denying
the right to vote to Latinos in Monterey County due to the
retrogressive effect several of these ordinances had on Latino voting strength .... "' 871 F. Supp. 1254, 1256 (N. D.
Cal. 1994). The parties thereupon returned to the threejudge District Court, and several years of litigation ensued.
In essence, the County and appellants ceased to litigate
the case as adversaries. Instead, they embarked on a joint
attempt, opposed by the State and others as intervenors, to
persuade the District Court to order a judicial election plan
they viewed as less retrogressive than an at-large, countywide election scheme. In late 1993 and early 1994, the
County and appellants jointly proposed two plans to the District Court. Each plan divided the County into different
election areas, with judges from each area to serve on the
countywide municipal court. The State objected to these
schemes on the ground that they contravened California law,
including the constitutional requirements that a judge's jurisdictional and electoral bases be coextensive, Cal. Const.,
Art. VI, § 16(b), and that cities not be split into more than
one judicial district, Art. VI, § 5(a). Appellants and the
County acknowledged these conflicts, but asked the District

Cite as: 519 U. S. 9 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Court to suspend operation of these state constitutional provisions in the County.
For some time, the District Court.was reluctant to implement either of the proposed plans, ruling that it was "not
satisfied that a plan necessarily ha[s] to conflict with [Article
VI, § 16(b) in order to meet the requirements of] the Voting
Rights Act." 871 F. Supp., at 1256. Finally, the County
and appellants filed with the District Court a stipulation that
the County could not "'devise or prepare any plan for the
election of municipal court judges in Monterey County that
[did] not conflict with at least one state law and still compl[ied] with the Voting Rights Act."' Id., at 1257. The parties supported the stipulation with information on County
demographics, the presence of politically cohesive Hispanic
communities and Anglo bloc voting, and a legacy of discrimination that had affected Hispanic citizens' right to vote.
They also set forth a number of potential election plans that
they believed complied with § 5, all of which violated some
aspect of state law.
In June 1994, the District Court decided to give appellants,
the County, the State, and the United States, which had
at this point weighed in as amicus curiae, another chance
to develop a workable solution. It enjoined the upcoming
1994 elections. It directed the County to attempt to obtain
changes in state law that would permit the implementation
of a judicial election plan that complied with §5 requirements. It asked the State to assist the County in creating an acceptable judicial election plan. Nevertheless, in
late 1994, the parties were back in court, still without a satisfactory plan. The County had sought amendments to the
State Constitution and statutes, but was unsuccessful.
In a December 20, 1994, order, the District Court concluded that it had to devise a remedy that would permit
judicial elections to take place, pending implementation of
a permanent, federally precleared voting plan. Otherwise,
voters would be deprived of their right to elect judges. The

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY

Opinion of the Court

District Court recognized that neither appellants nor the
County thought feasible a return to the election scheme in
effect on November 1, 1968. Instead, it decided to adopt
one of the plans the County and appellants previously had
proposed. Under this scheme, the County was divided into
four election districts. Voters in three of the districts, in
which Hispanics constituted a majority, would each elect one
judge. Voters in the fourth district would elect the other
seven judges. Judges elected under the plan would serve
for 18-month terms, until January 1997. All 10 judges
would serve on the countywide municipal court. The District Court acknowledged that the interim plan was inconsistent with state law, but reasoned that the intrusion on
state interests was minimal. The County submitted the interim plan to the Attorney General for preclearance, and it
was precleared on March 6, 1995. In a special election conducted on June 6, 1995, seven judges were elected. (Apparently, terms of three of the judges holding seats in the
seven-member election district had not expired by June
1995.)
Shortly after the June 1995 special election, this Court issued its decision in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995),
which prompted the three-judge District Court to reconsider
the soundness of its interim election plan. Miller,ruled the
District Court, cast "substantial doubt" on the constitutionality of its previous order, "as that plan used race as a
significant factor in dividing the County into election
areas." App. 167. Without ruling that the interim plan
was in fact unconstitutional, the District Court decided to
change course. It denied the County's request to extend the
terms of judges elected in the 1995 special election, concerned that such an extension would be "inappropriate" in
light of the possible constitutional infirmity of the interim
plan. A return to the judicial election system in existence
before the adoption of the consolidation ordinances was not
"legal, feasible or desired." Ibid. In the District Court's

Cite as: 519 U. S. 9 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

view, its only option was to order the County to conduct an
at-large, countywide judicial election in March 1996, while
enjoining future elections pending preclearance of a permanent plan. Judges elected in 1996 would serve for the usual
6-year terms. The District Court also joined the State as
an indispensable party, based on the State's argument that
the County was doing nothing more than administering a
state statute that required countywide elections, rather than
administering its own county ordinance. Thus, in essence,
four years after the filing of the complaint in this case, the
District Court ordered the County to hold elections under
the very same scheme that appellants originally challenged
under §5 as unprecleared.
On January 22, 1996, appellants filed an emergency application in this Court to enjoin the 1996 elections pending appeal. We granted the application on February 1, 516 U. S.
1104 (1996), and noted probable jurisdiction on April 1, 517
U. S. 1118 (1996).
II
A
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act applies whenever a covered jurisdiction "enact[s] or seek[s] to administer any ...
standard, practice, or procedure" different from that in force
on the date of § 5 coverage. As a threshold matter, the State
contends that, although the County perhaps should have submitted the consolidation ordinances to federal authorities before implementing them, intervening changes in California
law have transformed the County's judicial election scheme
into a state plan. Therefore, asserts the State, the County
is not administering County consolidation ordinances in conducting municipal court elections, but is merely implementing California law, for which § 5 preclearance is not needed.
The District Court was "not persuaded" by this argument,
but ruled that the State could continue to seek to show that
the County was merely administering California law. See

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY

Opinion of the Court

Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §71040 (West 1976); see also Cal. Govt.
Code Ann. § 25200 (West 1988). We leave this issue about
the scope of § 5 to the District Court to resolve on remand.
The State raises other threshold issues that the District
Court did not have the opportunity to address. The State
contends that appellants' suit was barred by laches; that it is
constitutionally improper to designate the County a covered
jurisdiction under §5; and that the consolidation ordinances
did not alter a voting "standard, practice, or procedure" subject to § 5 preclearance. We express no view on these
claims, leaving it to the District Court to decide them in the
first instance.
B
A jurisdiction subject to § 5's requirements must obtain
either judicial or administrative preclearance before implementing a voting change. No new voting practice is
enforceable unless the covered jurisdiction has succeeded
in obtaining preclearance. Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S., at
652-653; McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130, 137 (1981); Connor v. Waller, 421 U. S. 656 (1975) (per curiam). If a voting change subject to § 5 has not been precleared, § 5 plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction prohibiting implementation
of the change. Clark v. Roemer, supra, at 652-653 (citing
Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 572 (1969)).
The District Court's order that the County conduct elections
under the unprecleared, at-large judicial election plan conflicts with these principles and with our decision in Clark v.
Roemer, supra.
Clark concerned the propriety of a three-judge District
Court's refusal to enjoin elections under an unprecleared
Louisiana judicial election plan. There, Louisiana had not
submitted for preclearance a number of statutory and constitutional voting changes relating to elections of state judges,
many of which were adopted in the late 1960's and 1970's.
Id., at 649. The District Court nonetheless permitted elections to go forward, with the winners allowed to take office

Cite as: 519 U. S. 9 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

if Louisiana filed a judicial preclearance action within 90
days. Id., at 651. We held that the District Court erred in
authorizing these elections in the absence of preclearance,
pointing out that although Louisiana had been aware for at
least three years that the judgeships were not precleared, it
had still failed to file for judicial preclearance. Id., at 655.
We acknowledged in Clark that earlier decisions such as
Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379 (1971), and Berry v.
Doles, 438 U. S. 190 (1978) (per curiam), held that where a
covered jurisdiction had already conducted elections under
an unprecleared plan, it might be appropriate for the district
court to afford local officials an opportunity to seek federal
approval before ordering a new election. 500 U. S., at 654.
But those cases raised an issue different from the one
in Clark. In Perkins and Berry, the District Courts confronted the question whether to set aside illegal elections
that had already taken place. By contrast, the District
Court in Clark had to decide whether to allow illegal elections to go forward in the first place. In this situation, "§ 5's
prohibition against implementation of unprecleared changes
required the District Court to enjoin the election." 500
U. S., at 654.
The District Court faced fundamentally the same problem
here as in Clark. The County did not preclear the ordinances as required by § 5. For several- years, the County
had been on notice that its electoral changes were subject
to §5's preclearance requirements, yet it never obtained
judicial or administrative preclearance of the consolidation
ordinances. In Clark, we left open the question whether a
district court may ever deny a § 5 plaintiff's motion for an
injunction and allow a covered jurisdiction to conduct an
election under an unprecleared voting plan. We suggested
that "[a]n extreme circumstance might be present if a seat's
unprecleared status is not drawn to the attention of the [covered jurisdiction] until the eve of the election and there are
equitable principles that justify allowing the election to pro-

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

ceed." Id., at 654-655. We found no such exigency to exist
in Clark, and we find none here.
The State contends that there is a difference between a
district court's failing to enjoin an unprecleared election
scheme-the situation in Clark-and its ordering, pursuant to its equitable remedial authority, an election under an
unprecleared plan. Regardless whether this distinction is
meaningful, it does not advance the argument that the County's judicial elections may be held without §5 preclearance.
We have recognized, at least in cases raising claims under
the Fourteenth Amendment, that § 5 preclearance requirements may not apply where a district court independently
crafts a remedial electoral plan. McDaniel v. Sanchez,
supra, 148-150 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-295, pp. 18-19 (1975)).
But where a court adopts a proposal "reflecting the policy
choices ... of the people [in a covered jurisdiction] ...

the

preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act is applicable." 452 U. S., at 153. The at-large, countywide system
under which the District Court ordered the County to conduct elections undoubtedly "refiect[ed] the policy choices"
of the County; it was the same system that the County
had adopted in the first place. It was, therefore, error for
the District Court to order elections under that system before it had been precleared by either the Attorney General
or the United States District Court for the' District of
Columbia.
We appreciate the predicament that the District Court
faced. The County did not submit the consolidation ordinances for preclearance when they were adopted many years
ago, and the District Court concluded that changes have occurred in the intervening years that make unrealistic a return to the judicial election plan of 1968, now nearly 30 years
old. Since there may be no practical way to go back to the
1968 plan, simply enjoining the elections would leave the
County without a judicial election system. The County and
appellants seem unable to fashion an election plan that does

Cite as: 519 U. S. 9 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

not contravene the California Constitution, and the State has
vigorously opposed each of the parties' proposals as violative
of state law.
These complications do not, however, change the basic nature of the § 5 preclearance process. Congress designed the
preclearance procedure "to forestall the danger that local decisions to modify voting practices will impair minority access
to the electoral process." McDaniel, 452 U. S., at 149 (footnote omitted). Congress chose to accomplish this purpose
by giving exclusive authority to pass on the discriminatory
effect or purpose of an election change to the Attorney General and to the District Court for the District of Columbia.
As we explained in McDaniel, "[b]ecause a large number of
voting changes must necessarily undergo the preclearance
process, centralized review enhances the likelihood that recurring problems will be resolved in a consistent and expeditious way." Id., at 151 (footnote omitted). Once a covered
jurisdiction has complied with these preclearance requirements, § 5 provides no further remedy. Allen v. State Bd.
of Elections, 393 U. S., at 549-550.
This congressional choice in favor of specialized review
necessarily constrains the role of the three-judge district
court. On a complaint alleging failure to preclear election
changes under § 5, that court lacks authority to consider the
discriminatory purpose or nature of the changes. Perkins
v. Matthews, supra, at 385 ("What is foreclosed to such district court is what Congress expressly reserved for consideration by the District Court for the District of Columbia or
the Attorney General-the determination whether a covered
change does or does not have the purpose or effect 'of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or
color"'). The three-judge district court may determine only
whether § 5 covers a contested change, whether § 5's approval requirements were satisfied, and if the requirements
were not satisfied, what temporary remedy, if any, is appropriate. See City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S.125,

LOPEZ v. MONTEREY COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

129, n. 3 (1983); United States v. Board of Supervisors of
Warren Cty., 429 U. S. 642, 645-647 (1977) (percuriam);Perkins, supra, at 385; Allen, supra, at 558-559. The goal of a
three-judge district court facing a § 5 challenge must be to
ensure that the covered jurisdiction submits its election plan
to the appropriate federal authorities for preclearance as expeditiously as possible.
In this case, nearly five years after appellants brought
their challenge, neither the Attorney General nor the
District Court for the District of Columbia has yet made
any findings regarding the retrogressive effect-or lack
thereof-of the consolidation ordinances adopted between
1972 and 1983. The County dismissed its declaratory judgment action before the District Court for the District of Columbia made any findings, and it has never submitted the
consolidation ordinances to the Attorney General for review.
Although the District Court initially ordered the County to
obtain preclearance of the ordinances, when the County
failed to follow through, the District Court did not enforce
its order.
The District Court itself holds some responsibility for protracting this litigation. Because of its concern that the judicial election plans proposed by the County and appellants
unnecessarily conflicted with California law, the District
Court several times ordered the parties to submit to it an
election plan that complied both with § 5's substantive requirements and with state law, before the County submitted
the plan to federal officials. In so doing, it interposed itself
into the §5 approval process in a way that the statute does
not contemplate. Cf. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42-43
(1982) (per curiam); United States v. Board of Supervisors
of Warren Cty., supra, at 645-647; Perkins,400 U. S., at 385.
In their briefs, both parties raise detailed arguments regarding the effect of the consolidation ordinances on the County's
minority voters, but § 5 requires either the Attorney General
or the District Court for the District of Columbia to resolve

Opinion of the Court

in the first instance whether the consolidated municipal court
system is retrogressive compared to the system existing in
1968.
The County has not discharged its obligation to submit its
voting changes to either of the forums designated by Congress. The requirement of federal scrutiny should be satisfied without further delay. See Berry v. Doles, 438 U. S.,
at 192. The State appears willing to assist the County in
pursuing the issue before either the Attorney General or the
District Court for the District of Columbia, and its effort will
doubtless be of assistance.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
