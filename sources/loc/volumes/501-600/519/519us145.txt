OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Per Curiam

GREENE v. GEORGIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE
SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA
No. 96-5369. Decided December 16, 1996
Petitioner was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and aggravated assault by a Georgia jury and sentenced to death. Over his objection, the
trial court excused for cause five jurors who expressed reservations
.about the death penalty. The State Supreme Court affirmed, citing
Wainwright V. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, as "controlling authority" for a rule
'that appellate courts must defer to trial courts' juror bias findings.
Held. Witt is not controlling authority as to the standard of review to be
applied by state appellate courts reviewing trial courts' jury selection
-rulings. Witt arose on federal habeas, where deference to state-court
findings is mandated by 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d), but that statute does not
govern the standard of review of trial court findings by the Georgia
Supreme Court. That court mistakenly believed itself bound by Witt's
standard. It is free to adopt that standard, but it need not do so.
Certiorari granted; 266 Ga. 439, 469 S. E. 2d 129, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and
aggravated assault by a jury in Taylor County, Georgia, and
sentenced to death. At trial, over petitioner's objection, the
court excused for cause five jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412 (1985),
as "controlling authority" for a rule that appellate courts
must defer to trial courts' findings concerning juror bias.
266 Ga. 439, 440-442, 469 S. E. 2d 129, 134-135 (1996).
Wainwright v. Witt, supra, delineated the standard under
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments for determining
when a juror may be excused for cause because of his views
on the death penalty: whether these views would "'prevent
or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a
juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath."' Id.,
at 424. Addressing petitioner's federal constitutional chal-

Per Curiam

lenge to the juror disqualifications in this case, the Supreme
Court of Georgia correctly recognized that Witt is "the controlling authority as to the death-penalty qualification of prospective jurors .... ." 266 Ga., at 440, 469 S. E. 2d, at 134.*
Witt also held that, under 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d), federal
courts must accord a presumption of correctness to state
courts' findings of juror bias. 469 U. S., at 426-430. The
Supreme Court of Georgia said that Witt was also "controlling authority" on this point, and it therefore ruled that
"[tihe conclusion that a prospective juror is disqualified for
bias is one that is based upon findings of demeanor and credibility which are peculiarly within the trial court's province
and such findings are to be given deference by appellate
courts. Wainwright v. Witt, [469 U. S.,] at 428." 266 Ga.,
at 441, 469 S. E. 2d, at 134-135.
Witt is not "controlling authority" as to the standard of
review to be applied by state appellate courts reviewing trial
courts' rulings on jury selection. Witt was a case arising
on federal habeas, where deference to state-court findings is
mandated by 28 U. S. C. ยง2254(d). But this statute does not
govern the standard of review of trial court findings by the
Supreme Court of Georgia. There is no indication in that
court's opinion that it viewed Witt as merely persuasive
authority, or that the court intended to borrow or adopt
the Witt standard of review for its own purposes. It believed itself bound by Witt's standard of review of trial
court findings on jury-selection questions, and in so doing it
was mistaken.
In a similar case involving a state court's mistaken view
that the First Amendment required it to reach a particular
result, we said: "We conclude that although the State of Ohio
may as a matter of its own law privilege the press in the
circumstances of this case, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not require it to do so." Zacchini v. Scripps*We express no opinion as to the correctness of the Supreme Court of
Georgia's application of the Witt standard in this case.

Here, too, the Supreme Court of Georgia is free to adopt the
rule laid down in Witt for review of trial court findings in
jury-selection cases, but it need not do so. The motion for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a
writ of certiorari are therefore granted, the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Georgia is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
