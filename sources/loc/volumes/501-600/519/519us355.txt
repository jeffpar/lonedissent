Per Curiam

BIBLES, OREGON DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF LAND
MANAGEMENT v. OREGON NATURAL
DESERT ASSOCIATION
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-713.

Decided February 18, 1997

Certiorari granted; 83 F. 3d 1168, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
held that Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), 5 U. S. C. ยง 552(b)(6), did not forbid disclosure of a
mailing list maintained by petitioner for the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), and sought by respondent, the Oregon
Natural Desert Association (ONDA). In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied upon the "substantial public interest in knowing to whom the government
is directing information, or as ONDA characterizes it,
'propaganda,' so that those persons may receive information
from other sources that do not share the BLM's self-interest
in presenting government activities in the most favorable light." 83 F. 3d 1168, 1171 (1996) (emphasis added).
"There is," the Court of Appeals said, "a significant public
interest in knowing with whom the government has chosen
to communicate and in providing those persons with additional information....." Id., at 1172 (emphasis added).
These statements, which are the sum total of the Court of
Appeals' analysis of the public interest in disclosure, make
clear that the court's judgment rested on a perceived public
interest in "providing [persons on the BLM's mailing list]
with additional information." That is inconsistent with our
opinion in Department of Defense v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487
(1994), which said that "the only relevant public interest in
the FOIA balancing analysis" is "the extent to which disclo-

sure of the information sought would 'she[d] light on an
agency's performance of its statutory duties' or otherwise let
citizens know 'what their government is up to."' Id., at 497
(emphasis added) (quoting Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S. 749, 773 (1989)).
"'[T]he purposes for which the request for information is
made,"' we said, have no bearing on whether information
must be disclosed under FOIA. 510 U. S., at 496 (quoting
Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, supra, at 771).
The petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
