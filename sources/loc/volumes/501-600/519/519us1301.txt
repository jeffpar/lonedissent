OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS

NETHERLAND, WARDEN v. GRAY
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY OF EXECUTION
No. A-425.

Decided December 23, 1996

Virginia's application to vacate the stay of execution in respondent Gray's

case is denied. There appears to be no execution scheduled. Thus, it
cannot be stayed, and there is nothing to be vacated.
v. Tuggle, 517 U. S. 1301.

See Netherland

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.

The Commonwealth of Virginia has asked me to vacate the
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's stay of execution
in respondent Gray's case, noting that the court did not purport to follow the standard for such stays set out in Barefoot
v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983).
In Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 170-171 (1996), we
remanded to the Court of Appeals Gray's claim that the
Commonwealth had violated due process by misleading him
about evidence it intended to use at sentencing. The court
held that the claim was procedurally defaulted. Gray v.
Netherland,99 F. 3d 158, 166 (CA4 1996). The Court of Appeals therefore remanded Gray's case to the District Court
with instructions to dismiss his habeas corpus petition but
added, "[i]n view of the Supreme Court's opinion remanding
the case to us, we think the respectful course is to stay both
our mandate and [Gray's] execution until such time as the
Supreme Court rules on any petition for certiorari." Ibid.
We have repeatedly and recently stated that it is not appropriate for a court of appeals to grant a stay of execution
to permit a death-row inmate to file a petition for a writ of
certiorari without first conducting the Barefoot inquiry.

NETHERLAND v. GRAY
Opinion in Chambers

See Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951, 952 (1995). We
have rejected the view that "a capital defendant as a matter
of right [is] entitled to a stay of execution until he has filed
a petition for certiorari in due course." Ibid.
I nonetheless deny the Commonwealth's motion to vacate
the stay of execution because, so far as I can tell, there is no
execution scheduled. If there is no execution scheduled, it
cannot be stayed, and there is nothing for me to vacate. See
Netherland v. Tuggle, 517 U. S. 1301 (1996) (REHNQUIST,
C. J., Circuit Justice) (no stay of execution to vacate where
Court of Appeals had only stayed its own mandate).
