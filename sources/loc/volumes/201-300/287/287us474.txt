on. But this action worked no material disadvantage
to the Government. Indeed the veteran made payments
when in fact entitled to receive monthly benefits for
total disability. If the converted policy had been allowed finally to lapse because of nonpayment of premiums, the agreement between the parties would have
been fully complied with. Nevertheless the proper admission is that under such circumstances there could
have been a recovery on the original policy, upon actual
surrender of the expired policy. The Gdvernment now
has possession of the cancelled converted policy and is
in no worse position than it would be in the supposed
circumstances.

CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 314. Argued November 8, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.
1. The Circuit Court of Appeals, its rules so providing, may notice a
plain error, though not assigned. P. 480.
2. Where the bill of exceptions recited that a motion for a new trial
had been made and overruled but omitted to state the ground of the
motion, held that the omission was not fatal to review, the ground
being otherwise manifested in the record. Id.
3. The rule that this Court will not review the action of a federal trial
court in granting or denying a motion for a new trial for error of
fact applies also to the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 481.
4. Where the evidence in an action on a contract is such that the
plaintiff, if entitled to recover anything, is entitled to substantial
damages, but there are issues properly before the jury going to the
liability of the defendant, a verdict for the plaintiff limited to nominal damages and costs does not reveal on its face inconsistency with
the duty of the jury to assess damages; and where in such case the
trial court, without assigning reasons, refuses a new trial, its act can
not be held erroneous as a matter of law. P. 483.

the District Court to set aside this verdict was not a decision upon a question of fact but of law, and reviewable
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. James v. Evans, 149

Fed. 696; United States v. Routt County Coal Co., 248
Fed. 483, 485.
The petitioner entirely lacks any substantial or meritorious defense, for as the record shows, and as the Circuit Court of Appeals found, it broke its contract wholly
without justification.
The verdict should have been set aside and a new trial
ordered on appellants' motion. United Press Assn. v. Nat.
Newspapers Assn., 254 Fed. 284, and cases supra.
The judgment below is right without regard to whether
the order denying a new trial is appealable; for, the judgment appjealed from may be supported upon grounds not
considered and. reasons not assigned by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. .531, 538; Story
Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., 282 U. S. 555, 560; and
the charge of the District Court as to the measure of
damages, was plainly erroneous.
But the order refusing a new trial was appealable.
There was not involved any reexamination of facts, but
merely a review of a matter of law. The finding of one
dollar daniages was arbitrary, not supported by evidence,
but contrary to all the uncontradieted evidence of disinterested witnesses; and the setting aside of such verdict is
not a matter of discretion but of law. Mills v. Scott, 99

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Cub Fork Coal Company and Paragon Colliery Company brought this action in the federal-court for southern
Indiana to recover from Fairmount Glass Works $32,417,
with interest, as damages for breach of a contract to purchase 17,500 tons of coal, at $6.50 per ton f. o. b. mines,
deliverable in twelve monthly instalinents beginning June
1920. Jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked on
the ground of'diversity of citizenship. -The Glass Works
pleaded in bar several defenses; and it also set up a counterclaim in the sum of $2,000 as damages for failure to
make delivery as provided by the contract; Three trials
before a jury were had. At each of the first two the verdict was for the defendant; and each time the judgment
entered thereon was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals with a general direction for a new trial, 19 F. (2d)
273; 33 F. (2d) 420. On the third trial the plaintiffs recovered a verdict for $1; and, after further proceedings,
judgment was entered thereon with costs.
The plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals
"for the reasons set forth in the assignment of errors."

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

The errors assigned were the failure to give eleven requested instructions. Nine instructions sought related
solely to the question of liability. None of the instructions requested and refused related to the measure of
damages. But the first asked for a directed verdict for
$42,773.50, and the second asked that if a verdict were
rendered for the plaintiffs the damages be set at
$42,773.50. The charge given was not otherwise excepted
to. It had appeared at the trial that after receiving in
instalments about 6,330 tons of coal, the defendant
refused, on December 4, 1920, to accept further deliveries;
and that there was a continuing serious decline in the
market price of coal from that date to the end of the
twelve* months fixed by the contract for delivery. The
defendant had insisted upon the several defenses pleaded
in bar as well as upon the couhterclaim. After the verdict the defendant was allowed to amend the counterclaim, so as to allege that the market price of coal was $11
a ton at the time plaintiffs failed to make the deliveries
therein referred to and that the defendant's damages from
such failure were $10,000. The record recites that a motion for a new trial was made by the plaintiffs and overruled, and that the overruling was excepted to; but the
grounds of the motion, and of the refusal to grant it, arc
not stated. The errors assigned do not include any reference to the motion for a new trial; or to the exception
which was taken to the allowance of the amendment of
the counterclaim after verdict.
The Circuit- Court of Appeals deemed it unnecessary
to consider the nine instructions relating to liability, since
the verdict for the plaintiffs "upon the issues which determined liability was amply sustained by the evidence."
Nor did it discuss the two instructions which alone referred. to the amount of damages recoverable. But it
made an order substantially as follows: If within thirty
days the parties shall stipulate that the judgment be

FAIRMOUNT GLASS WORKS v. COAL CO. 479
474

Opinion of the Court.

modified by substituting for $1 the sum of $18,500 (or
other agreed sum) with interest at the rate of five per
cent from December 4, 1920 and costs, the judgment as
so modified shall be affirmed; otherwise the judgment
shall be reversed and a new trial be had "limited only to
an ascertainment of appellants' [plaintiffs'] recoverable
damages and the amount of appellee's counterclaim, if
upon a. new trial it appears that appellee is entitled to any
recovery or set-off on its counterclaim." 59 F. (2d) 539.
As the parties did not stipulate for the modification
suggested by the Court of Appeals, it ordered that the
judgment be reversed with costs, and that the cause be
remanded to the District Court with direction to grant a
new trial limited as stated. The defendant petitioned this
Court for a writ of certiorari on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals, in violation of the Seventh Amendment of the Federal Constitution, re-examined the verdict
of the jury otherwise than according to the rules of the
common law and reversed the judgment solely for alleged
error of fact in the verdict and for the alleged error of the
trial court in overruling a motion for a new trial. Certiorari'was granted.
The reasons assigned by the Circuit Court of Appeals
for its action were substantially these: It appears that a
large sum is recoverable as damages; that the minimum
recoverable may be detemined with substantial accuracy
by computation, for the defendant " breached its contract
without justification on December 4, 1920" and "the
market price of co.al is shown for each day of the month,
and the average price per month is also disclosed, so that
the actual amount of damages is quite definitely ascertainable" despite "a slight discrepancy in the statements
of witnesses." The amount shipped and the amount received are also quite definitely ascertainable, despite a
discrepancy "due apparently to the fact that the railroad
confiscated a small amount of the coal on several occa-

sions."- Computing plaintiffs' damages ' upon the basis
most favorable to the" defendant, and the defendant's
damages on the counterclaim also Qn the basis most
favorable'to it, plaintiffs appear clearly to be entitled to
$18,250 with interest at the rate of five per cent from
December 4, 1920 and costs. As the jury fixed the damages at $1, the verdict should have been set aside and a
new'trial granted. Since in.view of Slocum v. New York
Life Insurance Co., 228 U. S. 364, the court is "not at
"'libertyto direct judgment for such amount as we believe
would fairly represent" plaintiffs' damages, the parties
should be given the. opportunity of disposing of the case
without further litigation by entering into an agreement
as to the damages. If the parties do-not so agree, a new
trial should be granted; limited to the ascertainment of
damages, as in Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Rfg.
Co., 283 U. S. 494.
If the refusal to grant the motion for a new trial was
deemed by the Circuit Court of Appeals plain reversible
-error it was at liberty under its rules to notice the error
although not assigned; I and the omission from the record
of the grounds of the motion would be no obstacle to a
review, since, the motion was obviously directed to the
failure to award substantial damages.2 But we are of
'Rule. 10 (4) of the Circuit. Court of Appeals for the Seventh

opinion that the action of the District Court was not
reversible error.
First. The rule that this Court will not review the action
of a federal trial court in granting or denying a motion for
a new trial for error of fact has been settled by a long and
unbroken line of decisions; I and has been frequently applied where the ground of the motion was that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive or were inadequate.' The rule precludes likewise a review of such
actioA by a circuit court of appeals.5 Its early formulation by this-Court was influenced by the mandate of theJudiciary Act of 1789, which provided in § 22 that there
should be ".no reversal in either [circuit or Supreme]
court on such writ of error . . .for any error in fact."

Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

Sometimes the rule has been rested on that part of the
Seventh Amendment which provides that "no fact tried
by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of
the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law. ' 7 More frequently the reason given for the
denial of review is that the granting or refusing of a mo.tion for a new trial is a matter within the discretion of the
trial court.8
It has been suggested that a review must be denied because of the historical limitation of the writ of error to
matters within the record, of which the motion for a new
trial was not a part.9 Compare Judge Learned Hand in
Miller v. Maryland Casualty Co., 40 F. (2d) 463. But
the denial of review can no longer rest upon this ground,
since the record before the appellate court has been enlarged to include in the bill of exceptions a motion for a
new trial, made either before or after judgment. Cornpare Harrisonv. United States, 7 F. (2d) 259, 262. Under
certain circumstances the appellate court may enquire
into the action of the trial court on a motion for a new
trial. Thus,.its denial may be reviewed if the trial court

erroneously excluded from consideration matters which
were appropriate to a, decision on the motion, Mattox v.
United States, 146 U. S. 140; Ogden v. United States, 112
Fed. 523; or if it acted on the mistaken view that there
was no jurisdiction to grant it, or that there was no authority to grant it on the ground advanced, Feltonv. Spiro,
78 Fed. 576, 581; Dwyer v. United States, 170 Fed. 160,
165; Paine v. St. Paul Union Stockyards Co., 35 F. (2d)
624, 626-628. It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine whether the circumstances of the case at bar justify
an enquiry into the trial court's refusal to set aside the
verdict.
Second. It is urged that the motion for a new trial presented an issue of law. The argument is that on the motion or on the court's own initiative the verdict should
have been set aside as inconsistent on its face, since if the
plaintiffs were entitled to recover at all they were entitled
to substantial, not merely nominal, damages. The case,
it is contended, is comparable to one in which the award
of damages exceeded a statutory limit, see Southern Ry.
Co. v. Bennett, 233 U. S. 80; or was less than an amount
undisputed' Glenwood IrrigationCo. v. Vatlery, 248 Fed.
483; Stetson v. Stindt, 279 Fed. 209; or was in pursuance
a limited class of cases by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854,
17 & 18 Vict., c. 125, § 35, which provided, however, that "where
the application for a new trial is upon Matter of Discretion only, as
on the ground that the Verdict was against the Weight of Evidence
or otherwise, no such Appeal shall be allowed." Since the Judicature
Acts, which abolished 'proceedings in error in civil cases and substituted an appeal, (see Judicature Act, 1875, 38 & 39 Vict., c. 77, Order
58 (1)), appellate procedure has been regulated by Rules of Court.
Compare Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925,
15 & 16 Geo. V, c. 49, § 99 (f), as amended by 18 Geo. V, c. 26, § 8.
The present Rules provide that applications for new trials are to be
made to the Court of Appeal, which shall have the same.powers on
the hearing as it exercises on an appeal. See Annual Practice, 1933,
Order 39, Rules 1 and 2.

9 F. (2d) 753, 757-758.
To regard the verdict as inconsistent on its face is to
assume that the jury found -for the plaintiff and failed to
perform its task of assessing damages. The trial judge
was not obliged so to regard the verdict. The defendant
had insisted upon several defenses and had set up a counterclaim." The plaintiffs were not entitled to a directed
verdict. .The evidence was voluminous; and, on some issues at least, conflicting. The instructions left the contested issues of liability to the jury. The verdict may
have represented a finding for the defendant oi those
issues; 11 the reason for the award of nominal damages
may have been that the jury wished the costs to be taxed

Opinion of the Court.

against the defendant. The defendant did not complain
of the verdict. The record before us doesnot contain any
explanation by the trial court of the refusal to grant a new
12
trial, or any interpretation by it of the jury's verdict.

In the absence of such expressions by the trial court in the
case 4t bar, the refusal to grant a new trial cannot be held
erroneous as a matter of law. Appellate courts should be
slow to impute to juries a disregard of their duties, and to
trial courts a want of diligence or perspicacity in appraising the jury's conduct. Compare Union Pacific R. Co. v.
Hadley, 246 U. S. 330, 334; Dunn v. United States, 284
U. S. 390,394.
Third. It is urged that the refusal to set aside the
verdict was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, and
hence reviewable. The Court of Appeals has not declared
that the trial judge abused his discretion. Clearly the
-mere refusal to grant a new trial where nominal damages
were awarded is not an abuse of discretion. This Court
has frequently refrained from disturbing the trial court's
approval of an award of damages which seemed excest
sive or inadequate," and the circuit courts of appeals
have generally followed a similar polity.14 Whether refusal to set aside a verdict for failure to award substantial damages may ever be reviewed on the ground that
the trial judge abused his discretion, we have'io occasion
to determine.

Fourth. The respondents contend that the District
Court erred in charging that the measure of damages
was the difference between the contract price and the
market price at the time of the breach, instead of the
market prices at the times for delivery; and that this
error may be relied upon here in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Compare United States
v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435436; Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531, 538; Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., 282 U. S. 555, 561. There was
no requpst for an instruction on this subject and no
objection 'was made to that given until after the jury
had retired. The trial judge was under no obligation
to recall the jury.. Moreover, the instruction given and
the refusal to recall the jury were not assigned as error
on appeal to the Court of Appeals;* nor did that court
mention the matter. Under the Rules of both the Court
of Appeals and this Court the exception taken after the
jury retired came too late to furnish a basis for revieW. 5
We have, therefore, no occasion to cdnsider the meaning
of the charge given, its. correctness as a matter of law, or
the materiality of the error, if any, in giving it.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.
Reversed.

senting.
A verdict found in contravention of the instructions of
the court may be reversed on appeal as contrary to law.
So much the prevailing opinion apparently concedes.
" See Rule 9, paragraph 1, of- the Rules of the Circuit Court of
Appeals for .the Seventh Circuit; and Rule 8, paragraph 1, of the
Rules of this Court. Also Phelps v. Mayer, 15 How. 160, 161;

Co. v. Neely, 13 F. (2d) 361.

FAIRMOUNT GLASS WORKS v. COAL CO. 487
474

STONE

and CARuozo, JJ., dissenting.

The verdict of $1 returned by the jury upon the trial
of this cause may not be squared with their instructions
and hence was properly annulled.
By the instructions of the trial judge they were required, if they found that the defendant had broken its
contract, to award to the plaintiffs the difference between
the contract price of the coal and its market value, after
allowance for the defendant's counterclaim. The evidence most favorable to the defendant, both as to claim
and counterclaim, made it necessary, if there was any
breach, to return a substantial verdict, the minimum being capable of accurate computation. The distinction is
not to be ignored between this case of a breach of contract
and the cases cited in the prevailing opinion where the
liability was in tort. Here the minimum, if not the maximum, damages are fixed and definite. There the discretion of the jury was not subject to tests so determinate
and exact. The question is not before us whether even
in such circumstances there may be revision on appeal.
Cf. Pugh v. Bluff City Excursion Co., 177 Fed. 399.
Enough for present purposes that in the circumstances of
the case at hand the verdict for $1 is a finding that the
contract had been broken, and this irrespective of the motive that caused the verdict to be given. What the motive was we cannot know from anything disclosed to us
by the record. Nothing there disclosed lays a basis for a
holding that the nominal verdict for the plaintiffs was
designed to save them from the costs which the law would
have charged against them if there had been a verdict for
defendant. The jury were not instructed as to the liability for costs, and for all that appears had no knowledge
on the subject. Nor would such a motive, if there were
reason to ascribe it, rescue them from the reproach of disobedience and error. It would merely substitute one form
of misconduct for another. It would do this, moreover,
in contradiction of the record. By no process of mere

construction can a verdict that nominal loss has resulted
from a breach be turned into a verdict that there had been
no breach at all. On the face of the record, the jury found
there was a wrong, and then, in contravention of instructions, refused, either through misunderstanding or through
wilfulness, to assess the damages ensuing.
Justice is not promoted in its orderly administration
when such conduct is condoned.

WABASH VALLEY ELECTRIC CO. v. YOUNG ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOVTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA.

No. 128. Argued December 7, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.
L' In fixing rates of a public utility for part of 'the territory
served, conditions may be such as to require or permit that the
property used and useful in serving the smaller area be treated as
* the rate base rather than the entire plant serving the whole territory. P. 497.
2. An electrical plant, built and operated as a generating and distributing plant for a single municipality, became part of a large system.
.The new owner" ceased to generate current locally and brought in
current over its lines from without. It served many other towns
and cities, and also delivered varying proportions of the entire current borne by its lines to affiliated companies for delivery to their
customers, including many towns and cities within their respective
territories. Held:
(1) That under the Indiana Public Utility Act, the municipality
was properly treated as the unit for determining the rates to be'
charged therein, and that this is consisient with due process.
Pp. 495-498.
(2) The property to be valued i§ that which is used and useful
for supplying current to the municipality, adding thereto the proportionate part of the value of the general distributing system fairly
attributable to the local service, but disregarding local plants in,
other municipalities which aie separate and distinct and bear no
relation to the one in question. P. 499.
