287 U.S.

PORTER, AUDITOR, v. INVESTORS SYNDICATE.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
(ON REHEARING.)
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA.

No. 627 (October Term, 1931). Reargued November 14, 1932.Decided December 5, 1932.
Section 1 of Article IV'of the Montana Constitution, dealing with the
separation of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, does
not preclude the exercise by the state district courts of the administrative powers which were considered upon the former'decision of
this case. P. 347.

UPoN rehearing of the case reported in 286 U. S., p. 461.
The decision previously made is adhered to.
Mr. T. H. MacDonald for appellant.
Mr. M. S. Gunn for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered

the opinion of the

Court.
In this cause, reversing the decree of the United States
District Court, we held [286 U. S. 461] that the appellee
had failed to exhaust the administrative remedy afforded
by the Montana statute, and that the federal court was
therefore without jurisdictioi as a court of equity to
enjoin enforcement of the State Auditor's order.
The appellee has presented a petition for rehearing
which concedes the correctness of our ruling that the
statute gives a remedy partly administrative in character,
by suit in the state district court, but contends that by
this grant the act violates Article IV, ยง 1, of the Montana
Constitution, which is:
. c The powers of the government of this State are divided ifnto three distinct departments: The Legislative,

Opinion of the.Court.

Executive, and Judicial, and no person or collection of
persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any
powers properly belonging to either of the others, except
as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted."
As this question was not briefed or argued wvhen the
case was first heard we granted a reargument; and the
cause has again been presented on this point.
The statute plainly affords a remedy which, though in
certain respects judicial, is in others administrative. The
courts of Montana have not passed upon its constitutionality as affected by the quoted section of the fundamental
law of the State. Such expressions of the Supreme Court
as have been brought to our attention indicate that
Article IV, ยง 1, does not forbid the conference on the state
district courts of administrative powers in connection with
and ancillary to their judicial functions. O'Neill v. Yellowstone Irrigation Dist., 44 Mont. 492; 121 Pac. 283;
State v. Johnson, 75 Mont. 240, 249; 243 Pac. 1073.
Compare State ex rel. Kellogg v. District Court, 13 Mont.
370; 34 Pac. 298;. Hillis v. Sullivan, 48 Mont. 320; 137
P~c. 392.
An adjudication of the question by the state supreme
court would bind us, Gulf C. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Dennis,
224 U. S. 503. In the absence of such: decision we are
reluctant to construe a state constitution, Louisville & N.
R. Co. v. Garrett, 231 U. S. 298; but as our decision requires that the alleged conflict of state statute and state
constitution be resolved we must pass upon it. .Southern
Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260 U. S.519, 522. In view of'the Montana cases to which reference has been made, we are not
convinced that the statute is offensive to the Montana
Constitution, and adhere' to the judgment heretofore
entered.
