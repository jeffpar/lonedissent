all its shares with the intention of selling them at a profit.
He treated it as something apart from his ordinary affairs,
accepted credits for salaries as an officer, claimed loss to
himself because of loans to it which had become worthless, and caused it to make returns for taxation distinct
from his own. Nothing indicates that he regarded the
corporation as his agent with authority to contract or
act in his behalf. Ownership of all the stock is not
enough to show that creation and management of the
corporation was a part of his ordinary business. Certainly, under the general rule for tax purposes a corporation is an entity distinct from its stockholders,' and the
circumstances here are npt so unusual as to create an
exception.

BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. CLARK.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 180. Argued November 14, 1932.-Decided December 12, 1932.
The taxpayer was interested in a corporation engaged in river and
harbor improvement work, as. majority stockholder and "president,
and devoted himself largely to its affairs. He was also interested
in other concerns engaged in similar work and- had investments in
other corporate shares. He treated the corporation as a separate
entity for taxation, and made separate personal income tax returns.
Through endorsement of obligations of the corporation, and sale of
its stock, he suffered net' losses in 1921 and 1922, for which he
claimed deductions in his return for 1923. He was not in the business of endorsing or buying and selling securities. Held:
The losses did not resilt "from the operation of any trade or
business rejgularly carried' on by the taxpayer," and, under the
Revenue Act of 1921, ยง 204, were not deductible from gains of succeeding years. P. 414.

to review a judgment reversing a decision

of the Board of Tax Appeals, 19 B. T. A. 859, which sustained an order of the Commissioner determining a defi-

ciency in income tax. Cf. the cases next preceding and
following.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher, and Messrs. Whitney North
Seymour, Sewall Key, and John H. McEvers were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. William S. Hammers for respondent.
MR. JusTICE MbRYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Respondent Clark's income tax return for 1921 showed
net loss exceeding $17,000; for 1922 net loss of about
$5,000. He claimed these should be deducted from gains
reported for 1923, under ยง 204 (a) -and (b),I Revenue

Rdvenue Act, 1921: "Sec. 204 (a). That as used in this section the
term 'net loss' means only net losses resulting from the operation of
any trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer (including
losses sustained from the sale or other disposition of real estate, machinery, and other capital assets, used in the conduct of such trade or
business); and when so resulting means the excess of the deductions
allowed by section 214 or 234, as the case may be, over the sum of the
following: (1) The gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year,
(2) the amount by which the interest received free from taxation
under this title exceeds so much of the interest paid or accrued vithin
the taxable year on indebtedness as is not permitted to be deducted
by paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of section 214 or by paragraph
(2) of subdivision '(a) of section 234, (3) the amount by which the
deductible losses not sustained in such trade or business exceed the
taxable gains or profits not derived from such trade or business, (4)
amounts received as dividends and allowed as a deduction under

Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 231. The Commissioner
of Internal Revenue ruled otherwise and the Board of
Tax Appeals approved. The Court of Appeals, District
of Columbia; reversed the Board's action. [61 App. D. C.
217; 59 F. (2d) 1031.] The matter is here upon
certiorari.
From 1899 until 1922 respondent was closely connected
with the Bowers Southern Dredging Company which did
river and harbor improvement work, dredging and jetty
building. He -was majority stockholder, active head,
after 1905 president) and devoted himself largely to its
affairs. During 1921 and 1922 he was a member of three
partnerships similarly engaged and often associated with
the Bowers Company. Also, he owned and held as investments shares of a number of corporations. He was
not in the investment business.
After 1917 the Bowers Company encountered continuous financial difficulties. To protect his interest therein,
at sundry undisclosed times respondent endorsed the company's obligations to the banks. In 1921 a creditor's committee took charge and thereafter respondent. conducted
the corporate affairs as managing director. A new concern took over the entire assets and business in 1922.
Because of his endorsements respondent paid $68,000 for the Company during 1921. He claimed and was althe depletion deduction allowed with respect to any mine, oil or gas
well as is based upon discovery value in lieu of cost.
"(b) If for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1920,
it appears upon the production of evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner that any taxpayer has sustained a net loss, the amount
thereof shall be deducted from the net income of the taxpayer for the
succeeding taxable year; and if such net loss is in excess of the net
income for. such succeeding taxable year, the amount of such excess
shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income for the
next succeeding taxable year; the deduction in all cases to be made
under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval

of the Secretary."

lowed to deduct the sum thus lost upon his return for
that year. During the same year he also lost. $9,500
through sale of the corporation's stock and in 1922 he sustained a-similar loss amounting to $92,500. For both

these sums appropriate deductions were permitted.
After considering all the circumstances, the Commissioner held respondent's losses did not result "from the
operation -of any trade or business regularly carried on by

the taxpayer," and could not be deducted from gains of
succeeding years. The Board of Tax Appeals approved.

Among other things, it said"In order for the losses here involved to be deductible
in determining taxable income for 1923, they must be net
losses resulting from the operation of a trade or business
regularly carried on by the petitioner and not from isolated and occasional transactions ...
"With respect to the loss of $68,000 resulting from the
petitioner's endorsement of the Bowers Company notes,
he testified that in endorsing the notes he was seeking to
protect his investment in its stock. Aside from endorsing
an undisclosed number of notes of this company there is
nothing in the record to indicate that acting as endorser
or guarantor constituted a business or trade with the petitioner. So far as the record shows these were the only
notes ever endorsed by the petitioner for the Bowers
Company or for any other company or person. From the
facts in the case we are of the opinion that the loss did
not result from the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the petitioner but resulted from isolated or occasional transactions. ...
"With respect to the remaining losses resulting fr6m
the sale of the Bowers Company stock in 1921 and 1922,
we do not think the petitioner's ownership of stock in a
number of corporations which he held as an investment
during 1921 and 1922 or the sale of some of such stock
in those years constituted a business or trade regularly

carried on by him. As to his being in the investment
business, the petitioner testified as follows: 'Q. Would
you say you were in the investment business, Mr. Clark?'
'A. No, sir.'
"Since the petitioner was not in the investment busi-"
ness or engaged in the business of a dealer in securities,
we think the losses resulting from the sale of the Bowers
Company stock in 1921 and 1922 constituted losses arising from occasional or isolated transactions and not from
the operation of a business regularly carrieo on. . ....
In support of the contrary view the District Court of
Appeals said:
" It appears that during the times in question appellant was engaged in regularly carrying on the business
of dredging, operated by a corporation of which appellant was principal owner and active directing head, and
to which he devoted all of his time and energies. Appellant accordingly was necessarily concerned with the financial conditions and difficulties which beset the business,
and he was compelled by circunstances to indorse the
company's notes in order to supply it with necessary operating funds. This action was not isolated or occasional
but became part of the operation of the business, and
helped to carry it on. It is true that appellant did not
regularly carry on a business of indorsifig notes for profit,
but his indorsement of the company's notes was part of
the business regularly carried on for the company. It is
also true that appellant was not regularly engaged in the
business of selling corporate stocks, but the transactions
*ofthat character appearing in the record can not be separated from the regular course of business of which they
were part, and must not be considered as if' wholly independent transactions."
We agree with the Commissioner and the Board of Ta
Appeals. The judgment below must be reversed.

Syllabus.

The respondent was employed as an officer of the cor-"
poration; the business which he conducted for it was not
his own. There were other stockholders. And in no
sense can the corporation be regarded as his alter ego, or
agent, He treated it as a separate entity for taxation;
made his own personal return and claimed losses through
dealings with it. He was not regularly engaged in endorsing notes, or buying dnd selling corporate securities.
The unfortunate endorsements were no part of his ordinary business, but occasional transactions intended to
preserve the value of his investment in capital shares.
A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be
treated as separate entities. Only under exceptional circumstances-not present here-can the difference be disregarded.
Reversed.

2. The taxpayer, a corporation wholly owned by the estate of a dece-

dent who had set it up and transferred securities to it as a medium
for avoiding multiljle death duties'and insuring the safety of a

charitable endowment, was assessed a deficiency in its return for
1920 on account of a gain arising out of an exchange of securities
between it and the estate. It contended that there could be no
true gain or loss in transactions between-it and the estate because

they were the same entity. Held: The record-fails to disclose circumstances sufficient to require disregard of the corporate form.
