v. STAR.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS.

No. 282. Argued' December 13, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.
Statutory provisions in Texas governing assignments for the benefit
of creditors, held consistent with the Bankruptcy Act, upon' the
authority of Pobreslov. Joseph M. Boyd Co., ante, p. 518. P. 528.
47 S. W. (2d) 608, affirmed.
APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Texas, which denied a writ of error to the Court of Civil
Appeals, 44 S. W. (2d) 429, but approved the opinion of
that court holding a garnishment irivalid under the state
law governing assignments for the benefit of creditors.

Mr. Spearman Webb submitted for appellants.
Mr. Win. Andress, Jr., with whom Mr. Lee Gammage
Carterwas on the brief, for appellee.
Mr. JUSTICE.BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Prior to March .13, 1931, appellants obtained a, judgment for $113.20 against the Dallas Showcase & Manufacturing Company. On that day the latter, being insolvent and having unsecured indebtedness of about $11,000, made to appellee a voluntary assignment of all its
property for the benefit of its creditors. Appellants refused to accept under the assignment and brought garnishment proceedings in justice court against the appellee. He answered that as such assignee, acting underTitle
12 of the Texas Revised Civil'Statutes, 1925, he had conv erted the assigned property into cash and had $582.63
which, as he insisted, was not subject to garnishment.
The justice of the peace held him liable. He appealed
to the county court and there the case was submitted on
.an agreed statement showing the facts, aforesaid. The
court held the state law in conflict with the Bankruptcy

Act and that therefore the amount on hand was subject
to garnishment. The court of civil appeals reversed, 44
S. W. (2d) 429, and the supreme court approving its
opinion denied writ of error. 47 S. W. (2d) 608.
The sole question is whether, as construed by its highest
court, articles 261-274 of Title 12 are repugnant to the
Bankruptcy Act.
TChese provisions are derived from an Act of March 24,
1879, (Acts 1879, p. 57) as. amended, Acts 1883, p. 46.
Evidently, that statute was intended to take the place
of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, which was repealed in
1878. Cunninghdm v. Norton, 125 U. S. 77, 81. It established a complete system for the administration of
property conveyed by insolvent debtors for the benefit of
their creditors. Tracy v. Tuffly, 134 U. S. 206,223. Every
such assignment is required to provide for ratable distribution of the insolvent's estate among the consenting
creditors and, whether or not so specified, is deemed sufficient to pass all the assignor's property to the assignee.
Art. 261. "A debtor may make such assignment and shall
thereupon siand discharged from all further liability to
such consenting creditors .... Such debtor shall not be
discharged from liability to such creditor who does not
receive as much as one-third of the amount . . . allowed
in his favor. .. ." Art. 263. Non-assenting creditors
take nothing under the assignment, art. 265, but may
garnishee any excess remaining after full payment of consenting creditors and the expenses of executing the assignment. Art. 271.
"The statute in question is in no sense an insolvent
law, providing for the discharge of a debtor by a compliance with its terms without the consent of the creditor;
but is a statute which, for he better protection of creditors, prescribes a mode for the administration of the
estates of insolvents under assignments made by the
debtors themselves, which would be good at common law,

unaided bk the statute, and, like any other trust, could be
-enforced in a court of equity in the absence of a statute
providing a mode of administration." Keatingv. Vaughn,
(1884) 61 Tex. 518, 524. And see Leon & H. Blum v.
Welborne (1882), 58 Tex. 157, 161. McKee v. Coffin(1886), 66 Tex. 304, 309; 1 S. W. 276. Fant v. Elsbury
(1887), 68 Tex. 1, 5; 2 S. W. 866. And in a case arising
after the passage of the present Bankruptcy Act, a lower
court propounded the question whether this law was suspended by the Bankruptcy Act. The supreme court, after
reference to Boese. v. King, 108 U. S. 379, said: "The
effect of the ruling [in that case] is that, in so far at least
as an insolvent.law of a State provides for a release by
the creditors, it.is suspended by a bankrupt law of the
United States, but that if the assignment convey all the
debtor's property subject to the payment of his debts for
the equal benefit of all his creditors who may accept under
it, it is otherwise valid, except as against proceedings seasonably taken under the bankrupt act." .Patty-Joiner&
Eubank Co. v. Cummins(100), 93 Tex. 598, 604; 57 S.
W. 566. And in a later'case the court held that though
the statute in so far as it makes provision for exacting
releases should be held to be an insolvent law, and therefore suspended by the Bankruptcy Act, one who had accepted and received one-third of the amount of.his claim
under an assignment good at common law, though exacting such release, where no proceedings were had wider
the -Bankruptcy Act, thereby discharged the debtor from
liabilify. Haijek & Simecek v. Luck (1903), 96 Tex. 517;
74.S.
W..305.
. In the
case at bar the court of civil appeals for the
fifth
district observed the differences between state insolvency
laws and those merely regulating voluntary assignments
for the benefit of creditors and, following the rule established by the Texas supreme court that non-consenting
creditors may not seize property covered by such assign-

ments, held that the fund in the hands of the assignee
was not garnishable. And the supreme court, approving
that decision and disapproving one to the contrary announced by the court of civil appeals for the sixth district,
Johnson v. ChapmanMilling Co., 37 S. W. (2d) 776, held
that "the questions at issue have been definitely settled
by this court in the cases of" Patty-Joiner& Eubank Co.
v. Cummins, supra., and Haijek & Simecek v. Luck, supra.
Accepting as we do that court's construction of the provisions in question, we are of opinion that they are not
repugnant to the Bankruptcy Act. This case is ruled by
our decision in Pobreslo v. JoSeph M. Boyd Co., ante,
Judgment affirmed.

AETNA LIFE INSURANCE CO. ET AL. v. MOSES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

*No. 137. Argued December 8, 1932-Decided'January 9, 1933.
1. Under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act,--made applicable to the District of Columbia as a workmen's
compensation law-where an employee is killed in the course of his
employment by .the negligence of a stranger, and the administratrix, being also the sole beneficiary, accepts compensation, there is
an implied "statutory assignment to the employer of her cause of
action for the negligence under ihe District death statute. P. 537.
2. In such case the Compensation Act by implication gives the employer the same control over the institution of the death action, the
compromise and settlement of the claim against the wrongdoer, and
th6 disposition of the proceeds, as it gives where the injury results
only in disability. P. 538.
3. Although: the Compensation Act does not say that the action for
wrongful death may be brought in the name of the employer, this
is implied in its purpose to effect a complete tiansfer of the cause of
action, notwithstanding that the common law rule against actions
in the names of assignees of choses in action survives in the forum.
P. 540.
