GRAU v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT, COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 43.

Argued October 10, 1932.-Decided November 7, 1932.

1. An affidavit which merely asserts affiant's belief in the truth of
statements made in the affidavit of another, to which it refers,
is insufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant. P. 127.
2. An affidavit setting forth facts tending to show that the dwelling
described was used as a manufactory of intoxicating liquors, but
which states 'no facts from which a sale, on or off the premises,
necessarily is to be inferred, is insufficient to support the issuance
of a search warrant. National Prohibition Act, Title II, § 25;
Act of June 15, 1917, Title XI, § 6. P. 128.
3. The guaranties of the Fourth Amendment are to be liberally construe'; to prevent impairment of the protection extended. Id.
4. Section 25 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act was intended
to preserve the citizen's right to immunity from unreasonable
search, and it should be construed so as to effect that purpose.
P. 128.
5. The evidence upon which a search warrant is based must be such
as would be competent in a trial before a jury and would lead a
man of prudence and caution to believe that the offense was committed. P. 128.
56 F. (2d) 779, reversed.

Act.

Mr. Charlton B. Thompson, with whom Mr. Stephdns
L. Blakely was on the brief, for petitioner.
The search warrant is invalid on its face because it
does not state the particular grounds or probable cause
for its issuance as required by § 6, Title. XI, Act of June
15, 1917.
The affidavits furnished no basis for the issuance of
the warrant to search a private residence because they
state no facts showing sales of liquor on the premises.

The court below having considered the affidavit adequate to establish probable cause for believing that the
dwelling in question was being used as a "headquarters
for, the merchandising of liquor," we opposed the writ.
We are still of the opinion that a warrant may lawfully
issue to search a dwelling house thus used. Kasprowicz

United States v. Backer, 32 F. (2d) 936. The difficulty
we experience is that upon further consideration we are
unable to escape the conclusion that the allegations of the
affid-vit in question are not sufficiently comprehensive
to support a showing that the premises were used in connection with the sale of liquor anywhere. Nobriga v.

32 F. (2d) 936. The agent was not unaware that the
place to be searched was a private dwelling, and his affidavit should have set forth the evidence of commercialism
in clear, precise, and unequivocal language.
The affidavit did not show that the dwelling house was
being used for any business purpose. For this purpose,
it was not enough to show illegal manufacture. Staker
v. United States, 5 F. (2d) 312; Jozwich v. United States,
288 Fed. 831; United States v. Leach, 24 F. (2d) 965;

United States v. Jajeswiec, 285 Fed., 789. There was
nothing to show continuity of operatjons or any other circumstances from which-it could fairly be assumed that
liquor was being manufactured for commercial purposes.

Mu. JuscE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioner was convicted under an indictment in
two counts, the first charging the unlawful manufacture
of whisky, and the second.possession of property designed
for the unlawful manufacture of intoxicating liquors.'
He complains that certain articles offered at the trial were
obtained by virtue of a void..search warrant and that the
trial court erred in overruling a motion to quash the process and to suppress the evidence, and in admitting it at
the trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals overruled errors
assigned to the District Court's action and affirmed the
.judgment
The assertion is that the warrant is void for failure to
observe the statutory requirement that it state the "par' These counts were based on U. S. Code, Tit. 27, §§ 12 and 39.

ticular grounds or probable cause" for issuance; and for
the further reason that it is based on affidavits which do
not "set forth the facts tending to 'establish the grounds
of the application or probable cause for believing that
they exist." ' We need not consider the alleged defect of
the warrant, as we think the objection to the affidavits
well taken, and the warrant consequently without lawful
foundation.
Two affidavits were made before the commissioner.
One purported to state the facts; the other merely asserted a belief that the statements in the first were true,
and is clearly insufficient. Byars v. United States, 273
U. S. 28.
So far as material, the more detailed affidavit states
that "on or about October 14, 1931, he (affiant) went
around and about the premises hereinafter described and
saw persons haul cans, commonly used in handling whisky,
and what appeared to be corn sugar up to and into the
place and saw the same car or truck haul similar cans,
apparently heavily loaded away from there and smelled
odors and fumes of cooking mash coming from the place,
and he says there is a still and whisky mash on the
premises."
Pursuant to the process issued officers seized a still, its
appurtenances, and 350 gallons of whisky, and these were
offered and admitted in evidence at the trial.
Section 25 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act'
provides: "No search warrant shall issue -to search any
prirate dwelling occupied as such unless it is being used
for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, or unless it
'Section 25 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act (U. S. C.,
Tit. 27, § 39) authorizes the issuance of a search warrant in accordance
with the terms of the Act of June 15, 1917 (U. S. C., Tit. 18, §§'613- 616). The matter quoted as to affidavits is contained in § 615, and

is in part used for some business purpose such as a store,
shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding house."
The affidavit fails to state the place to be searched
is not a private dwelling, and the record affirmatively
shows it was, At-most the deposition charges the manufacture of whisky; n9 averment of sale is made; indeed
no facts are given from which sale, on or off the premises
described, necessarily is to be inferred. The court below,
however, held that the facts set forth warranted a belief
that the dwelling was being used as headquarters for the
merchandising of liquor. This was deemed a sufficient
compliance with the statutory permission for search of a
dwelling if "used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating
liquor."
The broad construction of the act by the Court of Appeals unduly narrows the guaranties of the Fourth
Amendment, in consonance with which the statute was
passed. Those guaranties are to be liberally construed
to prevent impairment of the protection extended. Boyd
v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 635; Gouled v.. United
States, 255 U. S. 298, 304; Go-Bart Co.v. United States,
282 U. S. 344, 357. Congress intended, in adopting seotion 25 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act, to
preserve, not to encroach upon, the citizen's right to be
immune from unreasonable searches and seizures, and we
should so construe the legislation as to effect that
purpose.
A search warrant may issue only upon evidence which
would be competent in the trial of the offense before a
jury (Giles v. United States, 284 Fed. 208; Wagner v.
United States, 8 F. (2d) 581); and would lead a man of
prudence and, caution to believe that the offense has been.

Tested by these standards the affidavit was insufficient.

The process should have been quashed, and the articles
seized delivered to the petitioner. Their admission as
evidence was error, and the judgment must be reversed.

MISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 10. Argued October 17, 1932.-Decided November 7, 1932."
An alien seaman who had entered the United States irregularly in
1923, but under the three year limitation of the Immigration Act
of 1917 was not subject to deportation, signed in 1929 as a member
of the crew of an American ship for a round-trip voyage to Germany.' Some time after his return he was arrested for deportation
as an alien who had remained here in violation of the Act of 1924.
Held:
1. Upon his return in 1929 the alien came from a place outside
the United States within the meaning of the immigration laws, and
his arrival was an entry into this country notwithstanding he was a
member of the crew of an American ship which had made a roundtrip voyage. P. 132.
2. That he entered without permission does not entitle him as
an alien seaman to more than the sixty days stay allowed by the
regulations. P. 132.
3. The statutory duty of the master to bring back to the United
States a seaman who signs for a round-trip voyage could not make
his entry in 1929 lawful nor confer on him the right to remain here
permanently. Pp. 132-133.
4. The fact that he could not have been deported at the time -he
signed for the round-trip voyage could not make his status upon
