U. S. 538, to review an admiralty decree

modifying an assessment of damages in a collision case.
Mr. Leonard J. Matteson, with whom Mr. Oscar R.
Houston was on the brief, for petitioner.
If the petitioner had maintained the third tugboat as
a "spare" and had used it as a substitute in the emergency, there is no doubt that it would have been entitled
to recover the reasonable hire of a boat of like capacity
as the proper measure of damages for loss of use of the
vessel injured. The Cayuga, 7 Blatchf. 385, affirmed,

It was merely a,matter of convenience which plan was
adopted.

Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General St. Lewis, and Messrs. Whitney North
Seymour, J. Frank Staley, and Wim. H. Riley, Jr., were on
the brief, for the United States.
Petitioner has been fully compensated for the cost of
repairing its tugboat, and has failed to prove any other
damage. Under settled principles, the disallowance of
the item for demurrage was clearly correct. The Potomac, 105 U. S. 630.
Since the decision in The Conqueror, 166 U. S.110, the
federal courts have consistently held that, in order to recover demurrage for detention of vessels injured in a collision, it is necessary to show that loss has actually been
sustained as a result of the detention. The North Star,

The basis of applications of the "spare boat" doctrine
is that the owner of the I.jured vessel, anticipating a
time when the vessel would not be available for regular
service because of a collision or other causes, had acquired
and maintained an additional vessel for such emergencies
so that he would not be required to hire a boat at the
regular market rate to take the place of the injured vessel.

172

Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

Since he would have had to pay for such hire if he had
not gone to the expense of maintaining the extra boat, it
is thought proper that those who caused the regular boats
to be retired from service because of collisions should bear
a part of the cost, commensurate with their fault, of the
spare boats maintained to do the work of the regular vessels during such repair periods. The damages usually
allowed where a spare boat is used are based upon the
market rate of hiring a boat during the period of repairs.
These cases fall within the principles laid down in The
Conqueror, 166 U. S. 110, that the loss arising from detention must be definitely shown, for the owner is actually Out of pocket for the cost of acquiring and maintaining the spare boat used in such emergencies. Thus
damages have been proved with reasonable certainty.
Here the additional cost of overtime .operation has not
been proven. And to extend the "spare boat" doctrine
to such cases would be to destroy its basis, namely, that
recoverable loss must be proven with reasonable certainty.
Even if damages for detention were recoverable on any
theory the award was grossly excessive.
MR. JusTicE C Dnozo delivered the opinion of the Court.
On September 30, 1920, the dredge Raritan, belonging
to the United States, collided in New York harbor with
the steam tug Integrity, belonging to the petitioner. A
libel in admiralty to recover the damages to the tug was
filed by the petitioner in conformity with an act of Congress whereby the United States consented to be sued.
Act of February 16, 1925; c. 241, 43 Stat. 1566. A crosslibel for damages to the dredge was filed by the government. The trial court held both vessels at fault, and
determined that the damages to each should be equally
apportioned between the owners. A Special Commissioner was appointed to ascertain the damages and report.

BROOKLYN EASTERN TERMINAL v. U. S. 173
170

Opinion of the Court.

The controversy hinges uppn an item of demurrage.
As to the repair bills ($26,114.57 for the Integrity and
$2,230 for the Raritan), as well as some other items, the
parties are now at one. The conflict between them, once
waged along a wider front, has narrowed to a single
point. The District Court, confirming the Commissioner's
report, allowed demurrage to the petitioner at the rate
of $150 a day, the market hire of another tug, during the
seventy-eight days when the Integrity was withdrawn for
repairs. This item ($11,700) the Circuit -Court of
Appeals excluded. 54 F. (2d) 978. A writ of certiorari
has brought the case here.
The petitioner was in the business of towing car-floats
for railroads between points in New York harbor. It did
not use its boats for hire generally. Its business was sufficient to occupy three tugs during regular working hours
in the transfer of railroad cars from one point to another.
When the Integrity was laid up, the .petitioner did not
hire an extra tug as a substitute for the one disabled.
Instead, it used its two other tugs overtime, and thus
kept down the cost while doing business as before. The
same crews were employed; but if extra wages were paid,
the amount has not been proved. Extra wear and tear
there may have been; but there is nothing in the record
to indicate how much. Indeed, the witness for the petitioner frankly stated that the loss, if any, from that cause
was too uncertain to be measured. The. award for demurrage allowed by the District Court and disallowed by the
Court of Appeals was not made upon the basis of depreciation of the boats in use. It is measured by expenses that
in fact never were incurred, but that might have been
incurred and charged to the respondent if the necessities
of the business had been something other than they were.
Our decision may not overleap the limitations of the
record. To dispose of the case before us we do not need
to hold that through the use of the other vessels the pos-

sibility of all demurrage has been excluded by an inexorable rule of law. Other courts have held in situations not
dissimilar that demurrage may be measured by the interest on the capital value tied up in the disabled boat during the term of disability and thus unfruitfully employed.
The Susquehanna, [1926] A. C. 655, 663, 664; cf. The
Greta Holme, [1897] A. C. 596. To approve or disapprove that measure is unnecessary here, for the record
does not contain the figures that would enable us to apply it.. Even now the petitioner is not seeking for a
judgment upon that basis, nor indeed upon any other
basis than the one adopted at the trial. The question
narrows itself to this, whether the full-time hire of an
extra boat must be charged to the respondent as damage
flowing from the collision when there was no need of such
a boat to keep the business going, and none in fact was
used or paid for. Is an award upon that basis either
erroneous in law or extravagant in fact?
.Erroneous and extravagant we think it must be held
to be. The Conqueror, 166 U. S. 110, 125, 134; The Susquehanna, supra; cf. The North Star, 151 Fed. 168; The
Wotsum, 14 F. (2d) 371; Cuyamel Fruit Co. v. Nedland,
19 F..(2d) 489; Newtown Creek Towing Co. v. New York
City, 23 F. (2d) 486; The Glendola, 47 F. (2d) 206. The
disability of a vessel will iiot sustain demurrage at the
rate of the value of her hire unless an award at such a
rate can be seen to be reasonable when the disability is
viewed in the setting of the circumstances. The Conqueror,'supra. Only when thus enlightened can we choose
the yardstick most nicely adjusted to be a measure of
reparation, in some instances, no doubt, the hire of another vessel, in other instances, it may be, a return upon
the idle "capital (The Susquehanna, supra), in others
something else. Only then indeed can we know whether
the interference with profit or enjoyment is to be ranked

as substance or as shadow. The vessel may have been
employed in a business of such a nature that for the
avoidance of loss there is need of the employment of a
substitute. In such circumstances the fair value of the
hire may be an element of damage, and this whether the
substitute is actually procured or not. Cf. The Lagonda,
44 Fed. 367; The Mediana, [1900] A. C. 113; Perkins v.
Brown, 132 Tenn. 294; 177 S. W. 1158; Cook v. Packard
Motor Car Co., 88 Conn. 590; 92 Ati. 413. The vessel
may be a yacht, employed for pleasure and not for business. Even then, in the judgment of many courts, the
value of the use may be considered by the triers of the
facts in fixing the recovery if there has been a substantial impairment of that enjoyment for which such vessels
are maihtained. The Lagonda, supra; Cook v. Packard
Motor Car Co., supra; Banta v. Stamford Motor.Co., 89
Conn. 51, 56; 92 Atl. 665; Perkins v. Brown, supra; Hunt
Co. v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 199 Mass. 220, 235, 236;
85 N. E. 446; The Astrakhan,.[1910] P. 172, 181. There
are .statements in The Conqueror (p. 133) that may be
in conflict with that view, but they were not essential
to the judgment (p. 134), and in the light of later decisions as to the loss of pleasure vehicles are unquestionably
in opposition to a strong current of authority. See cases,
supra. The owner of the Conqueror would not have let
his yacht to any one if there had been no occasion to
repair her, nor during the season that she -wasout of service would he have used her for himself. 166 U.- S. at
p. 134. There was neither interference with profit nor
substantial disturbance of 'enjoyment. The court did
not hold that even then there could be no recovery whatever. Cf. Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., supra, at
p. 596. It held that recovery was excessive when based
on the returns of an imaginary letting. We are to have
regard in every case to the reasonable probabilities of time

and place and circumstance. Demurrage on the basis of
the cost,of a substitute, actual or supposititious, may be no
more than fair indemnity when gains have been lost or
enjoyment seriously disturbed. Demurrage on a like basis
may be so extravagant as to outrun the bounds of reason
when loss of profit has been avoided Without the hire of a
substitute and the disturbance of enjoyment has been
slight or perhaps fanciful. The Conqueror, supra. Cf.
Cook v. PackardMotor Car Co., supra, p. 595; The Susquehanna, [1925] P. 196, 207, affirmed [1926] A. C. 655.
A wide range of judgment is conceded to the triers of the
facts in the choice.of the standard to be applied and in
the method of applying it. Cook v. PackardMotor Car
Co., supra. The choice, however, may not be arbitrary,
nor is the range of judgment without limit. We think
that on the face of this award there is declared a principle of assessment that in the setting of the circumstances
exceeds the bounds of any discretion allowed to the
assessors. In admiralty an appeal to the Court of Appeals is deemed to be a trial de novo. Munson Steamship Line v. Miramar Steamship Co., 167 Fed. 960; Gilchrist v. Chicago Ins. Co., 104 Fed. 566, 571; cf. The
Abbotsford, 98 U. S. 440; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione
Austriaca di Navigazione, 248 U. S. 9, 21; Standard Oil
Co. v. So. Pacific Co., 268 U. S. 146, 155. An assessment
of damages may be corrected if erroneous in point of
law, but also it paay be corrected if extravagant in fact.
The doctrine of the "spare boat" cases is invoked by
the petitioner as decisive in its favor, but we think without avail. Shipowners at times maintain an extra or
spare boat which is kept in reserve for the purpose of
being utilized as a substitute in the contingency of damage to other vessels of the fleet. There are decisions to
the effect that in such conditions the value of the use of
a boat thus specially reserved may be part of the demur-

rage. The Cayuga, 7 Blatch. 385, affirmed 14 Wall. 270,
278; The Favorita,8 Blatch. 539, affirmed 18 Wall. 598,
603; New Haven Steamboat Co. v. The Mayor, 36 Fed.
716, 718; The Emma Kate Ross, 50 Fed. 845; The Providence, 98 Fed. 133. If no such boat had been maintained,
another might have been hired, and the hire charged as an
expense. The result is all one whether the substitute is
acquired before the event or after. The same 'doctrine
has been recognized in the English courts, where a boat
thus held in reserve is known as a standby. The Mediana,
[1900] A. C. 113. In those courts, however; as in our own,
there has been a refusal to extend the doctrine to boats
acquired and-maintained for the general. uses of the business. Just such a state of facts was considered by the
House df Lords in The Susquehanna,supra, a case hardly
to be distinguished from the one at hand. In the speech
by Lord Sumner we are told that "the Admiralty by
prompt effort aid economy in consumption, acting in accordance with their obligation to minimize the damages,managed to get through their work" without the disabled
vessel. "They cannot," he continued (p. 663), "get damages based on the use of a standby when in fact they did
very well without one."
So here. The petitioner was engaged in 'an established
business using tugs for a single purpose. It had no
thought to turn that business into one of a different kind
while this tug was out of service. Mindful of the need
to minimize the damages, it used to the full its available
resources, and was able by special effort to make them do
the work. We are unable to accept the argument that
'the expenses which it saved are to be charged to the
respondent as if they had not been saved at all..
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which
modified the judgment of the District Court is accordingly
Affirmed.
