MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
In.1914 respondent, a New Jersey manufacturing corporation, purchased all the capital stock of the Aluminum
Sales and Manufacturing Company, a New York corporation. From that time until its liquidation, carried on in
1917, the Sales Company was principally engaged in selling goods manufactured by respondent. .In February,
-1918, it was dissolved. The operation of the Sales Coipany reflected net losses during the years 1914, 1915 and
1916, as well as in the year 1917. As a result of the operating losses and the liquidation of the Sales Company,

respondent suffered the loss of certain sums advanced to
the Sales Company, and of the total investment in its
.stock.
For 1917 the two corporations filed separate returns for
computation of the normal income tax, and a consolidated
return for the purposes of the excess profits tax. In its
separate return respondent claimed, and the Commissioner allowed, deduction of an qggregate loss made up of
respondent's advances to the Sales Company, and the cost
of its stock, less the value of equipment and good will
realized on its liquidationi This loss, reduced by the 1917
operating loss of the Sales Company, was deducted from
gross income in the consolidated return. The Commissioner's refusal to allow the deduction was sustained by
.the Board of Tax Appeals, 22 B. T. A. 1, whose determination was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit, 56 F. (2d) 568. The Court o f Appeals held that
respondent's affiliation with the Sales Company was ended
by the liquidation in 1917, so that the loss was suffered
"outside the period of affiliation," and that in any case,
as the loss did not result from an "intercompany" transaction, it could be deducted in the consolidated return.
This Court granted certiorari, to resolve An alleged conflict
with the decision of the Court of Claims in Utica Knitting
Co. v. United States, 68 Ct. Cls. 77, and see Autosales
Corporationv. Commissioner, 43 F. (2d) 931, 933.
Title II of the Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 302,
imposed a war excess profits tax in addition to the normal
tax upon the income of corporations. The statute made
no provision for consolidated returns by affiliated corporations, but Articles 77 and 78 of Treasury Regulations 41,
adopted purs~uant to the Act, did authorize the Commissioner to require affiliated cotporations, including those,
the stock of one of-which was owned by another, to file a
consolidated return of net. income and invested capital.
And -§ 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 319,

Opinion of the Court.

provided that for the purpose of determining excess profits
taxes the Revenue Act of 1917 "shall be construed to impose the taxes therein mentioned upon the basis of consolidated returns of net income and invested capital in
the c4se of domestic corporations and domestic partnerships that were affiliated during the calendar year 1917." 1
The purpose of requiring consolidated returns by affiliated corporations was, as the Government cot/tends, to
impos the war profits tax, according to true net income
and Ivested capital of what was, in practical effect, a
single' business enterprise, even though conducted by
means of more than one corporation. Primarily, the consolidated-return was to preclude reductioni of the total tax
payable by the business, viewed as a unit, by redistribution of income or capital among the component corporations by means of intercompany transactions. See Handy
& Harman v. Burnet, 284 U. S. 136, 140; Appeal of Gould
Coupler Co., 5 B. T. A. 499, 514-516; cf. Treasury Regulations 41, Art. 77; Treasury Regulations 45, Art. 631.
It is not denied that the two corporations became affiliated when respondent acquired all the capital stock-of the
Sales Company. But on the basis of the finding of the
Board of Tax Appeals that the Sales Company was chiefly
engaged during -1917 in closing up its business preparatory
to formal dissolution, which took place in February, 1918,
that -all its assets and liabilities were disposed of by the
end of 1917, and that it did not do any business after that
date, petitioner argues that the affiliation of the two companies was terminated by the liquidation.
'Subsequently to 1917, affiliated corporations were required to file
such a return for all purposes for any taxable year prior to January
1, 1922 (§ 240, Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Sfat. 1057, 1081; § 240,
Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 260). Thereafter, it became
optional whether to file a consolidated or separate returns. (§ 240,
Revenue Act of 1921; § 240 Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat.'253, 288;
§ 240 Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 46; §§ 141, 142, Revenue Act
of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 831, 832.)

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

Since complete stock ownership is made the test of
-affiliation applicable here under Article 77 of Treasury
- Regilations 41 and § 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921, no
ground is apparent for saying that the corporations ceased
to. be affiliated, merely because, without change of corporate control, one of them was being liquidated. The
findings do not reveal that the liquidation of the Sales
Company was completed, that it ceased to do any business
or to function as a corporation before the end of 1917.
Neither statute nor regulations recognize that affiliation
may be terminated by the mere fact that*such liquidation
is being carried on, and the reasons for requiring the consolidated return may be quite as valid during that liquidation as before. During that period the unitary character of-the business enterprise is not necessarily ended and
intercompany manipulations are not precluded.
In the present case, even though the affiliation continued, it does not follow as a matter of law that the loss was
not rightly deducted in the consolidated return. Section
12, Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 767, governs the
computation of the excess profits tax under § 206, Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 305. That section and the
regulation under it (see Article 147, Treasury Regulations
33, 1918 ed.), direct that taxable net income of a corporate taxpayer shall be ascertained by deducting, from
gross income, losses sustained within the year. It is conceded that the loss of respondent's advances to the Sales
Company and. the investment in its stock was sustained
in 1917, was deductible therefore, if at all, in that year,
and might properly have been deducted by respondent in
a separate return, if a separate return had been permissible. But the Government insists that the loss cannot
be deducted in the mandatory consolidated return for 1917
because it occurred as the result of "intercompany" transactions.

BURNET v. ALUMINUM GOODS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

We need not decide whether the loss resulted from intercompany transactions within the meaning of the regulations under later statutes 2 which broadly exclude from
the consolidated returns profit or loss upon .all such transactions. For neither the Revenue Act of 1917, nor § 1331
of the Revenue Act of 1921, nor the regulations under
them 3 prescribe specifically the method of making up
the consolidated .return or require the elimination from
the computation of the tax of the results of all intercompany transactions. Article 77 of Treasury Regulations 41
required every corporation to describe in its- return " all
its intercorporate relationships with other corporations,
with which it is affiliated," and to "furnish such information in relation thereto as will enable the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compute the amount of the
tax properly due from each corporation on the basis of
an equitable and lawful accounting." Article 78 authorizes the Commissioner to require consolidated returns of
affiliated corporations "wherever necessary to more equitably determine invested capital or taxable income," and
provides that " the total tax will be computed in the first
instande as a unit on the basis of the consolidated return."
These provisions plainly do not lay down any rigid rule
of accounting to be applied to consolidated returns which
would exclude from the computation of taxable income
the results of every intercompany transaction, regardless
'See art. 637, 864 of Treasury Regulations 45 under the Revenue
Act of 1918; art. 635,: 864 of Treasury Regulations 62 under the
Revenue Act of 1921; art. 636 of Treasury Regulations 65 under the
Revenue Act of 1924; art. 635 of Treasury Regulations 69 under the
Revenue Act of 1926; art. 734 of Treasury Regulations 74 and art.
15, 31, 37 (a), 38 (b) of Treasury Regulations 75 under the Revenue
Act of 1928.

the Revenue Act of 1917.

a its effect upon the capital or the net gains or losses
of the business of the affiliated corporations'. Instead,
they merely disclose the purpose underlying regulations
and statite to prevent, through the exercise of a comnion ,ower of control, any intercompany manipulation. which would distort invested capital or the true
income of the unitary business carried on by the affiliated
corporations. Hence, no method of accounting, in calculating taxable income upon the consolidated return, can
be upheld; which would withhold froIn the taxpayer all.
benefit of deduction for losses actually sustained and deductible under the sections governing the. computation
of taxable income, and which at the same time would not
further, in some way) the very purpose for which consolidated returns are required.
Such, we think, is the effect of the method adopted by
the Commissioner.- The Sales Company suffered losses
during the years 1914, 1915 and 1916 which could not be
deducted in its-separate returns for those years, because
they were net losses, and which could not be deducted
from the profits, of the parent company -because there was
no consolidated return in those yeats. While it may be
assumed that.those losses affected the value of the stock
owned by the parent company, the loss of its investment
in the sto&k of the Sales Company and in advances to itcould not be deducted by the parent company in its separate return for those years because the loss had not then
been sustained with such :finality as to permit its deduction under the applcable statute and regulations. So far
as the loss from operation 6f the Sales Company in earlier
years contributed to respondent's capital loss in 1917,' deduction of the latter in. the consolidated return involved
no double deduction of losses of the business of the two
companies during the period of their affiliation. As respondent's total loss in 1917 was reduced, before deduction. in the consolidated return, by the amount of the

operating loss of the Sales Company for that year, there
was. no duplication of any losses accrued or sustained in
that year,
The loss was a real one, buffered by. respondent as a
separate corporate.entity, and it was equally a loss suffered
by the single business carried on by the two corporations
during the period of their affiliation, ultimately reflected
in the 1917 loss 6f capital invested in that business.
While -equitable principles of accounting applied. to the
calculation of the net income of the business, unit do not
permit deduction of the loss twice, they do require its
deduction once. Hence, the loss was deductible in 117
under the statute and regulations controlling computation
of taxable income, and its deduction is not forbidden by
the regulations applicable to the consolidated return. Articles 77 and 78 of Treasury Regulations 41 would, indeed;,
require the eliminaion of any losses resulting from inteicompany transactions the inclusion of which would defeat
the purpose of consolidated returns to tax the true income
of the single business of affiliated corporations, calculated
by correct accounting methods. The. deductions claimed
here had no such effect.
