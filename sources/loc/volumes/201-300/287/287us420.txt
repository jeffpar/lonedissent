controlled by a single stockholder. See Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 208, 209; Lynch v. Hornby, 247

. Rev. Stats., § 4282, exempting the vessel-owner from liability to
cargo for loss or damage by fire, "unless such fire is caused by the
... neglect of such owner," means personal negligence of the
owner, or, in case of a corporate owner, negligence of its managing
officers or agents. P. 424.
2. The fire resulted inevitably from conditions in a coal bunker, which
were chargeable to the negligence of the vessel's chief engineer in
storing new coal before sailing, and which rendered her unseaworthy

from the time she left port. Assuming the unseaworthiness could
have been discovered by due diligence, held:
(1) The breach of the owner's implied warranty of seaworthiness
did not bonstitute "neglect" in the sense of the fire statute.
P. 425.
(2) The provisions of the Harter Act, § 3, respecting seaworthiness,
have to do with exemption from liabilities other than for losses by
fire; and that act did not modify or repeal the fire statute. P. 426.
3. Bills of lading incorporating the fire statute and containing clauses
relieving the vessel-owner from liability for losses due to certain
causbs, if the owner had "exercised due diligence to make the
steamer seaworthy,"-held not to have added anything to the personai obligations of the vessel-owner so far as loss from fire is concerned, and not to have waived the statutory immunity in that
regard. P. 428.
4. Rule that vessel-owner's liability on personal contracts is not limited to value of his interest in vessel and freight, held inapplicable
where owner's claim is complete immunity from liability, and where
alleged personal contracts. consisted merely oi bills of lading, executed by railroads and by other steamship companies. P. 429.

The duty to make the ship seaworthy is the primary
and most important duty of the shipowner in every contract of affreightment. The Caledonia, supra.
Failure to see. to it that ordinary care is used to make
the vessel seaworthy on sailing from the loading port is
always negligence of the shipowner himself. Especially is
this true when the shipowner himself has warranted that
at the time of sailing from the loading port the vessel is
in fact seaworthy so far as due diligence can make her so,
and that he, himself, had exercised that diligence. Such
a breach of warranty legally constitutes personal, neglect
and privity. The Soerstad, 257 Fed. 130; Royal Exchangev. Kingsley Navigation Co., (1923) Appeal Cases

nor the insertion of a, clause worded as follows, "This shipment is subject to all the terms and provisions of and all
exemptions from liability contained in . . . § § 4281 and
42S7, each inclusive, of the United States Statutes," reduces or impairs the personal duty imposed by the warranty in a separate and distinct clause in'the bill of lading
that the respondent would supply a vessel which-on sailing
from the loading port would be in fact seaworthy against
fire so far as use of ordinary care in the loading port could
make her so, and that "the owners" of the vessel would
themselves exercise the necessary due diligence to make
the vessel seaworthy. The contract does not authorize the
delegation of that duty.
This w~s a personal contract of the respondent shipowner, for the breach of which it was responisible. The
respondent, through its New York managing agent, held
itself out in New York, the loading port, as a common
carrier, under its corporate name, and personally contracted and warranted through such agent that the vessel
on sailing. Would in fact be seaworthy so far as the exercise of ordinary care could make her so. Pendleton v.

decisions that where, as here, a corporation is doing business elsewhere than at the place where its corporate officers reside or have their office, and has committed or
delegated the conduct of its business at that place to an"

that of the corporation personally.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Earle and Stoddart, Incorporated, and other owners of
cargo shipped on the steamship Galileo, sued'her owner
and operator, Ellerman's Wilson Line, Limited, in the
federal court for southern New York, for breach of contract to deliver at destination. The defendant pleaded
in bar the fire statute, which provides: "No owner of
any vessel shall be liable to answer for or make good
to any person any loss or damage which may happen
to any merchandise whatsoever, which shall be shipped,
taken in, or put on board any such vessel, by reaspn or
by means of any fire happening to or on board the
vessel, unless such fire is caused by the design or neglect
of such owner." Rev. Stat. § 4282, Act of March 3, 1851,
c. 43, § 1, 9 Stat. 635.
The District Court made these findings: Shortly after
the departure from New York coal in a temporary bunker
was found to be afire through spontaneous combustion.
Following appropriate efforts to extinguish the fire, the
vessel sank and practically the entire cargo was lost. The
immediate cause of the loss was the fire, to which no
design or neglect of the owner contributed. The immediate cause of the fire was the condition of the coal at
the time the voyage was commenced, which rendered
the vessel unseaworthy. The sole cause of the unseaworthiness 'was the gross negligence of the ship's chief
engineer in putting a new supply of coal on top of old
coal then known to be heated. The Circuit Court of
Appeals* concurred in these findings and affirmed the
decree which dismissed the libel. 54 F. (2d) 913. This
Court granted certiorari on the ground of conflict of
decisibns. . 286 U. S. 535.
The cargo-owners concede that ordinarily the phrase,
in the fire statute "neglect of such owner" means personal negligence of the owner, or, in case of a corporate,

Opinion of the Court.

owner, negligence of its managing officers or agents; and
that the negligence of the master, chief engineer or other
-ship's officers does not deprive the owner of the statutory
immunity. Walker v. TransportationCo., 3 Wall. 150;
Craig v. Contine.'ital Insurance Co., 141 U. S. 638, 646.
The contention is that the statute does not confer iminunity where the fire resulted from unseaworthiness existing at the commencement of the voyage and *discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care; or, at least, that
the statute does not afford immunity where the owners
warrant by their bills of lading, as it is asserted they have
done here, that they will "exercise due diligence to make
the steamer seaworthy."
First. The fire statute, in terms, relieves the owners
from liability "unless such fire is caused by the design
or neglect of such owner." The statute makes no other
exception from the complete immunity granted. The
cargo-owners do not make the broad contention that the
statute affords no protection to the vessel-owner if the
fire was caused by unseaworthiness existing at the commencement of the voyage.1 Their contention is that it
'Such a contention with respect to the English Act was rejected by
the House of Lords. Louis Dreyfus & Co. v. Tempus Shipping Co.,
[1931] A. C. 726. See also Virginia Carolina Chemical Co. v. Norfoll & N. A. Steam Shipping Co., [1912] 1 K. B. 229; Ingram
& Royle v. Services Maritimes du Tr~port, 11914] 1 K. B. 541.
Compare Royal Exchange Assurance v. Kingsley Navigation Co.,
[1923] A. C. 235, construing the Canadian Act. The English Act
relieves the shipowner from liability for loss from fire where the
loss occurred " without his actual fault or privity." Merchants Shipping Act, 1894, § 502; 57 & 58 Viet., o. 60. The original English fire
statute of 1786, 26 Geo. III, 6. 86, which was the model for the
American statute of 1851, contained no exception for the owner's fault
or privity; the American enactment was a deliberate departure in
that respect. The bill as originally reported contained an exception
only for the "design" of the owner, but this was amended to read
"design or neglect." See 23 Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 715.

Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

does not relieve the owner if the .unseaworthiness was
discoverable by due diligence. The argument is that the
duty of the owner to make the ship seaworthy before
starting on her voyage is non-delegable and if the unseaworthiness could have been discovered by due diligence
there was necessarily neglect of the vessel-owner.
In support of this contention,, the cargo-owners place
some reliance upo n The Edwin I. Morrison,153 U. S. 199,
'The Caledonia, 157 U. S. 124, and The Carib Prince,
170 U. S. 655. Those cases enunciate the rule that in
every contract of affreightment there is, unless otherwise expressly stipulated, an implied warranty of seaworthiness at the commencement of the voyage. The
warranty is absolute that the ship is in fact seaworthy
at that time, and the liability does not depend upon the
knowledge or ignorance, the care or negligence of the shipowner or charterer. Obviously, those cases lend no support to the contention that breach of the implied warranty
of seaworthiness constitutes "neglect" of the vesselowner under the fire statute.2
The cargo-owners rely chiefly upon InternationalNavigation Co. v. Farr& Bailey Mfg. Co., 181 U. S. 218, and
The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378. Those cases involved the
construction of the Harter Act; and the language there
-employed is different. The Harter Act provides in § 3
that the vessel-owner shall not be liable if he." shall
-exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all
,Tegpects seaworthy." And under thai Act the requireCompare also Christopherv. Grueby, 40 F. (2d) 8, 12-13, cited

in behalf of the cargo-owners, which deals with the liability of the
"shipowner to seAmen for failure to provide a seaworthy vessel; and
"Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. v. Gutradt Co., 10 F. (2d) 769, likewise cited, which deals with the responsibility of the shipowner, apart
from~tatutory exemption, for Ioss arising from the default of a ship-

builder on a contract to repair.

Opinion of the Court,

ment of due diligence is not atisfied if there is negligence
on the part of any of the ship's employees. -International
Navigation Co. v. Farr & Bailey Mfg. Co., supra. But
the Act does not purport to create any general duty on
the part of shipowners: Its requirement of due diligence
is imposed as a condition of securing immunity from
liability for certain kinds of losses, like those due to
errors in navigation or management. That the provisions of the Harter Act do not refer to liability for
losses arising from fire is made clear by § 6 which declares
that the Act "shall not be held to modify or repeal §§
4281, 4282, and 4283 of the Revised Statutes,"-§ 4282
being the fire statute. The courts have been careful not
to thwart the purpose of the fire statute by interpreting
as "neglect" of the owners the breach of what in other
connections is held to be a non-delegable duty. 3 Nothing
'In all the cases where immunity from liability for damage by fire
was held to be lost because of neglect of the owners, the courts have
based their finding of neglect on the action of the owners or managing agents, or upon their failure to see that action was taken where
it was their duty to act. The Elizabeth Dantzler,263 Fed. 596; Hines
v. Butler, 278 Fed. 877; Williams S. S. Co. v: Wilbur, 9 F. (2d) 622;
Arkell & Douglas v. United States, 13 F. (2d) 555; Bank Line v.
Porter,25 F. (2d) 843; Petitionof SinclairNavigation C6, 27 F. (2d)
606; United States v. Charbonnier,45 F. (2d) 174; The Older, 1 F.
Supp. 119. In The Etna Maru, 20 F. (2d) 143, the District Court
was of opinion that the fire statute did not confer immunity where
the loss was due to unseaworthiness existing at the beginning of the
voyage. As an alternative ground of decision, however, the court
held that the vessel-owner had not overcome a presumptiofi of personal neglect, arising from the fact of unseaworthiness. Oh appeal
the case was affirmed, 33 F: (2d) 232, but apparently on the ground
that the fire statute, like the statutes limiting the extent of liability,
leaves the owner liable, in any event, up to the value of. the ship.
But compare The Rapid Transit, 52 Fed. 320, 321. Insofar as the
decision rests on the ground advanced by the cargo-owners here, it
bannot be approved,

contained in the opinion of this Court in The Malcolm
Baxter, Jr., 277 U. S. 323, is to be taken as indicating a
different view.
Second. No provision in any bill of lading deprives the
vessel-owner of the protection given by the fire statute.
There are 238 bills of lading on 18 different forms. In
no bill of lading is there an express warranty of seaworthiness. In each, there is a provision expressly incorporating the fire statute. Many of the bills of lading contain
also this.provision: "It is mutually agreed that . . . the
carrier shall not be liable, as carrier or otherwise, for
any loss, damage, delay or default, whether occurring
during transit or before, . . . occasioned by fire or flood,
from any cause or wheresoever occurring; . . . by explosion, bursting of boilers, breakage of shafts, of any
latent defect in hull, machinery, or appurtenances, or
unseaworthiness of the steamer, whether existing at the
time of shipment, or at the beginning of the voyage, provided the owners have exercised due diligence to make
the steamer seaworthy; . , ." So far as loss.from fire is
concerned, the quoted provision leaves the area of personal neglect unchanged, adding nothing to the obligations of the vessel-owner. And in view of the express
incorporation of -the fire statute in the bill of lading, the
provision is not to be construed as a waiver of the
statutory immunity for loss by fire.
'Compare The Strathdon, 101 Fed. 600, 602; The Hoffmans, 171
Fed. 455, 462-463; The Yungay, 58 F. (2d) 352, 357; D'Utassy v.
Mallory Steamship Co., 162 App. Div. 410, 412-414; 147 N. Y. S.

EARLE & STODDART v. WILSON LINE. 429
420

Opinion of the Court.

Third. There was no pergonal contract of the vesselowner superseding the fire statute. The cargo-owners
invoke the rule announced in Pendleton v. Benner'Line,
246 U. S. 353, and Luckenbach v. McCahanSugar Refining
Co., 248 U. S. 139. Those cases have no application here.
They declare that the statutes limiting the amount of
liability of a shipowner to the amount or value of his
interest in the vessel and her freight then pending (Act of
March 3, 1851, c. 43, § 3, Rev. Stat. § 4283; Act of June
26, 1884, c. 121, § 18, 23 Stat. 53, 57) do not apply to
personal contracts of the owner.' Here the inquiry is not
whether there was a "personal contract," on which the
shipowner can be held to the full amount of the loss, but
whether he can be held liable at'all. He catnot be held
liable unless by agreement, or otherwise, he has waived
the benefit of the fire statute. The only basis for the
claim of waiver is the bill of lading. What has already
been said concerning their provisions disposes of that
inquiry.
Moreover, the rule announced ii* the Pendleton and
Luckenbach cases has been applied by this Court only
to private charter parties executed by the owner. The
bills of lading, which are said to contain "personal contracts," were not executed by the respondent or by any
of its officers or managers. They were given, in large
part, by agents of railroads or other steamship companies
and are to be regarded merely as ship's documents. Compare Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cambria Steel Co.,
249 U. S.334, 336.
The District Court was right in dismissing the libel,
and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
