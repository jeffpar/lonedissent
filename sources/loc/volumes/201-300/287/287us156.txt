AMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BALDWIN ET AL.*
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF IDAHO.

No. 3.

Argued October 13, 14, 1932.-Decided November 14, 1932.

1. Where a claim of violation of federal right, based on the alleged
action of the trial court in entering judgment without notice and
an opportunity to be heard, was raised f()r the first time upon
petition for rehearing (denied without opinion) in the state supreme court, although the same ground of objection had been
raised throughout the proceedings but solely as a question of state
law, a writ of certiorari to review the judgment will be dismissed
for failure to make seasonably the federal claim. P. 162.
2., Where, upon the claim of a party that judgment was entered
against him without jurisdiction in a state court, there is an adequate state remedy available, which he invokes and pursues to final
judgment, the remedy by suit in the federal court is barred. P. 164.
3. Where a judgment is attacked as having been entered without
jurisdiction, an appeal from an order on motion to vacate, made on
a general appearance, was effective to confer jurisdiction upon the
state supreme court to determine whether the trial court had
jurisdiction. P. 165.
4. The full faith and credit clause applies to judicial proceedings
of a state court drawn in question in an independent proceeding
in the federal courts. P. 166.
5. Principles of res judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction as
well as to other issues. P. 166.
6. Principles of res judicata may apply though proceeding was begun
by motion. P. 166.
7. Decision of state supreme court wherein question of jurisdiction
of trial court to enter judgment was adjudicated on appeal in a
proceeding begun by motion to set the judgment aside, held bar
to proceeding in federal court to enjoin enforcement of judgment
for want of jurisdiction. Pp. 166-167.
.8. While due process requires that one against whom liability on a
supersedeas bond is sought to be enforced shall have opportunity
to present every available defense, this need not be before entry
of judgment, and a State may constitutionally provide for such
a hearing by an appeal after entry of judgment. P. 168.

WRITS of certiorari, 286 U. S. 536, 537, to review judgments of the Supreme Court of Idaho and the Circuit
Court of Appeals, involving the validity of a judgment

American Surety Co.
The surety company did not consent in advance that a.
judgment might be rendered against it for the amount
of the judgment against Anderson, if that should be
affirmed.
As the Supreme Court of Idaho expressly refused to
construe either the statute or supersedeas undertaking,
this Court is free to construe them, as an original proposition, according to its own views. Merchants National
Bank v. Richmond, 256 U. S. 635, 638; Carlson v. Washington, 234 U. S. 103, 106.
From the bond itself one would never dream that there
was a $19,573.70 judgment against Anderson; but only
that there was such a judgment against the Singer Co.
The ex parte judgment of June 23, 1930 against the
surety company was absolutely void for lack of summons
or notice to it. National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195

show that no such personal jurisdiction existed. Chicago
Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25, 29.
The Supreme Court of Idaho can not deprive the
surety company of its right to federal protection under the
due process clause by holding that the surety company
should have appealed from, instead of moving to set
aside, the June 23d judgment, and that having mistakenly
pursued an allegedly erroneous procedure for relief, it is
remediless.
Under the due process clause, the surety company was
entitled to be heard before the judgment was rendered,
so that it would have n opportunity to get into the
record whatever it deemed essential for its protection,
Missouri v. North, 271 U. S. 40, 42; Dartmouth College

U. S.312, 332; Hurtado v. California,110 U. S.516, 535.
A hearing limited to an ex parte record,, where the injured party had no opportunity to be heard or present
his proofs, does not afford due process.
The federal courts have jurisdiction to enjoin judgments in the state courts the enforcement of which-would
be unconscionable. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254

court for $22,357.21 and interest, on a supersedeas bond.
No. 3, which is here on certiorari to the.Supreme Court
of Idaho, brings the record of the cause in which that
judgment was entered. 286 U. S. .536. No. 21 is here
on certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the decree
of the federal court for Idaho denying the Surety Company's application to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment and dismissing the bill. 286 U. S. 537. In each
case it is claimed that the judgment is void under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The bond was given upon the appeal of the Singer
Sewing Machine Company and Anderson, its employee,
to the Supreme Court of Idaho from a judgment for
$19,500 recovered against, them by the Baldwins in an
Idaho district court for an automobile collision. The
defendants had given a joint notice of appeal " from that
certain judgment . . . against the defendants and each
of them, and from the whole thereof." Pursuant to the
statutes (Idaho Comp. Stat. §§ 7154 and 7155), two bonds
were given by the Surety Company, both being executed
only by it. One was in the sum of $300 for costs; the
other was the supersedeas bond in the sum of $25,000
here in question, copied in the margin.' It recited that

Opinion of the Court.

The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment as to Anderson and reversed it as to the Singer Company, Baldwin v.
Singer Sewing Machine Co. and Anderson, 49 Idaho 231;
287 Pac. 944. Upon the filing of the remittitur the appropriate new judgment against Anderson was entered in the
trial court. That judgment having remained unpaid
more than thirty days, the Baldwins, without giving notice
to either of the original defendants or to the Surety Company, moved the trial court to enter judgment against the
latter. On June 23, 1930, judgment was so entered
against the Surety Company in the sum of $22,357.21 and
interest, with a provision "that the plaintiffs have execution therefor."
The Surety Company concedes that by executing the
supersedeas bond it became, by the laws of Idaho, a party
to the litigation; I and that if the effect of the bond was
to stay the judgment as against Anderson, conseiit had
thereby been given to the entry of judgment without
notice and the judgment would be unassailable. Cf.
Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., 243 U. S. 273,
279. Its contention is that the bond, properly construed,
'The Idaho statute was so construed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in United States Fidel. & Guar. Co. V.
FortMisery Highway Dist., 22 F. (2d) 369, 373, and in Empire StateIdaho-Mining & Developing Co. v. Hanley, 136 Fed. 99. See also

did not stay the judgment as against Anderson, but solely
as against the Singer Company; that hence, the Surety
Company had not consented to the entry of a judgment
against it upon Anderson's failure to pay; and that since
the judgment against it was entered without giving it
notice and the opportunity of a hearing on the construction and effect of the bond, .the judgment is void under
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
First. The certiorari granted in No. 3 to review the
judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Idaho on
May 2, 1931 (50 Idaho 606; 299 Pac. 341) must be dismissed for failure to make seasonably the federal claim.
The proceedings culminating in that judgment were these.
On June 26, 1930, three days after the entry by the Idaho
district court of judgment against the Surety Company
on the supersedeas bond, it filed a motion in that court
to vacate and set aside the judgment. The grounds there
urged in support of the motion were wholly state grounds.
They were that the judgment was void, because there
had been no breach of condition of the bond, properly
construed; that the judgment had been entered without
notice to either the Surety Company or the Singer Company; and that the enforcement of the judgment would
be contrary to good conscience and equity. After hearing arguments on the motion, the Idaho district court
ordered that the judgment be vacated and set aside, and
that the execution issued pursuant thereto be quashed.
The Baldwinsappealed to the Supreme Court of Idaho;
and upon thepresentation of their appeal no federal question was raised by either party. The Supreme Court, on
May 2, 1931, reversed the order vacating the judgment.
It declared that the only issue before the trial court on
motion to vacate was its own jurisdiction to render the
judgment against the Surety Company on the supersedeas
undertaking; that such jurisdiction existed by virtue of
the Suret3i Company's execution of the undertaking in

AMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BALDWIN.
156

Opinion of the Court.

the cause; that the question which had necessarily been
presented was: "Did the Surety Company, in its undertaking, become a party liable for every part of the judgment appealed from which might be affirmed by the supreme court, or did it stipulate only as to such judgment
or part thereof as might be affirmed against the Singer
Sewing Machine Company "; that the trial court thus had
the power and duty to construe the bond; that "whether
it decided right or wrong its decision was a judgment
which could be reviewed for error, if there was error, only
by" the Supreme Court on appeal; and that the alleged
error could not be raised on motion to vacate. 50 Idaho
609, 614-616; 299 Pac. 341.
The Surety Company petitioned for a rehearing. In
that petition, besides reiterating several of its previous
contentions, it urged, for the first time, that the rendition
of the judgment on its undertaking violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." The petition
was denied without opinion. The federal claim there
made cannot serve as the basis for review by this Court.
The contention that a federal right had been violated
rests on the action of the trial court in entering judg* The petition to thi Court for a writ of certiorari, although filed
October 30, 1931, was not granted until April 25, 1932, 286 U. S. 536,
action thereon being withheld "awaiting the action of the Supreme

Court of Idaho in the matters pending before it." Journal Sup. Ct.,
October Term 1931, p. 163 (Jan. 11, 1932). The actions referred to
were two further steps taken by the Surety Company in the Idaho
courts to be relieved of the original judgment against it. The first
was a motion to correct, amend and vacate the original judgment.
This motion the trial court overruled, and its order was upheld on
appeal to the Supreme Court of Idaho. 52 Idaho 243; 13 P. (2d)
650, decided July 12, 1932, rehearing denied September 10, 1932.
The second was a direct appeal to the Supreme'Court of Idaho from
the original judgment; this appeal was dismissed because taken more
than 90 days after the entry of the judgment appealed from. 51

ment without giving notice and an opportunity to be
heard. The same ground of objection had been raised
throughout the proceedings but solely as a matter of
state law. There had been ample opportunity earlier
to present the objection as one arising under the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare Corkran Oil Co.v. Arnaudet, 199 U. S. 182, 193; Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal,
251 U. S. 179, 181; Live Oak Water Users' Assn. v. Railroad ommn., 269 U. S. 354, 357. This is not a case
where, as in Saunders v. Shaw, 244 U. S. 317, 320, the
federal claim arose from the unanticipated disposition of
the case at the close of tho proceedings in the state Supreme Court. Compare Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron
Metropolitan Park Dist., 281 U. S. 74, 79. Nor is the
federal claim based, as in Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust &
Savings Co.v. Hill, 281 U. S.673, 678, upon the unanticipated act of the state Supreme Court in giving to a
statute a new construction which threatened rights under
the Constitution. Compare Missouri ex rel. MissouriInsurance Co.v. Gehner, 281 U. S.313, 320.
Second. In No. 21, the Circuit Court of Appeals should
have affirmed the decree of the federal court for Idaho
which denied the Surety Company's application for an
interlocutory injunction and dismissed the bill. For the
federal remedy was barred by the proceedings taken in
the state court which ripened into a final judgment constituting res judicata,.
The Surety 'Company was at liberty to resort to the
federal court regardless of citizenship, because entry of
the judgment without notice, unless authorized by it,
violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, compare National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195
U. S.257; Cooper v. Newell, 173 U. S. 555. -And it was
at liberty to invoke the federal remedy without first pursuing that provided by state procedure. Simon v. Southem Ry. Co., 236 U. S. 115; Atchison, Topeka & Santa

Opinion of the Court.

Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S. 101; Firestone Tire,&
Rubber Co. v..Marlbora Cotton Mills, 282 Fed.. 811, 814.
But an adequate state remedy was available; and having
invoked that and pursued it to fnal judgment, the Surety
Company cannot escape the effect of the adjudication
there. Compare Mitchell v. First National Bank, 180
U. S. 471, 480-481; Lion Bonding Ca. v. Karatz, 262

U. S. 77, 90.
The Supreme Court of Idaho had jurisdiction over the
parties and of the subject matter in order to determine
whether the trial court had jurisdiction. Clearly, the
motion to vacate, made on a general appearance, and
the appeal from the order thereon, were no less effective
to confer jurisdiction for that purpose than were the
special appearance and motion to quash and dismiss held
sufficient in Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Assn.,
283 U. S. 522. And there was an actual adjudication in
the state court of the question of the jurisdiction of the
trial court to enter judgment. The scope of the issues
presented involved an adjudication of that issue. Compare Napa Valley Elec. Co. v. Railroad Commn., 251 U. S.
366; Grubb v. Public Utilities Commn., 281 U. S. 470;
477478. The Supreme Court of Idaho did not refuse to
adjudicate that question when it declined to "construe
the legal effect of the undertaking in question further than
to examine it in aid of determining the sole question of
the court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion
for judgnent thereon." It narrowed the issue, according
to the State procedure, by separating, in *effect, the question of jurisdiction -from that of liability. It held that
the status of the Surety Company as a party to the
litigation, by virtue of its execution of the bond in the
cause, necessarily persisted, although its liability may
have been limited by the terms of the bond. With. the
soundness of the decision we are not here concerned. It
is enough that the court did not, as the Surety Coin-

287 U.S.

pany asserts, reach its decision by merely assuming the
point in issue, or by deeming itself concluded by the fact
that the trial court took jurisdiction. That it did not so
reach its decision is made clear by the opinion itself. We
are thus brought to a consideration of the effect on the
present suit of the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Idaho.
The full faith and credit clause, together with the legislation pursuant thereto, applies to judicial proceedings
of a state court drawn in question in an independent proceeding in the federal courts. Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11;
Act of March 27, 1804, c. 56, § 2; Rev. Stat. § 905; Mills
v. Duryee, 7 Cranch 481, 485; Insurance Co. v. Harris,
97 U. S. 331, 336. -Compare Bradford Electric Light Co.
v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145, 155. The principles of res
judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction as well as to
other issues. Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's
Assn., 283 U. S. 522. They are given effect even where the
proceeding in the federal court is to enjoin the enforcement of a state judgment, if the issue was made and 6pen
to litigation in the original action, or .was determined in
an independent proceeding in the state courts. See Marshall v. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589, 596; Fidelity & Deposit
Co. v. Gaston, Williams & Wigmore, 13 F. (2d) 267, aff'd
per curiam, id., 268.' The principles of rfs judicata may
apply, although the proceeding was begun by motion.
Thus, a decision in a proceeding begun by motion to set
*aside a judgment for want of jurisdiction is, under Idaho
law, res judicata, and precludes a suit to enjoin enforcement of the judgment. Bernhard v. Idaho Bank &
Trust Co., 21 Idaho 598; 123 Pac. 481.1 Since the deci"In Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U- S. 175, the petitioner had
not been allowed to become a party to the prior litigation in the state
court.
The opinion in that case makes it clear that the efftqt of the prior

judgment as a bar does not rest merely on a rule of practice or, where

AMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BALDWIN.
156

167

Opinion of the 'Court.

sion would formally constitute res judicata in the courts
of the state; since it in fact satisfies the requirements of
prior adjudication; and since the constitutional issie as

to jurisdiction might have been presented to the state
Supreme Court and reviewed here, the decision is a bar
to the present suit insofar as it seeks to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment for want of jurisdiction. Cf.
Fidelity Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, 274 U. S. 123,
130-131.
the second proceeding is in equity, on the adequacy of the remedy at
law. The court said: "In this state the appellant had a choice between two remedies, and he chose to file his motion to -vacate the
judgment in the case in which the judgment was rendered upon the
same facts as pleaded in the complaint in the action involved, and
the court, after hearing the motion, decided the facts against the appellant, holding that the judgment was not void, and the 'order so
holding was appealable. But appellant refused to exercise his right
of appeal and brought this suit in equity to enjoin the collection of
said judgment. He had his day in court in that action, and the decision of that motion upon the question of jurisdiction was res adjudicata. The appellant had the right either to attack said judgment by
motion in the originil case or by bringing this action to enjoin or to
have it set aside: If he proceeded by motion, and the court decided
against him, the decision of that question, until reversed upon appeal,
is final and binding on the psrties." 21 Idaho 598, 603-604; 123
Pac. 481.
Compare the effect, under Idaho law, of a decision on a motion to
set aside a judgment because of the mistake, inadvertence' or excusable neglect of the defendant, or to allow an. answer to the merits to
be interposed after judgment where summons was not served personally on the defendant. Motions of' this kind are allowed by express
statute. Idaho Comp. Stat., § 6726. They present a matter for judicial discretion, Mortgage Co. Holland America v. Yost, 39. Idaho 489;
228 Pac. 282; and their determination does not bar a renewal motion.
See Dellwo v. Petersen,34 Idaho 697; 203 Pac. 472. But motions of
this kind are -to be distinguished from those attacking the judgment
as void for want of jurisdiction. Armitage v. Horseshoe Bend Co.,.
Ltd., 35 Idaho 179; 204 Pac. 1073; Shumake v. Shumake, 17 Idaho
649; 107 Pac. 42.

Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

Third. The Surety Company contends in No. 21 that
even if the trial court of the State had jurisdiction, the
federal district court may enjoin the enforcement of the
judgment on the ground that, having been entered without notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the construction of the bond, it lacked due process of law. It is
true that entry of judgment without notice may be a
denial of due process even where there is jurisdiction
over the person and subject matter. But that rule is not
applicable here. For if the bond properly construed
stayed the judgment as against Anderson, the Surety
Company consented to the entry of judgment against it
without notice for his failure to pay. If the bond did
not stay the judgment as against Anderson, the trial
court confessedly erred in entering the judgment on the
bond; In order to contest its liability the Surety Company had the constitutional right to be heard at some time
on the construction of the bond. The state practice-provided the opportunity for such a hearing by an appeal
after the entry of judgment.
The practice prescribed was constitutional. Due process requires that there be an opportunity to present every
available defense; but it need not be before the entry of
judgment. York v. Texas, 137 U. S. 15. Cf. Grant Timber
& Mfg. Co. y. Gray, 236 U. S. 133; Bianchi v. Morales, 262
U. S. 170. See also Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U. S.
589, 596-597; Coffin Bros. & Co. v. Bennett, 277 U. S. 29.
An appeal on the record which included the bond afforded
an adequate opportunity. Thus, the entry of judgment
was consistent with due process of law. We need not
enquire whether its validity may not rest also on the
ground that the Surety Company, by giving the bond,
must be taken to have consented to the state procedure.
Compare United Sirety Co. V. American Fruit Product
Co., 238 U. S. 140, 142; Corn Exchange Bank v. Commissibner, 280 U. S. 218, 223. The opportunity afforded by

AMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BALDWIN.
156

169

Opinion of the Court.

state practice was lost because the Surety Company inadvertently pursued the wrong procedure in the state courts.
Instead of moving to vacate, it should have appealed directl r to the state Supreme Court. When later it pursued
the proper course, the time for appealing had elapsed..
The fact that its opportunity for a hearing was lost because misapprehension as to the appropriate remedy was
not removed by judicial decision until it was too late to
rectify the error, does not furnish the basis for a claim that
due process of law has been denied. Compare O'Neil v.
Northern ColoradoIrrigationCo., 242 U. S. 20, 26. Having invoked the state procedure which afforded the opportunity of raising the issue of lack of notice, the Surety
Company cannot utilize the same issue as a basis for relief
