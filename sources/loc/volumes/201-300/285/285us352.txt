HANDY, COLLECTOR OF-INTERNAL REVENUE,

v. DELAWARE TRUST CO., EXECUTOR,

ET AL.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 546.

Argued February. 26, 1932.-Decided March 21, 1932.

Decided upon the authority of Heiner v. Donnan, ante, p. 312.
CERTIFICATE

from the Circuit Court of Appeals upon an

appeal from a judgment of the District Court, 51 F. (2d)
867, against the Collector on a claim for refund of taxes
alleged to have been illegally exacted.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher, and Messrs. Claude R. Branch,
Sewall Key, A. H. Conner, and Erwin N. Griswold were
on the brief, for Handy, Collector.
Mr. James H. Hughes, Jr., with whom Mr. Frank S.
Bright was on the brief, for the Delaware Trust Co.,
Executor.
The provision in questi6n can not be supported under
the Fifth Amendment if it be construed as a tax directed at
gifts inter vivos. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230;
Guinzburg v. Anderson, 51 F. (2d) 592; Reinecke v.
Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, 347.
It is unconstitutional under the due process clause if it
be construed as aiming a tax at property forming the estate of a deceased person.
Transfers inter vivos not made in contemplation of
death and not intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at death bear no reasonable relationship to the
tax on the transfer of property at death. Milliken v.
United States, 283 U. S. 15; Reinecke v. Northern Trust
Co., 278 U. S. 339; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497;
United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102.

HANDY v. DELAWARE TRUST CO.
352

Argument for Trust Co.

There is no reasonable basis of distinction justifying
the selection of gifts made within two years of death and
exempting those made more than two years prior to
death. Louisville. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277
U. S. 32.
The basis of the tax imposed is the circumstance of the
transmission of property at death. The time of death
is not material. The tax is not laid directly on a transfer
inter vivos. It is laid on the gross estate of the decedent.
The property transferred is not subject to the tax at the
time of the transfer. The property becomes taxable only
if the accident of death occurs within two years of the
transfer. That accident may or may not happen. Cf.
Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, 347;
American Security & Tr. Co. v. Commissioner, 24 B. T. A.
334. The effect of the conclusive presumption of the contested provision is to cause a transfer, which the donor
has the right to make and which is not taxable when made,
to become taxable in the event that the donor dies within
two years from the date of the transfer. It is fundamental
that tax laws operate specifically and definitely. The
tax attempted is highly speculative, depending on that
most unknown of all things, to-wit, the time of death.
Certainly it would be improper to base a tax on the estate
of "A" on the basis of property owned by " B" at the time
of "A's" death. Hoeper v. Tax Commission, 284 U. S.
206; Nichols V. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 542.
If gifts in fact not made in contemplation of death can
not reasonably be classified with transfers testamentary
in character, then Congress for purposes of classification.
can not conclusively presume them to be in contemplation of death, and, without giving the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard as to the actual facts, attribute to arbitrarily presumed facts the legal significance of actual
facts. See Nichols v. Coolidge, supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285 U.S.

Congress has no power to establish rules which under
guise of regulating the presentation of evidence, conclusively presume the ultimate fact upon which a tax is
based, and, without giving an opportunity for a hearing,
impute to the fact so presumed the legal significance of
actual fact. Hoeper v. Tax Commission, 284 U. S. 206;
Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S. 35;
Manley v. Georgia, 279 U. S. 1; McFarland v. American
Sugar Rfg. Co., 241 U. S. 79; Bailey v. Alabama, 219
U. S. 219; Cockrill v. California,268 U. S. 258; Shwab v.
Doyle, 269 Fed. 321; Howard v. Moot, 64 N. Y. 268; In
re Barbour's Estate, 185 App. Div. 445, affirmed, 226
N. Y. 639; Cooley's Const. Lim., 8th ed., p. 768.
The issue is governed by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270
U. S. 230. Following that case, the tax provision has been
held unconstitutional in the following: Hall v. White,
48 F. (2d) 1060, affirmed, 53 F. (2d) 210; Donnan v.
Heiner, 48 F. (2d) 1058, s. c., 285 U. S. 312; Guinzburg v..
Anderson, 51 F. (2d) 592, affirmed, CCA 2, December 7,
1931; American Security & Tr. Co. v. Commissioner, 24
B. T. A. 334, and in this case below, 51 F. (2d) 867, s. c.,
53 F. (2d) 1042.
The Fifth Amendment in its application to the legislation of Congress is similar in scope and effect to the
Fourteenth Amendment in its application to the legislation of the States. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 543.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case, like Heiner v. Donnan, ante, p. 312, is here
on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit. The question submitted is:
"Does the second sentence of section 302 (c) of the
revenue act of 1926 violate the due-process clause of the
fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United
States?"

SMILEY v. HOLM.
Syllabus.

352

In this case, as in Heiner v. Donnan, the decedent,
within two years prior to his death, had made transfers
inter vivos without consideration which were complete
and irrevocable. The commissioner included the value of
the property so transferred in the value of the gross
estate, and assessed a death transfer tax accordingly.
Following a claim for refund and its rejection, the executor brought this action to recover the amount of the
tax attributable to such inclusion. The trial court found
that in fact none of the transfers had been made in contemplation of death, and rendered judgment for the
executor for the amount claimed, on the ground that
ยง 302 (c) violated the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment and was therefore unconstitutional.
Our decision in Heiner v. Donnan requires an affirmative answer to the question submitted.
It is so ordered.

SMILEY v. HOLM, SECRETARY OF STATE.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA.

No. 617. Argued March 16, 17, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.
1. The function of a state legislature in prescribing the time, place
and manner of holding elections for Representatives in Congress
under Constitution, Art. 1, ยง 4, is a law-making function in which
the veto power of the state governor participates if, under the state
constitution, the governor has that power in the making of state
laws. P. 365.
2. The rule giving weight to practical construction is especially
applicable in the case of a constitutional provision which governs
the exercise of political rights and hence is subject to constant and
careful scrutiny. P. 369.
