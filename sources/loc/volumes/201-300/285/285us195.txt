Syllabus.

make nor guarantee mortgages or loans; (4) compensation
for guaranteeing mortgages to be first liens upon titles in
fee; (5) income from mortgage renewals; etc.
The guaranty of payment of the principal and interest
of mortgage loans constitutes insurance. Bowers v. Lawyers Mortgage Co., ante, p. 182. The amounts received
as compensation for insuring title, for guaranteeing that
mortgages are first liens and for guaranteeing payment constitute the larger part of respondent's income.
And, when there are added the fees and charges for examination of title, appraisals, and other services incident
to its insurance business, the total properly assignable
to that business amounts to more than 75 per cent. of
all respondent's income. Undeniably insurance is its
principal business. Indeed, it does not appear that any
substantial part of its transactions was not connected with
or the outgrowth of insurance. The admitted facts
clearly show that in the tax years above mentioned respondent was an "insurance company" within the meaning of that phrase as commonly understood and as used
in the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924. It was taxable
under ยง 246 and therefore exempt from capital stock
taxes.
Judgment affirmed.

1. An ordinary towage contract does not create a bailment, but surrenders to the tug only such control over the tow as is necessary
for the performance of the tug's engagement. P. 200.

3. A suit by the owner of a tow against her tug to recover for an
injury to the tow caused by negligence on the part of the tug is a
suit ex delicto and not ex contractu. P. 201.
4. The tug is not liable as an insurer or as a common carrier. Its

duty is to exercise such reasonable care and maritime skill as,prudent navigators employ for the performance of similar service.
P. 202.
5. In a suit against the tug for injury to the tow, the burden is upon
the tow's owner to show that the injury was caused by a breach of
that duty. Id.
6. The mere fact that the tow was in good order when received by the
tug and in damaged condition when delivered by it does not raise
a presumption of negligence against the tug. Id.
So held where the injury occurred while no one was with the flotilla save the owners of the tug, who could not explain when, how,
or where the injury happened, and where there was nothing about
the injury itself to warrant an inference that it resulted from fault
or negligence on the part of the tug.
7. The burden of proving negligence in such a case is not satisfied
by evidence which leaves the time, place, and cause of the injury
in the realm of conjeefure, and which is as consistent with an
hypothesis that the tug was not negligent as with one that it was.

the southern district of New York against respondent to
recover for injury sustained by the former while being
towed by the latter. The court held that the tug was
a bailee of the tow and that, it having been shown by
the evidence that the former received the latter in good
condition and delivered it damaged without being able to
account for the injury, there was a presumption of negligence on the part of the tug and that she must be held
liable. 35 F. (2d) 1006. The Circuit Court of Appeals
held the towage contract (lid not put the tow in bail to
the tug and that the mere fact of injury created no presumption of negligence, and reversed the decree. 48 F.
(2d) 557.
Petitioner maintains that the tug was bailee for hire
and that, by proving the tug received the tow in good
order and delivered it in a damaged condition, he made
a, prima facie case of negligence which cast upon such
bailee the burden of showing the circumstances surrounding the damage. And he insists that, even if the presumption did not so arise, there was ample proof of negligence on the part of the owners of respondent.
The facts supported by the evidence, so far as they are
material to these contentions, may be stated briefly as
follows:
October 13, 1925, Roos, an employee of the Consolidated
Shipbuilding Corporation, which had just completed the
Drifter, made an agreement with Alexander Simpson for
its towage from the builder's plant at Morris Heights in
New York City to Port Newark alongside the steamer
Suscalanco on which it was to be shipped. Later, Simpson told Roos that the White City, an excursion boat
owned by Herbert Simpson and one Rhodes, would do the
towing. Roos told Simpson that the boat should be at
the plant at six o'clock in the morning. Her owners
brought her about eight and were the only persons aboard
at any time here involved. Employees of the builder as-

sisted in attaching the Drifter, then in good condition,
to the White City by a forty foot rope. A cradle in which
the former was to be stowed on the deck of the Suscalanco
was attached by another rope about the same length to
the stern of the Drifter. The builder put an employee,
one Weston, on the Drifter, merely, as petitioner maintains, to tend lines when she was brought alongside the
Suscalanco.
Respondent took the tow down the East River; the
cradle became detached at Hell Gate; reattaching it
caused delay of fifteen or twenty minutes, but no damage
occurred to the Drifter at that time. Respondent continued down the river, across the Upper Bay, through
Kill van Kull and into Newark Bay, where, about five
o'clock in the afternoon, she sighted the Suscalanco going
out to sea. Then the tug went to Fisher's Dock in Bayonne, and her owners having learned by telephone that
the shipment could be made on a later steamer, remained
there over night. The Drifter was tied alongside the pier
with fenders to prevent injfiry. Weston, with the acquiescence of the owners of the tug, went home for the night
but did not return. Simpson testified that on the
morning following he went aboard the Drifter to steer her
while she and the cradle were being towed to destination;
that before leaving the dock he inspected her and that
she was in the same condition as when received. When
they arrived at Port Newark, about eight in the morning,
the Drifter's hull planking was broken or damaged amidships on the starboard side just above the water line
causing a dish-shaped depression about three-quarters
of an inch deep, roughly circular and about twelve or
fourteen inches in diameter. At the trial it was suggested by way of explanation that the hole might have
been made by a piece of driftwood, of which there was
much in the bay. But there was no evidence to show,
and the trial court found that neither Rhodes nor Simp-

son could explain, when, how or where the damage
happened.
Decisions of this Court show that under a towage contract the tug is not a bailee of the vessel in tow or its
cargo. And it is established here and by numerous rulings of lower federal courts that evidence showing a
tug's receipt of a tow in good order and delivery in damaged condition raises no presuinption of negligence.
The supplying of power by a vessel, usually one propelled by steam, to tow or draw another is towage. Many
vessels, such as barges and canal boats, have no power
of their own and are built with a, view to receiving their
propelling force from other sources. And vessels having
motive power often employ auxiliary power to assist
them in moving about harbors and clocks. Benedict on
Admiralty, 5th ed., ยง 100.
The tug does not have exclusive control over the tow
but only so far as is necessary to enable the tug and those
in charge of her to fulfill the engagement. They do not
have control such as belongs to common c:irriers and other
bailees. They have no authority over the master or hands
of the towed vessel beyond such as is reqo ired to govern
the movement of the flotilla. In all other respects and for
all other purposes the vessel in tow, its cargo and crew,
remaini under the authority of its nster; and, in emergency the dluty is upon hin to (determuile what shall be
done for the safety of his vessel and her cargo. In all
such cases the right of decision l)elongs to the master
of the tow and not to the master of the tug. A contract
merely for towage does not require or contemplate such
a delivery as is ordinarily deemed essential to bailment.

424. The owner of the Drifter did not surrender to respondent any right of control that does not'pass in virtue
of a contract merely for towage. The fact that the man
put aboard by the builder did not remain to the end, or
that the owner did not choose to keep some one on the
tow, is immaterial.
Petitioner's claim against respondent is not for breach
of contract but one in tort. His allegations and proof
in respect of the agreement between the parties were made
by way of inducement to his reel grievance, which was
the damage to the Drifter claimed to have been caused
by negligence of the respondent. It has long been settled
that suit by the owner of a tow against her tug to recover
for an injury to the tow caused by negligence on the part
of the tug is a suit ex delicto and not ex contractu. The

last cited Judge Lowell said (p. 312): "These cases of
tow against tug are, in form and fact, very like collision
cases. The contract gives rise to duties very closely resembling those which one vessel owes to others which it
may meet." In The John G. Stevens, supra, this court
cited The Arturo, approvingly and said (p. 126): "The essential likeness between the ordinary case of a collision
between two ships, and the liability of a tug to her tow
for damages caused to the latter by a collision with a

third vessel, is exemplified by the familiar practice in adwhich allows the owner of a tow, inmiralty ....
jured by a collision caused by the conduct of her tug and
of another vessel, to sue both in one libel, and to recover
against either or both, according to the proof at the hearing." And the rule that the lien for damages occasioned
by negligent towage takes precedence of liens for supplies
previously furnished the offending vessel rests upon the
ground that the claim, like those in case of collision, is
one in tort arising out of duty imposed by law and independently of any contract or consideration for the towage. The John G. Stevens, supra, 126. The Arturo,
supra.
While respondent was not an insurer or liable as a
common carrier, it owed to the owner of the Drifter the
duty to exercise such reasonable care and maritime skill as
prudent navigators employ for the performance of similar service. The burden was upon petitioner to show that
the loss for which he sought recovery was caused by a
breach of that duty. The mere fact that the Drifter was
in good order when received by respondent and in damaged
condition when delivered does not raise any presumption
of fault. As said by this court in The L. P. Dayton, supra,
(p. 351): " To hold otherwise would require that in every
case, as between the tow and its tug, the latter should be
required affirmatively to establish its defence against
the presumption of its negligence. . . . [p. 352.]
Neither is it material that the facts of the case and the
causes of the collision are peculiarly within the knowledge
of the respondents. It is alleged in the present case, as
one of the inconveniences of the libellant's situation, that
it would be compelled, in order to establish the allegations of the libel, to resort to the testimony of those navigating the respective tugs, and thus call witnesses interested to exonerate the vessel to which they were attached.
We are not aware, however, of any ground on which such
an inconvenience can affect the rule of law which governs

STEVENS v. THE WHITE CITY.

Opiion of the Court.

the rights of the parties." See Thc Steamer Webb, supra;
TransportationLine v. Hope, supra. The rule has been
applied in numerous cases in the lower federal courts.'
There is nothing about the injury itself to warrant any
inference that it resulted from fault or negligence on the
part of respondent.
There is no support for petitioner's contention that,
without regard to the asserted presumption, the evidence
shows that the injury to the Drifter was caused by negligence of respondent. The facts to which he refers are
these: The tug arrived at the plant two hours late; respondent remained over night at Bayonne without authority and left the Drifter without a watchman; on the
following morning, without effort to obtain the services
of Weston or another, the tug proceeded to Port Newark.
He calls attention to the absence of evidence further to
show how the Drifter was moored at Bayonne and
whether she was lighted during the night. On that basis
he argues that it is possible that the injury occurred
during the night; that the Drifter "might have been
rammed by some other boat or if the lines were not slackened and the tide receded she might have been hanging
on the side of the dock as the result whereof, a pile might
have stove a hole in her side." The burden of proof
as to respondent's negligence remained upon petitioner
throughout the trial. His contentions clearly show that
the evidence leaves the time, place and cause of the injury
