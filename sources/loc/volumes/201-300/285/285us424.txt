in United States waters unintentionally. If the libellants
are entitled to have applied the law of the United States
in respect to the liability, the Canadian courts will, it must
be assumed, give effect to it. The District Court embodied in the decrees an order that the respondent should
appear and file security in any action which might be
institute(] by the petitioners in the admiralty courts of
Canada, so that petitioners would not by dismissal of
the libels lose the security gained by the foreign attachment. It is difficult to conceive of a,state of facts more
clearly justifying the refusal of a District Court to retain jurisdiction in a cause between foreigners.

JUSTICE

BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Section 211 of the Criminal Code declares unmailable,
"every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy, book,
pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, print, or other publication of an indecent character "; and provides that " whoever shall knowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited for
mailing and delivery" any such unmailable matter "shall
be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
Under this statute Limehouse was indicted in the federal court for eastern South Carolina. The indictment
contained thirty counts, each charging the unlawful deposit of "a certain filthy letter and writing in a certain
post office." Each set forth verbatim a separate letter.
The letters contained much foul language; charged the
addressees or persons associated with them with sexual
immorality, and in some cases charged miscegenation and
similar practices. They were coarse, vulgar, disgusting,
indecent; and unquestionably filthy within the popular
meaning if that term. On the ground that no letter was
obscene, lewd or lascivious within the meaning given to
those terms in Swearingen v. Unitcd States, 161 U. S.
446, fhe District Court sustained a demurrer and quashed
the indictment. The case is here by direct appeal under
the C 'ninal Appeals Act as amended.' We are of opinion
that the judgment should be reversed.
See Acts of M-arch 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246; February 13,

OCTOBER. TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285U.S.

In Swearingen v. United States, decided in 1896, the
indictment was under Revised Statutes § 3893, which
made unmailable only "obscene, lewd, or lascivious"
matter. This Court , being of opinion that those words
should be given the meaning attributed .to them at common law in prosecutions for criminal libel, directed that
the judgment of conviction be reversed, because the language used was not "calculated to corrupt and debauch
the mind and morals of those into whose hands it might
161 U. S. at 451.
fall" and induce sexual imr'orality. -The indictment here under review contains no reference
to" obscene, lewd, or lascivious." The charge is of depositing "a certain filthy letter." It is brought under the
amendment to § 3893 of the Revised Statutes made by
§ 211 of the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321,
35 Stat. 1088, 1129, which inserted the words, "and every
filthy." Now the clause reads "every obscene, lewd, or
lascivious, and every filthy, book, . . . letter."
The lower court failed to recognize that the amendment
introduced, not merely a word, but a phrase. Disregarding the collocation of the words, it treated the amended
clause as if it had read "obscene, lewd, lascivious, or
filthy; " and then, applying the doctrine of noscitur a
sociis, gave to " fifthy" the meaning attributed in the.
Swearingen case to the words "obscene, -lewd, or lascivious." Thus, the court emptied the amendment of all
meaning. We think that it is a more natural reading of
the clause to hold that by the amendment Congress added
a new class of unmailable matter,-the filthy.2 The let'For the legislative history of the amendment'see Senate Doc. No.

v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 590.

Argued March 14, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. Defendants were convicted in the District of Columbia upon an
indictment under § 215 of the Criminal Code, charging that, having devised there a scheme to defraud a named corporation in
manner and form set forth, they did, for the purpose of executing the scheme, place in a designated post office in Pennsylvania,
to be sent and delivered by the post office establishment to the addressee thereof, certain accounts enclosed in an envelope addressed
to the company at a stated address in the District of Columbia.
The indictment did not allege specifically that they caused the
letter to be delivered by mail according to the,directiofi thereon.
Held that against objection first made by motion in arrest, and
upon a record not containing the evidence or instructions, the
indictment should be sustained as charging an offense committed
within that District, because of the presumption that the letter was
delivered there. Pp. 429-431.
2. Proof that a letter properly directed was placed in a post office,
creates a presumption that it reached its destination in usual time
and was actually received by the person to whom it was addressed.
And the fact that receipt of the letter subjects the person sending
it to a penalty does not alter the rule. P. 430.
