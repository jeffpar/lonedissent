prescribed, is the only one under which punishment could
be imposed for illegal importation.' The language used
is sufficiently broad to include specific penalties fixed in
other sections of the statute and also such as might be
imposed by separate legislation. The tariff act, a later
statute, fixes a definite penalty for one of the violations
grouped in the penal section of the earlier act. In this
respect it superseded the general provisions of the prior
statute embracing the same subject. Cook County National Bank v. United States, 107 U. S. 445; Walla Walla
v. Walla Walla Water Co., 172 U. S. 1, 22. The indictment charged an offense under the Tariff Act and the
judgment must be affirmed.'

UNITED STATES v. SCHARTON.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 621.

Argued March 22, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

Section 1110 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 sets a general limitation of three years upon the prosecution of " any of the various
offenses arising under the internal revenue laws . . . Provided,
That for offenses involving the defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States . . . in any manner, the period of limitation shall be six years. .. ." Held:
1. That the six year limitation is confined to cases in which fraud
is made an ingredient by the statute defining the offense; and
that it does not apply to the offense of wilfully attempting to evade
- U. S. C., Tit. 27, § 46. "Any person . . . who . . . violates any
of the provisions of this chapter, for which offense a special penalty
is not prescribed, shall be fined for a first offense not more than
$500...."

was by falsely understating taxable income. P. 520.

APPEAL from a judgment sustaining a plea of the statute
of limitations, and quashing the indictment.

Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher, and Messrs. Whitney North
Seymour, Sewall Key, and John H. McEvers were on the
brief, for the United States.
An attempt to defeat or evade a tax not only is an
attempt to deprive the Government of property or money
to which it is entitled, Capone v. United States, 51 F. (2d)
609, 615, but also obstructs the collection of the revenue
which "is essential to the very existence of Government."
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 428. To obstruct
the functions of any department of the Government is to
defraud the Government. Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462,
and like cases. "Evasion " implies avoidance by device or
strategy or concealment where good faith requires disclosure (see Murray v. American Yeomen, 180 Iowa 626,
648; State v. Bernstein, 129 Iowa 520, 522); and "intent
to defeat" is equivalent to "intent to defraud." Laing v.
Slingerland, 12 Ont. Pr. 366.
The courts have continuously treated any attempt to
evade or defeat a tax as an offense involving fraud. Levy
v. United States, 271 Fed. 942; Emmich v. United States,
298 Fed. 5; Guzik v. United States, 54 F. (2d) 618, cert.
den., post, p. 545; Capone v. United States, 51 F. (2d)
609; United States v. LaFontaine, 54 F. (2d) 371.
Where an attempt to defraud the United States is an
ingredient of the offense, such offense falls under the

proviso of § 1110 (a), fixing a six-year period of limitation. United States v. Noveck, 271 U. S. 201, 204.
Mr. E. Mark Sullivan for appellee.
MR. ,JUSTtCE RBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The appellee was indicted under § 1114 (b) of the
Revenue Act. of 19261 the charge being attempts to evade
taxes for 1926 and 1927 by falsely understating taxable
income. In bar of the action he pleaded that the face of
the indictment showed the offenses were committed more
than three years prior to the return of a true bill. The
plea was sustained and the indictment quashed, on the
ground that the period of limitations is fixed by the first
clause of § 1110 (a) of the Act,' and not, as the appellant
contended, in the proviso thereof. The basis of this
.ruling was that the offense defined by use of the words
"evade or defeat" does not involve defrauding or attempting to defraud within the intent of the proviso.
The appellant contends fraud is implicit i- the concept
of evading or defeating; and asserts that attempts to
obstruct or defeat the lawful functions of any department
of the Government (Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462,
479-480) or to cheat it out of money to which it is entitled
'U. S. Code, Supp. V) Title 26, § 1266.

"Any . . . person who

willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax irnposed by this title or the payment thereof shall . .. be guilty of a
'felony .
.
2 U.-S. Cbde, Supp. V, Title IS, § 585.
"No person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any of the various offenses arising under
the internal revenue laws of the United States unless the indictment
is fo und or the information instituted within three years next after
the commission of the offense: Provided, That for offenses involving
the defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States or any
agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, the
period of limitation shall be six years .

UNITED STATES v. SCHARTON.

Opinion of the Court.

(Capone v. United Sta~tes, 51 F. (2d) 609, 615) are attempts
to defraud the United States if accompanied by deceit,
craft, trickery or other dishonest methods or schemes,
Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U. S. 182, 188.
Any effort to defeat or evade a tax is said to be tantamount to and to possess every element of an attempt to
defraud the taxing body.
We are required to ascertain the intent of Congress
from the language used and to determine what cases the
proviso intended to except from the general statute of
limitations applicable to all offenses against the internal
revenue laws. Section 1114 (a) makes wilful failure to
pay taxes, to make return, to keep necessary records, or
to supply requisite information, a misdemeanor; and
§ 1114 (c) provides that wilfully aiding, assisting, procuring, counselling, or advising preparation or presentation of a false or fraudulent return, affidavit, claim, or
document shall be a felony. Save for that under consideration these are the only sections in the Revenue Act of
1926 defining offenses against the income tax law. There
are, however, numerous statutes expressly making intent
to defraud an element of a specified offense against the
revenue laws. Under these, an indictment failing to
aver that intent would be defective; but under § 1114 (b)
such an averment would be surplusage, for it would be
sufficient to plead and prove a wilful attempt to evade or
defeat. Compare United States v. Noveck, 271 U. S.
201, 203.
As said in the Noveck case, statutes will not be read as
creating crimes or classes of crimes unless clearly so intended, and obviously we are here concerned with one
meant only to fix periods of limitation. Moreover, the
concluding clause of the section, though denominated a
proviso, is an excepting clause and therefore to be nar'See U. S. Code, Tit. 26, §§ 261, 306, 316, 555, 667, 775, 843, 1180,

rowly construed. United States v. McElvain, 272 U. S.
633, 639. And as the section has to do with statutory
crimes it is to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose,
and ought not to be extended by construction to embrace
so-called frauds not so denominated by the statutes creating offenses. United States v. Hirsch, '100 U. S. 33;
United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78, 87-88; United
States v. Noveck, supra; United States v. McElvain,
supra. The purpose of the proviso is to apply the six year
period to cases "in which defrauding or an attempt to
defraud the United States is an ingredient under the statute defining the offense." United States v. Noveck, supra.
Judgment affirmed.
