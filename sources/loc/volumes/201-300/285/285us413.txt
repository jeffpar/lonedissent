COURT OF APPEALS

SECOND

CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

Argued February 25, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. In a suit in admiralty between foreigners it is ordinarily within
the discretion of the District Court to refuse to retain jurisdiction;
and the exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed unless abused.
P. 418.
2. This rule applies even though the cause of action arose in this
country. Pp. 418, 419.
3. Two ships of Canadian registry and ownership, each carrying
cargo shipped from one Canadian port to another, collided on Lake
Superior while unintentionally in United States waters, and one
ship sank. While suit was pending in a Canadian court of admiralty to determine liability as between the ships, libels in personam
against the owner of one of them were filed by cargo owners in a
federal district court in New York. All the parties were citizens
of Canada, and the officers and crew of each vessel-the material
witnesses-were citizens and residents of that country. Opposing
affidavits alleged that the motive of the cargo owners in coining to
a court of the United States lay in the opportunity in our law to
recover full damages from the non-carrying vessel, whereas, in
Canada, the liability would be divided equally between the two
vessels if both were at fault. The district court dismissed the libels,
but ordered that the respondent should appear and file security in
any action which might be instituted by the libelants in the admiTogether with No. 488, British Empire Grain Co., Ltd. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd., and No. 489, Starnes v. Same.

Mr. D. Roger Englar, with whom Messrs. Oscar R.
Huston, Leonard J. Matteson, Henry J. Bigham, and
James W. Ryan were on the brief, for petitioners.
The Treaty of January 11, 1909, clearly provides that
both of the parties shall have the right to navigate freely
throughout the waters of the Great Lakes, on either side
of the international boundary line; and provides with
equal clearness that vessels of one nation entering the
territorial waters of another, are subject to the local laws,
which, in this case, undoubtedly include the rule that all
vessels must navigate with caution and at moderate speed
in fog.. The only limitation on the sovereignty of the
United States, so far as concerns Canadian vessels, is that
it shall not pass any law inconsistent with the free navigation of the waters in question by such vessels; and that
it shall not pass any law which does not apply equally to
the ships and citizens of both countries. There is not the
slightest support in the treaty for the suggestion that the
maritime law of the United States is not effective on the
Great Lakes up to the international boundary line. These
waters remain a part of the United States and subject to
its laws, just as much as New York harbor or the Mississippi River.
It follows that any liability for a tort committed in
these waters is determined, both as to its existence and
its extent, by the maritime law of the United States.

The remarks of this Court in The Maggie Hammond,

not obligatory, clearly related to a case, like the one before it, where the cause of action arose outside the territorial limits of the United States.

should be discretionary with respect to a collision occur-

ring within the territorial limits of this country. The act
is wrongful and gives rise to a cause of action only because
of the laws of this country. The cause of action arises
out of the law of this country and as a result of a breach
of its laws. Our courts have criminal as well as civil
jurisdiction of offenses at the point at which the collision
occurred. The violations of law which contributed to this
collision are a breach of our peace and of the security
which our laws guarantee to the strangers within our
gates, as well as to our own citizens. Brown on Juris.,

In matters relating to the internal discipline of the ship,
American law, both civil and criminal, is sometimes applied to acts done on board American vessels in foreign
waters. United States v. Rodgers, 150 U. S.249; Thompson Towing & Wrecking Assn. v. McGregor, 20Y7 Fed. 209;

We think it is clear that the discretion mentioned in
the cases last cited is to be exercised by Congress or by
the treaty-making power, and not by the courts. The
situation is quite different where our courts are asked to
enforce the laws of a foreign country. They do so only as
a matter of comity; and they may, in their discretion
decline to do so' The presumption is that in any suit
by these petitioners against the respondent in the Canadian courts, those courts would apply the substantive law

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These three libels in admiralty in personam were
brought in the federal court for western New York, by
owners of cargo laden on the steamer "Yorkton" to recover for loss resulting from the sinking of that vessel in
a collision with respondent's steamer" Mantadoc," in Lake
Superior, on the American side of the international boundary line. The respondent moved, in each case, that the
District Court exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction and dismiss the libels on the ground that all the
parties were citizens of Canada and that the controversy
concerned "matters . . . properly the subjects of hearing

and determination " by the Canadian courts. The motions were granted, 49 F. (2d) 802, 804; and the decrees
of the District Court were affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 51 F. (2d) 1007. This
Court granted certiorari.
Shortly after the collision, the Wreck Commissioner of
Canada held a formal investigation, as required by law,
respecting the circumstances of the collision, and determined that the masters of both vessels were at fault. The
respondent then instituted in the admiralty court of Canada a pr6ceeding for the judicial determination of the
liability as between the colliding vessels and their owners.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285U.S.

The libellants' motive for invoking the jurisdiction of a
court of the United States, instead of that of the Canadian
court in which that proceeding was pending, appears in
affidavits filed with the exceptions to the libel. Under
the Canadian law, it is stated, if both colliding vessels
were at fault each vessel would be liable for not more
than half of the loss; and the salvaged value of the Yorkton might not suffice to pay its share. See The Milan,
Lush. Adm. 401. Under our law the innocent cargoowner can recover full damages from the non-carrying
vessel. The New York, 175 U. S. 187, 209, 210.
The libellants concede, as they must, that in a suit in
admiralty between foreigners it is ordinarily within the
discretion of the District Court to refuse to retain jurisdiction; and that the exercise of its discretion will not be
disturbed unless abused. Charter Shipping Co. v. Bowring, Jones & Tidy, Ltd., 281 U. S. 515, 517. Compare
Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione,
248 UT. S. 9; Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531, 544. They
claim, however, that the rule is not applicable here since
the cause of action arose within the territorial limits
of the United States; and, moreover, that if the District
Court had discretion, the decrees should be reversed bepause, on the undisputed facts, it was an abuse of discretion to decline jirisdiction. We are of opinion that
neither claim is well founded.
First. The contention that the jurisdiction was obligatory rests upon the fact that the collision occurred within
the territorial waters of the United States. The argument is that a cause of action arising from a collision
occurring on territorial waters of the United States arises
out of its laws, since within its territory there can be no
other law, Smith v. Condry, 1 How. 28, 33; Slater v.
Mexican National R. Cb., 194 U. S. 120, 126; New York
Central R. Co. v. Chisholm, 268 U. S. 29, 32; that the
Constitutioin, Art. III, § 2, cl. 1, extends the judicial

CANADA MALTING CO. v. PATERSON CO. 419

Opinion of the Court.

power to "all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;" that § 24 of the Judicial Code confers upon the
District Court jurisdiction "of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;" and that by vesting
jurisdiction in that Court, Congress imposed a duty upon
it to exercise the jurisdiction, Cohcns v. Virginia,6 Wheat.
264, 404; McClellan v. Carland,217 U. S. 268, 281; Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 58, 59. In
support of the argument that there is no power to decline jurisdiction in cases where the cause of action arose
within the United States, the libellants urge the statement
in The Belgenland, 114 U. S. 355, 365, that "the courts
will use a discretion about assuming jurisdiction of controversies between foreigners in cases arising beyond the
territorial jurisdiction of the country to which the courts
belong.'
The respondent insists that the doctrine of lex loci
delicti has no application to cases of collision on the Great
Lakes; that the Great Lakes and their connecting channels constitute public navigable waters, irrespective of the
location of the international boundary, and possess all the.
characteristics of the high seas, The Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, 22;
United States v. Rodgers, 150 U. S. 249, 256; Panama R.
Co. v. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U. S. 280, 285; The New
York, 175 U. S. 187; The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17,
27; that in a case of collision on the high seas between two
vessels of the same nationality, liability is governed by
the lw of the flag, The Scotland, 105 U. S. 24, 29, 30;
The Eagle. Point, 142 Fed. 452, 454; that the Canadian
law would apply in the cases at bar; and that hence, the
asserted ground for the District Court's retaining jurisdiction fails.
We have no occasion to enquire by what law the rights
of the parties are governed, as we are of the opinion that,
under any view of that question, it lay within the discretion of the District Court to decline to assume jurisdiction

over the controversy. The suggestion drawn from the
language in The Belgenland, supra, that such discretion
exists only "in cases arising beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the country to which the courts belong," is
without support in either the earlier or the later decisions
of this Court. Nor is it justified by the language relied
on, when that language is read in its context. The case of
The Belgenland arose out of a collision on the high seas
betvPeen foreign vessels of different nationalities; and the
objection was raised that the courts of the United States
were wholly without jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Bradley,
speaking for the Court, replied that jurisdiction in admiralty did exist over controversies between foreigners
arising without the territorial waters of this country, but
that the court in such a case would use its discretion in
determining whether to exercise it. That the Court had
no intention of denying the existence of similar discretion,
where the cause of action arose within the territorial waters of this country, is shown by its reference to the cases
of The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 457, and Taylor
v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 611, in which no such limitation
was expressed, and which the Court described as "accurately stating" the law. The doctrine of these earlier
cases was recently reiterated by this Court, in similar
terms, in Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531, 544, where it
was said: "Admiralty courts . . . have complete jurisdiction over suits of a maritime nature between foreigners. Nevertheless, 'the question is one of discretion in
every case, and the court will not take cognizance of the
case if justice would be as well done by remitting the
parties to their home forum.'" See also Charter Ship-*

Opinion of the Court.

The rule recognizing-an unqualified discretion to decline
jurisdiction in suits in admiralty between foreigners appears to be supported by an unbroken line of decisions in
the lower federal courts.2 The question has most frequently been presented in suits by foreign seamen against
masters or owners of foreign vessels, relating to claims
for wages and like differences,' or to claims of personal
injury.4 Although such cases are ordinarily decided acSee note 5, infra. See also One Hundred and Ninety-four Shawls,

cording to the foreign law, they often concern causes of
action arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States, compare Patterson v. The Eudora, 190
U. S. 169; The Kestor, 110 Fed. 432, 450. Neither in
these, nor in other cases, has the bare circumstance of
where the cause of action arose been treated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise discretion
whether to take jurisdiction.'
Obviously, the proposition that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it, is not universally true; else the
admiralty court could never decline jurisdiction on the
ground that the litigation is beween foreigners. Nor is
it true of courts administering other systems of our law.

The only case supporting the position of the petitioners which has
been called to our attention is The Apurimac, 7 F. (2d) 741, 742, involving an action by a foreign seaman for injuries sustained on a foreign vessel lying in American waters. The expressions of the District
Court in this case, however, were disapproved by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmcd the judgment on the
ground that jurisdiction, although discretionary, had been properly
taken. Heredia v. Davies, 12 F. (2d) 500, 501.
In The Steamship Russia, 3 Ben. 471, 476-479, Fed. Cas. No. 12,168,
the district court for the southern district of New York, took jurisdiction of a libel arising out of the collision of foreign vessels of different nationalities in New York harbor, but expressly treated the
question as one within its discretion. In The Bifrost, 8 F. (2d) 361,
362, jurisdiction was declined in an action by foreign seamen for
breach of contract in shipping articles, although it was urged that the
articles were signed in this country and governed by its law. See also

Opinion of the Court.

Courts of equity and of law also ocassionally decline, in
the interest of justice, to exercise jurisdiction, where the
suit is between aliens or non-residents or where for kindred reasons the litigation can more appropriately be conducted in a foreign tribunal. The decisions relied upon
by libellants are inapposite for several reasons. They
were not in admiralty causes; nor did they involve alien
or non-resident parties. Compare Second Employers'
Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 58, 59, with Douglas v. New
York, New Haven. & Hartford R. Co., 279 U. S. 377.
The cases of Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404, and
McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 281, denied the
right to abdicate to state courts jurisdiction which the
Constitution in positive terms entrusts to the federal
judiciary.
Second. There is no basis for the contention that the
District Court abused its discretion. All the parties were
not only foreigners, but were citizens of Canada. Both
the colliding vessels were registered under the laws of
Canada; and each was owned by a Canadian corporation.
The officers and the crew of each vessel-the material
witnesses-were citizens and residents of that country;
and so would not be available for compulsory attendance
in the District Court. The cargo, in each case, was
shipped under a Canadian bill of lading from one Canadian port to another. The collision occurred at a point
where the inland waters narrowed to a neck and the District Court concluded that the colliding vessels proceeded

in United States waters unintentionally. If the libellants
are entitled to have applied the law of the United States
in respect to the liability, the Canadian courts will, it must
be assumed, give effect to it. The District Court embodied in the decrees an order that the respondent should
appear and file security in any action which might be
institute(] by the petitioners in the admiralty courts of
Canada, so that petitioners would not by dismissal of
the libels lose the security gained by the foreign attachment. It is difficult to conceive of a,state of facts more
clearly justifying the refusal of a District Court to retain jurisdiction in a cause between foreigners.
