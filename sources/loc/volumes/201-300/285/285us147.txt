EASTERN AIR TRANSPORT v. TAX COMM. 147

Syllabus.

opposite direction (like the one in question) after the
rail had worked out of alignment, would be derailed. But
the argument with respect to the time when the displacement might have been effected, which in any event could
not have been very long before the accident, and the contention based on the position of the nuts and bolts, are
unavailing in view of the lack of evidence tending to show
that the defendant was in any way responsible for the
condition which caused the derailment.
There are many details which it is unnecessary to review as they do not affect the essential question. It is
sufficient to say that upon a careful examination of the
entire .record we are unable to discover any basis for a
finding of negligence on the part of defendant. The motion for the direction of a verdict in its favor should have
been granted. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Davis; 279
U. S. 34; Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U. S. 90; Atchison,
Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Saxon, 284 U. S. 458.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
EASTERN AIR TRANSPORT, INC. v. SOUTH CARO-

LINA TAX COMMISSION

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 504. Argued February 25, 1932.-Decided March 14, 1932.
A state tax of six cents per gallon on sales of gasoline was added by
the seller to gasoline bought by an air-transport company for use
in its planes, which traversed the State in interstate commerce and
stopped at several places there, but transported no passengers or
freight between those places. Held:
Whether viewed as a tax on property or as an excise, ihe tax is
not a direct burden on interstate commerce and is within the power
of the State. P. 152.
52 F. (2d) 456, affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Argument for Appellant.

285U.S.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court of three
judges denying an interlocutory injunction in a suit to
restrain collection of a state tax.

Mr. William Henry White, Jr., with.whom Mr. Christie
Benet was on the brief, for appellant.
Appellant is engaged in the transportation of passengers exclusively by airplanes between Newark, N. J., and
Miami, Florida, and, in addition, United States mail between Newark, N. J., and other points, under contract
with the Post Office Department, with stops at intermediate points.
Because of the state of the art of flying, and present
type of airplane construction, it is impossible for an airplane to make the flight from Newark' to M.iami, or even
a much shorter flight, without refueling at intermediate
points. The necessities of appellant's transportation instrumentalities require it, therefore, to fuel in the State
of South Carolina, for without so doing, it could not
complete its flight or carry the United States mail as
required by its contract with the Post Office Department.
The tax is imposed upon the seller, but in fact is passed
along to the purchaser, and all of it is remitted by the
seller to the State and used solely for state and county
highways. Appellant has paid this tax on all gasoline
purchased in the State, and has never been able to pu'chase gasoline in South Carolina except upon its payment.
The amount paid is $5,000.00 or more a year.
The highest court of South Carolina declares the tax
to be an "excise " tax. And since it is the public policy
of the State to rest the burden upon the ultimate consumer, thepractical effect of enforcement is the same as
if the law in so many words laid the tax on the ultimate
consumer. PanhandleOil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S.218.
It needs little imagination to perceive that such a
burden in one State, if repeated in other States through

EASTERN AIR TRANSPORT v. TAX COMM. 149

Argument for Appellant.

which appellant must operate its airplanes under its contract to carry the mails of the United St'ates, would soon
become so heavy as to be prohibitive. The burden of the
tax, though imposed upon the seller by law, falls upon
the consumer, and such burden is a direct burden. Texas
Co. v. Brown, 258 U. S. 466; Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S. 218; Indian Motocycle Co. v. United
States, 283 U. S. 570.
A tax intended to fall, and which does fall, upon the
ultimate consumer, has precisely the same effect as if
laid upon use rather than sale. There can be no use
without a previous sale, or purchase. The one leads to
the other.
In seeking to treat "sale " as separate and distinct
from subsequent use, the court below overlooks the principle decided in such cases as Lemke v. Farmers Grain
Co., 258 U. S. 50; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. V. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282; and Shafer v. Farmers Grain Co.,
268 U. S. 189, where the act of buying, though performed
wholly within a State, was treated as a part of the interstate transaction of shipment. In those cases there' was
a regular and established business of buying grain in one
State for shipment to another State, and the grain so
bought was shipped in interstate commerce. The analogy
to the present case is complete. Here the appellant buys
a special type of gasoline intended for use in airplanes; it
intends to use that gasoline, and does in fact use it, only
in airplanes engaged . exclusively in interstate commerce.
The purchase is a mere incident in the course of regular and consistent interstate business. Board v. Olsen,
262 U. S. 1, 35.
The exigencies of a trade determine what is essential
to the business or process of interstate commerce in that
trade. Thames & Mersey Ins. Co. v. United States, 237
U. S. 19.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285U.S.

The purchase of gasoline in South Carolina is just as
indispensable to the uninterrupted conduct of appellant's
interstate business as the sales at the Chicago stockyards-which per se were local transactions but were held
by the Court in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U. S. 495, to be
so intimately associated with interstate commerce as to
be a part thereof-were essential to the continuity of the
flow of cattle from the ranges in the west to the markets
in the east. The State of South Carolina, therefore, had
no power to tax these sales, just as in Norfolk & W. R. Co.
v. Pennsylvania, 136 U. S. 114, 120, the State of Pennsylvania could not impose a license tax upon a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce for the privilege of
maintaining an office in the State.
That an event subsequent to a sale may convert the
sale into an interstate transaction is decided by Federal
Trade Comm. v. Trade Assn., 273 U. S. 52.
Cf. Helson v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245; Station WBT,
Inc. v. Poulnot, 46 F. (2d) 671; U. S. Airways, Inc. v.

Co., 45 F. (2d) 400; N. J. Bell Tel. Co. v. State Board,

Messrs. John M. Daniel, Attorney General of South
Carolina, and J. Fraser Lyon were on the brief for appellees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This suit was brought to restrain the collection of a
tax, imposed by the State of South Carolina, of six cents
a gallon with respect to gasoline purchased by complainant in that State and used by complainant in interstate
commerce. The complainant charged that the state Act

EASTERN AIR TRANSPORT v. TAX COMM. 151
147

Opinion of the Court.

placed a direct burden upon interstate commerce and
hence was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Art. I, § 8. The District Court, composed of three judges as required by statute, denied an
interlocutory injunction, 52 F. (2d) 456, and the complainant appeals to this Court. Jud. Code, § 266; U. S.
C., Tit. 28, § 380.
From the findings of the District Court it appears that
ihe complainant is a Delaware corporation operating, in
interstate commerce, air transport lines across the State
of South Carolina; that its planes make regular stops at
various points in the State but do not carry freight or
passengers between such points, and practically its entire business is interstate in character; that it purchases
gasoline in South Carolina for the use of its planes and
that the seller adds to the price the amount of the state
gasoline tax which the seller is required to pay under
the Act in question, and thus complainant has to pay
six cents a gallon more than it otherwise would, the excess amounting to about $5,000 a year.
The tax is described in the statute' as a license tax,
which, as applied in the instant case against the dealer,
Act of February 23, 1922, as amended (South Carolina Acts, 1922,
pp. 835-838; 1929, pp. 107-112). Section 1 provides: "That every
oil company, person, firm or corporation doing domestic or intra-state
business within this State, and engaging in the business of selling, consigning, using, shipping, or distributing for the purpose of sale within
this State, any gasoline or any substitute therefor, or combination
thereof, for the privilege of carrying on such business shall be subject
to the payment of a license tax, which tax shall be measured by and
graduated in accordance with the volume of sales of such oil company
within the State. Every such oil company shall pay to the State
an amount of money equal to six (6) cents per gallon on all gasoline, combinations thereof, or substitute therefor, sold or consigned,
used, shipped or distributed for the purpose of sale within the
State ..

is for the privilege of carrying on the business of selling
gasoline within the State. The tax is thus imposed upon
the seller and the sales in question are intrastate sales.
The appellant emphasizes the fact that the tax has been
construed by the Supreme Court of the State to be an
excise tax and not a property tax. Gregg Dyeing Co. v.
Query, 166 S. C. 117; 164 S. E. 588, decided April 13,
1931. So far as the present question is concerned, the
distinction is not important. If such a license tax for the
privilege of making sales within the State were regarded
as in effect a tax upon the goods sold,2 its validity could not be questioned in the circumstances here disclosed, as in that aspect the tax would be upon a part
of the general mass of property within the State and
hence subject to the State's authority to tax, although the
property might actually be used in interstate commerce.!
"It is elementary," said the Court in New Jersey Telephone Co. v. Tax Board, 280 U. S.338, 346, " that a State
may tax property used to carry on interstate commerce."
Treating the tax as an excise tax upon the sales does
not change the result in the instant case, as the sales
are still purely intrastate transactions. Superior Oil Co.
v. Mississippi, 280 U. S. 390, 395. Undoubtedly, purchases of goods within a State may form part of trans'Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444; Welton v. Missouri, 91

Opinion of the Court.

actions in interstate commerce and hence be entitled to
enjoy a corresponding immunity. But the mere purchase of supplies or equipment for use in conducting a
business which constitutes interstate commerce is not so
identified with that commerce as to make the sale immune
from a non-discriminatory tax imposed by the State upon
intrastate dealers. There is no substantial distinction between the sale of gasoline that is used in an airplane
in interstate transportation and the sale of coal for the
locomotives of an interstate carrier, or of the locomotives
and cars themselves bought as'equipment for interstate
transportation. A non-discriminatory tax upon local sales
in such cases has never been regarded as imposing a direct
burden upon interstate commerce and has no greater or
different effect upon that commerce than a general property tax to which all those enjoying the protection of the
State may be subjected.
In Helson v. Kentucky, 279 U. S.245, upon which the
appellant relies, the tax was laid by Kentucky with respect to gasoline purchased by the plaintiffs in error in
Illinois and used within Kentucky in the operation of
a ferry boat on the Ohio River between the two States.
The Court found that the tax was laid directly upon the
use of the gasoline in interstate transportation. The
Court said that "The tax is exacted as the price of the
privilege of using an instrumentality of interstate commerce." Id., p. 252. Such a tax is manifestly different
from a general property tax or a tax upon purely local
sales.
Decree affirmed.
