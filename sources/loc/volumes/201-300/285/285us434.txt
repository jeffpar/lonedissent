COOMBES v. GETZ.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 528.

Argued March 21, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. Where the contract clause of the Federal Constitution is involved,
this Court wilt determine for itself whether there be a contract
the obligation of which is within the protection of that clause, and
whether that obligation has been impaired, and, likewise, will determine for itself the meaning and application of state constitutional or statutory provisions said to create the contract or by
which it is asserted an impairment has been cffect'd. P. 441.
2. One section of the California constitution provided that directors
of corporations should be liable to the creditors for all moneys
embezzled or misappropriated by corporate officers. Another section reserved power to alter or repeal all existing or future laws
concerning corporations. While creditors who contracted with a
corporation, with these provisions in force, were suing to enforce
their rights against a director for money misappropriated by the
corporatioih's officers, the section making the director liable was
repealed. Held:
(1), The right to enforce the liability was part of the creditors'
contracts, perfected and fully vested before the repeal, and was
protected by the contract clause of the Constitution and by the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 442, 448.
(2) When the contracts were made, the Supreme Court of
California had not decided that the repeal of a law creating such
a contractual liability extinguishes the cause of action. P. 445.
(3) The so-called reserved power of a State over corporations
and their shareholders can not be used to destroy the vested rights
of third persons or to impair the obligations of their contracts.

Argument for Petitioner.

Mr.. Joseph L. :Lewinwson, with whom Messrs. W. H.
Douglass, Nat Schmulowitz, and Bronte M. Aikins were
on the brief, for petitioner.
Cases involving stockholders' liability demonstrate that
retroactive effect given to repeal of ,§3 of Art. XIIof the
California constitution impairs the obligations of contracts. Hawthorne v. Calef, 2 Wall. 10; Ochiltree v. Iowa
Co., 21 Wall. 249; Pittsburgh Steel Co. v. Equitable Society, 226 U. S. 455; Harrisonv. Paper Co., 140 Fed. 385;
Blackburn v. Irvine, 205 Fed. 217; Woodbine Savings

Harbine, 2 Mo. App. 134; Barton Nat. Bank v. Atkins,
72 Vt. 33; Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657.
The liability of directors under §, 3 of Art. XII of the
California constitution uniformly has been held to be
contractual and not penal. Dean. v. Shingle, 198 Cal.
652; Major v. Walker, 23 Cal. App. 465; O'Connell v.
Walker, 12 Cal. App. 694; Hercules Oil Co. v. Hocknell,
5 Cal. App. 702; Brown v. Major, 164 Fed. 673; Winchester V. Howard, 136 Cal. 432.
In character this liability is indistinguishable from
stockholders' liability for corporate debts imposed by
statute, creating an obligation contractual in its nature.
Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S. 516, 529.
Reserved power to alter or repeal corporation laws
does not empower the State to destroy or impair the
contract rights of creditors. See Morris v. American
Public Utilities, 122 Atl. 696; Yoakam v. Providence Biltmore Hotel Co., 34 F. (2d) 533; Lord v. Equitable Society,

Apart from corporation law, rights of a contractual or
quasi contractual nature that have arisen out of transactions authorized by statute may not be destroyed or
impaired by subsequent repealing statutes. Pacific Mail
S. S. Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450; Wasser v. Congregation
Agudath Sholom, 262 Mass. 235.
The legislature may restrict or revoke, at its pleasure,
any of the powers of a municipal corporation, but in
doing so it may not impair the obligation of contracts.
Van Hoffman v. Quincy, 4 Wall. 535; Wolff v. New Orleans,
103 U. S. 358.
It may not impose unconstitutional conditions upon
corporations or persons dealing with them. Liggett v.

Co., 257 U. S. 529; San Mateo v. Southern Pacific Ry. Co.,
13 Fed. 722; Frost v. R. R. Commission, 271 U. S. 583.
The position in the majority opinion below that the
reservation of power contained in § 1 of Art. XII of the
state constitution justified retroactive repeal, is untenable, because that section is in pari materia with § 16 of
Art. I of the state constitution prohibiting the impairment of the obligation of contracts. Cf. Omaha Water
Co. v. Omaha, 147 Fed. 1; Western Union v. Hopkins,
160 Cal. 106.
If the reserved power clause is an implied term of corporate contracts, it is also an implied term that the clause
be read prospectively. Smathers v. Bank, 135 N. C. 411;

COOMBES v. GETZ.
434

Argument for Respondent.

Mr. Alfred Sutro, with whom Messrs. Oscar Lawler,
Frank D. Madison, and Eugene M. Prince were on the
brief, for respondent.
The power expressly reserved by the constitution of
California to repeal all laws concerning corporations, was
a part of the implied contractual arrangement relied upon
by petitioner. Covington v. Kentucky, 173 U. S. 231;
Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin Co., 192 U. S. 201, 212213; Market Street Ry. Co. v. Hellman, 109 Cal. 571.
The State has power to withdraw contractual rights or
privileges granted by it, such as the privilege of suit here
claimed by petitioner, and may even destroy an express
contract, provided only the power to do so was clearly
reserved. A repealable contract obviously can not be impaired by exercise of the power of repeal. Missouri Pacific
R. Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 262, 274-275; Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U. S. 322, 346; Citizens Savings
Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 636, 644; Owensboro v.
Cumberland Telephone Co., 230 U. S.58.
The contingency of repeal, with a consequent extinction of petitioner's cause of action, was contemplated and
provided for in the contract relied on by petitioner. Long
before the extension of credit by his assignor, the Supreme
Court of California had decided that pending causes of
action upon a director's liability, unknown at common
law, are, unless expressly saved, extinguished by the repeal of the law creating the liability, regardless of whether
the liability is penal or contractual. Under the settled
rule of this Court these decisions were a part of the contract relied upon by petitioner. Warburton v. White, 176
U. S.484; Moss v. Smith, 171 Cal. 777; Freeman v. Telephone Co., 184 Cal. .508; Willcox v. Edwards, 162 Cal.

The California court had in many other cases invoked
the reserved power in support of changes in the corporation laws which affected contract rights.
The reserved power provisions were adopted by the
States, pursuant to the suggestions in the concurring
opinion of Justice Story in the Dartmouth College Case,
for the specific purpose of preserving the power to control
private rights created by the corporation laws against the
claim that the Contract Clause placed such rights beyond
state control. Looker v. Maynard, 179 U. S. 46, 51-52.
Cases involving rights of the corporation or stockholders: Miller v. State, 15 Wall. 478; Looker v. Maynard,

Cases involving contractual rights of third persons:

v. Maynard, 179 U. S. 46; Schurz v. Cook, 148 U. S.
397, 411.
Such authorities as the foregoing establish the principle
that the State can pass any amendatory or repealing law
which it otherwise could have passed under the reserved
power, nothwithstanding that third persons, under the

COOMBES v. GETZ.
434

Opinion of the Court.

prior law, have entered into contractual relations which
indirectly or incidentally will be affected by the amendatory or repealing law. The State may exercise a right
which it has expressly reserved, regardless of what the
incidental result may be upon the ability of creditors to
collect their claims.
While the reserved power is not without limit, and
"sheer oppression and wrong can not be inflicted" under
the guise of amendment or repeal (Shields v. Ohioj 95
U. S. 319, 324-325), it is not dppression or wrong for the
State to retain, through the reserved power, control of
that which the State granted-in this case the privilege
of suit claimed by petitioner. Sinking Fund Cases, 99
U. S.700, 720-721.
The reserved power necessarily gives something more
than the mere right to change the law for the future, because such right as to the future would exist without any
express reservation, and the court can not assume that
the express reservation was made without any object.
If the extent of the reserved power is in doubt, every
intendment is in favor of the decision of the Supreme
Court of California, because the reserved power must be
construed in favor of the State, and because all presumptions favor the constitutionality of laws.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit brought in a California superior court by
petitioner, on behalf of himself and other creditors, to
recover from respondent, a director in Getz Bros. & Company, a California corporation, the amount of an indebtedness upon an open account for goods sold to the corporation by petitioner's assignor. The basis of the liability
sought to be enforced is found in the following provision
of § 3, Art. XII, of the California Constitution of 1879:
"The directors or trustees of corporations and jointstock associations shall be jointly and severally liable to

440

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of.the Court.

285 U.S.

the creditors and stockholders for all moneys embezzled
or misappropriated by the officers of such corporation or
joint-stock association, during the term of office of such
director or trustee."
The bill alleges misappropriation and embezzlement of
moneys of the corporation by its officers, with appropriate
details to bring the respondent within the terms of the
foregoing provision. The superior court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, for reasons not material here,
and rendered final judgment accordingly. An appeal was
taken to the state supreme court; and, while that appeal
was pending, the provision of the state constitution above
quoted was repealed. Thereupon, respondent moved to
dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the cause of action
had abated by reason of the repeal of the provision of
law upon which it was based. The court sustained the
motion and dismissed the appeal [Coombes v. Franklin]
1 P. (2d) 992; and subsequently denied a petition for
rehearing, 4 P. (2d) 157.
In substance, it was held that the right accorded to
corporate creditors was created by, and dependent alone
upon,. the constitutional provision, said to have the force
of a statute; and that when that was repealed, the right
fell with it, being still inchoate, not reduced to possession
nor perfected by final judgment. It was conceded that
the liability created by the constitution was in its nature
contractual and, as a matter of law, entered into and became a part of every contract between the corporation and
its creditors. But this contractual liability, it was said,
was conditioned by the power reserved over corporate
laws by § 1, Art. XII, of the constitution, as follows:
"All laws now in force in this state concerning corporations, and all laws that may be hereafter passed
pursuant to this section, may be altered from time to
time or repealed."

COOMBES v. GETZ.
434

441

Opinion of the Court.

In virtue of this reservation of power, the state court
held that the repeal of the liability provision was a
known contingency constituting a part of the contract
as much as the provision which imposed the liability.
The decision of the supreme court of a state construing and applying its own constitution and laws generally
is binding upon this court; but that is not so where the
contract clause of the Federal Constitution is involved.
In that case this court will give careful and respectful
consideration and all due weight to the adjudication of
the state court, but will determine independently thereof
whether there be a contract, the obligation of which is
within the protection of the contract clause, and whether
that obligation has been impaired; and, likewise, will determine for itself the meaning and application of state
constitutional or statutory provisions said to create the
contract or by which it is asserted an impairment has
been effected. Scott v. McNeal, 154 U. S. 34, 45; Mobile & Ohio R. Co. v. Tennessee, 153 U. S. 486, 492 et seq.;
Stearns v. Minnesota, 179 U. S. 223, 232-233; Louisiana
Ry. & Nay. Co. v. New Orleans, 235 U. S. 164, 170; Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 684; New Orleans Waterworks v. La. Sugar Rfg. Co., 125 U. S. 18, 38; Bridge
Proprietors v. Hbboken Co., 1 Wall. 116, 144; Jefferson
Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436, 443.
In substance, the contention of respondent here is that
the reserved power provision, read into the contract as
one of its terms, authorizes an extinction by repeal of
the creditor's cause of action, unless previously reduced
to final judgment.
The authority of a state under the so-called reserved
power is wide; but it is not unlimited. The corporate
charter may be repealed or amended, and, within limits
not now necessary to define, the interrelations of state,
corporation and stockholders may be changed; but

neither vested property rights nor the obligation of contracts of third persons may be destroyed or impaired.
Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454., 459; Lake S'hore &
1. S.Ry. Co. v..Smith, .173 U. S. 684, 690. Compare
Greenwood v. Freight Co., 105 U. S. 13, 17, 19; Shields v.
Ohio, 95 U. S. 319, 324. The right of this petitioner
to enforce respondent's liability had become fully perfected and .vested prior to the repeal of the liability provision. His cause of action was not purely statutory.
It did not arise upon the constitutional rule of law, but
upon the contractual liability created in pursuance of the
rule. Although the latter derived its being from the
former, it immediately acquired an independent existence
competent to survive the destruction of the provision
which gave it birth. The repeal put an end to the rule
for the future, but it did not and could not destroy or impair the previously vested right of the creditor (which in
every sense was a property right, Ettor v. Tacoma, 228
U. S. 148, 156; Pritchardv. Norton, 106 U. S. 124, 132)
to enforce his cause of action upon the contract. Ettor

Steamship Co. v. Jolifie, 2 Wall' 450; Ochiltree v. Railroad Co., 21 Wall. 249, 252-253; Harrison v. Remington
Paper Co., 140 Fed. 385, 390 et seq.; Knickerbocker Trust
Co. v. Myers, 133 Fed. 764, 767.
The Ettor case, supra, involved a statute of the State
of Washington which required municipalities to compensate for consequential damages. While that statute
was in force actions were brought to recover for damages
inflicted upon abutting property in consequence of street
grading done by the authority and direction of the City
of Tacoma. While these actions were being heard, the
statute in respect of this liability was repealed; and the
trial court directed a verdict for the city, on the theory
that the right of action was statutory and fell with the

COOMBES v. GETZ.

Opinion of the Court.

statute, there being no saving clause. Judgment was affirmed by the statesupreme court and the case came here
on writ of error. This court. reversed the judgment and
in the course of its opiion (pp. 1557156) said:
",The court below gave a retrospective effect to the
amendatory and repealing act by holding that the effect
of the repeal was to destroy the right to compensation
which had accrued while the act was in force. The obligation of the city was fixed.. The plaintiffs in error had a
claim which the city was as much under obligation to pay
.as for the labor employed to do the grading. It was a
claim assignable and enforceable by a common-law action
for a breach of the statutory obligation.
"The necessary effect of the repealing act, as construed
and applied by the court below, was to deprive the plaintiffs in error of any remedy to enforce the fixed liability
of the city to make compensation. This was to deprive
the plaintiffs in error of a right which had vested before
the repealing act, a right which was in every sense a property right. Nothing remained to be done to complete
the plaintiffs' right to compensation except the ascertainment of the amount of damage to their property. The
right of the plaintiffs in error was fixed by the law in
force when their property was damaged for public purposes, and the right so vested cannot be defeated by subsequent legislation."
In the Hawthorne case, supra, it was held that a state
statute, incorporating a railroad company, which 'provided that the shares of the stockholders should be liable
for the debts of the corporation, in effect pledged, the liability or guarantee of the stockholders to the extent of
their stock to the creditors of the company. "They thereby virtually agree to become security to the creditors for
the payment of the debts of the company, which have
been contracted upon the faith of this liability." Haw-

thorne supplied the corporation with materials to build
its road and obtained judgment against it. Being unable
to satisfy the judgment, he brought suit against Calef, -a
stockholder. The state supreme court rendered judgment
against Hawthorne on the ground that the individual liability provision had been repealed by subsequent legislation, passed two months after the debt was contracted,
and that such repeal had taken away the right to enforce
the stockholders' liability. This court reversed on the
ground that when the debt was contracted with the company the creditor held the stockholders' liability as security for its payment and the repealing act, by abolishing it,
impaired the obligation of that contract.
In the Joliffe case, supra, this court had before it for
determination substantially the same question that is involved here. There a California' statute had created a
Board of Pilot Commissioners, and authorized the board
to, license pilots, prescribe their qualifications, etc. The
statute provided, with an exception, that when a vessel
was spoken by a pilot and his service was declined he
should be entitled to one-half pilotage fees. Joliffe, a
pilot licensed under this statute, spoke a vessel of the
Steamship Company and offered his service to pilot her
out of the port of San Francisco. This was declined, and
the pilot brought suit to recover for one-half the pilotage.
Judgment was rendered against the company. Pending
review in this court, a new statute was passed and the old
act, in terms, repealed. The point was made that the
claim to half pilotage fees having been given by statute,
the right to recover fell with its repeal, -and accordingly
that the writ of error should be dismissed. This court
held the point not well taken and declined to dismiss the
writ. The transaction between the pilot and the ship,
it was held (pp. 457-458), gave rise to a quasi contract.
. "The claim of the plaintiff below for half-pilotage fees,
resting upon a transaction regarded by the law as quasi
contract, there is no just ground for the position that -it
fell with the repeal of the statute under which the trans-

.COOMBES v. GETZ.
434

Opinion of the Court.

action was had. When a right has arisen upon a contract,
or a transaction in the nature of a contract authorized
by statute, and has been so far perfected that nothing remains to be done by the party asserting it, the repeal of
the statute does not affect it, or an action for its enforcement. It has become a vested right which stands independent of the statute; And such is the position of the
claim of the plaintiff below in the present action: the
pilotage services had been tendered by him; his claim to
the compensation prescribed by the statute was then perfect, and the liability of the master or owner of the vessel
had become fixed."
Respondent, however, insists that long prior to the
extension of credit to the corporation by petitioner's assignor, the decisions of the Supreme Court of California
had established that the repeal of a law creating such a
liability as that here involved extinguishes the cause of
action;, and that this amounted to a construction of the
constitutional, provision which entered into the contract
and will be followed and applied by this court. Warburton v. White, 176 U. S.484, 495; Ennis Water Works v.
Ennis, 233.U. S.652, 657. But upon a careful consideration of the California cases referred to, we are of opinion
that they fail to establish the premises upon which the
conclusion is based.
The decisions chiefly relied upon are Moss v. Smith, 171
Cal.. 777; 155 Pac. 90, and Willcox v. Edwards, 162 Cal.
455; 123 Pac. 276. Moss v.Smith involved § 309 of the
Civil Code of California, which created a liability against
directors who had participated in the creation of debts
in excess of the subscribed capital stock. Suit was
brought to enforce this liability against directors of a public utility company, but it appearing that during the
pendency of the suit § 309 had been repealed as to public
utility companies without a saving clause, the court held
that all pending causes of action were thereby extinguished. The basis of the decision was that the statute
was of a penal character; the court, however, saying that

446

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285 U.S.

it was not of vital consequence whether it be viewed as
penal or remedial. In any event, the liability was not
held to be contractual. On the contrary, the court said
(p. 787), "The right of action against these directors conferred by section 309 was a statutory right pure and simple, having no foundation in contract, nor any existence
at common law." And -it is significant that the court
perceived a determinative distinction between § 309 of the
Civil Code, and the provision of the constitution here under consideration. " Nothing in Winchester v. Howard,
136 Cal. 441," the court said (p. 785), "is in conflict with
this; in the first place, because the directors, under section 3, article XII, of the constitution, which section was
the foundation of the action, are liable solely for loss sustained by embezzlement and misappropriation-a liability
involving loss and thus entirely different in character from
that which appellants contend is imposed by section 309."
"And that this statute," the court already had said (p.
783), "becomes highly penal in character the moment
there is eliminated from it the consideration of compensation for loss, is at once apparent."
As already suggested, Winchester v. Howard, 136 Cal.
432; 64 Pac. 692; 69 Pac. 77, arose under § 3, Art. XII,
of the state constitution, and the court there, in pointing
out the purpose and effect of that provision, said (p. 444):
"The constitution merely makes the directors sureties
for their fellow-directors and for the officers of the corporation for moneys, when so misappropriated as to make
the officer misappropriating liable, and authorizing the
creditors and stockholders to sue. . . . It is not penal in
the technical sense, as it allows no recovery as a punishment, but only to compensate for a loss."
And again at p. 448:
"There is no difference between this case and the ordinary contract of a surety, unless it can be said that this
liability is placed upon the director against his will.

COOMBES v. GETZ.
434

Opinion of the Court.

Argument is hardly required to show that such is not the
case. The state could refuse to grant corporate franchises
altogether, or may grant on such terms as it pleases. The
right to do business as a corporation, or to be a director,
if I may speak of it as a right, is not a natural right.
These directors took office knowing the responsibilities
they assumed in so doing, and in the eye of the law did so
as freely and voluntarily as they would have done had
they signed a bond agreeing to be responsible for the
corporate officers."
The distinction between the section of the code and
the constitutional provision, therefore, is clear. In the
former the liability is wholly statutory; in the latter it is
contractual.
In Willcox v. Edwards, supra,the court had under consideration a constitutional provision repealing a former
provision of the constitution making valid certain contracts for the sale of stocks on margin. The right to sue
for the recovery of money paid under such a contract, the
court held, was not a vested right depending upon a quasi
contract arising by operation of law from the terms of the
original constitutional provision, but a right dependent
upon that provision standing alone; and that upon its
repeal, without a saving clause, pendin litigation fell for
want of authority to maintain it. But it plainly appears
that the decision would have been otherwise if the court
had deemed the right to be contractual.
Another case relied upon is Napa State Hospital v.
Flaherty, 134 Cal. 315; 66 Pac. 322, 323. There a state
statute made certain kindred of indigent insane persons
liable for their board at the insane asylum to which such
insane persons were committed. The right to maintain
an action for nonpayment was conferred upon the board
of trustees or directors. Such an action was brought;
but the court held that the remedy had been repealed and
the cause of action fell with it, putting its decision upon

the ground that "where a right is created solely by a
statute, and is dependent upon the statute alone, and
such right is still inchoate, and not reduced to possession,
or perfected by final judgment, the repeal of the statute
destroys the remedy, unless the repealing statute contains a saving clause."
The case here is entirely different. There the obligation which was imposed upon the relatives was purely
statutory. No act was contemplated on their part by
way of assumption of an obligation in order to fix the
liability. No element of a contract was present. Here
both parties acted. The creditor extended credit to the
corporation; and his action in so doing, under the state
constitutional provision, brought into force for his benefit the constitutional obligation of the director, which,
by becoming a director, the latter had voluntarily assumed and, thereby, in the eye of the law, created against
himself a contractual liability in the nature of a suretyship. Harrison v. Remington Paper Co., supra, p. 388.
Doubts which otherwise might have existed in respect
of the character and effect of the transaction are no
longer open. It is settled by decisions of this and other
federal courts (Ettor v. Tacoma, and cases cited in connection therewith, supra) that, upon the facts here disclosed, a contractual obligation arose; and the right to
enforce it, having become vested, comes within the protection of lboth the contract impairment clause in Art. 1,
§ 10, and the due process of law clause in the Fourteenth
Amendment, of the Federal Constitution.

I am unable to concur in the reversal of this judgment.

or misappropriated by the officers of such corporation or
joint stock association during the term of office of such
director or trustee" (Constitution. of California, Art. XIi,
section 3, repealed Nov. 4, 1930).
The Supreme Court of California has said that the
liability. thus created is contractual (Dean v. Shingle,
198 Cal. 652; 246 Pac. 1049) ; but only in a qualified sense,
as the expression of a legal fiction, is the statement true,
nor did the court that made it intend otherwise. The
liability would not b destroyed though the directors when
assuming office and repeatedly thereafter were to repudiate
the obligation utterly. They would be held for all their
protestations upon a liability imposed by law. Indeed,
they would have to answer to the creditors though they
had ceased to be directors before the debts were in existence. If we put aside deceptive labels, borrowed from the
law of quasi-contracts, the tangle is unraveled.' The petitioner had a contract with the cqrporation and not With
any one else (Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U.S. 142, 146), but
annexed by law to the obligation of that contract was a
liability purely statutory imposed on the directors (compare Christopher v. Norvell, 201 U. S. 216, 225; Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S. 516, 529). The decisions in
California., when analyzed, will be found to hold nothing to
the contrary. They amount merely to this, that the
liability created by the statute, which is enforcible also by
the shareholders, is not penal but remedial, and is limited
to the damage resulting to the corporation from the loss
of the embezzled moneys as if the director were a surety
to the corporation for the acts. of its defaulting officer
(Dean v. Shingle, supra; compare, Winchester v. Howard,
136 Cal. 432; 64 Pac. 692; 69 Pac. 77). In any event, this
Court is not controlled by the label which the state court
may affix to a liability growing out of a given state of
facts. It determines for itself whether within the meaning
of the Constitution the product is a contract to be pro137818*-32-29

tected by the power of the nation (Appleby v. New York,
271 U. S. 364, 380; Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582, 597).
As to this, its judgment is guided by realities and not by
words. The. section of the Constitution whereby contracts are secured against impairment is aimed at true
agreements, and not at quasi-contracts as distinguished
from agreements implied in fact (Crane v. Hahlo, 258
U. S. 142, 146; Louisiana v. New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285,
288). Here whatever duty was assumed by a director
through the acceptance of his office, was one that he owed
in the first instance to the corporation itself, though the
creditors and shareholders were privileged to enforce it
(Dean v. Shingle, supra). Payment to the corporation
before action brought would establish a defense, and even
after action brought, any surplus remaining would go into
the treasury. A distinction may exist between a liability
cast upon directors and one cast upon the shareholders,
who are quasi-partners in the venture (Comrning v. McCullough, 1 N. Y. (47). To develop the implications of
the distinction is unnecessary now.
I start then with the assumption that the petitioner
had a contract with a corporation secured in certain contingencies by a statutory liability. I add the assumption
that the State of California was not'at liberty, after the
contract had been made and a cause of action had accrued
thereunder, to make the security defeasible if it was indefeasible in its origin. Either the article of the Constitution prohibiting the impairment of contracts (U. S.
Constitution, Art. I, sec. 10) or the Fourteenth Amendment (which, however, is not invoked) might then stand
in the way (Hawthorne v. Calef, 2 Wall. 10; Steamship
Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450; Ettor v. Tacoma, 228 U. S. 148;
Forbes PioneerBoat Line v. Board of Commissioners, 258
U. S. 338). The difficulty with the petitioner's case is
this, that his security in its origin was not vested, but
contingent. The meaning of the California constitution

COOMBES v. GETZ.

.451

CARDOzO, J., dissenting.

is whatever the courts of California declare it to be. The
obligation of the petitioner's contract is whatever the law
of California attached to the contract at the hour of its
making. Long before that time, the Supreme Court of
.that State had held that under the law of California a
statutory cause of action, whether penal or remedial, may
be canceled or modified by repeal or amendment until it
has ripened into a judgment (Moss v. Smith, 171 Cal. 777,
788; 155 Pac. 90; Napa State Hospital v. Flaherty, 134
Cal. 315; 66 Pac. 322; WilIcox v. Edwards, 162 Cal. 455,
466; 123 Pac. 276; compare Coombes v. Franklin, 1 P.
(2d) 992; 4 P. (2d) 157, the decision under review). Consistent with these decisions is a provision of the Political
Code: "Any statute may be repealed at any time, except
when it is otherwise provided thlerein. Persons acting
under any statute are deemed to have acted in contemplation of this power of repeal" (California Political Code,
§ 327, quoted in Moss v. Smith, supra, at p. 787). I assume for present purposes that the rule thus announced
would be held of no effect if the statute and decisions declaring it had been made after Coombes became a creditor.
Made as they were before that time, they were reservations or conditions limiting the statutory liability, and to
be read into the statute, and hence into any contract to
which the statute was an incident, as if written there in
words (Citizens' Savings Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S.
636, 644; Farmers Bank v. Fed. Reserve Bank, 262 U. S.
649, 660). "The claim of an irrepealable contract cannot
be predicated upon a contract which is repealable'" (Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U. S. 322, 346).
Either the petitioner took his cause of action subject to
such infirmities or contingencies as were attached to it by
the law of the State of its creation, or 'he did not take
anything.
This view of the case puts aside as irrelevant the provision of the California constitution permitting the

UNITED STATES v. LEFKOWITZ

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 466.

Argued February 19, 23 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. A 'complaint charged that the defendants conspired to sell, possess, transport, furnish, deliver and take orders for intoxicating
liquors, contrary to the National Prohibition Act; and that as
part of the conspiracy, they were to use a designated room in
soliciting orders for the liquor, having it delivered by express companies or other carriers, collecting for it and sharing 'in the proceeds. Under a warrant of arrest issued upon the complaint, the
defendants were arrested in the room designated, which was used
as an office and was not alleged to be a place where liquor was,
or ever had been, manufactured, sold, kept or bartered, or which
contained fixtures or other things essential or intended to be used
for the sale of liquors to be consumed on the premises or otherwise. Upon making the arrests, the officers explored all desks,
cabinets, waste baskets, etc., for evidence of. guilt and found
various books, papers and other things intended. to be used in
soliciting orders for liqucr, which they took away. Held:
(1) The mere soliciting of orders from the room, in connection
with the other uses, alleged in the complaint, was not sufficient to
constitute maintenance of a nuisance therein. P. 462.
(2) There was no ground for saying that the accused were arrested while committing the crime of conspiracy or nuisance.
P. 463.
(3) The search was not justifiable as an incident of the arrests.
P. 463;
2. The Fourth Amendment forbids every search that is unreasonable
and is, construed liberally to safeguard the right of privacy. P. 464.
