Respondent filed returns in respect of capital stock
taxes for the years ending June 30 in 1923, 1924 and 1925
under § 1000 of the Revenue Act of 1921 and § 700 of
the Revenue Act of 1924.' The first two reported taxes
Section 1000 of the Act of 1921 is the samea, § 700 of the Act of
1924. Section 246 is the same in both Acts.

due. In the other, respondent claimed to be an insurance
company taxable under § 246, and consequently exempt
from the capital stock tax. It made returns and paid
income taxes for the calendar years 1921 to 1925 inclusive.
In February, 1926, respondent paid under protest the
capital stock taxes. It made application for refund and,
that being denied, brought this action in the district court
for eastern New York to recover the amounts so exacted.
The parties submitted the case on an agreed statement of
facts. The court gave judgment for the United States.
41 F. (2d) 793. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.
50 F. (2d) 107.
The question is whether during the periods for which
the capital stock taxes were paid, respondent was an insurance company taxable only under § 246.
Respondent was organized in 1906 under Article V of

the New York Insurance Law. It was formed to examine
and guarantee title to real estate, to lend money on real
estate mortgages and to guarantee such mortgages as to
payment of principal and interest and to do the work generally of a title insurance company. It is under the supervision of the state superintendent of insurance, subject
to the laws applicable to title and credit guaranty corporations, and maintains the required guaranty fund.
Its business has always consisted of issuing two kinds
of contracts: (1) those in which it merely guarantees title
and (2) those in which it guarantees (a) title to real
estate covered by a mortgageand (b) payment of prineip*l and interest of the debt. Preliminary to the issue of
title insurance policies first mentioned, respondent prepared abstracts and made examination of the title. Its
charges were bosed upon a scale dependent upon the
amounts of thi policies, and included fees for examinaboth are printed in the margin of our opinion in Bowers v. Lawyers
Mortgage,Co., ante, p. 182, and need not be repeated here.

tions, searches and other service incident to the transaction. Policies guaranteeing both title and payment of
such mortgage debts were issued substantially as follows:
When respondent received an application for a loan, it
made an appraisal of the property and an examination
of the title. Upon its approval of the application, it
received from the borrower his bond and mortgage and
paid him the amount of the bond, less charges for services
incidental to title insurance and also for inspection and
appraisal of the property. The fee covering title insurance was made a condition of every loan. Respondent
did not charge any lending fee.
It sold the loans at face value and delivered to the
purchaser of each a mortgage guaranty or, in case of the
sale of part of a loan, a participation certificate. By
every such guaranty or certificate, the purchaser appointed
respondent his agent to collect principal and interest of
the loan, and the latter guaranteed (1) the mortgage to
be a valid first lien upon a good and marketable title
in fee, (2) payment of principal when collected and in
any event within 12 months after maturity and (3) paymnent of interest at a rate usually one-half of one per cent.
less than that specified in the bond. The difference was
called premium. Generally, about two months elapsed
between the making of loans and their sale. The interest
for that period was retained by respondent and constituted a part of its gross income.
It never held nor sold mortgages that were not acquired
and guaranteed as above stated and never guaranteed
other than those controlled by it. Its expenses were not
assigned to its different classes of business, and its assets
were used indiscriminately in connection with all its activities. Corporations organized under New York banking
laws and subject to the supervision of the banking department are authorized to make mortgage loans and sell
them with guaranties such as those given by respondent,

and from 1921 to 1925 at least two companies thus
organized and supervised were engaged in that business.
Respondent's policies merely guaranteeing title
amounted to more than six times its mortgage guaranties.
A tabular statement in the margin makes the comparison.'
Its title insurance, not connected with mortgage guaranties, outstanding in each of the five years amounted to
more than $100,000,000. Another table I states its gross
income from sources other than interest, rents, dividends
and profits on sale of bonds, and classifies such income so
as to show: (1) the difference between interest received
and that guaranteed by respondent; (2) fees and charges
attributable to mortgage guaranties; (3) fees and charges
attributable to title insurance where respondent did not

Syllabus.

make nor guarantee mortgages or loans; (4) compensation
for guaranteeing mortgages to be first liens upon titles in
fee; (5) income from mortgage renewals; etc.
The guaranty of payment of the principal and interest
of mortgage loans constitutes insurance. Bowers v. Lawyers Mortgage Co., ante, p. 182. The amounts received
as compensation for insuring title, for guaranteeing that
mortgages are first liens and for guaranteeing payment constitute the larger part of respondent's income.
And, when there are added the fees and charges for examination of title, appraisals, and other services incident
to its insurance business, the total properly assignable
to that business amounts to more than 75 per cent. of
all respondent's income. Undeniably insurance is its
principal business. Indeed, it does not appear that any
substantial part of its transactions was not connected with
or the outgrowth of insurance. The admitted facts
clearly show that in the tax years above mentioned respondent was an "insurance company" within the meaning of that phrase as commonly understood and as used
in the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924. It was taxable
under § 246 and therefore exempt from capital stock
taxes.
