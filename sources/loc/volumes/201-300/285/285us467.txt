SHRIVER V. WOODBINE SAVINGS BANK.
APPEAL

No. 158.

FROM

THE SUPREME

COURT OF IOWA.

Submitted December 3, 1931.-Argued March 14, 15,
1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. An objection to a state statute upon the ground that it places on
a stockholder an obligation to pay assessments not imposed by the
statutes in force when he acquired his stock invokes the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the contract
clause of the Constitution. P. 474.
2. A party making this objection based on the Fourteenth Amendment must show that the statutes existing when his contract was
made did not impose the obligation laid by the later statute;
and if this is doubtful upon the face of the statutes and for want
of an authoritative construction by the state court, the objection
will not be entertained. P. 475.
3. When the statutes in force when a stockholder of a bank acquired
his stock make him liable to pay assessments to restore impairments of the bank's capital, the obligation may be enforced, in the
absence of an exclusive statutory remedy, by a common-law action
of debt, or its modern equivalent. P. 476.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Argument for Appellant.

4. The mere fact that the statutes defining the stockholder's liability
to pay create a special remedy for collecting the assessments by
sale of his shares does not imply that this is to be exclusive (the
statutes not so declaring) and that the more plenary remedy by
common-law action is withheld. P. 477.
5. The enactment of a statute specifically authorizing suit against
stockholders for deficiencies after sale of their stock to pay assessments can not be taken as a legislative determination that under
the earlier statutes no common-law remedy for the collection of
assessments existed. P. 479.
6. Mere variations of the remedy, or the creation of new ones, even
though more onerous, for the enforcement of a pre-existing obligation to pay assessments in full, are unobjectionable. Id.

Messrs. H. B. Claypool and W. E. Wallace, with whom
Mr. James M. Parsons was on the brief, for appellant.
Where a statute creates a right, and provides a special
remedy, that remedy is exclusive. This is the general rule
of construction. Carondelet v. Picot, 38 Mo. 125; Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520, 527; Andover & Medford
Corp. v. Gould, 6 Mass. 40; DollarSavings Bank v. United
States, 19 Wall. 227, 238; Jefferson County Farm Bureau

Iowa 296; Lease v. Vance, 28 Iowa 509; Conrad v. Starr,

26 N. J. L. 398; Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker, 210
U. S. 356.
The rule is founded upon the thought that where the
legislature designates the remedy it impliedly prohibits
any other and thus limits the liability. United States v.
Stevenson, 215 U. S. 190; Dollar Savings Bank v. United
States, 19 Wall. 227, 238. Cf. Davis v. Mills, 194 U.S.

SHRIVER v. WOODBINE BANK.

Argument for Appellant.

The- Iowa Act in its original form and. as codified did
not in terms impose a personal liability on shareholders
to pay the assessment. It. was optional with the shareholder. He had the right to pay the assessment and protect his stock, otherwise he lost sufficient of 'his stock-to
pay the assessment. The Iowa legislature in this Act did
not use'any language appropriate to create a. personal
liability.
Surely where the legislature is creating a liability, its
language is not to be extended by construction. Bruns-.
wick Terminal Co. v. National Bank, 192 U. S. 386, 390;
Alexander v. Crosby, 143 Iowa 50, 54; Highway Trailer
Co. v. Janesville Electric Co., 187 Wis. 161.
If it had been the intent of the legislature to create a
personal liability against the shareholder for the assessment, it would have used language such as "it shall be
the duty of the stockholder to pay," "the shareholder.
shall pay," "the shareholder shall be liable;" or similar
language. Chester Glass Co.'v. Dewey, 16 Mass. 94, 101;
Mechanics Machine Go. v. Hail, 121 Mass. 272, 275;
Land Co. v. Hernegan, 126 Mass. '155; Ca'rondeletv. Picot,
28 Mo. 125.
It will be noticed, that in § 3 of this Act (25 G. A., c.
29) the legislature used the term "individually liable"
when providing the liability of bank directors-who failed
to proceed and make the assessment.
It is not reasonable to say that 'a shareholder was personally liable for the assessment to restore impaired
capital after his stock had been sold. The sale of the
stock terminated his relationship with the corporation.
The statute, passed in 1925, does expressly provide for a
personal liability after sale of the stock, and also provides
a remedy by suit.
The Iowa court has held in other cases that therewas no
personal liability upon stockholders under the statutes
prior to the enactment. of § 9248-al Code, 1927. Leach

JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellee, an Iowa banking corporation, brought suit in
the courts of that State to enforce the personal liability
of appellant, its stockholder, for an assessment made under
the Iowa statutes, which provide for the restoration of
any impairment of capital of a bank, by assessment pro
rata of the stockholders. The case comes here on appeal,
Jud. Code § 237, from a judgment of the Iowa Supreme
Court sustaining the assessment and upholding the statute, which is assailed as infringing the contract and due
process clauses of the Federal Constitution. 212 Ia. 196.
On different dates between 1891 and 1917, appellant
acquired twenty-six shares of the capital stock of the appellee. Appellee, originally incorporated in 1891, was reincorporated in 1911, appellant acquiring a like number
of shares in the new corporation. At that time the liability to assessment of the stockholders in the bank was
controlled by §§ 1878, 1879, and 1880 of the 1897 Iowa
Code, now appearing as §§ 9246-9250 of the 1927 Iowa
Code. These sections authorize the superintendent of
banks to require any impairment of capital of a state bank
to be restored by an assessment upon its stockholders, as
directed by an appropriate order of the superintendent,
"fixing the amount of the assessment." Section 9247 imposes on the directors a duty to cause the deficiency in
capital, thus determined, to be made good "by a ratable

SHRIVER v. WOODBINE BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

assessment upon the stockholders, for the amount of stock
held by them," and requires the proper officers of the bank
to give written notice of the assessment, addressed to the
several stockholders, which "shall state the entire sum to
be raised and the amount due from the addressed stockholder." Section 9248 provides:
"Should any stockholder neglect or refuse to pay his
assessment within ninety days from the date of mailing
notice thereof, the board of directors shall cause a sufficient amount of the capital stock held by such stockholder
to be sold at public auction to make good the deficiency,
after giving ten days' notice thereof by personal service
or by posting the same in the bank, and publishing it in
some newspaper of the county in which the bank is located, which notice shall recite the assessment made, the
amount due thereunder from the stockholder, and the
time and place of sale; proof of all which may be made in
the manner provided in the preceding section."
After appellant had acquired his stock, a new section was
added by the Act of March 13, 1925, c. 181, Iowa Laws,
1925, now § 9248-a (1) of the 1927 Iowa Code, reading
as follows:
"Should the proceeds of a sale under the preceding
section of all of the stock of any stockholder be insufficient
to satisfy his entire assessment liability, he shall be personally liable for the deficiency, which may be collected
by suit brought in the name of the bank against such
stockholder."
Following the adoption of this later section, the Superintendent of Banks determined that appellee's capital
had been impaired 100% and directed an assessment accordingly. Acting under § 9248, appellee's directors sold
appellant's stock for $1.00 a share, and the present suit
was brought to recover the deficiency..
In answer to the objection that the Act of 1925 subjected appellant .to an unconstitutional burden, appellee

relies on the statutes antedating appellant's acquisition
of his stock, as imposing on him personal liability to pay
the assessment, without the aid of the quoted provision
of the later Act. It also argues that even if there was
no such liability under the earlier st atutes, the adoption
of the Act. of 1925 was but an exercise of the power reserved to the legislature by § 12, Art. 8 of the Iowa Constitution, and by § 1612 of. the 1897 Iowa Code (§ 1090
Iowa Code of 1873), providing that '.' the articles of incorporation, by-laws, rules and regulations of, corporations
hereafter organized . . shall at all. times be subjec t to
legislative control, and may be at any time altered,

the power. thus reserved embraces not only a legislative
withdrawal of any grant of immunity to the stockholders
of the bank, from liability for its debts, but extends to
the imposition on'them of a new and continuing liability
to pay any assessment levied for the restoration of capital of the bank.
The Supreme Court of Iowa found it unnecessary to
pass upon these contentions. Expressly disclaiming any
purpose to decide either of them, it assumed,: for purposes:
of decision, that under the earlier statutes the deficiency
after sale of the stock could not be collected from the
stockholder. It then proceeded to. point out that from
the beginning the authorized assessments were not upon
the stock of the bank, but upon the stockholders personally, and said, 212 Iowa 196, 201, 202; 236 N. W. 10, 12:
"According to the original statute, the stockholder was
personally and primarily liable for the assessment, and
section 9248 and its predecessors had to do only with the
remedy and nothing else. Then, assuming that the only
remedy originally made for the collection of. the assessment was to confiscate the stockholder's stock, nevertheless, so far as the remedy Was sufficient, the stockhold' r
was personally liable for the assessment.. This burden

SHRIVER v. WOODBINE BANK
467

Opinion of the .Court.

was cast upon the stockholder himself, even though the
only remedy to enforce- the obligation was by the sale of
the stock... Consequently, appellant's obligation in the
premises had not been increased. He was always obligated to pay the assessment. Of course, if he did not pay,
the only remedy under the statute was to sell his stock;
yet the obligation to pay was there just the same. Now,
under the new legislation, the stockholder's liability has
not been increased, but rather the remedy for enforcing
that obligation has been changed. Were the remedy a
part of appellant's contract, a change thereof would
amount to an impairment. Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U. S.
118; Conley v, Barton, 260 U. S. 677.
"Obviously in the case at bar, however, we are not
confronted with a case where the remedy became a part
of the contractual obligation. There is not a syllable in
the statutory contract which in any way indicates that
the remedy is a part of the agreement. It was not said
by the legislature that there could be no other or different
remedy. Hence it was perfectly proper for the law making body to adopt section 9248-a (1) of the 1927 Code,
because such amendatory legislation pertained to the
remedy only. The purpose of this legislative enactment
was to afford a more appropriate remedy for an obligation
already existing against appellant. Ever since becoming
a stockholder of the appellee bank, he was obligated to
pay any legal assessment made for the purpose of repairing the capital stock. This new legislation simply recognized that obligation and afforded a more complete remedy
to enforce the same. No new obligation was created by
the amendment, but rather the old was recognized and a
better way to enforce it provided."
We find it unnecessary to answer the question implicit
in this disposition of the case, whether an obligation can
be said to exist apart from a remedy to enforce it-whether
within the meaning of the contract clause any personal

285 U.S.

obligation of a stockholder in the nature-of a contract to
restore his pro rata share of any impairment of the corporate capital, can be said to exist independently of some
means or remedy for enforcing it, in addition to the sale of
his stock.
Nor are we called on to discuss here the suggestion that
even though the sale of the stock was the only means of
collecting assessments, the contract and due process
clauses do not guarantee appellant against the selection
and .the application to him of any other remedy reasonably adapted to carrying out the policy and purpose
plainly declared by the earlier statute, to require complete
restoration of any impairment of corporate capital by
assessment of the stockholders. See Henley v. Myers, 215
U. S. 373; League v. Texas, 184 U. S. 156, 158; Graham &
Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 426; Milliken v. United
States, 283 U. S. 15, 20 et seq.; People v. Adams State
Bank, 272 Ill. 277; 111 N. E. 989; Irvine v. Elliott, 203
Fed. 82, 96-97. For we conclude that appellant does not
sustain the burden which rests on him of establishing that
the later statute is unconstitutional because imposing a
liability to which he was not subject under the earlier one.
In strictness, appellant presents no question of impairment of the obligation of contract, for it is not insisted
that either party has been deprived by legislative action
of any right or remedy secured by the statute in force
when appellant acquired his stock. His objection is not
directed to any such impairment of right or obligation.
It is rather that the Act of 1925 imposed on him a personal obligation where none existed before, and that its
imposition, by fiat of the law, after he had bought his
stock, operates to deprive him of property without due
process of law. See League v. Texas, supra,pp. 158, 161.
This contention is, of course, without support if the liability to pay the full assessment declared by the earlier stat-

SHRIVER v. WOODBINE BANK.
467

Opinion of the Court.

ute was then enforcible by any approlriate form of
remedy. See Pinney v. Nelson, 183 U. S. 144, 147; Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, 176 U. S.559; Thomas v.
Matthiessen, 232 U. S. 221.
The Supreme Court of Iowa has given no authoritative
answer to the question whether, before the Act of 1925,
there was any remedy other than sale of the stock by
which an assessment might be recovered from a stockholder. In the present case it did not decide the question, contenting itself with the observation that "the
only remedy under the statute was to sell his stock."
In two earlier cases, arising long after appellant acquired
his stock, it had expressed the view that the only remedy
for enforcing the payment of assessments was by sale
of the shareholder's stock. See Leach v. Arthur Savings
Bank, 203 Iowa 1052, 1057; 213 N. W. 772; Andrew v.
People's State Bank, 211 Iowa 649; 234 N. W. 542, 546.
But in neither was this statement necessary to the decision, nor did it have any bearing on the question actually
decided. Both followed the passage of the Act of 1925.
In no other cited case has the question been considered.
Where legislation is assailed as impairing the obligation of contract, this Court, in defining the scope of the
constitutional immunity, will determine for itself what
the contract is for whose protection the immunity is
invoked. See Appleby v. New York, 271 U. S.364, 379,
380. In the circumstances of this case, also, where the
alleged infringement .of the Fourteenth Amendment turns
on the asserted non-existence of a contractual obligation
to do that which the challenged statute exacts, appellant
must satisfy this Court that he was not so bound. For,
here, the nature and extent of his obligation depend upon
the construction of a local statute which the highest court
of the state has indicated by its latest decision is still
open for determination. See Brunswick Terminal Co. v.

476

285 U.S.

National Bank of Baltimore, 192 U. S. 386, 392 et seq.;
cf. Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina,281 U. S.
537, 540.
The meaning of the sections now in question hust be
ascertained in the light of the legislative policy of the
state. They are a part of its public laws, dealing with a
subject of public concern, the stability and solvency of
state banking institutions. See Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104, 111, 112; Bank of Oxford v. Love,
250 U. S. 603. Those laws confer on the Superintendent
of Banks full authority to require a bank to restore impairments of its capital. § 9235 Iowa Code of 1927 (§ 1572
Iowa Code of 1873). He may cause its liquidation if it
refuses to comply with his order or is in an insolvent or
unsafe condition, or the interests of creditors require it
to be closed. §§ 9238, 9239 Iowa Code of 1927 (§ 1572

Iowa Code of 1873).

The stockholders are made indi-

vidually liable to creditors, §§ 9251-9252 Iowa Code of
1927 (§ 1882 Iowa Code of 1897); and any bank, whether
its charter has expired or not, may be dissolved by vote of
three-fourths of the stockholders. § 9277 Iowa Code of
1927 (§ 1857 Iowa Code of 1897).
These sections exhibit an unmistakable purpose to
maintain the banks of the state in a solvent condition with
capital unimpaired, which is specifically given effect by
§§ 9246-9248 of the 1927 Code. By these sections the
appellant was made aware, when he acquired his stock,
that in the event of any impairment of capital of the
bank, the Superintendent of Banks, was, authorized to
"require an assessment upon the stockholders" and to
fix "the amount of the assessment required "; that the
directors of the bank could be ordered by the Superintendent to "cause such a deficiency to be made good by a
ratable assessment upon the stockholders "; that the officers of the corporation were required to give notice to
each stockholder of "the entire sum to be raised and the

467

Opinion of the Court.

amount due from the addressed stockholder "; and that
after 90 days, allowed for the payment of the assessment,
his stock might be sold upon an. advertisement required to
"recite the assessment made and the amount due thereunder from the stockholder." These are phrases importing legal liability. They define an obligation imposed by
the statute upon the stockholders to pay the assessments
to the bank, see Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, 176
U. S. 559, 562, by which alone the complete restoration of
impaired capital, which is the legislative purpose, could
be secured with certainty.
If no specific remedy of any kind had been provided to
compel payment of assessments, there could be little doubt
that the effect of these provisions would have been to
create an obligation or liability, quasi-contractual in nature, on the part of stockholders acquiring, their stock
after the enactment, to pay to the bank a sum certain,
that is, the assessment when made, for which the common
law affords a remedy in debt or indebitatus assumpsit or
its modern equivalent. See Mills v. Scott, 99 U. S. 25;
Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, 176 U. S. 559; Flash
v. Conn, 109 U. S. 371; Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S.
516, 529; Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 500;
United States v. Chamberlin, 219 U. S.250; Meredith v.
United States, 13 Pet. 486, 493; Steamship Co. v. Jolifje,
2 Wall. 450, 457; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S.243,

N. W. 520. See James B. Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Implied Assumpsit, 149, 161.
In the face of the sweeping language of the statute, the
mere fact that it gave a remedy by sale of the stock cannot
be taken as necessarily precluding resort to the common
law remedy, which would otherwise be available and by
which alone the liability declared could in many cases be
successfully enforced. The summary remedy by a sale
would often be a speedy and convenient alternative

285 U.S.

method of enforcing the statutory liability to pay assessments. But it is not stated to be exclusive and its adoption involves no necessary inconsistency with the continued existence of a common law remedy for the recovery
of the sum certain fixed by the assessment and declared to
be due by the statute. In those instances where the impairment is more than 50% of the capital, the remedy by
sale would be insufficient to enforce the liability declared.
No reason is suggested why such a remedy should, by mere
implication, be deemed exclusive or why the statute
should be so construed by inference as to defeat its obvious purpose, or limit or destroy the liability which, in
plain terms, it has created.
It is true that where a statute creates a liability and
provides a remedy by suit specially adapted to its enforcement, other less appropriate common law remedies
are impliedly excluded. See Evans v. Nellis, 187 U. S.
271; Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520, 527; Williamson v.
American Bank, 115 Fed. 793; cf. Middletown Bank v.
Railway Co., 197 U. S. 394. And in every case conditions
precedent to the statutory liability must be satisfied before any form of remedy can be resorted to. Fourth
National Bank v. Francklyn, 120 U. S. 747; Middletown
Bank v. Railway Co., supra; State National Bank v.
Sayward, 91 Fed. 443. But here the conditions of liability, the order of the Superintendent of Banks, the assessment by the directors, and the notice fixing the amount of
appellant's obligation, have all been performed. Here,
,he remedy provided is a summary and only partially
'effective supplement or alternative to that which the common law affords for enforcing the obligation to pay a sum
certain, which, when fixed by the prescribed assessment, is
declared to be due and owing. The very fact that the
remedy is on its face inadequate to compel full performance of the obligation declared, is persuasive that it was

SHRIVER v. WOODBINE BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

not intended to be exclusive of applicable common law
remedies, by which complete performance might be
secured.
Administrative remedies for the collection of taxes, if
not made exclusive by statute, do not preclude the recovery of the tax by a common law action of debt. Price
v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 500; United States v.
Chamberlin, 219 U. S.250, 262; Dollar Savings Bank v.
United States, 19 Wall. 227, 238-239; Meredith v. United
States, 13 Pet. 486, 493; see Stockwell v. United States,
13 Wall. 531, 542. And in general the liability of stockholders to assessment under local statutes is deemed transitory in nature, enforcible by common law remedies in
states other than that of the corporation, although special
statutory forms of remedy given by the local statute could
not be resorted to elsewhere. See Whitman v. Oxford
National Bank, 176 U. S. 559; Hancock National Bank v.
Farnum, 176 U. S. 640; Hale v. Hardon, 95 Fed. 747;

certain what may previously have been thought by some
to be uncertain. But it can hardly be taken to be a legislative determination that under the earlier statutes no
common law remedy could be availed of for the collection of assessments. If not, mere "4ariatidns of the remedy or the creation of new ones, even though more onerous, for the enforcement of a pre-existing. obligation to
pay assessments in full, are unobjectionable. See Hill v.

PACIFIC CO., LTD. v. JOHNSON, STATE
TREASURER.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 270.

Argued January 8, 1932. Reargued March 17, 1932.-Decided April 11, .1932.

A California corporation acquired municipal bonds at a time when,
by- the state constitution, they were declared to be "free and
exempt from taxation." Subsequently, pursuant to a change in
the constitution, a statute subjected the corporation to a tax on
the privilege of doing business in the State, measured by a specified
percentage of its net income, in the computation of which the
statute directed the inclusion of " all interest received from federal,
state, municipal or other bonds." Held (assuming that the exemption was contractual and extended to the income derived from
the bonds exempted):
1. That the tax immunity granted was not broad enough to
secure freedom from taxation of the corporate franchise measured
by the tax-exempt income, and therefore the obligation of the bond
contracts was not impaired by. the tax. Pp. 489-491.
2. In the absence of applicable state decisions antedating the
alleged impairment of contract, the extent of the tax exemption
is to be decided by the aid of generally accepted principles of
construction. P. 489.
3. Until the adoption of the constitutional amendment in 1928
(§ 16, Arft XIII), and of the Bank and Corporation Franchise
Tax Act (Cal. Stats., 1929, c. 13, p. 19), there was no provision
in California for taxing corporate franchises by the method here
in question; and, until this case, no decision of any court of the
