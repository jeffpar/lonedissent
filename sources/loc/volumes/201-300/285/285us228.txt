petitioner's participation as counsel, still it would defeat,
not aid, the administration of justice in the principal
cause to encourage petitioner's voluntary presence by the
grant of an immunity which would relieve him from any
compulsion either to continue his presence or to answer
for his acts affecting the progress of the cause. Judicial
necessities require that such immunity should be withheld, and it was rightly denied by the court below.
It is said that the service of process in this case cannot
be deemed an exception to the general rule without assuning the truth of the allegations in the bill of coinplaint, and that the truth or falsity of the pleadings cannot be assumed. See Page v. MacDonald, supra, pp.
448-449. But the test of the privilege is not the probable success or failure of the suit or proceeding in which
the process was served. If it were, the immunity could
never be denied. The test is whether the immunity itself, if allowed, would so obstruct judicial administration
in the very cause for the protection of which it is invoked
as to justify withholding it. That, as we have said, depends here upon the nature of the proceeciing in which
the service is made and its relation to the principal suit,
both of which are disclosed by the pleadings.

General Thacher, Assistant Attorney General Youngquist,

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioners iii these cases, members of a law partnership, filed their individual tax returns for the calendar
year 1924. The partnership books were kept on the basis
of a fiscal year and the partnership information return,
filed in 1924, was for the fiscal year ending April 30th of
that year. As required by 218 (a) of the Revenue Act
of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253. 275, the petitioners included
in their individual returns their respective shares of the
partnership profits for the partnership year ending in
1924. They thus returned, as 1924 income, partnership
profits attributable to eight months of the previous year.

Opinion of the Court.

285 U.S.

In assessing the tax, the Commissioner rejected their
claim that, under the provisions of Title XII of the Revenue Act of 1924, they were entitled to a reduction of
25% of the tax at. 1923 rates on that portion of their respective shares of the partnership income attributable to
the eight months of the partnership year, which fell in
the calendar year 1923, and found deficiencies accordingly.
The orders of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the
action of the Commissioner, 18 B. T. A. 393, were affirmed
by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 52 F.
(2d) 17. This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the decision below and that of the Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit, in White v. Maddison, 45 F.
(2d) 335.
The provisions of Title XII of the Revenue Act of 1924
embody a comprehensive scheme for relieving taxpayers
from the burdens of the higher rates applicable to 1923
income under the 1921 Act. The 1924 Act reduced the
rates, but became a law too late in the year to make them
readily applicable to income earned in the previous year.
Instead, it adopted the less scientific, but more convenient,
plan of a, level reduction of 25% of the tax. In making
it, Congress was careful to limit the reduction to taxes
on income returned for 1923. The applicable provisions
are found in §§ 1200 (a) and 1201 (a) and (b) of the 1924
Act.' Section 1200 (a) authorized the allowance to tax'"Sec. 1200 (a). Any taxpayer making return, for the calendar year
1923, of the taxes imposed by Parts I and II of Title II of the Revenue Act of 1921 shall be entitled to an allowance by credit or refund
of 25 per centum of the amount shown as the tax upon his return.
"See. 1201 (a). Any taxpayer making return, for a period beginning
in 1922 and ending in 1923, of the taxes imposed by Parts I and II of
Title II of the Revenue Act of 1921, shall be entitled to an allowance
by credit or refund of 25 per centum of the same proportion of his
tax for such period (determined under the law applicable to the calendar year 1923 and at the rates for such year) which the portion of
such period falling within the calendar year 1923 is of the entire
period.

Opinion of the Court.

payers making a return of income for the calendar year
1923. Section 1201 (a) and (b) granted it to taxpayers
returning income for a fiscal year beginning or ending
in 1923, but only with respect to the tax on so much of
the income returned as was attributable to income earned
in the calendar year 1923.
Petitioners' claims for the allowance plainly are not
comprehended by the language of either section. They
made their returns on the calendar year basis, and were
entitled to, and presumably received, the allowance authorized by § 1200 (a) upon the tax on income returned
for the calendar year 1923. But this section does not
authorize any reduction of the tax upon income returned
for the calendar year 1924, as was that of petitioners.
Section 1201 (a) and (b) applies only to taxpayers returning income for a fiscal year beginning or ending in
1923. The petitioners, who made no such returns, were
thus excluded from the benefits of the 25% reduction
of the tax on any part of their income returned for the
calendar year 1924 by the unambiguous language of these
sections. See Crooks v. Harrelson,282 U. S. 55, 60, 61.
They argue that the provisions of these sections applicable to income returned for 1923, evidence a general
purpose to allow the reduction of tax upon any income
attributable to that year. Hence, despite the language
of § 1201 (b) restricting its benefits to those returning
income for taxation for some part of the year 1923,
they insist that it should be deemed to extend to taxes
on partnership income attributable to 1923, although in
"(b) Any taxpayer making return, for a period beginning in 1923
,and ending in 1924, of the taxes imposed by Parts I and II of Title II
of this Act, shall be entitled to an allowance by credit or refund of
25 per centum of the same proportion of a tax for such period (determined under the law applicable to the calendar year 1923 and at the
rates for such year) which the portion of such period falling within
the calendar year 1923 is of the entire period."

fact income in 1924, and returned by the taxpayers as
such in their 1924 returns.
Even if there were room for construction of the words
of the statute, it is impossible to discern any such general purpose underlying the 1924 Act as would support
petitioners' contention. There are two insuperable obstacles to the constructioni urged. The first is the necessary effect of § 1200 (a) when applied to returns of taxpayers for the calendar year 1923. That section authorizes a r luction of 25, of the taxes for 1923 upon all income, including that derived from partneiships having a
fiscal year beginning in 1922 and ending in 1923., Thus
applied, it allows 25' reduction of petitioners' 1923 tax,
including that upon their partnership income, attributable
to eight months of 1922. If, as they insist, § 1201 (b) is
to be construed as permitting a like reduction of the 1924
tax on partnership income attributable to the last eight
months of the calendar year 1923. which wv'eil'apped the
partnership year ending in 1924, petitioners, lespite the
careful limit:tioli of the redu't ion to taxes npon income
for a ingle year, would be entitled to a reduction of the
tax on partfnersiip income for a period of more than a
year, in this ease tweity moiths, eight months of 1922
and te full twelve monthlhs of 1923.
A second objection to 'he suggested construction of
1201 (b) is that if the reduci ion, for which it provides,
were extended to the tax involved here, it would not necessarily result in a return of 25 ,, of the tax assessed, as is
.1lhe obvious purpl)(se of the section. Section 1201 (a) and
(b),'allows the 253;. reduct il on that proportion of the
tax for the entire year, computed at 1923 rates, which the
period of the fiscal ycar falling within the calendar year
1923 bears to the entire taxable year. As this is the same
basis on which the tax is computed, under § 207 (a) of
the 1924 Act, where the taxable year begins in 1923 and

SHEARER v. BURNET.

Opinion of the Court.

ends in 1924, the reduction is exactly 25% of the tax
assessed.
A different method of computing the tax on a distributive share of partnership income for a partnership fiscal
year beginning in 1923 and ending in 1924, is prescribed
by § 207 (b) of the 1924 Act. Under that section the
tax computed for the fiscal year at 1923 rates is not, as
under § 207 (a), apportioned to the number of months
of the fiscal year which fall in the calendar year 1923.
Instead, § 207 (b) applies the 1923 schedule of rates to
the income apportioned to 1923, and the 1924 schedule
to the income apportioned to 1924. And for purposes of
the surtax it places the income from the partnership subject to the 1924 rates in the lower brackets and the income
subject to the 1923 rates in the higher brackets.
The difference in method of calculating the tax on the
two classes of income may produce different amounts
of tax on the same amount of income. The tax computed
under § 207 (a) upon income of an individual taxpayer
attributable to the first eight months of a fiscal year
ending April 30, 1924, would be exactly two-thirds of the
total tax, and it is to the two-thirds of this total to which
the 25% reduction is applied by § 1201 (b). If applica
ble to the present case, the reduction would likewise be
allowed on two-thirds of the tax for the entire year at
1923 rates. But the tax calculated under § 207 (b), on
income derived from the partnership, for the same eight
months of 1923, would be more than two-thirds of the.
total tax for the year, because of the higher rate of surtax
applicable to the income attributed to 1923 than to the
income apportioned to 1924.
The reduction of the tax calculated as prescribed by
§ 1201 (b) would accordingly not be 25% of the tax. The
section, if construed to extend the reduction to a tax computed as was the petitioners', would thus depart from the

obvious purpose and definite scheme of the 1924 Act to
return uniformly to taxpayers 25% of the tax on income
of a single year. Undoubtedly Congress might have included the tax on this income of petitioners in its scheme
for refunding taxes. Its failure to do so is doubtless a
consequence of the fact already noted that it did make
provision for reduction of the like tax on the income for
the corresponding months of 1922.
Assuming that petitioners can invoke the protection
of the Fifth Amendment to secure an equable share of a
credit or refund of a tax after its assessment, we can
discern in this statute no want of due process of law.
The petitioners are within a defined class which Congress
clearly had power to select for purposes of a tax refund.
