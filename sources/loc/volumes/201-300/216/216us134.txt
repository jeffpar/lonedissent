written contracts caused -b mutual mistake is not suspended by

189 N. Y. 533, affirmed.,

THIS was a suit brought in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York by the First National Bank of Waterloo against
Francis Bacon and George E. Zartman, as Bacon's trustee
in bankruptcy,.to procure the reformation of a written contract
made by plaintiff and defendant Bacon February 15, 1902..
Before the contract was made, Bacon was president of the
First National Bank. of Waterloo, New York, and also of the
Waterloo Wagon Company. He was active ifi the, office of
the Wagon. Company, while the business of the bank was
looked after by its cashier BeckerK The Waterloo Bank had
extended, credit to the Wagon Company' and to Bacon- individually, discounting paper and taking notes.
The Exchange National Bank of Seneca Falls, New York,

held, by assignment from Bacon, 461 shares of the stock of
the Wagon Company and 253 shares of the Waterloo Bank,
as continuing collateral security for any existing or future
indebtedness of Bacon or the Wagon Company.
The contract between Bacon and the Waterloo Bank provided that the shares were "to be held by said',bank as a
continuing collateral security for the payment to it of any
indebtedness or liability of any kind, absolute or contingent,
due or not due, now existing or that may hereafter exist,
arise, accrue or be contracted, on the part of himself or of the
Waterloo Wagon Company Limited, to said bank, and the
said Francis Bacon hereby agrees with the First National
Bank of Waterloo that the said certificates of stock above
named are transferred to and may be held by the said First
National Bank of Waterloo as a continuing collateral security
for the payment to it of any indebtedness or liability of any
kind, absolute or contingent, now existing or that mqy hereafter exist, arise, accrue or be contracted on the part of the
Waterloo Wagon Company Limited, or himself, to said bank
and said shares of stock upon their surrender by the Exchange
National Bank shall be deposited with the said First National
Bank of Waterloo."
The words in italics were omitted from the contract by
mutual mistakes made in preparing and executing it, and the
New York Supreme Court, by its decision, reformed the contract by inserting them. In the meantime, however, Bacon
had become a bankrupt, having been so adjudicated May 4,
1904, and defendant Zartman had been appointed trustee.
This action was begun October 17, 1904. The trustee alone
defended.
The judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate
Division of the Fourth Department, 113 App. Div. 612, and
on appeal to the Court of Appeals the decision of the Appellate
Division was unanimously affirmed without opinion. 189
N. Y. 533. The remittitur was filed below November 9, 1907,
and this writ of error was thereupon allowed.

Mr. George E. Zartman pro se for plaintiff in error:
The interest which the trustee took could not be diminished
by the action of the court; reformation of the contract would
be in direct violation of the bankrupt act. Under ยง67a
claims which for want of record or for other reasons could not
have been valid liens as against the claims of the creditors
of the bankrupt shall not be liens against his estate.
No lien in this case could be created on the stock affected
except by delivery, and there was no delivery in this case.

The rights of the trustee as representing the receiver were

The judgment reforming the contract created a new lien,
and both judgment and lienare void as against the trustee.
Mr. W. H. Sholes for defendant in error:

'the estate of the bankrupt and that he takes the same kind
of title as a bona fide purchaser for value. This is error, for
the rule is, that the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt not as an innocent purchaser would, but as the debtor
had it at the time of the petition, subject to all valid claims,
liens and equities. T4Winsor v. McClellan, 2 Story, 492; Donaldson v. Farwell, 93 U. S. (131; Casey v. La Societe de Credit

or national, which connects the question involved in this case
with any rule or regulation concerning the filing or recording
of any paper whatever. No such question is here in any form.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after making the foregoing
statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The jurisdiction in equity to decree the correction of errors
in written contracts which have been caused by mutual mistake is firmly established and needs no citation of authority
to sustain it. In the present case the evidence of the mistakes
in question was undisputed. We are not aware that the bankruptcy law has suspended .that jurisdiction.
The position of the trustee in bankruptcy seems to be that
-the mistake made by B~acon in dictating or writing out the
contract between himself and the Waterloo Bank "is an asset
in his hands as part of the estate of the'bankrupt," but we
cannot agree to that. The trustee claims that he takes the
same kind of title as a bona fide purchaser for value, but the
rule applicable to this and all similar cases is that the trustee
takes the property of the bankrupt, not as an innocent purchaser, but as the debtor had it at the time of the petition,
subject to all valid claims, liens and equities. Thompson v.
Fairbanks, 196 U. S. 516, and cases cited. And this is so well
settled that our jurisdiction of the writ of error is exceedingly
doubtful. Judge Williams, speaking for Appellate, Division,
Fourth Department, treated of this point thus (113 App. Div.
612, 615):
"Itis said that the bankruptcy of Bacon constituted a bar
to the relief granted in this action. This cannot be true.
The trustee took the bankrupt's. property in the same condition and subject to the same liens as the bankrupt himself
held it. The trustee is in no sense a bona fide purchaser for
value, and entitled to protection as such. No new lien was
created by the decision and judgment appealed from. The
original lien was adjudicated and determined."
Affirmed.
We concur in this view, and the judgment is
