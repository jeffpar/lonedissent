PENDLETON v. UNITED STATES.
Argurncnt for Plaintiff in Error.

PENDLETON, v., TNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

No. 53.

Argued January 21, 1910.-Decided February 21, 1910.

The retention by the prosecuting authorities, without using it on the
trial, of a statement made by the accused, does not amount to compelling him to be a witness against himself within the provisions of
Chap. 5 pf the Philippine Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat.
691..
The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands tries a criminal case on
the record de novo, and if it avoids an error which may have been
committed by the Court of First Iristance, the judgment will not be
reversed by this court on account of such error; and so held in this
case in which the-Court of First Instance took into consideration
the fact that accused did not offer to testify on his own behalf, but
the Supreme Court, on the accused's own appeal, declared that it
did not take that fact into consideiation but rendered its decision
on the proofs.

Mr. Assistant Atlorney General Russell for the United States.
MR.

Ju'ricE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

Plaintiff in error was convicted of the crime of murder in
the Court of First Instance of thQ Province of Cebu, Philippine
Islands, and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, which
was redtccd to seventeen years by the Supreme Court.
The assignments of error are as follows:
1. The accused has been compelled to be a,witness against
himself in violation of Article V of the law of Congress' of
July 1, .1902.
"2. The fact that tlie accused did not offer himself as a
witnessin his own favor has been used to his prejudice in
violation of his right' t6 remain silent ntiI his guilt be esfablished by the'evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.

PENDLETON v. UNITED STATES.
216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"3. The evidence does not show -the guilt of accused of the
crime imputed to him beyond a reasonable doubt."
The argument to support the first assignment of error is not
very tangible, It is based upon an affidavit of defendant in
error that he was subpcenaed as a witness and obeyed by
going to the fiscal's, where he answered questions put to him
without knowing that he had,,a right to refuse or being notifed that he had such right, and not knowing that "the
object of securing his statement was in order to search for
proof against him." The affidavit also states that he was not
represented by counsel, and did not know that he had a right
to consult a lawyer' Motion was made, presumably based on
the affidavit, .for an order to the fiscal to return to the defendant the statement, together with all copies of the same, and
that the fiscal be prohibited from using the statemeift in any
manner whatever. Nothing seems to have been done with
that motion, and'subsequently it was repeated and denied
on the ground. "that it was not a proper time to Make such
motion, as the court could not then decide on the admissibility
of proofs which had not yetbeen offered in the cause." An
exception was entered.
It is not contended that the statement was afterwards used
in any'way, but the action of the 'ourt is urged nevertheless
as an error "so grave and so material," to use counsel's words,
"as to call for a new trial."
The argument to support it is based on suppositions of what
might have been done, and the potency of the statement in
the hands of the prosecuting officer. "It left the defendant
(1)en, it is said, to the fire of a masked battery." But the
law has no measure to apply to such a situatiou. Defendant
was certainly not disabled from telling the truth in olther
statements if he wished to malie then, and to'be able not
to tell the truth can hardly be urged as a legal and constitutional right. The assigmniit ,f error, therefore, i,.- not well
taken,
The second assiginiet of- error is that the fact that the

defendant did not offer himself as a witness was used against
him. To support this contention certain remarks of the judge
of the trial court in delivering sentence upon the defendant
are quoted. The court said:
"The prosecution has presented an abundance of proof
which, in case *the court should give it full credence, would
establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.
On theother hand, the defense has presented very little direct
proof; the accused did not use his right to testify in his own
favor, and no eyewitness has testified favorably to him.
The defense has practically limited itself to Insisting 6n:
'(1) Alleged contradictions between the various witnesses of
the prosecution relating to.the details of identical facts or
happenings related by them. (2) Mistakes which they claim
to be essential, in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution with respect to distances and relative positioils of persons and objects connected with the case. (3) The expert testimony of .two physicians that the deceased could not have
died as the result of a wound received in the manner stated
by the witnesses for the prosecution."
An analysis of this language is made by counsel and its
relation to the general character of the evidence is discussed,
and the conclusion deduced that the trial court urged three
arguments to sustain its judgment: "First, paucity of proof
in behalf of the defendant. Second, his failure to testify in
his own favor. Third, his failure to get any eyewitness to the
shooting, to rebut evidence of the Fililinos who claim to have
been eyewitnesses." And to this summary, which, it is urged,
demonstrates that the trial court considered in deterniiiing
the guilt of defendant, that he failed to take the stand in his
own behalf, tlere is added the comment of the Supreme Court
of the islands in its review of the case, or rather in denying a
motion for a new trial, after its decision of the case. Upon
the first consideration of the case in the .Supreme Court no
assignment of error based on the point was made. It was.
raised foil the first time in what is styled "Exception to the

PENDLETON v.. UNITED STATES.
216 U. S.

Opiri ion of the Court.

judgment, and motion for a new trial," in which he excepted
to the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court and prayed
that it be set aside and a'new trial granted him. The reasons
given were as follows:
"I. The defendant has been compelled to testify against
himself in violation of art. No. 5 of the law of Congress of
July 1, 1902, in the following manner:
"The accused, taking advantage of the right conceded him
in the third. paragraph of article 15 of the General Orders,
No. 58, did not testify ih the Court. of First Instance, and
said court in its judgment considered this circumstance as
prejudicial to the defendant; and the attorney general adduced the same circumstance in his brief in this court in the
following words:
'No direct proof was presented by the defense to contradict the facts istated by the witnesses for the prosecution;
nor did the defendant himself testify in his own favor t6 deny
the grave crime with which lie is charged.'
"And to overcome as far as possible the effect of this illegal
procedure so prejudicial to the accused, his counsel in this
court, speaking in hisname, felt himself obliged to state to
the court that the defendant did not go on the witness stand
because he did not remember anything about the occurrence;
which circumstance .was considered by the court 'as a fact
prejudicial to the defendant and appellant in the following
words:
"'The defendant, a lieutenant of constabulary in command at the Parian Barracks at Cebu, being intoxicated
borrowed a carromata, which was without lights, from a
friend and.was found wandering about the streets therein by
Sanmnicipal policeman. named Almonte, who at, his request,
drove him to the barracks. As :to subsequent occurrences
we have not the benefit of his recollection and must rely oil
the testimony of the witnesses for the. prosecution' and the
circumstances of the case."'!
To which it was replied:

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

216 U. S.

"The court.having heard the petition of Attorney Kincaid,
praying for a new trial of case No. 3176, the United States v.
Pendleton, in which a decision was rendered by this court on
the ninth of the present month of February, 1907, said, that
although the fact that the defendant declined or failed to
testify as a witness was taken into consideration by the Court
of First Instance, this court, in deciding the cause did not
take said fact into consideration, but rendered the decision
in accordance with the proofs presented at the trial, and,
therefore, the new trial solicited is denied."
Defendant puts aside the disclaimer of the Supreme Court
as unimportant in an argument which is certainly difficult
to represent if not to follow. He appealed to the Supreme
Court to review the judgment of the lower court. He made a
motion for a new trial in the Supreme Court, andthat being'
denied, he now urges, not error committed in the Sipreme.
Court, but error committed in the trial court, This is wor ked
out and attempted to be justified by an argument that, it
may be, we do not understand. It is said that the Supreme
Court misapprehended the "function conferred upon,-it by,
Congress and the Philippine Commission in relation to re7.
viewing the decisions of Courts of First Instance." That it
seemed to be of opinion that it had "the same authority in
this. regard as was possessed by its Spanish predecessor,, theau(liencia," and "passed on the decision of the court below
about as a reviewing court would pass on an equity proceeding upon written testimony submitted by. affidavits, and
,interrogatory depositions." And by doing so, counsel further
urge. that the Supreme Court. did not have before it what
they describe as "the supremely human element-the appearance of the witnesses and their manner on the stand, etc.,"
and, not. having such element, could not judge of the effect
of the evidence independently of the silence of the defendant,,
and could not determine therefore how much the.error of the
trial court, in considering such silence, controlled its judgmnent.

The answer is that the Supreme Court had the power

PENMAN v. ST. PAUL INSURANCE CO.

Syllabus.

to review the case and consider all that was necessary to the
exercise of such power. That power was invoked by defendant, and he secured 'from its exercise *a reduction of three
years in his sentence. And Trono v. United States, 199โข U. S.
521, may be cited as an answer to the contention. In that
case the power of review which the Supreme Court possessed
over the judgment of the trial court was exerted to the extent
of reversing a judgment and sentence for assault, and rendering a judgment for homicide. Trono v. United States
needs very little comment. It declares the relation of the
courts and the scheme of procedure existing in the Philippine
Islands and brings the case at bar to the simple proposition,
when stripped of ingenious suggestions, that an error which
was made (if error was made, of which we express no opinion)
at the trial in the court of first instance, and which was not
repeated in the Supreme Court, is not a ground of legal complaint.
The third assignment of error is not discussed by counsel.
It is, however, manifestly without merit.
Judgment affirmed.
