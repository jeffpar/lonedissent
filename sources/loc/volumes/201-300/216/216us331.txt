Argued January 28, 1910.-Decided February 21, 1916.

Where the final judgment of the Supreme Court of a Territory. is not

based on tile power of the legislature to ,enact the statute involved
but ol the construction thereof, this court is not-disposed to disturb
that construction; and so held, following the decisions of the territorial court, that a statute, of'New.Mexico carving a new county
out of an existing one did not create a-vacancy in an office of the
original eount'y.becuse the incumhent did Fiet reside in that portion
of the county which remained.
Qua're whether a judgment of ouster in quo warrardo is conclusive
between the samce parties in a. suit, brought by the de jure relator
against the de fuacto icumbent.

The acts of the legislature of New Mexico of 1903 creating Sandoval County and .the amendatory act were within

prohibiting the passage of special or local bills.

ALI3P, G1T v. SANDOVAL.
216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

These cases involve controversies over the right to the
fees of the office of assessor of Bernalihlo County, New Mexico.
Plaintiff in error received the fees, defendant in error claims
the right to them as the duly-elected officer.
There was prior litigation oveq the right of the oAce.
Proceedings in the nature of quo warranlo were instituted
against plaintiff in error, by the Territory, upon the relation.
of defendant in error,.to try the title of plaintiff in error to
the office. Jtidgment went in favor'of the latter in the trial

court, which was reversed by the Supreme Court, and' the
case remanded for further proceedings. 78 Pac. Rep. 204.
Upon the subsequent proceedings in the trial court judgment was entered, declaring plaintiff in error not entitled to
the office. The judgment also ordered him to deliver to the
relator, defendant in error here, the records and the equipments of the office, "as the lawftil custodian thereof." This
part of the judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court;
the other part, as to the title of plaintiff in error to the office,
was affii'med. 79. Pac. Rep. 719. An appeal was taken to
this court and dismissed because the matter in controversy
was not "measurable.by some sum or value in money." As
to the fees of the office, it was said: "The term of 6ffice had
expired before the rendition of judgment by the territorial
Supreme Court, and as to the effect of the judgment of ouster
in a suit to recover emoluments for the past, that is collateral,
even thmugh tile judgment might be conclusive in such subsequclt action.

145 U. 8. 123; Wa.hiuglon & Gearyeloton R. R. Co. v. District
of Columbia, 146 U. S. 227."
This action was brought for the past fees aid eimlolunients
of the office, amounting, it is alleged, to the sur of six thousand one hundred eighty-four dolla's and sixteen cents
T($6,184.16).
The gr'ounds of action uu'e, as alleged, that Sandoval, d.1e-

fendant in error, was duly elected to the office; that Albright,
plaintiff in error, on the twenty-seventh of March, 1903,
"usurped the same, and excluded the plaintiff therefrom,
and received and appropriated to his own use the fees and
eniolunicnt." of the office until the nineteenth of November,
1904, when the plaintiff (defendant in error here), by a judgment in a "certain proceeding entitled The Territory of New
Mexico on the relation of Jesus Maria Sandoval against the
said George F. Albright, was restored to the possessiop of the
said office." The judgment was made part of the complaint.
A demurrer was filed to the complaint. It was overruled.
An answer was then filed which practicaly admitted the
allegations of the complaint, except the legal right of the
plaintiff to the fees of the office. It admitted that in the
quo warranto proceeding it was adjudged that Albright was
not entitled to the office and had usurped the same, and that
Sandoval was ntitled to it. The answer, however, set up a.
right "to the office in Albright; -that on 'the twenty-third of
March, 1903, he was appointed assessor of the county by the
board of county commissioners of the county,.acting under
and by virtue of § 3 of an act of the legislative assembly of
the Territory, entitled an act to create the county of Sandoval,
approved March 10, 1903, as amended March 12, 1903. That
the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo became vacanit
by reason of such legislation, Sandoval County having previously been a part of Bernalillo. The validity of such legisla.tion was alleged and that the power of appointment was
vested thereby in the board of commissioners cieated by the
.amendatory act-of March 12. It is alleged also that "the
office was subject to the control of the legislature and that a
vacancy thereafter was created by said acts." That Sandoval,
at the time Sandoval County was created, was and had been.
a long time before a resident of Bernalillo, and ceased, therefore, upon the passage of the acts creating Sandoval County,
to be a resident of Bernalillo, and became disqualified from
exercising the duties (if the office of assessor thereof, to which

Opinion of the Court.

he had been elected, and that at the time of the appointment
.of Albright the office was and had been vacant from the. time
of.1the creation of Sandoval County.
The answer admitted the receipt of $6,648 on account of
fees and emoluments, and alleged that Albright paid out the
sum of $2,142.25 for clerical and other expenses necessarily
incurred in administering the office, which amount, he alleged,
he was "entitled to receive as a set off against any demand"
against him. And he alleged that the said sum was paid in
good faith. There was a demurrer to the answer filed and a
replication. The latter accepted the statement of the amount
received by Albright, alleged want of information as to the
amount expended as expenses of the office, and denied that
Albright was an incumbent of the office in good faith.
The demurrer was sustained to all parts of the answer
except those alleging receipt of fes and the payment of
expenses. As to them, evidence was submitted to a jury,.
which, under the direction of the court, returned a verdict
for the plaintiff, Sandoval, in the sum of $5,360.53, which
was the amount sued for less the expenses which had been
incurred by Albright. Both parties moved for a new trial,
the plaintiff on account of the allowance of the expenses, the
defendant on account of the recovery against him of the fees
and emoluments received by him. .Judgment was entered for
the amount of the verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and affirmed
by the Supreme Court. 93 Pac. Rep. 717. Both parties sued
out writs of error. That of A]bright (No. 116) is directed to
the judgment against him; that of Sandoval (No. 117) to
redress the error, which he contends, was made against him
in allowing as a set off against his demalid, the expenses that
Albright had incurred in administering the office.
It is clear that the only questions of fact presented by the

pleadings were as to the amount received and the amount
expended by Albright. This was the view taken of them by
the Supreme Court. That court said: "The right of office
and that the appellee [defendant in error here] was the de jure

216 U. S.

officer were fully determined in the former suits, and cannot
be considered in this, therefore the court below properly
sustained the demurrer to all suich )arts of the answer as
sought to raise this issue." The suits referred to by' the court
were Albright v. Territory, 78 PaI. Rep. 204; Territory v' Albright, 79 Pac. Rep. 719; Albright v. Sandoval, 200 U. S. 9.
The court, therefore, addressed itself to the two propositions which it conceived were left ith the case, the right of
Sandoval to recover the fees received by Albright and the
right of the latter to set off against them his disbursements
for expenses. The court, passing on the first )roposition,
found, it said, no statute of the Territory "governing this
subject," but decided that "the common law, in the absence
of a statute, authorizes a recovery by the ofliecr de jure in
such cases.". On the second proposition it found that there
-could be no question of Albright's good faith, and that it
considered the cases made good faith "the controllingconsideration for the allowances of expenses to an ousted defacto
officer," and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
Plaintiff in error, however, goes back of the decision of the
Supreme Court, and contends that he is not only W%officer
de facto but an officer de jure. In other words, he tisserts
the correctness of the position taken in his answer that by
the legislation creating Sandoval County defendant in error
ceased to be. the assessor of Bernalillo, to which he was duly
elected, that therefore a vacancy existed to which plaintiff
in error was duly appointed.
The basis of this contention is the power of the legislature
to create Sandoval County, and that by the exercise of the
power defendant in error was made a resident of Sandoval
County and became disqualified to be ssssor of Bernalillo.
From this it followed, it is argued, it vacancy occurred to
which )iaintiff in error was iippointed under the act amending the act creating Sandoval County. It certainly follows
that if the residence of defendant in error in Sandoval County
did not create a vacancy there was none to fill, unless, as it is

ALBRIGHT v. SANDOVAL.
216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

contended by defendant in error, that the legislature has the
power to create a vacancy and actually exercised Vhe power.
In Territory v. Albright, 78 Pac. Rep. 204,. the judgment
of the trial court, which dismissed the quo warranto proceed-ings, was reversed, as we -have seen. The Supreme Court
said that. the trial court, in considering the section of the
acts relied on by plaintiff in error, "arrived at the conclusion
that it was the intention. of the legislature to declare that
office [the office of assessor of Bernalillo County] vacant, and
therefore, although those sections did not contain a declaration to that effect, the court was of the opinion that these
sections should be given the effect of such a declaration."
But the Supreme Court added, "we cannot concur with the
trial court in this conclusion," and proceeded to analyze the
legislation, and decided that it -did not have the meaning
plaintiff in error -attributes to it. In other words, did not
create a vacancy in the office of assessor of Bernalillo Coimty.
And considering the laws of the Territory as to the qualification of county officers, decided that residence was not one of
them. The court further decided tha't when plaintiff in error
was appointed the act, under which it iacontended that it
was done, had not taken effect, and that, therefore, his appointment was unauthorized.
The court, considering the legislation in view of the powers
of the legislature as limited by the act of Congress of July 30,
1886 (-24 Stat 170, c. 818), concluded that the legislature had
not the power to *remove and appoint county officers as con-tended, but the decision of the Case was lt on the other
grounds which we have stated. In other words, put u)ou
the construction of the statutes.

And lhat construction we

are not disposed ,to disturb. Fox v. 'Haord/ick, 156 U. S. 674;
English v. Arizona, 214 U. S. 359; Dye v. Crary, 208 U. S.
515.
Under these views it is not necessary to decide wli-ther the
judgment in the quo warranto proceedings is conclusive of
the issues in this case, as contended by defendant in error.

OCTOBERt TEIRM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

216 U. S.

The decision upon the resp6ctive rights of the parties arising
from-the statute of the Territory may be rested on the grounds
which we have expressed, and we come to the proposition
whether Sandoval can recover the fees and emolumeits received by Albright, and whether, if he can, Taay the latter set
off his expenses. The first proposition is not controverted
by. Albright, although. he suggests that there are some wellconsidered cases the other way, and he cites Stuhr v. Curran,
15 Vroom (44,N. J. L.), 181. He also cites Taylor v. Beckham,
178 U. S. 548; Butler v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,. 10
How. 402, for the view that there is no such thing as property
in a )ublic office. However, his ultimate concession is that
the weight of authority is to the effect that a de jure officer
may recover f rom the de facto officer the. emoluments of the
office; less the reasonable expenses incurred in earning such
fees, when the e facto officerentered into the office in good
faith and under color of title. And this was the view of the
Supreme-Court of the Territory. To sustain the first proposition the court reviewed Stuhr v. Curran, supra, and cites
against it United States v. Addison, i Wall. 291; Dolan v.
Mayor of New York, 68 N. Y. 274; Hunter v. Chandler, 45
Missouri, 452; Glascock v. Lyons, 20 Indiana, 1; Douglass v.
State, 31 Indiana, 429; People v.-Miller, 24 Michigan, 458'
Dorsey v. Smyth, 28 California, 21; Nichols v. McLean, 101
N. Y.: 538; Kreitz v. Behrensmeyer, 149 Illinois, 503; Vaux v.
Jefferen, 2 Dyer, 114; Aris v. Stukeley, 2 Mod. 260; Lee v.
Drake, Salk. 467, 468; Webb's Case, 8 Rep. 45; 1 Selw. N. P.
81; 1 Chil. P1. 112. It is not n.cessary to make a review of
these cases. It is enbugh to say that they sustain the proposi-.
ti for which thiey are cited.
The seCoI1'd ,Iuestio,, is moi'e debatable, to wit, whether
Sandoval was etititled to the gross receipts of -the office, as
contended by him, or to the nit receipts as contended by
Albright and as decided by the courts below.
Comsel for Sandoval sees and admits the difficulties which
beset the question, and is not insensible to the justice under

ALBRIGHT v. SANDOVAL.
216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the circumstances of this case of the deductions allowed by
the courts below.
There is Iargument based on the illegality of' Albright's
occupation of the office, and strength in the contention that
a trespasser may not set off the expense he incurred in executing the trespass. It has been held, in a well-considered case,
there can be no deduction for the personal services of the
intruder. People v. Miller, 24 Michigan, 458. It was said in
that case, however, that "There may be reason for deducting
from any official earnings the actual cost of obtaining them
which would have been entailed on any person who might
have held the office." This may be said of the expenses in
controversy in the case at bar. Mayfield v. Moore, 53 Illinois,
428, is the -leading case which sustains the right to deduct
such -expenses. This case is followed by others in the same
court and the same view has been announced by other courts.
We think they express the correct rule. It makes the measure
of recovery the extent of the injury, and the injury, it is clear,
is not the gross earnings. of an office, but such earnings less,
to use, the language of Mr. ChiefJustice Campbell. in People
v. Miller, supra, "the actual cost of obtaining them which
would have been entailed on any person who might have held
the office."
Judgment affirmed.
