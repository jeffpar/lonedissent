SANTA FE CENTRAL RAILWAY COMPANY v.
FRIDAY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
NEW MEXICO.
No. 230. Submitted March 5, 1914.-Decided March 23, 1914.
A statute of a Territory cannot withdraw from the courts established
by the United States authority expressly conferred upon them by
The City of
Congress by the Organic, Act and other statutes.
Panama, 101 U. S. 453.
The District Court of the United States for New Mexico has jurisdiction of a case arising under the Employers' Liability Act of 1906.
This court will not decide against the local understanding as expressed
by the decisions of the Supreme Court of a Territory in construing a
jurisdictional statute affecting a matter of local concern unless those
decisions are clearly wrong. Phwnix Ry. Co. v. Lafidis, 231 U. S. 578.
16 New Mex. 434, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the courts

of a Territory of the United States over actions brought
under the Employers' Liability Act of 1906, are stated in
the opinion.
Mr. E. W. Dobson for plaintiffs in error:
The Organic Act, the acts of Congress and the legislative acts must all be considered and construed in determining the question. See § 10 Organic Act of September 30, 1850; §880, Comp. Laws New Mex. 1897, passed
January 3, 1852; § 1040 Id., passed July 12, 1851; §900
Id., passed September 22, 1846; §901 Id., passed January 26, 1859; §904 Id.; §905 Id., passed January 20, 1859;
§ 2950 Id., passed January 7, 1876; Kearny Code, September 22, 1846, § 18; §§ 1874, 1910, Rev. Stats. U. S., passed
June 14, 1858.
There are, therefore, provisions for District Courts of

the Territory and District Courts for each of the various
counties and a territorial law giving the District Courts in
the counties exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions and fixing the forum where they must be brought or
commenced.
The courts in the various counties having been established by territorial legislation previous to the enactment
of § 1874, Rev. Stat., or which were by law established subsequent to that time, in the counties of the Territory for
the trial of all civil causes, except those in which the United
States was a party, the jurisdiction of the so-called United
States District Courts existing previous to the enactment
of said § 1874, vested in and passed to the District Courts
of the various counties, and out of the so-called United
States courts, except in causes where the United States
is a party. Schofield v. Stephens, 7 New Mex. 619.
Congress did not define the jurisdiction of the District
Courts except as Federal courts, but as courts of the Territory they have such jurisdiction as the territorial legislature might prescribe. The territorial legislature provided
that the District Courts should have original jurisdiction
in all cases, civil and criminal, in which the jurisdiction is
not especially delegated to some other court.
While the Employers' Liability Act was created by
Congress and has now been held to be valid so far as the
Territories are concerned, it is different from the AntiTrust Law, the Meat Inspection Law, the Pure Food Law,
the Interstate Commerce Laws and the Safety Appliance
Law, because under the acts relative to the above subjects the power is given the United States to bring suits
for the purpose of regulating the same, and they would be
considered as arising under the Constitution and laws of
the United States and in which the United States is a
party.
See Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648, for difference
between jurisdiction under § 1868 and § 1910; Clough v.

U. S. 174.
The territorial judicial District Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction sit at one place in the district under a
Federal law and their business is kept separate from the
business transacted in the District Courts held in the
county. Thiede v. Utah Territory, ib; U. S. 570; Simms v.
Simms, 175 U. S. 162; Ferris v. ILigley, 20 Wall. 375;

Court, 7 New Mex. 486.
As to the Employers' Liability Act, approved June 11,
1906, and the act of April 22, 1908, the latter did not give
any life or validity to the act already declared void by the
highest judicial tribunal. Congress did not reenact the
statute, but only provided that this act "shall not affect
any pending action." The act of 1906 was then void and
of no effect.
The act of 1908 was prospective and not retroactive.

applied to the District of Columbia and the Territories
is valid.
Mr. T. B. Catron, with whom Mr. George W. Prichard
was on the brief, for defendant in error:
This suit was brought under the Employers' Liability
Act of Congress approved June 11, 1906, and as a pending
case was prosecuted to a final judgment after the passage
of the act of Congress approved April 22, 1908.

SANTA FE RY. CO. v. FRIDAY.
232 U. S.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

Suit was brought in the First Judicial District Court,
or in other words, in the territorial or Federal court as
distinguished from the County District Court, because the
act under which it was brought was a Federal act.
That court was the proper court in which to bring the
suit under § 1910, Rev. Stat., and other United States
statutes and decisions thereunder.
In the District or Federal Courts of the Territories is
vested the same jurisdiction as is vested in the Circuit
and District Courts of the United States "in all cases
arising under the Constitution and laws of the United
States." Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 154; Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet, 511; Benners v. Porter, 9 How.
235; Clinton v. Englebucht, 13 Wall. 434; N. P. R. R. Co. v.

186; Clough v. Curtis, 131 U. S. 361; McAllister v. United
States, 141 U. S. 174.
For cases upholding the jurisdiction of the Federal, or
Judicial District Courts of the Territories, to try causes
arising under the laws of the United States where the
United States is not a party, both before and since the
passage of § 1874, Rev. Stat., see American Ins. Co. v.
Canter, 1 Pet. 511; Benner v. Porter, 9 How. 265; City of
Panama v. Phelps, 101 U. S. 453.
For instances in which such jurisdiction has been exercised by the territorial District Courts under such acts,
see The Cutler v. The Columbia, 1 Oregon, 101; Price v.
Frankel, 1 Wash. Terr. 43; Meigs v. The Northerner, 1
Wash. Terr. 91; Griwn v. Nichols, 1 Wash. Terr. 375.

or both are corporations, or whether the United States is
a party, the rule is the same so long as the suit arises under
an act of Congress.
Sections 880, 900, 901, 905, 1040 and 2950, Compiled
Laws of 1897 of this Territory have no application to the
case at bar. The territorial legislature has n: power to
restrain or control the Judicial District CourL or Federal
court in the exercise of their power and jurisdiction in any
case arising under the laws of the United States. United
States v. Jones, 5 Utah, 553.
Schofield v. Stephens, 7 New Mex. 819, distinguished,
and see Thornton on Employers' Liability, p. 132.
The proceedings in the trial court were regular and the
final judgment thereunder is valid. Winfree v. Nor. Pac.
Ry. Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 698, distinguished, and .see El Paso
&c. Ry. Co. v. Gutierrez, 215 U. S. 87.
No inchoate rights arising under the act of 1906 in the
Territory of New Mexico have been destroyed by any
subsequent legislation.
MR. JUsTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action for personal injuries brought by the
defendant in error against the Railway Company under
the act of June 11, 1906, c. 3073, 34 Stat. 232, held valid
for the Territories in El Paso & Northeastern Ry. Co. v.
Gutierrez, 215 U. S. 87. The plaintiff got a verdict and
judgment which the Supreme Court of the Territory affirmed. 16 New Mex. 434.
The only argument addressed to us is an attack upon
the jurisdiction of the court that tried the case. That
court was the District Court sitting for the trial of causes
arising under the .Constitution and laws of the United
States in the First Judicial District in the Territory of
New Mexico. The Organic Act of September 9, 1850,
c. 49, 9 Stat. 446, provided in § 10 for three judicial districts, and for a District Court to be held in each by a Jus-

SANTA FE RY. CO. v. FRIDAY.

Opinion of the Court.

tice of the Supreme Court as should be prescribed by law.
It further enacted that the jurisdiction of the several
courts therein provided for "shall be as limited by law";
that "each of the said District Courts shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction in all cases arising under the
Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested
in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States;"
and that the first six days of every term or so much of
them as necessary "shall be appropriated to the trial of
causes arising under the said Constitution and laws."
See also Rev. Stat., § 1910. The court where the trial was
held was one of these District Courts provided for by the
Organic Act and the case was one arising under the laws
of tht United States.
But it is said that the jurisdiction of these courts was
to be 'as limited by law,' that that means by territorial
legislation, and that a territorial statute provided for the
holding of District Courts in the counties, and enacted
that the District Courts in the counties should have "exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases which shall
not be cognizable before probate judges and justices of
the peace." Compiled Laws, 1897, § 900. By a later
territorial act the District Courts in 'the various counties
were given 'jurisdiction in all civil causes in said counties
which according to law belong to the District Courts,' id.,
§ 901. And this was in pursuance not only of the Organic
Act but of another act of Congress of June 14, 1858, c. 166,
11 Stat. 366, afterwards Rev. Stat., § 1874, by which the
judges of the Supreme Court were" authorized to hold court
within their respective districts, in the counties wherein, by
the laws of the Territory, courts have been or may be established, for the purpose of hearing and determining all
matters and causes, except those in which the United
States is a party." Thus, it is argued, exclusive jurisdiction of cases like the present was transferred to the County
District Courts.

But it has been held for many years that the purpose
and effect of these statutes was to give the judges of the
Supreme Court sitting in the County District Courts authority to hear cases arising under territorial laws, and to
make the jurisdiction over such cases exclusive in those
courts. Lincoln-Lucky & Lee Mining Co. v. District Court,
7 New Mex. 486, 499-501. Murphy v. Murphy, 25 N. W.
Rep. 806. The statutes, we believe, have not been understood to attempt to withdraw from the courts of the larger
districts the authority expressly conferred upon them by
'the Revised Statutes and the Organic Act, a thing that of
course territorial statutes could not do. See The City of
Panama,101 U. S. 453. We should not decide against the
local understanding of a matter of purely local concern
unless we thought it clearly wrong, instead of thinking it,
as we do, plainly right. Phonix Ry. Co. v. Landis, 231

No. I%

Argued January 16, 19, 1914.-Decided March 23, 1914.

The validity of a local option law adopted after amendments is not
affected by the fact that the amendments are subsequently declared
to be unconstitutional.
Unconstitutional amendments to a constitutional statute are mere
nullities.
Whether the adoption by a district of a local option statute is affected
by the subsequent determination by the courts that certain features
of the act were unconstitutional, is not a Federal question and is for
the state court to determine.
On writ of error under § 237, Judicial Code, this court cannot inquire
