MIEDREICH v. LAUENSTEIN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 20.

Argued October 31, 1913.-Decided February 2, 1914.

Although the record is meager of attempts to raise it, if.the state court
holds that a Federal question is made before it, according t its
practice, and proceeds to determine it, this court regards the question as duly made.
It is only in exceptional cases, where what purports to be a finding of
fact is not strictly such but is so involved with, and dependent upon,
questions of law, that this court departs from the rule that it accepts

as binding the findings of fact made by the highest court of the
State from which the case comes.
This court has always recognized the difficulty of satisfactorily defining
the term "due process of law" in general terms applicable to all
cases, and the desirability of judicial determination in each case as
the question arises. Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97.
Law, in its regular course of administration through courts of justice, is
due process, and, when secured by the law of the State, the constitutional requirement is satisfied. Leeper v. Texas, 139 U. S. 462.
In the absence of fraud or collusion, where the original party did all
that the law required in the issue and attempt to serve process, but
the sheriff made a false return to the effect that service had been
made, the state court, in the absence of direct attack upon the return,
in acting thereon as though it were true, and holding that the sole
remedy was an action against the sheriff for a false return, did not
deny the party due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.
One damaged by reason of a false return of the sheriff as to service of
process, and who is given a remedy against the sheriff, is not denied
due process of law by the enforcement of the judgment based on such
false return because the amount of the sheriff's bond is less than the
amount of his loss.
172 Indiana, 140, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of a judgment based on a false return of service made by a sheriff,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. George K. Denton for plaintiff in error, submitted:
Each of the six assignments of error state a Federal

Due process of law implies a tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, and a sufficient setvice on the defendant, or
an appearance on his part, to render him amenable to that
jurisdiction. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714.
An opportunity to be heard is essential to due process of

In its restricted sense, jurisdiction means the power to
decide. Without this any judgment is subject to direct or

MR. JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error, by complaint filed in the Superior
Court of Vanderburgh County, State of Indiana, sought
to vacate a judgment of foreclosure rendered by that
court in a prior case and to be permitted to redeem the
property therein involved and prays for other relief, and,
judgment having been entered in favor of the defendant
in error, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of
Indiana (172 Indiana, 140), this writ of error was sued out.
The facts, so far as pertinent to our review, are: The
complaint, in the fourth paragraph, alleged that the plaintiff in error was the owner of certain property, subject to a
mortgage foreclosed in a former suit; that she was a
minor when the foreclosure proceedings were had; that
she was not a resident of Vanderburgh County, where the
action was brought, but -was and had been for many years

232 U. S.

a resident of Gibson County, and that she was not summoned in such action, had no knowledge of its pendency,

and did not waive service or enter her appearance therein.
It was further alleged that the plaintiff in error was not
amenable to the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Vanderburgh
County, but that, although she was not served with process, he made a false return of a pretended summons, by
which the court was wrongfully imposed upon, and, being
so advised, at the instance of attorneys for the predecessor
of defendant in error, the court appointed a guardian
ad litem for her, who answered in the suit, and that a
decree was rendered, her property sold and bid in by the
predecessor of the defendant in error. The demurrer of the
defendant in error to this paragraph thus construed. was
sustained by the lower court and its decision affirmed by
the Supreme Court. Other paragraphs of the complaint
alleged fraud on the part of the predecessor of the defendant in error and her attorneys. The lower court found
against this charge, and the Supreme Court, after stating
'that there was legal evidence to support the finding, re,
fused to disturb it.
The record is meager of attempts to raise a Federal
question by reason of alleged violations of rights secured
by the Constitution of the United States, aptly set forth
and referred to in some proper way, and it is contended
by the defendant in error that the writ should be dismissed
for that reason. We find in the opinion of the Supreme
Court of Indiana a statement that "both parties have
treated this suit as one arising under the provisions of
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
and as presenting the question of due process of law and
rights guaranteed by article I, §21, of the state constitution," and the court, after making this statement,
takes up the various grounds of attack upon the original
decree for alleged fraudulent service or want of service
upon the minor defendant in the foreclosure proceedings

MIEDREICH v. LAUENSTEIN.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and disposes of them against the contention of the plaintiff in error. There is no repudiation of the position of
both parties that questions were raised under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
and we think the court may be fairly taken to have regarded such questions as duly before it for consideration.
Where a state court holds that a Federal question is made
before it, according to its practice, and proceeds to determine it, this court will regard the question as duly
made. San Jose Land & Water Co. v. San Jose Ranch Co.,
189 U. S. 177, 179-180; Haire v. Rice, 204 U. S. 291, 299;
Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., 207 U. S. 142,
148; Atchison, Topeka & Sante F6 Ry. v. Sowers, 213 U. S.
55, 62.
In the opinion of the Supreme Court upon rehearing the
charge that the service of process was fraudulently procured by the predecessor in title of the defendant in error
or her attorneys was held to be foreclosed by the findings
of the court below, and the Supreme Court held that the
findings were supported by testimony in the record showing competent evidence to that end. It is urged that upon
this writ of error this court should reexamine the conclusions of fact just referred to and the rulings of the Supreme
Court of Indiana in respect thereto. This court has repeatedly held that in cases coming to it from the Supreme
Court of a State it accepts as binding the findings upon
issues of fact duly made in that court. Waters-Pierce Oil
Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S. 86, 107; Rankin v. Emigh, 218 U. S.
27, 34; Kerfoot v. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank, 218 U. S.
281, 288. That principle is applicable here. The case
does not come within the exceptional class of cases where
what purports to be a finding of fact is not strictly such
but is so involved with and dependent upon questions of
law bearing upon the alleged Federal right as to be a
decision of those questions rather than of a pure question
of fact, or where there is that entire lack of evidence to

support the conclusion upon the Federal question that
gives this court the right of review. Kansas City Southern
Ry. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., 223 U. S. 573, 591;
Creswill v. Knights of Pythias, 225 U. S. 246, 261; Southern
Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, 227 U. S.601, 611; Portland Ry.
Co. v. Oregon R. R. Com'n, 229 U. S. 397, 411-412.
The Supreme Court of Indiana stated the question upon
the decision of which the Federal question of due process
arises as follows:
"The question is then presented whether the allegations,
that appellant was a minor, was not a resident of Vanderburgh county, was a resident of Gibson county, and had
been for many years, that no summons was served on
her, that she had no knowledge of the proceedings, did
not waive service, nor did any one for her or in her behalf
or with her consent, enter appearance for her, that she
was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the sheriff of
Vanderburgh county, that, notwithstanding that she was
not served with process, the sheriff of Vanderburgh county
made a false return of a summons, and the court was
wrongfully imposed upon by such false return, and, being
thus falsely advised at the instance of appellant's attorneys,
[i. e., the attorneys for the predecessor of the defendant in
error] appointed a guardian ad litem. for her-constitute
a charge of fraud. The return was regular on its face.
The court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and
apparently jurisdiction of the person of appellant. The
false return was not procured by the fraud, collusion or
imposition of the plaintiff or his [her] attorneys [in the
foreclosure suit]. It is not alleged that either knew of the
fact that there had been no service on appellant. The
allegations practically present this question. If, without
any fraud, or any act on the part of a party to an action
or his attorney, a return is made by a sheriff showing
service, regular on its face, without knowledge of the
party that there was in fact no service, and no act is done

MIEDREICH v. LAUENSTEIN.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

or thing said to mislead the sheriff, is it an imposition or
fraud upon the court to present such summons and return
and obtain a judgment upon it, and is it a charge of fraud
or imposition upon the court to allege that the court was
wrongfully imposed upon by such false return, and was
thus falsely advised? The whole allegations must be
taken together, and the scope and theory of the paragraph,
as we construe it, is that the court was misled by a false
return of the sheriff. The court had a right to rely and
act upon the return. It imports verity to the court.
The sheriff assumes the responsibility, in taking the office,
of seeing to it that he does make the right service. Nichols
v. Nichols (1884), 96 Indiana, 433; State, ex rel., v. Leach
(1858), 10 Indiana, 308; State, ex rel., v. Lines (1853),
4 Indiana, 351.
"If this were not true, no litigant could ever know when
his rights were adjudicated and set at rest, and, to the
end that the party may be made whole, an action for a
false return will lie. Splahn v. Gillespie (1874), 48 Indiana,
397; Rowell v. Klein (1873), 44 Indiana, 290.
"If it be said that the amount of bond a sheriff is required to give might not cover the damage in any or every
case, it is sufficient to say that that is a legislative matter,
and not a judicial one."
The question then is, does the ruling predicated upon
the principles thus stated, made in the state court wherein
the party has been duly heard, amount to a denial of
due process of law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution?
This court has recognized the difficulty of satisfactorily
defining in general terms which shall apply to all cases
what is meant by the term "due process of law," and the
desirability of judicial determination upon each case as
the question arises. Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97.
If the exercise of judicial power be such "as the settled
maxims of law permit and sanction, and under such

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

232 U. S.

safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those
maxims prescribe for the class of cases to which the one in
question belongs," there has been no deprivation of due
process of law. Cooley on Constitutional Limitations (7th
ed.), 506; Leigh v. Green, 193 U. S. 79, 87. And this court,
speaking by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, in Leeper v. Texas,
139 U. S. 462, 468, said: "Law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process,
and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional
requirement is satisfied." This language was quoted with
approval in Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Iowa, 160 U. S. 389,
393.
In the present case the State has madc provision for
the service of process, and the original party in the foreclosure proceeding did all that the law required.in the issue
of and attempt to serve process; and, without fraud or
collusion, the sheriff made a return to the court that service had been duly made. The duty of making such
service and return by the law of the State is delegated to
the sheriff, and, although contrary to the fact, in the
absence of any attack upon it, the court was justified
in acting upon such return as upon a true return. If the
return is false the law of the State, as set forth by its
Supreme Court, permitted a recovery against the sheriff
upon his bond. We are of the opinion that this system of
jurisprudence, with its provisions for safeguarding the
rights of litigants, is due process of law. It may result,
unfortunately, as is said to be the fact in this case, that the
recovery upon the sheriff's bond will not be an adequate
remedy, but statutes must be framed and laws administered
so as to protect as far as may be all litigants and other
persons who derive rights from the judgments of courts.
So far as this record discloses the purchaser at the sheriff's
sale had a right to rely upon the record, which imported
verity as to the nature of the service upon the plaintiff
in error. If this were not true, as the Supreme Court of

MIEDREICH v. LAUENSTEIN.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Indiana points out, there would be no protection to
parties who have relied upon judicial proceedings importing verity, upon the faith of which rights have been
adjudicated and value parted with. In a case of this
character the law must have in view, not only the rights
of the defendant who has been a victim of a false return
on the part of the sheriff, but of persons who have relied
upon the regularity of the return of officials necessarily
trusted by law. with the responsibility of advising the
court as to the performance of such duties as are here involved. Were the law otherwise titles might be attacked
many years after they were acquired, where the party
had been guilty of no fraud and had acted upon the faith
of judicial proceedings apparently perfect in every respect.
This has been the rule of law applied, to a similar situation in the courts of other States. Gregory v. Ford, 14
California, 138; Stites v. Knapp, Ga. Dec. 36, pt. 2;
Taylor v. Lewis, 25 Kentucky, 400; Gardner v. Jenkins,
14 Maryland, 58; Smoot v. Judd, 184 Missouri, 508;
Johnson v. Jones, 2 Nebraska, 126; Wardsboro v. Whitingham, 45 Vermont, 450; Preston v. Kindrick, 94 Virginia,
760. And see in this connection Walker v. Robbins, 14
How. 584, 585; Knox County v. Harshman, 133 U. S. 152,
156.
Without the necessity of deciding more in the present
case, it is enough to say that the decision of the Supreme
Court of Indiana, made under the circumstances detailed,
did not in our opinion deprive the plaintiff in error of
due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Indiana should be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
