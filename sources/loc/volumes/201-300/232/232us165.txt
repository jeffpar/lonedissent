that Burbank left the State with the intention of returning; but that does not import a failure to recognize, as the
court clearly did recognize, that he might change his
mind. Reliance also is placed upon the head note of the
decision, which states that the intent to leave only temporarily is conclusively presumed to continue until the
notarial procuration is recalled, and that the executors are
concluded from asserting a change of domicile. But the
head note is given no special force by statute or rule of
court, as in some States. It inaccurately represents the
reasoning of the judgment. In 129 Louisiana it is said
to have been made by the court. However that may be,
we look to the opinion for the original and authentic statement of the grounds of decision. It may be that in fact
the conduct of the testator in Louisiana was given greater
weight, because of the statutes of the State, than others
might give it, but no error of law appears that would warrant a reversal of the judgment below. German Savings &
Loan Society v. Dormitzer, 192 U. S. 125, 128.

CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE & ST. PAUL RAILWAY
COMPANY v. POLT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF SOUTH
DAKOTA.

No. 161.

Argued January 16, 1914.-Decided January 26, 1914.

While the States have a large latitude in the policy they will pursue in
regard to enforcing prompt settlement of claims against railroad
companies, the rudiments of fair play to the companies as required
by the Fourteenth Amendment must be recognized.

liable for double damages in case of failure to pay a claim or to offer

a sum equal to what the jury finds the claimant entitled to, held to
be unconstitutional as depriving the companies of their property
without due process of law. St. Louis, Iron Mtn. & Southern Ry. v.
Wynne, 224 U. S. 354, followed; Yazoo & Miss. Valley R. R. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., 226 U. S. 217, distinguished.
26 So. Dak. 378, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the validity under the due
process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of a
judgment for double damages entered under a railroad
claim statute of South Dakota, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William G. Porter,with.whom Mr. Burton Hanson,
Mr. Ed. L. Grantham and Mr. Harrison C. Preston were
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Chapter 215, Session Laws of South Dakota for 1907,
is unconstitutional in that it imposes a penalty for delinquency in payment of a debt.
The act discriminates against one class of litigants in
favor of another, denying to plaintiff in error equal protection of the laws.
The law in its operation is pernicious and works a rank
injustice.

MR. JusTCE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit against the plaintiff in error for loss of
property destroyed by fire communicated from its locomotive engine. A statute of South Dakota, after making
the Railroad Company absolutely responsible in such
cases, goes on to make it liable for double the amount of
damage actually sustained unless it pays the full amount
.within sixty days from notice. If, within sixty days, it
shall "offer in writing to pay a fixed sum, being the full
amount of the damages sustained and the owner shall refuse to accept the same, then in any action thereafter
brought for such damages when such owner recovers a
less sum as damages than the amount so offered, then such
owner shall recover only his damages, and the railway
company shall recover its costs." South Dakota Laws,
1907, c. 215. The plaintiff got a verdict for $780. The
Railroad had offered $500; less, that is, than the amount
of the verdict, -while the plaintiff on the other hand demanded more. In his demand, his declaration and his
testimony he set the damage at $838.20. A judgment for
double damages was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
State. 26 So. Dak. 378.
The defendant in error presented no argument, probably because-he realized that under the recent decisions

of this court the judgment could not be sustained. No
doubt the States have a large latitude in the policy that
they will pursue and enforce, but the rudiments of fair
play required by the Fourteenth Amendment are wanting
when a defendant is required to guess rightly what a jury
will find, or pay double if that body sees fit to add one
cent to the amount that was tendered, although the tender
was obviously futile because of an excessive demand. The
case is covered by St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern
Ry. Co. v. Wynne, 224 U. S. 354. It is not like those in
which a moderate penalty is imposed for failure to satisfy
a demand found to be just. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley

Judgment reversed.

STATE OF ALABAMA v. SCHMIDT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA.

No. 595.

Argued January 12, 1914.-Decided January 26, 1914.

The act of March 2, 1819, c. 47, ยง 6, 3 Stat. 489, under which Alabama
became a State, vestedthe legal title of section 16 of every township
in the State absolutely although the statute declared that it was for
the use of schools.
While the trust created by a compact between the States and the
United States that section 16 be used for school purposes is a sacred
obligation imposed on the good faith of the State, the obligation is
honorary and the power of the State where legal title has been vested
in it is plenary and exclusive. Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173.
Statutes of limitation providing for title by adverse possession against
the State after a specified period are a valid exercise of the power of
the State and apply to lands conveyed to the State absolutely by
the United States although for the use of schools. Nor. Pac. Railway
Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, distinguished.
