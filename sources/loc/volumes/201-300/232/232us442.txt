boats instead of vehicles. "The way sought to be established," said the Supreme Court of Minnesota, p. 465,
"a canal or waterway, with walks along each side" was
"clearly a public way, subject to the rules governing public ways." It cannot make a difference in the constitutional rights of the Railway Company that this way was
not constructed entirely, or chiefly, of solid earth; it is
the fact, and not the mode, of public passage that is controlling. The case must be regarded as being one of a
public crossing provided by law; and the authorities we
have cited lead to the conclusion that the State, without
infringing the guaranties of the Federal Constitution, could
require the Railway, Company to make suitable provision
for carrying its tracks over the crossing without compensation.
The judgment is affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. PELICAN.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 787.

Argued January 13, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.

The-.Colville Reservation in the State of Washington was set apart by
Executive order in July, 1872, has boen repeatedly recognized by
acts of Congress and is a legally constituted reservation, and, as
such, is included in Indian country to which § 2145, Rev. Stat.,
refers.
A legally constituted Indian reservation is none the less embraced
within the Indian country referred to in § 2145, Rev. Stat., because
it may have been segregated from the public domain.
The authority of Congress to deal with crimes committed on or against
Indians upon the lands within an Indian Reservation is not affected

by the admission of the Territory, within which it is included, as a
State into the Union.
Lands allotted in severalty to the Indians on the Colville Reservation
under the acts of July 1, 1892, and July 1, 1898, when the rest of the
reservation was thrown open to settlement were held in trust by the
United States for the allottees under the jurisdiction and control of
Congress for all governmental purposes relating to the guardianship
and protection of the Indians.
Congress has power to punish crimes committed by or against Indians
upon allotted lands, and the allotments in severalty are embraced in
the term ,Indian country as used in § 2145, Rev. Stat., and the
allotments of the Colville Reservation have not been excluded therefrom by the statutes providing for the allotments.
Territorial jurisdiction of the United States does not depend upon the
size of the particular areas held for Federal purposes. Criminal
Code, § 272.
The retention by the United States of jurisdiction over Indian allotments is based on the fundamental consideration of the protection
of a dependent people. United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432.
Part of the National policy in regard to Indians is that the United
States shall retain control over the allotments in severalty for the
statutory period during which the Indians are to be maintained.as
well as prepared for assuming habits of civilized life and ultimately
the privileges of citizenship.
Congress has power under the Constitution to continue the guardianship of the Government over Indians for the period specified in the
statutes for keeping the title of the allotments in the United States.
Even if one committing a crime on an Indian allotment is not an
Indian, if the crime was committed against an allottee Indian within
the trust period, it is punishable under the laws of the United States
and the Federal court has jurisdiction.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the United States over crimes committed within
Indian country, are stated in the opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUsTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the

court.
The defendants were indicted for the murder, on August 30, 1913, of Ed Louie, a full-blood Indian and a member of the Colville tribe. It was charged that the crime was
committed "at a point about nine miles northwest of the
town of Curlew, in the county of Ferry, State bf Washington, in the Indian country, to wit, upon the allotment of
one Agnes, an Indian, being lot three of section twentysix, and lot nine of section thirty-five, in township forty
north, of range thirty-two, E. W. M., in the Northern
Division of the Eastern District of Washington, said land
being then held-in trust by the United States for the said
Agnes for the period of twenty-five years'frbm the date
of the trust patent to wit, from the 6th day of December,
A. D., 1909."
The indictment was based upon § 2145 of the Revised
Statutes which provides that, save as stated, "the general
laws of the United States as to the punishment of crimes
committed in any place within the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of
Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country" (see Rev.
Stat., § 5339; Criminal Code, 35 Stat. 1088, c. 321, §§ 272,
273, 341).
A demurrer was filed upon the ground that it did not
appear that the crime had been committed within "the
Indian country" and hence that the court was without
jurisdiction. In connection with the hearing upon the
demurrer the parties stipulated that the land described
in the indictment as the place of the crime had been
allotted to the Indian Agnes under the a t approved
February 8, 1887, and the act in amendment and extension
thereof approved February 28, 1891, and that this land
was situated on that part of the Colville Indian Reservation which had been opened to settlement and entry by

Opinion of the Court.

the act of Congress. (See act of July 1, 1892, c. 140, 27
Stat. 62.) The District Court, holding that the Agnes
allotment was not a part of the Indian country within the
meaning of the statute, sustained the demurrer; and the
Government brings this writ of error under the Criminal
Appeals Act, March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
There can be no doubt that the Colville Reservation,
set apart by executive order on July 2, 1872 (Exec. Ord.
Ind. Reserv. (ed. 1912), 194, 195; 1 Kappler, 915, 916)
and repeatedly recognized by acts of Congress, 1 was a
legally contituted reservation., In re Wilson, 140 U. S.
575, 577. As such it was included in the "Indian country"
to which § 2145 of the Revised Statutes refers, and it
was none the less embraced within that description because it had been segregated from the public domain.
Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S. 243, 269. The inquiry,
then, is whether, with respect to the part of the original
reservation that is comprised in the described allotment,
the United States has lost the jurisdiction which it formerly had. The authority of Congress to deal with crimes
committed by or against Indians upon the lands within
the reservation was not affected by the admission of the
State of Washington into the Union (act of February 22,
1889, c. 180, 25 Stat. 676, 677; Draperv. United States, 164
U. S. 240, 242, 247; Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S.
243, 271, 272); and we pass to the consideration of the
effect of the Federal legislation by which the reservation
was diminished.
By the act of July 1, 1892, c. 140, 27 Stat. 62, a specifiedl
tract or portion -of the reservation-with certain exceptions-was "vacated and restored to the public domain"
July 4, 1884, e. 180, 23 Stat. 76, 79; February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24
Stat. 388; February 28, 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794; July 1, 1892, c. 140,

and it was provided that this tract should be open to
settlement and entry by the proclamation ofthe President
and should be disposed of under the general laws applicable to the disposition of public lands in the State of
Washingfon. The exceptions were made by Congress in
order to care for the Indians residing on that portion of
the reservation. Every such Indian was entitled to select
therefrom eighty acres which wa to be alloted to the
Indian in severalty (§ 4). The titles to the lands selected
were to "be held in trust for the benefit of the allottees,
respectively, and afterwards conveyed in fee simple to
the allottees or their heirs" as provided in the acts of
February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, and February 28,
1891, c. 38, 26 Stat. 794. Further, certain school and mill
lands within the described tract were reserved from the
operation of the statute, unless other lands were selected
in their stead (§6).
The evident purpose of Congress was to carve out of the
portion of the reservation restored to the public domain
the lands to be allotted and reserved, as stated, and to
make the restoration effective only as to the residue. The
vacation and restoration which the statute accomplished
(§ 1) was thus expressly made "subject to the reservations
and allotment of lands in severalty to the individual
members of the Indians of the Colville Reservation" for
which the act provided. In 1898, in furtherance of the
same object, Congress required the completion of the
allotments as soon as practicable and not later than six
months after the President's proclamation (act of July 1,
1898, c. 545, 30 Stat. 571, 593). Accordingly, the President issued his proclamation on April 10, 1900, declaring
that the restored portion of the reservation would be
open to settlement and entry on October 10, 1900, and
an appropriate clause was inserted which saved and excepted such tracts as had been or might be "allotted to
or reserved or selected for the Indians, or other purposes,"

under the governing statutes. 31 Stat. 1963, 1965. The
Government presents extracts from the records of the
Department of the Interior which purport to show that
the actual allotment to the Indian Agnes, of the land described in the indictment, had been made prior to the date
of this proclamation, and we are asked to take notice of
that fact. We find it to be unnecessary to pass upon this,
but we shall assume in view of the grounds of the decision
below that the allotment was duly made under the statutory provisions to which we have referred, and it follows
that these allotted lands must be deemed to be among
those excepted from the portion of the reservation which
was thrown open to settlement.
Although the lands were allotted in severalty, they were
to be held in trust by the United States for twenty-five
years for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or his
heirs, and during this period were to be inalienable. That
the lands, being so held, continued to be under the jurisdiction and control of Congress for all governmental purposes, relating to the guardianship and protection of the Indians, is not open to controversy. United States v. Rickert,
188 U. S. 432, 437; McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 466,
468; Couture v. United States, 207 U. S. 581; United States
v. Celestine, 215 U. S. 278, 290, 291; United States v. Sutton,
215 U. S. 291; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S.
286, 315, 316; Hallowell v. United States, 221 U. S. 317;
United States v. Wright, 229 U. S. -226, 237. Thus, in
the act of January 30, 1897, c. 109, 29 Stat. 506, relating to
the introduction of intoxicating liquor "into the Indian
country," it is expressly provided that this term "shall
include any Indian allotment while the title to the same
shall be held in trust by the Government, or while the
same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the
consent of the United States." This statute was upheld
in United States v. Sutton, supra, as a valid exercise of
Federal power with respect to allotments made under the

act of February 8, 1887, within the Yakima Reservation
in the State of Washington. Again, in Hallowell v. United
States, supra, the Federal jurisdiction under the same
statute was sustained with respect to an allotment to an
Omaha Indian in Nebraska, the title being held in trust by
the Government under the act of August 7, 1882, c. 434,
22 Stat. 341. There, it appeared that practically all the
lands in the Omaha Reservation .had been allotted and
that many of the allotments of deceased Indians had
passed into the hands of the whites, without restrictions,
under the provisions of the act of May 27, 1902, c. 888, 32
Stat. 245, 275. Further, the Omaha Indians were exercising the rights of citizenship within the State and the
defendant himself, who was charged with taking liquor
to his own allotment, was a citizen and had served as a
public officer. The question certified to this court was,
in effect, whether the fact that the allotment was held by
the Government in trust authorized Congress to regulate
or prohibit the introduction of liquor. This question was
answered in the affirmative, the court saying (221 U. S.
p. 324): "In the case at bar, the United States had not
parted with the title to the lands, but still held them in
trust for the Indians. In that situation its power to make
rules and 'regulations respecting such territory was
ample.

.

.

.

While for many purposes the jurisdic-

tion of the State of Nebraska had attached, and the
Indian as a citizen was entitled to the rights, privileges,
and immunities of citizenship, still the United States
within its own territory and in the interest of the Indians,
had jurisdiction to pass laws protecting such Indians from
the evil results of intoxicating liquors as was done in the
act of January 30, 1897, which made it an offense to introduce intoxicating liquors into such Indian country,
including an Indian allotment." It cannot be doubted
that the power of Congress was quite as complete to
punish crimes committed by or against Indians: upon

allotted lands of this character as to prohibit the introduction of liquor. The present question then is not one of
power, but whether it can be said that the descriptive
term "Indian country" as it is used in § 2145 of the Revised Statutes is inadequate to embrace these allotments,
or, if it is adequate for that purpose, whether Congress
in providing for the allotments has excluded them from
the purview of that statute.
We find no inadequacy in the statutory description.
The lands, which prior to the allotment undoubtedly
formed part of the Indian country, still retain during the
trust period a distinctively Indian character, being devoted to Indian occupancy under the limitations imposed
by F~deral legislation. The explicit provision in the act
of 1897, as to allotments, we do not regard as pointing a
distinction but- rather as emphasizing the intent of Congress in carrying out its policy with respect to allotments
in severalty where these have been accompanied with
restrictioxs upon alienation or provision for trusteeship
on the part of the Government. In the present case,
the original reservation was Indian country simply because
it had been validly set apart for the use of the Indians as
such, under the superintendence of the Government.
Donnelly v. United States, supra. The same considerations,
in substance, apply to the allotted lands which, when the
reservation was diminished, were excepted from the
portion restored to the public domain. The allottees werepermitted to enjoy a more securE: tenure and provision was
made for their ultimatE ownership without restrictions.
But, meanwhile, the lands remained Indian lands set
apart for Indians under governmental care; and we are
unable to find ground for the conclusion that they became
other than Indian country through the distribution into
separate holdings, the Government retaining control.
It is said that it is not to be supposed that Congress has
intended to maintain the Federal jurisdiction over hunVOL. ccxxxi-29

dreds of allotments scattered through territory other
portions of which were open to white settlement. But
Congress expressly so provided with respect to offenses
committed in violation of the act of 1897. Nor does the
territorial jurisdiction of the United States depend upon
the size of the particular areas which are held for Federal
purposes (Criminal Code, § 272). It must be remembered
that the fundamental consideration is the protection of a
dependent "eople. As the court said in United States v.
Rickert, 188 U. S. 432, 437, where allotments had been
made under the conditions provided by the act of February 8, 1887 (and it was found that the agreement with
the Indians, 26 Stat. 1035-1038, did not indicate any
different relation of the United States to the allotted
lands from that created or recognized by that act):
"These Indians are yet wards of the Nation, in a condition of pupilage or dependency, and have not been discharged from that condition. They occupy these lands
with the consent and authority of the United States; and
the holding of them by the United States under the act of
1887, and the agreement of 1889, ratified by the act of
1891, is part of the national policy by which the Indians
are to be maintained as well as prepared for assuming the
habits of civilized life, and ultimately the privileges of
citizenship." It is true that by section six of the act of
1887, 24 Stat. p. 390, it was provided that upon the completion of the allotments and the patenting of the lands to
the allottees under that act every allottee should "have
the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and
criminal, of the State or Territory" in which he resided.
See Matter of Heff, 197 U. S. 488. But, by the act of
May 8, 1906, c. 2348, 34 Stat. 182, Congress amended this
section so as distinctly to postpone to the expiration of the
trust period the subjection of allottees under that act to
state laws. The first part of the section as amended is:
"That at the expiration of the 'trust period and when the

lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in
fee, as provided in section five of this act, then each and
every allottee shall have the benefit of and be subject to
the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or Territory
in which they may reside." And, at the same time, there
was added to the section the explicit proviso: "That until
the issuance of fee-simple patents all allottees to whom
trust patents shall hereafter be issued shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States." We
deem it to be clear that Congress had the power thus to
continue the guardianship of the Government. (United
States v. Kagama, 118 U. S.375, 383, 384; United States v.
Celestine, supra; Tiger v. Western Investment Company,
supra; Hallowell v. United States, supra; Heckman v.
United States, 224 U. S.413, 437; Ex parte Webb, 225 U. S.
663, 683; United States v. Wright, supra; United States v.
Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 46; Perrin v. United States, decided this day, post, p. 478); and these provisions leave no
room for doubt as to the intent of Congress with respect
to the maintenance of the Federal jurisdiction over the
allotted lands described in the indictment.
A cognate question is presented as to the status of the
person with whose murder the defendants are charged.
It is not alleged in the indictment that the defendants were
Indians and we assume that they were not. But the court
below had jurisdiction if the deceased was an Indian ward.
Donnelly v. United States, supra, pp. 269-272. It is
alleged, as already stated, that the deceased was "a fullblood Indian, a member of the Colville tribe," and, further,
that he had received an allotment of land under the act of
1887, as amended in 1891, and under the act of July 1,
1892, the land being held in trust by the United States for
twenty-five years from the date of the patent, July 31,
1900. Upon this statement, the deceased must be regarded as one who was still under the Government's care.
Congress had not terminated that relation, and the com-

mission of a crime against his person upon Indian lands,
such as we have found the allotted lands in question to be,

The order sustaining the demurrer is reversed and the

proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

GAUTHIER v. MORRISON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON.
No. 157.

Argued December 19, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1914.

Where one specially asserts in the state court a right predicated on the
statutes of the United States to enter upon, and remain in possession
of, public land, and that right is denied, this court has jurisdiction to
review the judgment of the State Court under § 237 Judicial Code.
The surveyor is not invested with authority to determine the character
of land surveyed or left unsurveyed or to classify it as within or
without the operation of particular laws.
Under the Homestead Law of the United States unsurveyed public
lands, if agricultural and unappropriated, are open to settlement by
qualified entrymen, and this applies to land of that description left
unsurveyed by a surveyor by erroneously marking it on the plat as
included within the meander lines of a lake.
One who forces a qualified entryman who has acquired, in compliance
with the Homestead Law, an inceptive homestead right on public
land open to entry although erroneously shown on the plat as a
lake, wrongfully invades the possessory right of the homesteader.
While the Land Department controls the surveying of the public lands
and the courts have no power to revise a survey, the courts can
determine whether the land was left unsurveyed and whether a
right of possession exists under an inceptive claim.
Courts should not interfere with the Land Department in administrative affairs and before patent has issued, but it is not an interference
