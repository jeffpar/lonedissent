rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is
no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under
present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in
accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily
overruled.
The other objection to the procedure in the state court
which it is alleged deprived-the plaintiff in error of due
process of law upon his trial, rests in the contention that
he was put to trial upon two informations, containing
different charges, without notice as to which charge he
would be required to meet, and sentenced upon a general
verdict of guilty. We think that the record discloses that
there is nothing in this objection of substantial merit, and
that it appears that the accused was put-to trial and convicted upon the second information, with every opportunity to defend himself against the offense therein charged.
Judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is

Affirmed.

No. 182.

Argued January 21,.22, 1914.-Decided March 16, 1914.

Errors alleged to have been committed by the trial court which do not
involve anything fundamental or jurisdictional must be regarded as
waived if they were not presented to the Supreme Court of the
Territory.
An action by the United States to recover penalties under the Alien
Contract Labor Law is civil and attended with the usual incidents
of a civil action. United States v. Regan, ante, p. 37.
Where an action for penalties was tried on the theory that the defend-

ant was not liable unless the violations were knowingly committed
and the jury returns a verdict against the defendant after being
charged that knowledge is an essential element of the cause of action,
the petition, if omitting an allegation of knowledgecan be regarded
as amended to conform to the facts, the defendants not being prejudiced thereby.
It is most unreasonable to reverse a judgment for a defect in pleading
by which the defendant has been in no way prejudiced.
The trial court was right in refusing to suppress depositions because the
notices in regard to taking them were defective in certain respects
which could not and did not mislead the parties.
While, as a general rule, a judgment binds only the parties and their
privies, a judgment in a prior action may be admissible against a
stranger as primafacie, although not conclusive, proof of facts which
may be shown by evidence of general reputation--such as alienage.
The decision of a board of special inquiry that certain persons were
aliens was properly admitted in a suit by the United States to recover
penalties for violations of the Alien Contract Labor Act, as prima
facie evidence of the alienage of the persons before the board.
In this case, it appears from the evidence that there was proof other
than of the acts of the professed agent to show his agency, and there
was also sufficient testimony to make it a question for the jury to determine whether the instructions given by the defendant to its agent
not to violate the Alien Contract Labor Act were given in good faith.
Under the Alien Contract Labor Act a separate penalty shall be assessed
in respect of each alien; and this is so notwithstanding all the aliens
for whose employment penalties are asked were brought into the
United States at one time. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v.
United States, 231 U. S. 112.
Ther6 was no error in this case in rendering judgment against defendants for costs.
13 Arizona, 388, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a judgment
obtained by the United States for penalties for violation
of the Alien Contract Labor Law, are stated in the opinion.

tion for the acts of its servants and agents, and the criminal liability of a corporation for the criminal acts of its
servants or agents is important in this case.
A master or principal is not liable criminally for the
criminal acts of his servant or agent unless he directed,
assented to or acquiesced in such illegal acts.
If the master does not aid or abet, countenance or approve, or have knowledge, of the act of his servants, it is
the general rule that he cannot be punished criminally
therefor, Taylor v. Nixon (1910), 2 I. R. 94; Rex v.

offense has no application to the present case. St. Louis

There is no evidence in the case at bar which can justify
or support a verdict for the Government involving a
finding that the defendant construction company knowingly induced, assisted, encouraged or solicited, or caused
to be induced, assisted, encouraged or solicited, the migration or importation of any of the forty-five laborers
named in the complaint.
The majority of laborers engaged in railroad construction work in Arizona are of Mexican descent.
It was proper and lawful for anyone to employ, in the
United States, Mexican citizens who had migrated to the
United States, whether of their own accord, or whether
they had been unlawfully induced to come by the acts of
others, not known to the employer.
There is no evidence that defendant's contract with
Carney authorized or contemplated any violation whatever of the immigration act; the undisputed evidence'
shows that it gave strict orders not to assist, encourage or
solicit the importation or migration of any laborers from
Mexico, and not to even talk to laborers in Mexico.
The positive and specific instructions given to Carney
were given in absolute good faith. There is no evidence to
the contrary. This is the only conclusion which can be
drawn from the evidence as a matter of law.
The knowledge contemplated by the statute, essential
to be proven in the case at bar, is actual knowledge, and
not constructive knowledge or notice of facts which, upon
inquiry, would lead to actual knowledge.
There is no evidence that any of defendant's officers
had any actual knowledge of the illegal acts of Carney and
others acting under him.

GRANT BROS. v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

There is no evidence that the defendant itself furnished
conveyance or transportation, or paid any of the expenses
of said laborers from Mexico to the United States.
Proof of the alienage of each and every of the forty-five
laborers named in each of the forty-five counts respectively
of the complaint was essential under the statute. There
was no proof as to thirty-five. The mere fact that the
laborers were of Mexican descent is no proof that they
were born in Mexico.
As the act makes the offense a misdemeanor, the Government, even when proceeding for the penalty only,
must furnish the degree of proof required in a criminal
case. United States v. Regan, 203 Fed. Rep. 433; Boyd v.
United States, 116 U. S. 616; Lees v. United States, 150

W. H. Small & Co. v. Commonwealth, 134 Kentucky, 272.
The court erred in refusing to charge the jury that their
verdict if for the Government could not exceed one thousand dollars. There was but one act done, one offense
committed, and but one penalty incurred, and not fortyfive offenses nor forty-five penalties.
Under the statute one shipment of laborers constitutes
but one misdemeanor, and but one penalty is incurred.
One act cannot be split or divided into many offenses and
the penalties thereby multiplied. Balt. & Ohio S. W. R. R.

but were not, corrected by the appellate court.

GRANT BROS. v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The portions of the statute upon which the action was
founded are as follows:
"SEc. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be
excluded from admission into the United States:
persons hereinafter called contract laborers, who have
been induced or solicited to migrate to this country by
offers or promises of employment or in consequence of
agreements, oral, written or printed, express or implied,
to perform labor in this country of any kind, skilled or
unskilled; . . . And provided further, That skilled
labor may be imported if labor of like kind unemployed
cannot be found in this country: And provided further,
That the provisions of this law applicable to contract
labor shall not be held to exclude professional actors,
artists, lecturers, singers, ministers of any religious denomination, professors for colleges or seminaries, persons
belonging to any recognized learned profession, or persons
employed strictly as personal or domestic servants.
"SEc. 4. That it shall be a misdemeanor for any person,
company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner
whatsoever, to prepay the transportation or in any way to
assist or encourage the importation or migration of any
contract laborer or contract laborers into the United
States, unless such contract laborer or contract laborers
are exempted under the terms of the last two provisos
contained in section two of this Act.
"SEc. 5. 'That for every violation of any of the provisions of section four of this Act the persons, partnership;
company, or corporation violating the same, by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or soliciting the migration
or importation of any contract laborer into the United
States shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum
of one thousand dollars, which may be sued for and recovered by the United States, or by any person who shall

own benefit, including any such alien thus promised labor
or service of any kind as aforesaid, as debts of like amount
are now recovered in the courts of the United States; and
separate suits may be brought for each alien thus promised
labor or service of any kind as aforesaid. And it shall be
the duty of the district attorney of the proper district to
prosecute every such suit when brought by the United
States."
The petition contained forty-five counts, each charging,
with considerable detail, that the defendant, by offers and
promises of employment and by providing transportation
and paying expenses, assisted, encouraged and solicited
the migration and importation into the United States from
Mexico of a designated alien laborer who was not within
the terms of either of the last two provisos in §2 of the
statute. A different alien laborer was named in each
count, and the date of the offending act was given in all as
October 29, 1909.
In a preliminary way, the evidence tended to show these
facts: The construction company was building a line of
railroad in southern Arizona, near Naco, a town on the
international boundary. Laborers in large numbers were
required for the work, and in Augu~t, 1909, the company
employed one Carney to procure laborers for it and to
take them to the vicinity of the work. For this he was to
be paid one dollar in gold for each laborer secured and
twenty cents for each meal provided while they were en
route. It was contemplated that he would arrange with
others to aid him, and he secured the assistance of Holler,
Rupelius and Randall, who, like himself, were located at
Nogales, another boundary town. Under this employment
Carney procured, and the company accepted, prior to the
transaction in question, about 450 laborers, 95 per cent.
of whom were Mexicans. Many of these came across the
line on their own initiative and were then engaged by
Holler, but a substantial number were engaged in Mexico

Opinion of the Court.

by Rupelius and then brought into the United States at
Nogales. Only a few days before the transaction in question, Rupelius gathered together 80 or 90 in Mexico and
induced them to enter the United States at Nogales by
promising that the construction company would employ
them, which it did.
As respects the 45 laborers named in the petition there
was evidence tending to show the following: These men
were citizens of Mexico and were unskilled laborers who
were not within the exemptions specified in the last two
provisos in § 2 of the statute. They were secured at Hermosillo, Mexico, by Rupelius, October 28, 1909, were
brought into the United States, at Naco, by Randall the
next day, were there taken into custody by an immigration
inspector, and were examined before a board of special
inquiry. The board found that they were alien contract
laborers, ordered that they be excluded, and notified them
of the order and of their right to an appeal. After coiasulting with the Mexican Consul at Naco they waived that
right, and most of them were returned to Mexico, a few
being detained as witnesses. Rupelius had induced them
to, leave Hermosillo and come into the United States by
offers and promises of employment by the construction
company. They were brought to Naco upon a railroad
pass procured by Carney and purporting to have been
issued on account of the construction company, and their
only meal en route was provided by Holler at Carney's
suggestion. During the latter part of their journey they
were in charge of Randall, who had been directed by
Carney to deliver them to McDonald, an agent of the construction company, who was expected to be at Naco to
receive them. McDonald was there, having come in from
one of the company's camps that day. He endeavored to
hasten the proceedings before the board of inquiry in order
that he might get the men out to the camp that afternoon,
and also provided a meal for them while the proceedings

were in progress. This was the first party of Mexicans
that Carney had-attempted to bring into the country at
Naco. Others had been brought in at Nogales. According to his statement, the inspection officers at the latter
place had been particularly liberal in admitting Mexican
laborers procured for the construction company; and he
suggested to the inspectors at Naco that like action on
their part would be appreciated, but the suggestion did not
find favor with them.
There were some direct contradictions in the evidence,
different portions gave rise to opposing inferences, and
parts of it were more or less improbable; but as it was the
province of the jury to pass on such matters, which it did
by the verdict, they require no other notice than they will
receive presently.
As several of the alleged errors, not involving anything
fundamental or jurisdictional, were not presented to the
appellate court for consideration, they must be regarded
as waived and will be passed without further notice.

It is complained that the trial court permitted the Government to read in evidence the depositions of absent witnesses, instructed the jury to return a verdict for the Government if the evidence reasonably preponderated in its
favor, and in other ways treated the case as civil in substance as well as in form. But the trial court was right.
An action such as this is civil and is attended with the
usual incidents of a civil action. United States v. Regan,

The petition did not allege that the acts charged against
the construction company were knowingly done, and it is
said that this operated to render the recovery erroneous.
No doubt the petition was defective. A right to the penalty arises only where § 4 is violated "by knowingly assisting, encouraging or soliciting the migration or impor-

tation" of an alien contract laborer into the United States.
Knowledge being an element of what is penalized, it must
be included in the statement of a cause of action for the
penalty. But there are reasons why the defect did not
render the recovery erroneous. The defect was not pointed
out in the trial court. On the contrary', the case was tried
as if the omitted allegation were in the petition. Both
parties introduced evidence bearing upon the company's
knowledge, both presented requests for instructions treating it as an essential factor in the case, and the jury was
instructed upon that theory. In its charge the court said
that before any verdict could be returned for the Government it must appear from the evidence that some representative of the defendant company, for whose act it
would be responsible, "knowingly assisted or knowingly
encouraged or knowingly solicited or knowingly caused
others to assist or encourage or solicit the migration or importation of an alien Mexican contract laborer into the
United States." And again: "Where knowledge is an
essential ingredient of a cause of action, the existence of
the knowledge becomes a question to be determined by
the jury, upon a consideration of all the facts and circumstances in the case." It is therefore quite plain that the
jury found from the evidence that the acts charged against
the defendant were knowingly done, and the petition may
well be treated as amended to conform to the facts. Ariz.
Rev. Stat. 1901, §§ 1288, 1293; Reynolds v. Stockton, 140
U. S.254, 266. The defendant was in no Wise prejudiced
by the defect, and to make it a ground for reversing the
judgment, notwithstanding the theory upon which the
trial proceeded, would be most unreasonable. San Juan

the clerk. The only ground for the motion to which our
attention is invited is that the preliminary notice described
the case as pending in the second district when it was pending in the first. The case had been brought in the former,
and was transferred to the latter at the defendant's instance. The notice and accompanying interrogatories
were prepared before and served after the transfer. The
purpose of the notice was to inform defendant's counsel
of the intended application for a commission and of the
proposed interrogatories and to give opportunity for filing
cross-interrogatories. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. 1901, §§ 2507,
2513. No cross-interrogatories were filed in either district,
and after the expiration of the time allowed for them the
clerk of the district in which the case was pending issued
the commission. Counsel for the defendant could not have
been misled or confused by the error in the notice, for they
were fully informed of the transfer, having perfected it the
day before the notice was served. In these circumstances
the trial court, as also the Supreme Court of the Territory,
held that the error was inconsequential and did not require
the suppression of the depositions. We perceive no reason
for disturbing that conclusion. On the contrary, we think
it was plainly correct.
Over the defendant's objection, the decision of the board
of special inquiry was admitted in evidence as tending to
prove that the 45 men were aliens, and it is said that this
was error because the defendant was not a party to the
proceeding. One of the questions committed by law to the
board for decision, subject to an appeal to the Secretary
of Commerce, was 'whether the men were aliens. The
document admitted in evidence disclosed that, after a
hearing, the board determined that question in the affirmative, and that the men acquiesced by waiving their
right to an appeal. In that way their status as aliens was
conclusively established as between themselves and the
United States. It is true that the defendant was not a

Opinion of the Court.

party to that proceeding, and that as a general rule a judgment binds only the parties and their privies. But it is
equally true that a judgment in a prior action is admissible,
even against a stranger, as primafacie, but not conclusive,
proof of a fact which may be shown by evidence of general
reputation, such as custom, pedigree, race, death and the
like, and this because the judgment is usually more persuasive than mere evidence of reputation. 1 Starkie Ev.

6 How. 550, 599; Pile v. McBratney, 15 Illinois, 314, 319;
McCollum v. Fitzsimons, 1 Rich. (So. Car.) 252. In principle, alienage is within the latter rule, and so the board's
decision was properly admitted in evidence for the purpose stated.
Considerable evidence was admitted, over the defendant's objection, of the acts and declarations of Carney and
his assistants while they were procuring laborers in Mexico
and bringing them into the United States, and it is contended that this was violative of the rule that the acts
and declarations of a professed agent are not admissible
to prove the existence or extent of his agency. See United
States v. Boyd, 5 How. 29, 50, But the contention rests
upon a misconception of what the record discloses. This
evidence was not admitted to establish the agency or its
extent, but to show that the laborers came into the United
States in circumstances which rendered their migration or
importation unlawful. Whether the defendant was responsible for what was done was another question. The
trial court recognized this and expressly ruled that the
agency must be otherwise shown, and we agree with the
territorial courts in thinking there was other evidence
tending to prove the agency and that it embraced what
was done.
The evidence disclosed that when the arrangement was
made with Carney, and on one or two occasions thereafter, he was in terms instructed not to engage any laborer

in Mexico and not to induce or assist any laborer to migrate
thence into the United States, and because of this it is
said that the evidence afforded no basis for holding the
defendant responsible for the acts of Carney and his assistants in inducing and aiding the migration or importation of the laborers named in the petition. In dealing
with this point the courts below held that under the evidence as a whole it was an admissible conclusion that the
instructions to Carney were not given in good faith or
were in effect abrogated by acquiescence in their nonobservance. An examination of the evidence as set forth
in the record satisfies us that it afforded reasonable support for either of these conclusions and therefore that the
questioin was properly one for the jury. And upon looking
at the court's charge as incorporated into the record we
find that the matter was fairly and adequately submitted.
Although conceding that there was evidence that ten of
the men were citizens of Mexico, the company claims that
there was no evidence of the alienage of the other thirtyfive. It must be held otherwise. Not only did the decision
of the board of incuiry constitute such evidence, but it
was distinctly testified by some of the men, who became
witnesses at the trial, that "they were all Mexicans,"
meaning thereby, as the context shows, that they were all
citizens of Mexico.
Still another contention is that as all the men named in
the petition were brought into the United States at one
time there was but a single violation of the statute and
only one penalty could be recovered. The statute declares
that "separate suits may be brought for each alien thus
promised labor or service," and this plainly means that a
separate penalty shall be assessed in respect of each alien
whose migration or importation is knowingly assisted,
encouraged or solicited in contravention of the statute.

Where one has been convicted for violating a state statute which is
unconstitutional as applied to the act committed, the conviction
cannot be sustained because there was proof of another violation
with which he was not charged, as conviction for the latter would
be condemnation without hearing which would be denial of due process of law.
