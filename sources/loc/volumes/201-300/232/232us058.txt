NATIONAL SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY v. STEAD,
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 138.

Argued December 16, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

The word "possession" is more or less ambiguous, and is interchangeably used to describe both actual and constructive possession; and
not decided in this case whether the contents of a safe deposit box
are in possession of the renter or of the Deposit Company.
The State has power to regulate the incidents of distribution of property within the State belonging to decedents, and can prescribe times
and conditions for delivery thereof by safe deposit companies; and
a statute operating to seal safe deposit boxes for a reasonable period
after the death of the renter is not an unconstitutional deprivation
of property without due process of law, and so held as to ยง 9 of the
Inheritance Tax Law of Illinois of 1909.
Such a statute does not impair the obligation of the charter of a safe
deposit company if it provides the conditions under which delivery
shall be made to the proper parties within a reasonable period.
The prohibition in the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable
searches and seizures does not apply to the States. Lloyd v. Dollison,
194 U. S. 445.
Contracts for joint rental of safe deposit boxes are made in the light of
the State's power to legislate for the protection of the estate of any
joint renter, and a statute preventing withdrawal of contents for a
reasonable period does not impair the contract between the deposit
company and the renters.
The renter of a safe deposit box cannot object to a state statute affecting his right to open the box after death of a joint renter which was in
force when the rental contract was made.
250 Illinois, 584, affirmed.

By the act of July 1, 1909, the Illinois legislature passed
an Inheritance Tax Law like that considered in Magoun
v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283. The ninth
section of the statute provides in substance:
That no safe deposit company, corporation or person

having in possession or under control securities or assets
belonging to or standing in the name of a decedent, or in
the joint iname of the decedent and another person, or in
the name of a partnership of which he was a membershall deliver such assets, to the legal representative of the
deceased or to the survivor of the joint-holders or to the
partnership of which he was a member, without ten days'
notice to the Attorney General and Treasurer of the State,
who were authorized to examine the securities at the time
of the delivery. It was further provided that no delivery
should be made unless such holder should retain a sufficient portion of the assets to pay the state tax thereafter
assessed, unless such state officers gave consent in writing.
Failure to give the notice or to retain such amount rendered the deposit company, corporation or person, liable
for the tax and to a penalty of $1,000.
On March 15, 1910, the National Safe Deposit Company
filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, a bill
against the Treasurer and Attorney General, alleging that
the Company was incorporated in 1881 to do a safe deposit
business and that in pursuance of its charter it had erected
a building with large vaults into which 13,291 safe deposit
boxes had been built and 9,702 rented-317 to partnerships and 4,104 were held jointly by more than one person.
That prior to July 1, 1909, it had made yearly contracts
for the rental of said boxes, most of which were still of
force. The rent contracts recited that in consideration of
$--

paid, the Company "had rented to

safe No.
in the vaults of this company for the
term of one year," and that its liability was limited to the
exercise of ordinary diligence in preventing the opening
of the safe by any person other than the renter or his duly
authorized representative. "No one except the renter, or
his deputy to be designated in writing on the books of the
company, or in case of death, his legal representative, to
have access to the safe."

No renter will be

permitted to enter the vaults except in the presence of the
vaultkeeper. In case of loss of key or combination the
lock will be changed at the expense of the renter.
The bill alleged that the safes could be opened only by
two keys, or two combinations, one of which keys or combinations was held by or known only to the renter, the
other being held or known only by. the company's agents.
So that it required the joint act of the customer and the
Company to secure access to the contents,-the Company
having no right or means of access to the box itself, nor
did -t possess any knowledge or information as to the
ownership of the securities deposited therein.
Tlie bill further alleged that notwithstanding these facts,
the defendants, insisted that the Deposit Company had
such possession or control of the contents as to make it incumbent upon it to prevent access thereto by all persons
for ten days after the death of the sole or joint-renter; that
this deprived the Deposit Company of the right to do the
business for which it had been chartered, made it break its
contract that it would allow no one except the renter or
his agent or representative to have access to the boxes;
interfered with its business by depriving the representative and survivor of their right to use the box and contents; imposed upon the Deposit Company the risk of determining who was the owner of the contents of the box
and imposed the duty of acting as a tax-collecting agent
for the State. The bill also alleged that the Company had
been threatened with suits by depositors if it yielded to
the command of such void act. In order to prevent a
multiplicity of suits and to avoid the heavy statutory
penalties the Company prayed that the defendants be
enjoined from enforcing the statute against it.
The defendants' demurrer was sustained. That ruling.
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois, three
judges dissenting (250 Illinois, 584). The case was then
brought here by writ of error.

Argument for Plaintiff in Eiror.

Mr. George Packard and Mr. John S. Miller, with
whom Mr. Merritt Starr was on the brief, for plaintiff in
error:
The relation of bailor and bailee does not exist between
the safe deposit company and its customers; it is rather
that of lessor and lessee of a diminutive room called a
box. Tullock v. Mulvane, 184 U. S. 513.
Only in exceptional cases does the company assume
a right of forcible entry.
The elements of possession, control and bailment are
absolutely wanting. Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, 198

New York, 134 U. S. 594; Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220

Where an impairment of contract or a deprivation of
property rights without due process are relied upon, this
court will determine for itself the existence and nature
of the contract or the property right. Hoadley v. San
Francisco, 124 U. S. 645; Scott v. McNeal, 154 U. S.
34, 45.
The statute deprives the company of the right to pursue a lawful business, free from legislative burdens which
are not imposed through such police regulations as are
consistent with constitutional guaranties. The right to
contract is property in this sense.
S~ction 9 of the act imposes possession, control and
power of transfer. It incorrectly assumes that a deposit

company has in its possession or under its control the contents of its rented boxes and can deliver or transfer the
same.
"Possession" means exercise of power over a corporate
thing, at pleasure, to the exclusion of all others. Union

"Control" has no legal or technical meaning apart from
its popular sense, and is synonymous with "manage."
Ure v. Ure, 185 Illinois, 216, 218.
Taking possession and control and the right to possession and control from the box lessee's personal representative and bestowing it on the safe deposit lessor against
its consent, in direct conflict with the basic principle
of the safety deposit business, is a legislative interference
amounting to a deprivation without process of law, of the
latter's right to carry on its lawful business. State v.

Illinois, 69.
A lawful vocation is not to be arbitrarily and vexatiously burdened. People v. Steele, 231 Illinois, 351.
There is no process of law. The mere passage of the
act making interference with plaintiff in error's business
possible is not due process of law. Davidson v. New

Much of the business of safety deposit is with joint box
renters. A surviving joint box renter, having a right of
exclusive access to the joint box, by being denied access
to his own property, is deprived of liberty and property
without due process and is denied-the equal protection of
the laws. City v. Wells, 236 Illinois, 129, 132.
The superimposed construction of the act that the law
extends to surviving business partners of business copartnerships holding boxes in the partnership name, is
unconstitutional. Where one is clothed with the State's
powers, his acts are those of the State. Raymond v. Chicago
Traction Co., 207 U. S. 20, 35; Chicago &c. R. R. v. Chicago,
166 U. S. 233.
That the purpose of the act is to effectuate the ascertainment and collection of a tax, does not justify its summary disregard of constitutional rights.

Opinion of the Court.

deposit boxes for at least ten days after the death of the
renter. In view of the uncertainty as to who might own
the contents of boxes, standing in the joint name of the
deceased and others, the statute sealed their boxes also
for a like period. The act further provided that in neither
case could the securities be removed except after notice
to officers designated by the State, and even then the
Company was required to retain possession of enough of
the assets to pay the State's tax. The Deposit Company
insists that this statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment, for that, without due process of law, it imposed upon
the Company a duty as to property over which it had no
control; required it to assume the risk of determining who
was the true owner, and forced upon it the obligations and
liabilities of a tax-collecting agent of the State. In the
court below and on the argument here, the validity of the
section under review was said to depend upon the relation
between the Company and the renter-it being argued for
the State that the contract was one of bailment where, on
the death of the bailor, the Deposit Company, as bailee,
was bound to surrender the securities to the owner or
person having a right thereto, one of whom, in each case,
was the State to the extent of its tax. On the other hand,
the complainant insisted that if there was no possession
in fact there could be no possession in law; and that if no
possession existed it was beyond the power even of the
legislature to charge the Company with liabilities that
could only arise out of a possession actually existing.
This is one of that class of cases which illustrate the
fact that, both in common speech and in legal terminology,
there is no word more ambiguous in its meaning than
Possession. It is interchangeably used to describe actual
possession and constructive possession which often so
shade into one another that it is difficult to say where one
ends and the other begins. Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, 198
U. S. 530, 537. Custody may be in the servant and pos-

session in the master; or title and right of control may be
in one and the property within the protection of the house
of another, as in Bottom v. Clarke, 7 Cush. 487, 489, where
such possession of a locked trunk was held not to include
possession of the contents. So that, as pointed out by
Pollock and Wright in their work on the subject, controversies arising out of mixed possession have inevitably
led to many subtle refinements in order to determine the
rights of conflicting claimants, or to lay the proper charge
of ownership in prosecutions for larceny of goods belonging
to one inthe custody of another or found by the defendant.
In the present case, however, the Federal question presented by the record does not call for a decision as to the
exact relation between the parties during the life of the
renter,-whether there was a strict bailment; whether the
renter was in possession of the box with the Deposit Company as guard over the contents; whether the property
was in the custody of the Company with the renter having
a license to enter the building and remov'e the securities;
or whether, as held in People v. Mercantile Safe Deposit
Co. (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 143 N. Y. Supp, 849), construing a
similar statute of New York-the relation was that which
exists between tenants and landlord of an office building
who keeps under his control the general means of access
to the building and offices therein, but as to which offices
and their contents, the rights of the tenants are exclusive.
The Illinois Supreme Court held that the relation created
by the Deposit Company's contract was that of bailor and
bailee. That construction by the state court is controlling, unless, as claimed by the complainant, it makes the
statute violate the Fourteenth Amendment as being an
arbitrary attempt to create liabilities arising out of possession, where there was no possession in fact.
Certainly the person who rented the box was not in
actual possession of its contents. For the valuables were

NAT. SAFE DEP. CO. v. ILLINOIS.

Opinion of the Court.

in a safe built into the company's vault and therefore in a
sense "under the protection of the house." The owner
could not obtain access to the box without being admitted
to the vault, nor could he open the box without the use
of the company's master key. Both in law, and by the
express provisions of the contract, the company stood in
such relation to the property as to make it liable if, during
the lifetime of the owner, it negligently permitted unauthorized persons to remove the contents, even though
it might be under color of legal process. Roberts v. Safe
Deposit Company, 123 N. Y. 57; Mayer v. Brensinger, 180
Illinois, 110. After his death, it would be likewise liable if
it permitted unauthorized persons, be they heirs, legal
representatives, or joint-renters, to take the property of
the decedent. In the exercise of its power to provide for
the distribution of his property, the State could make it
unlawful, except on conditions named, for his personal
representative to receive or the holder to deliver, effects
belonging, or apparently belonging, in whole or in part,
to the deceased. As the State could provide for the appointment of administrators, for the distribution to heirs
or legatees of all the property of the deceased and for the
payment of a tax on the transfer, it could, of course, legislate as to the incidents attending the collection of the tax
and the time when the administrator or executor could
take possession. If, before representatives were appointed
any one, having the goods in possession or control, delivered them to an unauthorized person he would be held
liable as an executor de son tort. The fixing by this statute
of the time and condition on which delivery might be made
by a deposit company was also, in effect, a limitation on
the right of the heir or representatives to take possession.
If they had no right to receive except on compliance with
the statutory conditions, neither could the Safe Deposit
Company, as bailee or custodian, surrender the contents
except upon like compliance with statutory conditions.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

The contention that the Company could not be arbitrarily charged with the duty of supervising the delivery
and determining to whom the securities belonged is answered by the fact that in law and by contract it had such
control as to make it liable for allowing unauthorized
persons to take possession. Both by the nature of its
business and the terms of its contract it had assumed the
obligation cast upon those having possession of property
claimed by different persons. If the parties could not
agree as to who owned the securities the Company had the
same remedy by Bill of Interpleader that was afforded all
others confronted with similar conditions. There was
certainly nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in compelling
one, who had received such control of property from another, to surrender it after his death only to those having
the right thereto. Nor was there any deprivation of
property; nor any arbitrary imposition of a liability, in
requiring the Company to retain assets sufficient to pay
the tax that might be due to the State. There are many
instances in which, by statute, the amount of the tax due
by one is to be reported and paid by another-as in the
case of banks required to pay the tax on the shares of a
stockholder. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall.
353, 363. These conclusions answer the other constitutional objections and make it unnecessary to deal with each
of them separately at length.
It is contended that the statute impaired the complainant's charter power to do a safe deposit business. But it
no more interferes with the right of the Company to do
that business than it does with the right of a private person to contract to take possession or control of securities
belonging to another. But, having regard to the radical
change wrought by the death of the owner and the subsequent duty to make delivery to one authorized by law
to receive possession, the statute points out when and on
what conditions such delivery may be made to the per-

Opinion of the Court.

sonal representative, surviving partners or persons jointly
interested.
The objection that the act, in directing the state officers
to inspect the contents of the box, operates as an unreasonable search and seizure raises no Federal question, since
the prohibition on that subject in the Fourth Amendment,
does not apply to the States. Ohio ex rel. Lloyd v. Dollison,
194 U. S. 445, 447.
The claim that the statute compels the company to
break its contract with joint-renters and deprives the
latter, for ten days, of access to the box and the right to
use it or remove the contents is without merit. The
Company, joint-renters or firms, each made the contract
in the light of the State's power to legislate for the protection of the estate of any one of the joint-renters or partners, that might die during the term. As it now appears
that all of the rentals were from year to year, and that
all had expired before final hearing and were renewed
after the passage of the law, it can also be said that all
such contracts of joint-rental are made in the light of the
provisions of this particular statute. The boxes were
leased with the knowledge that the State had so legislated
as not only to protect the interests of one dying after the
rental, but also to secure the payment of the state tax out
of whatever might be found in the box belonging to the
deceased. The inconvenience was one of the not unreasonable incidents of the joint-relationship.
Judgment affirmed.
