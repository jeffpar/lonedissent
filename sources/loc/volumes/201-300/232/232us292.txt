CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. William D. Guthrie for the yacht owner in this and
other cases argued simultaneously herewith. 1
Mr. Assistant Attorney GeneralAdkins, with whom Mr.

Karl W. Kirchwey was on the brief, for the United States.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the

court.
These cases concern the right to recover a tax on the
yacht Yacona, becoming due on the first of September,
1910. The complaint filed by the United States in No. 65
was in substance like that filed in the previous cases and
the answer in effect set up the same defenses, especially
the defense relating to the non-use of the yacht. The case,
by stipulation, was submitted to the court without a jury,
a finding of facts was made which distinctly established

Statement of the Case.

the non-use during the taxing year and the court gave a

judgment for the tax, although it rejected the interest,
upon the same construction of the act which it applied
in the previous cases. The certificate in this as in the other
cases is here in consequence of error prosecuted by the
United States to the Circuit Court of Appeals, because

of the rejection of the interest claimed.

Treating this

case as we treated the others and applying the construc-

tion in those cases given, it follows that the judgment
in this case must be reversed.
And it is 8o ordered.

CERTIFICATES FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND

Nos. 631, 632.

CIRCUIT.

Argued January 6, 7, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.

Billings v. United States, ante, p. 261, followed to the effect that the
tax on the use of foreign-built yachts imposed by ยง 37 of the Tariff
Act of 1909 is not an unconstitutional exercise of power by Congress,
and it became due for the year 1909 on the first day of September,
1909.
While Congress may have the power to impose an excise duty on a
citizen permanently domiciled abroad, such an imposition is so unusual that an intent to do so will not be presumed unless clearly expressed.
The expectation of those who sought the enactment of legislation may
not be used for the purpose of affixing to such legislation, when
enacted, a meaning which it does not express.
The tax imposed by ยง 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909 does not apply to the
use of a foreign-built yacht owned by a citizen of the United States
who was permanently resident and domiciled in a foreign country
for more than one year prior to September 1, 1909, and to the levy
of such tax.
THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality of ยง 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909, imposing a tax
