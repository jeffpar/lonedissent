IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

HAWLEY v. CITY OF MALDEN.
ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 18.

Argued March 6, 7, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

The property of shareholders in their respective shares is distinct from
the corporate property, franchises and capital stock of the corporation itself and may be separately taxed.
Even if the constitutional validity of the taxation by a State of shares
owned by its citizens of stock of foreign corporations having no
property and doing no business therein has not been definitely raised

and directly passed upon by this court, the existence of the authority
of the State has invariably been assumed. Darnell v. Indiana,226
U. S. 390.
In dealing with the intangible interest of a shareholder there is no
question of physical situs, and the jurisdiction to tax such interest is
not dependent upon the tangible property of the corporation.
A State has the undoubted right, in creating corporations, to provide
for the taxation in that State of all their shares, whether owned
by residents or non-residents. Corry v. Baltimore, 196 U. S. 406.
Quwre, whether in case of corporations organized under state laws a
provision by the State of incorporation fixing the situs of shares for
the purpose of taxation, by whomsoever owned, would exclude
taxation of those shares by other States in which the owners reside.

While it would be an advantage to the country and to individual
States if non-conflicting principles of taxation could be agreed upon
by the States so as to avoid the taxation of the same property in more
than one jurisdiction, the Constitution of the United States does not
go so far. Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730.
204 Massachusetts, 138, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of an assessment for taxation under authority of the State of shares
of stock owned by residents of the State of foreign corporations which did no business and has no property
within the State, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Courtenay Crocker and Mr. Nathan Matthews for
plaintiff in error:
Whether a tax by a State upon a resident thereof in
respect of shares of stock owned by him in foreign corporations deprives him of his property without due process of
law, in violation of the Fourteenith Amendment, because
the property represented by the stock is not property
within the State, has never been squarely presented to or
decisively passed upon by this court. This point was not
passed on in Sturges v. Carter, 114 U. S. 511; Kidd v.
Alabama, 188 U. S.730; Wright v. L. & N. R.R., 195 U. S.
219; Darnell v. Indiana,226 U. S. 390.
By analogy to the national bank decisions shares should
only be taxed in the State where the company is organized
and does business. See People v. Commissioners, 4 Wall.

State is void on general principles, as the State can have

Taxes cannot be levied on corporate franchises belonging to a resident but granted by the United States, California v. Pacific R. R., 127 U. S. 1, 40, or by another
State, Louisville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U. S. 385.
In holding that a State cannot tax property not within
its limits, the court draws no distinction between tangible
and intangible property. It is the situs that controls.
Buck v. Beach, 206 U. S. 392, 401; So. Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U. S. 63, 68; N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. v. Miller,

491; Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592.
The rule mobilia sequuntur personam is a legal fiction;
it must always give way in matters of taxation to the
facts of the case; it does not authorize taxation at the
domicile of the owner of property which, whether tangible
or intangible, is actually located and protected in some
other State. For the history of the rule in its limited application to the law of taxation, see Green v. Van Buskirk,
7 Wall. 139, 150; St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423, 430;

While some forms of indebtedness may be subject to
taxation in two States, such as debts secured by mortgage
on real estate, Kirtlandv. Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491; Savings
Society v. Multnomah County, 169 U. S. 421; New Orleans
v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309; Bristol v. Washington County, 177
U. S. 133, if the mortgage is a mere lien on the land, unsupported by any note, bond, or personal indebtedness, it
could not be taxed at the domicile of the holder, if a resident of another State.
Deposits of money and certain forms of credit may be
so localized as to be subject to taxation in the State where
the deposits are made or the credits given, New Orleans v.

credits are also taxable as technical debts in the State of
Liverpool Ins. Co. v.
the creditor's domicile, is doubtfl
Assessors, 221 U. S. 346.
A State cannot reach for taxation property which itself
is not subject to taxation, by means of a tax upon the documents which represent the property. Almy v. California,

Selliger v. Kentucky, 213 U. S. 200; Buck v. Beach, 206
U. S.392.
If the property cannot be taxed specifically because
outside the State, it cannot be reached indirectly, as by
a general tax on the capital stock or property of a domestic
corporation which would include the property outside the
State.
In such cases the tax is void as to so much of the company's property as is situated outside the State. Del.,
Lack. & West. Ry. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U. S.341; Louisville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U. S.385; West. Un. Tel.

American economists agree that the attempt to tax
shares of stock in foreign corporations upon their market
value is unjust, unwise, and ineffective. See reports for
1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912 of the National
and International Conferences on State and Local Taxation. Report of Wisconsin Tax Commission for 1910;
Report in 1897 of Special Commission on Taxation in
Massachusetts.
Mr. H. L. Boutwell for defendant in error:
The Massachusetts acts authorizing the levying of a
tax by a municipal corporation upon shares of the stock of
foreign corporations owned by its inhabitants domiciled
therein are not contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.
This form of taxation has existed under the laws of
Massachusetts for more than seventy years. See the
earlier enactment, in Rev. 'Stat., c. 7, § 4, the validity and
constitutionality of which were sustained in Great Barrington v. Commissioners, 16 Pick. 572; Dwight v. Boston, 12
Allen, 316; Frothingham v. Shaw, 175 Massachusetts, 59,
61; Hawley v. Malden, 204 Massachusetts, 138.

v. Indiana, 226 U. S. 390.
Unless constrained by the most cogent reasons this
court ought not to overturn a system of taxation which
has been practiced for so many years and repeatedly upheld by the courts of so many different States. As to
Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194, see correct
rule stated in Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U. S.

For the purposes of taxation, personal property may
be separated from the owner, and he may be taxed on its
account at the place where it is actually located.
In order to obtain a taxable situs in a jurisdiction other
than that of the domicile of its owner tangible personal
property must hav6 become commingled or intermingled
with the property of the taxing authority or permanently
located there or incorporated in the local property of such
other jurisdiction. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia,

The tendency of modern authorities is to apply the

property may be taxed at the domicile of the owner as
the real situs of the debt, and also, more particularly in the
case of mortgages, in the State where the property is retained. Tappan v. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall.

MR. JusTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error, a resident of the city of Malden,
brought this action to recover the amount of certain taxes
which he had paid under protest, The taxes were assessed
upon shares which he held in foreign corporations most of
which did no business and had no property within the
State of Massachusetts. It was alleged that the levy and
collection were in violation of the due process and equal
protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the Superior
Court and the case was reported to the Supreme Judicial
Court of the Commonwealth which directed judgment
for the defendant. 204 Massachusetts, 138.
It is conceded that the objection that the statute authorizing the tax [Rev. Laws (Mass.), c. 12, §§ 2, 4, 23]
denies to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the

HAWLEY v. MALDEN.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

laws is not well taken; but it is contended that the shares
were not within the jurisdiction of the State and hence
that the enforcement of the tax constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of property.
The power thus challenged, as the state court points
out, has been continuously exercised by the State of Massachusetts for more than three-quarters of a century.
Substantially the same statutory provision, derived from
an earlier enactment, is found in Rev. Stats. (Mass.), c. 7,
§ 4, and its constitutionality has been sustained by repeated state decisions. Great Barringtonv. County Commissioners, 16 Pick. 572; Dwight v. Mayor & Aldermen of
Boston, 12 Allen, 316; Frothingham v. Shaw, 175 Massachiusetts, 59, 61. And other States through a long period
of years have asserted a similar authority. Union Bank of

Greenleaf v. Morgan County, 184 Illinois, 226. It is well
settled that the property of the shareholders in their respective shares is distinct from the corporate property,
franchises and capital stock, and may be separately taxed
(Van Allen v.. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 584; Farringtonv.
Tennessee, 95 U. S.679, 687; Tennessee v. Whitworth, 117
U. S. 129, 136, 137; New Orleans v. Houston, 119 U. S.
265, 277); and the rulings in the state cases which we have

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

cited proceed upon the view that shares are personal property and, having no situs elsewhere, are taxable by the
State of the owner's domicile, whether the corporations
be foreign or domestic.
It is said that the question of the constitutional validity
of such taxation has not hitherto been raised definitely
in this court and has not been directly passed upon. There
is no doubt, however, that the existence of the state authority has invariably been assumed. In Sturges v. Carter, 114 U. S. 511, the action was brought to recover taxes
imposed under the law of Ohio upon shares of stock owned
by a resident of Ohio in the Western Union Telegraph
Company, a New York corporation. The right of the
State to tax the shares was not questioned and as it was
found that a statutory exemption which was relied upon
in defense did not apply, the recovery of the tax was sustained. Again, in Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, it was
not disputed that the State was entitled to tax shares
owned by its citizens in foreign corporations. The argument was that the statute in that case created an unconstitutional discrimination and, this point being found to'
be without merit, the tax was upheld. In Wright v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 195 U. S. 219, the question was
whether shares of stock in a railroad corporation of an,other State, which were owned by a Georgia corporation
were taxable under the constitution and laws of Georgia.
The State's power to tax the shares was not denied, so
far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned,
but it was contended that this power had not been exercised. The constitution of Georgia provided that all
taxation should "be uniform upon the same class of subjects, ant ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed
within the territorial .limits of the authority levying the
tax," and should be levied and collected under general
laws. The general tax act had authorized a tax on all of
the ,taxable property of the State. It was clear that the

HAWLEY v. MALDEN.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

State had directed shares in foreign corporations to be
taxed, provided these could be considered to be "property
subject to be taxed within the territorial limits" of the
taxing authority. And such shares when held by a resident being deemed to fall within this description, it was
decided that the state officer was entitled to collect the
tax. "Putting the case at-the lowest," said the court
(p. 222), "the above cited section of the constitution was
adopted in the interest of the State as a tax collector,
and authorizes, if it does not require, a tax on the stock."
So also, in Darnell v. Indiana,226 U. S. 390, the authority
of the State to tax the shares of its citizens in foreign corporations was recognized, the tax being sustained against
objections urged under the commerce clause, Art. I, § 8,
and the equal Drotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
To support the contention that this familiar state action,
hitherto assumed to be valid, is fundamentally violative
of the Federal Constitution, the plaintiff in error invokes
the doctrine that a State has no right to tax the property
of its citizens when it is permanently located in another
jurisdiction. Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U. S. 385; Del., Lack. & West. R. R. Co. v.
Pennsylvania, 198 U. S. 341; Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194. But these decisions did not involve
the question of the taxation of intangible personal property (Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. p. 211);
nor do they apply to tangible personal property which, although physically outside the State of the owner's domicile, has not acquired an actual situs elsewhere. Southern
Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U. S. 63, 68. When we are
dealing with the intangible interest of the shareholder,
there is manifestly no question of physical situs, so far as
this distinct property right is concerned, and the jurisdiction to tax it is not dependent upon the location of the
lands and chattels of the corporation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

The argument, necessarily, is that shares are to be
deemed to be taxable solely in the State of ircorporation.
It is urged that these rights rest in franchise and that the
principle of the decision in Louisville &c. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, supra, holding that a ferry franchise granted by
Indiana to a Kentucky corporation was not taxable in
Kentucky is applicable to shares of stock. But that case
went upon the ground that the franchise was an incorporeal hereditament and hence had its legal situs in Indiana, 188 U. S. p. 398. Shares fall within a different category. While the shareholder's rights are those of a member
of the corporation entitled to have the corporate enterprise conducted in accordance with its charter, they are
still in the nature of contract rights or choses in action.
Morawetz on Corporations, § 225. As such, in the absence
of legislation prescribing a different rule, they are appropriately related to the person of the owner, and, being held
by him at his domicile, constitute property with respect
to which he is under obligation to contribute to the support of the government whose protection he enjoys. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491; Bonaparte v. Tax Court,
104 U. S. 592; Covington v. FirstNational Bank, 198 U. S.
100, 111, 112; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra;
Cooley on Taxation (3d ed.), 26.
Undoubtedly, the State in which a corporation is organized may provide, in creating it, for the taxation in
that State of all its shares whether owned by residents or
non-residents. Corry v. Baltimore, 196 U. S. 466. This
is by virtue of the authority of the creating State to determine the basis of organization and the liabilities of
shareholders. Id., 476, 477; Hannis DistilleryCo. v. Baltimore, 216 U. S. 285, 293, 294. So, by reason of its dominant power to provide for the organization and conduct
of national banks, Congress has fixed the places at which
alone shares in those institutions may be taxed. Rev.
Stat., § 5219. Whether, in the case of corporations or-

HAWLEY v. MALDEN.

Opinion of the Court.

ganized under state laws, a provision by the State of incorporation fixing the situs of shares for the purpose of taxation, by whomever owned, would exclude the taxation of
the shares by other States in which their owners reside is
a question which does not arise upon this record and need
not be decided. No such provision is here involved, and
the present case must be determined by the application of
the established principle which has been stated.
The real ground of complaint in this class of cases is not
that the shares are taxed in one place rather than in another but that they are taxed at all, when presumably the
property and franchises of the corporation which give to
the shares their value are also taxed. As to this we may
repeat what was said in Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730,
732, "No doubt it would be a great advantage to the
country and to the individual States if principles of taxation could be agreed upon which did not conflict with each
other, and a common scheme could be adopted by which
taxation of substantially the same property in two jurisdictions could be avoided. But the Constitution of the
United States does not go so far."
The judgment is affirmed.

Affirmed.
