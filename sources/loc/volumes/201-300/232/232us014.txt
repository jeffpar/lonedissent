BARRETT, PRESIDENT OF ADAMS EXPRESS CO.,
v. CITY OF NEW YORK.
CITY OF NEW YORK v. BARRETT, PRESIDENT OF
ADAMS EXPRESS CO.
APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK.
Nos. 83, 84.

Argued December 3, 4, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

The practical construction of municipal ordinances by the local authorities prior to the controversy is persuasive, especially where, as in
this case, a different construction would render the ordinances unconstitutional.
While the exertion of the police power essential for protection of the
community may extend incidentally to operations of interstate commerce, the police power does not justify the imposition of direct burdens on that commerce nor its subjection to unreasonable demands.
A state law is unconstitutional and void which requires a party to take
out a license for carrying on interstate commerce, no matter how
specious the pretext may be for imposing it. Crutcher v. Kentucky,
141 U. S. 47.
An ordinance requiring an express company to take out local licenses
for transacting interstate business is an unconstitutional burden on
interstate commerce.
Congress has exercised its authority over interstate express business
and so removed that business from any action of the State directly
burdening it.
A municipal license fee required for express wagons and drivers cannot
be construed as a fee or tax for use of the streets or regulation of
street traffic; and quwre whether the ordinance in this case, if so
construed, would not be invalid as discriminating against express
companies.
While regulations to insure careful driving over city streets may be
proper, they should, when interstate traffic is involved, be entirely
reasonable. Qucrre whether a requirement that only citizens of the
United States, or those who have declared their intention to become

ADAMS EXPRESS CO. v. NEW YORK.

Argument for the Adams Express Company.

such, can be licensed is not unnecessarily burdensome in a city such
as New York.
Where a license tax is declared unconstitutional as to all classes covered
by the action it is not necessary for this court to decide whether it
has been superseded as to one of the classes by. a later statute;
qucrre whether the general automobile statute of New York State
repealed and superseded the express license fee ordinance of the
City of New York.
The ordinances of the City of New York requiring expressmen to be
licensed and providing that only citizens of the United States or
those who have declared their intention to become such can be
licensed, as applied to interstate commerce, impose a direct burden
thereon and, as so applied, are unconstitutional under the commerce
clause of the Constitution of the United States.
Where a municipal'ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to interstate commerce, the person or corporation whose business is impeded
by the enforcement of such ordinance is entitled to an injunction
restraining the municipal authorities from enforcing it in respect to
its interstate business.
189 Fed. Rep. 268, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
commerce clause of the Federal Constitution of certain
ordinances of the City of New York as applied to the interstate business of express companies, are stated in the

opinion.
Mr. William D. Guthrie for Adams Express Company:
The ordinance is unconstitutional and void as to the

interstate express companies because it requires them to
take out a license, pay license fees and give bonds for the

privilege of carrying on interstate business.

The service rendered by the drivers and wagons of the
Adams Express Company in collecting and delivering
packages in the City of New York is an inseparable part
of interstate commerce. The local transportation ,of interstate packages is interstate commerce, and so within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government.

The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution
guarantees the right to ship merchandise from one State
into another, and covers and protects the shipment from
the time it commences its transit by whatever means, local
or interstate, until the termination of the shipment by
delivery at the place of consignment. The Daniel Ball, 10

People ex rel. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Knight, 171

The ordinance shows on its face that its intent and purpose were to regulate business and nothing else, and that
it could not have been intended as a regulation of the use
of the streets of the City of New York. Detroit v. Little,
163 Michigan, 444, 448.
Until a few years ago, not a single wagon or driver of
the company was licensed, and never until then was any
demand or intimation made by any city official that the
company must procure licenses for them. This long continued administrative or executive construction of such
an ordinance cannot be ignored. Easton v. Pickersgill, 55

The Charter of the City by § 57 provides for an annual
compilation of the ordinances by the board of aldermen.
The reenactment, without change, of a statute which had
previously received long continued executive construction, is an adoption of such construction. United States v.
Hermanos, 209 U. S. 337; Copper Mining Co. v. Arizona
Board, 206 U. S. 474, 479; United States v. Falk, 204 U. S.
143, 152; New Haven R. R. v. Interstate Com. Comm., 200
U. S. 361, 401. The same principle applies to the adoption
by a municipal legislature of the executive construction
of an ordinance by repeatedly reenacting it substantially
in the form in which it was construed. Outwaterv. Green,

so as to make it read as if its operation were expressly
limited to the wagons and drivers of the interstate carriers
who are engaged in local business, and thus compel such
carriers at prohibitive expense and inconvenience to separate the local from the interstate business. Williams v.

If the ordinance in question had been expressly drawn

it would nevertheless be invalid.

the use of the streets by any class of the public having

Undoubtedly, under the police power and in the absence
of action and regulation by Congress, the several States
have ample power to enact reasonable police regulations
and legal sanctions which indirectly affect interstate
commerce. See Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465; Nashville
&c. R. Co. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96; West. Un. Tel. Co.
v. James, 162 U. S. 650; Chicago &c. R. Co. v. Solan, 169

220 U. S. 364.
In each of these cases, however, the provision in question related either to a subject not yet covered by any
legislation of Congress, or created a sanction to secure the
performance of the legal duties of common carriers. Many
of these regulations belonged to that large class which
are superseded as soon as Congress asserts its right to
exercise exclusive power and to introduce uniform regulations. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491, 500;

Mr. Walker D. Hines for the United States Express
Company in Nos. 85 and 86, argued simultaneously herewith: 1
There was no basis for separation because the various
specific provisions upheld below cannot be regarded as
regulations as to the usd of the streets.
The various specific provisions upheld below, even if
they could be regarded as regulations as to the use of the
streets, are not separable from the remainder of the ordinance.
But the license provisions are an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce even if relating to the use
of the streets and capable of separation.
The reasonableness of the regulation is a question for the
court and the inquiry is broader under the commerce clause
than under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The relation to any local police necessity is so remote
and fanciful, and the interference with interstate commerce so direct and burdensome, that the regulations are
unreasonable as to interstate commerce.
The regulations apply to a very small part of the vehicles
using the streets, and this, under the facts of this case,
establishes unreasonableness as to interstate commerce.
The Mayor's power to revoke licenses -creates under the
peculiar circumstances here an unreasonable burden upon
interstate commerce.
The requirement of a bond for prompt delivery of interstate shipments is an unconstitutional interference with
interstate commerce.

The ordinances are a valid exercise of the police power

subject, Covington Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 154 U. S. 204;
West. Un. Tel. Co. v. James, 162 U. S. 650, whenever
the subject of the regulation is of a local nature, and
only incidentally affects interstate commerce, it is within
the legislative power of the State, in the absence of conflicting national regulation of the same subject. Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist., 120 U. S. 489, 492;

merce. See §§ 300, 379, c. 7, Code of Ordinances of the
City of New York (Cosby's).
The license fees of $5 for each express wagon and of
fifty cents for each driver thereof, therefore, are merely
the necessary sums reasonably fixed to cover the ordinary and usual expenses of administration, supervision
and inspection; and, as such, are sums collected in aid
of the exercise of the police powers and are not an exercise of the taxing power. The distinction between licenses, and fees in connection therewith, exacted in the
exercise of the police power, and license taxes, levied under
the taxing power, has long been recognized. West Un.

This suit was brought to restrain the enforcement
against the Adams Express Company of a group of ordinances of the Board of Aldermen of the City of New
York upon the ground that, as applied to that Company,
these ordinances constitute an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce and deny to it the equal
protection of the laws. The ordinances are contained in

York for pay" is to be deemed a public express (§330).
It is to bear a designation accordingly with its official
number (§331). Its owner is to give a bond to the State
for "every vehicle licensed in a penal sum of $100, with
sufficient surety, approved by the Mayor or Chief of the
Bureau of Licenses, conditioned for the safe and prompt

delivery" of all articles (§332). Provision is also made for
the regular inspection of "all licensed vehicles and places
of business" (§374), the report of any change of residence
to the Bureau of Licenses (id.), the exhibition of licenses upon demand (§ 375), and the display of the prescribed letters and numbers (§376). Penalties are provided for the violation of these requirements, and any
person carrying on any business regulated by the ordinance, without license, is guilty of a misdemeanor (§§ 307,
315, 379).
The Adams Express Company; an unincorporated
association organized under the laws of New York, has
been engaged in interstate commerce, as a common carrier
of packages, since the year 1854. It transacts its business
in many States; and in the City of New York it handles
daily about 50,000 interstate shipments, employing 341
wagons and 68 automobiles. About one-half of these
wagons are stabled in Jersey City. Its shipments from
New York City to the south and west are hauled to
Jersey City and there loaded on express cars of the Pennsylvania Railroad; those destined to points east are taken
to the terminal in New York City of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad; and there is also traffic
for points on the New York, Ontario and Western Railroad,
and tributary thereto, which is carried to the terminal
of that road at Weehawken, New Jersey. Shipments
received from out of thd State for delivery in New York
City are taken by the Company's vehicles to the consignees
either directly from these railroad terminals or through
intermediate distributing offices. The Company also

Opinion of the Court.

does a local business in the City of New York and, in
addition, receives packages for transportation between
that city and such points within the State of New York
as are on the line of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad. The interstate business, however,
in the number of packages, comprises ninety-eight per
cent. of the total business transacted in New York City,
and, it being impracticable to effect a separation, the local
and the other intrastate shipments are handled in the
same vehicles, and by the same men, that are employed
in connection with the interstate transportation. It was
not until recently that the City sought to compel the Company, in the transaction of this business, to comply with
its license ordinances, although there have been ordinances requiring licenses for both express wagons and their
drivers for over fifty years (Kent's ed. (1856); Valentine's
ed. (1859), pp. 374, 375; Shepard & Shafer's ed. (1881),
§§ 380-386; Laird's ed. (1894), §§ 380-386; Percy &
Collins' ed., §§ 497-504). The provisions here involved
(except § 315) received their present form in 1899. (Ord.
app. May 22, 1899, ante, p, 25, note.) It is conceded that
the Company has never been compelled to obtain a license for the conduct of its interstate express business,
and that its wagons and drivers employed therein have
never been licensed, except "that for several years last
past about 40 licenses for wagons and drivers have been
taken out." The evidence shows that in 1908 an arrangement was made, by way of compromise, that the forty
licenses should be issued (twenty having been taken out
the year before). The Company agreed to this number,
without prejudice, asserting that it was larger in proportion to the total number of wagons than the local business
warranted and also that the latter was merely incidental
to the interstate business and hence not subject to the
license requirements. In the fall of 1910, however, at a
time when the business of the Company was interrupted

232 U. S.

by a strike of its drivers, and it was endeavoring to replace
those who had stopped work, the City through its officers
undertook to enforce the ordinances with respect to all
the wagons and drivers of the Company, threatening
to arrest unlicensed drivers of unlicensed wagons notwithstanding they might be engaged in interstate transportation and to remove, if necessary, unlicensed wagons
from the streets. This was the occasion of the present
suit.
The Circuit Court held that §§ 305 and 306 were inoperative so far as they purported to require the complainant to obtain a local license for transacting its interstate business, and further that the requirement of
licenses as to express automobiles, and chauffeurs, had
been superseded by a state statute (Laws of 1910, c. 374).
To this extent the City, and its officers who were codefendants, were enjoined. But with respect to the payment
of license fees for express wagons and drivers, and the
other regulations which we have briefly described, the
court held that the enactments were valid and an injunction was refused. 189 Fed. Rep. 268. Both parties appeal,
the Company insisting that it was entitled to the entire
relief sought, and the City, that no relief whatever should
have been granted.
In restraining the enforcement of §§ 305 and 306, as
stated, we think that the court was right. In the absence
of a controlling state decision construing the group of ordinances in question and the statute authorizing the City
to license businesses (Greater New York Charter, § 51),
we are not satisfied that they were designed, despite the
broad definition contained in § 330, to apply to interstate
business. The practical construction which they received
before the present controversy arose is very persuasive
to the contrary (City of New York v. New York City Ry.
7o., 193 N. Y. 543, 549; United States v. Hermanos, 209
U. S. 337, 339). But, if the above-mentioned sections are

ADAMS EXPRESS CO. v. NEW YORK.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to be deemed to require that a license must be obtained
as a condition precedent to conducting the interstate business of an express company, we are of the opinion that so
construed they would be clearly unconstitutional. It
is insisted that, under the authority of the State, the ordinances were adopted in the exercise of the police power.
But that does not justify the imposition of a direct burden
upon interstate commerce. Undoubtedly, the exertion
of the power essential to assure needed protection to the
community may extend incidentally to the operations of a
carrier in its interstate business, provided it does not
subject that business to unreasonable demands and is not
opposed to Federal legislation. Smith v. Alaoama, 124
U. S.465; Hennington v. Georgia, 163 U. S. 299; N. Y.,
N. H. & H. R. R. Co. v. New York, 165 U. S. 628; Lake
Shore & M. S. Ry. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285. It must,
however, be confined to matters which are appropriately
of local concern. It must proceed upon the recognition
of the right secured by the Federal Constitution. Local
police regulations cannot go so far as to deny the right
to engage in interstate commerce, or to treat it as a local
privilege and prohibit its exercise in the absence of a local
license. Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 58; Robbins
v. Shelby County Taxing District, 120 U. S. 489, 496;
Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, 645; Stoutenburgh v.
Hennick, 129 U. S. 141, 148; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, 203
U. S. 507; International Text Book Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S.
91, 109; Oklahoma v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S.

Crenshaw v. Arkansas, 227 U. S. 389; Minnesota Rate
Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 401. As was said by this court in
Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. p. 58, "a state law is
unconstitutional and void which requires a party to take
out a license for carrying on interstate commerce, no matter how specious the pretext may be for imposing it."
The requirements of §§ 305 and 306, with the schedule

232 U. S.

of fees in § 308, cannot be regarded as imposing a fee, or
tax, for the use of the streets; if they were such, the question would at once arise as to the validity of the discrimination involved in such an exaction. Nor can they be
considered as a regulation in the interest of safety in street
traffic. Other ordinances provide for the "rules of the
road" to which wagons of express companies, as well as
those of other persons, are subject (Code of Ordinances,
chap. 12). The sections now under consideration constitute a regulation of the express "business." Article I
is entitled "Business Requiring a License"; § 305, containing the enumeration, provides that "the following
businesseg must be duly licensed" and § 306, that" no person shall engage in or carry on any such business without
a license therefor" under a stated penalty (ante, p. 24,
note). The right of public control, in requiring such a
license, is asserted by virtue of the. character of the employment, but while such a requirement may be proper
in the case of local or intrastate business, it cannot be
justified as a prerequisite to the cohduct of the business
thatA is interstate. Not only is the latter protected from
the action of the State, either directly or through its
municipalities, in laying direct burdens upon it, but, in
the present instance, Congress has exercised its authority
and has provided its own scheme of regulation in order
to secure the discharge of the public obligations that the
business involves. Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat.
584; Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491, 505;
United States v. Adams Express Co., 229 U. S. 381.
It would seem to follow, necessarily, that the annual
license fees prescribed by § 308. (ante, p. 25, note) cannot
be exacted, so far as the interstate business is concerned.
They cannot be regarded as coming within the category
of inspection fees, which are sustained when fairly commensurate with the cost of local supervision of such matters
as are under local control (Western -Union Tel. Co. v.

ADAMS EXPRESS CO. v. NEW YORK.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

New Hope, 187 U. S. 419, 425; Atlantic &c. Tel. Co. v.
Philadelphia,190 U. S. 160, 164). The provisions of § 308
are inseparably connected with those of §§ 305 and 306.
The sums fixed "for each express wagon" and "for each
driver" measure the amount to be exacted for the granting
of the license required for the carrying on of business.
And it is difficult to see how the payment can be enforced
as to the interstate business if the taking out of the license therefor cannot be compelled.
Similar considerations are controlling with respect to
the provision of § 332 for the giving of license bonds.
This in terms is related to the requirement of § 305. It is
provided that a bond shall be given "for each and every
vehicle licensed" and it is to be conditioned "for the safe
and prompt delivery of all baggage, packages," etc.,
entrusted to the owner or driver "of any such licensed
express." As applied to the Company's business of interstate transportation, it must fall with the provision
regarding the license, and, further, it must be regarded
as repugnant to the exclusive control asserted by Congress
in occupying the field of regulation with regard to the
obligations to be assumed by interstate express carriers.
(Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, supra; Southern Ry.
Co. v. Reid, 222 U. S. 424; Same v. Reid & Ream, id., 444,
447.)
Section 315 provides for separate licenses for drivers.
We may assume the propriety of suitable provision to
ensure careful driving over the city streets and the existence of ample power to meet this local necessity. It is
also clear that regulations for this purpose, when the
movement of interstate traffic is involved, should be entirely reasonable and should not arbitrarily restrict the
facilities upon which it must depend. If the provision of
§ 315 could be regarded as severable from the requirement
of a license for the conduct of business, we should still
have great difficulty in sustaining it as a reasonable reguVOL. ccxxxII-3

lation with regard to drivers employed in the interstate
transportation which has been described.
Reading
§ 315 in connection with § 307, as we understand the City
contends it should be read, no driver can be licensed
except a citizen of the United States or one who has regularly declared intention to become a citizen, and the
assurance of his qualifications does not depend simply
upon the applicant's ability to meet appropriate tests
so as to satisfy the official judgment but the application
must be accompanied by the indorsement in writing of
two reputable residents of the city testifying to his competence. When the importance to the entire country
of promptness and facility in the conduct of the business
of the express companies in New York City, and the
obvious convenience of their being able to secure drivers
in Jersey City as well as in New York, are considered, the
provision would seem to be unnecessarily burdensome.
We are not called upon, however, to decide this point.
Section 315 relates exclusively to drivers of a "licensed
hack or express." There is no such provision as to drivers'
of wagons generally. While the drivers license is separate,
the ordinance refers only to such drivers as are employed
in the business for the carrying on of which a license may
be required. Whatever might otherwise be the City's
power as to the regulation of drivers, this provision cannot be divorced from the license scheme of which it is a
part.
Other requirements, such as the marking of the vehicles
with their official numbers, the exhibition of licenses upon
demand, and the inspection of "licensed vehicles and places
of business" have obvious reference to the same license
plan.
We conclude that the complainant was entitled to an
injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinances
in question against the Company with respect to the conduct of its interstate business and its wagons and drivers

superseded, as to automobiles, by the state statute.

is remanded to the District Court with direction to enter
