LAPINA v. WILLIAMS, COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 7.

Submitted December 1, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

The authority of Congress over the admission of aliens to the United
States is plenary.
Congress may exclude aliens altogether, or it may prescribe the terms
and conditions upon which they may come into or remain in this
country.
The provisions of the Immigration Act of 1907 respecting admission
and deportation apply to an alien who, having remained in this
country for more than three years after first entry, and having gone
abroad for a temporary purpose with the intention of returning,
again seeks and gains admittance to the United States.
The immigration acts of 1903 and 1907 were revisions or compilations
with some modifications of previous acts pertaining to the same
subject, and those acts having confined the exclusion and deportation
provisions to "alien immigrants" and that term having been construed as not including aliens once admitted and returning after
temporary absence, the omission of the word "immigrant" and
application of those provisions to "aliens" will be construed as
indicating an intention to extend the act to all aliens, whether entering for the first time or returning after a temporary absence.
Debates in Congress are unreliable as a source from which to discover
the meaning of the language employed in an act, and this court is
not disposed to go beyond the reports of the committees.
It is only in a doubtful case that the title of an act can control the
meaning of the enacting clauses, and so held, that the use of the word
"immigration" in the title of the act of 1907 cannot overcome the
fact as evidenced by the act itself that Congress intended its provisions to apply to all aliens and not exclusively to alien immigrants.
Taylor v. United States, 207 U. S. 120, distinguished.
179 Fed. Rep. 839, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the deportation provisions of
the Alien Immigration Act of 1907, are stated in the
opinion.

232 U. 9.

Argument for Petitioner.

Mr. William Hawkins for petitioner:
The majority of the Circuit Courts of Appeals are in
petitioner's favor,-four as against two. For those
against petitioner's contention, see Ex parte Hoffman,
179 Fed. Rep. 839; Taylor v. United States, 152 Fed. Rep.
1; reversed, 207 U. S. 120; United States v. Sprung, 187
Fed. Rep. 905. In favor of petitioner's contention, see
Rodgers v. United States, 152 Fed. Rep. 346; and see also
191 Fed. Rep. 979; Redfern v. Halpert, 186 Fed. Rep. 151;
United States v. Aultman, 148 Fed. Rep. 1022; United
States v. Nakashima, 160 Fed. Rep. 842. And see also
District Court cases, Re Petterson, 166 Fed. Rep. 536;
Re White, 166 Fed. Rep. 1007; Re Kleibs, 128 Fed. Rep.
656; Re Funaro, 164 Fed. Rep. 152; Re Crawford, 165
Fed. Rep. 830.
The petitioner, in the eye of the law, was a domiciled
alien resident, and therefore not within the scope of the
Immigration Act of 1907.
She did not put herself in motion to quit the country,
sine animo revertendi. The Venus, 8 Cranch, 280.
Domicile is largely a matter of intention. See McCrary on Elections, Appx., 2d ed., 449, 561.
A man may acquire a domicile or residence if he be
personally present in a place and elect that as his home.
Behrensmeyer v. Kreitz, 135 Illinois, 591; Cobb v. Smith,
88 Illinois, 201; Wilson v. Marshall, 80 Illinois, 78.
In the Western States where petitioner lived there is no
distinction between resident aliens and citizens except as
to voting and holding public office. State v. Fowler, 41
La. Ann. 380.
The words "aliens" and "alien" as used in the immigration statutes existing prior to 1903 and 1907, were both
construed uniformly by the Federal courts as referring
to "alien immigrants" exclusively. Moffitt v. United
States, 128 Fed. Rep. 375; United States v. Burke, 99 Fed.
Rep. 895.

Argument for Petitioner.

232 U. S.

Under the 1891 act a person in circumstances similar
to the one at bar did not come within the scope of the
immigration statutes. Re Panzara; 51 Fed. Rep. 275;
Re Martorelli, 63 Fed. Rep, 437; Re Maiola, 67 Fed. Rep.
114.
The use of the word "aliens" in acts of 1903 and 1907,
instead of "alien immigrants," does not indicate any
intention on the part of Congress to make the statutes of
1903 and 1907 apply to an alien statused as in the case at
bar. United States v. Dauphin, 20 Fed. Rep. 628; Goodell
v. Jackson, 20 Johns. 722; Taylor v. Delancey, 2 Caine's
Cases, 151; Dominick v. Michael, 4 Sandf. 409.
Where the language of a statute is ambiguous or otherwise doubtful; or, being plain, a literal construction would
lead to such absurdity, hardship or injustice, as to render
it irrational to impute to the law-making power a purpose
to produce or permit such result, the title may be resorted
to as tending to throw light upon the legislative intent of
its scope or operation. United States v. Fisher,2 Cranch,
386; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U. S. 462;
Coosaw Mining Co. v. South Carolina, 144 U. S. 563;
Binns v. United States, 194 U. S. 486.

The Government's present contention is negatived by
the statistical rules issued by the government department. See government print dated 1908,-approved by
Secretary Straus, June 22, 1907, Rule 30.

time the 1907 act was enacted,-and long afterwards.
The Department's own written response to Congress
proves this. See 60th Cong., 2d Sess., H. R. Doc. No.
1494, Letter of Feb. 25, 1909, from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor transmitting a response to the inquiry
of the House as to admission of aliens into the United
States. See United States v. Ala. R. R. Co., 142 U. S.
621.
The words "alien" and "aliens" and "passengers"
had been used in four previous immigration statutes
as meaning "immigrant." Re Lea, 126 Fed. Rep. 233.
If a domiciled alien who has taken out his first papers
goes abroad and is subjected to pains by a government
other than that of his origin, the United States Ambassadors have been held justified, on proper showing,
to interfere on behalf of such inchoate citizen. See
Foreign Relations of U. S., 1884, p. 552.
Penal statutes are to be strictly construed. The rule is
founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of the
individual. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 95;
Hackfeld v. United States, 197 U. S. 442; Canfara v.
Williams, 186 Fed. Rep. 354.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denisonand Mr. Francis
H. McAdoo for respondent:
For an earlier case on this question see Bugajewitz v.
Adams, 228 U. S. 585.
The word "alien" as used in. the later immigration
statutes does not mean "alien immigrant," but is intended to cover any "alien" entering the country, whether
or not previously here.
Neither in the section itself nor elsewhere does the act
place any restriction on the word "alien."
The. elimination by Congress of the word "immigrant"
throughout the act was a positive indication of an intention to withdraw the restriction on the word "alien"

The administrative construction supports the construction given by the court below.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
The petitioner, an unmarried woman and a native of
Russia, came to the United States in the year 1897 or
1898, at the age of about twelve years, accompanied by

Opinion of the Court.

a man who had promised to marry her, and during the
four years immediately following she practiced prostitution in the City of New York and supported her companion with the proceeds of her prostitution; she then
left that city, and thereafter continuously practiced prostitution in various parts of the United States, including
different towns and cities in the States of Washington,
Arizona, and Texas. In the month of March, 1908, she
returned to Russia for the purpose of visiting her mother,
intending at the same time to return to this country;
she reentered the United States at the port of New York
in June, 1908, accompanied by her mother, at which time
petitioner falsely represented, for the purpose of facilitating her landing, that she was Mrs. Joseph Fiore, and the
wife of an American citizen; at the time of this, her second
entry, she intended to continue the practice of prostitution in the United States, and almost immediately upon
being admitted she engaged in that practice, and was
continually engaged in it until September 21, 1909, on
which date she was arrested in a house of prostitution in
Phoenix, Arizona, upon a warrant of arrest duly issued
by the Acting Secretary of Commerce and Labor under
the provisions of the Immigration Act of February 20,
1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898. Upon a hearing properly
accorded to her, the foregoing facts were established, and
an order of deportation was made upon the ground that
she was a prostitute and was such at the time of her
entry into the United States; that she entered the United
States for the purpose of prostitution; and that she had
been found an inmate of a house of prostitution and
practicing the same within three years after her entry.
She obtained a writ of habeas corpus, which, after a hearing,
was dismissed by the District Court for the Southern
District of New York. Upon appeal, the Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed the order of dismissal (sub nom. Ex
parte Hoffman, 179 Fed. Rep. 839). The present writ of cer-

tiorari was then allowed because of the division of judicial
opinion upon the question presented, which is whether
the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1907 respecting
admission and deportation apply to an alien such as
the petitioner, who, having remained in this country for
more than three years (in this instance for more than ten
years), after first entry, and having gone abroad for a
temporary purpose and with the intention of returning,
again seeks and gains admittance into the United States.
The pertinent provisions of the act of 1907 are set forth
in the margin.' So far as the present question is concerned, the act is not materially different from-certainly
not less stringent than-the act of March 3, 1903 (32
Stat. 1213, c. 1012). The Circuit Court of Appeals in the
present case followed its own decision in Taylor v. United
States, 152 Fed. Rep. 1, which was based upon the act of
1 SEC. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from
admission into the United States: . . . prostitutes, or women or
girls coming into the United States for the purpose of prostitution or for
any other immoral purlose; . . . 34 Stat. 898.
SEC. 3.
.
. any alien woman or girl who shall be found an inmate of a house of prostitution or practicing prostitution, at any time
within three years after she shall have entered the United States, shall
be deemed t6 be unlawfully within the United States and shall be deported as provided by sections twenty and twenty-one of this Act. 34
Stat. 899.
SEC. 20. That any alien who shall enter the United States inviolation
of law, . . . shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, be taken into custody and deported to the country
whence he came at any time within three years after the date of his
entry into the United States. 34 Stat. 904.
SEc. 21. That in case the Secretary of Commerce and Labor shall be
satisfied that an alien has been found in the United States in violation
of this Act, or that an alien is subject to deportation under the provisions of this Act or of any law of the United States, he shall cause such
alien within the period of three years after landing or entry therein to
be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came, as
provided by section twenty of this Act,

1903, and in which it was held that while the provisions
of the act of March 3,1891 (26 Stat. 1084, c. 551) had be-n
construed as restricted to "alien immigrants," the act of
1903 had been so framed as to cover aliens whether immigrants or not. In behalf of the petitioner it is contended
that the court erred in its judgment as to the purpose of
Congress in modifying the language of previous acts on
adopting the revision of 1903, and that this act and the
act of 1907, as well as those that preceded them, when
properly construed, refer to "alien immigrants" exclusively.
The acts of 1903 and 1907 being revisions or compilations (with some modifications) of previous acts pertaining
to the same general subject-matter, a reference list, in
chronological order, is for convenience set forth in the

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

In a number of cases in the Federal District and Circuit
Courts, it was held that the provisions of the act of
March 3, 1891, and the acts that preceded it, relating to
the exclusion and deportation of persons arriving in the
United States from foreign countries, were confined in
their operation to "alien immigrants"; and that this term
did not include aliens previously resident in this country,
who had temporarily departed with the intention of returning. In re Panzara (1892), 51 Fed. Rep. 275; In re
Martorelli (1894), 63 Fed. Rep. 437; In re Maiola (1895),
67 Fed. Rep. 114; In re Ota (1899), 96 Fed. Rep. 487.
The same view was expressed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Moffitt v. United States
(1904), 128 Fed. Rep. 375.
Upon the reasoning and authority of these cases, a
similar construction was given to the act of 1903 in United
States v. Aultman Co. (1906), 143 Fed. Rep- 922 (affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 148 Fed. Rep. 1022), the
attention of the court apparently not having been directed
to the question whether any significant change had been
made in the law by the revision of 1903.
But in Taylor v. United States (1907), 152 Fed. Rep. 1,
which was a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit of a judgment of conviction upon an
indictment for a misdemeanor for permitting an alien
sailor to land in New York, contrary to § 18 of the act of
"An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses," etc.,
approved August 18, 1894, containing clauses amending immigration
laws, 28 Stat. 372, 390, 391, e. 301.
"An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States,"
approved March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1213, c. 1012.
"An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United
States," approved February 20, 1907, 34 Stat. 898, c. 1134.
"An act to amend an act entitled 'An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States,' approved February twentieth,
nineteen hundred and seven," approved March 26, 1910, 36 Stat. 263,
c. 128.

Opinion of the C6urt.

1903, which made it the duty of the owners, officers, and
agents of any vessel bringing an alien to the United States
to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of any
such alien, etc., the court reviewed the changes made by
Congress in the revision of 1903, "following decisions of
the courts which tended to relax the provisions of earlier
acts," and, finding that § 18 of the act of 1903 substantially reenacted a part of § 8 of the act of 1891, employing
the term "alien" in the place of the term "alien immigrant," and that similar changes were made in other parts
of the act, came to the conclusion that the change evinced
an intent of Congress to use the word "alien" in its ordinary and unqualified meaning. This decision was reviewed
in this court, and the judgment was reversed, but upon the
ground (207 U. S. 120, 124) that § 18 did not apply to the
ordinary case of a sailor deserting while on shore leave.
Shortly after the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in the Taylor Case, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Rodgers v. United States, ex rel. Buchsbaum (1907), 152 Fed. Rep. 346, held that the provision of
§ 2 of the act of 1903, enumerating the classes of aliens
to be excluded from admission into the United States, and
amongst them "persons afflicted with a loathsome or with
a dangerous contagious disease," and the provision, of
§ 19, for the deportation of "aliens brought into this country in violation of law," could not be construed so as to
extend to aliens domiciled in this country; affirming In re
Buchsbaum, 141 Fed. Rep. 221. In United States v.
Nakashima (1908), 160 Fed. Rep. 842, the Circuit Court
'of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit adopted the same view
of the act of 1903 expressed in the Aultman and Buchsbaum
cases, rejecting that adopted by the Court of Appeals in
Taylor v. United States.
On the other hand, the latter decision has been followed
in a number of cases arising under the act of 1907, which
in this. respect does not materially differ from the act of

(1911), 186 Fed. Rep. 150; and see United States v.
Rodgers (1911), 191 Fed. Rep. 970.
The authority of Congress over the general subjectmatter is plenary; it may exclude aliens altogether, or
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which they may
come into or remain in this country. Chinese Exclusion
Case, 130 U. S. 581, 603; NishimuraEkiu v. United States,
142 U. S. 651, 659; Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149
U. S. 698, 713: Lem Moon Sing v. United States, 158 U. S.
538, 547.
The question, therefore, is not the power of Congress,
but its intent and purpose as expressed in legislation. The
cases that have held the immigration acts not to apply to
domiciled aliens returning after a temporary absence have
been rested in part upon the use of the term "immigration" in the titles of the respective acts, and in part upon
the employment of that or similar terms in the enacting
clauses.
As authority for a liberal interpretation of the acts, two
decisions of this court have at times been referred to,
which have, however, little, if any, present pertinency.
Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, held
that the Contract-labor Law of February 26, 1885 (23
Stat. 332, c. 164), did not forbid a contract for employing
a clergyman. The act was construed according to its
spirit rather than its letter, and in view of its title, the
evil intended to be remedied, the circumstances surround-

Opinion of the Court.

ing the appeal to Congress for legislation, and the reports
of committees in each House, it was held to be the legislative purpose simply to stay the influx of cheap unskilled
labor. Since this decision, an express exception has been
made of "ministers of any religious denomination." In
Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S. 47, this court held
that the provision of the Chinese Restriction Act of
May 6, 1882 (22 Stat. 58, c. 126, § 6) as amended by act
of July 5, 1884 (23 Stat. 115, c. 220), requiring every
Chinese merchant coming into this country to procure
and produce a certificate from the Chinese Government,
did not apply to Chinese merchants already domiciled in
the United States, who, having left this country for some
temporary purpose, sought to reenter it upon their return
to their homes here. But this decision was based in part
upon the language of the particular statute and in part
upon the fact that our treaty with China gave to Chinese
merchants domiciled in the United States the right of
egress and ingress, and the other rights, privileges, and
immunities enjoyed in this country by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation.
The legislative history of the act of 1903 demonstrates
that the elimination of the word "immigrant" and other
equivalent qualifying phrases was done deliberately. The
bill originated in the House of Representatives, where
the Committee Report declared that its general purpose
was "to bring together in one act scattered legislation
heretofore enacted in regard to the immigration of aliens
into the United States . .
to amend such portions
thereof as have been found, either as the result of experience in administering the law or of judicial decision, to
be inadequate to accomplish the purpose plainly intended
thereby; and to add thereto such further provisions as
seemed to be demanded by the consensus of enlightened
public opinion." H. Rept. 982, 57th Cong., 1st Sess.
The report of the Senate Committee likewise explained

the bill as being in the main a reenactment of existing laws
on the subject of immigration, stating-" The necessity
for such reenactment is due in part to the fact that, as a re8ult of judicial decisions, as well as of administrative experience, the efficiency of such laws to accomplish the
evident purpose of their enactment has been shown to be
materially less than appeared to be the case at the time of
such enactment, and therefore a new expression of the
legislative will upon the subject of immigration has become desirable." The Senate inserted the word "immigrant" in one place, but it was eliminated in conference.

Counsel for petitioner cites the debates in Congress as
indicating that the act was not understood to refer to
any others than immigrants. But the unreliability of such
debates as a source from which to discover the meaning of
the language employed in an act of Congress has been
frequently pointed out (United States v. Trans-Missouri

It is. earnestly insisted that the omission of the word
"immigrant" is of little consequence, because it does not
apply at all to the excluding section. It is said that the
w6rds "alien immigrant" did not occur in the acts of
1875, 1882, 1885, or 1887, and did not occur in the excluding section of the act of 1891, but only in its eighth section
-that which related to manifesting. But in the act of
1893, "To facilitate the enforcement," etc., each section
was made to apply to "alien immigrants." The force of
the argument pretty well disappears when we recall that it
was in spite of the absence of the word "immigrant" in the

excluding clause that courts had held that because the
word occurred in the title and in other provisions of the
pertinent acts, the excluding clauses likewise were confined to immigrants, in the sense of aliens who had no
domicile in this country. Of course, there were other
considerations; the extreme hardship in individual cases
where the aliens had long been resident in this country,
and the practically uncontrolled authority of the executive officers of the Government, being among them. But,
whatever considerations may have combined to bring
about the judicial interpretation of the acts that preceded
the Revision of 1903, the committee reports already cited
sufficiently show that the language of the new act was
chosen not for the purpose of adopting, but in order to
avoid, that interpretation.
Upon a review of the whole matter, we are satisfied that
Congress, in the act of 1903, sufficiently expressed, and
in the act of 1907 reiterated, the purpose of applying its
prohibition against the admission of aliens, and its mandate for their deportation, to all aliens whose history, condition or characteristics brought them within the descriptive clauses, irrespective of any qualification arising
out of a previous residence or domicile in this country.
The excluding section as found in the act of 1907 contains in its own language the clearest answer to the entire
argument for the petitioner. It reads as follows (34 Stat.
898, c. 1134, § 2): "That the following classes of aliens shall
be excluded from admission into the United States: All
idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, insane
persons, and persons who have been insane within five
years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks
of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons likely
to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons
afflicted with tuberculosis or with a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not comprehended within
any of the foregoing excluded classes who are found to be

and are certified by the examining surgeon as being mentally or physically defective, such mental or physical
defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of
such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other
crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or persons who admit their belief in the practice
of polygamy, anarchists, or persons who believe in or
advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States, or of all government, or of
all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials;
prostitutes, or women or girls coming into the United
States for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose; persons who procure or attempt to bring
in prostitutes or women or girls for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose; persons hereinafter called contract laborers, who have been induced or
solicited to migrate to this country by offers or promises
of employment or in consequence of agreements, oral,
written or printed, express or implied, to perform labor
in this country of any kind, skilled or unskilled;" etc., etc.
None of these excluded classes (with the possible exception of contract laborers, whose exclusion depends upon
somewhat different considerations) would be any less undesirable if previously domiciled in the United States.
And besides, the section contains its own specific provisos
a.d limitations, and these, on familiar principles, strongly
tend to negative any other and implied exception.
There remains, therefore,' only the use of the word
"immigration" in the title of the act to furnish support
fer petitioner's contention. But it is only in a doubtful
case that the title of an act can control the meaning of
the enacting clauses, and there is no such doubt here.

It was not intended, in the opinion of this court in
Taylor v. United States, 207 U. S. 120, 126, to intimate
an opinion with respect to the construction of § 18 of the
act of 1903 that is inconsistent with the result now
reached. There the Circuit Court of Appeals (one judge
dissenting) had construed that section as excluding even
the ordinary sailor, if an alien; basing this construction
upon the changes wrought by Congress in the revision of
1903. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Holmes, said:
"A reason for the construction adopted below was found
in the omission of the word 'immigrant' which had
followed 'alien' in the earlier acts. No doubt that may
have been intended to widen the reach of the statute,
but we see no reason to suppose that the omission meant
to do more than to avoid the suggestion that no one wfs
within the act who did not come here with intent to
remain. It is not necessary to regard the change as a
mere abbreviation, although the title of the statute is
'An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the
United States."' Of course, this language was employed
with reference to the facts of that case, and was not intended to negative a purpose on the part of Congress to
bring within the reach of the statute aliens who had previously resided in this country. In that case there was
no element of previous residence.
Judgment affirmed.
