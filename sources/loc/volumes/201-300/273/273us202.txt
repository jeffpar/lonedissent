ment here consisted mainly of an effort to show, by reference in the brief to portions of the evidence introduced
before the Court of Claims, that the contract sued on was
made as alleged and that authority to make it had been
conferred upon the depot quartermaster. The evidence is
not before us; and we must accept the findings of the
Court of Claims. Rogers v. United States, 270 U. S. 154,
162. Moreover, it is doubtful whether even express authorization could, under the then existing statutes, have
conferred upon anyone the power to make the contract
which the plaintiff has attempted to prove. See Rev.
Stat. § 3732, as amended by Act of June 12, 1906, c. 3078,
34 Stat. 240, 255; Rev. Stat. § 3709, Act of July 5, 1884,

The decision of the lower court was clearly correct.
The Dent Act gave a remedy upon contracts irregularly
made, not upon contracts made without authority. Nor
did it give a cause of action on dealings which did not
ripen into a contract. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v.

Mr. Ben A. Matthews for the defendant in error.
Perjury is one method-perhaps the most obviousof defeating or evading the tax.
The language of the earlier revenue statutes is significant. They condemn one method of defeating or evading the tax, namely, the delivery or disclosure to the
collector of any false or fraudulent return. The Act of
1918, extended the prohibition to "any manner" of defeating or evading the tax, clearly intending to embrace
all methods.
The fact that Congress, in subsequent acts (Act of
1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, § 1017; Act of 1926, c. 27, 44
Stat. 9, § 1114), while including § 253 (in sub-division
[b]), has, in an additional and closely associated provision (sub-division [c]), grouped "preparation" and
"presentation" of the return in the disjunctive shows
that Congress has not at all times had in mind the strict
distinction, for which the Government argues, between
the making and the filing of a return.
The determining factor as to whether § 253 repeals
pro tanto § 125 of the Criminal Code, is whether the
perjury here charged amounted to an attempt to defeat
or evade the tax. The very history of the law against
evasions or attempted evasions cited by the Government
indicates that even false entries were so regarded by Congress. Act of 1909, § 35.

This case would, therefore, seem to fall within the
doctrine laid down in United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall.
88; United States v. Yuginovich, 256 U. S. 450; and
Grogan v. Walker & Son, 259 U. S. 80. Distinguishing
Morgan v. Devine, 237 U. S. 632; Steinberg v. United
States, 14 Fed. (2d) 564. The authorities upon which
the court relied are almost entirely concerned with perjury at common law. The making of a false affidavit
is perjury at common law only when it is made in a
judicial proceeding or court of justice. No such restriction is imposed by § 125, which may be said, for convenience of phraseology, to create the crime of false
swearing as distinguished from the narrower one of
common law perjury.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Noveck was indicted in two counts under § 125 of the
Criminal Code, in the federal court for southern New
York, for perjury in making returns for the purpose of
taxation.' To the first count he pleaded the statute of
limitations. The District Court sustained the plea; and
its judgment was affirmed in United States v. Noveck, 271
U. S. 201. To the second count he filed both a demurrer
and a motion to quash on the ground that it did not state
facts sufficient to constitute an offense. The objection
was overruled. Thereupon, Noveck pleaded guilty. He
'Section 125: "Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent
tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United
States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify,
declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, shall willfully and contrary to such oath state or subscribe any material matter
which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall
be fified not more than two thousand dollars and imprisoned not
more than five years."

was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 and to imprisonment
for four months. He paid the fine and was taken into
custody.
While Noveck was still in prison, the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in
Steinberg v. United States, an unreported opinion, that
§ 125 of the Criminal Code had been repealed, so far as
concerns perjury on tax returns, by § 253 of the Revenue
Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 268, which makes it an
offense willfully to attempt in any manner to defeat or
evade a tax.2 The term of the District Court at which
Noveck was sentenced not having ended, he moved immediately to vacate the sentence. The motion was
granted; a motion in arrest of judgment was sustained;
and the court allowed this writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act, March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
After the docketing of the case in this Court, the Court
of Appeals withdrew its unreported opinioh in the Steinberg case and, reversing itself, held that the Revenue Act
of 1921 did not repeal § 125 of the Criminal Code as
applied to perjury on tax returns, 14 F. (2d) 564. The
Government, deeming it impossible to reinstate Noveck's
'Section 253 provides: "That any individual, corporation, or partnership required under this title to pay or collect any tax, to make
a return or to supply information, who fails to pay or collect such
tax, to make such return, or to supply such information at the time
or times required under this title, shall be liable to a penalty of not
more than $1,000. Any individual, corporation, or partnership, or
any officer or employee of any corporation or member or employee
of a partnership, who willfully refuses to pay or collect such tax, to
make such return, or to supply such information at the time or times
required under this title, or who willfully attempts in any manner to
defeat or evade the tax imposed by this title, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned
for not more than one year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution." The wording follows exactly that of § 253 of the Revenue
Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1085, under which Noveck made the
return in question.

sentence by any proceeding in the District Court, continues to prosecute the writ of error. Compare Keyser
v. Farr,105 U. S. 265.
The jurisdiction of this Court is conceded. The sole
question requiring discussion is whether § 253 of the
Revenue Act of 1918 (re-enacted as § 253 of the Revenue
Act of 1921) repeals, as to false tax returns, § 125 of the
Criminal Code. There was confessedly no express repeal;
and it is clear that the two sections are not inconsistent.
Noveck's contention is that a repeal was effected, because
Congress manifested the intention of supplanting the
provision of the Criminal Code, in so far as it relates to
perjury in income tax returns, by embodying in the Revenue Act all provisions dealing with the various methods
of defeating or evading taxes therein imposed. The argument is that § 253 of the Revenue Act includes within
its condemnation anyone "who willfully attempts in any
manner to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this title;"
that perjury to an income tax return is one manner or
method of defeating or evading the tax; and that, since
all methods are made punishable under § 253, Congress
must have intended that perjury in making false returns
should no longer be punishable under § 125.
The conclusion stated does not follow. The offenses
defined in the two statutes are not identical. They are
entirely distinct in point of law, even when they arise out
of the same transaction or act. Each involves an element
not found in the other. Compare Morgan v. Devine, 237
U. S. 632. The crime of perjury is complete when the
oath is taken with the necessary intent, although the false
affidavit is never used. Noah v. United States, 128 Fed.
270; Berry v. United States, 259 Fed. 203. Compare
United States v. Rhodes, 30 Fed. 431, 433. The making
of a false affidavit, without presentation thereof, does not
constitute an attempt to evade the tax law. See United
States v. Rachmil, 270 Fed. 869, 871. The crime of at-

tempting to defeat or evade the Revenue Law may be
committed without verification of a false tax return.
Emmich v. United States, 298 Fed. 5, 10. Congress, having power to make both the false swearing and the use
of the false affidavit punishable, Albrecht v. United
States, ante, p. 1, did so. Compare United States v.
Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78; Kennedy v. United States,
265 U. S. 344. The fact that perjury is a felony, while
filing a false return is only a misdemeanor, presented no
obstacle. Compare United States v. Lawrence, 26 Fed.
Cas. No. 15,572. There is nothing in the history of the
revenue legislation which should lead us to a different conclusion. Our decision is in accord with the view taken by
those circuit courts of appeals which have dealt with the
question. Levin v. United States, 5 F. (2d) 598, 600;
Steinberg v. United States, 14 F. (2d) 564.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 45.

Argued December 2, 1926.--Decided February 21, 1927.

1. Where a shipowner sues in admiralty to limit his liability from
negligent management of his vessel to the value of the vessel and
pending freight, the proceeding does not necessarily terminate
if his prayer is denied, but the Court may thereupon proceed to
adjudicate all the claims coming from the accident, whether independently cognizable in admiralty or not, after the manner of a
court of equity, and render judgment both in rem, and against the
owner in personam. P. 213.
2. A stipulation ad interim in such proceedings takes the place of the
vessel and freight, and even when the shipowner's application to
limit liability is denied, the stipulator may be required to pay their
value into court for application to allowed claims and costs. P. 218.
3 F. (2d) 923, affirmed.
