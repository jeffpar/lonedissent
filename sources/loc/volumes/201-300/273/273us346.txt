necessary. Its power to regulate such commerce and all
its instrumentalities is supreme; and, as that power has
been exerted, state laws have no application. They cannot be applied in coincidence with, as complementary to
or as in opposition to, federal enactments which disclose
the intention of Congress to enter a field of regulation

(271 U. S. 658, 659) to judgments of the

Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed judgments
against the collector in the District Court in three suits to
recover back income and excess profits taxes which he had
collected from the respondents here by distraint.
Mr. Charles T. Hendler, Special Attorney, Bureau of
Internal Revenue, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell
and Mr. A. W. Gregg, General Counsel, Bureau of Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for the petitioner.
Winifred Sullivan for the respondent, in No. 366.
Messrs. Bern Budd, Henry P. Keith, and Benjamin
Mahler for the respondent, in No. 367.
Messrs. George W. Matthews and Thomas S. Fuller
for the respondent, in No. 368.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In No. 366, respondent, March 26, 1918, filed its return
of income and excess-profits taxes for 1917 and paid the
amount shown due. Shortly before the expiration of
five years after the return the commissioner assessed and
the collector demanded payment of additional income
and excess-profits taxes. Respondent refused to pay.
More than five years after the return the collector distrained and sold personal property of the respondent to
pay the amount claimed.
In No. 367, respondent, February 28, 1917, filed his
return of income taxes for 1916 and paid the amount
shown due. Later an additional tax was assessed; and,
more than five years after the return, the collector sought
to enforce payment by distraint. Respondent brought
suit to restrain the collection on the ground that it was
barred by the limit fixed by § 250 (d), Revenue Act of
1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265), and that respondent had
no adequate remedy at law. The district court denied

relief and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals. 297 Fed. 371. The latter expressed the view
that distraint was barred, and held that respondent had
an adequate remedy at law. Later the collector enforced
payment by distraint.
In No. 368, respondent, February 27, 1917, filed his
income tax return for 1916 and paid the amount shown
due. The commissioner, February 27, 1922, assessed an
additional income tax. In 1924 the collector enforced
payment by distraint.
Each respondent sued in the southern district of New
York to recover the amount so collected. Judgments for
respondents were affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 10 F. (2d) 1017. Writs of certiorari were granted.
271 U. S. 658, 659.
The question for decision is this: Where, under the
tax laws enacted prior to the Revenue Act of 1921, income and excess-profits taxes.were assessed within five
years after filing return, does § 250 (d) of that Act bar
collection by distraint proceedings begun after the expiration of the five-year period?
The part of the subdivision that has a bearing is printed
in the margin.' The clause in controversy is: "No suit
'The amount of income, excess-profits, or war-profits taxes due
under any return made under this Act for the taxable year 1921 or succeeding taxable years shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within four years after the return was filed, and the amount
of any such taxes due under any return made under this Act for
prior taxable years or under prior income, excess-profits, or warprofits tax Acts . . .shall be determined and assessed within five
years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and
the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment,
and collection of the tax; and no suit or proceeding for the collection
of any such taxes due under this Act or under prior income, excessprofits, or war-profits tax Acts .. .shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed, but this
shall not affect suits or proceedings begun at the time of the passage

of this Act.

or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes
shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the
date when such return was filed." Petitioner insists that
the word "proceeding" refers only to a proceeding in
court and means the same as "suit "; and that the Act
prescribes no limitation against the collection of such
taxes by distraint.
There are two methods to compel payment. One is
suit, a judicial proceeding; the other is distraint, an executive proceeding. The word "proceeding" is aptly and
commonly used to comprehend steps taken in pursuit of
either. There is nothing in the language or context that
indicates an intention to restrict its meaning, or to use
"suit " and "proceeding" synonymously.
The purpose of the enactment was to fix a time beyond
which steps to enforce collection might not be initiated.
The repose intended would not be attained if suits only
were barred, leaving the collector free at any time to
proceed by distraint. In fact, distraint is much more
frequently resorted to than is suit for the collection of
taxes. The mischiefs to be remedied by setting a time
limit against distraint are the same as those eliminated
by bar against suit. Under petitioner's construction taxpayers having no property within reach of the collector
would be protected against stale demands, while others
would be liable to have their property distrained and sold
to pay like claims. The result tends strongly to discredit
petitioner's contention.
He maintains that any ambiguity in the clause under
consideration must be resolved in his favor. Undoubtedly the United States will not be held barred by a
general statute of limitation unless, upon a strict construction in its favor, the United States and the claim
sought to be enforced fairly may be held to be within the
terms and purpose of the statute. Dupont De Nemours
& Co. v. Davis, 264 U, S. 456, 462. That rule rests upon

350

273 U, S.

the general principle of policy applicable to all governments that the public interest should not be prejudiced
by the default or negligence of public officers. United
States v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry. Co., 247 U. S. 310, 314.
The limitation applies to petitioner and to the claims.
It applies to suit; the only question is whether it also
bars distraint. The provision is a part of a taxing statute; and such laws are to be interpreted liberally in favor
of the taxpayers. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578,
583; Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U. S. 529, 536. There has been
suggested no principle of public policy or other consideration that furnishes any reasonable support for the
setting of a limitation against only one of the two
authorized methods of enforcing collection.
The provision is to be applied in harmony with the
intention reasonably to be inferred from its terms and
the circumstances of its enactment. Cf. United States v.
Oregon Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 290, 299. Prior to the
Revenue Act of 1918 there was no limitation against suit
to collect income taxes. Section 250(d) of that Act (40
Stat. 1083) required assessment within five years after
return, and prohibited the commencement of suit or
proceeding to collect such taxes after that period. This
bar was held to apply only in respect of taxes for 1918
and later years. Then § 250(d) of the Act of 1921 made
the limitation apply against collection of taxes under all
the earlier Acts; and, in pursuance of a legislative purpose
to require more prompt action upon the part of the commissioner and collectors, prescribed the five-year period
for determination and assessment of taxes under earlier
Acts but allowed only four year as to those for 1921 and
succeeding years. The same purpose is shown by the
requirement that the commissioner, within one year after
request by their personal representatives, shall make
assessments on income received by deceased persons.
These stricter limitations applicable to taxes for the later

BOWERS v. N. Y. & ALBANY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

period make against the petitioner's contention that the
Act sets no bar against collection by distraint. A reasonable view of the matter is that it was the intention of
Congress by the clause here in question to protect taxpayers against any proceeding whatsoever for the collection of tax claims not made and pressed within five
years.
Petitioner's construction of the limitation is inconsistent with the provision immediately preceding it.
"The amount of any such taxes due under any return
. . . shall be determined and assessed within five years
after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner
and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax." If collection
by distraint were not barred by § 250(d) it would not be
necessary to have this general consent of taxpayers that
collection, as well as determination and assessment, might
be made after the lapse of the prescribed period.
Later legislation assumes that the limitation under
consideration applies to distraints as well as to suits.
See § 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43
Stat. 253, 300. Section 278(d) provides that, where
assessment is made within the prescribed time, the tax
may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court
within six years after the assessment. And § 278(e)
provides: "This section shall not authorize the assessment of a tax or the collection thereof by distraint or
by a proceeding in court if at the time of the enactment
of this Act such assessment, distraint, or proceeding was
barred by the period of limitation then in existence."
This plainly implies that distraint might be barred. And
the limitation prescribed by § 250(d) is the only one that
could have that effect. See also § 278(d) and (e),
Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59.
The word "proceedings" is rightly used as descriptive
of steps taken for the distraint and sale of property to
enforce payment of taxes. See Parker v. Rule's Lessee,

9 Cranch 64, 70; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land and
Improvement Co., 18 How. 272; Sheridan v. Allen, 153
Fed. 568. Cf. Scottish Union & Nat. Ins. Co. v. Bowland,
196 U. S. 611, 632, 633; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 66.
In a later part, subdivision (g), of § 250, "proceedings"
is used broadly in reference to steps for the collection of
taxes. Obviously its meaning is not there limited to
collection by suit. And in other parts of the Internal
Revenue Laws, enacted before this controversy arose,
that word is used as descriptive of steps taken to distrain
and sell personal property and to seize and sell real estate
for the collection of taxes. See R. S., §§ 3194, 3199, 3200,
3203; side-notes to §§ 3190 and 3197.2 .Section 250(d)
of the Act of 1921 and these sections of the Revised
Statutes relate to the same subject and are to be construed
together.
It is clear that the meaning of "proceeding" as used
in the clause of limitation in § 250(d), Revenue Act of
1921, cannot be restricted to steps taken in a suit; it
includes as well steps taken for the collection of taxes
by distraint.
Judgments affirmed.
