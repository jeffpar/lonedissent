v. UNITED STATES.

ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 9.

Argued November 23, 1926 -Decided January 3, 1927.

1. An arrest under a federal warrant based on affidavits verified before
a notary public-a state official without authority to administer
oaths in federal criminal proceedings-is in violation of the Fourth
Amendment. P. 5.
2. An information can not be filed by a United States attorney without leave of court. P. 5.
3. The official oath of the United States Attorney may be accepted
as sufficient verification of an information. P. 6.
4. Where an information gave the court to understand and be informed etc., "on affidavits" referred to, the invalidity of the affidavits and their use with the information as a basis for applying
for and issuing warrants of arrest, did not affect the validity of the
information. P. 6.
5. Where the information is valid but the warrant of arrest is based
on insufficiently verified affidavits, the irregularity of the warrant
may be waived. P. 8.
6. Mere giving of a bail bond without objection to the warrant does
not waive invalidity of the warrant, or operate as a general appearance. P. 9.
7. Objection to arrest upon the ground that affidavits supporting the
warrant are defective should be by motion to quash the warrant,
not the information. P. 9.
8. A motion to quash a warrant issued upon insufficiently verified
affidavits is too late if the defendant is in court and the affidavits
have been amended before the motion is filed. P. 10.

Mr. Charles A. Houts, with whom Messrs. Samuel W.
Baxter and D. E. Keefe were on the brief, for the plaintiffs in error.
An information, when made the basis of an application for warrant of arrest, must be supported by an affidavit showing probable cause. 2 Op. Atty Gen. 266;

United States v. Tureaud, 20 Fed. 621; Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch 448. The affidavits filed originally with
the information were sworn to before a notary public
and were therefore insufficient, United States v. Schallinger Produce Co., 230 Fed. 20. The affidavits which
were on file at the time the warrant issued were nullities.
and the information was unsupported by any affidavit
which would be sufficient under the laws of the United
States. The affidavits could not be lawfully amended.

McDonald, supra; United States v. Schallinger Produce

and execution of the warrant, by substituting new affidavits, did not have the effect of validating the information as originally filed, and the arrest made thereon, prior
to the amendment of the affidavits. United States v.

which justify the issuance of a warrant and the officer
is required by law to satisfy himself of the sufficiency
of the affidavit and let the circumstances 6all for the

and his associates were sentenced to either fine or imprisonment upon each of nine counts of an information
charging violations of the National Prohibition Act.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

273 U. S.

There is no contention that the offences charged could
not be prosecuted by information. See Brede v. Powers,
263 U. S. 4, 10; Rossini v. United States, 6 F. (2d) 350.
The claims mainly urged are that, because of defects in
the information and affidavits attached, there was no
jurisdiction in the District Court and that rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment were violated. Several
important questions of practice are presented which have
not been passed upon by this Court, and on which there
has been diversity of opinion in the lower courts, due in
part to language in the opinions in United States v.
Morgan, 222 U. S. 274, 282, and in United States v.
Thompson, 251 U. S. 407, 413-414.
The information recites that it was filed by the United
States Attorney with leave of the court; and the truth of
this allegation has not been questioned. A bench warrant issued; and the marshal executed it by arresting the
defendants. When they were brought into court, each
gave bond to appear and answer; was released from
custody immediately; and was not thereafter in custody
by virtue of the warrant or otherwise. At the time of
giving the bonds, no objection was made to either the
jurisdiction or the service by execution of the warrant;
and nothing was done then indicating an intention to
enter a special appearance. On a later day, the defendants filed a motion to quash the information; declared in
the motion that they "specifically limit their appearance
in the cause for the purpose of interposing" it; and protested that the court was without jurisdiction. The main
ground urged in support of the objection was that the
information had not been verified by the United States
Attorney; that it recited he "gives the court to understand and be informed, on the affidavit of I. A. Miller
and D. P. Coggins "; and that these affidavits, which were
annexed to the information, had been sworn to before a
notary public-a state official not authorized to admin-

ister oaths in federal criminal proceedings. Compare
United States v. Hall, 131 U. S. 50. With leave of court,
new oaths to the affidavits were immediately sworn to
before the Deputy Clerk of the Court, and additional
affidavits, also sworn to before him, were filed. Thereupon, a new motion to quash, setting forth the same
grounds, was filed by the defendants; and this motion
extended to both the information and the warrant. It
also was denied; and a demurrer interposed upon the same
ground was overruled. Then, upon a plea of not guilty,
the defendants were tried, with the result stated; and a
motion in arrest of judgment was denied.
As the affidavits on which the warrant issued had not
been properly verified, the arrest was in violation of the
clause in the Fourth Amendment which declares that "no
warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported
by oath or affirmation." See Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch
448, 453; United States v. Michalski, 265 Fed. 839. But
it does not follow that because the arrest was illegal, the
information was or became void. The information was
filed by leave of court. Despite some practice and statements to the contrary, it may be accepted as settled, that
leave must be obtained; and that before granting leave,
the court must, in some way, satisfy itself that there is
probable cause for the prosecution.1 This is done someI The great majority of the lower courts dealing with the subject
have insisted that the district attorney secure leave of court before
filing informations, and have refused to grant leave except upon a
showing of probable cause. United States v. Shepard, Fed. Cas. No.
16,273; United States v. Maxwell, Fed. Cas. No. 15,750; United States
v. Baugh, 1 Fed. 784; United States v. Reilley, 20 Fed. 46; United
States v. Smith, 40 Fed. 755; United States v. Schurman, 177 Fed.
581; United States v. Quaritius, 267 Fed. 227. In some districts the
United States attorney has been permitted to file an information
upon a purely formal allegation of leave, but the court determined
the question of the existence of probable cause upon a motion of the
defendant to withdraw leave. United States v. Simon, 243 Fed. 980;

times by a verification of the information, and frequently
by annexing affidavits thereto. But these are not the
only means by which a court may become satisfied that
probable cause for the prosecution exists.2 The United
States Attorney, like the Attorney General or Solicitor
General of England, may file an information under his
oath of office; and, if he does so, his official oath may be
accepted as sufficient to give verity to the allegations of
the information. See Weeks v. United States, 216 Fed.
292, 302.
It is contended that this information was not presented
on the official oath of the United States Attorney; that
instead of informing on his official oath, he gave "the
court to understand and be informed on the affidavit[s] "
referred to; and that, for this reason, the information is
to be likened, not to those filed in England by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General, but to those
exhibited there by Masters of the Crown upon information of a private informer; that the latter class of informaYaffee v. United States, 276 Fed. 497. The statements in Ryan v.
United States, 5 F. (2d) 667, and Miller v. United States, 6 F. (2d)
463, that the United States attorney may file informations as of
right, are based upon an incidental remark in United States v. Thompson, 251 U. S. 407, 413-414, which must be disregarded.
2A few cases have considered a verification essential to the validity
of an information. United States v. Tureaud, 20 Fed. 621; United
States v. Strickland, 25 Fed. 469. Compare Johnston v. United States,
87 Fed. 187; United States v. Wells, 225 Fed. 320. See United States
v. Morgan, 222 U. S. 274, 282. The opposite conclusion was reached
after great deliberation in Weeks v. United States, 216 Fed. 292,
since followed by many cases. Reference may be made to United
States v. Adams Express Co., 230 Fed. 531; Simpson v. United tates,
241 Fed. 841; Abbott Bros. Co. v. United States, 242 Fed. 751;
Kelly v. United States, 250 Fed. 947; Brown v. United States, 257

tions were required by Stat. 4 & 5, W. & M. C. 18, to
be supported by affidavit of the person at whose instance
they were preferred; that this requirement for informations of that character became a part of our common
law; and, that, because the affidavits were not properly
verified, the information could not confer jurisdiction.
The practice of prosecuting lesser federal crimes by
information, instead of indictment, has been common
since 1870.1 But, in federal proceedings, no trace has
been found of the differentiation in informations for such
crimes, or of any class of informations instituted by a
private informer comparable to those dealt with in England by Stat. 4 & 5, W. & M. C. 18.
The reference to the affidavits in this information is
not to be read as indicating that it was presented otherwise than upon the oath of office of the United States
Attorney.4 The affidavits were doubtless referred to in
sTwo different courts, having before them criminal informations,
were able to say, as late as 1870, that there had been no use of that
procedure known to them up to that time. United States v. Shepard,
Fed. Cas. No. 16,273; United States v. Cultus Joe, Fed. Cas. No.
15,478. See also Abbott's United States Practice, Vol. II, 177. Story
writing in 1833, said that there was very little use of informations
except in civil prosecutions for penalties and forfeitures. The Constitution, § 1780. In 1864, Congress passed a statute which provided
for a summary criminal proceeding, begun by sworn complaint, in
cases involving minor offenses by seamen. Act of June 11, 1864,
c. 121, §§ 2, 3, 13 Stat. 124. In 1870 was passed a statute authorizing
prosecution by indictment or information for crimes against the
franchise. Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 8, 16 Stat. 142. While
there was probably a sporadic use of informations in criminal proceedings during the first eighty years of the government, as in
United States v. Mann, Fed. Cas. No. 15,717 (1812), the use did not
become general until after 1870. After 1870 prosecutions by information became frequent. See United States v. Waller, Fed. Cas. No.
16,634; United States v. Maxwell, Fed. Cas. No. 15,750; United States
v. Baugh, 1 Fed. 784. See also, Ex parte Wilson, 114 U. S. 417, 425.

the information, not as furnishing probable cause for the
prosecution, but because it was proposed to use the information and affidavits annexed as the basis for an application for a warrant of arrest. If before granting the
warrant, the defendants had entered a voluntary appearance, the reference and the affidavits could have been
treated as surplusage, and would not have vitiated the
information.' The fact that the information and affidavits were used as a basis for the application for a warrant did not affect the validity of the information as such.'
Whether the whole proceeding was later vitiated by the
false arrest remains to be considered.
The invalidity of the warrant is not comparable to the
invalidity of an indictment. A person may not be
punished for a crime without a formal and sufficient accusation even if he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction
of the court. Compare Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1. But
a false arrest does not necessarily deprive the court of
jurisdiction of the proceeding in which it was made.
Where there was an appropriate accusation either by indictment or information, a court may acquire jurisdiction
over the person of the defendant by his voluntary appearance. 7 That a defendant may be brought before the court
by a summons, without an arrest, is shown by the practice
in prosecutions against corporations which are necessarily
commenced by a summons.8 Here, the court had juris5 Compare Weeks v. United States, 216 Fed. 292; Poleskey v. United

The leading case on the use of summons in criminal prosecutions

diction of the subject matter; and the persons named as
defendants were within its territorial jurisdiction. The
judgment assailed would clearly have been good, if the
objection had not been taken until after the verdict.'
This shows that the irregularity in the warrant was of
such a character that it could be waived. Was it waived?
And, if not, was it cured?
The bail bonds bound the defendants to "be and appear" in court "from day to day" and "to answer and
stand trial upon the information herein and to stand by
and abide the orders and judgment of the Court in the
premises." It is urged there was a waiver by giving the
bail bonds without making any objection. We are of the
opinion that the failure to take the objection at that
time did not waive the invalidity of the warrant or operate
as a general appearance." An objection to the illegality

1°There has been no discussion, in the federal courts, of the
possible effect of a bail bond as a waiver of the right to object to an
illegal arrest. In United States v. Shepard, Fed. Cas. No. 16,273,
and United States v. Wells, 225 Fed. 320, the court quashed informations because of the illegality of the arrest, though the defendants
had given bond without objecting to the illegality, but the question
of waiver was apparently not pressed upon the courts. The trend
of authority in the state courts does not consider that giving bond is
a waiver, since the defendant must give bond or go to jail, and will
ordinarily have little knowledge of his legal rights. People v. Gardner,
71 Misc. 335, 130 N. Y. Supp. 202; State v. Simmons, 39 Kan. 262

of the arrest could have been taken thereafter by a motion
to quash the warrants, though technically the defendants
were then held under their bonds, the warrants having
performed their functions. But the first motion to quash
was not directed to the invalidity of the warrant. As that
motion to quash was directed solely to the information, it
could not raise the question of the validity of the warrant. 1 The motion to quash the warrant was not made
until after the government had filed properly verified
affidavits by leave of court. Thereby the situation had
been changed. The affidavits then on file would have
supported a new warrant, which, V issued, would plainly
have validated the proceedings thenceforward. Compare In re Johnson,167 U. S. 120. There was no occasion
to apply for a new warrant, because the defendants were
already in court."' The defect in the proceeding by which
they had been brought into court had been cured. By
failing to move to quash the warrant before the defect
had been cured, the defendants lost their right to object.
It is thus unnecessary to decide whether it would have
been proper to allow the amendment, and deny the mo428. It is of course possible that giving bail plus very little else may
amount to a waiver. Ard v. State, 114 Ind. 542; State v. McClain,
13 N. Dak. 368.
11 There has been confusion as to the proper method of taking an
objection to an illegal arrest. Some cases in the lower federal courts
have apparently allowed it to be taken by a motion to quash the
information or indictment. United States v. Illig, 288 Fed. 939.
Compare United States v. Tureaud, 20 Fed. 621; Johnston v. United
States, 87 Fed. 187; United States v. Wells, 225 Fed. 320. Later
decisions require that the objection be taken to the warrant, not to
the information or indictment. Farinelli v. United States, 297 Fed.

tion to quash, if the attack on the warrant had been made
before the amendment of the affidavits. "3
There is a claim of violation of the Fifth Amendment
by the imposition of double punishment. This contention rests upon the following facts. Of the nine counts
in the information four charged illegal possession of
liquor, four illegal sale and one maintaining a common
nuisance. The contention is that there was double punishment because the liquor which the defendants were
convicted for having sold is the same that they were convicted for having possessed. But possessing and selling
are distinct offenses. One may obviously possess without
selling; and one may sell and cause to be delivered a
thing of which he has never had possession; or one may
have possession and later sell, as appears to have been
done in this case. The fact that the person sells the liquor
which he possessed does not render the possession and the
sale necessarily a single offence. There is nothing in the
Constitution which prevents Congress from punishing
separately each step leading to the consummation of a
transaction which it has power to prohibit and punishing
also the completed transaction. The precise question
does not appear to have been discussed in either this or a
lower federal court in connection with the National Prohibition Act; but the general principle is well established.

States, 4 F. (2d) 110.

As to allowing, after objection taken, the

amendment of the process by which the defendant has been brought
into court, see People v. Hildebrand, 71 Mich. 313; Town of Ridgeland v. Gens, 83 S. C. 562; Keehn v. Stein, 72 Wis. 196 (but see
Scheer v. Keown, 29 Wis. 586). Compare State v. McCray, 74 Mo.
303. In State v. Turner, 170 N. C. 701, 702, the court said: "Even
if one is wrongfully arrested on process that is defective, being in
court, he would not be discharged, but the process would be amended
then and there, or if the service were defective it could be served
