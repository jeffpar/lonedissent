as to them, might have been declared fraudulent. It
seems clear that the State, without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, might have enacted through its legislative department a statute of precisely the same effect
as the rule of law and public policy declared by the Court
of Appeals, and its decision is just as valid as such a statute would have been. PrudentialInsurance Co. v. Cheek,
259 U. S. 530, 548.
The above-expressed view is sufficiently confirmed by
what this Court said in Mutual Reserve Association v.
Phelps, 190 U. S. 147, 158, 159, which upheld the validity
of a statute providing for service of process after a corporation had ceased to do business within and had withdrawn all agents from the State; and Lemieux v. Young,
Trustee, 211 U. S. 489, 492, 495, and Kidd, Dater Co. v.
Musselman Grocer Co., 217 U. S. 461, 472, et seq., which
sustained the power of a State to impose liability for the
seller's debts upon a purchaser of merchandise in bulk.

CERTIORARI (268 U. S. 687) to a judgment of the Special Court of Appeals of Virginia which affirmed a judgment recovered against the petitioner by the respondent,
based on a judgment previously recovered against the
Southern Express Company, whose express business and
operating property the petitioner took over.
Mr. Branch P. Kerfoot, with whom Mr. Charles W.
Stockton was on the brief, for petitioner.
The basis of fact upon which the Special Court of
Appeals of Virginia rests its decision denying the asserted
federal right has no support in the record.
The proof shows that the Southern Express Company
did not sell its business nor did the petitioner undertake
to carry on its business in Virginia or elsewhere, and
that, independently of the stock of petitioner received by
the Southern Express Company, it had approximately
$1,000,000 in assets which were amply sufficient to meet
all of its legal liabilities. The court held that the law in
Virginia in reference to the merger of the Southern Express Company and others into the petitioner as a consolidated company liable for the debts of the constituent
companies had already been settled by the case of American Ry. Exp. Co. v. Downing, 132 Va. 139.
The capital stock becomes a trust fund only where the
corporation is insolvent or in process of dissolution.

LaCrosse R. R. Co., 102 U. S. 148; McDonald v. Williams, 174 U. S. 397.
To hold the petitioner liable for debts of the Southern
Express Company, it would be necessary for the record

to show (1) that there was an actual consolidation or
merger under which the Southern Express Company became extinguished and the petitioner either expressly or
by necessary implication of law undertook to pay its
debts or liabilities; or (2) that the Southern Express
Company was insolvent and that the transfer of the
property to the petitioner was a fraudulent conveyance
without consideration to defeat the creditors of the
Southern Express Company.
It is true that where stock given for the property has
been distributed to the stockholders of the debtor corporation, and no other assets were found to meet its liabilities, the courts have held that creditors were not obliged
to pursue their remedy against the individual stockholders, but might follow the property. But this comes back
to the proposition that in every such case there was no
bona fide sale or purchase, but a fraudulent transfer to
distribute corporate assets among shareholders in fraud
of creditors. In the case at bar payment in stock, instead
of cash, for the property bought by petitioner did not in
any way affect the rights or even the convenience of Virginia creditors. Neither the buyer nor the seller was a
Virginia corporation and the contract was made in New
York. If the petitioner had paid for the property in
cash, there would have been no more assets in Virginia
for the convenience of Virginia creditors than there were
under the actual conditions of the sale. The Virginia
court, therefore, did not have before it in the record, nor
were there in existence, the facts necessary to support its
decision, and it is the duty of this Court to review and
correct the error. Postal Tel. Co. v. Newport, 247 U. S.
473; Sou. Pac. Co. v. Schuyler, 227 U. S. 611; N. C. Ry.
Co. v. Zachary, 232 U. S. 248; Carlsonv. Curtis, 234 U. S.

AMER. RY. EXPRESS v. ROYSTER CO.

277

Argument for Petitioner.

The decision of the state court is not based upon
principles of common law but is an attempt at judicial
legislation under the police power of the State which
can not be applied retroactively t6 affect vested rights.
Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239; Crutcher v. Kentucky,
141 U. S. 474.
If the rule announced would have been unconstitutional
as a statute, it seems clear that this Court can review it
if its effect is to deny petitioner the equal protection of
the law and deprive it of property without due process of
law. PrudentialIns. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 529.
The amendment of February 17, 1922, to ยง 237 of the
Judicial Code, clearly indicates that a change in a rule of
law established in a State by judicial decision may violate rights under the Federal Constitution. It is the duty
of federal courts to determine for themselves questions of
commercial law, general jurisprudence, and of rights under
the Constitution of the United States. Oates v. Bank,
100 U. S. 246; Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1; Guernsey v.
Bank, 188 Fed. 300; Bank v. Liewer, 187 Fed. 16; Grt.

Co., 173 Fed. 750; Brewer-Elliott Oil Co. v. United
States, 270 Fed. 104. To make the decisions of the state
court obligatory on the federal court, the right must have
accrued after the rule was established. Murray v. Wilson
Dist. Co., 213 U. S. 157; Grt. Southern Hotel Co. v. Jones,
supra.
The general rule of the common law is that a corporation which purchased aJl the property of another corporation is not ipso facto liable for the debts of the latter.

Opinion of the Court.

273 U. S.

The judgment against the Southern Express Company
is null and void. Phil. & R. Co. v. McKibbin, 243 U. S.
264; Gray v. Stuart, 74 Va. 351; Haddock v. Haddock,
201 U. S. 562; Knapp v. Wallace, 50 Ore. 348. The statute in question must be construed as affecting only such
corporations as are still doing business within the State,
since to construe it otherwise would be to extend the
laws. of Virginia beyond her borders. St. Clair v. Cox,
106 U. S. 350.
The petitioner was a bona fide purchaser for value
under circumstances which exclude any suggestion of
fraud either actual or constructive, and was entitled to
purchase the property it obtained from the Southern Express Company without regard to the latter's creditors.
Hollins v. Briarfield Coal Co., 150 U. S. 371; McDonald
v. Williams, 174 U. S. 397.
Mr. CadwalladerJ. Collins for the respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDs

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Following an agreement of June, 1918, by the Adams
Express Company, American Express Company, Southern
Express Company (a Georgia corporation) and Wells
Fargo & Company, the principal concerns then engaged
in express transportation throughout the Union, the
American Railway Express Company was incorporated
under the laws of Delaware and, by issuing its capital
stock, acquired, July 1, 1918, all property of those carriers
theretofore utilized in connection with such business.
The Southern Express Company owned no other property
located in Virginia. After this transfer it retired from the
State; but in New York continued to hold valuable assets,
including the stock of petitioner so received, and was
solvent.

Opinion of the Court.

September 15, 1919, respondent sued the Southern Company in the Norfolk Circuit Court for the value of goods
intrusted to it in 1917 for transportation from Richmond
to Norfolk, Va., and lost. Summons was executed by delivering a copy to the Chairman of the State Corporation
Commission and transmitting another to the defendant by
mail. A special plea challenged the validity of the service
upon the ground that the defendant had withdrawn from
the State and was no longer a foreign corporation doing
business there within the meaning of the Code provisions
printed in the margin.* This special plea was overruled;
defendant failed to plead further, and judgment went by
default May 15, 1920.
July, 1922, respondent here sued petitioner for the
amount of the above-described judgment upon the theory
* Section 1294g, subsec. 2-3, Virginia Code 1904-

(2) Every such corporation, company, association, person or partnership shall, by a written power of attorney, appoint some person
residing in this State its agent, upon whom may be served all lawful
process against such corporation, company, association, person or
partnership, and who shall be authorized to enter an appearance in
its or his behalf. A copy of such power of authority, duly certified
and authenticated, shall be filed with the State Corporation Commission, and copies thereof, duly certified by the clerk of the said commission, shall be received as evidence in all courts of this State.
(3) If any such agent shall be removed, resign, die, become insane,
or otherwise incapable of acting, it shall be the duty of such corporation, company, association, person, or partnership, to appoint another
agent in his place, as prescribed by the preceding section. And until
such appointment is made, or during the absence of such agent of any
such corporation, company, association, person or partnership, from
the State, or if no such agent be appointed as prescribed by the preceding section, service of process may be upon the chairman of the
State Corporation Commission, with like effect as upon the agent
appointed by the company. The officer serving such process upon the
chairman of the State Corporation Commission shall immediately
transmit a copy thereof, by mail, to such corporation, company,
association, person, or partnership, and state such fact in his return.

that under the narrated circumstances the latter became
liable for outstanding obligations of the Southern Company contracted in Virginia. After a full and fair hearing
the trial court gave judgment therefor. The Special
Court of Appeals affirmed this action. 141 Va. 602.
What we have said in American Railway Express Co. v.
Commonwealth of Kentucky, ante, p. 269, is enough
to dispose of all material points raised here except the
claim that the judgment against the Southern Express
Company was void because not based on proper service of
process; and that is without merit. Evidently the statute
might reasonably be construed as intended to designate
an agent upon whom process should be served in suits
growing out of transactions within the State where the
corporation had failed so to do. The state court gave the
statute that effect, and we are bound by the result.
