v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 305. Argued October 4, 5, 1926.-Decided February 28, 1927.

1. The evidence sustains findings that the making of the leases and
contracts involved herein was dominated by the Secretary of the
Interior, acting collusively with the representative of the two defendant oil companies; that the Secretary of the Navy took no
active part in the negotiations; and that the leases and contracts
were procured by corruption and fraud. P. 498.
2. The finding that the Secretary of the Navy signed the documents
under misapprehension and without full knowledge of their contents
is not sustained. An opposite finding is required by the record.
P. 498.
3. In a suit by the United States to annul contracts made throuih its
officials with private corporations, the bona fides of which had been
investigated by a committee of the Senate, statements made to the
committee by the companies' representative, who voluntarily appeared in defense of their interests, showing that he gave money to
one of the officials who dominated the procurement and participated in the execution of the contracts, were admissible against the
defendant corporations in proof of fraud. P. 498.
So held where he who made the statements was the representative of both companies in procuring the contracts; was at that
time president of one company and chairman of the board of
directors of the other, having been its president also; controlled
both companies through stock ownership; and was chairman of
both boards of directors when he testified.

4. A lease of the land of a naval reserve and related contracts, which
were procured by private corporations as the result of collusion and
corrupt conspiracy between their representative and a high government official who, under an executive order, dominated the administration of the reserve, may be avoided by the United States without regard to whether money paid the official by the representative
constituted bribery as defined in the Criminal Code, or whether the
official was financially interested in the transaction, or the United
States suffered or was liable to suffer any financial loss or disadvantage as a result of the contracts and leases. It is enough if the
official's interest and dominating influence were corruptly obtained.
It was shown that he so favored the lease and cont-acts that he
could not loyally serve the interests of the United States. P. 500.
5. The Secretary of the Navy was not empowered by the Appropriation Act of June 4, 1920, to enter into contracts involving the leasing of all the unleased land of a naval petroleum reserve, and providing for the use of the crude oil, to be derived by the United
States as royalties under such leases, for the acquisition of extensive
storage facilities filled with fuel oil for the Navy. Pp. 501, 502, 508.
6. Under the proviso of the Naval Appropriation Act of June 4, 1920,
the authority of the Secretary of the Navy to provide facilities in
which to "store" naval reserve petroleum or its products did not
extend beyond those that might be provided by use of the money
made available by that act. P. 509.
7. While the general principles of equity are applicable in a suit by
the United States to secure the cancelation of a conveyance or the
rescission of a contract, they will not be applied to frustrate the
purpose of its laws or to thwart public policy. P. 505.
8. In this suit brought by the United States to set aside illegal and
fraudulent leases and contracts, which were made for the purpose of
circumventing its laws and defeating its policy for the conservation
of its naval petroleum reserves, the United States does not stand on
the footing of an individual suing to annul a deed for fraud; its
position is not that of a mere seller or lessor of land; the purpose is
to vindicate the policy mentioned, the financial element being secondary; the defendants are wrong-doers, and have no equity to
reimbursement for their expenditures as a condition to the granting
of the relief sought by the Government. Pp. 503, 508.

9. In a suit by the United States to set aside for illegality and fraud
leases made, in contravention of the policy of conserving naval
petroleum reserves, and contracts made, as part of the same transaction, for erection of oil storage facilities for the Navy, not authorized by Congress, on land of the United States and for storing
them with fuel oil, equity does not exact as a condition to the
relief prayed that the defendants be compensated for the cost to
them, or the value to the Government, of the construction work
performed or fuel oil furnished under the contracts, or for the
amount they expended in drilling or operating oil wells or in other

any, must depend on Congress. Pp. 503, 508.

CERTIORARI (270 U. S. 640) to a decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which affirmed in part and in part
reversed a decree of the District Court (6 F. (2d) 43), in
a suit by the United States to cancel two leases of land
in a naval petroleum reserve, and two contracts for erecting storage facilities and supplying fuel oil for the Navy.
The bill also prayed an account. The decree of the District Court canceled the leases and contracts for fraud
and illegality, but, in the accounting, allowed credits to
the two corporations for their expenditures under the
leases and contracts, with interest. The Circuit Court
of Appeals denied such credits, but in other respects affirmed the decree.

Argument for Petitioners.

Under the Act of June 4, 1920, the Secretary of the
Navy had authority to make the exchange contracts and
the leases. This was a special enactment, complete in
itself, relating to a subject which was not included in the
general leasing act, and simply placed in the form of a
proviso for legislative convenience, or for some other
reason which does not affect its meaning and scope.
Amer. Express Co. v. United States, 212 U. S. 522; I. C. C.
v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25; C. & P. Tel. Co. v. Manning, 186
U. S. 238. The Act contains within itself a complete and
comprehensive legislative scheme to repose exclusive control in the Secretary of the Navy as to all matters in
connection with naval reserve affairs. The entire responsibility for the handling of these naval reserves was
vested in him, and he was given full discretion.
He could theoretically leave them as they were and
take chances with regard both to the loss of oil from adjacent drilling and as to the unavailability of petroleum
products for naval use when needed. This is covered by
the use of the word "conserve " in its narrow sense. This
was not what Congress had primarily in mind, because
it could have been accomplished without any new legislation; and the law had been passed with the idea that
active and not inactive methods should be thereafter
pursued in order to protect both the oil reserves and the
strategic interests of the United States Navy. The word
"conserve" must be construed together with the other
language used-and is immediately followed by the words
"develop, use and operate." Hence, it is submitted to
be clear that an active conservation and not merely a
passive conservation was intended by Congress, and that
Congress recognized that truest conservation of oil which
was intended for the use of the Navy might well be accomplished by operating and developing the oil fieldsusing them-getting the oil to the surface either by lease,
development, contract-or otherwise taking such steps

273 U. S.

that this oil should be transmuted into something which
the Navy could actually consume, and so locating it that
when necessary it would be available for naval service.
The word "develop " can have but one meaning as
applied to oil territory, and that is to cause oil to be produced from that territory. The Secretary could do this
directly by hiring drillers and organizing a field force, if
he saw fit, which would be an "operation" of the property. Or he could develop the same property indirectly
or by contract-that is to say, by hiring the services of
skilled oil men to do the necessary work and produce all
oil possible, for the account and risk of the United States.
Or he could "lease" all or any part of this property.
To emphasize the extent of his discretion as to how these
lands should be handled, the words "or otherwise" are
added after the specific words hereinbefore mentioned.
As to the leasing power, it is absolutely unlimited and
unconditional. There is no limit as to the area which
could be leased in any or all of the reserves. In this
respect the statute is notably different from certain of
the sections of the law of February 25, 1920, in which
definite limitations were placed upon the power of the
Secretary of the Interior to lease lands. The contrast
between these two laws is so clear that it is inconceivable
that Congress intended to hamper the Secretary of the
Navy with any such limitations as to areas as those by
which the Secretary of the Interior was bound under
portions of the prior statute. Nor is the Secretary of
the Navy limited as to the time for which any lease might
be made.
There is no limitation as to the terms and conditions,
as to royalty or otherwise, which may be introduced in
any lease made by the Secretary of the Navy. Here
again this law differs notably from certain provisions of
the Leasing Act. There is no limitation as to the purpose for which leases shall be made, except that they

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 461
456

Argument for Petitioners.

must be, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy,
"for the benefit of the United States." There is no condition fixing any particular set of circumstances or motives or reasons which must exist in order to give the
Secretary of the Navy power to make any such lease.
On behalf of the plaintiff it is urged that the power
given the Secretary of the Navy to "conserve, develop,
use and operate" the lands in the naval petroleum reserves "in his discretion, directly or by contract, lease or
otherwise," is limited by an implied condition that such
development and operation could only be undertaken if
drainage from outside sources was threatened. We submit that to so hold would be to write into the law a limitation and condition which it does not contain, and
which if thus written in would absolutely prevent the
taking out of oil from the land at times when, even if no
drainage danger existed, the oil was needed either for the
present or the future operations of the Navy.
Plaintiff's counsel further contend that the law did not
give the Secretary of the Navy any power to establish,
above ground, reserves of petroleum products, but only
permitted him, if and when he had any available oil, to
"use the oil for current use or exchange it for current
use oil." Any such attempted limitation is inconsistent
with the reserve idea for national defense embodied in the
designation "Naval Reserves." Any such limitation
would at once strike down one of the important strategical and practical purposes for which these reserves were
to be created, i. e., to create something which would not
merely theoretically, but practically, be available for the
uses of the Navy at such time as its exigencies might require. As a practical matter, if this construction were
adopted, where would the line be drawn?
The Secretary had the right to lease if he believed that
the development of the property and the taking of the
oil by means of a lease, would operate to the best in-

terests of the Navy, either by the establishment of an
above-ground reserve of fuel oil, into which the crude
might be exchanged, or otherwise. His discretion will
not be reviewed by the courts. Ness v. Fisher, 223 U. S.
683.
The power to exchange: The word "exchange" is
clearly the most important word in this branch of the
statute, so far as the practical operation of the statute
for the benefit of the Navy itself is concerned. For, remembering that under the former law royalty oils must
always be sold, but that this would immediately make the
operation of the naval reserves a commercial proposition,
rather than a Navy fuel proposition, obviously the only
way in which any royalty oils could be turned to account for naval benefit under the terms of the Act was
by the exercise of the power to exchange them for other
things.
The Act as originally drawn contained the word "refine" so as to give the Secretary power to "use, refine,"
etc., but in its final form as adopted the word "refine"
was stricken out. This left, as the sole and only mode
by which royalty oils could be turned to account for
naval purposes, the exercise of the exchange power. The
well recognized meaning of "exchange" contains no limitation whatsoever as to the character or quality of the
things which may be the subject of the exchange, or the
terms or conditions of the contract. The only requisite
is that the subject matter must be property other than
money. Postal Tel. Co. v. R. R. Co., 248 U. S. 471;
B. & 0. R. R. v. Western Union, 241 Fed. 170; 23 Cor.
Jur. 186-7; Words and Phrases, 1st series, p. 2546. There
is no logical basis for limiting the exchange practice to
current fuel oil or to facilities for the storage of royalty
oils only.
The court holds that the Secretary may exchange royalty oil for fuel oil, but qualifies this by insisting that

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 463
456

Argument for Petitioners.

he must intend this fuel oil for current use. And the
court also holds that the Secretary had power to exchange
royalty oil for storage facilities, but again qualifies this
by saying that these storage facilities must be intended
"for the storage of royalty oils." We submit that distinctions of this nature have no basis in the law or in
logic. There is but one logical limitation of the exchange
power contained in these general words, and that is that
it must be exercised in the discretion of the Secretary for
some purpose not merely relating to the Navy Department as an entirety, but related to the Naval Reserve,
petroleum and petroleum products problems of the Navy
Department.
The power to store: The power to acquire storage
facilities as well as petroleum products through the exercise of the exchange power is directly within the many
cases holding that, where a particular power is granted,
everything necessary to carry out the power and make it
effective and complete will be implied from the language
of the statute. Tel. Co. v. Eyser, 19 Wall. 427; Wilson
v. Bank, 103 U. S. 778; Dooley v. Railroad, 250 Fed. 143:
Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 658; and other cases.
To deny that this power was granted by the express use
of the word "store," as well as by the necessary and
proper interpretation of the word " exchange" as an incidental thereto, would be to limit the exchange power
to cases and places where containers already exist-a construction which, in view of the comprehensive plan to
administer the Naval Reserves and to supply the needs of
the Navy as to fuel and other petroleum products, would
simply defeat and not effectuate the clear intent of Congress.
The idea of an available fuel reserve was one of the
ideas which led to the passage of the statute. The question of the proper interpretation of the statute cannot be
affected by the amount of royalty oil which the Secretary
may determine to exchange for fuel oil and its containers.

OCTOBER TERM, 1026.
Argument for Petitioners.

273 U. S.

The appropriation clause does not limit the power of
the Secretary of the Navy under the Act, except in the
expenditure of cash. This appropriation was not intended as a limitation upon any power, but solely as an
aid to the execution of such powers as might require the
use of cash. Even under the Circuit Court of Appeals'
interpretation of this clause, the $500,000 cannot be the
final limit, because in a proper case it could be renewed
and re-renewed under the last clause of the statute by
being reimbursed out of any other "proper appropriations." The clause refers to the "use" of royalty oil for
fuel and the use of a part of some fuel appropriation to
reimburse the $500,000 appropriation if some part has
been spent. The draftsman of the clause doubtless had
in mind the possibility that the Secretary might himself
refine some of the royalty oil and use for current consumption a part of the products therefrom, in which case
he would be saving the Government a part of the cash
appropriation which otherwise would be called upon to
furnish fuel for the Navy.
The contracts of April 25 and December 11, 1922, were
intended to be and were exchange contracts within the
meaning of the law. This is true despite the provisions
thereof by which the quantities of crude oil and fuel oil
to be delivered were made variable in cases of variance of
the reference prices of these two commodities. Postal

Fed. 914; Chicago R. R. Co. v. Postal Tel. Co., 245 Fed.
592. If the Court should hold that this transaction presented any of the elements of a sale, then the plaintiff
is no nearer success; for the reason that the plaintiff
would have also proved that such a sale, even though the
price is payable in property or rights, was likewise within
the power of the Secretary to make. The statute as to

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 465
456

Argument for Petitioners.

payment of cash into the Treasury applies only if there
is cash.
The power to lease naval reserve lands, conferred by
the Act of June 4, 1920, supports the contracts as well as
the leases in suit. The Secretary could have agreed that
the consideration to the Government under any lease
should be fuel oil, a refined product of crude oil, rather
than the oil in its crude state at the time of original production; and that as part of the consideration from the
lessee to the Government the former should provide storage tanks or other necessary improvements on the reserves. There was nothing in the law to prevent the
Secretary from making the lease of December 11th upon
consideration of a percentage of crude oil produced from
the leased lands by the lessee, and a specified quantity of
fuel oil and other pertroleum products in storage. In his
judgment, exercising the discretion committed to him by
law, it was "for the benefit of the United States" to
lease, upon the above mentioned considerations, the lands
in Naval Reserve No. 1. That judgment is unreviewable.
Ness v. Fisher,223 U. S. 683.
The contracts of April 25 and December 11, 1922, are
not void because providing for the establishment of a
new naval fuel depot without express authority from
Congress. They only provided for an enlargement of an
existing fuel depot and not the establishment of a new
one. It was nothing more than an amplification of a
previously established fuel depot. The Act of June 4,
1920, gave the Secretary absolute power to provide for
the construction of such storage tanks as he might see
fit, whether these were constructed in connection with the
depot already established or at a new depot. If these new
tanks could not have been constructed without the prior
express approval of Congress, then the Secretary could
not have used any of the $500,000 general appropriation
contained in the Act for the construction of a storage

tank at any place whatsoever unless Congress had passed
a subsequent act approving the particular location for
the tank.
The contracts were not invalidated by reason of any
lack of public advertisement. Neither § 3709 Rev. Stats.,
nor any other general law of the United States provides
that competitive bidding or public advertisement should
take place in cases of acquisition of property through exchange contracts. There are no general statutes requiring public advertisements as to sales. None of the statutes has anything to do with exchanges, which are covered by entirely different rules, and which would not
usually be the subject of competitive bidding. In the
absence of express statutory requirement, no competitive bidding is necessary in connection with governmental contracts. Price v. Fargo 24 N. D. 440; Crowder
v. Sullivan, 128 Ind. 486. The Act of June 4, 1920, vested
in the Secretary ample discretion to enter into contracts
pursuant to such methods as seemed to him best. This
special statute contains the only measure of his authority,
and general enactments contained in prior laws have no
bearing in such case. Fowler v. United States, 3 Ct. Cls.

Congress had intended to limit the inclusive provisions of
the Act, it would have so provided in the law itself.
The Secretary was not required to resort to competitive bidding as a condition precedent to the making of
the leases of June 5 and December 11, 1922. Teapot
Dome Lease Case, 5 F. (2d) 330; United States v. Belridge Oil Co., D. C. S. D. Cal., July 17, 1925, unreported;

Contracts, p. 159.
The Secretary of the Navy, in connection with the
contracts and leases involved, exercised the power conferred upon him by the Act of June 4, 1920.
The District Court found that the Secretary of the
Navy did not in fact really make the contracts which in
law he was authorized to make. The Circuit Court of
Appeals did not approve or even discuss this finding of
fact. Assuming the legal power of the Secretary of the
Navy, then if he in fact exercised it, the instruments here
in suit are unassailable. There was no claim in the
courts below and there can be none here, that he was
party to any conspiracy, to the commission of any fraud,
that he was bribed or that on the subject of these contracts there was any misrepresentation made to him, any
deceit practiced upon him, or any improper influence exerted over him, by Secretary Fall, on the one hand, or
by any person connected with these defendants, on the
other. The record is bare of any representations of any
kind made by Secretary Fall to Secretary Denby in connection with the making of these contracts. And this
statement is true as regards any and every officer of the
Navy Department who had any connection with, or performed any duty in relation to, these contracts or the
departmental plans, decisions, or negotiations which
brought about their making.

Secretary Fall did not make, or dominate the making
of, the contracts and leases in suit.
The contracts were not invalid because of any illegal
delegation to the Secretary of the Interior of discretionary powers which could only be exercised by the Secretary of the Navy. The discretion which cannot be delegated is the discretion which involves the exercise of
original power as to whether or not a public enterprise
shall be undertaken. Such element of discretion as is
involved in the performance of merely executive and
business acts does not go to the essence of the matter
and is not within any such prohibition. Cass County v.

An executory contract containing a void clause-unauthorized and ultra vires-may be modified by the parties so that the clause is no longer operative. The rights
of the defendants under the leases do not depend upon
whether the Secretary of the Interior could be delegated
as the agent to carry out the intent of the preferential
right clauses, which were not essential parts of the contracts. A contract is not affected by a clause which, although void in itself, is of such a nature that it does not
appear that the contract would not have been made without it. United States v. Bradley, 10 Pet. 343; Navigation

There is no merit in the contention that there must
have been a conspiracy because of the "secrecy" in connection with the transactions here involved.
The loan of $100,000 by Mr. Doheny to Mr. Fall in

and not a bribe; and it was not proved by any evidence

fluence or power in connection with the making of these
contracts and leases.
Nobody can read the record without being impressed
with the constant activity of Fall in these matters, with
the fact that whenever any critical situation arose Fall
stepped in, and that it was his final say which made it
possible for any of these papers to be placed before Secretary Denby for his signature; that always they went to
Denby from Fall through Robison, and never direct, and
that Robison, as the trial court has found, was so obsessed with getting storage facilities built with royalty
oil rather than with appropriations by Congress that he
was facile to do Fall's bidding and to bring about what
he wanted by whatever means Fall suggested and approved. It will not do for a company whose president
had an improper financial transaction with a government
official, to say that upon the government rests the burden
of proof that that transaction was the final and efficient
cause of the execution of the contract between the company and the government. Nor will it do for it to assert
that, even if the burden remains upon it, it has carried
the burden by proving that the corrupt and improper
bargain made between its president and the government
official was ineffectual because, forsooth, that improper
financial transaction took place between the president of
the corporation and the wrong official of the government,-the one not in final control.
The moment a court is convinced by clear and indubitable proof that such a transaction occurred between a
government official and a contracting party, it will nullify
and set aside the dealings between the government and
such contracting party, in which such official participated, on the ground that they are all infected by the improper transaction, and that no court, in ease of the contracting party, will stop to appraise the effect and the
harm that has been done by such improper transaction.

Whether a "loan" or " gift," the money was paid with
a full realization that it would tend to influence Fall in
his official capacity. And it is clear that the transaction
put Fall irrevocably in Doheny's power. Such a transaction was certainly a "bargain for a benefit" and certainly tended to induce Fall to neglect, ignore, exceed or
violate his public duty. Whatever Fall's actual and legal
relation to the contracts of April and December, he was
then in fact an officer of the United States and active in
the consummation of the contracts. Any duty he sustained in this behalf was a public duty, whether he acted
de facto or de jure. In connection with appellants' contention that if Fall had not the legal power to act Doheny's transaction with him can have no effect upon the
validity of the contract, see Crocker v. United States,

prietary detriment to Mr. Doheny personally resulting
from these statements is obvious. It is likewise clear that
by claiming his constitutional privilege he made himself
as though he were dead. Under these circumstances the
statements were properly received in evidence as declarations against interest. Weber v. R. R. Co., 175 Iowa

77 Tex. 630; 3 Wigmore, Evidence, § 1456; 4 Chamberlayne, Evidence, § 2771. These statements, however, are
not the only testimony upon which the finding with regard to the $100,000 transaction rests.
The trial court properly admitted the evidence of Mrs.
Edward L. Doheny, and evidence of communications between applicants for leases and various government officials during the period covered by the negotiation and
execution of the contracts and leases in question.
Pecuniary damage to the United States was shown;
but in the absence of any such showing the decree against
the appellants was justified and required. Appellants
have entered into possession and extracted large quantities of oil, gas, and other petroleum products. This waste
not only runs into several millions of dollars, but also has
impaired the value of the leased lands by reason of the
mineral extracted therefrom. No burden rests upon the
United States to establish as a condition precedent to its
right to relief that the contracts and leases are not commercially good ones and that better ones might have been
obtained. Because of its baneful tendency, equity is
eager to do all it can to redress this kind of a fraud by a
fiduciary. United States v. Carter,217 U. S. 286; Findlay v. Pertz, 66 Fed. 427; Michoud v. Girod,4 How. 502;

court will always presume injury where favoritism was
shown to the contracting party by government officials,
and will more readily do so where, as here, there is an
admission of an enormous profit to be made out of a contract granted by private negotiation to a favored party
and where, also, performance under the contract shows
that the expected profits will, in all probability, be
realized.
The Act of June 4, 1920, did not authorize, the execution of the contracts and leases. The purpose of the Act
was to enlarge the powers of the Secretary of the Navy
so that he might at will provide adequate protection
against drainage where such was needed. The underground reserve idea had been in well known effect in
the case of reserves Nos. 1 and 2 since their withdrawal
by President Taft in 1912. It was impliedly ratified by
Congress in 1920, in that the Leasing Act of February
25, 1920, conferred a right to lease land in the naval reserves only where there were already producing wells and
in compromise of valid existing claims. Had Congress
intended or expected a sharp departure from this established policy presumably some definite indication to that
effect would be found in the Act of June 4th. Instead,
this short enactment, which is itself a mere rider to the
Naval Appropriation Act for the fiscal year 1921, begins
its operative language with reference to the naval re-

serves by the word "conserve."
The further language
of the Act does give the Secretary of the Navy an unrestricted power as to how much of the lands he shall
lease. We think, however, that it shows an assumption
on the part of Congress that this power was needed, and
presumably therefore would be exercised, for more adequately protecting the reserves against drainage from
neighboring drillers.
That this would render advisable development of certain portions of the land by leases under which royalty
oils would accrue to the United States, and that such
oils, or part of them, would be sold, is apparent from the
Act. From the sales of royalty oil a sum of $500,000 is
made available to enable the Secretary to carry out the
necessary development and storage which might be incident to protection of the reserves. This was a reasonable provision for such purpose if Congress contemplated
only such development as was needed for protection.
It was a wholly and ridiculously insignificant appropriation if Congress contemplated that the Secretary of the
Navy would suddenly throw the reserves open to unlimited exploitation. There were, in all, three petroleum
reserves with a total acreage of nearly eighty thousand
acres, and in addition two shale-oil reserves. Had Congress anticipated the full development of such a vast and
rich reservoir of oil, some indication of that expectation
and some provision for the disposal of the resulting products or money would be found in the Act; something on
such a subject would have found its way into the debates
of Congress or the reports of committees.
If we look to departmental construction of the purpose
of the Act, we find that the established policy of an
underground reserve was rigidly adhered to. Not until
Secretary Fall kindled the imagination of certain enthusiasts in the Navy Department in the summer of 1921,
with the idea of an exchange for storage proposition, did
the thought occur to anyone even to investigate as to

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 479
456

Argument for the United States.

whether the Act permitted such a policy. Further, the
record shows that down to the very end of all the transactions here involved, the Secretary of the Navy maintained a fixed purpose of leasing only where such leasing
was required as a protective measure. Robison knew this
was the policy of his chief and the policy of Congress.
Prior to the Act of June 4, 1920, the royalty oil accruing to the Government from compromise leases made
on Naval Reserve Lands, was, pursuant to the Leasing
Act of February 25, 1920, sold; and the receipts from
such sales were paid into the Treasury. This was the
express mandate of the Act of February 25, 1920. After
the passage of the Act of June 4, 1920, any cash received
from sales of royalty oil from leases made pursuant to it
would also go into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts (Rev. Stats. §§ 3617, 3618), providing that all
moneys received from the sale of government property,
shall be covered into the Treasury. Everyone recognized
that under the Act of June 4, 1920, the royalty crude oil
coming to the Government under any leases theretofore
made or thereafter to be made on lands in the naval reserves could be exchanged for fuel oil and other petroleum
products useable by the Navy in its current operations.
Nobody suspected or suggested apparently that the royalty oil could itself be used as a consideration for the procurement by the Navy of other physical property and
assets, until more than a year after the Act of June 4,
1920, became law.
In the latter part of 1921, Fall and Robison developed
the plan of so using royalty oil and attempted to justify
its use under the Act of June 4, 1920. This plan soon
enlarged itself into a program for the taking out of all
the petroleum in the reserves, thus reversing the policy
adopted by Congress and adhered to for many years, and
using the royalty oil coming from the lessees for the construction of structures and filling them with petroleum

480

273 U. S.

products useable by the Navy. The expedient was
adopted of "exchanging" the crude oil for so-called reserve fuel oil and petroleum products, and, as an ancillary matter, "exchanging" this royalty crude oil also,
and in addition, under construction contracts for the
building of naval fuel depots in which the fuel oil and
petroleum products acquired were to be stored at various
points in the United States and its possessions.
Not only was the Act passed in pursuance of a conservation policy, but, disregarding all other statutory and
constitutional provisions, and supposing it stood alone,
it does not confer an authority for the making of the contracts under attack. "To use" connotes consumption,
but when we examine the last two provisos of the Act,
we find the "use" specifically limited. The one proviso
appropriates "not exceeding $500,000" of the moneys
turned in or to be turned into the Treasury from royalties on Naval Reserve lands prior to July 1, 1921, "for
this purpose." So that any "use" that is to be made
of the oil must not cost in excess of that sum. The other
proviso makes clear that "use " means "consumption"
for it requires that the $500,000 appropriation shall be
"reimbursed from the proper appropriations, on account
of the oil and gas products from said properties used by
the United States at such rate not to exceed the market
value of the oil as the Secretary of the Navy may direct."
It is, therefore, clear that if the Government "uses" this
oil for any purpose for which Congress has appropriated
money for the purchase of oil, such appropriation must
be debited and the appropriation made in the Act of June
4, 1920, must be credited with the value of the royalty
oil so "used."
The power to "store" covers both royalty crude oil and
products of the royalty oil. There are certain products,
such as gasoline and gas, which are obtained from royalty
crude oil. As the Secretary is given power to operate the

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 481
456

Argument for the United States.

reserves by contract or otherwise, he might make a contract whereby the operator would turn over to him crude
oil and products of the crude oil, which he might store.
What may be spent for this purpose? The answer is
found in the next proviso. There is "made available"
"not exceeding $500,000" "for this purpose." Moreover, these contracts are not for the storage of "the oil
and gas products" of the naval reserve lands, nor for the
storage of the "products" of such oil and gas.
The "exchange " contemplated was limited to fuel oil
and other derivatives of petroleum. It could riot extend
to the acquisition of anything which might be of benefit
to the United States. In holding that it did so extend,
the Judge Advocate General of the Navy fell into grave
error. He held the word to be unlimited.
The transactions under the contracts of April 25 and
December 11, 1922, are not in fact exchanges within the
meaning of the Act. Not only the nature of the transaction, but the language used by the parties, shows that
they realized a sale was being consummated, and not
an exchange. The legal concept of an exchange as distinguished from a sale is a transaction whereby little or
no emphasis is placed upon value; whereby the parties
intend to trade one specific article for another specific
article or articles of property. When the element of
value creeps in as a primary consideration we have a sale
and purchase rather than an exchange. The power "to
sell" was to sell for a money consideration only.
The Act itself, by an appropriation, provides the
means of storage. The following acts: Rev. Stats. §§
3732, 3733; 1906, c. 3078, 34 Stat. 255; 1906, c. 3914,
34 Stat. 764, § 9, forbid any contract being entered into,
such as those in issue in this case, which will bind the
Government to pay a larger sum than the amount in
the Treasury appropriated for the specific purpose, un4247o-27-31

less the Act shall in specific terms declare that such contract may be executed. Sutton v. United States, 256
U. S. 575; Hooe v. United States, 218 U. S. 322; Chazse
v. United States, 155 U. S. 489; Bradley v. United States,
98 U. S. 104, are typical cases showing that this Court
construes this matter strictly and never from a general
authority to contract or to do a certain act conferred
upon an executive official draws the conclusion that the
policy of Congress touching the limitation of projects by
appropriation was intended to be overruled or an exception created. The last proviso requires the appropriation
of $500,000 to be reimbursed from the proper appropriation on account of the use of the royalty oil. The appropriation of $500,000 is itself an appropriation for the
procurement of storage.
The contracts were violative of the law as to the location and establishment of fuel depots. The power to
establish depots of coal and other fuel was delegated to
the Secretary of the Navy under the Act of August 31,
1842, 5 Stat. 577, which later became Rev. Stats. § 1552.
This delegation was subsequently revoked. Act of March
4, 1913, 37 Stat. 898. See House Report, 62d Cong., 3d
Sess. In appropriation acts from 1914 onward, the various fuel depot projects are specifically mentioned and a
separate appropriation is made for each.. Upon the repeal of Rev. Stats. § 1552, the exclusive authority to locate and establish fuel depots was revested in Congress
by virtue of the Constitution.
The contracts of April 25 and December 11, 1922, were
not made by advertisement and competitive bidding, as
required by law. Rev. Stats. § 3709; United States v.
Purcell Co., 249 U. S.313; United States v. Ellicott, 223

The provisions of the contracts and leases constituted
an illegal attempt to delegate the power conferred upon
the Secretary of the Navy by the Act of June 4, 1920.
The trial court held that the Executive Order, so far as
it attempted to transfer the administration of the reserves
to the Secretary of the Interior and pass over to him discretionary powers vested in the Secretary of the Navy,
was void and of no effect. We understand that counsel
for appellants concur in this view. By the contract of
April 25, 1922, the Secretary of the Navy purported to
transfer the procurement of fuel oil and of storage tankage therefor, dredging, docking, etc., at the Pearl Harbor
Naval Station to the Secretary of the Interior. He further purported to transfer the entire administration over
half of Naval Reserve No. 1 and its leasing to the Secretary of the Interior. Under the contract and lease of
December 11, 1922, no power of any kind is left in the
Secretary of the Navy.
The United States is not estopped to have these contracts rescinded because they have been executed. Filor

discretionary powers have been vested by law, to delegate
them is well settled. Light Co. v. Dunn, 62 Cal. 580;

the expressed will of the legislative branch of the Government and on their face utterly null and void.
The companies are not entitled to be credited with
their respective disbursements under the fraudulent and
illegal contracts and leases. Allowance of credit for the
Pearl Harbor project would be subversive of the "fuel
depot" policy of the United States and in violation of
the law of illegal public contracts. This Court has repeatedly held that the equitable maxim, "He who seeks
equity must do equity," should have no place in an
equitable proceeding brought by the United States to
enforce a public statute and its underlying policy.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This suit was brought by the United States in the
northern division of the southern district of California
against the petitioners, Pan American Petroleum and
Transport Company and Pan American Petroleum Company. The former will be called the Transport Company
and the latter the Petroleum Company. The relief
sought is the cancelation of two contracts with the Transport Company, dated April 25, and December 11, 1922,
and two leases of lands in Naval Petroleum Reserve No.
1, to the Petroleum Company, dated June 5 and December 11, 1922, an injunction, the appointment of receivers,
and an accounting. The complaint alleges that the con-

tracts and leases were obtained and consummated by
means of conspiracy, fraud and bribery, and that they
were made without authority of law. Receivers were
appointed to take possession of and operate the properties
pending the suit. At the trial the court heard much evidence and later made findings of fact; stated its conclusions of law; announced an opinion, 6 F. (2d) 43, and
entered its decree. It adjudged the contracts and leases
void and ordered them canceled; it directed the Petroleum
Company to surrender the lands and equipment, and
stated an account between the United States and each
of the companies. The Transport Company was charged
the value of petroleum products received by it and the
amount of profits derived upon their resale, and was given
credit for the actual cost of construction work performed
and of fuel oil delivered under the contracts. The Petroleum Company was charged the value of the petroleum
products taken under the leases and given credit for actual
expenditures in drilling and operating wells and making
other useful improvements. Interest was added to each
of the items. The companies appealed to the Circuit
Court of Appeals, and the United States took a cross
appeal. That court affirmed the decree so far as its
awards affirmative relief to the United States and reversed
that part which gives credit to the companies. 9 F. (2d)

Under R. S. §§ 2319, 2329, and the Act of February 11,
1897, c. 216, 29 Stat. 526, public lands containing oil were
open to settlement, exploration and purchase. Exploration and location were permitted without charge, and title
could be obtained for a nominal amount. United States
v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459, 466. Prior to the
autumn of 1909 large areas of public land in California
were explored; petroleum was found, patents were obtained, and large quantities of oil were taken. In September of that year, the director of the Geological Survey

Opinion of the Court.

reported that, at the rate oil lands in California were
being patented, all would be taken within a few months.
and that, in view of the increased use of fuel oil by the
Navy, there appeared to be immediate need for conservation. Then the President, without specific authorization of Congress, by proclamation withdrew from disposition in any manner specified areas of public lands in
California and Wyoming amounting to 3,041,000 acres.
By the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847, Congress
expressly authorized the President to withdraw public
lands containing oil, gas and other minerals. An executive order of July 2, 1910, confirmed the withdrawals
then in force. By a later order, September 2, 1912, the
President directed that some of these lands "constitute
Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 and shall be held for
the exclusive use or benefit of the United States Navy
until this order is revoked by the President or by Act of
Congress." This Reserve includes all the lands involved
in this suit. By a similar order, December 13, 1912, the
President created the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 2.
The Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat.
437, regulates the exploration and mining of public lands,
and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant
permits for exploration and make leases covering oil and
gas lands, exclusive of those withdrawn or reserved for
military or naval purposes. The Act of June 4, 1920,
c. 228, 41 Stat. 812, 813, appropriated $30,000 to be used,
among other things, for investigating fuel for the Navy
and the availability of the supply allowed by naval reserves in the public domain. It contains the following:
"Provided, That the Secretary of the Navy is directed
to take possession of all properties within the naval petroleum reserves . . . to conserve, develop, use, and
operate the same in his discretion, directly or by contract,
lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or sell
the oil and gas products thereof, and those from all roy-

alty oil from lands in the naval reserves, for the benefit
And provided further,
.
of the United States:
That such sums as have been or may be turned into the
Treasury of the United States from royalties on lands
within the naval petroleum reserves prior to July 1, 1921,
not to exceed $500,000, are hereby made available for
this purpose until July 1, 1922: Provided further, That
this appropriation shall be reimbursed from the proper
appropriations on account of the oil and gas products from
said properties used by the United States at such rate,
not in excess of the market value of the oil, as the Secretary of the Navy may direct."
March 5, 1921, Edwin Denby became Secretary of the
Navy and Albert B. Fall, Secretary of the Interior. May
31, 1921, the President promulgated an executive order
purporting to commit the administration and conservation
of all oil and gas bearing lands in the Reserves to the
Secretary of the Interior, subject to the supervision of the
President.
The contract, dated April 25, 1922, was executed on
behalf of the United States by the Acting Secretary of the
Interior and by the Secretary of the Navy. The Transport Company agreed to furnish at the Naval Station at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, 1,500,000 barrels of fuel oil and
deliver it into storage facilities there to be contructed by
the company according to specifications of the Navy. The
Company was to receive its compensation in crude oil to
be taken from the Reserves. The quantity, on the basis
of the posted field prices of crude oil prevailing during the
life of the contract, was to be the equivalent of the market
value of the fuel oil and also sufficient to cover the cost of
-the storage facilities. The United States agreed to deliver
to the company at the place of production month by
month all the royalty oil furnished by lessees in Reserves
Nos. 1 and 2 until all claims under the contract were satisfied. It was stipulated that if production of crude oil

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 489
456

Opinion of the Court.

should decrease so as unduly to prolong performance,
"then the Government will, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, grant additional leases on such
lands as he may designate in naval petroleum reserve No.
1 as shall be sufficient to maintain total deliveries of
royalty oil under this contract at the approximate rate of
five hundred thousand barrels (500,000) per annum."
And, by Article XI of the contract, it was agreed that, if
during the life of the contract such additional leases should
be granted within specified areas, "the contractor shall
first be called upon by the Secretary of the Interior to
meet such drilling conditions and to pay such royalties
as the Secretary may deem just and proper, and in the
event of his acceptance . . . the contractor shall be
granted by the Government a preferential lease on such
tracts as the Secretary of the Interior may decide to lease.
In the event of the failure of the contractor to agree
then said lease or leases may be offered for competitive bidding, but the contractor shall have a right to
submit a bid on equal terms with others engaged in said
bidding."
The lease of June 5, 1922, was signed by the Assistant
Secretary of the Interior. It was made in accordance with
a letter of April 25, 1922, signed by the Acting Secretary
of the Interior and the Secretary of the Navy, and sent
to J. J. Cotter, who was Vice-President of the Transport
Company. It covered the quarter section described in
the letter. This lease was assigned to the Petroleum
Company.
The contract dated December 11, 1922, is signed for the
United States by the Secretary of the Interior and the
Secretary of the Navy. It declares that it is desired to fill
storage tanks at Pearl Harbor promptly as they are completed and also to procure additional fuel oil and other
petroleum products in storage there and elsewhere; that
the Secretary of the Navy requested the Secretary of the

490

273 T. S.

Interior as administrator of the Naval Petroleum Reserves
to arrange for such products in storage and to exchange
therefor additional royalty crude oil, "the probable cost
of the additional products and storage immediately
planned for being estimated at fifteen million dollars more
or less "; that this cannot be done on the basis of exchange
for the crude oil coming to the Government under the
present leases; that, under the contract of April 25, 1922,
the company is granted preferential right to leases to certain lands in Naval Reserve No. 1; and that the company
was planning to provide refinery facilities at Los Angeles,
together with pipe lines from the field to the refinery and
docks, and to erect storage having capacity of 2,000,000
barrels or more. The company agreed to furnish, as
directed by the Secretary of the Interior, the fuel oil in
storage at Pearl Harbor covered by the earlier contract; to
construct for actual cost additional storage facilities there,
as required, up to 2,700,000 barrels; to furnish fuel oil and
other petroleum products in the proposed storage as and
when completed on the basis of market prices plus transportation cost at going rates; to furnish without charge,
until expiration of the contract, storage for 1,000,000 barrels of fuel oil at Los Angeles; to fill it with fuel oil for
the Navy at such time as Government royalty oil should
be available for exchange, and to bunker Government
ships from such oil at cost; to maintain for 15 years subject to the demands of the Navy 3,000,000 barrels of fuel
oil in the company's depots at Atlantic Coast points; to
furnish crude oil products and storage facilities at other
points, designated by the Government, when sufficient
crude oil has been delivered to satisfy the Pearl Harbor
contract; to sell the Navy at ten per cent. less than market
price additional available fuel oil produced from the ;reserves and manufactured products from its California
refineries; to credit the Navy for crude oil at published
prices and for gas and casinghead gasoline at prices fixed

Opinion of the Court.

in the leases, and to satisfy any surplus credits of the
Government by delivery of fuel oil or other petroleum
products, by construction of additional storage facilities,
or by payment in cash as the Government might elect.
The United States agreed to deliver to the company in
exchange all royalty oil, gas, and casinghead gasoline produced on Reserves Nos. 1 and 2 until its obligations were
discharged and in any event for fifteen years after the
expiration of the contract of April 25, 1922 [which was
without specified time limit], and to lease to the company all the unleased lands in Reserve No. 1.
The lease of December 11, 1922, is signed for the United
States by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary
of the Navy. It covers all unleased lands in Reserve No.
1, but with a provision that no drilling shall be done on
approximately the western half without the lessor's consent. It runs for twenty years and so long thereafter as
oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. The royalties
range from 12 to 35 per cent.
A Joint Resolution adopted by the Senate and House
of Representatives and approved by the President, February 8, 1924, 43 Stat. 5, stated that it appeared from evidence taken by the Committee on Public Lands and Surveys of the Senate that the contract of April 25, 1922, and
the lease of December 11, 1922, were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and corruption, without
authority on the part of the officers purporting to act for
the United States and in defiance of the settled policy of
the Government to maintain in the ground a great reserve supply of oil adequate to the needs of the Navy.
It declared the contracts and leases to be against public
interest and that the lands should be recovered and held
for the purposes to which they were dedicated. And it
authorized and directed the President to cause suit to be
prosecuted for the annulment and cancelation of the lease
and all contracts incidental and supplementary thereto,

273 T. S.

and to prosecute such other action or proceedings, civil
and criminal, as might be warranted.
The findings contain what in abridged substance
follows:
E. L. Doheny controlled both companies. Fall was
active in procuring the transfer of the administration of
naval petroleum reserves from the Navy Department to
the Interior. And, after the executive order was made,
he dominated the negotiations that eventuated in the
contracts and leases. From the inception no matter of
policy or action of importance was determined without
his consent. Denby was passive throughout, and signed
the contracts and lease and the letter of April 25, 1922,
under misapprehension and without full knowledge of
their contents. July 8, 1921, Fall wrote Doheny: "There
will be no possibility of any further conflict with Navy
officials and this Department, as I have notified Secretary Denby that I should conduct the matter of naval
leases under the direction of the President, without calling any of his force in consultation unless I conferred
with himself personally upon a matter of policy. le
understands the situation and that I shall handle matters
exactly as I think best and will not consult with any
officials of any bureau in his Department, but only with
himself, and such consultation will be confined strictly
and entirely to matters of general policy." After that
Doheny and his companies acted upon the belief that
Fall had authority to make the contracts and leases.
Doheny and Fall conferred as to a proposal to be made
by the Transport Company whereby it should receive
from the United States royalty oil for constructing storage facilities at Pearl Harbor and filling them with fuel
oil. They discussed the matter of granting other leases
in Reserve No. 1. They also discussed a petition of the
Petroleum Company for reduction of royalties under an
existing lease. Fall and Admiral John K. Robison, per-

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 493
456

Opinion of the Court.

sonal representative of the Secretary of the Navy in naval
reserve matters, agreed that the proposed contract should
be kept secret so that Congress and the public should not
know what was being done. [But it is to be said that
Robison's motives in this were not the same as Fall's.]
November 28, 1921, Doheny submitted to Fall a proposal stating that, in accordance with a suggestion from
Fall, he had made inquiries as to cost of constructing
storage for 1,500,000 barrels of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor.
He gave in detail figures relating to such cost, the price
of crude oil in the field and of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor,
and stated the total amount of crude oil necessary to pay
for the tanks and fuel oil "on the basis of our being paid
for both tanks and oil in royalty crude oil produced from
lands within the naval reserves and to be leased to us."
The letter concluded: "I suppose you will turn this matter over to First Assistant Secretary Finney, who, with
Rear Admiral Robison, may arrange the details of it
during your absence, and as I also expect to be absent,
I am confidentially furnishing Mr. Cotter with the information so that he can intelligently discuss the matter
with Mr. Finney." And the next day Fall wrote Robison:
"Mr. Cotter will wait upon you with data, etc., with relation to oil tanks and royalty oils in connection with Pearl
Harbor demands. I have asked him also to hand you,
for your inspection, the original of a letter from Colonel
Doheny addressed to myself, containing a r~sume of the
data. Should you think best to accept this proposition
then of course it would be necessary, in my judgment,
to turn over to Col. Doheny, if we can do so, leases upon
further wells or area in the naval reserve in which he is
now drilling. If this is done it must be understood that
the royalty must be made less than are the present royalties being paid by the Midway and Pan American." The
letter stated that the gas pressure was lessening and that
the companies were suffering loss in the payment of the

494

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

273 U. S.

55 per cent. royalty. "If you approve the proposition.
will you kindly indicate to me such approval by simple
endorsement upon Col. Doheny's letter to myself, signed
by yourself. Your simple 0. K. will be sufficient."
Doheny had agreed to advance $100,000 to Fall as and
when he should need it. November 30, at Fall's request,
Doheny sent him $100,000 in currency. The money was
obtained in New York on the check of Doheny's son who
carried it to Washington and gave it to Fall. And Fall
sent to Doheny by the son a demand note for $100,000.
No entry of the advance was made in the accounts of
Doheny or the petitioners. Nothing has been paid on
account of principal or interest. At that time it was
understood between Doheny and Fall that the latter need
not repay it in kind. Doheny intended, if Fall did not
dispose of a certain ranch in New Mexico, to cause the
Transport Company to employ him at a salary sufficient
to enable him, out of one-half of it, to pay off the amount
in five or six years; and he knew that Fall expected to
leave the service of the Government and accept employment with one of his companies. A few weeks after it
was given, Doheny tore Fall's signature off the note so
that it would not be enforceable in the hands of others.
December 1, Fall gave instructions to subordinates that
the petition of the Petroleum Company for reduction of
royalties should not be granted but that, as relief, the
company be given another lease at regulation royalties.
Long in advance of receipt of bids Fall knew that the
Transport Company would offer to construct storage facilities at cost and to fill them with fuel oil in exchange for
royalty oil and for the assurance that other leases on lands
in Reserve No. 1 would be granted to it. Others were not
advised that the United States would consider a bid conditioned on assurance to the bidder of other leases or preferential right to leases. Due to the interest of Fall, the
Transport Company had opportunities for conference with

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 495
456

Opinion of the Court.

and advice from those acting for the United States which
were not given to others. There were five other oil companies with which officers or employees of the United
States conferred as to the proposed contract. Fall knew
that two of these would not bid because they considered
the proposed contract illegal; that two of the others had
not been invited to bid, and that the other one would
refuse to bid unless authority for the contract should be
obtained from Congress. Invitation for proposals was
sent two construction companies; but Fall understood
and stated that it was impossible for either of them to bid
because payment had to be made in royalty oil. April 13,
Fall left Washington for Three Rivers, New Mexico.
Before leaving he gave instructions that no bids should be
accepted or contract awarded without his consent. The
bids were opened April 15. Four were received; one was
conditioned upon Congressional approval of the contract;
one did not cover the construction work and applied only
to furnishing the fuel oil; the other two proposals were
from the Transport Company: one of them, designated A,
was in accordance with the invitation for bids, but the
other, called B, was not. The latter named the smaller
lump sum in barrels of crude oil; it stated that if actual
cost was less than a specified amount the saving should be
credited to the Government; and it was conditioned upon
granting the bidder preferential right to become lessee in
all leases that thereafter might be granted by the United
States for recovery of oil and gas in Reserve No. 1. On
April 18, Edward C. Finney, Acting Secretary of the
Interior, telegraphed Fall that certain officials and
employees of the United States recommended acceptance
of proposal B; on the same day Fall consented by telegram, and Finney sent a letter to the company purporting
to award the contract to it. Cotter then stated that the
Transport Company did not desire to make the contract
unless the United States would agree, within twelve

273 U.S.

months, to granT the company a lease or leases of lands in
Reserve No. 1. He also raised the question whether the
executive order of May 31, 1921, had any legal force and
refused to permit the company to make the contract
unless Denby should sign as Secretary of the Navy. April
20, Arthur W. Ambrose of the Bureau of Mines was sent
from Washington to Three Rivers with the papers in the
case. He was instructed to consult Fall as to whether
Denby should be made a party to the contract. April 23,
Fall by telegram agreed that Denby should be made a
party and directed Finney to execute the contract for the
Department of the Interior. While it is not clearly shown
that Ambrose took with him a draft of the letter of April
25, signed by Denby and Finney and sent to Cotter, lie
was instructed to, and did, consult Fall concerning it.
That letter declares that the company's proposals were the
lowest received by the Government. After stating that,
expressed in money, proposal B is the better by $235,184.40, and by the possible saving by performance for
less than the estimated cost of construction, it said: "It
is evident from our conversation of April 18 that your
interpretation of preferential right was to the effect that
the . . . Transport Co. desired the right to lease certain
specified land in naval petroleum reserve No. 1 as well as
preferential right to lease other land in naval petroleum
reserve No. 1 to the extent described in Article XI of contract. It is also my understanding from your conversation
that unless the . . . Transport Co. could get a lease to
certain lands, your company would not desire to enter into
a contract under the terms outlined in proposal (B) and
preferred the government would accept proposal (A)."
The letter then stated that the Department favored proposal B and reiterated its stated advantages over the
other proposal. Then it said: "In order that the Government may take advantage of a contract embodying the
terms outlined in proposal (B), I wish to advise you that

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 497
Opinion of the Court.

456

the Department of the Interior will agree to grant to the
. Transport Co. within one year from the date of
the delivery of a contract relative to the Pearl Harbor
project leases to drill the following tracts of land." The
letter specified the quarter section covered by the lease of
June 5, 1922, and an additional strip, and stated that the
royalties to be required would not be greater than specified rates ranging from 121/2 to 35 per cent. The preferential right was inserted to prevent competition. The
assurance that additional leases would be given was not
necessary or required under proposal B.
After the making of the contract of April 25, the posted
field price of crude oil declined rapidly. In the autumn
of 1922 the Transport Company and Doheny were in correspondence or consultation with Fall for the purpose of
at once securing additional leases in Reserve No. 1.
Doheny submitted a proposition to Fall which the latter
delivered to his subordinates with his favorable recommendation. Later Doheny enlarged the proposition, and
there followed negotiations concerning the proposed lease.
Doheny and Fall agreed upon a schedule of royalties.
The lease of December 11 was arranged without competition of any kind. Plans for the proposed construction
work had not been prepared. Before the contract and
lease were made Fall and others in his Department stated
to persons making inquiries that it was not the intention
to make leases or to drill in that Reserve. The danger of
drainage had been eliminated by agreement between the
United States and oil companies operating in the vicinity
that no drilling should be done by either except on six
months' notice to the other.
The District Court concluded that the contracts and
leases were obtained by corruption and fraud. On their
appeal, petitioners challenged practically all the findings
of the trial court. The Circuit Court of Appeals, after
42847-27----32

498

273 U.S.

stating the issue and the substance of the facts found
and conclusions reached below, said: "We find no ground
for disturbing the findings of fact which we deem essential to the decision of the case, and while the evidence
may be insufficient to support certain contested findings
the disputed facts, in view of our conclusions upon the
law applicable to the case, become of little importance."
The petitioners here argue that the Secretary of the Navy
did in fact exert the authority conferred by the Act of
June 4, 1920, and that Fall did not dominate the making
of the contracts and leases; that it was not proved by any
evidence competent or admissible against the companies
that Doheny gave Fall $100,000; that the giving of the
money did not affect the transaction; that it was a loan
and not a bribe, and that the record does not sustain the
conclusion of the District Court.
We have considered the evidence, and we are satisfied
that the findings as to the matters of fact here controverted are fully sustained, except the statement that
Denby signed the contracts and leases under misapprehension and without full knowledge of the contents of the
documents. As to that the record requires an opposite
finding. Under the Act of June 4, 1920, it was his official
duty to administer the oil reserves; he was not called as
a witness, and it is not to be assumed that he was without
knowledge of the disposition to be made of them or of the
means employed to get storage facilities and fuel oil for
the Navy. He is presumed to have had knowledge of
what he signed; there are direct evidence and proven circumstances to show that he had. But the evidence sustains the finding that he took no active part in the
negotiations, and that Fall, acting collusively with
Doheny, dominated the making of the contracts and
leases.
The finding that Doheny caused the $100,000 to be
given to Fall is adequately sustained by the evidence.

PAN -AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 499
456

Opinion of the Court.

Early in 1924, during the investigation of these contracts
and leases by the Senate Committee, Doheny voluntarily
appeared as witness and there gave testimony for the
purpose of explaining the money transaction between him
and Fall at the time the initial contract was being negotiated. At the trial of this case, over objections of the
companies, his statements before the committee were
received in evidence. Petitioners insist that they were
not admissible. But Doheny acted for both companies
when the contracts and leases were negotiated. He controlled the voting power of one that owned all the shares
of the other. He was President of the Petroleum Company up to July 24, 1922, and then became Chairman of
its board. He was President of the Transport Company
until December 7, 1923, when he became Chairman of its
board. He was Chairman of both when he testified.
There is no evidence that his control over or authority
to act for these companies was less in 1924, when he
appeared for them before the committee, than it was in
1921 and 1922, when he negotiated and executed the contracts and leases. The companies were much concerned
as to the investigation lest it might result in an effort to
set aside the transaction. The hearing before the committee was an occasion where it was proper for them to be
represented. Doheny had acted for them from the inception of the venture. The facts and circumstances disclosed by the record justified the lower courts in holding
that, when he testified before the committee, he was
acting for the companies within the scope of his authority.

The facts and circumstances disclosed by the record
show clearly that the interest and influence of Fall as
well as his official action were corruptly secured by
Doheny for the making of the contracts and leases; that,
after the executive order of May 31, 1921, Fall dominated
the administration of the Naval Reserves, and that the
consummation of the transaction was brought about by
means of collusion and corrupt conspiracy between him
and Doheny. Their purpose was to get for petitioners oil
and gas leases covering all the unleased lands in the
Reserve. The making of the contracts was a means to
that end. The whole transaction was tainted with corruption. It was not necessary to show that the money
transaction between Doheny and Fall constituted bribery
as defined in the Criminal Code or that Fall was financially interested in the transaction or that the United
States suffered or was liable to suffer any financial loss or
disadvantage as a result of the contracts and leases. It is
enough that these companies sought and corruptly
obtained Fall's dominating influence in furtherance of the
venture. It is clear that, at the instance of Doheny, Fall
so favored the making of these contracts and leases that
it was impossible for him loyally or faithfully to serve the
interests of the United States. The lower courts for that
reason rightly held the United States entitled to have
them adjudged illegal and void. Crocker v. United

Opinion of the Court.

The transaction evidenced by the contracts and leases
was not authorized by the Act of June 4, 1920. The grant
of authority to the Secretary of the Navy did not indicate
a change of policy as to conservation of the reserves. The
Act of June 25, 1910, the Act of February 25, 1920, the
executive orders, and the Joint Resolution of February
8, 1924, show that it has been and is the policy of the
United States to maintain a great naval petroleum reserve
in the ground. While the possibility of loss by drainage
might be a reason for legislation enabling the Secretary to
take any appropriate action that at any time might
become necessary to save the petroleum, it is certain that
the contracts and leases have no such purpose. The work
to be paid for in crude products contemplated the construction of fuel depots. The one covered by the first
contract was a complete unit sufficient for 1,500,000
barrels including pumping stations, fire protection and
its own wharf and channel. It is not necessary to consider
the possible extent of the construction that might be required under the later contract. Indeed it could not then
be known how much work and products in storage it
would take to exhaust the reserve. The record shows that
the Navy Department estimated the cost of proposed
storage plants and contents at approximately $103,000,000.
Congress has not authorized any such program. The Department tried and failed to secure additional appropriations for the Pearl Harbor storage facilities. The Act of
August 31, 1842, 5 Stat. 577 (R. S. § 1552), gave the Secretary authority to construct fuel depots. But it was taken
away by the Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 898. Since
that time Congress has made separate appropriations for
fuel stations at places specifically named.' And it has

purchase or for construction work in the absence of express authority and adequate appropriations therefor.

of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 764. The Secretary was not
authorized to use money received from the sale of gas
products. All such sums are required to be paid into
the Treasury. R?. S. §§ 3B17, 3618, as amended, 19 Stat.
249.
The words granting authority to the Secretary are " use,
store, exchange, or sell" the oil and gas products. As the
Secretary, among other things, was authorized until July
1, 1922, to use money out of the appropriation to "store"
oil and gas products from these lands, it will not be held,
in the absence of language clearly requiring it, that he was
also empowered without limit to use crude oil to pay for
additional storage facilities. Unless given him by "exchange" the Secretary had no power by such contracts to
locate or construct fuel depots. It is not contended that
the clause confers unlimited authority, and the petitioners
say that the word " exchange" must have some reasonable limitation. But they insist that it is broad enough to
authorize the contracts. If it is, there is no reason why
crude oil may not be used to pay for any kind of construction work or to purchase any property that may be desired
by the Department for the use of the Navy.
The purpose and scope of the provision are limited to
the administration of the reserves. The clause is found
in a proviso to an appropriation for an investigation of
fuel adapted to naval requirements and the availability
of the supply in the naval reserves. If "exchange" has

the meaning contended for by petitioners, it must be taken
to indicate that Congress intended by the clause in question not only to restore to the Secretary authority in
respect of fuel depots that had been taken from him by the
Act of March 4, 1913, but also to enable him by means of
contracts and leases such as these to reverse, if he saw fit,
the established policy of the Government as to the petroleum reserves. The circumstances of the enactment as
well as the terms of the provision indicate a purpose to
authorize exchange of crude petroleum from these reserves
for fuel oil and other petroleum products suitable for use
by the Navy. The Secretary was not authorized to refine
the crude product. A draft of the Act included that
authority, but the word "refine" was stricken out. This
made necessary the exchange of the crude product for
fuel oil and other products suitable for use. Whatever
the meaning rightly to be attributed to the words employed, it is clear that they stop short of authorizing the
Secretary to pay for improvements such as were covered
by the contracts.
The petitioners insist that, in any event, they are entitled to credit for the cost of construction work performed and of the fuel oil furnished at Pearl Harbor, and
also for the amount they expended to drill and operate
oil wells and to make other improvements on the leased
lands.

Opinion of the Court.

Transport Company delivered into the storage constructed
a specified quantity of fuel oil of value to the United
States equal to what it cost the company; that under
the supervision of Government officials the Petroleum
Company economically expended money for development of the leased lands to produce oil, gas and gasoline
and to make thereon permanent improvements that resulted in benefit to the United States equal to the amount
expended.
They maintain that, as a condition of granting the
United States the relief it claims, equity requires it to
give credit to them for their expenditures; that if this
be denied, they will be required to pay double the value
of the royalty oil they have received, and that the United
States thereby will be unjustly enriched; that, except
the balance shown by the account, they have paid in
full for such oil; that the United States has fully paid
for the benefits it received from petitioner's expenditures,
and that, in effect, it now seeks to recover the payments
it made voluntarily. And they insist that the United
States must be made to bear these amounts even if the
contracts were made without authority of law or were
tainted with fraud, violation of public policy, conspiracy
or other wrongful act.
In suits brought by individuals for rescission of contracts the maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity
is generally applied, so that the party against whom relief
is sought shall be remitted to the position he occupied
before the transaction complained of. "The court proceeds on the principle, that, as the transaction ought
never to have taken place, the parties are to be placed
as far as possible in the situation in which they would
have stood if there had never been any such transaction." Neblett v. Macfarland, 92 U. S. 101, 103. And,
while the perpetrator of the fraud has no standing to
rescind, he is not regarded as an outlaw; and, if the trans-

action is rescinded by one who has the right to do so,
"the courts will endeavor to do substantial justice so
far as is consistent with adherence to law." Stoffela v.
Nugent, 217 U. S. 499, 501. The general principles of
equity are applicable in a suit by the United States to
secure the cancelation of a conveyance or the rescission
of a contract. United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200
U. S. 321, 339; United States v. Stinson, 197 U. S.200,
204; State of Iowa v. Carr, 191 Fed. 257, 266; cf. Mason
v. United States, 260 U. S. 545, 557, et seq. But they
will not be applied to frustrate the purpose of its laws
or to thwart public policy.
Causey v. United States, 240 U. S.399, was a suit in
equity brought by the United States to recover title to
public lands conveyed to defendant under the homestead
laws. The patent was obtained by fraud. The defendant paid the United States for the land in scrip at the
rate of $1.25 per acre. The complaint did not contain
an offer to return the scrip, and it was insisted by the
defendant that, because of such failure, the suit could
not be maintained.. The court said (p. 402): "This objection assumes that the suit is upon the same plane as
if brought by an individual vendor to annul a sale of land
fraudently induced. But, as this court has said, the Government in disposing of its public lands does not assume
the attitude of a mere seller of real estate at its market
value. These lands are held in trust for all the people,
and in providing for their disposal Congress has sought
to advance the interests of the whole country by opening
them to entry in comparatively small tracts under restrictions designed to accomplish their settlement, development and utilization. And when a suit is brought
to annul a patent obtained in violation of these restrictions, the purpose is not merely to regain the title but
also to enforce a public statute and maintain the policy
underlying it. Such a suit is not within the reason of the

PAN AMERICAN CO. v. UNITED STATES. 507
456

Opinion of the Court.

ordinary rule that a vendor suing to annul a sale fraudulently induced must offer and be ready to return the consideration received. That rule, if applied, would tend to
frustrate the policy of the public land laws; and so it is
held that the wrongdoer must restore the title unlawfully
obtained and abide the judgment of Congress . as to
whether the consideration paid shall be refunded."
Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, was a suit
by the United States to cancel conveyances of allotted
lands made by members of the Cherokee Nation and to
have the title decreed to be in the allottees and their
heirs, upon the ground that the conveyances were made
in violation of restrictions upon the power of alienation.
On demurrer to the complaint it was insisted that the
allottees had received considerations for the conveyances
and should be made parties to the suit in order that equitable restoration might be enforced. The court said (p.
446): "Where, however, conveyance has been made in
violation of the restrictions, it is plain that the return of
the consideration cannot be regarded as an essential prerequisite to a decree of cancellation. Otherwise, if the
Indian grantor had squandered the money, he would lose
the land which Congress intended he should hold, and
the very incompetence and thriftlessness which were the
occasion of the measures for his protection would render
them of no avail. The effectiveness of the acts of Congress is not thus to be destroyed. The restrictions were
set forth in public laws, and were matters of general
knowledge. Those who dealt with the Indians contrary
to these provisions are not entitled to insist that they
should keep the land if the purchase price is not repaid,
and thus frustrate the policy of the statute."
United States v. Trinidad Coal Co., 137 U. S. 160, was
a suit brought by the United States to set aside patents
conveying certain coal lands on the ground that they
were obtained by fraud and in violation of R. S. §§ 2347,

2348, 2350. The company, in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme to get the lands, furnished the money that
was paid to the United States by the fraudulent patentees
who conveyed the lands to the company. The complaint
did not contain an offer by the United States to return
the money. The company contended that the United
States was subject to the rules that apply to individuals
and that relief should be conditioned upon return of the
money. The court held that the rule should not be applied in a case like that one. It laid down and applied
the principles on which rest the decisions in Causey v.
United States, supra, and Heckman v. United States,
supra. Among other things, the court said (p. 170):
"If the defendant is entitled, upon a cancellation of the
patents fraudulently and illegally obtained from the
United States, in the name of others, for its benefit, to a
return of the moneys furnished to its agents in order to
procure such patents, we must assume that Congress will
make an appropriation for that purpose, when it becomes
necessary to do so. The proposition that the defendant,
having violated a public statute in obtaining public lands
that were dedicated to other purposes, cannot be required
to surrender them until it has been reimbursed the
amount expended by it in procuring the legal title, is not
within the reason of the ordinary rule that one who seeks
equity must do equity; and, if sustained, would interfere
with the prompt and efficient administration of the public domain. Let the wrongdoer first restore what it confesses to have obtained from the government by means
of a fradulent scheme formed by its officers, stockholders
and employes in violation of law."
It was the purpose of those making the contracts and
leases to circumvent the laws and defeat the policy of
the United States established for the conservation of the
naval petroleum reserves. The purpose of the representatives of the Department was to get for the Navy fuel

Opinion of the Court.

depots or storage facilities that had not been authorized
by Congress. The leases were made to obtain the crude
products for use as a substitute for money to make good
the amounts advanced by petitioners to pay for such improvements. The Secretary's authority to provide facilities in which to "store" naval reserve petroleum or its
products did not extend beyond those that might be provided by use of the money made available by the Act of
June 4, 1920. And, in order to get control of the oil lands
covered by the leases, the companies agreed to pay for
these unauthorized works of construction and to furnish
fuel oil and other products of petroleum suitable for naval
use to fill the storage facilities so added. The contracts
and leases and all that was done under them are so interwoven that they constitute a single transaction not authorized by law and consummated by conspiracy, corruption and fraud. The United States does not stand on
the same footing as an individual in a suit to annul a
deed or lease obtained from him by fraud. Its position
is not that of a mere seller or lessor of land. The financial
element in the transaction is not the sole or principal
thing involved. This suit was brought to vindicate the
policy of the Government, to preserve the integrity of
the petroleum reserves and to devote them to the purposes
for which they were created. The petitioners stand as
wrongdoers, and no equity arises in their favor to prevent
granting the relief sought by the United States. They
may not insist on payment of the cost to them or the
value to the Government of the improvements made or
fuel oil furnished as all were done without authority and
as means to circumvent the law and wrongfully to obtain
the leases in question. As Congress had not authorized
them, it must be assumed that the United States did
not want the improvements made or was not ready to
bear the cost of making them. No storage of fuel oil at
Pearl Harbor was authorized to be made in excess of the

capacity of, or in any places other than, the facilities provided for that purpose pursuant to authorization by Congress. Whatever their usefulness or value, it is not for the
courts to decide whether any of these things are needed or
should be retained or used by the United States. Such
questions are for the determination of Congress. It would
be unjust to require the United States to account for them
until Congress acts; and petitioners must abide its
judgment in respect of the compensation, if any, to be
made. And this applies to the claim on account of the
fuel oil as well as to the other items. Clearly petitioners
are in no better position than they would be if they had
paid money to the United States, instead of putting the
fuel oil in storage. Equity does not condition the relief
here sought by the United States upon a return of the
consideration. United States v. TrinidadCoal Co., supra;
