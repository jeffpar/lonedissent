NEW YORK EX REL. COHN v. GRAVES ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 404. Argued February 3, 1937.-Decided March 1, 1937.
1. A State may tax her citizen upon the income he receives by way
of rents from lands situate in another State and by way of interest
on bonds secured by mortgage on lands situate in another State.
Pp. 312, 316.
2. The receipt of income by a resident is a taxable event. P. 312.
3. Domicil itself affords a basis for such taxation. P. 313.
4. Enjoyment of the privileges of residence in the State and the
attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws are inseparable from responsibility for sharing the costs of government. Id.
5. Neither the privilege nor the burden is affected by the character
of the source from which the income is derived. For that reason
income is not necessarily clothed with the tax immunity enjoyed
by its source. Id.
6. A tax on the income from land is not a tax on the land (Pollock
v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, distinguished), and
taxation of both, by the same or different States, is not double
taxation. P. 314.
7. In reviewing the judgment of a state court, this Court will not
pass upon any federal question not shown by the record to have
been raised in the state court or considered there, although it be
one arising under the same clause in the Constitution with respect
to which other questions are properly presented. P. 317.

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether a state may
constitutionally tax a resident upon income received from
rents of land located without the state and from interest
on bonds physically without the state and secured by
mortgages upon lands similarly situated.

N. Y. EX REL. COHN v. GRAVES.
308

Opinion of the Court.

Section 351 of Article 16 of the New York Tax-Law
(N. Y. Laws 1919, c. 627), imposes a tax upon the "entire
net income" of residents of the state. By § 359 gross
income is defined as including interest and rent. The
same section, as amended by N. Y. Laws 1935, c. 933,
enumerates among the items of taxable income "rent
(including rent derived from real property situated outside the state) . . . it being intendedi to include all the
foregoing items without regard to the source thereof, location of the property involved, or any other factor except
only a case where the inclusion thereof would be violative
of constitutional restrictions."
Appellant, a resident of New York, brought the present
certiorariproceeding in the courts of New York to review
a determination of the State Tax Commission, appellees,
denying her application for a refund of state income
taxes assessed and paid for the years 1931 and 1932, so
far as the taxes were attributable to rents received by
appellant from New Jersey land, and interest paid on
bonds secured by mortgaged real estate in New Jersey,
where the bonds and mortgages Were physically located.
A ground for recovery of the tax assigned by appellant's
petition was that the tax was in substance and effect a
tax on real estate and tangible property located without
the state, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. Judgment for
appellant (see 246 App. Div. 335; 286 N. Y. S. 485),
was reversed by the New York Court of Appeals, 271
N. Y. 353; 3 N. E. (2d) 508. The case comes here on
appeal under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code.
The stipulation of facts on which the case was tried
in the state court does not indicate that appellant's income has been taxed by New Jersey, and it does not
define the precise nature of her interest in the properties producing the income. It sets out that appellant's
husband died testate, his will duly probated in New

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

Jersey "devising and bequeathing to said taxpayer the
entire net income from his estate for and during her
widowhood," and that the taxed income included "rents
from testator's real estate" and "interest from testator's
real estate mortgages," all located in New Jersey. The
terms of the will and the status of the estate during the
tax years do not otherwise appear. There is nothing
to show that the income-producing properties were in
those years held upon an active trust, or that appellant
did not receive the income as life tenant of the legal
interest. See Paletz v. Camden Safe Deposit & Trust
Co., 109 N. J. Eq. 344; 157 Atl. 456; cf. Passman v.
Guarantee Trust & Safe Deposit Co., 57 N. J. Eq. 273;
41 Atl. 953; Westfield Trust Co. v. Beekman, 97 N. J. Eq.
140; 128 Atl. 791. Any uncertainty arising from the
ambiguity of the stipulation, if it has any present significance, is put at rest by the concession of appellant
in brief, and in open court on the argument, that she is
the owner of a life estate or interest in the properties,
and that she received, as a part of her income in the tax
years, the rents and interest which have been collected
by the executors acting, not in their capacity as executors, but as her agents for an annual compensation.
In any case we may assume, for present purposes, that
New York may not levy a property tax upon appellant's
interest, whether it be legal or equitable, see Senior v.
Braden, 295 U. S. 422; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v.
Virginia, 280 U. S. 83. We accordingly limit our review
to the question considered and decided by the state
court, whether there is anything in the Fourteenth
Amendment which precludes the State of New York from
taxing the income merely because it is derived from
sources, which, to the extent indicated, are located outside
the State.
Income from rents. That the receipt of income by a
resident of the territory of a taxing sovereignty is a

taxable event is universally recognized. Domicil itself
affords a basis for such taxation. Enjoyment of the
privileges of residence in the state and the attendaht
right to invoke the protection of its laws are inseparable
from responsibility for sharing the costs of government.
"Taxes are what we pay for civilized society ... "
See Compahia General de Tabacos v. Collector, 275
U. S. 87, 100. A tax measured by the net income of
residents is an equitable method of distributing the
burdens of government among those who are privileged
to enjoy its benefits. The tax, which is apportioned to
the ability of the taxpayer to pay it, is founded upon the
protection afforded by the state to the recipient of the
income in his person, in his right to receive the income
and in his enjoyment of it when received. These are
rights and privileges which attach to domicil within the
state. To them and to the equitable distribution of
the tax burden, the economic advantage realized by the
receipt of income and represented by the power to control it, bears a direct relationship. See Lawrence v. State
Tax Comm'n, 286 U. S. 276; Maguire v. Trefry, 253
U. S. 12, 14; Virginia v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., 293
U. S. 15, 19; compare Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, 50.
Neither the privilege nor the burden is affected by the
character of the source from which the income is derived.
For that reason income is not necessarily clothed with
the tax immunity enjoyed by its source. A state may
tax its residents upon net income from a business whose
physical assets, located wholly without the state, are
beyond its taxing power, Lawrence v. State Tax Comm'n,
supra; see Schaffer v. Carter, supra, at 50. It may tax
net income from bonds held in trust and administered
in another state, Maguire v. Trefry, supra, although the
taxpayer's equitable interest may not be subjected to the
tax, Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra. It may
tax net income from operations in interstate commerce,

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

although a tax on the commerce is forbidden, United
States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321; Shaffer v.
Carter, supra. Congress may lay a tax on net income
derived from the business of exporting merchandise in
foreign commerce, although a tax upon articles exported
is prohibited by constitutional provision (Art. I, § 9, Cl.
5). Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165; Barclay & Co.
v. Edwards, 267 U. S. 442, 447.
Neither analysis of the two types of taxes, nor consideration of the bases upon which the power to impose,
them rests, supports the contention that a tax on income
is a tax on the land which produces it. The incidence of
a tax on income differs from that of a tax on property.
Neither tax is dependent upon the possession by the taxpayer of the subject of the other. .His income may be
taxed, although he owns no property, and his property
may be taxed although it produces no income. The two
taxes are measured by different standards, the one by
the amount of income received over a period of time, the
other by the value of the property at a particular date.
Income is taxed but once; the same property may be
taxed recurrently. The tax on each is predicated upon
different governmental benefits; the protection offered
to the property in one state does not extend to the receipt and enjoyment of income from it in another.
It would be pressing the protection which the due
process clause throws around the taxpayer too far to say
that because~a state is prohibited from taxing land which
it neither protects nor controls, it is likewise prohibited
from taxing the receipt and command of income from the
land by its resident, who is subject to its control and
enjoys the benefits of its laws. The imposition of these
different taxes, by the same or different states, upon these
distinct and separable taxable interests, is not subject to
the objection of double taxation, which has been successfully urged in those cases where two or more states have

N. Y. EX REL. COHN v. GRAVES.
308

Opinion of the Court.

laid the same tax upon the same property interest in
intangibles or upon its transfer at death. Safe Deposit
& Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra; Farmers Loan & Trust
Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U. S. 204; Baldwin v. Missouri,
281 U. S. 586; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commn,
282 U. S. 1; First National Bank v. Maine, 284 U. S. 312.
These considerations lead to the conclusion that income
derived from real estate may be taxed to the recipient at
the place of his domicil, irrespective of the location of the
land, and that the state court rightly upheld the tax.
Nothing which was said or decided in Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, calls for a different
conclusion. There the question for decision was whether
a federal tax on income derived from rents of land is a
direct tax requiring apportionment under Art. I, § 2, Cl. 3
of the Constitution. In holding that the tax was "direct," the Court did not rest its decision upon the ground
that the tax was a tax on the land, or that it was subject
to every limitation which the Constitution imposes on
property taxes. It determined only that for purposes of
apportionment there were similarities in the operation of
the two kinds of tax which made it appropriate to classify
both as direct, and within the constitutional command.
See Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., supra, pp.
580, 581; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S.1,
16. And in Union Transit Refrigerator Co. v. Kentucky,
199 U. S. 194, 204, decided ten years after the Pollock
case, the present question was thought not to be foreclosed.
It is by a parity of reasoning that the immunity of
income-producing instrumentalities of one government,
state or national, from taxation by the other, has been
extended to the income. It was thought that the tax,
whether on the instrumentality or on the income produced
by it, would equally burden the operations of government. See Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124; Pollock

316

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., supra, 583; Gillespie v.
Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501. But as we have seen, it does
not follow that a tax on land and a tax on income derived
from it are identical in their incidence or rest upon the
same basis of taxing power, which are controlling factors
in determining whether either tax infringes due process.
In Senior v. Braden, supra, on which appellant relies,
no question of the taxation of income was involved. By
concession of counsel, on which the Court rested its
opinion, if the interest taxed was "land or an interest in
land situate within or without the state," the tax was
invalid, and the Court held that the interest represented
by the certificates subjected to the tax was an equitable
interest in the land. Here the subject of the tax is the
receipt of income by a resident of the taxing state, and
is within its taxing power, even though derived from
property beyond its reach.
Income from bonds secured by New Jersey mortgages.
What has been said of the power to tax income from
land without the state is decisive of the objection to the
taxation of the income from interest on bonds because
they are secured by mortgages on land without the
state, compare Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491. Appellant also argues that the interest from the bonds is
immune from taxation by New York because they have
acquired a business situs in New Jersey within the doctrine of New Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, 205 U. S. 395;
Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, 298 U. S. 193. This contention, if pertinent to the present case, is not supported
by the record. The stipulation of facts discloses only
that the bonds and mortgages were located in New Jersey. See Baldwin v. Missouri, supra; Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, 14, 15. The burden rested on the taxpayer to present further facts which would establish
a "business situs." Beidler v. Sou~h Carolina Tax
Comm'n, 282 U. S. 1, 8.

BUTLER,

J., dissenting.

Retroactive application of the tax. Appellant insists
that in upholding the tax upon her income for 1931 and
1932 the state court infringed due process by giving
retroactive effect to the 1935 amendment of § 359 of the
New York Tax Law, which specifically declared that
rents, embraced in taxable income by the section before
amendment, should include rent from real property without the state. In support of this contention appellant
points to the decision in People ex rel. Piersonv. Lynch,
266 N. Y. 431; 195 N. E. 141, affirming 237 App. Div.
763; 263 N. Y. S. 259, that rents from land outside the
state were not taxed by that section before its amendment, and to the dismissal by this Court of the writ of
certiorarito review the dudgment for want of a properly
presented federal question. 293 U. S. 52.
It is unnecessary for us to determine whether, or to
what extent, the state court, in sustaining the tax in this
case, rested its decision on the amendment of 1935, or
whether it regarded it as anything more than a clarifying
act pointing out the meaning properly attributable to the
section before amendment. The record does not disclose
that appellant raised in the state court the objection,
which she presses here, to the retroactive application of
the statute. In reviewing the judgment of a state court,
this Court will not pass upon any federal question not
shown by the record to -have been raised in the state
court or considered there, whether it be one arising under
a different or the same clause in the Constitution with
respect to which other questions are properly presented.

its value, may lay a tax upon the income received by the

Appellant's right to own, or to collect rents in New
Jersey for the use of, lands in that State was not given
and is not protected by New York law. Neither of these
rights is enjoyed in New York or has any relation to
appellant's privilege of residence in, or to the protection
of, that State. Ability of taxpayers to pay may be taken
into account for apportionment of the tax burdens that
it is authorized to impose. But the financial means
of those to be taxed cannot be made to generate for the
State power to tax lands, or rents paid for use of lands,
beyond its borders. I would exclude the item.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion.
