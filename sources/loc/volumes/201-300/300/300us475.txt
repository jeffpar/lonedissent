was a contrivance separate and distinct from the ladder,
designed and used for a purpose entirely apart from the
use of that appliance. The right of recovery, if any, must,
therefore, rest upon the effect of the near proximity of
the ladder to the rod, neither being in itself defective.
The law to be applied to that situation is the commonlaw rule ofi negligence, and not the inflexible rule of the
Safety Appliance Act; and the questions to bie answered
are whether the two appliances were maintained in such
relation to one another as to constitute negligence on
the part of the company and, if so, whether Scarlett assumed the risk. Ford v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.,
supra;Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Benson, 352 Ill. 195,
199; 185 N. E. 244; Slater v. Chicago, St. P., M. & 0. Ry.
Co., 146 Minn. 390, 392-393; 178 N. W. 813. In that
view, Scarlett in abandoning his claim under the common-law rule of negligence abandoned the only possible
ground of recovery.
Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 605.

Argued March 12, 1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

1. In a suit in the Court of Claims, a recovery by the United States
on a counterclaim, which is clearly unjust and inequitable to the
claimant, should not be allowed unless under plain compulsion
of law. P. 478.
2. Interest upon the Government's counterclaim for taxes, under the
circumstances of this case, should not have been allowed. P. 478.
In 1924, the Government was indebted to a claimant in the
sum of $119,413.04, against which there was at the same time a just
counterclaim of $82,701.29. The inequity of allowing the Govern-

ment interest for 12 years thereafter, so as to bring the claimant
in debt to the Government in the sum of over $21,000, is so gross as
to be shocking.
3. The opinion of the Court of Claims may be referred to in order
to clarify the meaning of a finding which otherwise would be in
doubt. P. 479.
4. It is unnecessary to remand a case to the Court of Claims for
the purpose of clarifying a finding as to whether there was compliance with ยง 250 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1918, making "notice
and demand by the collector" prerequisite to the allowance of
interest on unpaid taxes, where the finding, the pleadings, and
the opinion of the court, taken together, clearly show that the
section was not complied with. P. 480.
5. Nor ought the case to be remanded on the mere chance that
the Government may be able to furnish evidence which it failed to
furnish in a decade of litigation, and especially in respect of a
claim which at the bar the Government frankly conceded to be
inequitable. P. 480.

post, p. 648, to review a judgment against

the claimant in a suit against the United States upon

certain contracts, wherein the Government asserted a
counterclaim for taxes.
Messrs. J. Kemp Bartlett and Edgar Allan Poe, with
whom Messrs. Paul F. Myers and John R. Yates were on

the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Reed, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Mr. Sewall

Key were on the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.

This is a proceeding brought in the Court of Claims by
petitioner to recover a balance of $144,238.03 alleged to
be due from the government under certain designated
contracts.

The government filed a general traverse, and

a counterclaim for a deficiency income and excess-profits
tax assessment in the sum of $191,403.77. The taxes were
for the year 1918, and were assessed on the 14th day of
June, 1924. The court below found that the government
was indebted to petitioner upon the contracts in the sum
of $119,413.04. Upon the counterclaim the court found
that the tax liability of petitioner was $82,701.29. Upon
this latter sum, it allowed interest, at the rate of 6%
per annum from the date of assessment, in the sum of
$58,607.64, bringing the total allowance upon the counterclaim to the sum of $141,308.93. Judgment was given
against petitioner for the difference between that sum
and the sum due under the contracts, namely $21,895.89.
The opinion of the court will be found in 14 F. Supp.
168; and a supplemental opinion in the form of a memorandum was filed on October 5,1936. [17 F. Supp. 215.]
We granted certiorari, limited to the question of the
allowance of interest to the government upon its counterclaim.
In the argument here, both parties proceed upon the
theory that interest was allowed under the Revenue Act
of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1083, ยง 250 (e). 1 The gov'ernment contended below that under that section it was
entitled to interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month
instead of 6 per centum per annum. It abandons that
'Sec. 250. (e) If any tax remains unpaid after the date when it is
due, and for ten days after notice and demand by the collector,
then, except in the case of estates of insane, deceased, or insolvent
persons, there shall be added as part of the tax the sum of 5 per
centum on the amount due but unpaid, plus interest at the rate of 1
per centum per month upon such amount from the time it became
due: Provided, That as to any such amod'nt which is the subject of a
bona fide claim for abatement such sum of 5 per centum shall not be
added and the interest from the time the amount was due until the
claim is decided shall be at the rate of 1/2 of 1 per centum per
month. ...

contention here, but insists that it is entitled to at least
the interest allowed by the court below.
It will be seen that under the findings, the government
was indebted in 1924 to petitioner in the sum of $119,413.04, against which there was at the same time a just
counterclaim of $82,701.29; so that if the account had
been adjusted at that time instead of 12 years later, the
government would have been obliged to pay petitioner
the difference between these two sums, or $36,711.75.
The inequity of allowing the government interest for 12
years under these circumstances, so as to bring the petitioner in debt to the government in the sum of over
$21,000, is so gross as to be shocking.
We have said (United States v. The Thekla, 266 U. S.
328, 339-340, 341)-"When the United States comes into
Court to assert a claim it so far takes the position of a
private suitor as to agree by implication that justice may
be done with regard to the subject matter. The absence
of legal liability in a case where but for its sovereignty
it would be liable does not destroy the justice of the
claim against it . . . the reasons are strong for not ob-

structing the application of natural justice against the
government by technical formulas when justice can be
done without endangering any public interest." If the
principle thus stated is not strictly applicable, it at least
suggests that the court should not affirm what is clearly
an unjust and inequitable result unless under plain compulsion of law.
Section 250 (e), supra, provides for the allowance of
interest where the tax remains unpaid after the date
when it is due and "for ten days after notice and demand
by the collector." The court below found that on June
14, 1924, the commissioner made the assessment "and
duly notified plaintiff with regard thereto." It made no
other finding in respect of that matter. The government
contends that the finding which was made means that

Opinion of the Court.

the commissioner set in motion the normal administrative machinery which resulted in a notice demanding
payment, and relies upon the presumption of official
regularity as being sufficient to make this finding the
equivalent of a finding of notice and demand by the collector. Pacific States Co. v. White, 296 U. S. 176, 186.
But we are dealing here not with a presumption, but
with a specific finding; and that finding should be examined in the light of the pleadings. Luckcnbach S. S.
Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 533, 539. The amended
counterclaim of the government, filed in 1927, among
other things, alleges that "the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue made an additional assessment" of which the
plaintiff [petitioner] was duly notified. The collector
is not mentioned and no demand is alleged. Considering
the finding in connection with the allegation, the former
fairly may be construed as comprehending all that was
done in attempted compliance with the condition imposed by ยง 250 (e) as a prerequisite to the allowance of
interest. But this is not all that appears.
In the memorandum supplementing the original opinion, the court below said: "The record fails to show that
any demand was made and we can not presume that it
was. On the contrary, in view of the fact that plaintiff
at the time was claiming that the defendant was indebted
to it in a sum larger than the amount of the tax, it is
more probable that no such demand was made." While
it is true that this court is not at liberty to refer to the
opinion for the purpose of eking out, controlling or modifying the scope of the findings,' the rule is not absolute
and does not preclude reference to the opinion for all
purposes Whatsoever. It is well established that in case

of ambiguity, extrinsic aid may be sought in order to
settle the meaning of a statute or a contract. We see no
reason why the principle of that rule does not permit
reference to the opinion of the court in order to clarify
the meaning of a finding otherwise in doubt. The government suggests that in such case the proper course is to
remand the case to the Court of Claims in order that
that court may supplement and clarify the finding and,
if necessary, take additional evidence to that end. Of
course, that sometimes has been done; but where, as
here, the finding, the pleadings and the opinion of the
court, taken together, clearly show that ยง 250 (e) in the
particular under consideration was not complied with,
it is unnecessary to follow that procedure.
This proceeding was originally brought in 1922. The
deficiency assessment was made while the case was pending. The counterclaim of the government was first filed
in, 1926, and an amended counterclaim in 1927. Under
these circumstances we see no reason for remanding the
case upon the mere chance that the government may be
able to furnish evidence which it has failed to furnish
during more than a decade of litigation, and especially
in respect of a claim which at the bar the government
frankly conceded to be inequitable.
The judgment should be reversed with directions to
enter judgment for petitioner, without an allowance of
interest upon the counterclaim, in accordance with the
foregoing opinion.
Reversed.
