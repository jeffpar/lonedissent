in the matter of punishment so arbitrary as to deny due
process of law to relator. Whatever may be the restraint
against discriminatory legislation imposed by the due
process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, it is not
encountered by the legislation here. The constitutional
power of Congress to prescribe greater punishment for
an offense involving the rights and property of thb
United States than for a like offense involving the rights
or property of a private person reasonably cannot be
doubted. Compare Pace v. Alabama, 106 U. S. 583.

MIDLAND REALTY CO. v. KANSAS CITY
POWER & LIGHT CO.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI.

No. 217. Argued December 17, 1936.-Decided February 1, 1937.
1. As construed by the state supreme court, which construction binds
this Court upon appeal, rates established pursuant to the provi-.

sions of the public service commission law of Missouri (R. S., 1929,
c. 33) supersede all existing contract rates. P. 113.
2. A State has power to annul and supersede rates previously established by contract between public utilities and their customers.
P. 113.
3. The public service commission law of Missouri does not violate
the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (Art. I, § 10) or
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although, as
construed by the state supreme court, existing contract rates are
abrogated thereunder by (1) the mere filing, pursuant to the
statute, of a rate schedule by the utility; or (2) the filing of
a schedule pursuant to a rate order promulgated by the commission-it appearing that, under the statute, the party now
insisting on its contract rates had opportunity, of which it did
not avail itself, to support the contract rates and to test before
the commission and in the state supreme court the validity of the
filed schedules. Pp. 112-114.
4. It is not essential that there be specific adjudication in respect
of existing contract rates in order that these may be susparsed6d by

the State in the exercise of its power to prescribe and enforce
reasonable and non-discriminatory rates. P. 114.
5. The fact that the Missouri law, as construed by the state supreme
court, permits a utility to recover the difference between rates
fixed by contract and the higher rates established pursuant to the
statute, even though the service had been furnished and paid for
in accordance with the contract before the suit was brought, the
customer having refused to pay the lawful rate, held not to render
the statute violative of the aforementioned clauses of the Constitution. P. 114.

from a judgment in favor of the Power & Light
Company in its suit to recover the difference between rates
fixed in a contract with the Realty Company and higher
rates established under the state public service commisilon law. From a judgment of the trial court which
allowed recovery in part, both parties had appealed to the
state supreme court.
APPEAL

Mr. Elliott H. Jones, with whom Mr. William C. Scarritt was on. the brief, for appellant.
Messrs. Ludwick Graves and Irvin Fane, with whom
Mr. William Chamberlainwas on the brief, for appellee.
MR.JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The questions for decision are whether, as construed in
this case by the highest court of Missouri, the statutes of
that State regulating public utilities violate Art. I, § 10
of the Constitution of the United States, declaring that
"No State shall.., pass any... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.. .," or § 1 of the Fourteenth Amend-

ment declaring "nor shall any State deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."
Appellee was plaintiff and appellant defendant below.
*They made a contract whereby the former for specified
rates agreed to furnish the latter steam for heating its
buildings in Kansas City for a term of five years ending

Opinion of the Court.

August 31, 1913, with option to defendant to extend the
contract for an additional five years. March 17, 1913,
the state public service commission law was enacted.'
May 29, following, defendant exercised its option and so
extended the term of the contract to August 31, 1918.
June 28, 1917, plaintiff in pursuance of the statute 2
filed with the commission a scheduje of steam heating
rates to become effective August 1, 1917; they were
higher than those specified in the contract. The city
and numerous users other than defendant objected; the
commission, without attempting to apportion operating
expenses and values between plaintiff's heating and electric service, found that the rates filed were unreasonably
high and prescribed, as just and reasonable, rates lower
than those filed but higher than the contract rates and
made them effective March 1, 1918. 5 Mo. P. S. C. 664.
Plaintiff filed a new schedule in accordance with the commission's order.
June 11, 1918, it complained that these rates were confiscatory. The commission, after apportioning operating
expenses and values between the electrical and steam
services, found the rates "inadequate, unjust and unreasonably low," that during none of the time was "heating
revenue sufficient to even meet the fuel expense alone,"
and that "heretofore the steam heating business has been
carried at a loss, and this loss has been borne either by
the light and power consumers or by the company."
Thereupon, it ordered new and higher rates effective
December 1, 1919. 8 Mo. P. S. C. 223, 292, 296. The
findings and order of the commission were approved by
the supreme court in State ex rel. Case v. Public Service
Comm'n, 298 Mo. 303; 249 S. W. 955.
For steam furnished defendant after August 1, 1917,
plaintiff regularly sent bills based on the rates it had

filed with the commission. Claiming the contract rates
still to be applicable, defendant paid amounts calculated
in accordance with them. Plaintiff gave defendant credit
for the payments it made. After expiration of the period
covered by the contract as extended, plaintiff brought
this suit. For steam furnished after August 1, 1917, and
before March 1, 1918, it sought to recover on the basis of
the charges specified in the first schedule filed. For steam
furnished after March 1, 1918, to the end of the contract
term, it sought to recover on the basis of charges of the
schedule promulgated by the commission. The trial
court held plaintiff not entitled to recoVer on its claim
in respect of the first period but gave judgment in its
favor in respect of the other one. Both parties appealed.
The Missouri supreme court ruled the contract rates not
applicable, held plaintiff entitled to recover on its claim
in respect of both periods and directed that it have judgment for the sums calculated on the basis of the schedules
filed with the commission.
Defendant's contention is not that the State lacked
power by appropriate action to establish and enforce just
and reasonable rates but that, as against the constitutional provisions invoked, the action taken under the
public sef vice commission law was not sufficient to
,abrogate the contract rates.
Specifically, its complaints are that the court construed
the statute (-1) to make (a) mere filing of plaintiff's
schedule and (b) the later promulgation of a schedule by
the commission effective to abrogate the contract rates
atid (2) to require that, although the contract was in
due time fully performed and defendant prior to the
commencement of the suit had paid plaintiff the contract
rates, it was bound to pay additional amounts calculated
on the basis of the higher rates specified in plaintiff's
published schedules. It is upon these grounds that de-

fendant contends that the state law violates the quoted
clauses of the Constitution.
These questions are to be decided upon the construction that the state supreme court put upon the statute.
And that law is to be taken as if it declared that rates
made in accordance with its provisions shall supersede
all existing contract rates.' There is here involved no
question as to the validity of the rates prior to the passage of the statute. Without expression of opinion, we
assume that then the parties were bound by the contract.
But the State has power to annul and supersede rates
previously established by contract between utilities and
their customers.' It has power to require service at
nondiscriminatory rates, to prohibit service at rates too
low to yield the cost rightly attributable to it,' and to
require utilities to publish their rates and to adhere to
them.' Under the challenged statute, defendant .had
opportunity to support the contract rates and to test before the commission and in the state supreme court-'Fulton v. Public Service Comm'n, 275 Mo. 67; 204 S. W. 386;

as others did-the validity of the filed schedule.7

It

failed to do so. And it here insists that the contracts
could not be abrogated "without a proper hearing, finding and order of the commission with respect thereto."
It does not, and reasonably it could not, contend that
immediate exertion by the legislature of the State's
power to prescribe and enforce reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates depends upon or is conditioned by specific adjudication in respect of existing contract rates.8
It is clear that, as against those specified in the contract here involved, the rates first filed by plaintiff and
those promulgated by the commission in accordance with
the statute have the same force and effect as if directly
prescribed by the legislature.'
Lacking in merit is defendant's contention that the
statute violates the clauses of the Constitution invoked
because held by the court to require that, although before
this suit the service had been furnished and paid for in
accordance with the contract, defendant was bound to
pay more. As shown above, the rates specified in the
schedules were held applicable from and after their respective effective dates. Defendant was not injured by
plaintiff's failure to withhold service or more promptly
to sue for the difference between its lawful charges and
the amount paid. It cannot derive any advantage from
refusal to pay.'"
Plainly, enforcement of the rates in accordance with
the statute did not violate either the contract clause of

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 254. Argued January 4, 5, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.
1. A suit under § 9 of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended
by § 11 of the Settlement of War Claims Act, against the Attorney General (successor to the Alien Property Custodian) and
the Treasurer of the United States, to recover property seized
from a former enemy owner, is a suit against the United States.
P. 118.
2. The consent of the United States to be so sued was not withdrawn by Public Resolution No. 53, of June 27, 1934. Id.
This Public Resolution provides, inter alia, that all deliveries
of money or property authorized or directed by the statutes above
cited, shall be postponed and the money or property reserved,
as long as Germany remains in arrears in payments under the
debt funding agreement between Germany and the United States,
dated June 23, 1930, respecting Germany's obligations on account
of awards of the Mixed Claims Commission, etc.
3. In postponing restoration of property to former enemy owners,
as allowed and provided for by the Settlement of War Claims
Act, Public Resolution No. 53, supra, did not infringe their rights
under the Fifth Amendment. P. 120.
4. Seizures under the Trading With the Enemy Act divested the
enemy owners of all right to the property seized and vested absolute title in the United States. Id.
5. The fact that Congress manifested from the beginning its intention
after the War to deal justly with former owners of seized enemy
property, and by restitution or compensation to ameliorate hardship resulting from such seizures, detracted nothing from the title
acquired by the United States or its power to retain or dispose
