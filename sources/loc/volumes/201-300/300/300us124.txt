APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH

No. 235.

CAROLINA.

Argued January 4, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. A North Carolina statute providing that when the mortgagee,
payee, or other holder of an obligation secured by real estate
causes a sale of the property by a trustee, becomes the purchaser for a sum less than the amount of the debt and afterwards
brings an action for the deficiency, the defendant may show, by
way of defense and set-off, that the property sold was fairly
worth the amount of the debt or that the sum bid was substantially
less than the true value of the property, and thus defeat the claim
in whole or in part, held valid in application to notes secured by
deed of trust executed prior to the passage of the law. P. 129.
2. The obligation of a contract is not impaired by a law limiting
the remedy, if a remedy adequate for enforcing the obligation
remains or is substituted. P. 128.
210 N. C. 29; 185 S. E. 482, affirmed.
In an action to collect a balance due on a mortgage

debt, the plaintiff, appellant here, was defeated in a Gen-

eral County Court in North Carolina.

The judgment

was affirmed by the Superior Court, whose judgment was
in turn affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.

Argument for Appellanlt.

Mr. Kester Walton, with whom Mr. John Y. Jordan,Jr.,
was on the brief, for appellant.
The parties contracted with reference to the laws then
in existence and such laws enter into and form part of
the contract. This is true of the laws providing remedies
to enforce performance. Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v.
Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398; United States ex rel. Von Hoffman v. Quincy, 4 Wall. 535; Sturges v. Crowninshield,

Sterrett, 201 N. C. 59; Green v. Asheville, 199 N. C. 516;
Trust Company v. Hudson, 200 N. C. 688.
The Act in question changed the law of North Carolina,
whereby the beneficiary in a deed of trust, after foreclosure under power of sale, is required to accept the fair
value of the property as payment on the indebtedness in
lieu of recovery of money judgment. In re Crystal Ice &

This law, while acting only on the remedy, impaired

unconstitutional as applied to this case. Sturges v.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme
Court of North Carolina 1 sustaining the validity of a
statute claimed to impair the obligation of a contract,
contrary to Article I, ยง 10, of the'Federal Constitution.
The act provides that when the mortgagee, payee, or
other holder of an obligation secured by real estate or
personal property causes a sale of the property by a
'210 N. C. 29, 185 S. E. 482.

Opinion of the Court.

trustee, becomes the purchaser for a sum less than the

amount of the debt and afterwards brings an action for
the deficiency, the defendant may show, by way of defense and set-off, that the property sold was fairly worth
the amount of the debt or that the sum bid was sub-

stantially less than the true value of the property, and
thus defeat the claim in whole or in part. The provision
is copied in full in the margin.2
In 1928 the appellees borrowed $8,000 from the appellant for which they executed negotiable promissory
notes. As security they delivered a deed of trust pledging real estate. Upon default the appellant demanded
that the trustee declare the indebtedness due, in accordance with the terms of the notes and deed of trust, and
exercise the power of sale given by the deed. The trus'Section 3 of Chapter 275, of the Laws of 1933:
"When any sale of real estate or personal property has been made
by a mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to make the
same, at which the mortgagee, payee or other holder of the obligation thereby secured becomes the purchaser and takes title either
directly or indirectly, and thereafter such mortgagee, payee or other
holder of the secured obligation, as aforesaid, shall sue for and undertake to recover a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor, trustor
or other maker of any such obligation whose property has been so
purchased, it shall be competent and lawful for the defendant against
whom such deficiency judgment is sought to allege and show as
matter of defense and off-set, but not by way of counter-claim, that
the property sold was fairly worth the amount of the debt secured by
it' at the time and place of sale or that the amount bid was substantially less than its true value, and, upon such showing, to defeat
or off-set any deficiency judgment, against him, either in whole or in
part; Provided, this section shall not affect nor apply to the rights
of other purchasers or of innocent third parties, nor shall it be held
to affect or defeat the negotiability of any note, bond or other
obligation secured by such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument; Provided, further, this section shall not apply to foreclosure
sales made pursuant to an order or decree of court nor to any judgment sought or rendered in any foreclosure suit nor to any sale
heretofore made and confirmed."

tee advertised the property, as required by the deed and
the laws of the state, and made sale June 19, 1933; and
one acting in appellant's interest purchased the land for
$3,000. Upon expiration of a ten day period of redemption the property was conveyed to the purchaser. The
appellant credited on the notes the sum realized by the
sale, which left $4,534.79 with interest, due and unpaid,
and on June 18, 1934, brought action to recover this
balance. The appellees pleaded the statute and alleged
that the property, at the time and place of sale, was
fairly worth the amount of the debt. In reply the appellant asserted that, as the notes and deed of trust had
been executed prior to the passage of the law, the statute
violated the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.
At the trial exception was taken to the court's refusal
.to enter judgment for the appellant on the pleadings.
The court, over the appellant's objection and exception,
submitted to the jury the question of the fair value of
the property at the time and place of sale, and the jury
found its value to be $8,000. An intermediate appellate
court, and the Supreme Court of the State,. affirmed
judgment for the appellees.
Although admitting that the challenged legislation
affects only a remedy for enforcement of the contract,
the appellant urges that the alteration is so substantial
as to impair the obligation of the contract. The applicable principle is not in dispute. The legislature may
modify, limit or alteir the remedy for enforcement of a
contract without impairing its obligation, but in so doing, it may not deny all remedy or so circumscribe the
existing remedy with conditions and restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right.' The particular
remedy existing at the date of the contract may be altogether abrogated if another equally effective for the
Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56, and cases cited.

Opinion of the Court.

enforcement of the obligation remains or is substituted
for the one taken away.
The matter in dispute is
whether the questioned enactment falls beyond the
boundary of permissible regulation of the remedy for
enforcement of the appellant's contract.
The loan rendered the appellees debtors to the appellant. For that debt the borrower pledged real estate as
security. The contract contemplated that the lender
should make itself whole, if necessary, out of the security, but not that it should be enriched at the expense
of the borrower or realize more than would repay the
loan with interest. The state provided remedies whereby
the security could be made available for solution of the
debt.
When the loan was made two such remedies were available. The mortgagee could proceed by bill in equity to
foreclose the security. If it did the chancellor who controlled the proceeding could set aside a sale if the price
bid was inadequate. In addition, he migtht award a
money decree for the amount by which the avails of the
sale fell below the amount of the indebtedness, but his
decree in that behalf would be governed by well understood principles of equity. An alternative remedy sanctioned by state law was available if the deed of trust so
provided. This was the sale of the pledged property by
the trustee. If this were the remedy authorized by the
contract, an d the mortgagee himself became the purchaser at the trustee's sale, he might thereafter, in an
action at law, recover the difference between the price he
had bid and the amount of the indebtedness. The statute under attack effected certain alterations of this remedy. Sections 1 and 2, not here in issue, provide that if
the mortgaged property be sold under pover of sale, and

the sum bid be inadequate so that consummation of the
sale would be inequitable, the mortgagor may apply to
the superior court for an order enjoining such consummation, and the judge may direct a resale by a trustee or
by a commissioner appointed for the purpose, upon terms
he may deem just and equitable. These sections modifying the procedure under a power of sale so as to assimilate it to the procedure in strict foreclosure, have been
sustained as constitutional by the State Supreme'Court5
The section with which we are concerned adds that if the
mortgagee becomes the purchaser at the trustee's sale,
and afterwards brings an action at law for a deficiency,
the jury shall determine the actual amount needed by
him to make him whole for his debt by finding the true
or fair value of the property at the date of sale, the'judgment being for the difference between that value and the
amount of the debt remaining unpaid, or, if the value
found equals the amount of the debt, for the defendant.
The statute has no application if the purchaser at the
trustee's sale be other than the mortgagee. The act
alters and modifies one of the existing remedies for realization of the value of the security, but cannot fairly be
said to do more than restrict the mortgagee to that for
which he contracted, namely, payment in full. It recognizes the obligation of his contract and his right to its
full enforcement but limits that right so as to prevent
his obtaining more than his due. By the old and well
known remedy of foreclosure a mortgagee was so limited
because of the chancellor's control of the proceeding.
That proceeding, as has been said, has always been available to the mortgagee in North Carolina. Granting that
by the alternative remedy of trustee's sale the mortgagee

Syllabus.

might perchance obtain something more, or might obtain
only that which was his due somewhat more expeditiously, than he could in chancery, it remains that the
procedure to foreclose in equity is, and has been, the
classical method of realization upon mortgage security
and has always been understood to be fair to both parties
to the contract and to afford an adequate remedy to the
mortgagee. If, therefore, the legislature of ,the State
had elected altogether to abolish the remedy by trustee's
sale we could not say that it had not left the mortgagee
an adequate remedy for the enforcement of his contract.
But the legislature hag by no means gone so far. The
law has merely restricted the exercise of the contractual
remedy to provide a procedure which, to some extent,
renders the remedy by a trustee's sale consistent with
that in equity. This does not impair the obligation of
the contract.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
