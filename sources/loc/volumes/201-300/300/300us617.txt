DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. CLAWANS.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 103.

Argued November 18, 1936. Reargued March 1, 1937.Decided April 5, 1937.

1. The offense of engaging, without a license, in the business of a
dealer in second-band personal property, defined by the Code of
the District of .Columbia, puiishable by a fine of not more than
$300 or imprisonment of not more than 90 days, is to be classed
as a petty offense which, consistently with Art. III, § 2, cl. 3, of
the Constitution, may be tried without a jury. P. 624.
2.. In determining whether an offense Is a petty offense that constitutionally may be tried without a jury, the severity of the
- penalty inflictable, as well as the moral quality of the act and its
relation to common law crimes, should be considered. P. 625.

3. Engaging in the business of selling second-hand property without
a license was not indictable at common law. Today it is at most
but an infringement of local police regulations, and its moral quality
is relatively inoffensive. P. 625.
4. In England and in the American States, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, confinement for a period of 90 days or
more was not an unusual punishment for petty offenses, tried
without a jury. P. 626.
5. The question whether an offense is triable without a jury is unaffected by the fact that the offender is not entitled to an appeal
as of right; it must be assumed that, in.a proper case, authority
in the appellate court to allow an appeal Will be exercised.- P. 627.
6. Assuming that, with -change of the common attitude towards
severity of punishment, a petty .offense whic h,.at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution, would have been triable without a
jury may come within the provision 'of the Constitution requiring
jury trial, the existence of such change must be determined by
objective standards such as may be seen in the laws and_ practices
of the community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments. P. 627.
The Act of Congress applicable to this case, and- statutes in
force in the States and in England, together with numerous state
court decisions, are examined and are persuasive that there has
been no such change in the generally accepted standards of punishment as would overcome the presumption that a summary punishment of 90 days' imprisonment, permissible when the Constitution was adopted, is permissible now.
7. Common experience teaches that testimony delivered against a
defendant in a criminal case by private police or detectives, acting
in the course of their private employment, is open to the suspicion of bias, especially when uncorroborated; and the crossexamination of such witnesses, bearing directly on substantial
issues, should not be summarily curtailed. P. 630.
8. While the extent of cross-examination rests in the sound discretion
of the trial judge, in this case discretion was abused, and the error
prejudicial. P. 632.
Throughout the trial, rulings of the judge prevented cross-examination in appropriate fields and excluded questions bearing on the
credibility of witnesses for the prosecution and on the commission
by the accused of the acts charged.

299 U. S. 524, to review a judgment re-

versing a conviction in the Police Court of the District of
Columbia. The opinion disapproves of the reason given
by the court below but affirms the reversal upon another
ground which that court deemed unsubstantial.
Mr. Raymond Sparks, with whom Messrs. Elwood Seai
and Vernon E. West were on the brief, for petitioner.
The Constitution does not require the trial of petty
offenses by jury. The character of such offenses is determined by reference to the procedure at common law.
Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65; Colts v. District
of Columbia, 282 U. S. 63, 73; Callanv. Wilson, 127 U. S.

276, 312; Ex parte Grossman, 267 U. S. 87, 108.
At common law, prior to the adoption of the Constitution, there were many offenses, both in England and
America, in the trial of which no jury was allowed. These
included not only offenses punishable by fines, but others
in which corporal punishment or imprisonment might be
imposed. [Giving numerous instances.] People ex rel.

Argument for Respondent.

300 U. S.

State v. Rodgers, 91 N. J. L. 212; Katz v. Eldridge, 97
N. J. L. 123.

The license -law is in the nature of a muni-ipal ordinance and Congress has properly treated a violation of
the law as a petty offense. District of Columbia v. Colts,
282 U. S. 63, 72; State v. Rodgers, 91 N. J. L. 212, 214.
The absence of an absolute right of appeal does not
affect the right of trial by jury.
The opinion of the lower court is inconsistent with the
decisions of this Court. Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S.
475, 487; Continental Bank v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry.,
294 U. S. 648, 669.
Mr. Seth W. Richardson,with whom Mr. Allen Caruthers and Miss Lillian -Clawans were on the brief, for
respondent.
This Court may consider all contentions of respondent duly presented below, even though the petition for
certiorari is based on a single proposition, as such additional contentions are for the purpose of sustaining the
judgment of the Court of Appeals. Jud. Code, §§ 240,
269.
Defendant was entitled to a jury trial.
The numerous statutes cited by petitioner show that
a special Act was necessary to authorize administration
of summary punishment even at common law.. License
violations do not appear to have been dealt with by the
common law.
Ever since the decision of this Court in Schick v:
United States, 195 U. S. 65, it has been plain that either
the nature of an offense or the prescribed punishment
might determine the right to a trial by a jury. It is thus
reasonable to conclude that, even with respect to an
offense denominated as petty under the common law, and
which was subject to summary punishment at common
law, if, in more modern times, the punishment shall have
been increased from a petty degree to a substantial de-

DIST. OF COLUMBIA v. CLAWANS.

Argument for Respondent.

gree, the rule of summary punishment at common law
would no longer apply. The offense would, because of
the severity of the punishment, be entitled to a classification as a-criminal offense, and therefore come within
the constitutional provision granting the right to a jury
trial.
In 1871, a licensing Act was passed by the District Assembly, which fixed the penalty for violation at a fine of
not less than $5.00 or more than $50.00, without imprisonment. A jury trial was permitted. Lasley v. District,
14 App. D. C. 407. In 1902, the offense was made punishable by not to exceed $500.00 fine and thirty days in jail,
in default of payment. At this period, the defendant
was entitled to appeal, and secure a jury trial in the
Supreme Court of the District. Dist. of Col. Rev. Stats.,
§§ 1073-7, 773. It was not until 1925, that right of appeal was withdrawn, and right of trial by jury was likewise limited to cases involving punishment in excess of
90 day4' imprisonment and $300.00 fine.
We think it fair to say that the various state decisions
seem quite irreconcilable, and not unnaturally so, since
jury provisions in the various state constitutions differ
widely. But these cases do, generally, establish the following conclusions: (a) That summary punishment at
common law usually depended on a specific statute; (b)
That the punishments usually viewed as "trivial" are not
comparable in severity with the punishment here involved; (c) That severity of sentence is a controlling
feature in determining right to a jury trial; (d) That in
license cases in the state courts, jury trials are commonly
afforded.
In Callan v. Wilson, 127 U, S. 540, the court did not
concede that there was a class of "petty" or minor offenses
not usually embraced in criminal statutes, which, if committed in this District, may under the authority of Congress be tried by the court and without a jury. It merely

assumed this for the purposes of decision. The orily issue
involved was the right of a defendant to waive a jury in
a criminal prosecution.
No policy of convenience should be permitted to
destroy the safeguards of liberty under the Constitution.
Such a policy has frequently been commented upon and
discouraged by this Court. See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293
U. S. 486; 4 Blatkstone, c. 27, p. 350.
The record is not sufficient to sustain a judgment that
the defendant was "engaged in the business of dealer in
second-hand personal property."
Defendant's rights on cross-examination of the prosecuting witnesses were prejudicially curtailed.
The defendant was not given a fair trial.
The fact that a right of an appeal is not an absolute one
is a potent reason why one charged with a criminal offense under a law which does not allow this right, should
have a jury pass upon the fact of guilt or innocence as
provided by the Constitution. See Dimick v. Schiedt,
293 U. S., p. 486, and authorities cited.
The opinion of the lower court is in accord with the
decisions of this Court and the best considered cases in
the highest courts of the States, as well as numerous
decisions in the Circuit Courts of Appeals. Frank v.
Unitqd States, 192 Fed. 864; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S.
540; .Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65.
There is not a decision of this Court or of any federal
court defining clearly what is or what is not a "petty
offense,"
The petitioner cites several cases, to-wit, Patton v.
United States, 281 U. S. 276; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S.
540; Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 486; and West v.
Gammon, 98 Fed. 426, to the effect that the guarantee of
a trial by jury has always been construed to mean a trial
in the mode and according to the settled rules of the
common law, including all the essential elements recog-

nized in this country and England, when the Constitution
was adopted. This means nothing more than that the
word jury, when used in the Constitution, means a jury
of 12 men and that any less number is not within the
meaning of the Constitution. The logical result of petitioner's argument is that Congress could pro'Vide a trial
without a jury in any case where, before the adoption
of the Constitution, such a case had been tried either
under an Act of Parliament or in the Colonies summarily
without a jury, regardless of the nature of the offense or
the punishment.
MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Respondent was convicted in the District of Columbia
police court of engaging, without a license, in the business
of a dealer in second-hand personal property, to-wit, the
unused portions of railway excursion tickets, in violation
of § 7, par. 39, of the Act of Congress, approved July 1,
1902, 32 Stat. 622, c. 1352, as amended by the Act of
July 1, 1932, 47 Stat. 550, C. 356. On arraignment she
demanded a jury trial, which was denied, and on conviction she was sentenced to pay a fine of $300 or to be confined in jail for sixty days. The case was brought to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by writ
of error to review .the denial of the respondent's request
for a jury, and other rulings of the trial court which, it was
claimed, had deprived her of a fair trial. The Court of
Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that a jury trial
was guaranteed to petitioner by the Constitution, but
that the trial had been fair in other respects. 66 App.
D. C. 11; 84 F. (2d) 265. We granted certiorari.
The statute under which petitioner was convicted
provides that the offense may be prosecuted in the District of Columbia police court and is punishable by a fine
of not more than $300 or imprisonment for not more than
ninety days. The Code of the District of Columbia

624

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

(1929) Tit. 18, § 165, provides that prosecutions in the
police court shall be on information and that the trial
shall be by jury in all cases "in which, according to the
Constitution of the United States, the accused would be
entitled to a jury trial," and that, "In all cases where the
accused would not by force of the Constitution of the
United States be entitled to a trial by jury, the trial shall
be by the court without a jury, unless in . . . cases
wherein the fine or penalty may be more than $300, or
imprisonment as punishment for the offense may be more
than ninety days, the accused shall demand a trial by jury,
in which case the trial shall be by jury." Article III, § 2,
Clause 3, of the Constitution, provides that "The Trial of
all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by
Jury. . . ." The Sixth Amendment declares that "In
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed,

"

It is settled by the decisions of this Court, which need
not now be discussed in detail, that the right of trial by
jury, thus secured, does not extend to every criminal proceeding. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution
there were numerous offenses, commonly described as
"petty," which were tried summarily without a jury, by
justices of the peace in England, and by police magistrates
or corresponding judicial officers in the Colonies, and punished by commitment to jail, a workhouse, or a house of
correction.' We think, as the Court ,of Appeals held and

Opinion of the Court.

respondent concedes, that, apart from the prescribed penalty, the offense of which petitioner was convicted is, by
its nature, of this class, and that were it not for the severity of the punishment, the offender could not, under our
decisions, claim a trial by jury as of right. Schick v.
United States, 195 U. S. 65; and see Callanv. Wilson, 127
U. S. 540, 552, 555; Natal v. Louisiana,139 U. S. 621, 624;
District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U. S. 63, 72, .73.
Engaging in the business of selling second-hand property without a license was not indictable at common law.
Today it is at most but an infringement of local police
regulations, and its moral quality is relatively inoffensive.
But this Court has refused to foreclose consideration of the
severity of the penalty as an element to be considered in
determining whether a statutory offense, in other respects
trivial and not a crime at common law, must be deemed
so serious as to be comparable with common law crimes,
and thus to entitle the accused to the benefit of a jury
trial prescribed by the Constitution. See Schick v. United
States, supra, 67-68.
We are thus brought to the question whether the penalty, which may be imposed for the present offense, of
ninety days in a common jail, is sufficient to bring it
within the class of major offenses, for the trial of which
a jury may be demanded. The court below thought, as
we do; that the question is not free from doubt, but concluded, in view of the fact that the statute allows no appeal as of right from the conviction for the offense, and
in view of its own estimate of the severity of the penalty,
that three months' imprisonment is a punishment sufficiently rigorous to place respondent's delinquency in the
category of major offenses.
. If we look to the standard which prevailed at the time
of the adoption of the Constitution, we find that confinement for a period of ninety days or more was not an un130607 -37----40

usual punishment for petty offenses, tried without a jury.
Laying aside those for which the punishment was of a
type no longer commonly employed, such as whipping,
confinement in stocks and the like, and others, punished
by commitment for an indefinite period, we know that
there were petty offenses, triable summarily under English statutes, which carried possible sentences of imprisonment for periods from three to twelve months.' At least
sixteen statutes, passed prior to the time of the American
Revolution by the Colonies, or shortly after by the newlycreated States, authorized the summary punishment of
petty offenses by imprisonment for three months or more.3
And at least eight others were punishable by imprisonment for six months.4
In the face of this history, we find it impossible to say
that a ninety day penalty for a petty offense, meted out

Opinion of the Court.

upon a trial without a jury, does not conform to standards
which prevailed when the Constitution was adopted, or
was not then contemplated as appropriate notwithstanding the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. This
conclusion is unaffected by the fact that respondent is not
entitled to an appeal as of right. Code of the District
of Columbia (1929) Tit. 18, § 28. The safeguards of an
appeal are different in nature and purpose from those of a
jury trial. At common law there was no review of
criminal cases as of right. Due process does not comprehend the right of appeal, McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S.
684, 687. The early statutes providing for summary trial
often did not allow it. And in any case it cannot be assumed that the authority to allow an appeal, given to the
justices of the Court of Appeals by the District laws, will
not be exercised in a proper case.
We are aware that those standards of action and of
policy which find expression in the common and statute
law may vary from generation to generation. Such
change has led to the abandonment of the lash and the
stocks, and we may assume, for present purposes, that
commonly accepted views of the severity of punishment
by imprisonment may become so modified that a penalty
once thought to be mild may come to be regarded as so
harsh as to call for the jury trial, which the Constitution
prescribes, in some cases which were triable without a jury
when the Constitution was adopted. See Schick v.
United States, supra, 67, 68; compare Weems v. United
States, 217 U. S. 349, 373; District of Columbia v. Colts,
supra, 74; Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 71-73; United
States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 141 et seq. But we may
doubt whether summary trial with punishment of more
than six months' imprisonment, prescribed by some preRevolutionary statutes,5 is admissible without concluding

that a penalty of ninety days is too much. Doubts must
be resolved, not subjectively by recourse of the judge to
his own sympathy and emotions, but by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of
the community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical
udgments.
Congress itself, by measuring the punishment in this
case in conformity to the commonly accepted standard
when the Constitution was adopted, and declaring that it
should be applied today unless found to transgress constitutional limitations, has expressed its deliberate judgment
that the punishment is not too great to be summarily
administered. A number of states have continued in force
statutes providing for trial, without a jury, of violations
of municipal ordinances, and sundry petty statutory offenses, punishable by commitment for three months or
more." Convictions under such legislation have been up' (A) Statutes embracing violations of municipal ordinances generally. E. g.: Ariz. Rev. Code (Struckmeyer, 1928) §§ 382, 442,
(three months); Neb. Comp. Stat. (1929) §§ 18-201, 18-205 (three
months); New Mex. Stat. (Courtright, 1929) §§ 90-402 (66),
90-901, 90-910, 79-322, (three months); Nev. Comp. Laws (Hillyer,
1929) §§ 1128 (1), 1167, (six months); Wyo. Rev. Stat. (Courtright,
1931) §§ 22-402, 22-409, (three months).
(B) Statutes commanding summary trial for specified offenses.
E. g.: N. J. Comp. Laws (1924 Supp.), §§ 135-63 (3), 135-76 (operating motor vehiele under influence of liquor; six months; see Klinges
v. Court of Common Pleas, 130 Atl. 601); N. J. Comp. Laws (1930
Supp.) § 160-222, 3 (disorderly persons act; three months penalty,
see N. J. Laws 1898, p. 954, increased to one year by laws 1910,
p. 37); Pa. Stat. Ann. (Purdon, 1931), § 18-2033 (vagrancy; six
months); § 18-2832 (frequenting of public places by thieves, for
unlawful purpose; three months).
The most extensive elimination of the jury prevails in New York.
The three-judge Court of Special Sessions, sitting without a jury, has
jurisdiction to try all misdemeanors [i. e., offenses punishable with
one year's imprisonment, N. Y. Penal Law (1909), § 1937] com-

held many times in the state courts, despite objections to
the denial of a jury trial.' In England many acts of Parliament now in force, authorizing ninety day punishments, call for summary trials.8
This record of statute and judicial decision is persuasive
that there has been no such change in the generally accepted standards of punishment as would overcome the
presumption that a summary punishment of ninety days'
imprisonment, permissible when the Constitution was
adopted, is permissible now. Respondent points to no
mitted in New York City. Inferior Criminal Courts Act of the City
of New York, N. Y. Laws 1910, c. 659, § 31 (1), (4). A city magistrate sitting alone may try certain misdemeanors, including violations

by Laws 1915, c. 531. Other legislation, state-wide in application,
provides for summary trial and conviction of persons guilty of disorderly conduct (six months), N. Y. Penal -Law (1923), §§ 723, 724;

contrary evidence. We cannot say that this penalty,
when attached to the offense of selling second-hand goods
without a license, gives it the character of a common law
crime or of a major offense, or that it so offends the public
sense of propriety and fairness as to bring it within the
sweep of a constitutional protection which it did not previously enjoy.
*Although we conclude that respondent's demand for a
jury trial was rightly denied, there must be a new trial
because of the prejudicial restriction, by the trial judge,
of cross-examination by respondent. The testimony of
five prosecution witnesses was the sole evidence of the
acts of respondent relied on to establish the doing of business without a license. These acts were the sale by her,
on each of three occasions, to one or another of the witnesses, of the unused portion of a round trip railway passenger ticket from New York to Washington. Three of
the five, a man and his wife and another, were employed
by the Railroad Inspection Company as investigators.
The other two were company police of the Baltimore &
Ohio Railroad. All were private police or detectives, apparently acting in the course of their private employment.
Common experience teaches us that the testimony of such
witnesses, especially when uncorroborated, is open to the
Under the Summary Jurisdiction, pp. 1904-1945. E. g. Frauds by
Workmen Act, 1777, 17 Geo. III, c. 56, § 1; Merchandise Marks Act,
1887, 50 & 51 Vict., c. 28, § 2; Agricultural Marketing Act, 1933, 23
& 24 Geo. V, c. 31, § 6 (5).
Several of the statutes specify larger penalties, but by § 17 of the
Sufamary Judicature Act, 1879, 42-43 Vict., c. 49, except in cases of
assaillt, sentences exceeding three months cannot be administered
unless the accused has been offered the choice of trial by jury.

2062, and that their cross-examination should not be curtailed summarily, see State v. Diedtnan, 58 Mont. 13,
24; 190 Pac. 117, especially when it has a direct bearing
on the substantial issues of the case.
The defense was a suggested mistaken identity of respondent and an alibi, that at the times mentioned she
was confined to her bed by illness, at her home in Newark,
New Jersey. A number of questions on cross-examina'tion by respondent were aimed at showing mistaken identity and at testing credibility. She asked one witness
whether respondent had been pointed out to him. She
asked another whether he had any trouble in "knowing"
the respondent at the trial, and whether he had seen
her before the date of the alleged sale of tickets to which
he testified. All these questions were excluded, as were
others which were proper, since they might have established contradiction in the testimony of the witnesses for
the prosecution.
Other questions, which were relevant to the issue and
obviously proper tests of credibility, were excluded. The
woman- witness had testified that one of the sales took
place in the presence of her husband, and of the two
railroad police witnesses. On cross-examination she
could not remember whether anyone beside her husband
was present. Yet respondent was not permitted to ask
the husband whether the railroad police witnesses were

known to him or to ask one of the latter whether he knew
the husband and wife before the date of the alleged sale.
The court instructed one of the police officers not to
answer the question whether the husband had come to
Washington by prearrangement. Like questions addressed to the husband and his wife were excluded. The
respondent was similarly prevented from making inquiries as to corroborative detail, such as the time of
day when the witnesses arrived in Washington on the
dates of the alleged sales, and the place of residence of
a witness, see Alford v. United States, 282 U. S. 687.
In the circumstances of the case, these questions may
have had an important bearing on the accuracy and
truthfulness of the testimony of the prosecuting witnesses. We do not stop to give other examples of the
summary curtailment of all inquiry as to matters which
are the appropriate subject of cross-examination.
The extent of cross-examination rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. Reasonable restriction of undue cross-examination, and the more rigorous exclusion
of questions irrelevant to the substantial issues of the
case, and of slight bearing on the bias and credibility
of the witnesses, are not reversible errors. But the prevention, throughout the trial of a criminal case, of all
inquiry in fields where cross-examination is appropriate,
and particularly in circumstances where the excluded
questions have a bearing on credibility and on the commission by the accused of the acts relied upon for conviction, passes the proper limits of discretion and is
prejudicial error. See Alford v. United States, supra.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals will be affirmed,
that of the police court reversed, and the case will be

and I approve the conclusion of

the Court of Appeals concerning respondent's right to
trial by jury; also we accept the supporting opinion
announced there as entirely adequate.
The Sixth Amendment-In all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy, and public
trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall-have been previously ascertained by law, and
to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation;
to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have
compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.
The Seventh Amendment-In suits at common law,
where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty. dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no
fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any
court of the United States than according to the rules
of the common law.
We cannot agree that when a citizen is put on trial for
an offense punishable by 90 days in jail or a fine of
$300.00, the prosecution is not criminal within the Sixth
Amendment. In a suit at common law to recover above
$20.00, a jury trial is assured. And to us, it seems improbable that while providing for this, protection in such a
trifling matter the framers of the Constitution intended

that it might be denied where imprisonment for a considerable time or liability for fifteen times $20.00 confronts
the accused.
In view of the opinion just announced, it seems permissible to inquire what will become of the other solemn
declarations of the Amendment. Constitutional guaran-.
tees ought not to be subordinated to convenience, nor
denied upon questionable precedents or uncertain reasoning. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 635; In
re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594.
We concur in the conclusion of the Court concerning
unfairness of the trial and the necessity for a new one.
This cause shows the grave danger to liberty when
the accused must submit to the uncertain judgment of a
single magistrate.
