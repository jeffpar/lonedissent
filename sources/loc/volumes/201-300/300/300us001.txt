CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 280.

Argued January 6, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

A non-discriminatory state tax, ad valorem, on equipment used by a
private corporation in operating for oil and gas under a lease to
it of restricted Indian 'allotments, held valid, against the claim
that it was an unconstitutional burden on a federal instrumentality.

177 Okla. 67; 57 P. (2d) 1167, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 299 U. S. 528, to review the affirmance of
a judgment against Taber, County Treasurer, in an action
by the Oil Company to recover money paid under protest
as taxes.

and L. 0. Lytle were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Donald Prentice, with whom Mr. William P. McGinnis was on the brief, for respondent.
The application of the doctrine of implied immunity
of a federal instrumentality from state taxation should
have regard to the circumstances disclosed. While in one
aspect the extent of the exemption depends upon the

effect of the tax, still the nature of the instrumentality
and the part it plays may not be disregarded, for it
may be of such a character that any taxation of it would
impose a direct burden upon the functions of government. Metcalf v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514; Union Pacific
R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5; Safe Deposit & Trpst Co.
v. Virginia, 280 U. S. 83; Wright v. Nagle, 101 U. S. 791.
An agency created and controlled by the Federal Government to enable it to develop restricted Indian land
for oil and gas is of such a character, and so intimately
connected with the performance of the functions of government, that it is immune from state taxation and the
immunity extends to the property used in its operations.

Large Oil Co. v. Howard,248 U. S. 549; Howard v. Gypsy
Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503.
The ad valorem tax sought to be levied by the State
of Oklahoma upon the equipment used by respondent in
its operations would impose a direct burden upon the
functions of government. Metcalf v. Mitchell, 269 U. S.
514; Burnet v. Jergens Trust, 288 U. S. 508; Large Oil Co.
v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549; Howard v. Gypsy Oil Co., 247
U. S. 503.
The immunity of a federal instrumentality from state
taxation is not dependent on the amount of the tax,
or the extent of the resulting interference, but is absolute.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

HUGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The respondent, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil
Company, holds an oil and gas lease covering lands of
restricted Pawnee Indians. The question relates to the
constitutional authority of the State of Oklahoma to tax
certain property used by the respondent in its operations
as lessee. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that
the property was not taxable because the lessee was a
federl instrumentality and Congress had not consented
to its taxation. 177 Okla. 67; 57 P. (2d) 1167. We
granted certiorari. October 12, 1936.
The property is described as "one dwelling, portable,
one garage, one tool house, engines, pump, water well
equipment, tanks, derricks, casing, tubing, rods, pipelines, and one trailer truck, of the aggregate value of
$15,869.23." The tax is an ad valorem tax for the year
1933-34. There is no allegation or finding that the tax
was discriminatory, the sole contention being that the
property was not subject to ad valorem taxation because
of its use as an adjunct to the production of oil and gas
from the leasehold.
Our decisions distinguish between a non-discriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government
and one which imposes a direct burden upon the exertion
of governmental powers. In the former case where there
is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of
governmental functions, we have held that a non-dis-

criminatory ad valorem tax is valid, although the property is used in the operations of the governmental agency.
This distinction, recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, was stated
and applied after full consideration in Thomson v. Pacific
Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 591, and Railroad Company v.
Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 31-36. Recent illustrations are
found in Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509, 514, where
the tax which was sustained was laid upon property used
in operating an automotive stage line between points in
California under a mail carrier's contract; and in Tirrell
v. Johnston, 293 U. S. 533, where a tax known as the
"gasoline road toll" was held to be payable by a rural
mail carrier who delivered the mail by means of his own
motor vehicle. See, also, Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264,
273; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, 195 U. S.
375, 382; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Mackey, 256 U. S.
531, 536, 537; Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 226;
Susquehanna Power Co. v. Tax Commission (No. 1), 283
U. S. 291, 294; Eastern Air Transport v. Tax Commission, 285 U. S. 147, 153.
In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of
Equalization, 288 'U. S. 325, an ad valorem tax upon
crude oil, held by the company in its storage tanks, was
sustained against the claim that the oil was exempt because in its production the taxpayer was operating as
an instrumentality of the United States. There the taxpayer relied, as does the state court here, upon the ruling
in Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U. S.609, where an
ad valoretm tax upon ores mined under a lease of restricted Indian land and in the bins on that land was
held to be invalid. But we pointed out that in the
Jaybird case the tax "was assessed on the ores in mass;
and the rdyalties and equitable interests of the Indians
had not been paid or segregated." Indian Territory

Syllabus.

Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, supra, p.
327. In those circumstances the tax was regarded as an
attempt to tax an agency of the federal government.
Emphasizing that distinction, we said in reference to the
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company: "Such immunity as petitioner enjoyed as a governmental instrumentality inhered in its operations as such, and being for
the protection of the Government in its function extended no farther than was necessary for that purpose."
Id., p. 328.
In that view, the immunity cannot be said to extend
to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax upon the property
of the petitioner which is involved in the instant case.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

No. 247.

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

Argued January 5, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. A judgment of the Circuit Court of Appealg holding a beneficiary named in a trust taxable upon trust income notwithstanding assignments previously made by him, and basing this
conclusion upon the ground that, under the local law, the trust
was a spendthrift trust giving the beneficiary no power to
assign,-held inapplicable as res judicata in favor of the Government in proceedings to collect taxes from the same person,
for. subsequent years, the situation having been changed meanwhile by a decision of the state court construing the trust and
upholding the assignments. Tait v. Western Maryland Ry. Co.,
289 U. S. 620, distinguished. P. 8.
2. Whether a testamentary trust is a spendthrift trust barring the
voluntary alienation of his interest by the beneficiary depends
