v. CHAIN, EXECUTRIX.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 335.

Argued January 8, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. A bond, with sureties, given by a national bank pursuant to the
bankruptcy law and orders, to induce the appointment of the
bank as a designated depository of bankruptcy funds, is not a
mere offer, like a continuing guaranty of future performances
revocable until something is done under it, but is a contract given
upon present, adequate and indivisible consideration-i. e., the
designation of the bank as depository-which becomes binding
when delivered to and approved by the bankruptcy court. P. 32.
2. The obligation of a surety on such a bond, in the absence of any
stipulation to the contrary, survives his death and binds his personal representative for defaults committed by the depository
after the death in respect of deposits made after the death. P. 34.
84 F. (2d) 138, reversed; District Court affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 299 U. S. 531, to review the reversal of a

the bank as a depository of funds of bankrupt estates.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This was an action on the bond of a designated depository for money of bankrupt estates. The case will be
stated.
July 22, 1924, a national bank at Kingwood, West Virginia, was designated by the bankruptcy court of that
district as a depository for funds of bankrupt estates, subject to the requirement that the bank give a bond in the

penal sum of $5,000 and that the bond have the court's
approval. Later in the same month the bond was given
by the bank and approved by the court. Thereupon the
bank became an authorized depository, and it continued
to be such, without giving any further bond, until June
22, 1931, when it failed.
The bond was under seal; named the United States as
obligee; was signed by the bank and two individual sureties, as obligors; declar3d that the obligors were thereby
binding themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators,
and successors, jointly and severally; recited the designation of the bank as a depository; and was conditioned
for the faithful discharge and performance by the bank
of all duties pertaining to it as a depository.
Between August 12, 1930, and June 22, 1931, Charles P.
Wilhelm, as trustee for the estate of W. H. Pentony; a
bankrupt, deposited in the bank, as a designated depository, various sums of money belonging to that estate, and
made authorized withdrawals, with the result that, of the
deposits so made, there remained in the bank on June 22,
1931, a balance of $3,190.72 to the credit of the trustee.
On ihat day the bank became insolvent, closed its doors,
refused to pay to the trustee the balance so owing to the
bankrupt estate, and thereby broke the condition of its
bond.
In March, 1926, which was after the bond was given
and approved and before Wilhelm, trustee, made any
deposit in the bank, James W. Flynn, one of the sureties
on the bond, died and Nellie Flynn Chain became executrix of his estate. Flynn did not at any time during
his life seek to revoke or terminate his suretyship; nor
did his executrix subsequently take any step to that
end.
The action on the bond was in the name of the United
States for the use of Wilhelm, trustee, and was brought

against the bank, the surviving surety and the executrix
of the deceased surety.
The district court gave judgment against the defendants for the balance due Wilhelm, trustee. The executrix
of the deceased surety appealed, and the court of appeals
reversed the judgment as to the estate of that surety.
84 F. (2d) 138. Certiorari was granted by this Court.
Pertinent statutes and a related general bankruptcy
order are copied in the margin.1
The crucial question for decision, as was said by the
court of appeals, is whether the obligation of an individual surety on such a depository bond terminates with
his death. That court answered in the affirmative, one
judge dissenting. It likened such a bond to a continuing guaranty whereby the guarantor, without present

consideration, guarantees a series of future performances,
such as payment of the purchase price of goods to be sold,
or repayment of ilioney to be advanced, from time to
time in the future; and it applied the usual rule that such
a guaranty is merely an offer and does not ripen into a
contract in respect of any sale or advance until the same
is made, and that the guaranty, in so far as it remains
merely an offer, may be revoked by the guarantor and is
terminated by his death.
The court rightly recognized that a continuing guaranty, if supported at the outset by a sufficient consideration, is a binding contract which is neither revocable by
the guarantor nor terminable by his death, although the
acts guaranteed may cover a long or indefinite period of
time. But it pronounced this rule inapplicable because
it regarded the bond as more nearly analogous to a continuing guaranty without present consideration.
We are of opinion that the bond was not a mere
offer but was given upon a present and sufficient consideration, and therefore became a binding contract when
it was delivered to and approved by the bankruptcy
court. The inducement, as also the occasion, for the
bond was the designation of the bank as a depository.
This was a present, adequate and indivisible consideration. 4 Without the bond the bank would not have been

entitled to the advantages of the designation; while with
the bond it was entitled to them. In this regard the
bond was like that of a collector of customs, county
treasurer, sheriff, clerk of court, administrator, guardian
or cashier, as to which it is well settled that the selection
of the officer or employe whose fidelity is assured constitutes a present consideration amply supporting the undertaking of the obligors-sureties as well as principals.'
"It is a presumption of law that the parties to a
contract bind not only themselves but their personal
representatives. Executors, therefore, are held to be
liable on all contracts of the testator which are broken
in his lifetime, and, with the exception of contracts in
which personal skill or taste is required, on all contracts
broken after his death." 6
The bond in suit is a contract for the conditional payment of money, not the exercise of personal skill or
taste, and therefore is one to which the presumption
applies. No doubt it is admissible to restrict the presumption by a stipullation limiting a surety's obligation
to defaults occurring within his lifetime, but the present
bond does not contain such a stipulation, or anything indicating that such a limitation was intended. On the
contrary, its terms are in full accord with the presumption, for in it the obligors expressly declare their purpose to bind not only themselves, but also their executors, administrators and successors, jointly and severally,
for the performance of the obligation set forth.
In a long line of decisions relating to bonds not distinguishable from the one in suit it has been held that

a surety's obligation does not terminate with his death
but binds his personal representatives for past and subseThe
quent defaults, as it would bind him if living'
principle underlying these decisions is the same that prevails in respect of other related contracts, and we regard
it as well sustained in reason and supported by the preponderant weight of authority.
Cases are brought to our attention in which it is held
that a surety may terminate his obligation as respects
future defaults by giving notice to that effect to the
obligee. But these cases are not apposite. In some
the instrument sued upon was held to be only a continuing offer without a supporting consideration and therefore revocable as to future transactions. Others rest
upon a power so to terminate expressly reserved in the
bond or in the applicable statute. Here the bond is a
binding contract supported by an adequate consideration, and there is no reservation of a right to terminate
in the bond or in the statute under which it was given.
Nor has there been any effort to effect such a termination.
Whether the bankruptcy court may, upon appropriate
application and showing, discharge a surety on an existing bond, as respects possible future defaults, and require the depository to give another and substituted
bond, need not be considered, for no such application
or showing appears to have been attempted.

Counsel for Parties.

While the bond was under seal we need not consider
the effect to be given to this under the local law, for it
affirmatively appears that the bond was given for a
present and adequate consideration, which leads to the
same result as if the seal were given the effect which
would be accorded to it at, common law.
,It results that the judgment of the court of appeals
must be reversed and that of the district court affirmed.

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

Argued January 5, 6, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. Where there is substantial evidence to support a finding of the
Board of Tax Appeals upon a question of fact, its decision of such
question is conclusive upon review. P. 40.
2. Held, there was substantial evidence in this case to support the
finding of the Board in respect to the March 1, 1913 value of

cemetery lots subsequently disposed, of, and the reversal of its
decision of that question by the Circuit Court of Appeals amounted
to an unwarranted substitution of the court's judgment concerning
facts for that of the Board. P. 40.
