The other sections of the Act are consistent with this
construction of § 305. Section 307 permits the insured,
if totally disabled, to make claim under his converted
policy and entitles him to the benefits of that policy "if
found entitled thereto." See United States v. Arzner, 287
U. S. 470, 473. But it is plain that respondent is not
"entitled" to total disability benefits under the original
policy, within the meaning of § 307, because the total
disability did not occur until after its conversion. Section
307 does not, either by its terms or by reasonable implication, extend the privileges of § 305 to converted insurance. The legislative history of § 307 does not disclose
any purpose to amend § 305, or to depart from its policy,
and in any case the modification by implication of the
settled construction of an earlier and different section is
not favored. United States v. Munday, 222 U. S. 175,

limited to the lapsed twenty-payment life policy.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 614.

Argued March 12, 1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

1. That part of the National Firearms Act which provides that every
dealer in firearms shall register and shall pay an annual tax of $200
or be subject to fine and imprisonment, is a valid exercise of the
taxing power of Congress. Pp. 511 et seq.
The term "firearm" is defined by § 1 of the Act as meaning a
shotgun or rifle having a barrel less than eighteen inches in length,
or any other weapon, except a pistol or revolver, from which a shot
is discharged by an explosive, if capable of being concealed on the
person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any
firearm.

2. Congress may select the subjects of taxation, choosing some and
omitting other,. It may impose excise taxes on the doing of
business. P. 512.
:3.
The tax upon dealers, supra, is not in the category of penalties
imposed for the enforcement of regulations beyond the scope of
congressional power. P. 513.
4. A tax may have regulatory effects and may burden, restrict or
suppress the thing taxed, and still be within the taxing power.
P. 513.
5. Courts may not inquire into the motives of Congress in exercising
its powers; they will not undertake, by collateral inquiry as to the
measure of the regulatory effect of a tax, to ascribe to Congress an
attempt, under the guise of taxation, to exercise another power
denied by the Federal Constitution. P. 513.
6. The Court declines to consider petitioner's contentions not supported by assignment of error. P. 514.

An exaction, called a tax, which is in fact and effect a
penalty, is not a tax. While the lawmaker is entirely
free to ignore the ordinary meaning of words and make
definitions of his own, that device may not be employed
so as to change the nature of acts or things to which the
words are applied. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., supra;

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Argument for Petitioner.

300 U. S.

The Constitution made no grant of authority to
Congress to legislate substantively for the general welfare, and no such authority exists, save as the general
welfare may be promoted by the exercise of the powers
which are granted. Cases supra.
The power of taxation which is expressly granted may
be adopted as a means to carry into operation another
power also expressly granted, but resort to the taxing
power to effectuate an end which is not legitimate, not
within the scope of the Constitution, is obviously inadmissible. Cases supra.
If the Constitution, in its grant of powers, is to be so
construed as to carry into full effect the power granted,
it is equally imperative that, where a prohibition or limitation is placed upon the power of Congress, that prohibition or limitation should be enforced in its spirit
and to its entirety. Fairbanksv. United States, 181 U. S.
312.
A mere reading of the National Firearms Act discloses
that it was enacted for the purpose of regulating or suppressing traffic in the firearms described in the Act; that
it was not enacted for the purpose of collecting any taxes;
that it was passed as a police measure, as an aid to local
law enforcement, and not as a revenue law. While it is
true that, where the law merely imposes the tax without
disclosing the indirect purpose of its imposition, the
courts might hesitate to declare the law unconstitutional,
on the other hand, if the real purpose of the law is disclosed on its face to be a purpose that invades the police
powers reserved to the individual States, the courts should
not hesitate to declare the Act an unconstitutional usurpation by the Federal Government of powers reserved to
the States by the Tenth Amendment. Cooley, Const. L.,
pp. 56-60; Citizens Savings & Loan Assn. v. Topeka, 20
Wall. 655; Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678.

SONZINSKY v. UNITED STATES.
506

Argument for Petitioner.

Under the American constitutional system, the police
power, being an attribute of sovereignty inherent in the
original States, and not delegated by the Federal Constitution to the United States, remains with the individual States. New Orleans Gas Light Co. v. LouisianaLight
Co., 115 U. S. 650; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S.
461; United States v. L. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540.'
Whatever may be the motive or pretext of a statute, or
in whatever language it may be framed, its real purpose
and the question of its validity must be determined by its
natural and reasonable effect to be ascertained from its
practical operation. Henderson v. New York, 92 U. S.
259; Morgan's Co. v. Board of Health, 118 U. S. 455;
Collins v. New Hampshire, 171 U. S. 30; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623; Fairbanks v. United States, 181 U. S.
283; Postal Telegraph Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688.
It is apparent from reading the National Firearms Act
that Congress had no intention of framing a law that
would procure any revenue for the Government. In the
instant case, the effect of the application of the law to
petitioner is to require him to pay a dealer's annual tax
of $200.00 and to pay a transfer tax of an additional
$200.00 for the privilege of handling and selling a commodity of the value of only $10.00. The Act further subjects petitioner to the payment of a fine and to imprisonment of not to exceed five years if he should fail to pay
the penalties required of him. These facts demonstrate,
without the possibility of contradiction, that the purpose
was not not to tax a business, but to prohibit it. It is inconceivable that anyone would anticipate that a dealer
within the definition of s 2 of the Act could possibly pay
the penalty required by the Act. The amount of a levy
that a statute makes upon business frequently forms the
basis of jurisdictional action and determines the validity

of legislation. The courts have found no insuperable
difficulty in determining the difference between a tax and
a penalty. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20;
Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, 190
U. S. 160; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466; Linder v. United
States, 268 U. S. 5.
The classification made by the Act is arbitrary and
unreasonable. It discriminates against one dealer in
favor of another, without stating any justification for so
doing. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S.
540; Oliver v. Washington Mills, 11 Allen 265.
It is the duty of a reviewing court to review the testimony and reverse the conviction if there is no evidence
whatever to support it. Miles v. United States, 103 U. S.
304; Degnan v. United-States, 271 Fed. 291; Applebaum
v. United States, 274 Fed. 43.
.Assistant Attorney General McMahon, with whom Solicitor General Reed and Messrs. Gordon Dean and William W. Barron were on the brief, for the United States.
The authority of Congress to enact this statute is
found in Art. I, § 8, cl. 1 of the Constitution.
It is no objection that the size of the tax tends to burden and discourage the conduct of the occupation of petitioner. Cf. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40. Nor
is it material that Congress may have anticipated and
even intended such an effect. Where a tax is laid on a
proper subject and discloses a revenue purpose, it is of no
consequence that social, or moral, or economic factors
may have been considered by Congress in enacting the
measure. McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27; United
States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86; Nigro v. United States,
276 U. S. 332; Hampton & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S.
394. The cases relied upon by petitioner are distinguishable. They involve penalties for failure to comply with

SONZINSKY v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

federal regulations deemed to be beyond the power of
Congress.
Petitioner's contention that the statute involves an
unreasonable classification is merely an attack on the selection by Congress of the objects of taxation, and is untenable. His further insistence that the evidence does not
support the judgment of conviction presses a contention
not within the limits of the order granting the writ of
certiorari.
MR.

JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question for decision is whether § 2 of the National
Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, c. 757, 48 Stat. 1236, 26
U. S. C., §§ 1132-1132 q, which imposes a $200 annual
license tax on dealers in firearms, is a constitutional exercise of the legislative power of Congress.
Petitioner was convicted by the District Court for
Eastern Illinois on two counts of an indictment, the first
charging him with violation of § 2, by dealing in firearms
without payment of the tax. On appeal the Court of
Appeals set aside the conviction on the second count and
affirmed on the first. 86 F. (2d) 486. On petition of the
accused we granted certiorari, limited to the question of
the constitutional validity of the statute in its application
under the first count in the indictment.
Section 2 of the National Firearms Act requires every
dealer in firearms to register with the Collector of Internal
Revenue in the district where he carries on business, and
to pay a special excise tax of $200 a year. Importers or
manufacturers are taxed $500 a year. Section 3 imposes
a tax of $200 on each transfer of a firearm, payable by
the transferor, and § 4 prescribes regulations for the identification of purchasers. The term "firearm" is defined
by § 1 as meaning a shotgun or a rifle having a barrel less
than eighteen inches in length, or any other weapon, ex-

cept a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged
by an explosive, if capable of being concealed on the
person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or
silencer for any firearm. As the conviction for nonpayment of the tax exacted by § 2 has alone been sustained, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the different
tax levied by § 3 and the regulations pertaining to it are
valid. Section 16 declares that the provisions of the Act
are separable. Each tax is on a different activity and is
collectible independently of the other. Full effect may
be given to the license tax standing alone, even though
all other provisions are invalid. Welter v. New York, 268
U. S. 319; Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 697; cf. Champlin
Refining Co. v. Commission, 286 U. S. 210, 234.
In the exercise of its constitutional power to lay taxes,
Congress may select the subjects of taxation, choosing
some and omitting others. See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,
220 U. S. 107, 158; Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 516;
Bromley v. McCaughn, 280 U. S. 124. Its power extends
to the imposition of excise taxes upon the doing of business. See License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462; Spreclles
Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, 192 U. S. 397, 412;
United States v. Doremils, 249 U. S. 86, 94. Petitioner
does not deny that Congress may tax his business as a
dealer in firearms. He insists that the present levy is
not a true tax, but a penalty imposed for the purpose of
suppressing traffic in a certain noxious type of firearms,
the local regulation of which is reserved to the states because not granted to the national government. To
establish its penal and prohibitive character, he relies
on the amounts of the tax imposed by § 2 on dealers,
manufacturers and importers, and of the tax imposed by
§ 3 on each transfer of a "firearm," payable by the
transferor. The cumulative effect on the distribution of
a limited class of firearms, of relatively small value, by
the successive imposition of different taxes, one on the

Opinion of the Court.

business of the importer or manufacturer, another on
that of the dealer, and a third on the transfer to a buyer,
is said to be prohibitive in effect and to disclose unmistakably the legislative purpose to regulate rather than
to tax.
The case is not one where the statute contains regulatory provisions related to a purported tax in such a
way as has enabled this Court to say in other cases that
the latter is a penalty resorted to as a means of enforcing
the regulations. See Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S.
20, 35; Hill v. Wallace, 259 U. S. 44; Carter v. Cqrter
Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238. Nor is the subject of the tax
described or treated as criminal by the taxing statute.
Compare United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287.
Here § 2 contains no regulation other than the mere
registration provisions, which are obviously supportable
as in aid of a revenue purpose. On its face it is only a
taxing measure, and we are asked to say that the tax,
by virtue of its deterrent effect on the activities taxed,
operates as a regultion which is beyond the congressional power.
Every tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity
taxed as compared with others not taxed. But a tax is
not any the less a tax because it has a regulatory effect,
United States v. Doremus, supra, 93, 94; Nigro v. United
States, 276 U. S. 332, 353, 354; License Tax Cases, supra;
see Child Labor Tax Case, supra, 38; and it has long been
established that an Act of Congress which on its face
purports to be an exercise of the taxing power is not any
the less so because the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the thing taxed. Veazie Bank v. Fenno,
8 Wall. 533, 548; McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27,
60-61; cf. Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S. 44, 48.

not undertake, by collateral inquiry as to the measure
of the regulatory effect of a tax, to ascribe to Congress an
attempt, under the guise of taxation, to exercise another
power denied by the Federal Constitution. McCray v.
United States, supra; cf. lllagnano Co. v. Hanilton,
supra, 45.
Here the annual tax of $200 is productive of some revenue.' We are not free to speculate as to the motives
which moved Congress to impose it, or as to the extent
to which it may operate to restrict the activities taxed.
As it is not attended by an offensive regulation, and since
it operates as a tax, it is within the national taxing power.
