UNITED STATES v. MADIGAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 562.

Argued March 10, 1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

1. The provisions of § 305 of the World War Veterans' Act, as
amended, whereby a policy which has lapsed while the insured
was suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected may be revived and matured, pro tanto, if
the insured has become permanently disabled, by applying the
uncollected compensation as premiums, do not extend to an earlier
policy which was converted into the one that lapsed. P. 502.
2. In the congressional legislation dealing with the subject, Veterans'
insurance changed from one form to another is termed "converted." P. 503.
3. Neither the words nor the legislative history of § 305 of the
Act suggest that the phrase "canceled or reduced insurance" was
intended to include insurance elsewhere described in the Act as
"converted," at least where the conversion was not accompanied
by a reduction of the policy. P. 505.
4. The holder of a converted policy is not "entitled" to total
disability benefits under the original policy, within the meaning of
§ 307 of the Act, as amended in 1930, where the total disability
did not occur until after the conversion. P. 506.
5. Section 307 does not, either by its terms or by reasonable implication, extend the privileges of § 305 to converted insurance. Its
legislative history does not disclose any purpose to amend, or to
depart from the policy of § 305. P. 506.
6. A construction of a new section added to an existing statute, as
by implication modifying a settled construction of an earlier section, is not favored. P. 506.
85 F. (2d) 609, reversed.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Respondent brought this suit in the District Court for
Southern California to recover total permanent disability
benefits under a contract of war risk term insurance.
While in the military service of the United States in the
World War, he acquired a term policy of war risk insurance. On November 1, 1919, availing himself of the
benefits of § 404 of the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, 410, he converted his
term insurance into a twenty-payment life policy of
United Stats Government insurance. He paid premiums
on this policy until January 31,49261; when it was allowedto lapse for non-payment of premiums. On the date of
the conversion of his first policy, he was suffering from a
"compensable disability," and, after the lapse of the
second, on June 6, 1925, he was rated by the Veterans'
Bureau as totally and permanently disabled. At that
time he was entitled to disability compensation from the
Government in the sum of $312.25.
On the trial in the district court a jury was waived and
the case was heard on an agreed statement of facts. The
court gave judgment for the respondent for permanent
disability benefits under his first policy, with respect to
so much of the insurance as the $312.25 of disability compensation, remaining uncollected at the time of total permanent disability, would have purchased if applied to
the payment of premiums due upon the original policy
between the date of its conversion and the date of total
disability. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed, 85 F. (2d) 609, holding that respondent was en-

titled, under §§ 305, 307 of the World War Veterans' Act,
to revive the original term insurance and to recover under
it the permanent disability benefits awarded by the trial
court. We granted certiorari because of the importance
of the decision of the *Court of Appeals, which conflicts
with the consistent rulings of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, and affects, adversely to the Government,
a large number of pending insurance claims.
Section 305 of the World War Veterans' Act of June
7, 1924, c. 320, 43 Stat. 624, 626, as amended July 2, 1926,
c. 723, 44 Stat. 790, 799, 38 U. S. C. § 516, applies to
lapsed, cancelled or reduced insurance policies. It provides:
"Where any person has heretofore allowed his insurance to lapse, or has canceled or reduced all or any part
of such insurance, while suffering from a compensable
disability for which compensation was not collected and
dies or has died, or becomes or has become permanently
and totally disabled and at the time of such death or
permanent total disability was or is entitled to compensation remaining uncollected, then and in that event so
much of his insurance as said uncollected compensation, . . . would purchase if applied as premiums when
due, shall not be considered as lapsed, canceled or reduced; and the United States Veterans' Bureau is hereby
authorized and directed to pay to said soldier, or his beneficiaries, as the case may be, the amount, of said insurance . ..
Section 307, as amended July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 991, 1001,
38 U. S. C. § 518, relates to all insurance policies "heretofore or hereafter issued, reinstated or converted." It declares that all such policies shall be incontestable and
provides:
"That, the insured under such contract or policy may,
without prejudicing his rights, elect to make claim to the
bureau or to bring suit under section 19 of this Act on

UNITED STATES v. MADIGAN.

Opinion of the Court.

any prior contract or policy, and if found entitled thereto,
shall, upon surrender of any subsequent contract or policy,
be entitled to payments under the prior contract or
policy . . ."

Respondent elected to claim under his original policy,
presumably because the rate of premiums for the term insurance was lower than for the twenty-payment life policy, and the $312.25 of disability compensation would
purchase a larger amount of the former type than of the
latter. The Government admits that the respondent is
entitled, under § 305, to revive the twenty-payment life
policy which has lapsed, but contends that he is not entitled to revive the earlier term insurance which he had
converted, because § 305 omits any reference to converted
insurance, such as appears in § 307.
All war risk policies were required to be for term insurance by § 404 of the War Risk Insurance Act, but that
section permitted conversion of the insurance into other
forms, after termination of the war. When Congress desired to legislate about one form of insurance thus
changed into another, it explicitly used the descriptive
term "converted."' The omission of any reference to
converted insurance in § 305 indicates that the privilege
of reviving a lapsed, cancelled or reduced policy, was not
intended to extend to an earlier policy converted into
another, whose lapse is the condition of the revival. Such
must be taken to be the meaning if it is consistent with
the purposes of the section, disclosed by its legislative
history and with the provisions of other sections.
See World War Veterans' Act, 1924, § 307, as amended July 3,
1930, 46 Stat. 991, 1001, 38 U. S. C. § 518. Compare World War
Veterans' Act, 1924, § 310, 45 Stat. 970, 38 U. S. C. § 512 a; § 311,
45 Stat. 970, 38 U. S. C. § 512 b; § 302, 43 Stat. 625, 38 U. S. C.
§ 513; § 308, 44 Stat' 790, 800, 38 U. S. C. § 516 a, for legislation
applying the term "converted" to the subsequent, United States
Government life insurance.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

The legislative history supports the government's argument that from the beginning the aim of the legislation
later embodied in § 305 was to permit the veteran to revive his policy when he had allowed it to lapse, for want
of funds, at a time when there was money due him from
the government for a compensable disability. The supposition was that he would have paid the premiums on
the lapsed policy if he had then received the sum due
from the government-a supposition which is inadmissible if, at that time, he had converted low premium term
insurance into any of the other forms of insurance commanding a higher premium, as permitted by § 404.
In its original form, § 305 appeared as a part of § 408
of the War Risk Insurance Act, added by the Act of
August 9, 1921, § 27, c. 57, 42 Stat. 147, 156-157. The
bill which became § 408, as originally reported by the
House Committee, provided for the reinstatement by disabled veterans of their lapsed and cancelled policies.
In recommending this legislation the Conunittee of the
House having it in charge pointed out that most such
lapses and cancellations occurred at a time when disability compensation was due to the veteran, and were
probably occasioned by lack of funds.2 The bill was
amended on the floor of the House' so as to include the
provisions later elaborated into § 305. They permitted
the revival of a lapsed policy in favor of the beneficiaries
of a deceased veteran, if, at the time of the lapse, he had
been: entitled to money from the Government for a com"Report of House Committee, No. 104, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 10,
states: "It would appear to be equitable and fair when it is remembered that as a matter of fact, in most of the instances, the reason
the disabled soldier failed to keep up his insurance was that he was
short of funds and it took the Government some time to investigate
and grant his compensation, and that because of this financial
stringency he allowed his insurance to lapse."

pensable disability.4 The proviso, upon which revival
was conditioned, that at the time of the lapse compensation be due from the Government to the veteran, made
more explicit the purpose indicated in the Committee
Report.'
As then adopted, the revival provision applied only to
lapsed policies, but as amended by the Act of July 2,
1926, it was extended to include "cancelled br reduced"
insurance. This amendment was adopted for the purpose of avoiding a ruling of the Comptroller General that
the phrase "lapsed insurance" did not embrace cancelled
or reduced insurance, even though the cancellation or reduction occurred at a time when compensation was owing
to the veteran. See Report of House Committee, No.
1217, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7-8; Hearings before
Senate Finance Committee, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., on
H. R. 12175, pp. 50-51. Neither the words nor the
legislative history of § 305 suggest that the phrase "canceled or reduced insurance" was intended to include insurance elsewhere described in the Act as "converted,"
at least unless the conversion was accompanied by a reduction of the policy. The like administrative construction which has consistently been given to the section by
the Veterans' Bureau ' is of persuasive force. Norwegian
'Section 408 was amended by the Act of March 4, 1923, c. 291, 42
Stat. 1521, 1525-1526, 'to provide that a lapsed policy could be
revived by one who became permanently and totally disabled.
See 34 Opinions, U. S. Attorneys General, 369, 371.
'See communication of Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to the
Solicitor General, December 5, 1936: ".

.

. it has been the consist-

ent practice of the Veterans' Administration and its predecessors to
administer Section 305, World War Veterans' Act, 1924, and the
preceding provisions of Section 408, War Risk Insurance Act, on the
theory that they contained no provisions, express or implied, for
revival of insurance under a yearly renewable term contract after it
had been converted to a policy of United States Government life
insurance .... "

Syllabus.

Products Co. v. United States, 288 U. S. 294, 315; Brown
v. United States, 113 U. S.568, 571.
The other sections of the Act are consistent with this
construction of § 305. Section 307 permits the insured,
if totally disabled, to make claim under his converted
policy and entitles him to the benefits of that policy "if
found entitled thereto." See United States v. Arzner, 287
U. S. 470, 473. But it is plain that respondent is not
"entitled" to total disability benefits under the original
policy, within the meaning of § 307, because the total
disability did not occur until after its conversion. Section
307 does not, either by its terms or by reasonable implication, extend the privileges of § 305 to converted insurance. The legislative history of § 307 does not disclose
any purpose to amend § 305, or to depart from its policy,
and in any case the modification by implication of the
settled construction of an earlier and different section is
not favored. United States v. Munday, 222 U. S. 175,
182; Ibanez v. Hongkong Banking Corp., 246 U. S.621,
626. The right of respondent to revive his insurance is
limited to the lapsed twenty-payment life policy.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 614.

Argued March 12, 1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

1. That part of the National Firearms Act which provides that every
dealer in firearms shall register and shall pay an annual tax of $200
or be subject to fine and imprisonment, is a valid exercise of the
taxing power of Congress. Pp. 511 et seq.
The term "firearm" is defined by § 1 of the Act as meaning a
shotgun or rifle having a barrel less than eighteen inches in length,
or any other weapon, except a pistol or revolver, from which a shot
is discharged by an explosive, if capable of being concealed on the
person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any
firearm.
