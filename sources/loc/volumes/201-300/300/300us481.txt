HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. TEX-PENN OIL CO.*
CERTIORARI TO THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR T.IIE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 207.

Argued December 14, 1936. Reargued February 1, 2,
1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

1. Findings of circumstantial facts by the Board of Tax Appeals
must be taken as established if supported by substantial evidence.
P. 490.
2. An "ultimate finding" by the Board of Tax Appeals, which is really
a conclusion of law, or a determination of mixed law and fact,
based on the Board's findings of primary, evidentiary or circumstantial facts, is subject to judicial review, and, on such review,
the court may substitute its judgment for that of the Board.
P. 491.
3. In pursuance of a plan of reorganization, the assets of an oil
company, and undivided interests in oil leases owned by individuals, were conveyed to a new company, which delivered part
of its shares and a sum of cash to the old company (later dissolved)
and paid cash to the individuals. The Board of Tax Appeals, after
finding the evidential facts, made an "ultimate finding" that the
consideration moving to the old company from the new one included the cash delivered to the former as well as the shares, and
upon that ground refused to apply the non-recognition of gains
provision (Rev. Act, 1918, § 202 (b); Treas. Reg. 45, Art. 1567),
and allowed deficiency assessments. Held:
(1) The validity of the "ultimate finding" is to be tested by
what in fact was done rather than by the mere form of words
used in the writings employed. P. 493.
(2) The Board's findings of what was actually done show that
the money advanced to the old company was no part of the
consideration for its assets but was part of the consideration for
the individually owned lease interests, and was so advanced, by
direction of the individuals, to pay the old company's debts,

in order that its assets might be conveyed free and clear, as requircd by the plan, and was so applied except a portion which
was returned to the individuals pro rata. P. 491.
4. Another "ultimate finding" of the Board, that the cash received
by three of the individuals from the new company was consideration for both their stock in the old company and their interests in
the leases, is clearly negatived by the circumstantial facts found
by the Board, showing that this stock was assigned to the other
two individuals before the assignment of the lease interests was
made. The fact that the assignment of stock was to be returned
if payment for the assignors' lease interests was not made before a
certain date, did not make the two sales a single or indivisible
transaction. P. 495.
5. A construction of Rev. Act, 1918, § 202 (b), and T. R. 45, Art.
1567, contrary to previous construction and decision, never mentiond or considered in the proceedings under review, but advanced
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the first time in this
Court after certiorari had b.een granted, will not be considered
here. P. 497.
6. Taxpayers are entitled to know the basis of law and fact on which
the Commissioner seeks to sustain deficiency assessments. P. 498.
7. Where shares of stock exchanged by a corporation for the assets
of another corporation were highly speculative and were subject
to a restrictive agreement preventing their sale and did not have
a fair market value, capable of being ascertained with reasonable
certainty, when they were acquired by the taxpayers, held that
their ownership did not lay the basis for a computation of gain
at the time they were received, or for a tax as of that date under
Rev. Act, 1918, § 202 (b); T. R. 45, Art. 1563. P. 499.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

In each of these cases there is involved an item claimed
by petitioner to be taxable income of respondent for
1919. In 1925 the commissioner gave notice of deficiencies. These claims were based on a transaction in 1919
which included transfer by Tex-Penn Oil Company of
all its assets to Transcontinental Oil Company, the issue
and delivery by the latter of 1,007,834 shares to Benedum
and Parriott, the stockholders of Tex-Penn, and the dissolution of that company. The commissioner claims that
the consideration for the transfer included not only the
stock but also $350,000 in cash paid by Transcontinental
to Tex-Penn. Respondents petitioned the Board of Tax
Appeals for redeterminations. The cases were consolidated for hearing; the board made findings of circumstantial facts on the basis of which it concluded in an
"ultimate finding" that the consideration for the transfer
by Tex-Penn to Transcontinental included cash, and that
therefore the transaction was not one in which, under
Revenue Act of 1918, § 202 (b), 40 Stat. 1060, "no gain
or loss shall be deemed to occur." It redetermined deficiencies of $2,871,085, $1,925,466, and $908,470, respectively. 28 B. T. A. 917. Respondents petitioned the
Circuit Court of Appeals for review. It reversed the
orders with directions that the board enter judgments
of no deficiencies. 83 F. (2d) 518.
1. The first ultimate finding is (p. 950): "The consideration received by Tex-Penn on or about August 1, 1919,
in exchange for its assets consisted of $350,000 in cash
and 1,007,834 shares of Transcontinental stock of no par
value."
The first question for decision is whether that conclusion is supported by evidence. If well grounded, the
transaction is not within the non-recognition of gain pro-

vision of § 202 (b). That section declares that "when in
connection with the reorganization, merger or consolidation of a corporation a person receives in place of stock or
securities owned by him new stock or securities of no
greater aggregate par or face value, no gain or loss shall
be deemed to occur from the exchange, and the new stock
or securities received shall be treated as taking the place
of the stock, securities, or property exchanged."
Treasury Regulations 45, Art. 1567,' contains-an interpretation of that provision: "In general where two (or
more) corporations unite their properties by ...the sale
of its property by B to A and the dissolution of B .. .
no taxable income is received from the transaction .. .
provided the sole consideration received by B and its
stockholders . . . is stock . . .of A . . ."
The pertinent substance of the circumstantial facts
found follows:
In 1917 and early 1918, respondents Benedum and Parriott and three others, Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather,
acquired 31 Texas oil and gas leases called the "DukeKnoles" group. The leases reserved to lessors a oneeighth royalty. The interests of the five in what the
findings refer to as the remaining seven-eighths interest
were Benedum six-sixteenths, Parriott and Kirkland
three-sixteenths each, Lantz and Wrather two-sixteenths
each.
'"In general, where two (or more) corporations unite their properties, by either (a) the dissolution of corporation B and the sale of
its assets to corporation A, or (b) the sale of its property by B to A
and the dissolution of B, or (c) the sale of the stock of B to A and
the dissolution of B, or (d) the merger of B into A, or (e) the consolidation of the corporations, no taxable income is received from the
transaction by A or B or the stockholders of either, provided the sole
consideration received by B and its stockholders in (a), (b), (c), and
(d) is stock or securities of A, and by A and B and their stockholders
in (e) is stock or securities of the consolidated corporation, in any
case of no greater aggregate par or face value than the old stock and

securities surrendered. .. "

HELVERING v. TEX-PENN CO.
481

Opinion of the Court.

In October, 1918, they caused Tex-Penn to be incorporated. Its authorized capital stock was $2,000,000, divided into 80,000 shares of $25 each. It issued 4,000
shares for par to the five lease owners ratably according
to their interests; they transferred a fourth interest in
the leases to the company. It agreed to develop the
properties at its own expense; they agreed that one-half
of their shares of the proceeds might be used to make
up deficits in the company's operating expenses.
They authorized Parriott to receive their shares of the
proceeds, to carry out the agreement with the company,
and to invest the remaining half of the proceeds in the
company's stock. Accounts of transactions between the
company and him, as agent, were kept under the name of
"Parriott Attorney." Pursuant to the agreement, he
from time to time purchased at par stock of the company
amounting to 9,120 shares; it used the money in developing the leased properties.
Benedum and Parriott were also interested as owners
in the Riverside Eastern Oil Company, the Riverside
Western Oil Company, and the Pittsburgh-Texas Oil
& Gas Company. In early 1919, they decided to
cause to be organized the Transcontinental Oil Company
to acquire and operate the properties of these companies
and of Tex-Penn together with the individually owned
interests in the leases. Benedum's four associates, by
writing dated June 2, 1919, gave him authority to sell
the assets of Tex-Penn and all individual interests in the
leases for $12,000,000 and agreed .to accept their pro rata
share of the net proceeds of the sale 'for their holdings
in Tex-Penn and their individual interests in the leases.
To arrange for money with which to carry out the
project, Benedum negotiated with bankers. Under the
first plan, the bankers were to pay Transcontinental
$23,000,000 for a part of its stock, and that amount was to
be used to pay the $12,000,000, and $2,500,000 in equal
parts to Riverside Eastern and Riverside Western to

retire preferred stock. The balance, $8,500,000, was to
be retained by Transcontinental for working capital. By
a later arrangemenit the amount to be paid by the bankers
was reduced to $20,000,000 and that to be received by the
five individuals to $9.000,000. Benedum's associates declined to accept less than their proportionate share of
$12,000,000 as originally planned. In order that the undertaking should not fail, Benedum agreed to diminish
by $3,000,000 the amount he was to have and so bore
the entire reduction. On that basis, distribution of the
$9,00,000 would be $1,500,000 each to Benedum, Lantz
and Wrather and $2,250,000 each to Parriott and
Kirkland.
Transcontinental was organized and authorized to issue
2,000,000 no-par-value shares, of which the bankers
agreed to buy 500,000 at $40 per share. They exercised
an option to buy 225,000 additional shares at $1.00 per
share. Tex-Penn's assets were to pass to Transcontinental free and clear of all liabilities. July 12, Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather assigned and delivered their
Tex-Pein shares to Beneduni and Parriott for $30.
'The terms of the transfers were evidenced by two letters to Parriott accOml)anving delivery of the assignments. Words within
brackets were in the first letter but not in the second; words in italics
were in the second letter but not in the first.
"In connection with the assignment we have executed today, transferring to . . . Transcontinental . . . all of our right, title and interest in the oil and gas leases ....
we are assigning and hand you
herewith our shares of stock . . . Tex-Penn . . . which we hereby
agree to sell to you and Al. L. Benedum jointly for a considerationof
$5.00 payable to each of us. If for any reason the proposed organization of . . . Transcontinental... should not go through, this
stock is to be returned to us.
"We understand that you and Mr. Benedum are transferring
to . . . Transcontinental . . . a considerable amount of property
that you and he own . . . including your interests in the Tex-Penn
leases, and that you and he are to be paid for all these properties

HELVERING v. TEX-PENN CO.
481

Opinion of the Court.

July 15, the stock was transferred on the Tex-Penn stock
book. July 22, new directors were elected to take the
places of the assignors who, as stated in the minutes, had
ceased to be stockholders.
July 14, the individual owners and Tex-Penn e.:ecuted
an assignment to Transcontinental of all their interest
in the leases and gave it to Parriott in escrow for delivery upon payment of $5,250,000 to Kirkland, Lantz
and Wrather, or to Parriott for their account. They
stipulated that if payment was not made by August 1,
the assignment and stock would be returned to them.
And, in order that Tex-Penn assets might be free from
liability, they authorized Parriott to deduct from their
shares seven-sixteenths of not exceeding $500,000 to pay
debts and obligations of the company. Benedum and
Parriott were to bear nine-sixteenths: The auditor of
Tex-Penn reported that approximately $350,000 would
be required.
July 24, Benedum and Parriott made a, contract with
J. M. Holliday, acting for the bankers and Transcontinental, in which they agreed to transfer to Transcontinental their interests in the leases for $3,400,000 in
cash, to cause Tex-Penn to transfer to Transcontinental
all its assets "for and in consideration of . . . $350,000 in
cash and . . . 1,007,834 shares' of the capital stock
of . . . Transcontinental," and to cause Kirkland, Lantz
and Wrather to transfer to Transcontinental their sevensixteenths of the five-eighths interest in the leases for
$5,250,000 in cash.
The same day, Holliday addressed an offer to Tex-Penn
to purchase all its assets "for . . . $350,000 in cash
partly in cash and partly in stock of . . . Transcontinental ...
Our entire interests in the stock of the Tex-Penn Company and in the
leases covered by the assignment above referred to are paid for in
full by the [$5,250,000 that is to be paid us in this transaction.]

and . . . 1,007,834 shares" of Transcontinental. By resolution of its directors, Tex-Penn accepted the offer, referring to the consideration as "$350,000 cash and...
1007,834 shares" of Transcontinental. It was further resolved that, after the transfer of its property, the collection
of debts due, and payment of those owed by, Tex-Penn, it,
would be dissolved and its assets distributed to its stockholders "and that to facilitate this, the . . . officers . . .
direct Mr. Holliday that . . . $350,000 . . shall be
paid to the treasury of this company, and that the . . .
shares . . .be issued and delivered to" Benedum and
Parriott jointly.
July 30, Tex-Penn conveyed its assets to Transcontinental. Hlolliday directed the latter to deliver to
Benedum and Parriott jointly certificates for 1,007,834
shares, to deliver $5,250,000 to Parriott Attorney,
$3,400,000 to Benedum and Parriott and $350,000 to
Tex-Penn. The next day, these directions were carried
out by Transcontinental.
There was available for use by Tex-Penm in payment
of its expenses $286,891.29, derived from one-half of the
proceeds from the individually owned five-eighths interest
in the leases. It also had receivables and oil and the
$350,000 with which to discharge its liabilities. The
$350,000 was deducted by Transcontinental from the
amount to be paid Benedum and Parriott for their interest. in the leases. But that deduction was in fact
borne not by them alone but ratably by the five owners.
Payment. of Tex-Penn's liabilities did not require use of
all the $350,000. There remained $55,255.24. And that
sum was distributed to the five individuals according to
their interests in the leases.
Details are reflected in the accounts of "Parriott Attorney." Kirkland was given credit for $2,250,000 and
Lantz and Wrather for $1,500,000 each as purchase prices
of their shares of the five-eighths interest in the leases.

HELVERING v. TEX-PENN CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Each of the five, according to his interest in the leases,
was charged with his share of the $350,000 with the explanation that "this

amount was to be apportioned

against the sale price received by all the individual
interests."
In respect of the transfer of the Tex-Penn stock by
Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather to Benedum and Parriott,
the latter were charged $15 each and correspondingly
each of the former was credited with $10. At the end
of the year, Parriott furnished annual statements to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather, showing the sale prices of their
interests in the leases reduced by their contributions to
the $350,000. The sales price of the stock sold by them
was shown at $30.
'This corrected an entry of August 1 which charged Tex-Penn with
the $350,000 and credited $140,000 to Benedum and $210,000 to Parriott with the explanation that the $350,000 had been taken out of
their share of the purchase price of the Duke-Knoles properties. The

Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

On partial distributions by Parriott before final settlement, Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather gave receipts similar in form. That of Kirkland recited that the payment was on account of the purchase price of his interest
"in and to . . . the leases . . . and to the stock of the
Tex-Penn. . . . The balance . . . is to be retained until
the final adjustment of the taxes and the affairs of
Tex-Penn . . . at the conclusion of which the said balance is to be paid to me, less my proportionate share of
said expenses." Kirkland and Lantz died before the
hearing. Wrather testified that he attached no great
importance to the form of the receipt; that he knew there
had been in form separate transfers of the lease interests
and the Tex-Penn stock but that he and his associates
considered only the ultimate objective.
Benedum and Parriott in their 1919 income tax returns
reported their own profits from the sale of their lease interests upon the basis of the total price of $8,650,000.
Tex-Penn's return stated that it had sold its assets for
$350,000 cash and shares of stock. It also stated that
the cost of the assets sold was $2,359,205.69, from which
it deducted $350,000, leaving $2,009,205.69, and that
amount was designated "value of stock." Neither the
$350,000 nor the stated "value of stock" received was included in gross income. A schedule attached to the return stated that the cash consideration was accounted
for in the return, and that the "no par value stock" received was not taxable income under § 202 (b) and
T. D. 2924.
The foregoing includes the substance of all the findings of circumstantial facts material to the question
under consideration. They must be taken as established
if supported by substantial evidence. Helvering v.

Opinion of the Court.

589, 600. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279
U. S. 716. There is no suggestion that they are not
amply sustained. In addition to and presumably upon
the basis of these findings, the board made its "ultimate
finding." And upon that determination it ruled that
the transaction was not within the non-recognition provisions of § 202 (b). The ultimate finding is a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed
question of law and fact. It is to be distinguished from
the findings of primary, evidentiary or circumstantial
facts. It is subject to judicial review and, on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of
the board. Helvering v. Rankin, ubi supra.
Treating the transaction as a part of reorganization,
merger or consolidation, the board concluded that cash
constituted a part of the consideration. The opinion refers to writings above mentioned and emphasizes their
provisions that state or indicate that the consideration
was or did ilclude cash and stock. The documents cited
are the agreement for the transfer of Tex-Penn's assets
to Transcontinental, the offer to Tex-Penn, the resolution
of its directors accepting the offer and directing payment
of the $350,000 to its treasury. Holliday's letter directing
Transcontinental so to pay, Transcontinental's check for
that amount to Tex-Penn and the latter's tax return.
But the board's findings of what was actually done
show that, pursuant to direction of the individuals selling
lease interests, Transcontinental advanced to Tex-Penn
$350,000 and deducted that amount from the price of the
lease interests. The findings also show that, for the part
of that amount remaining after payment of its debts, TexPenn accounted to the individuals.
As indirectly showing that the $350,000 constituted
part of the consideration for transfer of Tex-Penn assets,
the opinion cites the entry in the "Parriott Attorney"
accounts showing that the effect of the payment of that

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.

300 U. S.

sum to Tex-Penn was to reduce the sale price of the
interest in the leases from $9,000,000 to $8,650,000, the
entries distributing that amount to the five individuals,
and the tax returns of Benedum, Parriott and Tex-Penn.
Petitioner does not bring forward these entries or the
tax returns of Benedum and Parriott to support the
board's ultimate finding now under consideration. Manifestly, the entries referred to in the board's opinion are
opposed to its conclusion. As will more fully appear,
upon an examination of them later to be made, the findings of details make it plain that the $350,000 was a part
of the consideration paid for the individually owned lease
interests and leave no ground for any other inference.
The board's opinion shows that both parties relied
on art. 1567 as a correct interpretation of the statute.
The-board held (p. 959) that it "requires, as a condition
of nonrecognition of gain, that the sole consideration be
stock or securities . . . The written agreements herein
indicate clearly that there was a cash consideration to
Tex-Penn of $350,000. We are not convinced by the oral
evidence that that was not a fact. Accordingly, we hold
that the petitioners have not brought themselves within
section 202 (b) . . .and article 1567... so as to escape
recognition of gain."
The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, after discussion of primary or evidentiary facts found by the
board, states, 83 F. (2d) at p. 522: "A consideration of
all the documentary evidence drives us to the conclusion
that the $350,000 was not consideration passing from
Transcontinental to Tex-Penn, but was money furnished
by the lessees as individuals to pay the debts of TexPenn so that the transaction might be made according
to agreement . . . In form the documents upon which
the Board of Tax Appeals relied stated that the $350,000
was corporate consideration passing from Transcontinental, but in fact, it was not, and the rule is well settled
that in determining tax liability, taxing authorities must

Opinion of the Court.

look through form to fact and substance. It has been a
long time since these transactions took, place and most
of the parties who were interested in them are dead, but
every living person who was in any way connected with
them testified without contradiction that the $350,000
was paid by the five lessees and not by Transcontinental."
The validity of the ultimate finding above quoted is to
be tested by what in fact was done rather than by the
mere form of words used in the writings employed.
United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 168. Curran v.
Commissioner, 49 F. (2d) 129, 131. The board's findings
of circumstantial facts definitely show the substance of
the transaction as actually consummated. Summarily
stated, the details of controlling significance are these:
The bankers bought from Transcontinental 725,000
shares of its stock for $20,225,000. Transcontinental paid
and issued its stock:

Included in the total was $9,000,000 to pay for the individually owned five-eighths interest in the leases and
$2,500,000 to retire preferred stock of Riverside Eastern
and Riverside Western, and $5,250,000 to pay for sevensixteenths of the five-eighths interest: $2,250,000 to Kirkland and $1,500,000 each to Lantz and Wrather. The
remaining $3,750,000 was to pay Benedum and Parriott
for their nine-sixteenths: $1,500,000 to Benedum for his
six-sixteenths and $2,250,000 to Parriott for his threesixteenths.
The $350,000 received by Tex-Penn from Transcontinental was to be used to the extent needed to pay Tex-

Penn's debts in order that its assets should be free and
clear of liabilities. But no part of that amount was borne
by Transcontinental. Upon authorization of Benedum
and Parriott, it deducted that amount from the $3,750,000 payable by it to them. And, by arrangement among
themselves, the five individuals were chargeable with the
$350,000 according to their interests in the leases:

48 t

Opinion of the Court.

The board's findings of evidentiary details not only fail
to support, but definitely negative, its conclusion that
the consideration received by Tex-Penn in exchange for
its assets included $350,000 in cash.
Essential to the project was the transfer to Transcontinental of Tex-Penn assets free from claims, and equally
indispensable was the transfer of the individually owned
lease interests. Tex-Penn needed money to satisfy demands of its creditors. Should it be unable to free its
property from liability, the entire enterprise might fail.
In that event, the individuals would lose the sale of their
lease interests. And so, they decided to provide the cash
needed by Tex-Penn to clear its assets and for that purpose they caused Transcontinental to advance Tex-Penn
the $350,000 and deduct it from $9,000,000, the price it
was to pay them for their lease interests. The excess,
$55,255.24, was ratably distributed as shown above. No
part of the $350,000 was included in or had any relation
to the consideration for the transfer of the Tex-Penn
assets. In legal effect, the details found by the board to
have been carried out are not to be distinguished froma
direct advance by the five individuals to Tex-Penn of
the money required to pay its debts. Unquestionably,
such .an advance would not constitute consideration received by Tex-Penn. As against the board's findings
showing what was actually done in consummation of the
transaction, no weight as evidence can be given to mere
recitals, directions, engagements and admissions of respondents contained in the documents relied on by the
board. It should have held that the Transcontinental
stock was the sole consideration for the transfer of the
Tex-Penn assets. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly
held that the ruling to the contrary was erroneous.
2. The board's second ultimate finding is (p. 950).
"The cash received by Wrather, Lantz and Kirkland
from Transcontinental was consideration for both their

496

300 U. S.

stock in Tex-Penn and their interests in the DukeKnoles leases." The board (p. 959) deemed that conclusion an additional ground for its ruling that the transaction is not within the non-recognition provisions of
§ 202 (b). In support of that view the commissioner
maintains that "the nominal sale of sto*ck, the transfer
of the assets of Tex-Penn.; and the sale of the individual
interests in the leases, constituted a single indivisible
transaction."
But the circumstantial facts clearly negative this ultimate finding. Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather sold their
Tex-Penn stock to Benedum and Parriott and their lease
interests to Transcontinental. The stock was sold and
delivered before the assignment of the lease interests was
made. The transfer on the company's stock book was
effected, and their connection as stockholders and directors was terminated, while the lease interests were being
held until paid for by Transcontinental. The stipulation
that, if payment for their lease interests was not made
by August 1, the assignment of their shares of stock
would be returned, did not make the two sales a single
or indivisible transaction. Assuming that Kirkland,
Lantz and Wrather would not have sold their Tex-Penn
stock without also selling their lease interests, that fact
would not convert the twoi sales into one. The purpose
of the stipulation is plain. If Transcontinental did not
pay for and take the lease interests and Tex-Penn continued to operate the properties, they. would again become stockholders and have a voice in the operation.
On the point under consideration, the commissioner's
position before the board is not in harmony with his contention here. There he made four computations: two
were of Tex-Penn taxes, the other two were respectively
those of the other respondents. In all his calculations,
he attributed to the consideration for Tex-Penn assets
the 1,007,834 shares of Transcontinental and to the

HELVERING v. TEX-PENN CO.
481

Opinion of the Court.

Benedum and Parriott lease interests their shares of the
cash, $9,000,000, less the amount thereof used to pay
Tex-Penn debts. All these shares went to Benedum and
Parriott who owned all the Tex-Penn stock. The deficiencies claimed by the commissioner and the amounts
determined by the board rest upon the fact that Benedum
and Parriott as the only stockholders of Tex-Penn became
the owners of the 1,007,834 Transcontinental shares.
And, as shown by the board's findings, the balance of the
cash without more went to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather
for their lease interests.
It is immaterial whether $30 was sufficient fully to
compensate them for their Tex-Penn stock. The findings
show the transfer was valid. Invalidating disparity between worth and consideration is not disclosed, and may
not be assumed. Indeed, the commissioner's brief states
that Tex-Penn was organized to develop the leases which
were the personal property of its five stockholders; it
"was not expected to operate at a profit ... and actually
it could not operate at a profit... It was useful chiefly in
connection with the five-eighths royalties in the DukeKnoles field held individually by its stockholders."
And respondents call attention to findings disclosing operating results that point in the same direction.
We find nothing in the circumstantial facts found or in
the evidence to support the board's conclusion that Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather received from Transcontinental
any cash for their stock in Tex-Penn. It cannot be
sustained.
3. The commissioner seeks reversal upon the grounds
that the transaction was not a tax-exempt reorganization because Tex-Penn sought to realize a profit rather
than merely to change the form of its ownership and
that § 202 (b) does not exempt from taxation exchanges
of property for stock. Specifically he argues that, assuming that the Transcontinental stock was the sole
130607°-37-32

300 U. S.

property exchanged for Tex-Penn assets, the transaction
was not within the non-recognition of gains provision.
Concededly, this contention is contrary to the interpretation put upon § 202 (b) by art. 1567 which was promulgated September 26, 1919 by the commissioner with
the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and has
since been. followed.4 The parties presented their respective claims to the board and to the lower court on the
theory that, if neither Tex-Penn nor its stockholders as
such received any cash from Transcontinental, the transaction would be within § 202 (b). The commissioner's
notices of deficiency 'do not suggest the construction for
which he now contends. He sought no ruling upon the
question from the board or the lower court and is therefore not entitled to have it decided here. Helvering v.
Minnesota Tea Co., 296 U. S. 378, 380. The taxpayers
were entitled to know the basis of law and fact on which
the commissioner sought to sustain the deficiencies. His
failure earlier to present the question leaves this court
without the assistance of decision below. ' His petitions
for these writs did not present the question to this court.
We are not called on to consider the construction of
§ 202 (b) now proposed.'

4. As the sole consideration to Tex-Penn was Transcontinental shares and as Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather
received from Transcontinental no cash for their TexPenn stock, the transaction is within the non-recognition
of gains provisions. The judgments must therefore be
affirmed.
5. The court is also of opinion that the judgments
must be affirmed upon the ground that in the peculiar
circumstances of this case, the shares of Transcontinental
stock, regard being had to their highly speculative quality
and to the terms of a restrictive agreement making a sale
thereof impossible, did not have a fair market value,
capable of being ascertained with reasonable certainty,
when they were acquired by the taxpayers.
In the absence of such value, the ownership of the
shares did not lay the basis for the computation of a
gain at the time they were received, or for a tax as of
that date under the applicable statute. § 202 (b).
