The answer by the state court is broad enough to
cover bank deposits of that sort and we consider the ruling in that application to be contrary to the federal statute. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In the Probate Court, Fairbanks, Alaska,-October,
1934,-a contest arose over the appointment of a guardian for two minor children. Petitioner's application
failed. Respondent was designated. The District Court
heard the matter de novo and approved this action.
Upon motion, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The motion averred: (1) the cause involves no
question arising under theAonstitution, statute or treaty
of the United States, or any authority exercised thereunder; (2) no monel y'v,.u exceeding $1,000.00 is involved; (3) the petitibner.*s not a party in the Probate
Court. Section 128, Judicial Code,1 also § 943, Act of
June 6, 1900,2 were relied upon in opposition.
'Judicial Code, § 128, 28 U. S. C. § 225; Act March 3, 1911,
amended Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936:

exceeds $1,000; in all other criminal cases where the offense charged
is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or by
death, and in all habeas corpus proceedings; and in the district

SUMI v. YOUNG.

Opinion of the Court.

The Circuit Court of Appeals could find no question
under the Constitution, statute or treaty of the United
States, or authority exercised thereunder; nor any controversy concerning money, property, or property rights.
It concluded that § 128, Judicial Code, gave no jurisdiction; also that § 943, Act June 6, 1900, confers none
since it only directs that orders of the District Court of
Alaska in probate cases shall be deemed judgments subject to appeal as provided by § 128.
The petitioner insists that the cause involves construction and application of several sections Alaska Civil
Code, 3 and that jurisdiction is conferred by § 128; also
that § 943, Act June 6, 1900, is applicable.
Considering Summers v. United States, 231 U. S. 92,
we cannot regard provisions of the Alaska Civil Code as
laws of the United States within the intendment of § 128.
They are special or local laws designed to meet conditions
peculiar to that Territory. It follows that this section
does not authorize the appeal under consideration. This
view is aided by the words "in all other civil cases wherein
the value in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs,
exceeds $1,000

. .

. and in all habeas corpus proceed-

ings." If every case arising under the Civil Code involves
a statute of the United States, this clause is inappropriate.
Moreover, to bring within the appellate jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court of Appeals every order of the District
Court of Alaska concerning guardianship claims against
estates, distributions, etc., would hinder the manifest purwhich order shall be entered in a docket to be kept by the clerk
of the court for that purpose, properly indexed, and a copy of the
same shall be forwarded to the commissioner before whom the exceptions were filed, who shall thereupon proceed in accordance with
such order. Such orders shall be deemed a judgment, subject to
appeal in the manner provided for appeals from judgments in the
District Court."

pose to limit and definitely establish the jurisdiction of
that Court disclosed by Judicial Code, 1911, and the
amending Act of 1925. The Alaska Civil Code is an elaborate Act of Congress-230 printed pages--which undertakes to prescribe the law on a great many subjects.
The provision of § 943, Act of June 6, 1900, applicable
to appeals in probate cases in Alaska, appears in the
margin, ante note 2.
Counsel maintain that this must be interpreted as if it
read:
"An order of the District Court made in a probate
case on appeal to it, shall be deemed a judgment. Such
judgment is appealable. The manner or mode of taking
and perfecting such appeal shall be the same manner or
mode which is provided for the taking and perfecting of
an appeal from other appealable judgments made and
entered in the District Court."
This proposal is in conflict with the purpose and limitations of the later Acts of 1911 and 1925. These are
of general application, and any provision of the Alaska
Code concerning appeals .to the Circuit Court of Appeals
inconsistent with them is ineffective.
Moreover, we cannot accept the view that the words
"in the manner provided" found in § 943 were intended
to permit appeals in probate matters without restriction-to relieve them of requirements generally applicable to causes in the courts of the Territory.
The court below reached the proper conclusion.
Affirmed.
MR. JtSTICE STONE and MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO concur

in the result, but as they think the case made on the
record is not one "involving" provisions of the Alaska
Code it seems unnecessary to resolve the more doubtful
question whether they are statutes of the United States.
