the District Court could have considered whether justice
would not be done by pursuing such a course, the remedy
in equity being exceptional and the outcome of necessity.
Cf. Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co.,

the court calendar, whether the insurer had been precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other factors.
In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be set off,
the one against the other, and a balance ascertained.

as already indicated, gave that possibility away. They
stipulated that the issues in equity should be tried in advance of .those at law, and that only such issues, if any,
as were left should be disposed of later on. The cases
were allowed to stand as if challenge to the suits had been
made by a demurrer only. So challenged, they prevail.
The decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded

about $9,000 less than the principal debt, exclusive of
all interest. This express finding of the Board of Tax
Appeals, in exact accord with the uncontradicted testimony, was an express finding "upon the ultimate
question of fact upon which the rights of the parties depen(," Botany Mills v. United States, 278 U. S. 282, 290,
which is not open to review here. Botany Mills v.
United States, supra; Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U. S.
589, 600; Burnet v. Leininger, 285 U. S. 136, 138-9.
The company did not "receive," in cash or in property,
the accrued interest or any part thereof and, therefore,
the amount was not "gross income" under § 202, Revenue
Act of 1928.
Indeed, the company actually lost nearly $9,000 of its
principal and its entire $15,538.60 accrued interest-an
actual $24,462.17 total money loss on its mortgage
investment.
The company did not capitalize any part of the delinquent interest; did not treat it as income in any way;
did not, directly or indirectly, carry it as any part of
the cost of the properties or as an asset; and did not include such interest as an asset, or otherwise, in its annual
statement or in its reports to the insurance department.
A "bid" price is not conclusive as to "fair value."
Ballentyne v. Smith, 205 U. S. 285. The bids of a mortgagee and a third party occupy essentially different relations to the property's "fair value" The two situations
are very different. Louisville Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S.
555, 594.
The whole point of the Radford case, supra, was that
no matter what the fair or market value was, the mortgagee had the right to full cash payment, with interest,
or to take the property itself.
So here. The company was unable to collect its debt
with interest in cash. Consequently, it took the proper-

ty; but the act of taking did not establish-certainly did
not conclusively establish-what its "fair value" was.
When a mortgagee. "buys in" property, he does not pay
in cash as a stranger does; neither does he pay his bid
with.anything that is worth in cash even the amount of
the bid-he simply gets the thing pledged, through a
judicial foreclosure sale, instead of by a strict foreclosure.
If, in order to avoid foreclosure expenses, etc., the 'mortgagor voluntarily conveys the property to the mortgagee
in full satisfaction of the debt and interest, and the
property is worth less than the debt, the Commissioner
now concedes that no income has been received, and that
the mortgagee has not "received" any interest. Helvering v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co., 78 F. (2d) 778, 780,
reversing the Board of Tax Appeals' decision (29 B. T. A.
408) in favor of the Commissioner on that point. Cf.
Prudential Insurance Co., 33 B. T. A. 334; American
Central Life Ins. Co., 30 B. T. A. 1190 (a).
Gain or profit is the essential idea of "income"; and in
determining what constitutes "income," substance and
fact rather than form are to be given controlling weight.
The stability of life insurance is based upon the assumption that the company will earn compound interest
at the rate assumed in the calculation of the premium.
The Commissioner's theory that a life insurance coinpany "receives" interest, when, in point of fact, it cannot
collect the interest from the mortgagors and has to take
over real estate of a "fair market value" greatly less than
even the principal of the debt (thereby losing all of its
interest), is obviously untenable, because the company
could not pay its policy claims with such non-existent
purely theoretical interest.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of.the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BR4NDEIS

300 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Since 1921, the Revenue Acts have made this provision
for taxing the income of life insurance companies.' The
gross income is limited to that "received during the taxable year from interest, dividends, and rents." Upon the
net income, ascertained by making prescribed deductions,
the tax under the Act here applicable is 12 per cent.' The
general provisions of the Revenue Acts concerning capital
"gains and losses" and "bad debts" are not applicable to
3
life insurance companies.
In 1930, the M\Iidland M\Iutual Life Insurance Company
of Ohio caused to be foreclosed several mortgages on real
estate given to secure loans which were in default. It was
the only bidder; its bid was accepted; the property was
conveyed to it; and in no case was there redemption. At
each foreclosure sale the company had bid an anount
which included interest as well as the principal. The interest so bid, aggregating on the foreclosed mortgages
$5,456.99, was not included in the company's income tax
return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue decided
that this interest was taxable and, accordingly, determined a deficiency in the company's income tax for 1930.
His determination was approved by the Board of Tax
Appeals. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Board, 83 F. (2d) 629. We granted certiorari
because of conflict with Helvering v. Missouri State Life
' See National Life Insurancc Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 508,

Opinion of the Court.

Ins. Co., 78 F. (2d) 778, and National Life Ins. Co. v.
United States, 4 F. Supp. 1000.
The following additional facts stipulated were adopted
by the Board of Tax Appeals as its findings: The Company kept its books on a "calendar year" "cash receipts
and disbursements" basis, entering only payments of interest actually made to it during the year. Upon its acquiring title to the foreclosed properties, the investments
were transferred on its books from the mortgage loan account to the real estate account and were carried thereon
as assets at amounts which were equal to the principal
of the loans secured by the mortgages plus any disbursements made for taxes, court costs, attorneys fees or insurance premiums. The amount of interest included in
the bids on foreclosure was not carried on the books as
part of the cost of the properties or as an asset. Nor
was it entered on the books or likewise treated as income.
All of the properties here involved were located in States
where a period of redemption from foreclosure is allowed.
The company issued to its representatives having charge
of foreclosures in those States general instructions to
bid on its behalf such sums as would enable the company to realize no loss on account of its investment in
case of redemption. The bids here involved were made
pursuant to those instructions, without regard to the then
actual value of the mortgage property.'
'A large majority of the properties were located in Michigan. By
Michigan law, it is said, the mortgagor is allowed one year from the
date of the foreclosure sale within which he may redeem the property
by paying to the purchaser the amount bid for the property plus
interest from the time of the sale at the rate borne by the mortgage,
even though the amount of such bid be less than the total amount
of the mortgagee's investment in the property. See Comp. Laws
1929, c. 266, §§ 14435, 14436; compare Vosburgh v. Lay, 45 Mich.
455; 8 N. W. 91. The purchaser cannot, under the local law, acquire title until after the expiration of the redemption period. See
Comp. Laws 1929, c. 266, § 14434. The mortgagee may, "fairly and

The company introduced evidence that the fair market
value of the properties was, at the dates of foreclosure
and of acquiring title, less than the amount of the principal due on the mortgages. This evidence was deemed
by the Board immaterial; and it accordingly made no
finding as to fair market value.'
First. The company contends that it did not "receive"
the $5,456.99 (or any part thereof) either in cash or in
property; and, hence, that it was not "g'oss income."
Confessedly no interest was received in cash. The company insists that none was received in property. It
argues that its bid may not be taken as conclusive evidence of the value of the property, invoking Ballentyne
v. Smith, 205 U. S. 285; that the Board's refusal to consider the evidence as to value requires us to hold that the
real estate acquired on foreclosure was of a fair value
less than the amount of the principal of the mortgage
debt; that the proceeds of a mortgage sale must be applied first to the satisfaction of the principal before
income may be held received, citing Doyle v. Mitchell
Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179, i85; and that since the value
did not equal the principal, there were no proceeds of the
sales applicablo to the interest, hence, no taxable income.
In support of this argument, the company points to the
fact that it did not, on its books, treat the -delinquent interest as income; did not, directly or indirectly, carry the
in good faith," bid the property in, (id., § 14432), and he enjoys the
same rights as purchaser as would a thitd party. See Ledyard v.
Phillips, 47 Mich. 305, 308; 11 N. W. 170.
The 6 rder of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the decision of
the Board, remanded the cause for further proceedings. We are
told by counsel for the company that thereafter the Board found, on
the evidence above referred to, that the values of the several properties were less than the principal of the loans. This finding, made
after the filing of the petition for certiorari, though apparently before
its allowance, was not made part of the record. It is, therefore,
disregarded.

interest as part of the cost of the properties or as an asset;
and did not include the interest as an asset in its annual
statement or in its reports to insurance departments.
The arguments rest upon a misconception. The terms
"interest," "dividends," and "rents," employed in the
statute simply and without qualification or elaboration,
were plainly used by Congress in their generic meanings.
as broadly descriptive of certain kinds of "income." Compare Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339. 344; Hel'cring v.
Stockholrns Enlskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84, S6. We cannot say that Congress (lid not intend to include in its
definition a case like the present merely because the
taxpayer received a credit rather than money or other
tangible property. Compare Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.
v. United States, 296 U. S. 60, 62, 64. A receipt of interest is taxable as income whether paid in cash or by a
credit. Compare Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner,
279 U. S. 716; United States v. Boston & Maine R. R., id.,
732. This credit, it is true, was not entered on the taxpayer's books as interest or as an asset. But book-keeping entries, though in some circumstances of evidential
value, are not determinative of tax liability. Compare
Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179, 187. The
intent to use the full extent of power being clearly evident, we must not confine the legislation within narrower
forms than the statutory language would indicate. Compare Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U. S. 161, 166; Helvering v.
Stockholms Enskilda Bank, supra, 89.
Second. The company argues that uncontradicted evidence shows the fair market value of the mortgaged properties to have been less than the principal of the debts
and that therefore the interest paid was not income
within the meaning of the Act. A mortgagee who, at
foreclosure sale, acquires the property pursuant to a bid
of the principal and accrued interest is, as purchaser
and grantee, in a position no different from that of a

OCTOBER TERM; 1936.

stranger who acquires the property on a bid of like
amount. It is true that the latter would be obliged to
pay in cash the amount of his bid, while the formality
of payment in cash is ordinarily dispensed with when
the mortgagee acquires the property on his own bid.
But the rights acquired qua purchaser are the same in
either case; and, likewise, the legal effect upon the mortgage debt is the same. In each case the debt, including
the interest accrued, is paid. Where the stranger makes
the purchase, the debt is discharged by a payment in
cash; where the mortgagee purchases the property, the
debt is discharged by means of a credit. The amount so
credited to the mortgagor as interesit paid would be
available to him as a deduction in making his own income tax returns.' It would be strange if the sum deductible by the mortgagor debtor were not chargeable
to the mortgage creditor as income received. Where the
legal effect of a transaction fits the plain letter of the
statute, the tax is held payable, unless there is clearly
revealed in the Act itself or in its history a definite intention to exclude such transactions from the operation of
its applicable language. See Central National Bank v.
United States, 137 U. S. $55, 364; ' Treat v. White, 181
U. S. 264, 268; Provost v. United States, 269 U. S. 443,
456, 457, 458; Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284
U. S. 552, 560, 561. Respondent here makes no such
showing.
Third. The company argues that taxation is a practical
matter; that we should be governed by realities; that
the reality is, that all the company got was the property;
and that the property was worth less than the principal
of the debt. The "reality" of the deal here involved
'See Revenue Act of 1928, § 23 (b), 45 Stat. 791, 799.
' See also Kentucky Improvement Co. v. Slack, 100 U. S. 648, 658,
659; Bailey v. Railroad Co., 106 U. S. 109, 115, 116; compare Cary
v. Savings Union, 22 Wall. 38, 41.

HELVERING v. MIDLAND INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

would seem to be that respondent valued the protection
of the higher redemption price as worth the discharge of
the interest debt for which it might have obtained a
judgment. Moreover, the company's argument ignores
the needs of an efficient- system of taxation. The administration of the income tax law would be seriously burdened if it were held that when a mortgagee bids in the
property for a sum including unpaid interest, he may
not be taxed on the interest received except upon an inquiry into the probable fair market value of the property. 8 "At best, evidence of value is largely a matter of
opinion, especially as to real estate." Montana Railway
Co. v. Warren, 137 U. S. 348, 353. There is nothing
unfamiliar in taxing on the basis of the legal effect of a
transaction: Income may be realized upon a change in
the nature of legal rights held, though the particular
taxpayer has enjoyed no addition to his economic worth.
Compare Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339, 344, 346;
United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 170, 171; Marr v.
United States, 268 U. S. 536, 540; Burnet v. Commonwealth Improvement Co.,-287 U. S. 415, 419, 420. "The
income tax laws do not profess to embody perfect economic theory. They ignore some things that either a theorist or a business man would take into account in determining the pecuniary condition of the taxpayer." Weiss
v. Wiener, 279 U. S. 333, 335. Compare Nicol v. Ames,
173 U. S. 509, 516; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S.
497, 503V

'Compare Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232, 236;

U. S. 446, 449, 450; New York v. Latrobe, 279 U. S. 421, 427.
'Taxability has frequently been determined without reference to
factors which the accountant, economist or business man might deem
relevant to the computation of net gain. Compare Brushaber v.

Fourth. The company contends that to tax the mortgagee as upon interest received is inconsistent with the
rule declared in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, 594, that the mortgagee is entitled
to have "the mortgaged property devoted primarily to
the satisfaction of the debt, either through receipt of the
proceeds of a fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself." The charge of inconsistency is unfounded.
The company exercised its right to ha ,c a sale. At the
sale, it was free either to bid or to refrain from bidding.
If it bid, it was free to bid such sum as it pleased.. It
chose to bid the full amount of principal and interest.
Thus it obtained, in legal contemplation, full paymen
of the interest as well as the principal. To tax the company upon the full amount of interest received as a result of its own bid in no way impairs its rights as mortgagee. Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United
States, 286 U. S. 285, 289. If the bid had been insufficient
to yield full payment of the mortgage debt, principal
and interest, the company would have been entitled to
a judgment for the deficiency. If the company had refrained from bidding, and a stranger had bid more than
the principal, the company would obviously have been
taxable upon the excess up to the amount of the interest
due. Perhaps it was the company's custom of bidding
the full amount of principal and interest which deterred
bidding by others.

The judgment below, I think, is correct and should

on an annual basis may lead to the inclusion as income of items which
might be shown to involve no gain if the transactions were viewed

as a whole over several years. Compare Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks

Syllabus.

The notion that Congress intended to tax the mere
hope of recouping a loss sometime in the future should
be definitely rejected.
To support the assertion that here the company collected interest, when in fact everything received was
worth less than the sum loaned, requires resort to theory
at war with patent facts. The Company got nothing
out of which to pay the exactment; its assets were not
augmented. Like imaginary "receipts" of interest often
repeated and similarly burdened would hasten bankruptcy.
Divorced from reality taxation becomes sheer oppression.
