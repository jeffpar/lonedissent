GENERAL BAKING CO. v. IARR.
Opinion of the Court.

GENERAL BAKING CO. v. HARR, SECRETARY OF

BANKING OF PENNSYLVANIA,

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 559.

Argued March 5, 1037.-Decided March 29, 1937.

Diverse citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount being
present, a District Court has jurisdiction of a suit by a depositor
to fasten a trust on funds in an insolvent state bank, notwithstanding that the bank has been taken over by a state official for
liquidation pursuant to the state law. Commonwealth Trust Co.
v. Bradford, 297 U. S. 613. P. 434.
85 F. (2d) 932, 934, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 299 U. S. 539, to review a judgment which
reversed a judgment of the District Court and directed
dismissal of the suit for the want of jurisdiction. See
9 F. Supp. 210, 214.

Mr. Ggorge E. Beechwood, with whom Messrs. James
S. Benn, Jr., Mark E. Lefever, J. Harry LaBrum, and
William J. Conlen were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Joseph S. Clark, Jr., with whom Mr. Charles J.
Margiotti,Attorney General of Pennsylvania, was on the
brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Acting under Pennsylvania statutes, October 5, 1931,
William D. Gordon, Secretary of Banking, (respondent
Harr is his successor) closed the Franklin Trust Company,
a banking institution in Philadelphia, and took control
of its business and assets.
Thereafter in the United States District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, petitioner, a New York corpora130607 -37-28

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

tion, presented a bill against Gordon, setting up an
agreement by which it undertook to keep on deposit with
the Trust Company a sum specified, and the latter undertook either directly or through correspondent banks to
accept deposits of cash, checks, etc., and to forward the
proceeds therefrom to petitioner in New York. Also
that when closed the Trust Company had in its assets
$49,590.17 received under this agreement, and its correspondent banks had on hand deposits likewise acquired
amounting to $32,403.26.
The bill prayed for a decree declaring petitioner owner
of the $32,403.26 and that a trust existed in its favor in
respect of the $49,590.17 deposit; also for general relief.
The answer suggested some qualifications of the alleged
agreement and denied that there was no adequate remedy
at law. Otherwise, the allegations of the bill were generally admitted.
The District Court took jurisdiction of the controversy;
held petitioner was not owner of the $32,403.26; also
that no ground existed for impressing a trust upon assets
because of the $49,590.17 deposit; and dismissed the bill.
The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the District
Court had no jurisdiction and should have dismissed the
bill without adjudicating other questions. It accordingly
approved the dismissal but directed that the cause be
referred to the. state court for proper procedure there.
Although entered in September, 1936, the opinion below does not refer to Commonwealth Trust Co. v. Bradford, 297 U. S. 613, decided here March 30, 1936. Nothing indicates that this opinion was brought to the Court's
attention. The doctrine there approved, we think, is
decisive of the issue concerning jurisdiction now presented.
It was error for the Circuit Court of Appeals to hold
that the District Court was without jurisdiction of the
controversy. It should have passed on issues properly
presented upon the appeal.

remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further

Reversed.
STROEHMANN ET AL. V. MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 599.

Argued March 11, 1937.-Decided March 29, 1937.

Where, from the language of a policy of life insurance, it is doubtful whether provisions for disability benefits were excepted from
the "incontestable" clause, the doubt will be resolved in favor of
the insured. Pp. 439-440.
86 F. (2d)' 47, reversed.
District Court affirmed.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 646, to review a decree reversing a
decree dismissing the bill. The suit was by the insurance
company to cancel the disability benefits provisions of a
policy upon the ground of fraud, alleged to have been
practiced by the insured in obtaining the insurance. The
District Court at first refused to dismiss the bill, 6 F. Supp.
953, but later ruled the other way when the motion was
renewed after the bill had been amended.
Mr. George H. Hafer, with whom Messrs. George Ross
Hull and Carl B. Shelley were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Win. Marshall Bullitt, with whom Messrs. Frederick L. Allen and Reese H. Harris were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
By a policy dated June 30, 1930, respondent Insurance
Company, a New York corporation, agreed to pay the
