many tracks as should be used.
Again, it is urged that if the Omaha Company had built its
own road there would be no assertion of a right to deduct
from its mail pay, and that it is to run over the Great Norther, the latter not being made thereby lees useful or efficient,
is fok its purpose equivalent to building its own road. An
answer to this is contained in what we have said. We may
add, however, that the appellant no doubt considered the
advantages and disadvantages of the alternative presented
before making its selection, but it could not have supposed,
nor can we admit, that it could lessen rights in property because it could acquire like property for -itself.

ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 99. Argued Marsh 2, 3, 1910.-Derided April 4, 19106

This court accepts the construction of a state statute as to condemnstion of land given to it by the state court.
While in condemnation proeedings the mere mode of occupation does
not limit the right of an owner's recovery; the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a disregard of the mode of ownership, or require land to be valued as an qnencumbered whole when not so held.
Where one person owns the land condemned subject to servitudes to

others, the parties in interest are not entitled to have damages estimated as if the land were the sole property of one owner, nor are
they deprived of their property without due process of law within
the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment because each is awarded
the value of his respective interest in the property.
195 Massachusetts, 338, affirmed.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles A. Williams and Mr. Charles S. Hamlin for
plaintiff in error:

The market value of the "locus," the land taken for this
street at the time of the taking, was $60,00.
Consequently, the owners in fee simple of the land unencumbered were entitled to recover in this proceeding $0,000.
Boom Company v. Patterson, 98 U. S. 403.
In determining the damages sustained by an owner of land
taken by eminent domain, the use which the landowner at the
time of taking happens to be making of his land is not the
only thing to be considered., The use which the owner of the
land taken is making of the land at the time of the taking is
absolutely and wholly immaterial. Maynard v. Northampton,
157 Massachusetts, 218, 219; Eastern R. R. v. Boston & Maine
R.R., 111 Massachusetts, 125, 132; and see also Providence &c.
R. R. v. Worcester, 155 Massachusetts, 35; Conness v. Commonualth, 184 Massachusetts, 541; Fales v. Easthampton,
162 Massachusetts, 422, 425.
. The right of the petitioners to recover the fair market value
of the land is not lost because of the fact that there is more
than one owner, nor by reason of the fact that the entire title
is held by different owners who own different interests, nor
because of the fact that at the time of the taking the petitioners were making a use of the land similar- in kind to the
use which the city intended by its taking, to make of it.
And this although neither without the coSperation of the
other could convey a clear title to the whole estate. Edmands v. Boston, 108 Massachusetts, 535.'
The statute was not intended to be used so as to prevent

the recovery of full damages, i. e., the fair market of the
land taken. It was only intended to prevent the recovery of
more than the fair market value.
The taking of land for a highway and subjecting it to that
use in perpetuity, to the exclusion of all other uses, gives the
owner of the land taken, the right to recover the fair market
value of the'land taken, even though technically an easement
and'not the fee is taken. If what is taken is practically coextensive with the fee, and if the taking deprives the owner
of the beneficial interest in the land, then it makes no difference in the quantum of the damage whichl he has sustained
whether you call the taking a taking of an easement or a taking
of the fee. Lawrence v. Boston, 119 Massachusetts, 126; Ed'mands v. Boston, 108 Massachusetts, 535; Chan v. Worcester,
108 Massachusetts, 60, 67; Parka v. Boston, 15 Pick. 198;

Tel. Co. v. Noston Terminal Co., 182 Massachusetts, 397, 399;
Sears v. Crocker, 184 Massachusetts, 586.
The decision of the state court overlooks the vital fact that
the petitioners by their agreement with reference to this land
did not part with the right to sell the land to be used for any
of the purposes for which it was adapted, while the taking
by tlht city did deprive them 9f this right. Blaney v. Salem,
160 Massachusetts, 303.
In Massachusetts, easements in gross may be reserved in a
deed poll, and may be separately sold and conveyed. Goodrich v. -Burbank, 12 Allen, 459, 461; Whittenton Mfg. Co. v.

Massachusetts, 509; Burt v. Merchants' Ins. Co., 115 Massachusetts, 1; Bates v. Boston El. Ry., 187 Massachusetts, 328.
The construction of the statute by the state court gave the
plaintiffs in error just compensation measured by the loss
caused them. The decision entitled them to receive the value
of what they have been deprived. To have awarded more
would have been unjust to the public. At the time of the taking of the easement of public travel the land taken was already
subject to rights of way and to rights of light and air not only
to the Wharf and Dock Corporation but to its assigns, and the
owner of the land so taken may be limited in his recovery to
nominal damages. Bartlett v. Bangoi, 67 Maine, 460; Walker
v. Manchester, 58 N. H. 438; Wilkins v. Same, 74 N. H. 275;

error
The filing of a stipulation signed by the plaintiffs in.
could not make the property taken unencumbered building
land, and as such the property of a single owner in fee, when
at the time of the taking it was not. To so construe the statute
would have been to deprive the public of property without
due process of law rather than the plaintiffs in error. Thus the
United States will follow the construction of a state statute
given it by the highest court of the State. Maiorano v. B.

BOSTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE v. BOSTON. 193
217 U. S.
MR. JUSTICE

Opinion of the Court.

HoLis delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition for the assessment of damages caused by
the laying out of. a public street over 2955 square feet of land
at the apex of a triangle between India Street- and Central
Wharf Street in Boston, the latter being a private way between
Milk Street and Atlantic Avenue, laid out by the same order as
part of the same street. The Chamber of Commerce had a
building at the base of the triangle and owned the fee of the
land taken. The Central Wharf and Wet Dock Corporation,
which owned other land abutting on the new street, had an
easement of way, light and air over the land in question, and
the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank held a mortgage on the
same, subject to the easement. These three were the only
parties having any interests in the land. They filed an agreement in the case that the damages might be a
in a lump
sum, the city of Boston refusing to assent, and they contended that it was their right, as matter of law, under the
Massachusetts statute, R. L. c. 48, p. 495, §§ 20, 21, 22, and
the Fourteenth Amendment, to recover the full value of the
land taken, considered as an unrestricted fee. The city on the
other hand offered to show *thatthe restriction being of great
value'to the Central Wharf and Wet Dock Corporation, th
damage. to the market value of the estate of the Chamber of
Commerce was little or nothing, and contended that the damages must be assessed according to the condition of the title
at the *dateof the order laying out the street. It contended
that the jury could consider the improbability of the easement
being released as it might affect the mind of a possible purchaser of the servient estate, and that the dominant owner
could recover nothing, as it lost nothing by the superposition
of a public easement upon its own. The parties agreed that
if the petitioners were right, the damages should be assessed at
$60,060, without interest, but if the city was right they should
be $5,000. The judge before whom the case was tried ruled in
favor of the city, and this ruling was sustained by the Supreme
VOL. ocxvn-13

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

217 U. S.

Judicial Court, upon report. 195 Massachusetts, 338. A
judgment was entered in the court where the record remained,
and then the case was brought here.
We assume in favor of the petitioners, the plaintiffs in error,
that their only remedy was under the statute; and we give
them the benefit of the doubt in interpreting the decision of
the court, so far as to take it to mean that the statutes of
Massachusetts authorize the taking of land held as this was
with no other compensation than according to the principle
laid down. In short, we assume in their favor that the constitutional question is open, and that the case properly is not to
be dismissed. But we are of opinion that upon the only possible question before us here the decision was right.
Of course we accept the construction given to the Massachusetts statute by the state court. Maioranov. Baltimore & Ohio
R. R. Co., 213 U. S..268, 272.' The only question to be considered is whether when a man's land is taken he is entitled
by the Fourteenth Amendment to recover more. than the
value of it as it stood at the time. For it is to be observed that
the petitioners did not merely contend that they were entitled
to have the jury consider the chance of getting a release, for
whatever it might add to the market value of the land, as the
city merely contended that the jury should consider the chance
of not getting one. The petitioners contended that they had a
right, as matter of law under the Constitution, after the taking
was complete and all rights were fixed, to obtain the connivance or concurrence of the dominant owner, and by means of
that to enlarge a recovery that otherwise would be limited
to a relatively small sum. It might be perfectly clear that the
dominant owner never would have released short of a purchase
of the dominant estate-in other words, that the servitude
must have been maintained in the interest of land* not before
the court-but still, according to the contention, by a simple
joinder of parties after the taking, the~city could be made to
pay for a loss of theoretical creation, suffered by no one in fact.
The statement of the contention seems to us to be enough.

BOSTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE v. BOSTON. 195
217 U.S.

"Opinion of the Court.

It is true that the mere mode of. occupation does not necessarily limit the. right of an owner's recovery. Boom Co. v.
Patterson,98 U. S. 403,408. Louivlle & Nashville R. R. Co. v.
Barber Asphalt Co., 197 U. S. 430, 435. But the Constitution
does not require a disregard of the mode of ownership-of the
state of the title. It does not require a parcel of land to be
valued as an unencumbered whole when it is not held as an
unencumbered whole. It merely requires that an owner of
property taken should be paid for what is taken from him. It
deals with persons, not with tracts of land. And the question
is what has the owner lost, not what has the taker gained. We
regard it. as entirely plain that the petitioners were not entitled as matter of law to have the damages estimated as if the
land was the sole property of one owner, and therefore are
not entitled to $60,000 under their agreement. See Bartlett v.
Bangor, 67 Maine, 460, 468. Walker v. Manc4ester, 58 N. H.
438, 441. Gamble v. Philadelphia,162 Pa. St. 413. Matter of
Adams, 141 N. Y. 297. Olean v. Ste yner, 135 N. Y. 341,346.
Crowel v. Beuerly, 134 Massachusetts, 98. There is some subordinate criticism under the alternative agreement giving
them only $5,000: It is noticed that this was conditioned upon
the petitiners not being entitled as just stated, and upon the
admissibility of the evidence offered by the city, and upon the
substantial correctness of the requests for rulings; and it is
said that the evidence was not admissible. It seems to us that
the worst objection to it was that it was offered to prove the
obvious. But taking the agreement fairly we think it meant
only to contrast broadly the position of the two sides, and
made the result depend upon which was right.

Judgmnt affirmed.
