HOLMGREN v. UNITED -STATES.
CERTIORARI'TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH

CIRCUIT.
No. 132. Argued March 9, 1910.-Decided May16, 1910.
The validity, under.Art. I. §8, cl.4, of the Constitution, of the acts
of Congress regulating naturalization of aliens and.authorizing naturalization proceedings in state as well as Federal courts, has never.
been questioned.
Although Congress may not create courts for the States, it may authorize a state court to enforce in a prescribed nianner a Federal
statute relating t.oa matter within Federal control; and may punish
th6 offense of perjury if -committed in such a proceeding in a state
cour$, as well as in a Federal court.
One falsely swearingin -a naturalization- proceeding, whether in a state
or in a Federal court,'is punishable under § 5395, Rev. Stat.
The Revised Statutes were cdmpiled under authorlity.of the act of Congress of June 27, 1.866, c.140, 14 Stat" 75, the purpose of which Was
revision and codification%and not the creation of a new system of
'laws.; and the courts will not infer, in the absence of clearly expressed
*intent, that Congress in adopting the Revised Statutes intended to
change the policy of the laws, United tatea v. Rider, 110*U. S.729;
and so held that .§5395 and 5429, adopted from .the act of July 14,
1870, c..254, 16 Stat.254, in regard to naturalization, should be construed -so as to continue to include the penidties f~r perjury in all
naturalization *proceedings notwithstanding -that, owing to ..rearrangement, § 5395 -was not .one of the -five preceding sections to
§.5429, as was its corresponding section in the act 6f. 1870 to the
correspqnling section in that act from -which § 5429 was. taken.
An objection to the jury taking an indictment with indorsement of
prior conviction thereon into the jury-room should be taken at the
trial. If not taken until the motion for new trial, it cannot be reviewed on error.
Although this court may, under Rule 35, notice a plain error not assigned, it will' not exercise the'authority, if the error did not prejudice plaintiff in error; and' so held in this case in regard to the
objection that the jury had taken into the.jury-room an indictnient

with indorsement thereon of former cotivictign, it also having-the
indorsement thereon of the granting of a new trial.
An objection that a count in the indictment. does not charge a crime because the wrong name was written in at one point by mistake must
-be taken in the demurrer or on the trial; unless it substantially affected the rights of.the accused it comes too late-in this court for the
first time.
While the court should. caution the jury against relying on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it cannot assume as a fact, -when
controverted, that a witness was an accomplice. and that his testimony required corroboration.
158 Fed. Rep. 439, affirmed.

Ti4E facts, which involve the validity of a. conviction for
perjury 'under §.5395, Rev. Stat;, for false swearing in a naturalization proceeding in a state court, are stated in the opinion.

Sutherland on Stat. Const., § 154.
Congress evidently, ex industria,evolved a different scheme
and plan of denouncing offenses against: the naturalization
laws from that first contained in the act of July 14, .1870, in
view of the rule that perjury is properly punishable only by
the court of jurisdiction where committed. State v. Pike, 15

United States v. Severino, 125 Fed. Rep. 949.
There was no Federal statute .when -the petitioner. was
charged and convicted in the Federal court, which, in plain
terms, conferred jurisdiction upon the Federal courts to punish perjuries and false oatihs committed in naturalization proceedings in state courts. If there was such aFederal statute,.
it would be unconstitutional ar.d void.
Congress cannot endow state courts with any jurisdictiQn.
The California courts get jurisdiction to naturalize aliens from*
the constitution and laws'of the State. Ex partt Knowles, 5:

land v. Butler, reported in 12 Niles' Register, 115;. United
States v. Lathrop, 17 Johnson's Ch. Rep. 4; State v. McBride,
Rice's .Ch.-Rep. 400.
While Congress cannot corner on state courts jurisdiction
to naturalize, it can, in naturalization proceedings, limit the
state court in. its mode of. proceeding, and can prohibit. the.
state courts from acting, and it actually.has done so as to any
state court. which is not. a "Court of .Record", and does not
have. "common law jurisdiction, and a Seal and Clerk." Ex

laws, even though an act of Congress undertakes to give them
the authority. Neither can perjury against the United States
be punished in the States as an offense against the States.
2 Bishop's Comm. Crim. Law, § 866.
Federal tribunals cannot punish breaches of the state laws
in Federal courts, such as perjury committed in the state
courts. This is well-settled law, and the converse is equally
true. See People v. Kelly, 38 California, 145.
It was misconduct on the part of the court to give to the
jury indictments, containing information of the adverse result
of a previous trial, and it would be presumed that prejudice
had been generated by such misconduct. Ogden v. United
States, 112 Fed. Rep. 523, citing Daha v. Tucker, 4 Johns. 487;

The trial court not only declined to instruct as requested

Although an accomplice is a competent witness for the
prosecution, his testimony should be received with great care
and caution and a refusal to so instruct is grourd for reversal.

where it has been settled. by plain language in the statutes,
unless it is clear that such was the intent. McDonald v. Hovey,

''MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered'the opinion of the court.

The petitioner, Gustav Holmgr^b; was convicted and sentenced in the District Court of the United States for the
Northern District of California of the crime of false swearing
in naturalization prpce'edings, in' violation of § 5395' of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
.Opinion of the Court.,

217 U. S.

Revised Statutes of the United States. The judgment was
affirmed. by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 156 Fed.. Rep. 439.
The conviction was upon the third count of tne indictment,
Which charged that in a naturalization proceeding, upon the
application of one Frank Werta for admission :to citizenship
in. the United States, pending September 21, .1903, in the
Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco, California, &court of record of the State. of California, with comr
mon law jurisdiction, a seal, and a clerk, the petitioner swore
falsely in making the material statement, under oath, that
he, the said Gustav.-Holmgren, had been acquainted with the
said Frank Werta in the United States during the five years
immediately preceding the application for naturalization.,
whereas in truth and in fact,. as he thefi well.knew, the said
Werta had not resided continuously in the United States for
.a period (if five years, and the said Holmgren had not known
the said Werta 'for more than, four -years prior to said application.
The principal question in the case is whether, under § 5395,
United States Revised Statutes, -a conviction can be had in a
Federal court for a false oath in naturalization. proceedings
had in a state. court.
Preli miinarily to aconsideration of the proper construction
of this section we may notice the.contention of the petitioner
.that there is no *constitutional power in Congress to confer
jurisdiction upon the courts of a State in naturalization pro-.
ceedings, involving admission to citizenship'in the United

States..
Article I, § 8, clause 4, of the Constitution of the United
States vests in Congress the power to establish an uniform rule.
of naturalization. Acting under this constitutional authority
from the earliest history of. the Government, Congress has.
passed acts regulating the naturalization of aliens, admitting
them to citizenship in the United States, and has authorized
proceedings in the state, as well as Federal, courts. The
,.suchvalidity of such proceedings by virtue of the power coiiferred

by acts of CongTess has been recognized from an early day.
Campbell v. Gordon, 6 Cranch, 176, 182; ,Stark v. Chesapeake
Ins. Co., 7 Cranch,.420. The naturalization acts of the United
States from the first one in 1790 have conferred authority

Van Dyne on
upon state courts to admit aliens to citizenship..
. '

Naturalization, p. 11, and the following.
It is .undoubtedly true that the right to create courts for
the States does not exist in Congress. The Constitution provides (Art. III, § 1) that the judicial power f the United States
shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior
courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. But-it does not follow that Congress may not constitutionally authorize the magistrates or courts of a State
to enforce a statute. providing for a uniform system of naturalization, and defining certain proceedings which, when complied with, shall make the applicant a citizen of the United
States.. This Congress had undertaken to .do inmaking provision for the naturalization of aliens to become citizens of the
United States in a certain class of state courts--those of
record having common law jurisdiction, a clerk and a seal.
Rev. Stat. U. S., §2165 (since superseded by the act of
June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596).
The: question is .not here presented -whetherthe States- can
be required to enforce. such naturalization laws against their
consent for it appears that the constitution of the State of
California, in § 5, article 6, and the statutes in §-76 of the
Code of Civil -Procedure of that State, grant to the courts the
power of naturalization and the right to issue papers therefor.
Unless prohibited by state legislation, state courts and magistrates may exercise the powers conferred by. Congress under
such laws.. Stephens, Petitioner, 4 Gray, 559. The indictment charges that Werta made application as an alie4 to be
admiitted to citizenship in the United States; the proceeding
was had. and'false oath charged, was taken under authority
of:the statutes of*the United States.. The present proceeding
was to prosecute the petitioner for alleged false swearing un-

217 U. S.

der an oath administered under aithority of a law of the
United States. Where such is the case we think the Congress
of the United States may constitutionally provide for the punishment of such offenses, Whether the oath is taken before a
Federal court or officer, or before a state court or officer acting under authority derived from the act of Congress. See
In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372, 374.
We come, then, to the question whether the section under
which the proceeding was had authorizes a prosecution for
perjury when committed in naturalization proceedings in
other than Federal courts. As we have seen,. the statutes of
the United States confer jurisdiction to admit aliens to citizenship in the United States, not only on Federal courts, but
also upon certain state courts, and §5395 of the Revised
Statutes provides:
,Inall cases where any oath or affidavit is made or taken
under or by virtue of any law relating to the naturalization
of aliens, or in any proceedings under such laws, any person
taking or making such oath or affidavit, who knowingly swears
falsely, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than
-five years nor less than one year, and by a fixe of not more
than one thousand dollars."
The terms of this section are certainly broad enough to ineclude -an oath or affidavit, whether taken in a Federal court
or a state court, for the requirement of the statute is that such
oath or affidavit be made or 'taken under or by virtue of any
law relating to naturalization of aliens or i.n any proceedings
under any-such laws. The false oath in question was taken
under and by virtue of the Federal statutes regulating naturalization,, and in a proceeding. authorized under such laws,
although in a state court.
It is contended, however, that the history of this section
(5395) and the effect of the revision of the laws.embodied in
the Revised Statutes. of 1873 makes it applicable only to false
swearing in the. courts of the United States in such naturalizatiqn proceedings as may .be therein instituted. As .car-

HOLMGREN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

tied into the Revised Statutes, this section was taken from
§ 1 of the act of July 14, 1870, being an act to amend the
naturalization laws and to punish crimes against the same,
etc. July 14, 1870, c. 254, 16 Stat. 254. Section 4 of that act

was as follows:

"And be it further enacted, That the provisions of this
act shall apply to all proceedings had or taken or attempted
to be had or taken before any court in which any proceeding
for naturalization shal be commenced, had, or taken, or attempted to be.commenced; and the courts of the United States

shall have jurisdiction of all offenses under the provisions of
this act, in'or before whatsoever court or tribunal the same
shall have been committed."
In codifying the sta.tutes,. the first section of the act of
July 14, 1870, was made § 5395 of the Revised Statutes, and
is part of Title LXX, chapter 4, "Crimes against Justice."
Sections 2 and 3 of the act were made §§ 5424 to 5428 of the
Revised Statutes, and part of chapter 5, entitled "Crimes
against-the Operations of the. Government." Section 4 of the
act of July 14, 1870, was made § 5429 of the Revised Statutes,
and reads as follows:

"The provisions of the five preceding sections shall apply
to all proceedings had or taken, or attempted to be had or
takenlbefore any court in which any proceeding for naturalization may be commenced or attempted to be commenced."
The argument is that, inasmuch as §5395 is not one of the
"five preceding sections," it is to be inferred that. Congress
intended to give jurisdiction to the Federal courts for violation of that section only in naturalization proceedings in the
Federal courts, and not to include false swearing in naturalization proceedings before any court, which would include a
state court. But we cannot agree to this contention. The
Revised Statutes are the result of the revision and codification of the laws under authority of an act of Congress, whose
purpose it was, not to cteate a new system of laws, but to
codify and arrange former laws, omitting redundant or ob-

sol ete enactments, and making such amendments and changes
as were necessary to correct contradictions, supply omissions
and amend imperfections in the original text. June 27, 1866,
c. 141, 14 Stat. 75.
The courts will not infer that Congress in revising and consolidating the laws intended to change their policy in the absence of a clear expression of such purpose. United States v.
Ryder, 110 U. S. 729, 740. No reason is suggested for a change
9f the purposes of the law in the separation of the sections
according to the codification in the manner we have stated.
The purpose of the laws was still the same, and when we interpret this section of the statutes, in view of its origin, we
think there can be no doubt of its meaning. The act of
July 14, 1870, made its provision applicable to all proceedings
had before any court in which naturalization proceedings
might be commenced, and gave to the courts of the URited
States jurisdiction of all Such offenses committed before any
tribunal, state or Federal. The language of § 5395 is broad
enough to include proceedings in any court, and, considered
in the light of its adoption from laws of the same purport, we
have no doubt of the intention of Congress to continue to includeall such proceedings.
It is next contended that the court erred in permitting the
indictment to go to the jury, and be taken with them into
the jury-room, which, indictment contained an indorsement
thereon showing the conviction of the accused on the third
count thereof at a former trial. The proceedings in this respect are thus set out in the record:
"Thereupon and before the jury retired to deliberate upon
their verdict the clerk of the court handed to the jury the
forms of ballot with.the indictment in the case. That said
indictment was taken by them to the jury room and retained
by them, during their entire deliberations in the cause. That
the jury retired at 1 2 .30 o'clock and later returned to the
court with a verdict of guilty on the third count of said indictment. -That at the time sAid indictment was handed to

It would be sufficient to say of this objection that it was not
taken until a motion was made for a new trial, which motion,
with the accompanying affidavits to the effect that the jury
had read and considered the indorsements upon the indictment, was considered and the motion overruled by the trial.
court. It has been frequently, decided that the allowance or
refusal of a new trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial
court and its action in that respect cannot be made the basis
of review by writ of error to this court. Indianapolis &c. R.
R. Co. v. Horst, 93 U. S. 291, 301; Kerr v. Clampitt, 95 U. S.
188; Newcomb v. Wood, 97 U. S. 581, 583.
It is contended by the petitioner that a contrary view to that
taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case was taken
in Ogden v. United States, 112 Fed. Rep. 523, Circuit Court of
Appeals of the Third Circuit. In that case, however, it appeared that the court below refused to consider the motion
and affidavit, showing that the indictment, with an indorsement of a former conviction thereon, had been taken to and
kept in the jury-room during their deliberations. The court
recognized the rule that the overruling'of a motion for a new
trial is not a subject of review in an appellate court, but
found that the court below had refused to consider the mtion and affidavits, and declined to exercise its discretion, as
it was its duty to do. It is true the court, after finding that
reversible error had been committed by the failure to entertain the motion for a new trial, deemed it was its duty not
merely to remand so that the motion might be considered by
the court below, but itself passed upon the motion for a new

trial. The primary basis, however, upon which the. court
acted was the failure of the court below to consider the motion for a new trial, a circumstance which does not exist here.
To the like effect is Mattox v. United Staes, 146 U. S. 140,
where- the court below refused to entertain affidavits showing
the reading of a newspaper, containing an unfavorable axticle, during the deliberations of the jury, and also damaging'
remarks of an officer in charge of the jury during the progress
of the trial. In both cases the basis of the action of the reviewing court was the refusal of the courts below to exercise
the discretion vested in them by- law.
But, it is urged, that notwithstanding the objection was
first taken in this case upon the motion for a new trial, this
court may notice a plain error not properly reserved in the
record. Undoubtedly the court has this authority and does
sometimes exercise it.
But an examination of the record in this case does not
*satisfy us that we should exercise this right to review an error
not properly reserved, and require the granting of a new trial,
because of the indorsements upon the indictment sent to the
jury, together with the forms of verdict. The record contains
all the testimony, and is ample to sustain the conviction of the
defendant without giving weight to the effect of this indorsement. The indorsement itself shows that a new trial was
granted upon the former conviction on the third count. This
action of the court in setting aside what the jury had formerly
done is quite as likely to influence the jury favorably to the
accused, as was the fact of former conviction by the jury to
work to his prejudice.
We do not mean to indicate that such indorsements should
be permitted to go to a jury, or that the fact of former conviction should be urged or referred to in the progress of the
trial. It is undoubtedly the correct rule that the jury should
be kept free from all such extraneous and improper influences. But, in this case we do not !find in the record any
reason for the exercise of the authority granted to us under

Opinion of the Court.

the thirty-fifth rule to notice a plain error not properly reserved.
It is further urged that the indictment in the third count
thereof does not properly charge an offense against Holmgren.
It is true that in the third count it appears that the name of
Frank Werta, the alien, was written by mistake for that of
Gustav Holmgren, in averring that the witness was duly and
properly sworn, but this count also contains the averment
that "the said Gustav Holmgren having taken such oath to
testify, as aforesaid, did then and there willfully," etc., and
"contrary to the said oath testify in substance and to the
effect," etc. This objection does not appear to have been specifically pointed out in the demurrer or otherwise taken advantage of upon the trial. In this proceeding it is too late to
urge such objections to a matter.of form unless it is apparent
that it affected the substantial rights of the accused. Re=
vised Stat., § 1025; Conners v. United States, 158 U. S. 408,
411;. Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U. S. 56, 84.
It is further alleged that the court erred in refusing to give
the following request to charge concerning the testimony of
Frank Werta, the alien seeking to be naturalized in the proceeding:
"I charge you that if you believe the testimony of the witness Frank -Werta, then that said witness was an accomplice
in crime with the defendant; and I instruct you that before
you can convict said defendant the testimony of the witness,
Frank Werta' should be corroborated by the testimony of at
least one witness or strong corroborative circumstances."
It may be doubtful whether Werta can be regarded as an
accomplice, as the record tends to show that he had no part
in procuring the testimony of Holmgren, and in nowise induced .him to make the oath which was the basis for the proceedings. Be that as it may, the request did not properly
state the law, as it assumed that Werta was an accomplice, a
conclusion which was controverted, and* against which the
jury might have found in the light of the tiestimony. It is

undoubtedly. the better practice for courts to caution juries
against too much reliance upon the testimony of accomplices,
and to require corroborating testimony before giving credence
to them. But no such charge was asked to be presented to
the jury by any proper request in the case, and the refusal to
grant the one asked for was not error.
Other questions are raised in the case as to the admissibility of certain testimony; we have examined them and find
nothing prejudicial to the rights of the petitioner.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is, therefore,

affirmed.

Argued April 6, 7, 1910:.-Decided May 16, 1910.

The right to regulate interstate commerce is exclusively vested in
Congress, and the States cannot pass any law directly regulating
such commerce; but the States may, in the. exercise of the police
power, pass laws in the interest of public safety which do not interfere directly with the operations of interstate commerce.
The constitutionality of a state statute regulating operation of railroad trains depends upon its effect on interstate commerce; and, in
the absence of congressional regulation on the subject, States may
make reasonable regulations as to the manner in which trains shall
approach, and give notice of their approach'to, dangerous crossing,.
so long as they are not a direct burden upon interstate commerce.
