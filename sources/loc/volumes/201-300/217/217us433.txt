ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.

No. 493. Submitted January 10, 1910.-tDecided May 2, 1910.

This court accepts the construction of the st4te court; and wherq that
court has held that an agreement between retailers not to purcbse
from wholesale dealers who sell direct to consumers within prescribed localities amounts to a restraint of trade within .the meaning
of the anti-trust statute of the State, the only question for this court
is whether such statute so unreasonably abridges freedom of conVOL. ccxvii--28

tract as to amount to deprivation of property without due process
of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.
An act harmless when done by one may become a public wrong when
done by many acting in concert, and when it becomes the object of
a conspiracy and operates in restraint of trade the police power of
the State may prohibit it without impairing the liberty of contract
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment; and so held that while
an individual may not be interfered with in regard to a fixed trade
rule not to purchase from competitors, a State may prohibit more
than one from entering into an agreement not to purchase from certain described persons even though such persons be competitors and
the agreement be made to enable the parties thereto to continue
their business as independents.
Whether a combination is or is not illegal at common law is immaterial
if it is illegal under a state statute which'does not infringe the'Fourteenth Amendment.
A combination that is actually in restraint of trade under a statute
which is constitutional, is illegal whatever may be the motive or necessity inducing it.
In determining the validity of a state statute, this court is eoncerned
only with its constitutionality; it does not consider any question of
its expediency.
In determining the constitutionality of a state statute this court considers only so much thereof as is assailed, construed and applied in
the particular case.
One not within a class affected by a statute cannot attack its constitutionality.
Where the penalty provisions of a statute are clearly separable, as in
this case, and are not invoked, this court is not called upon to determine whether the penalties are so excessive as to amount to deprivation of property without due process of law and thus render the
statute unconstitutional in that respect.
In this case, in an action by the State in equity and not to enforce
penalties, held that the anti-trust statute of Mississippi, ยง 5002,
Code, is not inconstitutional as abridging the liberty of contract
as against retail lumber dealers uniting in an agreement, which the
state court decided was within the prohibition of the statute, not
to purchase any hiateriai6 from wholesale dealerm selling direct to
consumers in certain localities.

The proceeding under this statute was by a bill filed in a
chancery court of the State, by the State, upon relation of
its Attorney General. The bill averred that the defendants,
some seventy-seven individuals and corporations, were retail
dealers in lumber, sash, doors, etc., doing business, some of
them, in the State of Mississippi and others in the State of
Louisiana, and were competitors in business, each engaged in
buying and selling again for profit, and in competition, with
each other for the bqsiness of consumers; that the defendants

press all competition between themselves, as retail dealers in
the materials mentioned, and manufacturers, wholesale aealers,
brokers or commission men, keeping no stock, from. selling
the like articles or commodities directly to consumers in competition with retailers. To accomplish this suppression of
competition for the trade of consumers it was in substance
averred that they had organized an association and had ob.ligated themselves not to purchase any of their stock or commodities from any wholesale dealer or manufacturer who sold
.such products direct to the consumers in competition with
the members of their combination and to carry out this end
had adopted articles of agreement, called a constitution, and
appointed.a secretary to ascertain such sales and to see that
the obligation of the members was- respected. The material
parts of the agreement under which the defendants combined
consist of a preamble, called "Declaration of Purpose," the
relevant part of which, together with articles 2, 3 and 7, are
set out in the margin.'
It was then averred that the necessary effect .of such agreement among the defendants. who, it was said, composed a
majority of all the retail lumber dealers in the States covered
by their compact, was to limit or destroy competition between
IDeclation of Purpose.
We recognie, the right of the manufacturer and wholesale dealer
in lumber products to-sell lumber in whatever market, to whatever
purchaser, and at whatever price, they may see fit.
We also recognise the disastrous consequences which result to the
retail dealer from direct competition with wholesalers and maniifacturers, and appreciate the importance to the retail dealer of accurate information as to the nature and extent of such competition,
where any exists.
And, recognizing that, we, as retail dealers in lumber, sash, doors
and blinds, cannot meet competition from those from whom we buy,
we are pledged as members of this association to buy only from manufacturers and wholesalers.who do not sell direct to consumers, where
there are retail lumber dealers who carry.stock commensurate with
the demands of their communities, and we are pledged not to buy
from lumber commission merchants, agents and brokers, who sell to

could follow, or that the agreement had any other object
than to "conserve and advance their business interests as
retailers." That their agreement is defensive of and not
injurious to public interests is asserted by many paragraphs
of the-answer upon economic considerations.
The chancery court, upon the pleadings and exhibits, held
that the association and agreement among the members was
'a combination in restraint of trade and intended to hinder
competition in the sale and purchase of a commodity, and
was inimical to the public welfare, and unlawful." The dissolution of the association was adjudged and an injunction
against further operations granted. This decree was affirmed
upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the State.

Mr. J. B. A'uraing for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE LURTON, after making the above statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The agreement and combination which offends against
the Mississippi anti-trust statute is one between a large
majority of the independent and competitive merchants engaged in the retail lumber trade in the territory covered by
their articles of association, whereby they have obligated
themselves not to deal with any manufacturer or wholesale
dealer in lumber, sash or doors, etc., who sells to consumers
in localities in which they conduct their business and keep
a sufficient stock to meet demands, and to inform each other
of any sale made by manufacturers or wholesalers who sell
to consumers..
That such an agreement and combination was, within the
meaning of the Mississippi statute, a conspiracy "in restraint
of trade," "intended to hinder competition in the Droduction,

importation,. manufacture, transportation, sale or purchase
of a commodity," is the express decision of the Supreme
Court of Mississippi. That the object and purpose. of the
compact was to suppress competition between the plaintiffs
in error and another class of dealers in or producers of the
same commodity and the consumer is avowed in the "Declaration of Purpose," set out heretofore, in which it is stated
that the members of the association; as retailers, "cannot
meet competition from those from whom they buy." ' This
concession. means, if it means anything, that those against
whom the plaintiffs in error are acting in concert will undersell them in the competition for the trade of the consuming
public, and must therefore be stopped by concerted refusal
to deal with. them if they should persist in such competition.
This constitutes under the interpretation of the Mississippi
statute by the Mississippi court a "restraint of trade," and a
hindrance to competitors in the sale of a commodity. Accepting, as we must, this interpretation and application of a
state statute by the highest court. of the State, tiere is no
question for our consideration other than the insistence. that
the statute is in conflict With the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States. The contention is
that this statute abridges unreasonably the freedom of contract
which is as much within the protection of that Amendment
as is liberty of person.
That any one of the persons engaged in the retail lumber
business might have made a fixed rule of conduct not to buy
his stock from a producer or wb.olesaler who should sell to
consumers in competition with himself, is plain. No law
which would infringe his freedom of contract in that particular would stand. But when the plaintiffs in error combine and agree that no one of them will trade with any producer or wholesaler who shall sell to a consumer within'the
trade range of any of them, quite another case is presented.

punished, if the result be :hurtful to the*public or to the individual against whom the concerted action i4 direted
Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 555, 556.
But the plaintiffs in error say that the action which they
have taken is purely defensive, and that they cannot maintain themselves as independent dealers supplying the consumer if the producers or wholesalers from whom they buy
may not be prevented from competing with them for the
direct trade of the consumer.
For the purpose of suppressing this competition they have
not stopped with an individual obligation to refrain from
dealing with one who sells within his own circle, and thereby
deprives him of a possible customer, but have agreed not to
deal with any one who makes sales to consumers, which sales
might have been made by any one of the seventy-seven independent members of the association. Thus they have
stripped themselves of all freedom of contract in order to
compel those against whom they have combined to elect
between their combined trade and that of consumers. That
such an agreement is one in restraint of trade is undeniable,
whatever the motive or necessity which has induced the
compact. Whether it would be an illegal restraint at common
law is not now for our determination. It is an illegal combination and conspiracy. under the Mississippi statute. That
is enough if the statute does not infringe the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The argument that the situation is one which justified the
defensive measures taken by the plaintiffs in error is'
one
which we need neither refute nor concede. Neither are we
required to consider any mere question of the expediency of
such a law. It is a regulation of commerce purely intrastate,
a subject as entirely under the control of the State as is the
delegated control over interstate commerce exercised by the
United States. The power exercised is the police power reserved to the States. The limitation upon its exercise con-

tained in the Federal Constitution is found in the Fourteenth
Amendment,- whereby no State may pass any law by which
a citizen is deprived of life, liberty or property without due
process of law. A like limitation upon the legislative power
will be found in the constitution of each State. That legislation might be so arbitrary or so irrational in depriving a
citizen of freedom of contract as to come under the condemnation of the Amendment may be conceded.
In dealing with certain Kansas legislation in regulation of
state commerce, which was claimed to be so extreme as to be
an unwarranted infringement of liberty of contract, this court,
in Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. 447, 457, said:
"Undoubtedly there is a certain freedom of contract which
cannot be destroyed by legislative enactment. In pursuance
of that freedom parties may seek to further their business
interests, and it may not be always easy to draw the line between those contracts which are beyond the reach of the
police power and those which are subject to prohibition or
restraint. But a secret arrangement, by which, under penalties, an apparently existing competition among all the
dealers in a community in one of the necessaries of life is
substantially destroyed, without any merging of interests
through partnership or incorporation, is one to which the
police power extends. This is as far as we need go in sustaining the judgment in this case."
We confine ourselves to so much of the act assailed as was
construed and applied in the present, case. If there should
arise a case in which this legislation is sought to be applied
where any interference with freedom of contract would be
beyond legislative restraint, it will be time enough for interference by the courts.
As observed in Smiley v. Kansas, where the breadth ot the
act was criticised, "Unless appellant can show that he himself has been wrongfully included in the terms of the law, he
can have no just ground of cbmplaint." The ยงame principle
has been often announced by this court in many cases, the
