UNITED STATES v. WELCH.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.
No. 147.

Argued April 11, 1910.-Decided April 25, 1910.

A private right of way is an easement and is land, and its destruction
for public purposes is a taking for whidh the owner of the dominant
estate to which it is attached is entitled to compensation.
The value of an easement cannot be ascertained without reference to
the dominant estate to which it is attached. In this case an award
for destruction of a right of way and also for damages to the property to which it was an easement sustained.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John Q. Thompson, Assistant Attorney General, with.

whom Mr. A. C. Campbell and Mr. Percy M. Cox were on the
brief, for the United States:
The six assignments of error all refer to the rulings of the
court in respect to the private road, and but one question,
Did the court err in awarding damages to plaintiffs' land by
reason of the destruction of said private road?
It may be admitted that where the Government by the

erection of a public improvement takes private property there
is an implied contract on its part to make compensation
therefor.
But if private property is merely lessened in value by the
erection of a public improvement and is not invaded or encroached upon, there is no such implied contract. Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642; United States v.
Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 465; Mills v. United Stoles, 46 Fed. Rep.

is made, it must be shown that the owner thereof has been
wholly deprived of the use of the same. If it has been merely
injured or its use impaired, there is no taking such as is contemplated by said Amendment. TransportationCo. v. Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642; Bedford v. United States, 192 U. S. 217,

C., B. & Q. Ry. v. Drainage Commissioners, 200 U. S. 561,

583, 584.
Where ingress and egress to and from private property is
rendered more difficult by reason of the erection of a public
improvement and the value of the property is thereby lessened, there is not a taking such as is contemplated by said
Amendment. Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S. 269, 270, 275.
A claim for damages against the Government which arises
out of the construction of a lock and dam to improve the navigable capacity of a river, whereby a private road has been destroyed which afforded to the owners of the farm convenient
access to and from a public highway, is not a claim" founded
upon the Constitution,'" even though the destruction of the
private road has lessened the value of the farm. Scranton
v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 164.
No action will lie for damages consequent, upon the erection of public improvements in a skillful and prudent manner,
although the result of such erection may impair the value of
property by rendering ingress and egress thereto more difficult. It is axiomatic that private rights are always subservient to the public good. Groti -is de Jure Belli, Bk. 3,

In Bauman v. Ross, 167 U. 'S. 548, it is held that Congress
may direct that when a part of a parcel of land is appropriated
for public use the tribunal vested by law with the duty of
assesing the compensation or damages due to the owner
shall take into consideration the injury to the rest. But
Congress has made no provision for the payment of sucrt
damages as are claimed in the case at bar.

Mr. Edward S. Jouett, with whom Mr. W. M. Bekner was
on the brief, for defendants in error:
The private right of way which one landholder owns over
the land of his neighbor is an easement. In fact, of all easements it is one of the commonest and best known, particularly in the agricultural districts. And it is oftentimes, as in
this case, a property interest of great value. 14 Cyc. 1139.
An easement is as subject to condemnation under the right
of eminent domain as any other interest in lands is. See Eminent Domain, in 15 Cyc. 607; Ross v. Georgia &c. Rwy. Co.,
33 S. Car. 477; Deavitt v. Washington, 53 Atl. Rep. 563.
Railroad rights of way, which are in a sense private property, furnish many instances of the application of the rule.
West. Un. Tel. Co. v. Penn. R. R. Co., 195 U. S 540.
A fee simple interest is taken in the southern end of the
roadway because it id a part of the farm itself.
As to the propriety of considering the impairment of the
value of the remainder of a tract by reason of its relation to
the part taken, see High Bridge Lumber Company v. United
States, 69 Fed. Rep. 320.
Permanent overflowing is a "Taking" within the meaning
of the constitutional prrvision. Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co.,

been cited and approved more than fifty times. The authorities relied upon by the counsel for the Government do not
sustain its position.
The. damages are not merely -onsequential in the legal
meaning of that term. Wherever there is an actual physical
invasion compensation is due, and the law then fixes the
measure of that compensation to be the value of the part
taken plus the damage to the remainder of the property resulting from such taking. Cooley on Const. Lim..; Sedgwick
on Stat. Conast.; Louisville & Frankfort R. R. v.. Brown, 17
B. Mon. 763; Hollister v. The Union Co., 9 Connecticut, 436;
Currie v. Waverly &c. Railroad Co., 23 Vroom, 392, can all
be distinguished and really support contention of defendant in
error.
Treating the farm and its easement separately would not
avail the Government, as the value of the easement, which
was taken and entirely extinguished, would still have to be
allowed.
Damages to the residue of a tract caused by taking a part
are allowable in fixing just compensation. = arp v. United
States, 191 U. S. 341; 8; C., 112 Fed. Rep. 693. The doctrine
of "inconvenience" only applies where there is no actual
taking and it cannot be substituted for a taking; but when
there is a taking of a part, then "inconvenience" to the residue
becomes one of the legitimate elements of damage to the
resdue. The Welch farm and its private Ladway should
b. considered as one property. Sharp v. United States, supra.
TL converse of that case is presented in the case at bar.
See note in 57 L. R. A. 932, citing Westbrook v. Muscatine
Co. 88 N. W. Rep. 202; Potts v. Penn. S. Valley R. Co., 119
Pa. St. 278; Peck v. Superior Short Line R. Co., 36 Minnesota,
343.
The same. amount would necessarily be: allowed even if
the farm and the easement were not considered as one piece
of property.

roadway, was totally destroyed, rendering compensation equal
to its value necessary. Ifthe easement had not been touched
the outlet was still destroyed by the submerging of fifty yards
of roadway. United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., 112 U. S.
545; Hill v. United States, 149 U. S. 593; and Bigby v. United
States, 188 U. S. 400, distinguished; and see United States v.
Lynah, 188 U. S. 446.
MR. JuSTICE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

Thii is a. proceeding under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359,

ยง 2, 24 Stat. 505, to recover the value of land taken by the
United States. It is admitted that a strip of about three acres
of land lying along the side of Four Mile Creek and running
east and west was taken, and is to be paid for. It was permanently flooded by a dam on the Kentucky River, into which
Four Mile Creek flows. United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445.
Manigault v. Springs, 199 U. S. 473, 484. The plaintiffs
owned other land south of and adjoining the strip taken, and
had aprivate right of way at right angles to the creek northerly
across land of other parties to the Ford County Road, which
ran parallel to the creek and at some distance from it. This
was the only practical outlet from the plaintiffs' farm to the
county road. The taking of the intervening strip of course cut
off the use of the way, and the judge who tried the case found
that it lessened the value of the farm $1,700. He allowed this
sum in addition to $300 for the land taken. The United States
took a writ of error on the ground that the former item was
merely for collateral damage not amounting to a taking and of
a kind that cannot be allowed; that at most it was ofily a tort.
The case is likened to the depreciation in value of a neighboring
but distinct tract by reason of the use to which the Government intends to put that which it takes. Sharp v. United
States, 191 U. S.341, 355.
The petition like the form of the finding lends some countenance to this contention, by laying emphasis on the damage

Opinion of the Court.

to the farm, although it is to be noted that even in this aspect
the damage is to the tract of which a part is taken. Sharp v.
United States, 191 U. S. 354. But both petition and finding in
substance show clearly that the way has been permanently
cut off. A private right of way is an easement and is land.
We perceive no reason why it should not be held to be acquired by the United States as incident to the fee for which it
admits that it must pay. But if it were only destroyed and
ended, a destruction for public purposes may as well be a taking as would be an appropriation for the same end. Miller v.
Horton, 152 Mass. 540, 547. The same reasoning that allows
a recovery for the taking of land by permanent occupation
allows it for a right of way taken in the same manner, and the
value of the easement cannot be ascertained without reference
to the dominant estate to which it was attached. The argument is only confused by reference to cases like Gibson v.
United States, 166 U. S. 269, Harvard College v. Stearns, 15
Gray, 1, Smith v. Boston, 7 Cush. 354, &c., where it was held,
although there are decisions the other way, that a lindowner
cannot recover for the obstruction of a public water course,
the discontinuance of a public way, or the like. The ground
of such decisions is that the plaintiff's rights are subject to
superior public rights, or that he has no private right, and
that his damage, though greater in degree than that of the rest
of the public, is the same in kind. Here there is no question
of the plaintiffs' private, right..
Judgment atfirmed.
MR. JU
i; HARLAN concurs in the Judgment only so far
as it allows the item of $300.
