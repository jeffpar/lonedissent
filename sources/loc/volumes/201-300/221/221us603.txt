AMERICAN LITHOGRAPHIC COMPANY v.
WERCKMEISTER.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.

No. 115. Argued April 10, 1911.-Decided May 29, 1911.
The forfeiture for infringement of copyright prescribed by § 4965,
Rev. Stat., is not only for every copy found in possession of the infringer, but in the alternative for every copy by him sold.
Where a distinction is plainly made in an act of Congress prescribing
penalties as to different classes of the offense, the court need not search
for the reason for making the distinction but must give it effect.
Under § 4965, Rev. Stat., no penalty for infringement can be recovered with respect to prints, photographs, etc., except for sheets
found in defendant's possession, and there cannot be two actions
as to the same copies, one for replevin and the other for penalty;
but with respect to paintings, statues and statuary an action can
be brought for penalties on copies sold by the infringer and not
included in those replevied in another action. Werckmeister v.
American Tobacco Co., 207 U. S. 375; Hills v. Hoover, 220 U. S. 334,
distinguished.
The authority to issue writs conferred on courts of the United States
by § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and § 716, Rev. Stat., includes
the authority to issue subpoenas duces tecum; and it was not the
purpose of § 724, Rev. Stat., to interpose an obstacle with respect
to the issuance of such subpoenas.
The act of July 2, 1864, c. 210, § 3, 13 Stat. 351, now Rev. Stat., § 858,
removing disabilities of witnesses on account of being parties to the
action removed whatever obstacle existed as to issuing subpoenas
duces tecum to parties.
Section 860, Rev. Stat., providing that no pleading or discovery obtained from a party or witness by means of judicial proceeding shall
be used against him in any criminal proceeding, relates to using the
evidence in a subsequent proceeding.
A corporation defendant in a suit to enforce penalties under § 4965, Rev.
Stat., for infringment of copyright is not entitled under the Fourth or
Fifth Amendment to object to the admission of evidence of entries
in its books produced under a subpoena duces tecum. Wilson v.
United States, ante, p. 361.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

221 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the construction of § 4965,
Rev. Stat., are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Win. A. Jenner for plaintiff in error:

Section 4965 is a penal statute, and prosecutions under
it, although civil in form, are essentially criminal prosecutions. See Backus v. Gould, 7 How. 798, 811, construing the sixth section of the act of February 3, 1831, corresponding to §4965. Bolles v. Outing Co., 175 U. S. 262,
264; Werckmeister v. Am. Tobacco Co., 207 U. S. 375, 381.

Discovery, i. e., production of books and papers, will
not be ordered in chancery in aid of an action to enforce
penalties. See 2 Story's Eq. Jur., §§ 1319, 1494; 2 Daniel's
Ch. P1. & Pr. 1557; 2 Beach, Mod. Eq. Jur., § 871; 2
Story, Eq. Jur., § 1494; Horsburgv. Baker, 1 Pet. 232; Boyd
v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 631; United States v. Saline
Bank, 1 Pet. 100; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 563.

The exemption has always been allowed in actions for
penalties under the copyright and patent laws. Atwill v.
Ferrett, 2 Blatchf. 39; Johnson v. Donaldson, 18 Blatchf.

287; 1 Daniel's Chancery Pr., 4th Am. ed., 563; Story's
Eq. Pl., § 575; Snow v. Mast, 63 Fed. Rep. 623; Daly v.
Brady, 69 Fed. Rep. 285. Section 724 has been applied to
exempt from production in penalty cases against corporations.

United States v. NationalLead Co., 75 Fed. Rep. 94.

The compulsory production of defendant's books and
the obtaining of evidence therefrom in support of plaintiff's case was error, and the rights of plaintiff in error
under Rev. Stat., §§ 724 and 860 were violated by the
compulsory production of its books and the compulsory
reading in evidence by Mr. Eddy, its treasurer, of entries
therefrom. The subpoena duces tecum was not rightfully
available to the plaintiff to obtain production of books in
a penalty action. Section 724 governs the production of
books in an action at law. Under §724 defendant could
not rightfully be compelled to produce its books. As to

the authority to issue the subpcena duces tecum, Section
724 controls the production of book evidence from the
adversary party at the trial and excludes all other modes
of compelling production. Ex parte Fisk, 113 U. S. 713;
Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250; Hanks
Dental Assn. v. Tooth Crown Co., 194 U. S. 303.
The history of § 724 shows that its object was to provide in actions at law a method of obtaining inspection
of books and papers analogous to discovery in equity.
Owyhee Land Co. v. Tautphaus, 109 Fed. Rep. 547; Hylton's Lessee v. Brown, 1 Wash. C. C. 298; Finch v. Rikeman, 2 Blatch. 302.
In Blackstone's time the subpoena duces tecum was not
available in actions at law for bringing into court the
books of a party, and hence was not a writ "agreeable to
the usages and principles of law," under § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (Rev. Stat., § 716). In Merchants' Nat.
Bank v. State Nat. Bank, 3 Cliff. 201, the court held that
at common law parties could not be compelled to attend
or by subpcena duces tecum to produce books. United
States v. Reyburn, 6 Pet. 363; President &c. v. Hillard,
5 Cowen, 419.
In suits in equity resort has sometimes been had to subpoenas duces tecum to obtain from the adverse party production of books, as in Bischoffsheim v. Brown, 29 Fed.
Rep. 341; Johnson Steel Co. v. North Branch Co., 48 Fed.
Rep. 191, 195; Edison Elec. Co. v. U. S. Elec. Co., 44 Fed.
Rep. 294; Same v. Same, 45 Fed. Rep. 55.. But see Gregory
v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co., 10 Fed. Rep. 529; Kirkpatrick v. Pope Mfg. Co., 61 Fed. Rep. 46.
Section 724 has not been modified expressly or by implication.
Section 860 is expressly applicable to actions for the
enforcement of a penalty and prescribes that "No pleading of a party, nor any discovery or evidence obtained
from a party or witness by means of a judicial proceed-

Mr. Antonio Knauth for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment upon a
verdict in favor of Emil Werckmeister, plaintiff below.
The action was brought under § 4965, p. 959, ch. 3, of the
United States Revised Statutes, to recover penalties for
the infringement of a copyright. The subject of the
copyright was the painting "Chorus," and the penalties
demanded were for copies printed and sold by the Lithographic Company.
It is contended that the recovery was unauthorized by
the statute, for the reason that the copies were not found
in the defendant's possession. Section 4965, Rev. Stat.;
3 U. S. Comp. Stat., p. 3414, so far as material, provides:
"SEC. 4965. If any person, after the recording of the
title of any map, chart, dramatic or musical composition,
print, cut, engraving, or photograph, or chromo, or of the
description of any painting, drawing, statue, .
shall

or, knowing the same to be so printed, published, .
or imported, shall sell or expose to sale any copy of such
map or other article, as aforesaid, he shall forfeit to the
proprietor all the plates on which the same shall be copied,
and every sheet thereof, either copied or printed, and
shall further forfeit one dollar for every sheet of the same
found in his possession, either printing, printed, copied,
published, imported, or exposed for sale; and in case of a
painting, statue, or statuary, he shall forfeit ten dollars
for every copy of the same in his possession, or by him
sold or exposed for sale."

AM. LITHOGRAPHIC CO. v. WERCKMEISTER. 607
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The contention is "that the penalty attaches in the
case of a painting only under the same conditions as in the
case of a print; that the intent of the statute is to differentiate a painting from a print only in respect to the
amount of the penalty, $1 in case of a print, and $10 in
case of a painting; and that, in both cases, a finding in
possession of the defendant is a condition precedent to the
recovery of the penalty." It is further urged that only
one action can be maintained for forfeiture of the copies
and for the penalties, and that the action lies only against
the person in whose possession the copies are found, and
that the penalties are to be computed upon the number
so found.
The argument fails to give effect to the express provision of the statute. Its words are "he shall forfeit ten
dollars for every copy of the same in his possession, or by
him sold or exposed for sale." No process of construction
can override this explicit language. The prescribed forfeiture is not only for every copy found "in his possession,"
but, in the alternative, for every copy "by him sold."
We need not search for the reason for the distinction between maps, charts, photographs, prints, etc., on the one
hand, and paintings, statues and statuary on the other.
The character of the latter suggests the basis; but the
distinction is plainly made, and it must be given effect.
With respect to prints, photographs, etc., the money
penalty for the acts defined is "one dollar for every sheet
of the same found in his possession, either printing,
printed, copied, published, imported, or exposed for sale."
The words "found in his possession" limit the entire
clause. And no penalty can be recovered in such case
except for sheets found in the possession of the defendant.

bacco Company, 207 U. S. 375, related to the same copyrighted painting that is involved here. In the first case
there was a recovery in an action in the nature of replevin
of 1196 sheets containing copies. The second action was
brought to recover the money penalties for the sheets
seized in the former action. The question was whether
there could be two actions against the same party; one for
the seizure of the sheets forfeited and another for the
penalties, and it was held "that the statute contemplated
but a single action in which the defendant should be
brought into court, the plates and sheets seized and adjudicated to the owner of the copyright, and the penalty,
provided for by the statute, recovered." See Hills &
Company v. Hoover, 220 U. S. 334, 335. These decisions
did not involve the determination that an action could
not be brought to enforce the forfeiture prescribed by the
statute in a case of the sale of copies of a copyrighted
painting where there was no finding in possession, and
hence no proceeding to forfeit copies so found. Here,
there is no attempt to recover in a second action penalties
which should have been embraced in a former action;
and the recovery is based simply upon the forfeiture incurred by sales of the prohibited copies.
Assuming that the action for the penalties would lie, it
is further contended by the defendant company that its
rights under § 724, p. 137, c. 12, and § 860, p. 163, c. 17, of
the Revised Statutes were violated by the compulsory production of its books and the reception in evidence of entries
showing sales of infringing copies.
Without attempting to state in detail the proceedings
which culminated in the introduction of the book entries
in evidence, it is sufficient to say that after a review of the
course of the trial, and of the directions and rulings of the
court during its progress, we are satisfied that the enforced
production of the books cannot properly be said to rest
upon an order made under § 724, but that in fact they

AM. LITHOGRAPHIC CO. v. WERCKMEISTER. 609
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

were produced under a subpoena duces tecum served upon
the company's officer.
But, it is urged, that the books were those of a party to
the action, and hence that the limitations of § 724 must
be deemed controlling; that in actions at law this section
excludes all other modes of compelling production of books
or writings by the adversary party.
Under § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (§ 716, Rev.
Stat.), power was conferred upon the Federal courts to
issue all writs not specially provided for by statute, which
may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the practice and usages of law.
This comprehended the authority to issue subpoenas duces
tecum, for "the right to resort to means competent to compel the production of written, as well as oral, testimony,
seems essential to the very existence and constitution of a
court of common law." Amey v. Long, 9 East, 484. Section 724, which was originally § 15 of the Judiciary Act of
1789, was to meet the difficulty arising out of the rules relating to parties at common law and to provide, by motion, a substitute quoad hoc for a bill of discovery in aid of
a legal action. Carpenterv. Winn, decided this day, ante,
p. 533.
But by the act of July 2, 1864, c. 210, § 3, 13 Stat. 351,
it was provided that there should be "no exclusion of
any witness on account of color, nor in civil actions because he is a party to, or interested in, the issue tried."
This provision was continued in § 858 of the Revised
Statutes. "The purpose of the act in making the parties competent was, except as to those named in the proviso, to put them upon a footing of equality with other
witnesses, all to be admissible to testify for themselves
and compellable to testi y for the others." Texas v.
Chiles, 21 Wall. 488, p. 492. Section 858 was amended by
the act of June 29, 1906, ch. 3608 (34 Stat. 618), which refers the competency of witnesses in the courts of the

United States to the laws of the State or Territory in
which the court is held.
It was not the purpose of § 724 to interpose an obstacle
to the exercise of the general power of the court with respect to the issuance of subpcenas duces tecum, and that
was not its effect. The barrier, in the case of parties,
existed independently of the provisions of the section and
by these it was sought to mitigate the resulting inconvenience. When, however, the rule as to parties was
changed it followed that the obstacle was removed and by
virtue of the general authority of the court subpcenas duces
tecum may run to parties as well as to others,-leaving
those who are subpend to attack the process if of improper scope or lacking in definiteness, or to assert against
its compulsion whatever privileges they may enjoy. See
Merchants' National Bank v. State National Bank, 3 Cliff.
203, 204; Nelson v. United States, 201 U. S.92.
We conclude, therefore, that no question arises under
§ 724, which cannot be regarded as providing an exclusive
procedure. The subpoena was valid; and the books called
for were produced. The inquiry, then, is as to the admissibility of the entries.
It is insisted that the evidence was inadmissible under
§ 860 of the Revised Statutes. This ground, although it
had been relied upon earlier in the trial, was not included
in the objection-as it was formally stated at lengthwhen the books were finally produced and the entries offered. But, apart from this, the statute did not afford a
sufficient basis for objection.
Section 860-since repealed by the act of May 7, 1910,
ch. 216 (36 Stat. 352),--was a reenactment of § 1 of the
act of February 25, 1868, ch. 13 (15 Stat. 37), and provided:
"SEc. 860. No pleading of a party, nor any discovery
or evidence obtained from a party or witness by means of
a judicial proceeding in this or any foreign country, shall

AM. LITHOGRAPHIC CO. v. WERCKMEISTER. 611

Opinion of the Court.

be given in evidence, or in any manner used against him or
his property or estate, in any court of the United States,
in any criminal proceeding, or for the enforcement of any
penalty or forfeiture: Provided, That this section shall
not exempt any party or witness from prosecution and
punishment for perjury committed in discovering or testifying as aforesaid."
This language is inapposite here, for it manifestly refers
to a case where, in some prior judicial proceeding, discovery had been made or testimony had been given and
the evidence so obtained was sought to be used. The object of the statute is sufficiently plain. It was intended to
give immunity as to subsequent proceedings to the one
making discovery or testifying. But it was held to be inadequate, because it was not co-extensive with the constitutional privilege. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S.
547, 564; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 594.
In the present case, the question, therefore, must be
whether under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States the defendant Company,
as it contends, was entitled to object to the admission in
evidence of the entries from its books. As to this, we
need only refer to the recent decisions of this court. Hale
v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43; Nelson v. United States, supra;
Hammond Packing Company v. Arkansas, 212 U. S. 348,
349; Wilson v. United States, decided May 15, 1911, ante,
p. 361.
We have examined the errors assigned with respect to
other rulings on questions of evidence and the refusal of
the court to direct a verdict for the defendant, and we
find no ground for a reversal of the judgment.
Affirmed.
