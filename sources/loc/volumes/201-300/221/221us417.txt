the court.
This is a companion case with Texas & New Orleans R.
R. Co. v. Miller, just decided, ante, p. 408, and arose out of
the derailment of the same engine. It took substantially
the same course in the state courts, (128 S. W. Rep. 1173)
and presents substantially the same questions.
For the reasons given in the other case, the motion to
dismiss is denied, and that to affirm is granted.
