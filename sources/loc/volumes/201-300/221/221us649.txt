FABER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 134.

Submitted April 20, 1911.-Decided May 29, 1911.

Quaere and purposely not decided whether the reduction in tariff rates
provided by § 2 of the treaty with Cuba of 1903 is limited to rates
of duty in general tariff acts and does not apply to special rates
under special agreements with other countries. Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190.
The treaty with Cuba of 1903 was signed and proclaimed after the

decisions of this court in the Insular Cases to the effect that Porto
Rico and the Philippine Islands were not foreign countries; and
within the meaning of that treaty the Philippines are not a foreign
country or another country, and the reduction of tariff on articles
imported from Cuba are not to be based on tariff rates on the same
articles brought from the Philippine Islands.
In the absence of some qualifying phrase the word "country" in the
revenue laws of the United States embrace all provinces of a state
no matter how widely separated and the Philippines are a part of
the United States within the meaning of the treaty with Cuba of
1903.
The duties imposed and collected on articles coming into the United
States from the Philippine Islands are not covered into the treasury
of the United States but are used and expended solely for the use
and government of those Islands and are not to be regarded as duties
on imports from foreign countries within the meaning of the treaty
with Cuba of 1903.
The word "imports" is the correlative of the word "exports" and
preferential rates granted to Cuba under the treaty of 1903 relate
only to duties on imports from countries foreign to the United
States.
The provisions of Art. VIII of the treaty with Cuba of 1903 will not
be construed so as to give that country advantages over shipments
coming into the United States from a part of its own territory.
157 Fed. Rep. 140, affirmed on the above points.

Tins case raises the question as to whether Cuban
imports are entitled to a reduction of twenty per cent
upon the rates charged on goods coming from the Philip-

pine Islands, or only twenty per cent upon the regular
tariff rates on goods imported from foreign countries.
The Tariff Act of July 24, 1897, lays a duty on cigars of

$4.50 per pound and twenty-five per cent ad valorem.
The act of March 8, 1902, § 2, c. 140, 32 Stat., 54,
to raise revenue for the Philippine Islands, provides that
there shall be "levied, collected and paid upon all articles
coming into the United States from the Philippine Archipelago the rates of duty which are required to be collected
and paid upon like articles imported from foreign countries: Provided "that upon all articles the growth and

product of the Philippine Archipelago coming into the
United States from the Philippine Archipelago there shall
be levied, collected and paid only seventy-five per centum of
the rates of duty aforesaid. . . . All duties and taxes
collected in the United States upon articles coming from
the Philippine Archipelago . . . shall not be covered into the general fund of the Treasury of the United
States, but shall be held as a separate fund and paid into
the Treasury of the Philippine Islands to be used and
expended for the government and benefit of said islands."
(32 Stat. 54; 5 Fed. Stat. Ann. 716.)
The Commercial Convention with Cuba, proclaimed
December 17, 1903 (33 Stat. 2136), declares, in Article 2,
"that during the term of this convention all merchandise . . . being the product of the soil or industry of
the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States
shall be admitted at a reduction of twenty per centum of
the rates of duty thereon, as provided by the tariff act of
the United States, approved July 24, 1897, or as may be
provided by any tariff law of the United States subsequently enacted."
Article 8, p. 2140, 33 Stat. provides that "the rates of
duty herein granted by the United States to the Republic of
Cuba are and shall continue during the term of this convention preferential in respect to all like imports from other
countries, and, in return for said preferential rates of duty
granted to the Republic of Cuba by the United States,
it is agreed that the concession herein granted on the
part of the said Republic of Cuba to the products of the
United States shall likewise be, and shall continue, during
the term of this convention, preferential in respect to all
like imports from other countries."
In April, 1906, the convention and statutes above referred to being of force, the plaintiffs imported cigars and
alcohol into the United States from Cuba. He contended
that under the convention he could only be required to

pAy a duty twenty per cent less than that collected on
tobacco coming into the United States from Philippine
Islands which paid seventy-five per cent of the regular
rate under the Tariff Act of July, 1897. He also claimed
that he should not be required to pay twenty per cent less
than the regular tariff on alcohol, but twenty per cent less
than special rates allowed on importations of alcohol
from France, Germany,. Italy and Portugal.
His claim being disallowed he paid, under protest, a
duty of twenty per cent less than the tariff rate on cigars
and alcohol. On a hearing by the Board of Appraisers
his protest was overruled. That judgment was affirmed
by the Circuit Court (157 Fed. Rep. 140) and the case was
brought here.
Mr. Edward S. Hatch and Mr. Walter F. Welch for
appellants:
A treaty is governed by the same rules of law as other

By international usage, which must govern in the construction of a treaty between two nations, the Philippines
must be regarded as falling within the phrase "other
countries" in a commercial convention having to do
with tariff rates between Cuba and the United States.
T. D. 24051; T. D. 28401; Int. Rev. Circ. No. 581; Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516; Dorr v. United
States, 195 U. S. 138. Canada, India, Australia, or New
Zealand, each having its own customs and revenue system, Would be regarded for the purposes of a commercial
convention as "other countries," as to Great Britain,
although they were possessions of that country.
If the present movement for the consummation of a
reciprocity treaty with Canada succeeds it ought to be
made known by this court whether Cuba can be discriminated against and deprived of the benefit of her agreement with the United States, and whether numerous
articles can be admitted free of duty from Canada by
agreement without according to Cuba the same rights
under the treaty now in existence. If Cuba can be discriminated against in any of these ways the promise of
the United States in the Cuban treaty cannot mean
anything to the effect that Cuban products shall have
a preference over all like imports from other countries. If the United States for any reason is not willing
to carry out its agreement with Cuba then there is

ample provision therein for denouncing the same, and
until that time it should be carried out according to its
terms.
Mr. D. Frank Lloyd, Assistant Attorney General, and
Mr. Charles E. McNabb, for the United States:
The Philippine Islands are neither a "foreign country"
nor an "other country," within the meaning of the Cuban
convention.
For definitions of "foreign country" see The Ship Adventure, 1 Brock. 235, 241; Fed. Cas. 202, 204; The Boat
Eliza, 2 Gall. 4; 8 Fed. Cas. 455, 456; Taber v. United
States, 1 Story, 1; 23 Fed. Cas. 611, 613, 614.
Upon ratification of the treaty of peace with Spain the
Philippines and other islands therein ceded to the United
States ceased to be foreign and became territory of the
United States subject to such tariff legislation as Congress
might deem proper. Insular Cases in Vol. 182 U. S. Reports; Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United States, 183 U. S.
176, 178, 179, 181, 182; United States v. Heinszen, 206
U. S. 370, 379, 380.
The words "foreign country" appear only in § 28 of the
Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890. The word
"country" without the adjective "foreign" appears in
§§ 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 19. There can be no doubt whatever that foreign country is invariably meant by the
word "country," because the Customs Administrative
Act relates only to merchandise imported from foreign
countries. See United States v. The Recorder, 1 Blatchf.
218; 27 Fed. Cas. 718, 720, 721; Stairs v. Peaslee, 18 How.
521, 526.
The term "country" as used in the law is to be regarded as embracing all the possessions of a nation, however widely separated, which are subject to the same
supreme executive and legislative authority and control.
(Cust. Reg. 1857, art. 300; Cust. Reg. 1874, art. 432;

Cust. Reg. 1899, art. 1254; Cust. Reg. 1908, art. 873.)
The legal effect of contemporaneous and long-continued
construction and practice of the executive department
charged with the administration of the law has been repeatedly declared by the courts. United States v. The
Recorder, and Stairs v. Peaslee, supra, are in point. For
recent decisions of this court, sustaining such construction
and practice, see: United States v. Falk, 204 U. S. 143,
152; United States v. Cerecedo, 209 U. S. 337, 339; Komada
v. United States, 215 U. S. 392, 396.
The words "other countries" appearing in
Art. VIII of
the Cuban convention, supra, are inapplicable to the
Philippine Islands, as is shown by the context and the
purpose.
Article VIII declares that the concession made in said
convention shall be "preferential in respect to all like
imports from other countries." The words "imports
from other countries" do not refer to goods coming into
the United States from the Philippine Islands. "Import," "imports," "imported," and "importation" are
used in the customs laws to refer only to merchandise
brought into the United States from a foreign country
the same as the correlative terms "export," "exports,"
"exported," and "exportation" are applied to merchandise carried out of the United States to a foreign country.

Horst, 93 U. S. 291, 300; Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S.
197, 212.
The law governing tariff relations with the Philippine
Islands is for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof and not
to provide revenue for the Government of the United
States.
The far-reaching effect of the construction contended
for by appellants would accomplish results entirely inconsistent with the purpose of Congress, to wit, cigars
and other articles would be imported from Cuba in effective competition with, and perhaps to the exclusion of,
similar products of the Philippine Islands, and articles on
the free list which do not come into the United States
from those islands would be imported from Cuba to the
detriment of American industries.
Article VIII of the Cuban convention provides that the
rates. of duty granted to Cuba shall be "preferential in
respect to all like imports from other countries," and then
provides that in return therefor the concession to products of the United States shall likewise be "preferential
in respect to all like imports from other countries."
The words "other countries" must mean the same
thing in both clauses, and it is obvious that the latter
clause cannot include the Philippine Islands because the
word "preferential" is predicated upon and pre-supposes
a treaty or convention with another country prejudicial to
the United States. Cuba could not enter into such a
treaty or convention with the Philippine Islands as a
country.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

Article 2 of the Convention with Cuba provides that
the products of that island shall be admitted into the

221 U. S.

United States at a reduction of twenty per cent of the
rates of duty in the Tariff of 1897, or tariff laws subsequently enacted. There is much force in the suggestion
that the reduction is limited to the rates of duty in general
tariff acts, and does not apply to special rates under
special agreements with other countries. Whitney v.
Robertson, 124 U. S. 190. This point, however, we purposely leave open and limit our consideration to the
principal question discussed in the brief, whether the
Philippine Islands are "another country" within the
meaning of the eighth article of the Cuban Treaty, providing that the rates therein granted shall continue "preferential in respect to all like imports from other countries."
This treaty was signed and proclaimed several years
after it had been decided, in the Insular Cases, that Porto
Rico and the'Philippine Islands were not foreign countries,
but territory of the United States, subject to such laws
as Congress might enact for their political and fiscal management. In 1901 this court, in Fourteen Diamond Rings
v. The United States, 183 U. S. 176, 178, said that "the
theory that a country remains foreign with respect to the
tariff laws, until Congress has acted by embracing it within
the Customs Union, presupposes that the country may be
domestic for one purpose and foreign for another." That
case and DeLima v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1; United States v.
Heinszen, 206 U. S. 370; Dooley v. United States, 183 U. S.
151, show that, notwithstanding their geographical remoteness, the Philippines are not a foreign country, and,
if so, not "another country" within the meaning of the
Cuban Treaty.
There have been statutes in which the language indicated an intent to make a distinction between a country
and its colonies. But in the absence of some qualifying
phrase "the word country in the revenue laws of the
United States has always been construed to embrace all

FABER v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

the possessions of a foreign State, however widely separated, which are subject to the same supreme executive
and legislative control." Stairs v. Peaslee, 18 How. 521,
526. If, therefore, in our revenue laws, a colony is treated
as a part of the country to which it belongs, the Philippine Islands must be treated as a part of this Nation and
not as another country. It must be presumed that the
words "other country" in the Cuban Treaty were used
according to their known and established interpretation,
Ibid, and did not refer to charges on shipments from territory belonging to the United States. That they were
not so regarded appears from the language of the act of
March 8, 1902, 32 Stat., c. 140, which studiously avoids
using the words "imports," and enacts that upon articles
"coming into the United States from the Philippine Archipelago," there shall be levied only seventy-five per cent
of the rates of duty imposed on like articles imported
from foreign countries. These duties, when collected,
are not covered into the Treasury of the United States,
but are to be used and expended solely for the use and
government of the Philippine Islands.
But it is argued that even if the United States understood the Philippine Islands to be a part of this country, Cuba could not be expected to understand that the
words "other countries" did not include the Philippines
if a duty was in fact charged on goods coming from those
islands.
But the eighth article refers to "imports "-the correlative of "exports." This necessarily related to shipments
from a country which was foreign to the United States.
Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Louisiana, 156 U. S. 590, 600; Patapsco Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S.345, 353. The provision that the rates granted to Cuba shall continue
"preferential in respect to all like imports from other
countries," does not relate to charges on shipments between places under the same flag, but to duties laid on ship-

221 U. S.

ments-on imports-from countries which are foreign
to the United States. Both in the light of our own legislation and in view of the generally accepted interpretation
of the word "imports," the eighth article of the treaty cannot be construed to have been intended to give to Cuba
an advantage over shipments of merchandise coming into
the United States from a part of its own territory, where
the collections were in part made as a means for raising
revenue for the support of the government of the Philippine Islands. Cuba was given a preferential of twenty
per cent over tariff rates on imports from countries which
are foreign to the United States.
We make no ruling as to the duty to be charged on
alcohol, because in the brief of the Government it is said
that without conceding plaintiff's contention to be sound,
and for reasons unnecessary to state, it consents to a reversal of so much of the judgment as relates to alcohol.
It will be so ordered. The judgment of the Circuit Court
as to the rate of duty on the cigars is
Affirmed.
