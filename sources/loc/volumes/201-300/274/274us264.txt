of the Fifth Amendment to say that it authorized a man
to refuse to state the amount of his income because it
,had been made in crime. But if the defendant desired
to test that or any other point he should have tested it
in the return so that it could be passed upon. He could
not draw a conjurer's circle around the whole matter by
his own declaration that to write any word upon the government blank would bring him into danger of the law.
Mason v. United States, 244 U. S. 362. United States
ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273
U. S. 103. In this case the defendant did not even make
a declaration, he simply abstained from making a return.
See further the decision of the Privy Council, Minister
of Finance v. Smith, [1927] A. C. 193.

It is urged that if a return were made the defendant
would be entitled to deduct illegal expenses such as
bribery. This by no means follows, but it will be time
enough to consider the question when a taxpayer has the
temerity to raise it.
Judgment reversed.
UNITED STATES v. ALFORD.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA.

No. 983.

Argued April 28, 1927.-Decided May 16, 1927.

1. In the Act of June 25, 1910, providing that "whoever shall build
a fire in or near any forest, timber, or other inflammable material
upon the public domain, or upon any Indian reservation
shall, before leaving said fire, totally extinguish the same; and
whoever shall fail to do so shall" be punished, etc., the words
"upon the public domain" are to be referred to the words immediately preceding, viz., "forest, timber, or other inflammable material," so that the statute applies where the fire is on private lands,
but "near" to inflammable grass on the public domain. P. 266.

Argument for the United States.

2. The Act, so construed, is constitutional; for Congress may prohibit the doing of acts upon privately owned lands that imperil the
publicly owned forests. P. 267.
3. The word "near" is not too indefinite. P. 267.
Reversed.

ERROR to a judgment of the District Court sustaining a

demurrer to an indictment.
Mr. R. W. Williams, Solicitor, Department of Agriculture, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell, and Messrs.
Fred Lees, and H. H. Clarke were on the brief, for the
United States.
The statutory language is reasonably plain. Where the
words of a statute are susceptible of two constructions,
the broader of which will carry out fully the evident legislative purpose, and the narrower will so unduly restrict
its operation as to render it largely ineffective to accomplish that purpose, the construction should be adopted
which will give full effect to the known intent of Congress in its enactment. Millard v. Roberts, 202 U. S. 429.
This evident legislative purpose can be subserved only if
the statute be construed as prohibiting the leaving unextinguished of all fires which, by reason of being built in
or near the timber on the public domain, constitute a
menace thereto. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385;
Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S. 47; Ash Sheep
Co. v. United States, 252 U. S. 159.
The application to the words of this statute of that
construction which will effectuate the known legislative
intent is not violative of the rule that criminal and penal
statutes will be strictly construed. Ash Sheep Co. v.
United States, 252 U. S. 159; United States v. Bowman,
260 U. S. 94; Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S. 1;

to prohibit one from leaving unextinguished a fire built by
him on private land, but near timber or other inflammable
material, upon the public domain. Hamilton v. Kentucky

No appearance for defendant in error.
MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Alford was indicted for building a fire near inflammable grass and other inflammable material and timber
situated upon the public domain of the United States,
and for not extinguishing the same before leaving it, by
reason of which the said grass and other material was
burned. The count was demurred to on the ground that
the statute concerned does not cover the building or leaving of fires at any place except upon a forest reservation, and that if it attempts to cover fires elsewhere it is
unconstitutional and void. The District Court construed
the statute in the same way and sustained the demurrer.
A writ of error was taken by the United States.
By the Act of June 25, 1910, c, 431, ยง 6; 36 Stat. 855,
857, amending ยง 53 of the Penal Code of March 4, 1909,
"Whoever shall build a fire in or near any forest, timber,
or other inflammable material upon the public domain,
or upon any Indian reservation, or lands belonging to or

Opinion of the Court.

occupied by any tribe of Indians under the authority of
the United States, or upon any Indian allotment while
the title to the same shall be held in trust by the Government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by
the allottee without the consent of the United States,

shall, before leaving said fire, t6tally extinguish the
same; and whoever shall fail to do so shall be fined not

more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more
than one year, or both." The Court read the words
' upon the public domain' as qualifying the phrase ' whoever shall build a fire.' We are of opinion that this was
error, and that 'upon the public domain' should be referred to the words immediately preceding it: 'forest,
timber, or other inflammable material.'-So interpreted,
they make better English and better sense. The purpose of the Act is to prevent forest fires which have been
one of the great economic misfortunes of the country.
The danger depends upon the nearness of the fire, not
upon the ownership of the land where it is built. It is
said that the construction that we adopt has been followed by the Department of Justice and by a number
of cases in the District Courts ever since the passage of
the original Act of February 24, 1897, c. 313; 29"Stat. 594.
We regard the meaning as too plain to be shakeA by the
suggestion that criminal statutes are to be construed
strictly. They also are to be construed with common
sense.
The statute is constitutional. Congress may prohibit
the doing of acts upon privately owned lands that imperil the publicly owned forests. Camfield v. United
States, 167 U. S. 518. See McKelvey v. United States,
260 U. S. 353. The word 'near' is not too indefinite.
Taken in connection with the danger to be prevented it
lays down a plain enough rule of conduct for anyone who
seeks to obey the law.
Judgment reversed.
