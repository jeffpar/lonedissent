EMPIRE TRUST CO. v. CAHAN.
Argument for Petitioner.

EMPIRE TRUST COMPANY v. CAHAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 318. Argued April 29, 1927.-Decided May 31, 1927.
Where an adult son, under an unlimited power of attorney given by
his father, drew checks on his father's accounts in two banks, to
his own order or the order of a third bank, signing them with his
fathers name by himself as attorney, and deposited them to his
own private account in the third bank, and subsequently (the
checks having been honored by the drawee banks) drew out the
funds from the third bank and applied them to his own se, and
these transactions went on for over two years, the notice gained
from the form of his checks was not. sufficient to charge that bank
with knowledge of the misappropriations. P. 479.
9 F. (2d) 713, reversed.

CERTIORARI (271 U. S. 653) to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which affirmed a judgment of the
District Court, recovered from the petitioner by the
respondent.

Mr. Van Vechten Veeder, with whom Messrs. William
Lee Woodward and William J. Dean were on the brief,
for petitioner.
The fact that an agent acts for his own benefit without
actual authority is immaterial as against a third person
who deals with the agent on the face of his apparent
authority. North River Bank v. Aymar, 3 Hill (N. Y.)

A fiduciary having general authority to draw funds
must necessarily have power to direct their disposition.
The deposit with the bank did not operate to take the
funds out of the fiduciary's control. So long as the funds
remained in his control they were not diverted. Accord-

ingly, it is almost universally held that a fiduciary, of
whatsoever kind, may deposit the funds of his principal
in a bank to his individual credit. Whiting v. Hudson
Trust Co., 234 N. Y. 394; Kendall v. Fidelity Trust Co.,
230 Mass. 238; Santa Marina Co. v. CanadianBank, 254
Fed. 391. Knowledge on the part of the bank of the
nature of the funds received does not affect the character
of the act. The bank has the right to assume that a
fiduciary will apply the funds to their proper use under
the trust. Bischoff v. Yorkville Bank, 218 N. Y. 106;

The Privy Council held that the defendant was not put
on notice.
If the respondent could deposit the funds in his own
account, he could draw them out. If the former constituted no notice of diversion, neither would the latter.
The law does not require the bank to assume the hazard
of correctly reading in each check the purpose of the
drawer. Bischoff v. Yorkville Bank, supra; Kendall v.

Argument for Respondent.

The petitioner had no actual knowledge of any infirmity or defect in the checks. Neither their form nor the
circumstances of their negotiation by the fiduciary made
petitioner guilty of bad faith in receiving them for his
account. There is no distinction between the checks
naming petitioner as payee and those naming the fiduciary. A payee as well as an endorsee may be a holder in
due course. Armstrong v. Amer. Exch. Bank, 133 U. S.

represent fiduciary funds is sufficient evidence of misappropriation to impose upon the bank a duty of inquiry.

L. Rep. 330. Distinguishing, Conn. Say. Bank v. Nat.
Surety Co., 294 Fed. 261.
The feature of benefit to the recipient of the funds is
immaterial, and the reason for the rule is that the use of
the funds by the fiduciary to satisfy his individual indebtedness is clear evidence of use of the fiduciary funds for
individual purposes. That the test is notice of misappropriation rather than benefit received by the bank is
made clear by the decision of this Court in Manhattan
Bank'v. Walker, 130 U. S. 267. See also, Ward v. City
Trust Co., 192 N. Y. 61; Havana Cent. R. R. v. Knickerbocker Trust Co., 135 App. Div. 316; Niagara Woolen
Co. v. Pacific Bank, 141 App. Div. 265.
The difficulty of imagining any reason why the principal's interests would be promoted by transfer of his
funds to his agent's individual bank account is sufficient
evidence of the violence of the assumption that the fiduciary would use the funds in the principal's interest.
It is inconsistent to argue that the bank is not entitled
to assume that money rightfully belongs to a fiduciary
when it takes it in payment of an indebtedness owed to
it, but is entitled so to assume when it deposits it to the
fiduciary's individual account and so places him in a position to use it for the payment of his individual indebtedness to others. We see no inconvenience in a rule which
would require banks to give general instructions to their
tellers not to permit, without special authority based
upon adequate inquiry, the deposit to individual credit
of a check drawn or endorsed by a fiduciary in his fiduciary capacity. Nor do we perceive any possibility of
embarrassment as between banks and their customers.
Banks are now obliged to explain to their depositors that
under the law they cannot take fiduciary funds in payment of an individual indebtedness of the fiduciary.
The principle that the form of the check charges the
bank with notice that the funds are fiduciary funds is too
deeply rooted now to be questioned. Bischoff v. Yorkvifle Bank, 218 N. Y. 106;.Ha/e v. Windsor Say. Bank,

The fiduciary did not have actual authority either to

benefit of the checks when drawn. He had no apparent
authority to do these things as to any third person who
was put on notice that he was acting for his own benefit.

anty Trust Company, in New York, and deposited with
the petitioner by the respondent's son. The respondent,
a Canadian lawyer, had accounts with the two banks
named and, in 1916, gave to his son powers of attorney
to draw checks upon them, both powers being general
and with no qualification as to the purposes for which
such checks might be drawn. Beginning in July of that
year, and from time to time down to October, 1918, the

son drew checks signed with his father's name by himself
as attorney against his father's two accounts, payable
seventeen to his own order, three to the order of the
petitioner, and deposited them to his own private account
with the petitioner. All the checks but two were certified by the Guaranty Trust Company or accepted by the
other bank as the case might be. Subsequently the son
drew out these funds and applied them to his own use.
The respondent did not discover the fraud until the end
of 1919, at which time his son absconded. The petitioner
had no knowledge that the son was misappropriating his
father's money and no notice other than what was given
by the form of the checks. The District Court and the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that
notice sufficient to charge the petitioner as matter of law
and gave judgment against it, the Circuit Court of Appeals adding interest on the several items from the date
when they were credited to the son. 9 F. (2d) 713. A
writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 271 U. S.
653.
No doubt the question is, as was said by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, a question of degree, like most questions in the law; but we are of opinion that the Court
below applied too strict a rule to an ordinary business
transaction. The Court itself pronounced it "a hard rule
as business is ordinarily conducted," and seemingly
adopted it as much because of authority by which it felt
bound as because it confidently thought the rule right.

EMPIRE TRUST CO. v. CAHAN.
473

Opinion of the Court.

The petitioner had notice that the checks were drawn
upon the respondent's account, but they were drawn in
pursuance of an unlimited authority. We do not perceive
on what ground the petitioner could be held bound to
assume that checks thus lawfully drawn were required to
be held or used for one purpose rather than another. In
the case of checks drawn by a corporation, not likely to
disburse except for corporate purposes, there might be
stronger reasons for requiring a bank to be on its guard
if an officer having power to draw them deposited checks
for considerable sums to his private account; but it recently has been held otherwise by the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council. CorporationAgencies, Limited v.
Home Bank of Canada [1927] A. C. 318. And when the
two parties are father and son, both of mature years and
in good standing, secret limitations of the power are a
pure matter of speculation into which it seems to us extravagant to expect the bank to inquire. The person
reposing confidence in the son was not the petitioner but
the respondent, National Safe Deposit, Savings & Trust
Co. v. Hibbs, 229 U. S. 391, 397, and he himself tells us
that his confidence was unlimited. He put his deposits absolutely into his son's power; and the son, if he drew currency, as he might, could do with it as he saw fit. The
notice to the bank was notice only of this relation of the
parties. The petitioner, in permitting the son to draw
out the money was permitting only what it, like the
respondent's banks, would have been bound to allow even
if the deposit had been earmarked as a trust. The form
in which the withdrawals took place does not appear.
They might have been, like the deposits, in checks to the
son's own order. All that is known is that the respondent
did not get the benefit of them. But we do not place our
decision upon that narrow ground. For in addition to
what we have said, the transactions went on for over tw5
years and the petitioner fairly might expect the respond-
