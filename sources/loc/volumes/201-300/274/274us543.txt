of the statute here under consideration, in so far as it
requires that there shall be included in the gross estate
the value of property transferred by a decedent prior to
its passage merely because the conveyance was intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his
death, is arbitrary, capricious and amounts to confiscation.
Whether or how far the challenged provision is valid in
respect of transfers made subsequent to the enactment,
we need not now consider.
The judgment of the court below is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES,

Argued April 19, 20, 1927.-Decided May 31, 1927.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Syllabus.

274 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The statement of the petition for certiorari that the
judgment and opinion below might seriously hinder future administration of the law was grave and sufficiently
probable to justify issuance of the writ.
Proper decision of the controversy depends upon a
question of fact. Did the American Tobacco Company
become party to the unlawful combination of tobacco
jobbers at Philadelphia to maintain prices? After considering much evidence the Commission gave affirmative
answer to that query; but the Circuit Court of Appeals
thought there was nothing to support their view. 9
Fed. (2d) 570.
It now appears to us that this matter of fact is of no
general importance. Accordingly, we adhere to the usual
rule of non-interference where conclusions of Circuit
Courts of Appeals depend on appreciation of circumstances which admit of different interpretations. And
upon that ground alone we affirm the judgment below.
The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals is of uncertain intendment and is not satisfactory as an exposition of the law. What this Court has said in many opinions indicates clearly enough the general purpose of the
statute and the necessity of applying it with strict regard
thereto.
Affirmed.
JOINES v. PATTERSON ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.

No. 298. Argued April 26, 1927.-Decided May 31, 1927.
1. Conclusions of a state supreme court based upon questions of federal law wrongly determined, and acted upon, require a reversal of
the judgment and remand of the cause for further proceedings.
