OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Argument for the United States.

274 U. S.

The decree of the District Court to enjoin proceedings
which the defendant threatens to bring under the Act
against the plaintiffs should be affirmed, but the decree
below is modified and reversed so far as it purports to
enjoin the defendant from proceeding further in prosecuting the information under that Act against the plaintiffs now pending in the state criminal court.
The decree is in part reversed and in part affirmed.
UNITED STATES v. FREIGHTS,

OF S. S.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 267. Argued April 14, 1927.--Decided May 31, 1927.
1. A decree of the District Court dismissing a suit for want of
admiralty jurisdiction was appealable to this Court under Jud.
Code § 238. P. 469.
2. A suit in admiralty to enforce a shipowner's lien on sub-freights of
the ship may be brought in rem against such freights, in the district
where the debtor resides. P. 470.
3. The jurisdiction is not ousted by an answer denying that such
freights are due. P. 471.
4. Jurisdiction in rem in admiralty is determined by the allegations
of the libel. It may be defeated upon the trial by proof that the
res does not exist. P. 471.
291 Fed. 92, reversed.

libel in admiralty for want of jurisdiction.
APPEAL

Assistant Attorney General Farnum,with whom Solicitor General Mitchell and Messrs. Clinton M. Hester and
W. Clifton Stone, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, were on the brief, for the United States.
The provisions of the charter gave the shipowner a,
valid lien upon subfreights which could be enforced by
an admiralty proceeding in rem. Once the existence of

the lien is conceded, the right to a remedy in rem is a
necessary corollary upon familiar admiralty principles.
Amer. Barge Co. v. C. & 0. Coal Co., 115 Fed. 669. The
refusal of a cargo owner to comply with the directions in
the monition and to cover the unpaid part of the freight
into the registry of the court can not affect the jurisdiction of the court which had attached at the time of the
filing of the libel. Snow v. 180 Tons of Iron, 11 Fed.
517; Carver, Carriage by Sea, 7th ed., p. 930; Freightsof

Thorbjorm v. Harrison & Co., 260 Fed. 287; Tagart v.
Fisher, 9 Asp. 381 (Court of Appeal). The loss of the
lien on the cargo as result of its delivery to the consignee
does not affect the lien upon the subfreights, which persists as long as such freights or any part thereof remain
unpaid. The Sarpfos, 1925 A. M. C. 137.
The jurisdiction of the court attached upon the filing
of the libel containing the requisite jurisdictional allegations and was perfected upon the issuance of a monition
and its service upon the cargo owner. Thereafter, the
right of the court to proceed and hear the case on the
merits was not defeated by the mere filing of the defensive
pleadings, although presented with the utmost good faith.
The authorities dealing with the character of recoupment or set-off in admiralty proceedings clearly oppose
themselves to any such results as have been reached in

jurisdictional issue at all in a strict sense. Sperry Gyroscope Co. v. Arma Eng. Co., 271 U. S. 232; The Resolute,

Messrs. Thomas Hunt and John H. Lowrance, with
whom Mr. Robert H. Holt was on the brief, for appellee.
The jurisdiction in rem of the admiralty is founded
upon physical power over the res, and upon the theory
that the res proceeded against is " a contracting or offending entity," either a "debtor or offending thing,"-a thing
which can be arrested and taken into custody, which can
be fairly designated as tangible property, or the proceeds
of tangible property, and is physically within the territorial jurisdiction of the court-in the case of the District
Courts of the United States, "within the district." The

384; Cooperv. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308; Ex parte Indiana
Transp. Co., 244 U. S. 456; Benedict, Admiralty, 5th ed.,
vol. I, §§ 11, 297; Hughes, Admiralty, 2d ed., pp. 400-401.
This claim against Palmer & Parker Co., a disputed
chose in action, falls far short of fulfilling these requirements. It is a pure abstraction, a mere intellectual concept. It cannot possibly be regarded as a "contracting
entity"; such terms as "arrest" and "take into custody"
can have no proper application to it; it is certainly not
tangible property or its proceeds; and it cannot properly
be described as being "within the district" of the court.
It is no more a res than would be a pending claim to recover damages, or compensation, for a tort. No decision
of this Court, and no decision of any Circuit Court of
Appeals, holdsethat a claim such as this can be proceeded
against in the admiralty by means of a libel in rem, at
least as the sole res. Distinguishing, Amer. Barge Co. v.
C. & 0. Coal Co., 115 Fed. 669; FrontierS. S. Co. v. Central Coal Co., 234 Fed. 30; Vane v, Wood Co., 231 Fed,

Even if there were such a res, it was never within the
lawful custody of the court. The custody of property is
a physical matter, and implies immediate physical control.
MR. JUsTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a libel in admiralty against sub-freight alleged

to be in the hands of the Palmer and Parker Company of
Boston in the District of Massachusetts. It was dismissed by the District Court for lack of jurisdiction, 291
Fed. 92, and the decree having been entered on March 17,
1925, before the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, §§ 1,
14; 43 Stat. 936, 938, 942, went into effect, a direct appeal
was taken to this Court under §,238 of the Judicial Code.
The Ira M. Hedges, 218 U. S. 264, 270.
The United States, owner of the Steamship Mount
Shasta, in May, 1920, made a bare boat charter of the
vessel to the Mount Shasta Steamship Company through
Victor S. Fox and Company, Inc., an agent of that codnpany, stipulating for a lien upon all cargoes and all subfreights for any amounts due under the charter party.
Victor S. Fox and Company in July, 1920, made a subcharter to Palmer and Parker Company for a voyage to
bring a cargo of mahogany logs from the Gold Coast,
Africa, to Boston. The vessel arrived in Boston with its
cargo on February 19, 1921. There is due to the libellant
$289,680 for the hire of the steamship, and the libel alleges that there is due and unpaid freight on the cargo of
logs, $100,000, more or less, in the hands of Palmer and
Parker Company, on which this libel seeks to establish a
lien. It prays a monition against Palmer and Parker
Company and all persons interested, commanding payment of the freight money into Court, &c. Palmer and

Parker Company was served. That Company filed exceptions to the libel, denied the jurisdiction of the Court
and answered alleging ignorance of the original charter
party and of the relations of the United States and the'
Mount Shasta S. S. Company to the vessel, and setting
up counterclaims more than sufficient to exhaust the
freight. The cargo had been delivered. The District
Court assumed that a libel in rem could be maintained
against freight money admitted to be due and payable,
but was of opinion that the fund must exist when the
suit is begun, or that the jurisdiction fails. The Court
held that where, as here, the liability was denied in good
faith, it did not appear that there was any res to be proceeded against and that the suit must be dismissed. The
counsel for Palmer and Parker Company pressed the same
considerations here in a somewhat more extreme form.
By the general logic of the law a debt may be treated
as a res as easily as a ship. It is true that it is not tangible, but it is a right of the creditor's, capable of being
attached and appropriated by the law to the creditor's
duties. The ship is a-res not because it is tangible but
because it is a focus of rights that in like manner may
be dealt with by the law. It is no more a res than a copyright. How far in fact the admiralty has carried its proceeding in rem is a question of tradition. We are not
disposed to disturb what we take to have been the understanding of the Circuit Courts for a good many years,
and what the District Court assumed. American Steel
Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal Agency Co., 115
Fed. 669; Bank of British North America v. Freights of
the Hutton, 137 Fed. 534, 538; Larsen v. 150 Bales of
Sisal Grass, 147 Fed. 783, 785; Freights of the Kate, 63
Fed. 707.
But if it be conceded that the Admiralty Court has
jurisdiction to enforce a lien on sub-freights by a proceeding in rem, and a libel is filed alleging such sub-freights

to be outstanding, we do not perceive how the Court can
be deprived of jurisdiction merely by an answer denying
that such freights are due. The jurisdiction is determined by the allegations of the libel. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Rice, 247 U. S. 201, 203. It may be
defeated upon the trial by proof that res does not exist.
But the allegation of facts that if true make out a case
entitles the party making them to have the facts tried.
It is said that the Court derives its jurisdiction from its
power, and no doubt its jurisdiction ultimately depends
on that. But the jurisdiction begins before actual seizure, and authorizes a warrant to arrest, which may or may
not be successful. Here the debtor is within the power
of the Court and therefore the debt, if there is one, is also
within it. The Court has the same jurisdiction to try
the existence of the debt that it has to try the claim of
the libellant for the hire of the Mount Shasta. If the
proof that there is freight due shall fail it does not matter
very much whether it be called proof that the Court had
no jurisdiction or proof that the plaintiff had no case.
Either way the libel will be dismissed. See IraM.Hedges,
218 U. S. 264, 270; Lamar v. United States, 240 U. S.
60, 64.
Decree reversed.
The separate opinion of Mr. JvsUcI

MCREYNOLDS.

I am unable to accept the view that an admiralty court
may entertain an action in rem when there is nothing
which the marshal can take into custody. The technical
term in rem is used to designate a proceeding against
some thing. This court and text writers again and again
have pointed out the essential nature of such thing. The
jurisdiction is founded upon physical power over a res
within the district upon the theory that it is " a contracting or offending entity," a "debtor " or " offending

thing," something that can be arrested or taken into custody, or which can be fairly designated as tangible property. The Sabine, 101 U. S. 384, 388; The Robert W.
Parsons,191 U. S.17, 37; Benedict on Admiralty, 5th ed.,
§§ 11, 297; Hughes on Admiralty, 2d ed., 400, 401; Admiralty Rules 10, 22.
Here the thing supposed to be within the district and
proceeded against was an unliquidated, uncertain and
disputed claim for freight, which manifestly could not be
arrested or taken into custody. To base jurisdiction for
an action in rem upon this intangible claim would amount
to a denial of the essential nature of the proceeding.
Of course, jurisdiction of an admiralty court-that is,
power to hear and adjudge the issues, not merely to send
out a monition-is not finally to be determined by mere
allegations of the libel any more than jurisdiction of a
court of law ultimately depends upon the plaintiff's
allegation that the defendant is alive and within the district. If it appear that the defendant has never been
there or was dead when the action began, certainly the
court can go no further.
An examination of Freights of the Kate, 63 Fed. 707;
American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal
Agency Co., 115 Fed. 669; Bank of British North America v. Freights of the Hutton, 137 Fed. 534, 538; and
Larsen v. 150 Bales of Sisal Grass, 147 Fed. 783, 785, I
think, will fail to disclose any adequate support for the
theory repudiated by the court below. Some language
of American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal
Agency Co., taken alone, seems to favor that view; but,
in fact, the libel there was against " the cargo of coal"
"and the freight on said cargo of coal." The prayer
asked for process against "said cargo of coal and against
said sub-freight thereon," and "that said cargo may be
ordered by the court to be sold and the proceeds thereof
applied to said payment."
The decree below should be affirmed.
