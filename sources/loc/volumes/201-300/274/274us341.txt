Statement of the Case.

Court from a lower federal court. We have, therefore,
the power to correct errors committed below although
objection was not taken there. That power has been repeatedly exercised in criminal cases. See Wiborg v.
United States, 163 U. S. 632, 658-660; Clyatt v. United
States, 197 U. S. 207, 221-222. This case, I think, warrants its exercise.
The judgment should be reversed.

No. 531.

Argued March 3, 1927.-Decided May 16, 1927.

1. A claim for just compensation for the use of property taken by
the Government is "founded upon the Constitution," within the
meaning of Jud. Code, § 145. P. 343.
2. A claim for just compensation for property taken for public use
by officers or agents of the United States pursuant to an Act of
Congress, is a claim founded upon an implied contract. Jud. Code,

§ 145. P. 343.
3. Where the use of private property is taken by eminent domain
and paid for later, the owner is entitled to the value at the time
of taking and such additional amount that the whole may be
equivalent to the value of such use at the time of the taking paid
*contemporaneously with the taking. P. 344.
4. Such additional allowance may be measured by a reasonable rate
of interest, but is not properly interest, and is not within the prohibition of interest before judgment found in Jud. Code, § 177.

Opinion of the Court.

274 U. S.

Mr. Harold S. Deming, with whom Mr. L. Russell
Alden was on the brief, for petitioner.
Assistant Attorney General Galloway, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell was on the brief, for the United
States, did not oppose the issuance of the writ, and submitted the case with some doubt as to the soundness of the
result below.
Messrs. Ira Jewell Williams, John H. Stone, F. R.
Foraker,Charles L. Guerin, and Ira Jewell Williams, Jr.,
filed a brief as iamici curiae,by special leave of Court.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Plaintiffs were partners doing business as Phelps
Brothers and Company; the petitioner is the survivor.
They owned a lease on Pier No. 7 of the Bush Terminal
in New York Harbor. December 31, 1917, pursuant to
an Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645, and
an Act of August 10, 1917, § 10, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279,
the Secretary of War by direction of the President requisitioned that pier and other portions of the Bush Terminal for use in carrying on the war. Plaintiffs vacated,
and the United States took possession of the property and
continued to occupy it until May 14, 1919. The Secretary's order stated that steps would be taken to ascertain
fair compensation for the temporary use of the property;
and a board of appraisers was created for that purpose.
The plaintiffs continued to pay rent to the lessor; and,
in accordance with the finding of the board, the amount
of such payments, $79,890.42, was repaid to plaintiffs by
the United States. The board also found the value per
month of the use of the plaintiffs' property less the
monthly rents paid. The amount calculated on that
basis was not satisfactory to plaintiffs; they elected to
take 75 per cent. of the award and there was paid them

Opinion of the Court.

$44,733.79 on account. They sued to recover an amount
sufficient to make up just compensation. The court
found the value per day of the use of their property; the
amount calculated on that basis was $254,175.79 over and
above the sums paid; and that amount was included in
the judgment entered March 8, 1926. Petitioner was
granted a, writ of certiorari. 273 U. S. 678.
He contends that there should be added such sums as
will produce the equivalent of the value of the use of the
leased property paid contemporaneously; and that interest at a reasonable rate from the date of the use to the
time of payment is a good measure of the amount to be
added in order to make just compensation.
This action was brought under § 145 of the Judicial
Code. That section gives to the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine "all claims (except for
pensions) founded upon the Constitution of the United
States or . . . upon any contract, express or implied,
with the Government of the United States
Section 177 provides that no interest shall be allowed on
any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment
unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for its payment. Under the Fifth Amendment plaintiffs were entitled to just compensation; and, within the meaning of
§ 145, the claim is one founded on the Constitution.
Moreover, it has long been established that, where pursuant to an Act of Congress private property is taken for
public use by officers or agents of the United States, the
Government is under an implied obligation to make just
compensation. That implication being consistent with
the constitutional duty of the Government as well as with
common justice, the owner's claim is one arising out of
implied contract. United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656; Duckett v. United
States, 266 U. S. 149, 151; Campbell v. United States,
