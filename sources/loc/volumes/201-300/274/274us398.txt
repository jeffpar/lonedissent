UNITED STATES v. S. S. WHITE DENTAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 291. Argued April 22, 1927.-Decided May 16, 1927.
1. Under ยง 234 of the Revenue Act of 1918 which authorizes the

deduction from gross income in the computation of income taxes of
"Losses sustained during the taxable year not compensated by
insurance or otherwise," and Treasury regulations providing that
losses deducted "must usually be evidenced by closed or completed
transactions," but specifically authorizing deduction of worthless
debts and corporate stock, the American creditor, and owner of the
stock, of a corporation in Germany, was entitled to deduct the
entire amount of such investment from gross income when the
assets and business of the corporation were sequestered by the
German Government during the war. P. 400.
2. Such sequestration of enemy property was within the rights of
the German Government as a belligerant power and when effected
left the corporation without right to demand its release or compensation for its seizure, at least until the declaration of peace.
P. 402.
3. The transaction-the sequestration-causing the loss was "closed
and completed" when the seizure was made, and the loss was then
deductible although later the German Government bound itself to
repay and an award was made by the Mixed Claims Commission
which may result in recovery. P. 403.
61 Ct. Cls. 143, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STOwE, delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court
of Claims, ยง -240, ยง 3 (b) Jud. Code, as amended, to review a judgment of that court allowing recovery by respondent of income taxes paid for the year 1918. The sole
question presented is the right of the respondent, upheld
below, to deduct from its gross income for 1918, the
amount of its investment in a subsidiary German corporation whose entire property was seized in that year
by the German government as enemy property.
Respondent is a Pennsylvania corporation, engaged in
the manufacture and sale of dental supplies. Before 1918
it had organized and controlled, by ownership of all the
capital stock, the S. S. White Dental Manufacturing
Company, m. b. h. of Berlin, Germany, a German corporation. Its investment in the German corporation in
1918, as carried on its books, aggregated more than
$130,000.
The agreed statement of facts adopted as findings by
the court below are so vague as to leave it uncertain
whether this investment was represented on the books
of respondent by the capital stock alone, or in part by
the capital stock and in part by an open account between
it and the German corporation. The case was argued on
the assumption, which we make, that the investment was
represented by both the capital stock and an open account, due to respondent from the German company.
The total is conceded to be no more than the fair value
of the net assets of the German corporation.
In March, 1918, the sequestrator appointed by the
German government took over the property of the German corporation and the management of its business.
It is inferable from the findings, as the government concedes, that the sequestration was similar in purpose and
legal effect to that authorized under the Trading with
the Enemy Act of the United States, Oct. 6, 1917, c. 106,

11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35; June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat.

c. 252, 44 Stat. 406, and we shall deal with the case on
that basis.
In March, 1920, the possession of the seized assets and
business was relinquished to the German corporation by
the sequestrator. As a result of the mismanagement of
its affairs while in his custody, and investments of its
funds by him in German war loans, the value of its assets
was seriously impaired. In 1922 its tangible assets and
its lease were sold for $6,000. This sum was included in
respondent's income tax return for that year. Later respondent filed a claim with the Mixed Claims Commission which was allowed in 1924 to the extent of $70,000.
What if anything may ultimately be realized from this
award remains uncertain.
In 1918 the respondent charged off as a loss the entire
amount of its investment in the German corporation as
shown by its books, and in July of that year passed a
resolution authorizing the establishment of a reserve
against this loss at the rate of $15,000 quarterly, beginning March, 1918. In making its income tax return for
1918 respondent deducted from gross income the amount
of its investment in the German corporation. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on the sole ground that the loss was not evidenced
by a closed and completed transaction in the year for
which it was deducted. The tax so assessed was paid
under protest and this suit followed.
Section 234 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat.
1057, 1077, 1078, authorizes the deduction in the computation of income taxes of "Losses sustained during the
taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or
otherwise; ". In explaining this section, Article 141 of
Treasury Regulations, 45, provides that losses incurred in

U. S. v. WHITE DENTAL CO.
398

Opinion of the Court.

the taxpayer's trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit may be deducted but such losses
"must usually be evidenced by closed and completed
transactions." Article 151 provides in part: "Where all
the surrounding and attendant circumstances indicate
that a debt is worthless and uncollectible and that legal
action to enforce payment would in all probability not
result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a
showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the
worthlessness of the debt for the purpose of deduction."
And Art. 144 reads in part: "if stock of a corporation
becomes worthless, its cost or its fair market value as of
March 1, 1913, if acquired prior thereto, may be deducted
by the owner in the taxable year in which the stock became worthless, provided a satisfactory showing of its
worthlessness be made as in the case of bad debts." See
Art. 561, making these provisions applicable to corporations.
The case turns upon the question whether the loss,
concededly sustained by the respondent through the
seizure of the assets of the German company in 1918.
was so evidenced by a closed transaction" within the
meaning of the quoted statute and treasury regulations
as to authorize its deduction from gross income of that
year. The statute obviously does not contemplate and
the regulations (Art. 144) forbid the deduction of losses
resulting from the mere fluctuation in value of property
owned by the taxpayer. New York Ins. Co. v. Edwards,
271 U. S. 109, 116; cf. Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., 259
U. S. 247. But with equal certainty they do contemplate
the deduction from gross income of losses, which are fixed
by identifiable events, such as the sale of property (Art.
141, 144), or caused by its destruction or physical injury
(Art. 141, 142, 143) or, in the case of debts, by the occurrence of such events as prevent their collection (Art. 151).

Opinion of the Court.

274 U. S.

The transaction evidencing the loss here was the seizure of the property of the German company. The loss
resulted to the respondent because it was a creditor and
stockholder of that company which, as a result of the
sequestration, was left without property or assets of any
kind. The sequestration of enemy property was within
the rights of the German government as a belligerent
power and when effected left the corporation without
right to demand its release or compensation for its seizure, at least until the declaration of peace. See Littlejohn & Co. v. United States, 270 U. S. 215; White v.
Mechanics Securities Corp., 269 U. S. 283, 300, 301;
Swiss Insurance Co. v. Miller, 267 U. S. 42; Stoehr v.
Wallace, 255 U. S. 239, 242-244; Central Trust Co. v.
Garvan, 254 U. S. 554; Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch.
110, 122. What would ultimately come back to it, as the
event proved, might be secured not as a matter of right,
but as a matter either of grace to the vanquished or
exaction by the victor. In any case the amount realized
would be dependent upon the hazards of the war then
in progress.
That legal action by respondent upon its open accounts
against a corporation thus despoiled would have been
fruitless within the meaning of Art. 151 seems not open
to question. No distinction is urged by the government
between respondent's investment in the stock of the German company and in its open accounts. It is equally
apparent that the stock after the seizure was as worthless
as the obligations of the German company and was deductible under Art. 144 on the same basis as bad
debts.
If the seized -ssets are viewed as the property of respondent, ignoring the entity of the German company,
the result is the same. The quoted regulations, consistently with the statute, contemplate that a loss may
become complete enough for deduction without the tax-
