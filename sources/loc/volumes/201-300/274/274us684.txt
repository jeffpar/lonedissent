one ferry as to the other. We perceive no ground for
holding that relief from such a deviation may not be had
in a suit in equity. No case brought to our attention so
holds. Certainly Watson v. Turnbull, 34 La. An. 856,
cited by the town, does not do so.
The complainant's objection to the court's designation
appears meritorious at first, but it is otherwise when consideration is given to the settled rule in Louisiana that
the banks of navigable streams are subject to a servitude
permitting their use for public purposes including those
incident to navigation, and that "Riparian proprietors
have no right to appropriate to their exclusive use these
banks, and they have no private property in the use
thereof, which is public." Rev. Civ. Code, articles 455,
457, 665; Watson v. Turnbull, supra. This servitude has
existed in Louisiana since before the creation of the State
and has been recognized by this Court and held consistent
with the Fourteenth Amendment. Eldridge v. Trezevant,
160 U. S. 452. Thus the complainant's ownership of the
adjacent lots does not entitle him to be preferred over
others in the use of the bank as a landing place. Nor
does his prior use entitle him to have the other ferry
excluded; for the evidence indicates that there is sufficient room on the two sides of Concordia street for both.
And so far as appears the ramp constructed by him still
may be used in going to and from his docks. In these
circumstances we think the court's designation of the
landing places should not be disturbed.
Decree affirmed.

matter, is treated after removal as a suit in equity, results in an
equitable decree, and is appealed by both parties as equitable, it
is reviewable as such, upon the assignments of error, and the
statutory rule limiting the scope of review in jury-waived cases at
law is not applicable. P. 688.
2. It is error to treat such a suit in the appellate court as one at
law and affirm the decree without considering the assignments of
error. P. 692.
3. The objection that the suit is not within the equity jurisdiction,
whether taken in the trial court or the appellate court, does not
go to the power of the court as a federal court. P. 690.
4. While ordinarily one out of possession may not bring in a federal
court a bill to quiet title, against one in possession, because there
is a full, adequate and complete remedy at law and the defendant
is entitled to a jury trial, the suit is nevertheless within the jurisdiction-i. e., the power-of the federal court sitting in equity,
and the objection of lack of equity jurisdiction may be waived.

the District Court for eastern Oklahoma. The case had
been heard by the trial court on the evidence as a suit in
equity; and had been treated as such in both courts by
both parties. The Court of Appeals concluded that the
trial court did not have jurisdiction in equity; ruled, of
its own motion, that the case must be deemed to have
been tried below as one at law on an oral waiver of jury;
and that, since there had been no waiver filed with the
clerk as provided in ยง 649 of the Revised Statutes and
no bill of exceptions or special findings of fact as provided in ยง 700, the appellate court could not consider the
errors assigned by the parties. It, therefore, affirmed the
judgment on the pleadings. 6 F. (2d) 347,349. Whether
the Court of Appeals erred in so ruling is the only question requiring decision.'
In 1917 the Prairie Oil and Gas Company acquired by
assignment an oil and gas lease, together with an extension thereof, and entered into possession of the land
covered thereby. The lessor was William G. Twist, a
citizen of the Cherokee Nation to whom the land had
been allotted. After Twist's death and the expiration of
the original lease, his children brought this suit in a state
court of Oklahoma seeking relief on the ground that the
extension was invalid because of fraud and also because
certain statutory requirements had not been observed.
Two causes of action were therein set forth. In one,
damages were sought as for an alleged trespass. In the
other, it was charged that the purported extension of the
lease constitutes a cloud upon plaintiff's title; and the
plaintiffs prayed for a declaration as to the ownership,
for cancellation of the extension, for quieting of plaintiffs' title, and for an injunction against further trespass
"In No. 302 four cases, each concerning a different lease, were
consolidated. The facts stated in the opinion are those of one of
these. The same question is presented in No. 301 concerning a fifth
lease.

or claim by defendant. Such joinder in a single suit of
a cause of action at law with one in equity is permissible
under the Oklahoma statute; and under the state law a
suit to quiet title may apparently be brought by one out
of possession against one in possession. Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921, c. 3, Art. XIV.
The Company, the defendant below, removed the case
to the federal court for eastern Oklahoma on the ground
of diversity of citizenship. In the federal court the
joinder of an action at law with one in equity is not
allowable. Hurt v. Hollingsworth, 100 U. S. 100; Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas Ry. Co., 135 U. S. 641,
651. Unless the first cause of action stated in the bill
could have been construed as asking an accounting incidental to the equitable relief asked, the pleading should
have been recast so as to separate the action at law from
the suit in equity and each case should have proceeded
separately according to its nature. Compare Hatcher v.
Hendr&ie & Bolthofi Mfg. & Supply Co., 133 Fed. 267,
271; Knoxville v. Southern Paving Co., 220 Fed. 236, 238.
Neither party sought to have this done. The defendant
caused the case to be docketed as a case in equity; and
filed a single answer to both causes of action. Therein,
it objected that the petition did not state facts sufficient
in law or in equity, to entitle the plaintiff to the relief
prayed for, or to any relief; and then, taking up the several allegations of the petition, admitted some, denied
others, and set up new matter. The answer prays that
the petition be dismissed for want of equity; but also
asks affirmative relief. It prays "that the court, by its
decree, declare and determine that the defendant's title
to said oil and gas lease, as modified and extended, is
good, valid and subsisting as against the claim of the
plaintiff, and that its title thereto be quieted as against
said claims." A reply to the new matter was filed by
plaintiffs.

Opinion of the Court.

274 U. S.

The proceedings on the appeals were throughout those
customary in an equity cause. The records were full
and complete. They include, among other things, all of
the evidence. The decree declared that the defendant is
the owner of the extended oil and gas lease covering
eleven-fifteenths interest in the described lands; that two
of th plaintiffs are the owners of the remaining fourfifteenths interest; that these two plaintiffs recover fourfifteenths "of the net proceeds of the oil and gas produced
from said land from September 29, 1919 to April 1, 1923"
(the amount of which was agreed upon); and that "the
amount produced since April 1st, 1923 [be] reserved for
further consideration." Both the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Neither party assigned as error that there was lack of
jurisdiction in equity or a lack of equity. The errors assigned disclosed claims that the District Court erred in
admitting evidence; in excluding evidence; in refusing to
set aside the extension; in making certain findings; in
making certain rulings; in decreeing that the defendant
was the owner of the eleven-fifteenths interest in the
extended lease; in decreeing that two of the plaintiffs
were the owners of four-fifteenths; in concluding that the
extension of the lease held by the defendant constituted a
cloud upon the title of these two and in decreeing the
removal of that cloud; in concluding that they were entitled to two-fifteenths of the net proceeds and in ordering payment of the agreed amount.
The Court of Appeals held that it was without power
to review the case as upon an appeal from an equity
cause, or to consider any of the errors assigned. Because
in its opinion there was a plain, adequate and complete
remedy at law, it held that the case must be deemed to
have been tried in the District Court as an action at law
without a jury. And it applied the rule, that where an
action at law is tried without a jury and there has been

TWIST v. PRAIRIE OIL CO.

Opinion of the Court.

no waiver of the jury in the manner prescribed by the
statute and no special findings or bill of exceptions, the
appellate court is without power to review any question
except those which arise on the process, pleadings or
judgment. See Law v. United States, 266 U. S. 494;
United States v. Archibald McNeil & Sons, 267 U. S. 302;
FleischmannConstructionCo. v. United States, 270 U. S.
349, 356; Cleveland v. Walsh Construction Co., 279 Fed.
57. The statutory rule limiting the scope of review by
an appellate court in jury-waived cases was not applicable to the case at bar. This is not an action at law.
In federal courts, as in others, a plaintiff has a right to
choose whether he will seek to enforce a legal or an equitable cause of action and whether he will seek legal or
equitable relief. He makes his election and proceeds at
law or in equity at his peril. See Perego v. Dodge, 163
U. S. 160, 164. Formerly, if a plaintiff in a federal court
sued in equity and the objection that there was a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law was sustained, the
bill was necessarily dismissed. Curriden v. Middleton,
232 U. S. 633. And ordinarily the dismissal was required
to be without prejudice to an action at law, Horsburg v.
Baker, 1 Pet. 232, 237; Thompson v. Railroad Companies,
6 Wall. 134, 139; Van Norden v. Morton, 99 U. S. 378,
382; Rogers v. Durant, 106 U. S. 644; Scott v. Neely, 140
U. S. 106, 117; Lacassagnev. Chapuis, 144 U. S. 119, 126;
though possibly such precaufion was unnecessary. Ash
Sheep Co. v. United Stlates, 252 U. S. 159, 170. Now,
under the Act of March 3, 1915, c. 90, ยง 274 a, 38 Stat. 956
and Equity Rules 22 and 23, if the suit was improperly
brought in equity, either the trial court or the appellate
court may transfer the case to the- law side. Compare
Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Bank, 260 U. S. 235, 241-243;
Pierce v. NationalBank of Commerce, 268 Fed. 487, 489;
Equitable Trust Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co.,
250 Fed. 327, 340. The practice is the same in suits re55514o-28--44

moved from a state court, except that the suit is remanded
to the state court where the equitable relief sought, although beyond the equitable jurisdiction of the federal
court, may be granted by the state court. Compare Cates
v. Allen, 149 U. S. 451; Knoxville v. Southern Paving Co.,
220 Fed. 236, 237.
The parties cannot, of course, compel the trial court
to hear in equity a suit which seeks a legal remedy for
a legal cause of action. Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 446.
Nor can the task of reviewing such a case as if it were actually an equity cause be imposed upon the appellate
court through consent of the parties. See Elkhart Carriage & Motor Car Co. v. Partin,9 F. (2d) 393. Either
the trial court or the appellate may, of its own motion,
take the objection that the case is not within the equity
jurisdiction. Compare Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S. 354,
395. But that objection, whether taken in the trial court
or in the appellate court, does not go to the power of the
court as a federal court.
The decree in the case at bar rests upon the second
cause of action set forth in the bill and the answer
thereto. We must disregard, as the lower court and the
parties did, the first cause of action. The features of the
second cause of action are all those of a bill to remove
a cloud and to quiet title. The bill prays for a declaration of the rights of the respective parties; for the cancellation of an agreement; for an injunction against the
assertion of certain rights; and for general relief. The
answer embodied what is in effect a cross-bill. The relief
sought by the bill and the cross-bill is of a character
within the recognized sphere of federal equity jurisdiction. See United States v. Wilson, 118 U. S. 86. The
recovery, as upon an accounting, of the agreed amount
of the net profits was a normal incident of such a bill.

TWIST v. PRAIRIE OIL CO.
684

Opinion of the Court.

Clarke v. White, 12 Pet. 178, 187-188; Southern Pacific
Co. v. United States, 200 U. S. 341. Compare The Salton
Sea Cases, 172 Fed. 792, 799-802; Chicago, M. & St. P.
Ry. Co. v. United States, 218 Fed. 288, 301-302. It may
be that the bill was fatally defective. But the proceeding was unmistakably a suit in equity. The plaintiffs
attempted to state a cause of action cognizable by a court
of equity. They sought equitable relief.
It is true that ordinarily one out of possession may not
bring in a federal court a bill to quiet title, against one
in possession, because there is a full, adequate and complete remedy at law and the defendant is entitled to a
jury trial. See Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U. S. 146;
Black v. Jackson, 177 U. S. 349, 363-364; Lancaster v.
Kathleen Oil Co., 241 U. S. 551, 555. But the suit is of
a class within the jurisdiction-that is the power--of a
federal court sitting in equity. There are cases in the
federal courts in which suits in equity to quiet title
brought by one out of possession against one in possession have been entertained, because of the special facts,
or because of the particular relief sought, or because the
defendant waived the objection of lack of equity jurisdiction. Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, 142 U. S.
417; Schroeder v. Young, 161 U. S. 334, 345. Compare
Stewart v. Masterson, 131 U. S. 151; Duignan v. United
States, ante, p. 195; Jones v. PrairieOil & Gas Co., 273
U. S. 195; Kilgore v. Norman, 119 Fed. 1006, aff'd 120
Fed. 1020; Big Six Co. v. Mitchell, 138 Fed. 279; Continental Trust Co. v. Tallassee, etc. Co., 222 Fed. 694, 702.
Such waiver is possible, because the objection that the bill
does not make a case within the equity jurisdiction of a
federal court goes not to the power of the court as a federal court, but to the merits. Blythe v. Hinckley, 173
U. S. 501; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261 U. S. 491,

500. Compare Burnrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs,
ante, p. 208; Duignan v. United States, supra.
The Court of Appeals, being of opinion that the plaintiffs had not established a right to relief in equity, because
there was a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law,
might, on the undisputed facts, have reversed the decree
on that ground without considering the specific errors
assigned; and, rightly or wrongly, it might have ordered
the bill dismissed without prejudice to the remedy at
law; or might conceivably have ordered the case transferred to the law docket; or might have considered the
case on the merits as on an equity appeal, in the view
that at such stage of the proceedings it was desirable to
hold that the objection to the equity jurisdiction had been
waived. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. United States,
200 U. S. 341. But it could not, while refusing to consider the errors assigned, retain the case and adjudicate
the merits. This it did when it affirmed the decree. It
was error to declare that this proceeding, which is a bill
in equity in its nature as well as in its form, and which
seeks relief that only a court of equity can give, Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co., 241 U. S. 551, 555, shall be
deemed an action at law, because the only remedy open
to the plaintiffs was at law. Compare Spring Garden
Insurance Co. v. Amusement Syndicate Co., 178 Fed. 519,
530. The suit at bar is not like Elkhart Carriage &
Motor Car Co. v. Partin,9 F. (2d) 393, an action at law
masquerading as a suit in equity.
Because the Court of Appeals should have considered
the errors assigned as in an equity cause but did not, we
reverse its judgment and remand the case to it for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. See
Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, 260 U. S. 235,
245.
