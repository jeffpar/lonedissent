Syllabus.

While we cannot take jurisdiction on the writ of error
so improvidently allowed, we can, under § 237(c) of the
Judicial Code, treat the papers whereon the writ was
allowed as a petition for certiorari and as if presented to
this Court at the time they were presented to the judge
who allowed the writ. The papers have been examined
under that section; and we are of opinion that, treating
them as a petition for certiorari, they disclose a. case and

situation in which the petition should be granted.
Writ of error as such dismissed, but as petition for

MAUL v. UNITED STATES.1
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 655. Argued January 19, 20, 1927.-Decided May 31, 1927.
1. Officers of the Coast Guard are authorized, by virtue of Rev. Stats.
§ 3072, to seize on the high seas more than 12 miles from the coast
an American vessel subject to forfeiture for violation of the revenue
laws. Pp. 503, 512.
2. Section 3072 of the Revised Statutes, providing that "It shall be
the duty of the several officers of the customs to seize and secure
any vessel or merchandise which shall become liable to seizure by
virtue of any law respecting the revenue, as well without as within
their respective districts," was not affected by the first paragraph
of § 581 of the Act of September 21, 1922, which provides primarily for boarding and searching vessels "at any place in the
United States or within four leagues of the coast," to discover and
prevent intended smuggling, and secondarily for prompt seizure of
the vessel by the searching officer if the search disclose a violation
of the law which subjects her to forfeiture. P. 505.
3. In construing altered revenue laws the whole system must be regarded in each alteration, and no disturbance allowed of existing
legislative rules of general application beyond the clear intention of
Congress. P. 508.
4. Sections 4337 and 4377 of the Revised Statutes, which subject to
forfeiture any vessel, enrolled or licensed in the coastwise trade,

which shall proceed upon a foreign voyage without giving up her
enrollment or license and without being duly registered, and any
licensed vessel employed in trade other than that for which she
was licensed, are directed to the protection of the revenue, (besides
being regulations of commerce,) and therefore come within the
term "law respecting the revenue" as used in § 3072, supra.
P. 508.
5. Officers of the Coast Guard are "officers of the customs," having
"districts" within the meaning of Rev. Stats. § 3072, and are
authorized to make seizures thereunder. P. 509.
6. The provision of Rev. Stats. § 3072, for seizures by officers of the
customs "as well without as within their respective districts," is to
be construed as respects domestic vessels to include the sea outside
of customs districts. P. 510.
7. Congress has power to authorize seizure of domestic vessels on the
high sea for violation of the revenue laws. P. 511.

CERTIORARI (273 U. S. 684) to a decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals reversing one by the District Court,
6 F. (2d) 937, which dismissed a libel for the forfeiture
of a domestic vessel charged with violations of the revenue
laws. The ground of the dismissal was that the seizure of
the vessel more than twelve miles from the coast, and by
officers of the Coast Guard, was unwarranted by law, and
that the District Court was therefore without jurisdiction.

and Louis Halle were on the brief, for petitioner.

Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. A. W. Henderson,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, were on the
brief, for the United States.

This is a libel of information for the forfeiture of the

for the coastwise trade. Five causes of forfeiture are set

forth. One is that, in violation of § 4377 of the Revised
Statutes, the vessel was employed in a trade other than
that for which she was licensed. Another is that, in
violation of § 4337 of the Revised Statutes, the vessel
proceeded from the United States on a foreign voyage
without giving up her enrolment and license and without
being duly registered. The others are not now insisted
on.
In December, 1924, officers of the Coast Guard seized
the vessel on the high seas, thirty-four miles from the
coast, and turned her over to the collector of customs
at New London, Connecticut, whereupon the libel was
filed and the vessel arrested.
The case was heard on an agreed statement of facts
and an exception by the claimant, Maul, to the court's
jurisdiction. The exception was sustained on the theory
that the officers of the Coast Guard were without authority to seize the vessel at sea more than twelve miles from
the coast, and a decree dismissing the libel was entered.

exception untenable, sustained the two causes of forfeiture before stated, and accordingly reversed the decree.
13 Fed. (2d) 433. The claimant petitioned for a review by this Court on certiorari and the petition was
granted.
The claimant does not question here that the agreed facts establish the two causes of forfeiture, but does insist
that the seizure was made without authority, and particularly that officers of the Coast Guard were not authorized
to make such a seizure on the high seas more than twelve
miles from the coast. The question has several phases
which will be considered.
It is well to bear in mind that the case neither involves
the seizure of a foreign vessel nor an exercise of asserted
authority to board and search a vessel, domestic or foreign, for the purpose of detecting and thwarting i-

tended smuggling. The seizure was of an American vessel, then on the high seas and more than twelve miles
from the coast, which had become "liable to seizure and
forfeiture" by reason of definite and accomplished violations of the law under which she was enrolled and
licensed.

Section 45 of the Judicial Code declares: "Proceedings
on seizures made on the high seas, for forfeiture under any
law of the United States, may be prosecuted in any dis-

trict into which the property so seized is brought and
proceedings instituted." This provision originated with
the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, § 9, 1 Stat. 73, has
remained in force ever since, § 734 Rev. Stats., and plainly
recognizes that seizures for forfeitures may be made on
the high seas. See The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, 401-402;
The Abby, 1 Fed. Cas. p. 26. True, it does not indicate
how or by whom the seizures may be effected; but other
provisions speak to the point. There is need to trace
them from the beginning; and in doing so it should be
in mind that officers of the Coast Guard are to be deemed
customs officers, a matter which will be explained later
on.
The Act of July 31, 1789, c. 5, 1 Stat. 29, regulating
the collection of duties on the tonnage of vessels and on
the importation of merchandise, contained several provisions declaring that vessels violating its provisions should
be liable to seizure and forfeiture, and also a section (26)
authorizing customs officers "to make seizure of and
secure any ship or vessel, goods, or merchandise, which
shall be liable to seizure by virtue of this Act, as
well without as within their respective districts." That
Act was repealed by the Act of August 4, 1790,
c. 35, 1 Stat. 145, which enlarged the prior regulations and contained a section (50) giving customs officers the same authority to make seizures that was given

MAUL v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

before. Next came the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1
Stat. 627, which again enlarged the regulations and contained a section (70) respecting seizures which was like
that in the prior acts. This last provision is now § 3072
of the Revised Statutes and reads as follows:
"It shall be the duty of the several officers of the customs to seize and secure any vessel or merchandise which
shall become liable to seizure by virtue of any law respecting the revenue, as well without as within their
respective districts."
Along with the provision thus carefully preserved, the
several acts contained other provisions distinct from it
which authorized customs officers to board and search
vessels bound to the United States and to inspect their
manifests, examine their cargoes, and prevent any unlading while they were coming in. A supplemental Act of
July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178, enlarged that provision
by declaring that, if it appeared to the officer making
the search that there had been a violation of the laws of
the United States whereby the vessel or any merchandise
thereon was liable to .forfeiture, he should make seizure
of the same. The provision so enlarged became § 3059 of
the Revised Statutes. In the early acts the authority to
board and search was limited, not only to vessels -bound
to the United States, but to such as were within the territorial waters of the United States or within four leagues
(twelve miles) of the coast. But in the Act of 1866 and
in § 3059 of the Revised Statutes the words expressing
these restrictions were omitted. Possibly the omission
was not significant, for the same restrictions were expressed in § 3067 of the Revised Statutes which related
to the boarding and searching of vessels.
The Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858,
979, 989, repealed §§ 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes and enacted a provision dealing with the same subject
and reading as follows:

506

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

274 U. S.

"SEc. 581. BOARDING VESSELS. Officers of the customs or of the Coast Guard, and agents or other persons
authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or appointed
for that purpose in writing by a collector may at any time
go on board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the
United States or within four leagues of the coast of the
United States, without as well as within their respective
districts, to examine the manifest and to inspect, search,
and examine the vessel or vehicle, and every part thereof,
and any person, trunk, or package on board, and to this
end to hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, if under way,
and use all necessary force to compel compliance, and if
it shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of
the United States has been committed, whereby or in
consequence of which such vessel or vehicle, or the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board of or imported
by such vessel or vehicle is liable to forfeiture, it shall be
the duty of such officer to make seizure of the same, and
to arrest, or, in case of escape or attempted escape, to
pursue and arrest any person engaged in such breach or
violation.
"Officers of the Department of Commerce and other
persons authorized by such department may go on board
of any vessel at any place in the United States or within
four leagues of the coast of the United States and hail,
stop, and board such vessels in the enforcement of the
navigation laws and arrest or, in the case of escape or
attempted escape, pursue and arrest any person engaged
in the breach or violation of the navigation laws."
The last paragraph of this provision relates to the apprehension and arrest of individuals violating the navigation laws, not to the seizure of vessels and neither party
bases any contention or argument on it. So it may be
passed as without bearing here.
But the claimant contends and the District Court ruled
that the first paragraph is now the sole source and meas-

MAUL v. UNITED STATES.
501

Opinion of the Court.

ure of the authority of Coast Guard officers to seize vessels, and that, as it provides only for seizure within the
United States or within twelve miles of the coast, a seizure outside these limits is unlawful. The contention is

faulty in that it puts aside § 3072 of the Revised Statutes,
before quoted, which authorizes customs officers to seize
any vessel "liable to seizure by virtue of any law respecting the revenue" and declares, without limiting words,
that this authority may be exercised "as well without as
within their respective districts."
Without doubt the provision in the Act of 1922 is intended to take the place of §§ 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes. It deals with the same subject and is accompanied by an express repeal of those sections. But it
is not accompanied by a repeal of § 3072, and there is
otherwise no reason for thinking it is intended to repeal
or disturb that section. While the new provision and
§ 3072 are closely related and both are directed to the
protection of the revenue, they are distinct, free from
real repugnance, and well may stand together. One provides primarily for boarding and searching vessels, within
prescribed limits, to discover and prevent intended smuggling, and secondarily for the prompt seizure of the vessel by the searching officer if the search discloses a violation of law which subjects her to forfeiture. The other
provides broadly, and without restriction as to place, for
the seizure of vessels which, through violation of the laws
respecting revenue, have become liable to seizure. While
the former restricts the authority to board and search to
particular limits--the territorial waters and the high seas
twelve miles outward from the coast-it does not purport to lay such a restriction on seizures. Where the seizure is incidental to a boarding and search under that provision the presence of the vessel within the prescribed
limits operates to fix the place of seizure. Possibly the
restriction may be said to affect such a seizure, but only

in a limited sense. In other seizures, of which there are
many, the restriction has no bearing and no effect. So
no reason appears for thinking Congress clearly intended
to displace the general and long continued provision in
§ 3072. In this situation effect should be given to the
familiar rule that in construing altered revenue laws "the
whole system must be regarded in each alteration, and
no disturbance allowed of existing legislative rules of general application beyond the clear intention of Congress."

United States, 16 Pet. 342, 363; United States v. Sixtyseven Packages of Dry Goods, 17 How. 85, 93.
Thus far it has been assumed that the seizure came
within the terms of § 3072; but questions are suggested
in this connection which will be noticed.
One question is whether the vessel's liability to seizure
was "by virtue of any law respecting the revenue." The
liability arose from a violation of §§ 4337 and 4377 of
the Revised Statutes-in that the vessel, being enrolled
and licensed for the coastwise trade, proceeded on a foreign voyage without giving up her enrolment and license
and without being duly registered,2 and was employed in
a trade other than that for which she was licensed. The
sections violated are found in a subdivision of the Revised
Statutes entitled "Regulation of Vessels in Domestic
Commerce," but the arrangement of sections in the Revision is without special significance, Rev. Stats. § 5600.
That subdivision includes several provisions designed to
regulate commerce by vessels and also to protect the revenue, these being related subjects. A reading of the sections violated in connection with others in the same sub2 The distinction between being enrolled and licensed and being
registered is that the former is a condition to employment in the
coastwise trade while the latter pertains to' foreign trade.

Opinion of the Court.

division 3 makes it plain that they are directed to the protection of the revenue; and therefore they come within
the terms of § 3072. That they are also regulations of
commerce by vessels does not make them any the less
laws respecting the revenue.
Another question is whether officers of the Coast Guard
are among those whom the section authorizes to make
seizures. It says "officers of the customs" and speaks
of "their respective districts."
By the Act of 1790 '(§§ 62-64) Congress established the
Revenue Cutter Service for the express purpose of protecting the revenue, directed that its expenses be paid
out of duties collected on imported merchandise and on
the tonnage of vessels, and declared that its officers should
"be deemed officers of the customs." By the Act of
1799 (§§ 97-102) these provisions were enlarged and reenacted, collectors of customs were given a power of direction over the service subject to assignments and wide
supervision by the Secretary of the Treasury, and officers
of the service were given authority to hail "vessels liable
to seizure or examination" and to enforce submission.
The enlarged provisions were included in the Revised
Statutes (§§ 2747-2765) and are still in force, save that
in 1915 the Coast Guard became the successor of the
Revenue Cutter Service and took over its personnel, vessels, duties and powers, c. 20, 38 Stat. 800.
The regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time show that it early became the
practice to assign vessels and officers in this service to
particular customs districts and to subject their activities largely to the direction of the collectors of customs.'

And it otherwise appears that this practice became so
settled that the vessels and officers when assigned were
regarded as "belonging" to the particular districts. The
Eliza, 8 Fed. Cas. p. 455; The Friendship, 9 Fed. Cas.
p. 822.
In recent years the number of vessels and the personnel
have been enlarged and provision has been made for
imposing additional duties not requiring special notice
here. The practice of assigning vessels and their officers
to particular customs districts also has been changed to
the extent that now the assignments are of one or more
vessels to coast divisions, including one or more customs
districts.' Otherwise the duties and practice in respect
of the protection of the revenue remain practically as
before.'
It is apparent from this review of the statutes and regulations that Coast Guard officers are to be deemed officers of the customs within the meaning of § 3072, and
also that their connection with particular customs districts-whether one or more-is such that they properly
may be said to have districts in the sense intended by the
term "their respective districts." The term is not peculiar to § 3072. It was applied to Revenue Cutter officers
in § 31 of the Act of 1790, § 54 of the Act of 1799, and
§§ 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes, and is now
applied to Coast Guard officers in § 581 of the Act of 1922.
The remaining question relates to the meaning of the
clause indicating where the officers may seize. It says
"as well without as within their respective districts."
Two constructions are suggested-one restricting the
natural sense and treating the clause as if saying "as
well within other customs districts as within their own ";
and the other accepting the natural sense. The difference

is that one excludes and the other includes the sea outside
customs districts. In actual practice the latter construction has been adopted and it appears to be right. Besides
giving effect to the natural import of the clause, it is better adapted to the attainment of the purpose of the section. If vessels violating the revenue laws and thereby
incurring liability to forfeiture could escape seizure by
departing from or avoiding waters within customs districts the liability to forfeiture would be of little practical
effect in checking violations; and it is most improbable
that Congress intended to leave the avenues of escape
thus unguarded. The terms it has used are easily broad
enough to meet the situation effectively, United States
v. Bowman, 260 U. S. 94, 98-100, and no reason is suggested or perceived for cutting them down as respects
domestic vessels. If Congress were without power to provide for the seizure of such vessels on the high sea, a
restrictive construction might be justified. But there is
no want of power in this regard. The high sea is common
to all nations and foreign to none; and every nation having vessels there has power to regulate them and also to
seize them for a violation of its laws. The Apollon, 9

these distinctions are not involved in this case.
It follows that the seizure in this instance by the officers
of the Coast Guard was lawful and therefore that the
exception to the District Court's jurisdiction was ill
grounded. Whether if the seizure-made by federal officers-were unlawful the ruling in Dodge v. United States,
272 U. S. 530, would apply need not be considered.

MR. JusTIcE BRANDEIS,

concurring.

I concur in the judgment of the Court. But I cannot
agree to the construction of the statutes on which the
decision is rested. The Court holds that the statutes confer upon the Coast Guard express authority to seize on
the high seas beyond the twelve-mile limit an American
vessel which has become liable to forfeiture for violation
of the navigation laws; and the reason assigned is that
these are "laws respecting the revenue" within the
meaning of § 3072 of the Revised Statutes. As I read
the statutes, they do not confer express authority, but
the authority exists because it is to be implied as an incident of the police duties of ocean patrol which Congress
has imposed upon the Coast Guard. Mere difference of
opinion in thC construction of intricate statutes can rarely
justify expression of dissent. This is especially true
where the two views lead, in the particular case, to the
same result. But, in this instance, the construction
adopted by the Court may have in other cases far-reaching and regrettable results.
Enforcement of the " laws respecting the revenue
forms only a part of the oceaii patrol duties imposed by
Congress upon the Coast Guard. And seizure on the
high seas of vessels which have "become liable to seizure" does not exhaust the services required of the Coast

Guard to ensure enforcement there of the laws respecting
the revenue. Unless the Coast Guard has authority to
seize the ship and to arrest persons thereon found violating our laws, no American official is authorized to do so.
If the statutes are construed as granting to the Coast
Guard express authority to make the seizure in question
in order to protect the revenue, the authority so granted
is obviously very narrow, and the express grant may possibly be read as exhausting the authority conferred beyond the twelve-mile limit; in other words, as showing
that no implied authority is conferred. For this reason
it seems to me important to state why I cannot assent to
the view expressed by the Court.
The claimant concedes that, within the United States,
the Coast Guard is charged with the duty of enforcing
our navigation laws, and for this purpose, may board,
search, and seize American vessels there; that our navigation laws govern American merchant vessels on the high
seas; and that the United States could by appropriate
legislation authorize the Coast Guard to seize, without a
warrant, any such vessel violating our law on the high
seas, regardless of distance from our coast. See United
States v. Bowman, 260 U. S. 94, 97; Cunard Steamship
Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100, 125, 129. His contention
apparently is that Congress does not impose upon officers
of the Coast Guard any duty to enforce the navigation
laws on the high seas beyond the twelve-mile limit; and
that, even if it does impose the duty, it has not conferred
authority to enforce compliance by means of a seizure
to be made there. The question for decision is the power
of the Coast Guard to seize American vessels beyond the
twelve-mile limit.'

The Coast Guard is a part of the civil establishment.
It is a bureau of the Treasury Department,' established
by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 20, 38 Stat. 800, in lieu of

Act of 1915 did not add to or abridge in any respect
existing duties and powers of officers of revenue cutters.
It merely transferred to the Coast Guard the duties and
powers theretofore possessed.
When the Revenue Cutter Service was established, its
duties were limited to the protection of the revenues. In
1793, the duty of enforcing also the navigation laws was
imposed.3 Thereafter, from time to time, the duty of
enforcing many other laws relating to transactions involving marine operations was added. Revenue cutters
became thus America's civil ocean patrol.4 But their
service is not limited to enforcing our municipal law.
They have been employed also in protecting the lives
and property of Americans against foreigners in international controversies falling short of war; and they have
served during wars in operations against the enemy.'
Revenue cutters are armed cruisers. Naval discipline,
drill and routine prevail on all the ships. Their officers
are commissioned, and their men enlisted, like officers
and men in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The
Secretary of the Treasury assigns them to a particular
vessel; and the vessel is usually assigned to a particular

Forfeiture of the offending vessel is a punishment commonly prescribed for violation of our navigation laws,
and of many other laws which revenue cutters are required to aid in enforcing. Of these there are many
which are in no way concerned with the collection of
the revenue.2 ' In order to enforce these laws adequately,
it is necessary that some officials of the Government shall

21 Aside from the customs and registry and enrollment acts, referred
to at length in the text, there have been many statutes providing for
the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, or for a penalty which is made
a lien upon the vessel. Some of these statutes confer power of
seizure upon the revenue cutters, either specifically or by reference
to officers of the customs or officers of the revenue; some provide for
seizure by some other means, usually by the navy under the direction
of the President; the majority make no specific provision for seizure.

to make a seizure beyond the twelve-mile limit presents,
therefore, questions affecting the enforcement not only
of the navigation laws, but also of the customs laws, the
National Prohibition Law, and others. If the officers of
revenue cutters were without authority to seize American merchant vessels found violating our laws on the
high seas beyond the twelve-mile limit, or to seize such
vessels found there which are known theretofore to have
violated our laws without or within those limits, many
offenses against our laws might, to that extent, be committed with impunity. For clearly no other arm of the
Government possesses such authority.
The questions presented necessitate enquiry into early
and recent administrative practice, as well as into legislation and judicial decisions. I shall consider first whether
officers of revenue cutters had authority to seize on the
high seas for violation of the navigation laws prior to
18, 1818, a. 70, 3 Stat. 432; Act of May 15, 1820, c. 122, 3 Stat. 602;

the Tariff Act of 1922; then, whether that Act abridged
their authority.
First. The provisions of the navigation laws alleged
to have been violated, have been in force since the beginning of our Government. Act of February 18, 1793, c. 8,
§§ 8, 32, 1 Stat. 305, 308, 316; Rev. Stat. §§ 4337, 4377.
The express authority to board and search in terms beyond the territorial limits of the United States appeared
first in §§ 31 and 64 of the customs-collection Act of
August 4, 1790, c. 35, 1 Stat. 145, 164, 175, which established the Revenue Cutter Service. The authority there
conferred upon it was to board and search within "the
United States or within four leagues [twelve miles] of
the coast." It applied to all vessels--foreign as well as
American; but was limited to inbound vessels. These
sections, which granted power to board and search, contained no express grant of power to seize. Express statutory authority to seize in terms beyond the territorial
limits of the United States for violation of its laws was
not conferred, until the Tariff Act of 1922, in respect to
any offence except in those few instances in which Congress, in pursuance of specific treaties, provided that any
vessel, foreign or American, might be seized 2 We are
concerned here only with the right of the Coast Guard
to seize an American vessel for violation of a law applicable solely to such vessels.
The only express statutory authorization upon which,
prior to the Tariff Act of 1922, a claim of power in any
official to seize a vessel on any waters for violation of the
navigation laws could possibly be predicated were § 27
of the Act of February 18, 1793, c. 8, 1 Stat. 305, 315' (a
navigation law), which was repealed by its omission from

the Revised Statutes; 23 and § 2 of the Act of July 18, 1866,
c. 201, 14 Stat. 178 (a customs-collection law), which was
embodied in § 3059 of the Revised Statutes as 4 part of
"Title XXXIV, Collection of Duties upon Imports; "
and § 3072 of the Revised Statutes, which dealt with
seizures for violation of "any law respecting the revenue." 24 Section 3059 authorized "any officer of the customs, including" those "of a revenue cutter," to "go
on board of any vessel . . . to inspect, search and
examine the same . . .; and if it shall appear that
any breach or violation of the laws of the United States
has been committed, whereby . . . such vessel
. . . is liable to forfeiture, to make seizure of the
same .
The authority which § 3059, § 3072, -nd the earlier
acts, expressly conferred upon all officers "of the customs" was to seize "as well without as within his district." No distinction was there made between foreign
and domestic vessels; nor between inbound and outbound
vessels. The clause appeared first in the Act of July 31,
1789, c. 5, § 26, 1 Stat. 29, 43, the earliest law regulating
the collection of customs. As there used, the clause
clearly meant only that collectors, naval officers and surveyors should have the authority to seize in other districts
of the United States besides the particular ones to which
23

Section 27 was never expressly repealed. In the "Revision of
United States Statutes as Drafted by the Commissioners" (1872),
it appeared as § 620 of Title 36, c. 10. It does not appear in the
Revised Statutes as finally enacted, however, and hence, under § 5596,
must be deemed to have been repealed, because of the omission, since
many other sections of the Act of February 18, 1793, were included
therein. It is in phraseology and substance similar to § 2 of the Act
of July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178.
24 That section also is a re-enactment of identical provisions in
earlier customs collection laws. See Acts of March 2, 1799, c.22,
§ 70, 1 Stat. 627, 678; August 4, 1790, c. 35, § 50, 1 Stat. 145, 170;
July 31, 1789, c.5, § 26, 1 Stat. 29, 43.

they were respectively appointed. For the clause antedated the first express authorization of either search or
seizure without the territorial limits of the United States;
and antedated also the establishment of the Revenue
Cutter Service.25 Did the phrase "without . . . his
district," when used in § 3059, continue to mean within
some other customs collection district of the United
States; or did it acquire the new meaning of anywhere,
even without the territorial waters of the United States?
Compare Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205.
If the former meaning is the true one, there was prior
to the Tariff Act of 1922 no express authority in officers
of revenue cutters to seize for violation of any, law beyond
the territorial limits of the United States. If the latter
meaning is the true one, not only officers of revenue cutters, but also all other customs officers were given by
§ 3059 express authority to seize anywhere on the high
seas any vessel, foreign or American, found violating our
laws. In my opinion the former meaning is clearly the
true one. Congress cannot have intended to confer the
general authority to seize foreign vessels upon the high
seas.2" And the clause in question is used in § 581 of the
Act of 1922 in the same sentence with an express territorial limitation. But it does not follow that American
vessels violating our laws beyond the territorial limits
could not be seized. Authority to seize American vessels
25

See also Alexander Hamilton's Report of February 2, 1795,
American State Papers, Finance, Vol. I, No. 77, pp. 348, 349, urging
the insertion of a similar clause in the statutes dealing with the power
of internal revenue officers, who, of course, operate on land only.
26 It has been commonly asserted that, even under the hovering
laws, a sovereign may not seize a foreign vessel until it enters the
territorial waters. These do not extend beyond the three-mile limit.

there was conferred upon officers of revenue cutters by
implication. They possessed the authority as an incident
of their office of ocean patrol. They are officers of the
branch of the Government charged with the faithful execution of the laws. Wherever on the high seas they
were charged with enforcing compliance with our laws,
there they were, in my opinion, authorized to seize American vessels, regardless of the distance from our coast.
Compare United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 15; United
States v. Tingey, 5 Pet. 115, 126; 28 Op. Atty. Gen. 121,
124, 549, 552.
There is no limitation upon the right of the sovereign
to seize without a warrant vessels registered under its
laws, similar to that imposed by the common law and the
Constitution upon the arrest of persons and upon the
seizure of "papers and effects." 28 See Carroll v. United
27

The power of the ordinary peace officers to arrest and to seize
does not seem to have been conferred originally by statute. As to
the sheriff, statutes dealt with the method of appointment, tenure of
office, and qualifications, but not with the extent of his powers. See

1 Blackstone Comm., 339-346; Dalton, Sheriff, passim.; Watson,
Sheriff, c. I, c. III. Similarly as to constables and watchmen. See
4 Blackstone Comm., 292. These powers, including of course the
power to arrest, are in this country thought to inhere in these offices,
except in so far as they may be limited by statute. See South v.

States, 267 U. S. 132, 151-153. Smuggling is commonly
attended by violation of the navigation laws. From the
beginning of our Government officers of revenue cutters
have, for the purpose of enforcing the customs laws, been
expressly authorized to board and search inbound vessels on the high seas within twelve miles of our coast.
It is not to be lightly assumed that Congress intended to
deny to revenue cutters so engaged authority to seize
American vessels found to be violating our navigation
laws. Nor is it lightly to be assumed that Congress intended to deny to officers of revenue cutters engaged in
enforcing other laws of the United States beyond the
twelve-mile limit, the authority to seize American vessels
found to be violating our navigation laws beyond those
limits.
From the beginning of our government, it has been
the practice of revenue cutters to make such seizures.
The official records and judicial decisions show that revenue cutters were employed early in our history, and that
they have been employed continuously since, in enforcing
our navigation laws upon the high seas regardless of distance from the coast; and that, whether operating
within the United States or without, they have, regardless
of distance from the coast, seized American vessels found
violating our laws, without regard to whether the laws
violated related to the revenue.2 9 Congress has by-its aclaw, is in some respects analogous to the right of a belligerent, recognized by the international law, to seize contraband. See 2 Moore,
Digest International Law, § 309; The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1,
42; United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, 26 Fed. Cas. No. 15,551.
29 In most cases, the cutters merely report violations of law, without
making seizures. The reports do show, however, that when it was
thought necessary to arrest American vessels, the seizures were
made without regard to location. See The Elizabeth, 8 Fed. Cas.
No. 4, 352 (1810); The Eliza, 8 Fed. Cas. No. 4, 346 (1813); United
States v. The Little Ann, 26 Fed. Cas. No. 15,611 (1809), reversed

tion sanctioned this exertion of power. It supported the
activities of the service by ever increasing appropriations." It equipped the Coast Guard, before the Tariff
Act of 1922, with able cruising cutters, many of which
were engaged largely in patrol beyond the twelve-mile
limit. To seize anywhere on the high seas American yesBurke v. Trevitt, 4 Fed. Cas. No. 2, 163 (1816). Compare 3 Op.
Atty. Gen. 405. See also "Instructions to Officers in the United
States Revenue Cutter Service," October 3, 1834, p. 9; "Rules and
Regulations for the Government of the Revenue Marine," November
1, 1843, p. xv. Thus, in regard to specific American vessels, the
Commandant's office frequently sends out confidential orders to" seize
whenever and wherever found ", or to "board and search whenever
and wherever found."
The files of the Coast Guard show that from September 1, 1922, to
February 10, 1927, at least seventy-five American vessels were seized
beyond the twelve-mile limit, for violations of the Prohibition Act
alone; of these seizures at least twenty-one were made more than
thirty miles from the coast.
30
After the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment Congress made
each year a large increase in the appropriation for the Coast Guard;
and provided for the acquisition of additional vessels of the cruiser
type. Before the passage of the Tariff Act of 1922 the year's appropriations had been increased to $9,800,000 and the acquisition or construction of additional cruising vessels had been authorized. On
April 2, 1924, a special appropriation of $12,194,900 was made for
construction of additional ocean-going vessels and for reconditioning
and equipping those vessels which it authorized the Navy to transfer
to the Coast Guard. The appropriation for maintenance increased
to $20,800,000 by 1926.
In 1919, the aggregate of vessels boarded was 2,005; in 1922,
31,653; in 1925, 53,080. The number of vessels seized or reported for
violations of law increased from 601 in 1919 to 1,887 in 1925. It
should be noted that comparatively few of the penalties for minor
infractions of the law are collected. By the Act of February 14,
1903, c. 552, § 10, 32 Stat. 825, 829, the power to remit penalties and
forfeitures for violation of laws " relating to merchant vessels ",
theretofore in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury, was given
to the Secretary of Commerce. This power has been liberally exercised. See e. g., 1913 Annual Report of Comimnr of Navigation;
p. 23.

sels found violating our laws was thus, I think, within
the implied authority of its officers before the Act of 1922.
It remains to consider whether that Act abridged the
authority theretofore possessed.
Second: The Tariff Act of 1922 includes as Title IV a
revision of the customs administrative provisions then in
force. 42 Stat. 858, 948, et seq. In § 642 it recites the
provisions of the earlier law which the Act repealed.
Among these are §§ 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes. The former is the section which conferred upon
officers of the customs express power to seize "within or
without his district." The latter is the section which conferred upon them authority to board and search inbound
vessels within twelve miles of our coast. The sections
parallel to § 3067, relating specifically to officers of revenue cutters, first found in § 64 of the Act of 1790, reenacted as § 99 of the Act of 1799, and again as §§ 2760,
2761, 2762 of the Revised Statutes, were neither repeated
nor repealed by the Act of 1922. Nor did it repeat or
repeal § 3072. For the provisions repealed it substituted
§ 581, which, so far as material, is as follows:
31 The second paragraph of § 581, 42 Stat. 979, relates solely to
officers of vessels of the Department of Commerce. It is as follows:
"Officers of the Department of Commerce and other persons
authorized by such department may go on board of any vessel at
any place in the United States or within four leagues of the coast
of the United States and hail, stop, and board such vessels in the
enforcement of the navigation laws and arrest or, in case of escape
or attempted escape, pursue and arrest any person engaged in the
breach or violation of the navigation laws."
Prior to 1903, the Secretary of the Treasury was charged with both
the administration and the enforcement of the navigation laws. The
administration was committed in part to the collectors of the ports,
in part to the Bureau of Navigation. The enforcement was committed in part to the collectors, in part to the Revenue Cutter Service.
In that year Congress created the Department of Commerce and
Labor and transferred to it the Bureau of Navigation. Act of February 14, 1903, c. 552, 32 Stat. 825. In 1913 that bureau became a

"Boarding Vessels.-Officers of the customs or of the
Coast Guard, and agents or other persons authorized by
the Secretary of the Treasury, or appointed for that purpose in writing by a collector may at any time go on
board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the United
States or within four leagues of the coast of the United
States, without as well as within their respective districts,
to examine the manifest and to inspect, search, and examine the vessel or vehicle, and every part thereof, and any
person, trunk, or package on board, and to this end to
hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, if under way, and
use all necessary -force to compel compliance, and if it
shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of
the United States has been committed, whereby or in
consequence of which such vessel or vehicle, or the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board of or imported by
such vessel or vehicle is liable to forfeiture, it shall be
the duty of such officer to make seizure of the same, and
to arrest, or, in case of escape or attempted escape, to
pursue and arrest any person engaged in such breach or
violation."
The provision quoted above was adopted by Congress
without substantial change from the draft of a bill contained in the report "Upon the Revision of the Customs
Administrative Laws" made by the United States Tariff
Commission to the Committee on Ways and Means in
1918, and re-submitted in 1921. Whether intentionally
or not, the paragraph of § 581 quoted above introduced
part of the new Department of Commerce. Act of March 4, 1913,
c. 141, 37 Stat. 736. Thereby certain duties in respect to the administration of the navigation laws passed to the Department of Commerce. To enable it to take some part also in the enforcement of the
navigation laws Congress provided it with a few cutters. See Annual
Report of Commissioner of Navigation, 1915, pp. 31-32. The above
paragraph was inserted at the instance of the Department of Commerce when the Customs Administration law was in the conference
committee.

two changes into the statutory law. Unlike the earlier
statutes, it did not limit to inbound vessels the right to
board and search. And, unlike the earlier statutes, it
apparently conferred (through the inclusion of the grant
of authority to seize in the same paragraph with the
grant of authority to board or search) upon all customs
officers the right to seize any vessel on any waters within
the twelve-mile limit.2 The reports of the Commission
and those of the Committees of Congress discuss many
proposed changes in the customs administrative laws.
But nowhere in the reports of the Commission or of Congress, or in the statute enacted, is there a suggestion of
purpose to abridge by this provision the authority theretofore possessed by the Coast Guard to make seizure on
the high seas. It seems clear that Congress did not by
this revision intend that the power to seize on the high
seas for violation of laws respecting the revenue should
remain, but that the similar power to seize for violation
of other laws should be taken away.
Since, in my opinion, R. S. § 3059 had not conferred
any express power to seize beyond territorial waters, I
do not think its repeal shows any intention to take away
the then existing implied power of the Coast Guard to
seize American vessels anywhere on the high seas, for
violation of any law of the United States. There is no
foundation for the assumption of the claimant that the
first paragraph of § 581 was intended as the exclusive
grant of the power to seize. The primary purpose of
that paragraph was not to provide for the seizure of
American vessels of known or suspected guilt. It was
to facilitate, by means of boarding and examination of
manifest before arrival in port, both the entry of admittedly innocent vessels and the collection of revenues.
This end was furthered by enabling customs officers to
board and search any vessel, foreign or domestic, within

the stated limits, without the necessity of establishing
probable cause. The authority to board and search foreign vessels beyond the territorial limits would doubtless
not have been implied as a mere incident of the customs
officers' duties, and it is probable that the authority to
board and search American vessels in the absence of probable cause was not regarded as clear.
Other action of Congress taken at about the same time
shows that Congress had no purpose to abridge the Coast
Guard's activities or powers. The appropriation acts
make provision for large increases in equipment and personnel to enable it to combat the increased smuggling
operations following upon the enactment of the National
Prohibition Law. Moreover, conventions were negotiated with Great Britain and other foreign nations to secure permission to seize their vessels on the high seas if
found engaged in smuggling operations." Neither in the
negotiations nor in the conventions was any reference
made to a twelve-mile limit. The limitation agreed upon
was an hour's run from our coast. The distance covered
by the hour's run would often greatly exceed twelve miles
from our coast. But Congress did not deem it necessary
to enact supplementary legislation in order to make the
conventions effective. 4
