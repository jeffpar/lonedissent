control." The court rejected that conclusion and denied
to the acts of Congress retroactive operation. To this the
Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed and reversed the
judgment based upon it.
It will be observed, therefore, that this case involves
the same question as that decided in Shwab v. Doyle,
ante, 529, and on the authority of that case the judgment
of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause
remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.

elsewhere, upon its contracts and for its torts, notwithstanding the
fact that it was a federal agency and that its stock was taken
entirely by the United States. P. 565.
2. The extensive increase of the powers of this corporation made by
later acts and by delegation from the President of large powers
granted him by Congress, did not render the corporation in all
cases immune to private suit. P. 566.
3. A bill alleged that the Fleet Corporation, having contracted,
May 18, 1917, with a shipbuilding company for the construction
of vessels, on December 1, 1917, unlawfully took possession of the
property of the company and its subsidiaries and compelled it to
make another contract, which the bill sought to set aside, praying
also for restoration of the properties, an accounting under the
earlier contract and other relief. Held:
(a) That the bill stated a cause of action against the Fleet Corporation, cognizable by a District Court, since
(b) It could not be assumed from the allegations that the taking
was in pursuance of powers which had been delegated to the
Fleet Corporation by the President, directly or through the
Shipping Board, when the taking occurred, or that it was within
the ratification of past acts of the Fleet Corporation made by
the Executive Order of December 3, 1918; and, consequently,
(c) It did not appear that the special remedies of payment by and
suit against the United States in the Court of Claims, for plants
taken by the President, were applicable to the case. P. 567.
4. The Fleet Corporation is liable to be sued for its unlawful acts,
even if a remedy also exists by suit against the United States.
P. 567.
5. The general immunity of the United States to actions for torts
does not extend to those who act in its name. P. 568.
6. The provision in the general incorporation law of the Distriet
of Columbia (Code D. C., § 607) that corporations formed under
it may sue and be stied in the District does not mean that they
may not be sued elsewhere. P. 568.
7. A contract made by the Fleet Corporation " representing the
United States of America," is the contract of the Corporation and
subject to be set aside in a.suit against it, if wrongfully brought
about. P. 568.
8. Transfer of the property of the Fleet Corporation to the Shippin. Board by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, § 4, 41 Stat. 088,
did not affect the jurisdiction to entertain the present suits.

9.A suit against the Fleet Corporation is removable from a state to
a federal court. P. 569.
10. The Fleet Corporation held suable in a state court for breach of
a contract executed by it February 1, 1919, as a corporation of the
District of Columbia "representing the United States of America"
in which certain necessities and rights of the United States were
recognized but in which the Corporation was recognized throughout as the immediate party contracting. P. 569.
11. A claim in bankruptcy made by the Fleet Corporation in its
own name as an instrument of the Government is not entitled to
preference as a claim of the United States. P. 570.
268 Fed. 624; 272 Fed. 132; 270 Fed. 635, reversed.
274 Fed. 893, affirmed.

THE first of these cases is an appeal from a decree of
the District Court dismissing on motion, for want of jurisdiction, a bill against the Fleet Corporation, (the general nature of the bill is described in the third headnote)
upon the ground that the suit, involving more than
$10,000, must be brought in the Court of Claims. The
second is a writ of error to a judgment of the District
Court which, upon the same ground, sustained a demurrer to the petition in an action for breach of contract brought against the Fleet Corporation, originally
in a court of the State. The third comes here by certiorari to an order of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming one of the District Court denying preference to
a claim made by the Fleet Corporation in a bankruptcy
proceeding.

were on the brief, for the United States Shipping Board
Emergency Fleet Corporation.
The Fleet Corporation is a valid incorporated instrumentality and agent of the United States; and all of its
contracts and acts here involved were made and performed, not in its own corporate interest, but exclusively
for the United States in the execution of the war powers of Congress.
In many cases corporations have been held to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and, as such,
exempt from even the great reserved powers of the
States. Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29, 33, 34; Easton v. Iowa, 188 U. S. 220,
230, 237; Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 524, 525; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf
R. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292, 298; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522,
530; Bank of California v. Richardson, 248 U. S. 476,
483; Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S.
180. In none of them did the relation of the instrumentality to the execution of federal powers begin to approach in directness or in exclusiveness of purpose the
immediate relation of the Fleet Corporation to the exercise of Congress's power to declare war and regulate commerce.
In determining whether or not a given corporation is
an instrumentality of the United States, it is not material whether the United States owns all of the stock,
Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra; Ballaine
v. Alaska Northern Ry. Co., 259 Fed. 183; none of the
stock, Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing,
supra; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U. S. 525,
First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., 244 U. 6. 416:
or only a part of the stock, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316; Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738; but the
United States' complete ownership of the stock may

553

Argument for Fleet Corporation.

fairly be adverted to as indicating that the United States
desired to have, and has, absolute and complete control
over the instrumentality to which it has confided the execution of such vast governmental powers.
An agent of the Government is not liable upon contracts made by him on its behalf. Hodgson v. Dexter,
1 Cr. 345; Sheets v. Selden's Lessee, 2 Wall. 177, 187;
District of Columbia v. Camden Iron Works, 181 U. S.
453, 460; Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 17; Parks v.
Ross, 11 How. 362, 374; Jones v. Le Tombe, 3 Dall. 383;
Garlandv. Davis,74 How. 131, 148.
Whatever the Fleet Corporation did, either in signing
the contracts with the Astoria Company, the Eastern
Shore, and the Sloan Shipyards, or in seizing the latter's
plant, or in canceling its contracts with third parties, was
done by it just as the same acts might have been done by
any individual acting as the delegate of the President's war powers, pursuant to express authorization by
Congress.
It is unnecessary to consider what the precise status of
the Fleet Corporation would have been had it acted solely
under its corporate powers as limited and defined by the
Shipping Act 1916. The Corporation was not organized
until after the United States had entered the war, and
did not function otherwise than as the delegate of the
President under the emergency war legislation, until after
the passage of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 41 Stat.
988. It was not until after the declaration of war, and in
response to the President's appeal for ships, that the machinery of the Shipping Act 1916 was utilized to create
the Fleet Corporation as an instrumentality that might
be used to execute the war powers of Congress.
The Fleet Corporation acquired, just as any private
individual would have acquired, a special status as a federal instrumentality, when the President, under the Act
of June 15, 1917, and subsequent legislation, delegated
his war powers to it.

554

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Argument for Fleet Corporation.

258 U. S.

This is obvious when it is observed that neither the
Shipping Act 1916, the District of Columbia corporation
laws, nor the Fleet Corporation's certificate of incorporation authorized it: To condemn land or houses for employees; to build houses (40 Stat. 438); to take possession of, lease, or assume control of street railways or interurban railroads (40 Stat. 535); to extend or improve
such street railways or interurban railroads (40 Stat.
1022); to condemn lumber camps, sawmills, standing
timber, rights of way, etc. (40 Stat. 888); or to requisition dry docks, marine railways, discharging terminals,
etc. (40 Stat. 1022)-all of which powers were conferred
on the Fleet Corporation by Congress, either directly or
by delegation of the President. It was under these delegated powers that the Corporation performed or committed each of the acts which are made the basis of the
present suits.
Congress has, in various ways, recognized that the Fleet
Corporation, at least in its existence and operations as
delegate of the war powers of Congress, is but a governmental bureau, and not a private corporation in the ordinary sense.
It should be borne in mind that the Fleet Corporation,
while technically incorporated under the laws of the District under the authority of the Shipping Act 1916, was
a mere empty shell and never received its $50,000,000
capital until after the President had delegated to it his
war powers; that the capital was all spent in administration expenses, and that whatever property it ever acquired, or now has, was acquired: from appropriations
made to carry out the war power delegations of Congress
and the President, and is exclusively the property of the
United States.
The Fleet Corporation could not acquire any beneficial
or proprietary interest in any property obtained as the
delegate of the President's war powers or as an agency

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.

of the United. States. It could only hold the property
in trust for the United States. Hence, the provisions of
the Merchant Marine Act 1920, § 4, 41 Stat. 990, transferring all vessels and other property acquired by the
President through any agency whatsoever to the Shipping Board.
Whether the suit is one against the Umted States is
determined, not by the fact of the party named as defendant on the record, but by the question of the effect
of the judgment which can be rendered; and whether the
United States is the real party in interest. Louisiana v.
McAdoo, 234 U. S. 627, 629; Kansas v. United States,
204 U. S. 331, 341; Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 60, 68;
Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, 384, 386, 387.
In determining whether a given suit is really one
against the United States, exactly the same rules apply
as obtain in determining whether a suit is against one of
the several States. Kansas v. United States, 204 U. S.
331, 341; Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204, 213.
The United States is the real party in interest because:
In the Astoria Case a money judgment is asked against
the Fleet Corporation a damages on a contract which it
-made as delegate of the President and in which it described itself as "representing the United States of
America," and any judgment recovered, if ever paid, could
only be paid out of a congressional appropriation; in
the Sloan Shipyards Case the property sought to be irpounded and restored is in the possession of the United
States and was taken by seizure under, requisition on
December 1, 1917, and the mortgage sought to be canceled
is also the property of the United States and was given to
secure a $1,000,000 bond running to the Fleet Corpdration "representing the United States of America" under
a contract also entered into "representing the United
States of America "; and in the Eastern Shore Case the
claim of the Fleet Corporation is for moneys due under

556

258 U. S.

a contract which it made "representing the United States
of America ", and the claim, while in the name of the
Fleet Corporation, is for the United States, and priority
of payment is demanded as a "debt due to the United
States ".
The United States is an indispensable party because in
the Sloan Shipyards, Case the United States is in possession of all the property and the actual owner -of the
$1,000,000 mortgage sought to be canceled, title thereto
having been taken (if not already in it) by the Merchant
Mariie Act 1920; and it is inconceivable that a decree
changing possession of property or canceling a mortgage
can be rendered without the presence of the possessor of
the property and the owner of the thing canceled. NilesBement-Pond Co. v. Iron Molders' Union, 254 U. S. 77,

137, 147.
This court has held that a suit may be maintained
against an officer or agent of a State or the United States,
and that it is not a suit against the sovereign, in the following circumstances, none of which apply to the cases
at bar, to wit:
(1) To enjoin a state officer from taking any threatened
future action in the name of or for the State, under color
of his office, to enforce, or in pursuance of, an unconstitutional statute, Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 868;
Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220; Board of Liquidation
v. McComb, 92 U. S. 531, 541; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1, 10, 12; In re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164,

155; Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 37; Looney v. Crane
Co., 245 U. S. 178, 191; Terral v. Burke Construction
Co., 257 U. S. 529. And the suit is equally maintainable
where the threatened future action is to enforce or carry
out an unconstitutional action (for example, confiscatory) of a state officer proceeding under a valid statute,
Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., 244 U. S.
499, 507; Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., 207
U. S. 20, 38; Reagan v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co.,
154 U. S. 362, 390; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v.
Greene, 244 U. S. 522, 528; provided, of course, the
threatened wrong be such as equity will enjoin; and the
fact that the officer is threatening to commit the wrong
in the name of the State and under the color of his
office is of no significance whatever; for the wrong will
be enjoined just as if he were acting in his individual
capacity.
(2) To enjoin an officer (a) from doing a threatened
future act (for example, canceling a patent, etc., which
would cast a cloud on plaintiff's title) when such action
was about to be taken through a mistaken conception
of his authority, Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S.
1; Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., 147 U. S.
165, 171, 172; School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty,
187 U. S. 94, 110; Lane v. Watts, 234 U. S. 525, 540;
Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., 255 U. S. 228, 238,
and those cases are quite similar to the cases involving
merely ministerial action presently to be noticed; or (b)
from instigating criminal proceedings involving the same
legal questions as those presented in a pending equity
suit for the protection of property rights. Philadelphia
Co. v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 621, 622.
(3) To compel by mandamus the performance by
the' officer of some plain, unmistakable, mere ministerial duty, prescribed by some special statute, and not
affecting the general powers or functions of the Gov-

U. S. 683-694; Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. R.
Co., 109 U. S. 446, 452-453.
(4) To recover damages at law, for a past act of tort
by a state official or instrumentality, done in good faith,
in the name of the State under color of office, where the
officer, having no personal interest, was mistaken in
thinking he had the lawful right to take the action he
did, Bates v. -Clark, 95 U. S. 204, 209; White v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 307; Chaffin v. Taylor, 114 U. S. 310;

U. S. 636, 645; Johnson v. Lankford, 245 U. S. 541, 546;
Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 18, 23, 26 as to the
damages at law; arguendo see Cunningham v. Macon &
Brunswick R. R. Co., 109 U. S. 446, 452; and a fortiori
where the official's act was arbitrary, capricious and in
disregard of the law. Johnson v. Lankford, 245 U. S.
541, 546.
(5) To recover specific property, real or personal, because of the present wrongful action of an official, in
good faith, and under color of office,. unlawfully withholding plaintiff's property under the erroneous belief
that the law authorized such withholding. 'United States
v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196; Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204,

The cases at bar fall within one or more of the follow-

ing classes of suits which have been held to be, in effect,
suits against the State or the United States and, hence,
not maintainable:
(1) Interference with the funds or property in the
possession of the State. Lankford v. Platte Iron Works,
235 U. S. 461; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S.
104; Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151;
Goldberg v. Daniels, 231 U. S. 218, 221; International
Postal Co. v. Bruce, 194 U. S. 601; Belknap v. Schild, 161
U. S. 10; Christian v. Atlantic & North Carolina R. R.
Co., 133 U. S. 233; Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick
R. R. Co., 109 U. S. 446; Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S.
711; Case v. Terrell, 11 Wall. 199.
(2) Attempts to compel or restrain, action regarding
title to lands. Knight v. Lane, 228 U. S. 6; Ness v.
Fisher, 223 U. S. 683; Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock,
190 U. S. 316; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373;
Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U: S. 60; Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70; Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U. S. 508.
It is abundantly settled that suits cannot be brought
against governmental officers the object of which is (a)
to compel the execution of a contract, International Construction Co. v. Lamont, 155 U. S. 303; (b) to compel
acts to be done, which, when done, would constitute performance by the State of a contract, or to enjoin things
from being done which if done would constitute a breach
by the State of a contract, In re A.yers, 123 U. S. 443;
Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52; (c) to compel some
affirmative official action in the performance of an obligation of the State, Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52, 69,
70; or (d) to collect money, Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S.
436) 439; Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711, 726-8; Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 26; where, under the principles enunciated in the foregoing cases, the State being a
necessary party, on account of the effect of the decree on
its property or rights, the bill must be dismissed. Wells

v. Roper, 246 U. S: 335, 337; Christian v. Atlantic &
North Carolina R. R. Co., 133 U. S. 232, 241, 244, 245;
Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. R. 'Co., 109 U. S'.
446, 451, 457.
(3) Injunctions to restrain executive officers or agents
from the performance of their duty. Wells v. Roper, 246
U. S. 335; Louisiana v. JVcAdoo, 234 U. S. 627; United
States v. Black, 126 U. S. 40, 48; Decatur v. Paulding, 14
Pet. 497, 515.
In the light of the foregoing authorities, the present
suits against the Fleet Corporation are in substance and
effect suits against the United States, because they relate
only to acts performed by th6 Corporation, not under any
general corporate power as derived from its incorporation, but as the specially selected agency to carry out the
war powers of the President. To the same effect, see
Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 250 U. S. 135,
152; Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, 250
U. S. 163; Macleod v. New England Telephone Co., 250
U. S. 195; Kansas v. Burleson, 250 U. S. 188.
As the wrongs of which the Sloan Shipyards complains
were all committed by the Fleet Corporation while acting
under the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 183, it is plain
that the Shipyards' exclusive remedy is to follow the
provisions of that statute, just as Congress provided with
respect to a great number of other war-time requisitions.
See United States A. Pfitsch, 256 U. S. 547.
When Congress undertook to authorize requisitioning,
cancelation., etc., and to afford, as under the Fifth Amendment it was bound to afford, a provision for just compensation, its legislation on that point was necessarily exclusive, Arnson v. Murphy 109 U. S. 238, 243; United States
v. Babcock, 250 U. S. 328, 331; and until the plaintiff shall
have had an award by the President, it has no right to
maintain any suit, even if it be conceded for the sake of
argument that the Fleet Corporation is ordinarily suable

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.

as any other corporation. There is no more reason to
bring suit against the Fleet Corporation when it was
acting, as the authorized delegate of the President in the
requisitioning of plants, ships, contracts, and materials,
than there would be to bring suit against the President
or the Secretary of the Navy when he was acting as such
delegate of Congress' powers. United States v. Babcock,
250 U. S.328, 331; Geddes v. Anaconda Mining Co., 254
U. S. 590, 593.
The entire point of United States Bank v. Planters'
Bank, 9 Wheat. 904; Bank of Kentucky v. Wister, 2 Pet.
318, 324; and United States v. Strang, 254 U. S.491, and
similar cases, is that agents of a corporation are not generally agents of the stockholders and cannot contract for
them by virtue of the mere relation of the stockholder to
the corporation but that is a very different thing from a
stockholder affirmatively constituting the corporation his
agent or instrumentality for carrying out his 9wn purposes.
The general provision of the District of Columbia Code.
§ 607, that a corporation organized thereunder should
"be capable of suing and being sued in any court of law
or equity in the District," only intended to render this
corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court in the District (see National
Volunteer Home v. Parrish, 229 U. S. 494, 497), where

Claims (id. § 145); but the learned judges delivering
those opinions apparently overlooked the point that the
United States had given a special consent to be sued only'
for any balance that might be claimed in excess of 75' ,,
of the President's award of "just compensation," and
that such consent was exclusive and rendered inapplicable
the general provisions of the Judicial Code cited.
Even conceding that the provision for " just compensation" is not exclusive and that actions may be maintained under Jud. Code, §§ 24, 145. there is certainly no
jurisdiction to sue the Fleet Corporation in the state
courts. Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436-445.
Just as, under some circumstances, the States may tax
property used by agents of the United States in executing
governmental powers, Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co.,
224 U. S. 362; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore,
195 U. S. 375, 382; and also the property of corporations
chartered by Congress and engaged in performing federal
services, Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall.'579; Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 30-35; while, on the other
hand, the States cannot tax the property of other governmental instrumentalities, Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf
R. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292; Farmers& Mechanics
Savings Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516; Owensboro
National Ba;tk v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664; so it is that
many corporations chartered by Congress are ordinarily
subject to suit, as the acts of incorporation usually provide that they may sue and be sued, while, on the other
hand, such corporations may be immune from suit if the
nature of the transaction is such that by established rules
of law such a suit cannot be maintained.
When power is conferred upon a corporation to sue and.
be sued, it derivbs only the same power which each individual inherently possesses. Therefore, in many instances
heretofore cited where individuals were immune from suit
because the suit was really against the State or the United

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.

Argument for Fleet Corporation.

States, such immunity would also have attached to any
corporation, if it had been occupying the identical position of agency which the individual occupied.
The effect of the decision in The Lake Monroe, 250 U.
S. 246, was simply to hold that under the Act of 1918 if,
and when, the Shipping Board chartered a vessel to private parties for merchant use, such vessel, notwithstanding the United States' ownership or interest therein, became subject to the ordinary rules of admiralty law. The
United States by this act simply waived the immunity
which it otherwise had, which was a recognition that
otherwise the Fleet Corporation, its property and operations were exempt-an admission that the Fleet Corporation occupied such a relation to the Federal Government
as an instrumentality thereof that property in its possession or control was not its own private corporate property, but was that of the United States.
In order to do away with The Lake Monroe decision,
Congress promptly adopted the Suits in Admiralty Act
of March 9, 1920, 41 Stat. 525, prohibiting the seizure of
any vessel owned, possessed or operated by or for the
United. States or the Fleet Corporation, so long as the
United States owned all its stock.
If the decision in The Lake Monroe be given the effect
attributed to it by the District Courts in Gould Coupler
Co. v. Fleet Corporation, 261 Fed. 716; Lord & Burnham v. Fleet Corporation, 265 Fed. 955, 958; Perna v.
Fleet Corporation, 266 Fed. 896; and American Cotton
Oil Co. v. Fleet Corporation,270 Fed. 296, the result will
be to subject the United States to liability in tort, affirmative relief in equity, and to suits for unlimited aniounts
in the state courts and for amounts in excess of $10,000
in the federal courts, to neither of which has it ever heretofore consented; and to give to persons having business
relations with the Fleet Corporation a discriminatory
advantage over all other persons having similar business
relations with other government departments.

JUSTICE

HOLIMzEs delivered the opinion of the court.

These cases present in different ways the question of
the standing of the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation in the Courts-the first two,
whether it so far embodies the United States that these
suits should have been brought in the Court of Claims;
the third whether it is entitled to a preference against a
bankrupt which it is asserted would belong to the United
States if the United States claimed in its own name. The
facts material at this stage can be told in a few words.
The Shipping Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451, 39 Stat.
728, passed no doubt in contemplation of the possibility
of' war, to create a'naval reserve and merchant marine,
established the United States Shipping Board and gave
it power to form a corporation under the laws of the
District of Columbia for the purchase, construction and
operation of merchant vessels-the corporation to be
dissolved "at the expiration of five years from the conclusion of the present European war." The stock was
not to exceed $50,000,000, and the Board was authorized
to purchase not less than a majority of such stock. War
was declared on April 6, 1917, and the corporation was
formed on the 16th of the same month.

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.
549.

565

Opinion of the Court.

The first case is a bill brought by the Sloan Shipyards
Corporation, the Capital City Iron Works and the Anacortes Shipbuilding Company. According to the allegations, on May 18, 1917, the new corporation made an
elaborate contract with the Sloan Shipyards Corporation
for the building by the latter of sixteen wooden vessels.
At that time the Emergency Fleet Corporation had only
the powers given by the incorporation laws of the District.
The work was begun by the Sloan Shipyards Corporation
and by the two other complainants, which were subsidiary
companies organized for the purpose of carrying out that
contract, and went on until December 1, 1917, at which
time the Fleet Corporation refused to make further payments required by the contract, unlawfully took possession
of all the property of the three companies named, has
retained it ever since, and has done a series of acts causing
them great loss. It is alleged that the defendant having
thus got the Sloan Shipyards Corporation wholly within
its power compelled it to execute another contract set
forth. The bill seeks to have this contract set aside, to
have an accounting on the footing of the original contract
of May 18, to have the defendant charged with all
indebtedness incurred since December 1, 1917, and required to restore the properties described in the bill. The
bill was dismissed by the District Court on the ground
that as the claim was for more than $10,000 the suit must
be brought in the Court of Claims. 268 Fed. 624; 272
Fed. 132.
The Shipping Act contemplated a corporation in which
private persons might be stockholders and which was to
be formed like any business corporation under the laws
of the District, with capacity to sue and be sued. The
United States took all the. stock but'that did not affect
the legal position of the company. United States v.
Strang, 254 U. S. 491. At that stage the original contract
was made. Subsequently the powers of the corporation

Opinion of the Court.

258 U. S.

were greatly enlarged. On July 11, 1917, the President
delegated to it the powers that had been conferred upon
him by the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, applicable to the construction, purchase and requisitioning of
vessels in process of construction and of materials for ship
construction, and delegated tb the Shipping Board his
powers to take by purchase or requisition constructed
vessels and the operation of all vessels acquired by the
United States, with authority to exercise these powers
either directly or through the Fleet Corporation. Whether
the Fleet Corporation did or could rely upon this delegation in its alleged acts of December, 1917, or whether it
purported to be acting under powers conferred upon it by
the contract does not appear from the allegations of the
bill. Subsequently the Fleet Corporation by successive
acts and proclamations was authorized to condemn various
forms of property. Act of March 1, 1918, c. 19, 40 Stat.
438. April 22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535. July 9, 1918, c.
143, 40 Stat. 845, 888. November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat.
1020, 1022. Executive Order of December 3, 1918, delegating all powers as to ship or plant construction and
ratifying previous acts. Perhaps it is enough to add a
reference to the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988,
993, continuing the existence of the Fleet Corporation and
its authority to operate vessels until all vessels are sold
as directed by the act, § 11, but transferring the title to
the Shipping Board. § 4.
These provisions sufficiently indicate the enormous
powers ultimately given to the Fleet Corporation. They
have suggested the argument that it was so far put in
place of the sovereign as to share the immunity of the
sovereign from suit otherwise than as the sovereign allows.
But such a notion is a very dangerous departure from one
of the first principles of our system of law. The sovereign
properly so called is superior to suit for reasons that often
bave been explained. But the general rule is that any

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.

Opinion of the Court.

person within the jurisdiction always is amenable to the
law. If he is sued for conduct harmful to the plaintiff his
only shield is a constitutional rule of law that exonerates
him. Supposing the powers of the Fleet Corporation to
have been given to a single man we doubt if anyone would
contend that the acts of Congress and the delegations of
authority from the President left him any less liable than
other grantees of the power of eminent domain to be
called upon t9 defend himself in court. An instrumentality of government he might be and for the greatest
ends, but the agent, because he is agent, does not cease
to be answerable for his acts. Osborn v. Bank of United
States, 9 Wheat. 738, 842, 843; United States v. Lee, 106
U. S. 196, 213, 221. The opposite notion left some traces
in the law, 1 Roll. Abr. 95, Action sur Case, T., but for
the most part long has disappeared.
If what we have said is correct it cannot matter that
the agent is a corporation rather than a single man. The
meaning of incorporation is that you have a person, and
as a person one that presumably is subject to the general
rules of law. The only serious question is whether special
remedies have been provided by statute that displace those
that otherwise would be at the plaintiff's command. The
Acts of April 22, 1918, c. 62, § 3, 40 Stat. 535, and of
July 18, 1918, c. 157, § 13, 40 Stat. 913, 916, give compensation for a plaiit taken by the President under the powers
conferred by the Act of June 15, 1.917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182,
and otherwise, with a resort for claims exceeding $10,000
to the Court of Claims; in the later act, by a suit against
the United States. But the taking possession. of the
plaintiffs' plants on December 1, 1917, is alleged to have
been unlawful and it cannot be assumed at this stage that
the act of the Fleet Corporation was in pursuance of any
powers then delegated to it or was within the ratification
of December 3, 1918. The plaintiffs are not suing the
United States but the Fleet Corporation, and if its act

was unlawful, even if they might have sued the United
States, they are not cut off from a remedy against the
agent that did the wrongful act. In general the United
States cannot be sued for a tort, but its immunity does
not extend to those that acted in its name. It is not impossible that the Fleet Corporation purported to act under
the contract giving it the right to take possession in
certain events, but that the plhintiffs can show that the
events had not occurred. The District Judge gave weight
to the phrase in the general incorporation law of the
District that corporations formed under it shall be capable
of suing and being sued in any Court in the District.
Code, D. C. § 607. But we do not read those words as
putting District corporations upon a different footing
-from those formed under the laws of the States.
We attach no importance to the fact that the second
contract, alleged to have been illegally extorted, was made
with the Fleet Corporation "representing the United
States of America." The Fleet Corporation was the contractor, even if the added words had any secondary effect.
But the bill alleges that it was brought about by the
wrongful act of the Fleet Corporation. The Conclusion
that we reach is that the District Court erred in dismissing
the bill and we regard it as led up to and almost required
by the decisions heretofore reached in The Lake Monroe,
250 U. S. 246, and United States v. Strang, 254 U. S. 491.
See further Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South
Dakota, 250 U. S. 163, 177, 178. Northern Pacific Ry.
Co. v. North Dakota, 250 U. S. 135, 152. The transfer
of the property of the Fleet Corporatioi to the Shipping
Board by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, § 4, 41 Stat. 988,
990, may affect the value of the remedy afforded by the
present suit but not the jurisdiction of the Court.
- It is suggested that there will be lack of uniformity if
suits can be brought in State Courts. This consideration
cannot control our conclusion from the statutes. But it

is not very serious since such suits against this Corport.tion can be removed to the Courts of the United States,
Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, 115 .U. S. 1, and afterwards are subject to review here. Creswill v. Grand
Lodge Knights of Pythias, 225 U. S. 246, 258. Southern
Pacific Co. v. Stewart, 245 U. S. 359; ibid. 562. The
change in the law by the Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22,
§ 5, 38 Stat. 803, 804, extends only to railroads. The.
decree of the District Court must be reversed.
In the next case the Astoria Marine Iron Works sued
in a State Court for breach of a contract set forth. The
suit was removed to the District Court and there dismissed
upon demurrer on the same ground as the last-that the
only remedy was in the Court of Claims. 270 Fed.
635. This contract was made on February 1, 1919, when
the character of the Fleet Corporation had been more
fully developed and determined than in the previois-case,
and purported to be made with the Fleet Corporation, "a
Corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
District of Columbia (herein called the 'Corporation'),
representing the United States of America, party of the
second part." Throughout the contract the undertakings
of the party of the second part are expressed to be undertakings of the Corporation and it is this corporation and
its officers that are to be satisfied. in regard to what is
required from the Iron Works. It is recognized that it
may be necessary for the United States to exercise complete control over the furnishing of supplies to the Iron
Works and it is agreed that if required by the Corporation "and/or the United States" the Iron Works will
furnish schedules, &c., &c. The whole frafne of the instrument seems to us plainly to recognize the Corporation as
the immediate party to the contract. The distinction
between it and the United States is marked in the phrase
last quoted. If we are right in this, further reasoning
seems to us unnecessary to show that there was jurisdic-

tion of the suit. The fact that the corporation was formed
under the general laws of the District of Columbia is
persuasive, even standing alone, that it was expecfed to
contract and to stand suit in its own person, whatever
indemnities might be furnished by the United States.
The judgment in this case also must be reversed.
The third case, as we have said, is a claim of priority in
bankruptcy. It was asserted against the estate of the
Eastern Shore Shipbuilding Corporation, in the District
Court for the Southern District of New York, under a
contract similar to that last described, made by that Company with the Fleet Corporation " representing the United
States of America" to construct six harbor tugs. The
claim was presented by the Fleet Corporation in its own
name, but was put forward by it as an instrumentality of
the Government of the United States. It was denied
successively by the referee, .the District Court and the
Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the Fleet
Corporation was a distinct entity, and that, whatever
might be the law as to a direct claim of the United States,
the Fleet Corporation stood like other creditors and was
not to be preferred. 274 Fed. 893. The considerations
that have been stated apply even more obviously to this

senting.
I differ with the majority in the first two of these three
cases. The question presented is one of the interpreta,tion of the will of -Congress. No one can contend that
Congress in using the Fleet Corporation for its purpose8
might not have given it express immunity from suit as a

and CIaKE, JJ., dissenting.

representative of the United States. What we have to,
decide is whether in the mass of urgent legislation in respect to the Government's construction and operation of
shipping made indispensable by the peculiar exigencies of
the great war, Congress intended that this corporate agent
should be subject to suit only as its principal is. I concede *that-the legislation originally creating this corporation, without express immunity from suit, naturally gives
rise to the inference that Congress concluded that the
greater freedom of action secured by carrying on business
in corporate form was desirable and that in the absence
of express provision for it, and in respect to What the corporation was originally intended to do, immunity can not
be reasonably implied from the relation of the Government to the corporation and its interest in its business.
As I read the record, however, the transactions in the
two cases I am discussing, and which we have to consider,
took place after the situation prompting the creation of
this corporation had greatly changed and after much additional legislation. The power to do the things which
were here done, and which are the subjects of these suits,
is not to be found in the act creating the Fleet Corporation or in legislation expanding its original faculties. It
was power vested directly in the President himself, the
exercise of which he was given express authority to delegate to an agent, who might be the Fleet Corporation.
The act conferring this Presidential power provided a
specific remedy for compensation to those whose property
rights were invaded by its exercise through award by the
President and immediate payment of part due thereunder,
with the right to the claimant to litigate the justice of the
whole 'award in the Court of Claims. The Fleet Corporation in the arrangements which it forced upon the
claimants in these two cases to their detriment expressly
declared'that it acted as a representative of the United
States. I think the proper construction to be put upon

the facts and the law is that these suits are in fact againsi
the United States and can not be brought except in the
manner and under the procedure provided by the statute
for claims for compensation for acts done by authority of
the President under the act vesting him with it.
The opinion of the court is carefully drawn and if its
conclusion is to rest merely on the nice distinction that
it does not clearly appear from a proper construction of
the pleadings that the acts here complained of were acts
done under authority delegated by the President to the
Fleet Corporation, as his agent, then the question I have
been discussing and which seems to me to be in these cases
is not here decided, and will only arise on answer and
evidence.
I do not think that either the case of The Lake Monroe,
250 U. S. 246, or that of United States v. Strang,254 U. S.
491, requires the conclusion reached herein by the majority of the court, and, indeed, their opinion is not clear
and unqualified in reference to the effect of those cases.
I should not think it necessary to record a difference
with my brethren of the majority but for considerations
of high public expediency which may properly weigh with
us in construing a doubtful statute of Congress because
they must have been in the mind of Congress in the enactment of the legislation. We are made aware of the very
great number of suits pending and likely to arise out of
the work of the Fleet Corporation and the enormous total
involved in them. This was to be expected. Can Congress be supposed to have intended that these suits might
be brought in forty-eight different States and in courts
of first instance of those States with the lack of uniformity
in the findings of fact and the conclusions of law likely
to be encountered where trials are had. by courts and by
courts and juries in so many- varying jurisdictions? Did
it propose to allow the United States to be made liable
in litigation anywhere or under any form of procedure

SLOAN SHIPYARDS v. U. S. FLEET CORP.

573

TAFT, Ch. J., VAN DEVANTER and CLARKE, JJ., dissenting.

without any regulation on its part to secure a reasonable
limitation of its own as to the time within which such
suits shall be brought? The court suggests that judgments thus obtained will be good only against the Fleet
Corporation and the-claimants must run the risk of getting a judgment against a debtor which can not pay.
Congress has taken over all the assets of the Fleet Corporation so that such judgments will be valueless except
as Congress shall conclude to pay them. If, in the judgments obtained in the various courts of the country, Congress shall find such variety of view as not to commend
them to its sense of fairness, it will be slow to recognize
its obligation to pay them, and we shall have a repetition
of the history of the French Spoliation claims which for
many decades ofcupied the attention of appropriation
committees of Congress and wore out their patience with
results that have put in the hearts of claimants a deep
sense of the injustice of Governments. On the other
hand, a construction which will bring into one tribunal,
the Court of Claims, the hearing and decisi6n -of this class
of cases, will secure uniformity and dispatch and these
two elements will make for justice and peace, because
Congress pays the judgments of the Court of Claiihs
against the United States in due course. The result
reached by the court if it is to go as far as I fear it must,
even with the careful limitation of the language of the
judgment, will make the existing confusion as to the
claims against the Fleet Corporation worse confounded.
It is to be hoped that, if the ultimate view of the court of
the effect of the statutes under discussion is to spread this
litigation all over the country with ineffective and doubtful results dependent on future approval of .Congress,
Congress itself may by further remedial legislation avoid
such an undesirable condition, unfavorable both to the
United States and the litigants.
