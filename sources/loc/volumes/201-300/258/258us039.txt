Counsel for Parties.

Stats., ยง 721. Congress has made no provision that governs the liability in this -case and therefore has left it to
the law of the State where the wrong is done. If there
were no statute the common law of Massachusetts would
supplement the Constitution as it would supplement the
statutes of the State. But the common law of Massachusetts is not superior to its statutes and may be modifled by them at the pleasure' of the State, at least until
in some substantial sense it impairs substantive constitutional rights, which it has not attempted to do. Whether
in an otherwise proper case the proceeding.given by the
statute could be instituted in the District Court is not
before us here. See Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S. 449.

the Treasurer at common law. St. 1909, c. 490, Pt. III,

JONES v. UNITED) STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH

CIRCUIT.
No. 103.

Argued January 20, 1922.--Decided February 27, 1922.

1. One who, in pursuance of a scheme to acquire the land for himself, procures others to make homestead applications and entries,
knowing that they have no intention to establish residence or
otherwise comply with the law and that their proofs to the contrary, made with his connivance, and upon the faith of which the
patents are issued, are false, is guilty of defrauding the United
States of the value of the land. P. 47.
2. The right of the United States to recover damages for such a
fraud is not defeated by the facts that the period of residence
stated in the entry proofs was insufficient to comply with the
statute and that, but for a mistake of law in that regard upon
the part of the Land Department, the patents would not have
issued. P. 46.
3. In an action for fraud by inducing fraudulent entries resulting in
patents, evidence that the defendant induced other entrymen to
file on other land and of his conduct touching contracts on similar
claims, is admissible as bearing on his knowledge and intent, if
