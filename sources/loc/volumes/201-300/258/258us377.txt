Syllabus.

The original petition was filed June 1, 1916, but an
amended and supplemental petition was filed on February 12, 1919. The findings of fact indicate that the itemsproved may include some transportation furnished as
late as December 31, 1917. They do not disclose whetherthe transportation of coast guards was. furnished before
or after the declaration of war.on April 6, 1917. Appellant has moved that the case be'remanded to the Court
of Claims with directions, among other things, to find
the facts in this respect. For that purpose and to that
extent the motion to remand is granted, with direction to
enter judgment for appellant for such part of the item of
$252.70, if any, as represents transportation of coast
guards furnished before the declaration- of war., Except
as it may be so modified, the decision of the Court of
Claims is correct.
Motion to remand granted with directions to make a
new finding of fact and,modify the judgment, if need
be, to accord with this opinion.
MR.JUSTICE CLARKE took no part in the decision of
this case.

APPEAL from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
reversing an order of the District Court, which granted an
interlocutory injunction, and directing that the injunction
be dissolved and the bill dismissed for want of jurisdiction, in a suit by the appellant to restrain the appellee
from following certain rules of car distribution, and to
require it to furnish cars upon another basis.
Mr. Frank E. Harkness and Mr. Rush C. Butler, with
whom Mr. Ernest"S. Ballard and Mr. Herbert Pope were
on the briefs, for appellant.
Mr. A. G. Outheim and Mr. R. V. Fletcher,with whom
Mr. Hugh L. Bond, Jr., and Mr. W. S. Bronson were on
the brief, for appellee.
Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Blackburn Esterline, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, by leave
of court, filed a brief on behalf of the United States, as
amici curiae.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
The distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage
has been a fertile field of controversy. The subject has
received much attention from Congress, the Interstate
Commerce Commission and the courts. Definite rules
for distribution were promulgated by the Commission;
and they remained in force for many years. Among these

was the so-called assigned car rule declared by the Commission in Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 12 I. C. C. 398, and Traer v. Chicago & Alton
R. R. Co., 13 I. C. C. 451, and sustained by this court in
Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R.
Co., 215 U. S. 452.' As an incident of the war this rule
was modified by the Rt;ilroad Administration acting in
conjunction with the Fuel Administration; and the assignment of cars for railroad fuel was abandoned. When
by the Transportation Act, 1920, provision was made for
restoring ttie railroads to private control, § 1 of the Act to
Regulate Commerce was amended, among other things,
by inserting a paragraph numbered 12, which deals specifically with the distribution of coal cars. Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, § 402, 41 Stat. 456, 476.
In June, 1920, the Lambert Run Coat Company, a West
Virginia corporation, which owns and operates a mine in
that State, brought, in the Circuit Court of Marion
County, this suit against the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
Company, a Maryland corporation. The bill alleged that
there was an acute car shortage; that the railroad had
refused to make the distribution required by paragraph 12
of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce and in violation
thereof distributed cars in accordance with its own rules
8, 9 and 10, set out in the margin,' and that this course
was resulting in irreparable injury to plaintiff. The bill

prayed that the railroad be restrained from observing
these rules and that it be required to furnish cars in accordance with the established ratings.
-' The defendant removed the case to the federal court
for the Northern District of West Virginia and there filed
-in a single pleading a motion to dismiss and an answer.
1\. grounds for the motion it alleged that the case was not
o1e within the jurisdiction of the state court; that, since
it did not appear that the Commission had taken any action in respect to the matter complained of, neither court
had jurisdiction of the controversy; that the plaintiff had
concealed the fact that the rules of the carrier complained
of were, as plaintiff knew, rules which had been promulgated by the Commission; that the bill was thus one to restrain enforcement of an order of the Commission; and
,that the United States and the Commission were indispensable parties. The answer set forth the facts supporting
these allegations and, among other things, that the rules
promulgated by the Commission and adopted by the carrier had been issued on April 15, 1920, in pursuaice of the
emergency provision known as paragraph 15, inserted in
§ 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce by the Tiansportation Act, 1920, supra, 41 Stat. 456, 476.
Plaintiff then moved in the District Court for an interlocutory injunction. The defendant, insisting that the
451, will be designated as 'assigned' cars. All other cars will be
designated as 'unassigned' cars.
"9. If the number of assigned cars placed at a mine during. Zny
period, as provided in Rule 6, equals or exceeds the mine's pro rata
share of the available car supply, it shall not be entitled to any unassigned cars. The assigned cars, together with the mine's requirements, will be eliminated, and the remainder of the available car
supply pro rated to the other mines, based .on a rivised percentage
by reason of such elimination.
" 10. If the number of assigned cars placed at a mine during any
period, as provided in Rule 6, is less than its pro rata share, based
on a revised percentage, it shall be entitled to receive unassigned
cars in addition thereto to make up its pro rata share."

Opinion of the Court.

proceeding was one to stay an'order of the Commission,
objected to a consideration of the motion in the absence
of two other judges as provided by Act of October 22,
1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, Both this objection and the
motion to dismiss were overruled by the istrict Judge;
and an interlocutory injunction in accordance with the
prihyer of the bill was issued. 'From this order defendant
appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit. That court stayed the injunction pending the
determination of the appeal; and later reversed the decree below with directiohs to dissolve the injunction and
dismiss the bill. 267 Fed. 776. The reasons given by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for its decision are, in substance,
that the car' distribution rule complained of appeared on
uncontroverted facts to be that prescribed by the order
of the Commission issued April 15, 1920; that this Order
was issued under paragraph 15 of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce; that it wa within the emergency powers
there conferred; that the rights and duties prescribed by
paragraph 12 of that section were not absolute, but were
subject to suspension or modification by the Commission
in case of emergency, as provided in paragraph 15; and
that, therefore, the bill should have been dismissed. It
added that the District Court erred in issuing the injunction for the further reason that, since the relief sought
was to enjoin an order of the Commission, it could be
granted only by a court of three judges.
The decree of the District Court was properly reversed;,
but we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals
had no occasion to pass upon the merits of the controversy and that the direction should have been to dismiss
the bill for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice.
The rule of the railroad here complained of was that prescribed by the Commission. To that rule the railroad was
bound to conform unless relieved by the Commission or
enjoined from complying with it by decree of a ourt having jurisdiction. By this suit such a decree was in effect

sought. The appellate court was therefore correct in
holding that in such a suit an injunction of the District
Court could be granted only by three judges.
but there are in addition two fundamental objections
to the jurisdiction. First, the United States, an indispeniable party to suits to restrain or set aside orders of the
Commission, was not joined, and could not be, for it has
not consented to be sued in state courts. Secondly, such
suits are required to be brought in a federal District Court.
Judicial Code, §§ 208, 211; Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32,
38 Stat. 208, 219. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State
Public Uiilitie.s Commission, 245 U. S. 493, 504; North
Dakota -v Chicago & Northwestern.Ry. Co., 257 U. S. 485;
Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission,ante, 158. The
fact thai this was a suit to set aside an order of the Commission did not appear on the face of the bill; but it became apparent as soon as the motion io dismiss was filed.
Jurisdiction cannot be effectively acquired by concealing
for a time the facts which conclusively establish that it
does not exist. As the state court Was without jurisdiction over either the subject-matter or the United States,
the District Court could not acquire jurisdiction over
them by the removal. The jurisdiction of the federal
court on removal is, in a limited sense, a derivative jurisdiction. If the state court lacks jurisdiction of the subject-matter or of the parities, the federal court acquires
none, although it might in a like suit originally. brought
there have had jurisdiction. Courtney v. Pradt, 196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

cases like Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., 237 U. S.479,
relied upon by appellant, have no application. For, while
it is true that a plaintiff by his first pleading determines
what right he will sue" on and that the defenses, set up
either anticipatorily by him or in due course by the defendant, can not affect the jurisdiction when it depends
on that right, yet the plaintiff may not, by alleghig a
frivolous claim or a fictitious situation, confer upon a
court jurisdiction which, as determined by the plaintiff's
real cause of action, it has not. The Fair v. Kohler Die
Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25. And the vital interest of the United
States was one which the plaintiff could neither ignore nor
prejudice by indirection. Compare International Postal
Supply Co. v. Bruce, 194 U. S. 601; Naganab v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 473; Goldberg v. Daniels, 231 U. S. 218;
Louisianav. McAdoo, 234 U. S. 627. The District Court
should therefore have dismissed the bill as soon as it became apparent that the suit was one to set aside an order
of the Commission. Robinson v. Anderson, 121 U. S.
522; Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. PacificBridge Co., 185
U. S. 282, 287; Devine v. Los Angeles, 202 U. S.313, 338.
And the Circuit Court of Appeals in remanding the cause
to the District Court should have directed a dismissal for
want of jurisdiction and without prejudice.
Decree modified and affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE CLRKE took no part in the decision of this
case.
