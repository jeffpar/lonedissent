mitted recovery of the penalty, its judgment was necessarily reversed.
Here there is no question of conflict between a state
statute and any federal policy; and nothing in the words
of the amendment indicates a legislative purpose to abrogate the accepted common-law doctrine concerning presumption. The suggestion that by imposing additional
liability upon the initial carrier the amendment provides
an adequate remedy for shippers and thereby removes the
necessity for any presumption against the terminal one
and impliedly abrogates the rule, is unsound. There are
adequate reasons why shippers should have the benefit of
both; and we think Congress so intended.
The judgment of the court below is
Affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JuSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
Most of the congressional land-grant acts provide that
railroads so aided shall be "free from toll or other charge
upon the transportation of any property or troops of the
United States." Two of the lines of railroad forming part
of the Louisville and Nashville system were built with the
aid of such grants. For all transportation to which that
provision applies, the rates payable by the Government
are now fixed at fifty per cent. of those charged private
persons. See United States v. Uiion Pacific R. R. Co.,
249 U. S. 354.. The company brought this suit in the
Court of Claims to recover the balance of the full rate.
alleging that .the auditors and the Comptroller of the
Treasury had erred in applying the land-grant rates to
transportation of certain officers and men who were not
"troops" of the United States, although in its service.
That court dismissed the petition, 55 Ct. Clms. 45; and the
case is here on appeal.
The persons transported were of ten different classes.
Whether nine of these classes fall within the designation
of "troops" we need not consider; as bills for their transportation had been rendered by the caprier and payment
therefor had been accepted under conditions which, on the
findings made by the lower court, preclude further claim.

States, 255 U. S. 339; Western Pacific R. R. Co. v. United
States, 255 U. S. 349. There remains for our consideration the item of $252.70 alleged to be due for transportation of coast guards.
The Coast Guard was established by Act of January 28,
1915, c. 20, 38 Stat. 800, in lieu of the then existing Revenue-Cutter Service and Life-Saving Service, and was composed of those organizations. The Revenue-Cutter Service had been considered a civil service, 15 Ops. Atty.

Gen. 396; 16 Ops. Atty. Gen. 288; 8 Comp. Dec. 852; 15
Comp. Dec. 807. But to its primary function of an armed
police force some characteristics of a military force kad
always been attached; and from time to time Congress
had conferred upon it additional incidents of the military
service.' See 28 Ops. Atty. Gen. 543, 547; 30 Ops. Atty.
Gen. 75. When the Coast Guard was established it was
constituted "a part of the military forces of the United
States "; and § 1 provides that it "shall operate under
the Treasury Department in time of peace and operate as
a part of the Navy, . . . in time of war or when the
President shall so direct. When subject to the Secretary
of the Navy in time of war the expense vf the Coast
Guard shall be paid by the Navy Department." Congress further manifested its intention to class the Coast
Guard with the Army, Navy and Marine Corps by the
provisions of the Acts of August 29, 1916 c. 417, 39 Stat.
556, 600, 601, and c. 418, § 1, 39 Stat. 619, 649.
The military force of the United States is, and always
has been a unit, although divided for purposes of administration into several branches; and there is nothing in the
land-grant acts to indicate an intention on the part of
Congress to differentiate between the several branches in
respect to transportation charges. We are of opinion that
the term "troops" is not confined to land forces, and
that it includes men and officers in every branch. Since
those in the Navy and Marine Corps are to be deemed
troops within the meaning of those acts, members of the
Coast Guard should also be deemed such when serving
as part of the Navy. But at other times members of the
Coast Guard are not troops; for then it operates under,
and at the expense of, the Treasury Department.

Syllabus.

The original petition was filed June 1, 1916, but an
amended and supplemental petition was filed on February 12, 1919. The findings of fact indicate that the itemsproved may include some transportation furnished as
late as December 31, 1917. They do not disclose whetherthe transportation of coast guards was. furnished before
or after the declaration of war.on April 6, 1917. Appellant has moved that the case be'remanded to the Court
of Claims with directions, among other things, to find
the facts in this respect. For that purpose and to that
extent the motion to remand is granted, with direction to
enter judgment for appellant for such part of the item of
$252.70, if any, as represents transportation of coast
guards furnished before the declaration- of war., Except
as it may be so modified, the decision of the Court of
Claims is correct.
Motion to remand granted with directions to make a
new finding of fact and,modify the judgment, if need
be, to accord with this opinion.
MR.JUSTICE CLARKE took no part in the decision of
this case.
