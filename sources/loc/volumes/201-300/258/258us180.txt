delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is an appeal from a final decree entered October
19, 1920, which enjoined the enforcement of c. 125, Laws
of New York of 1906, and also the Act of New York Legislature approved May 9, 1916, c. 604, Laws of 1916. 268
Fed. 143. The first of these statutes fixed the price which
appellee might charge for gas distributed in New York
City at $1.00 per thousand cubic- feet, and the second
amended the earlier one by reducing the maximuih price
to eighty cents.

TIOWAT v. KANSAS.
180.

Syllabus.

The original bill filed in May, 1920, alleges that the actual cost to appellee of manufacturing and distributing
gas during 1919 and the first three months of 1920 had
exceeded eighty cents per thousand cubic feet; that such
cost would not be less than $1.00 for an indefinite period
thereafter; and that the. statutory rate was confiscatory.
The matter was referred to a Master who took proof
and made a report which supported appellee's claim.
With some unimportant modifications this was confirmed
by the court. An appropriate decree followed which we
are asked to reverse for sundry specified reasons commented upon orally and in the brief.
We are satisfied that the court below reached a correct
conclusion and that none of the points relied upon for
reversal are adequate to justify such action. So far as
substantial all were adequately disposed of by the opinion
of the trial court, and we need not comment further upon
them.
The judgment below is
Affirmed.

Argued February 27, 28, 1922.-Decided March
13, 1922.

1. The constitutionality of a' state statute presenting very important.
questions should not be decided unless the case before the court so

requires. P. 184.
2. Whether the Kansas Industrial Relations-Act (Laws 1920, c. 29),
in providing in effect for compulsory arbitration of labor controversies in certain industries before an administrative body-whose
orders it makes reviewable and enforceable through the State
Supreme Court, violates the Federal Constitution, is not deterruinable upon a review of a judgment of that court sustaining, as
a separable feature of the act,,the power it gives the administrative
body to call witiletses to testify in a general investigation of indus-.
