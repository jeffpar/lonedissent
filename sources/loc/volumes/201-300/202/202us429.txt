MILLARD v. ROBERTS.
APPEAL FROM

THE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE

DISTRICT

OF

COLUMBIA.
No. 234.

Argued April 18, 1006.-Decided May 21, 1906.

Revenue bills, within the meaning of the constitutional provision that they
must originate in the House of Representatives and not in the Sen'ate
are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word and are not'bills
for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue.
An act of Congress appropriating money to be paid to railway companies
to carry out a scheme of public improvements in the District of Columbia,
and which also requires those companies to eliminate grade crossings and
erect a union station, and recognizes and provides for the surrende'r of
existing rights, is an act appropriating money for governmental purposes
and not for the private use exclusively of those companies.
The acts of Congress of February 12, 1901, 31 Stat. 767, 774, and'of February 28, 1903, 32 Stat. 909, for eliminating grade crossings of railways
and erection of a union station in the District of Columbia and providing
for part of the cost thereof by appropriations to be levied and assessed
on property in the District other tian that of the United States 'are not
unconstitutional either because as bills for raising revenue they should
have originated in the House of Representatives and not in the Senate,
or because they appropriate moneys to be paid to the railway companies
for their exclusive use; and assuming but not deciding that lie can'
raise the question by suit, a taxpayer of the District is not oppressed or
deprived of his property without due process of law by reason of the taxes
imposed under said statutes.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Josiah Millard, pro se, appellant:
Taxes on land or the profits issuing from lands are taxes in
the strict sense of the word: they are direct taxes within the
meaning of the constitutional provision respecting the apportionment of representatives and direct taxes, and, therefore,
also necessarily within the meaning of the provision that all bills
for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429;

The chief characteristic of an act which lays a tax for any
purpose whatever, is, that it is intended to raise revenue by
taxation; and no other purpose, pretended or real, can deprive it of the nature of a bill for raising revenue. Bills which
lay taxes on lands or incomes for any purpose whatever are

States v. Realty Co., 163 U. S. 440, 444, the Sugar Bounty case,
is no precedent here, even if these taxes were designed to pay
a debt, and not provide uno flatu a bountyfor a private corporation and a stately edifice for the adornment of the capital
of the nation, as such. The cases above cited sustain this contention.
The right of taxation can only be used in aid of a public
object, an object which is within the purposc for which governments are established, and cannot, therefore, be exercised in
aid of enterprises strictly private, even though, in a remoue or
collateral way, the local public may be benefited thereby.

It is admitted by the Court of Appeals t hat all three of the
acts in question originated in the Senate; and the same fact
also appears affirmatively by reference to the Congressional
Record.
A literal compliance with the mandatory provisions of the
Constitution, whether affirmative or negative, is a condition
precedent to the validity of any law laying taxes on the property of the people, and attempts to evade those provisions constitute violations of them. Wilkes County v. Coler, 180 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

This court has repeatedly held that, although railroad corporations are private corporations as distinguished from those
created for municipal and governmental purposes, their uses
are public. N. Y. & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Bristol, 151 U. S. 556,
571.
The power of States, counties and municipalities to aid in
the construction of railroads, upon the ground that railroads
are quasi public institutions created and existing for the benefit of the public at large, is well established. Olcott v. Supervisors, 16 Wall. 698; Curtis v. County of Butler, 24 How. 447,

The United States possesses complete jurisdiction, both of a
political and municipal nature, over the District of Columbia.
When Congress, acting as the municipal legislature of said District, in the exercise, of the police power, enacts legislation for
the benefit of the health and safety of the community and
makes an appropriation and levies an assessment to carry said
legislation into effect, the propriety of its action is not open to
review by the courts. Wight v: Davidson,, 181 U. S. 371, 381;
Wilson v. Lambert, 168 U. S. 611; N. Y. & N. E. R. R. Co...v.
Bristol, 151 U. S. 556. See also Wabash R. R. Co. v. Defiance,

But even if the appropriations made by the acts of 1901 and
1903 could be regarded as donations they would still be legal
and the acts providing therefor constitutional and valid.
From the beginning of this Government, Congress has made
donations for the benefit of public service corporations, in the
nature of land grants, subsidies and bounties, and such donations have been invariably sustained. Allen v. Smith, 1,73 U. S.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

Said acts of 1901 and 1903 are not revenue or tax measures
in the sense contemplated by the Constitution.
The provisions of section 7, article I of the Constitution,
which requires that "all bills for raising revenue shall originate
in the House of Representatives," cannot apply to any of the
acts involved in this case, even if we should adnit for the purposes of the argument that said acts did originate in the Senate
instead of in the House of Representatives.
By "bills" is meant "money bills. " Story's Constitution,
ยง874. In practice it is applied to bills to levy taxes in the
strict sense of the word. 2 Elliott's Debates, 283, 284; Story's
Constitution, ยง 880.
Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U. S. 196, is decisive of the
question.
The act of February 28, 1903, from the recitals in its enacting
clause and the fact that it has received the approval of the
President and has been regularly enrolled among the statutes
of the United States, must be presumed to have been passed
by Congress in strict accord with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, and resort cannot be had to the journals of the
two houses to overthrow this presumption. Field v. Clark, 143
U. S. 649, 680; Harwood v.. Wentworth, 162 U. S. 547, 562;

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity to enjoin Ellis H. Roberts, as Treasurer
of the United States, from paying to any person any moneys
of the District of Columbia, under certain acts of Congress'
'An act entitled "An act to provide for eliminating certain grade crossings of railroads in the District. of Columbia, to require and authorize the
construction of new terminals and tracks for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in the city of Washington, and for other purposes," approved February 12, 1901; an act entitled "An act to provide for eliminating certain grade crossings on the line of the Baltimore and Potomac
Railroad Company, in the city of Washington, D. C., and requiring said
company to depress and elevate its tracks, and to enable it to relocate

(31 Stat. 767, 774; 32 Stat. 909), and to enjoin the other dofendants from carrying into effect said acts of Conhgress,.,and
that said acts "be declared null and void for want of constitulional authority." " Defendants interposed demurrers to the
bill, which were sustained by the Supreme Court, and a decree
entered dismissing the bill. The Court of Appeals affirmed the
decree.
The principal allegations of the bill are that the railroad
defendants are private corporations and all interested in the.
railway and terminal facilities of the District of Columbia;
that the District of Columbia owns no stock in any of the companies nor is otherwise interested in any of them save as useful,
private enterprises, and yet it is required by said acts, "without any lawful consideration therefor," to pay the Baltimore
and Potomac Railroad Company the sum of $750,000, and
a like sum to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroa( Company, "to
be levied and assessed upon the taxable property and l)rivileges
in the said District other than the property of the United
States and the District of Columbia," and for the exclusiveuse of said corporations . respectively, "which is a private use,'
and not a governmental use;" that the public moneys of the
District of Columbia are raised chiefly by taxation on the lands
therein, anti that the complainant is obliged to pay and does
pay directtaxes on land owned by him therein. And the bill
also alleges that the acts of Congress are "acts which provide
for .raising revenue and are repugnant to article I, section 7,
clause 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and are,
therefore, null and void ab initio, and to their entire extent,,
because they and each and every one of them originated in
the Senate and not in the House of Representatives." Certain
volumes of the Congressional Record are referred to. and made,
part of the bill.
parts of its railroad therein, and for. other purposes," approved February
12, 1901; an act entitled "An act to provide for a-:union railroad station
in the District of Columbia and for other purposes," approved February28, 1903.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

In other allegations of the bill are expressed the limitations
upon the power of the United States and the District of Columbia as to taxation; that the acts of Congress complained
of are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States; that
public funds are appropriated for private use, and that exorbitant taxes will be required to meet the legitimate expenses of
the District of Columbia, and appellant will thereby be oppressed and deprived of his property without due process of
law.
The first contention of appellant is that the acts of Congress
are revenue measures, and therefore should have originated in
the House of Representatives and not in the Senate, and to
sustain the 'contention appellant submits an elaborate argument. In answer to the contention the, case of Twin City
Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U. S. 196, need only be cited. It was
observed there that it was a part of wisdom not to- attempt
to cover by a general statement what bills shall be said to be
"bills for raising revenue" within the meaning of those words
in the Constitution, but it was said, quoting Mr. Justice Story,
"that the practical construction of the Constitution and the
history of the Origin of the constitutional provision in question
proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict'
sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes, which
miay incidentally create revenue." 1 Story on Constitution,
ยง 880. And the act of Congress which was there passed on
illustrates the meaning of the language used. The act involved
was one providing a national currency, and imposed a tax upon
the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circulation. The 'provision was assailed for unconstitutionality because it originated in the Senate. The provision was stustained, this court saying:
"The tax was a means for effectually accomplishing the great
object of giving to the people a currency that would rest,
primarily, upon the honor of. the United States and be available
in every, part -of the country. There was no purpose, by the
act or by any of its provisions, to raise revenue to be applied

MILLARD v. ROBERTS.
202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court:

ijnmeeting the expenses or obligations of the Government."
This language is applicable to the acts of Congress in the case
at bar. Whatever taxes are ilposed are but means to the
purposes provided by the act.
The legality of those purposes is attacked in the other contentions of appellant. All of the contentions rest upon the
correctness of the allegation that the moneys provided to be
paid to the railroad companies are for the exclusive use of the
companies, "which is a private use and not a governmental use."
The titles of the acts are the best brief summary of their
purposes, and those purposes are obviously of public benefit.
We do not think that it is necessary to enter into a discussion
of the cases which establish this. The scheme of improvement
provided by the acts required a removal of the railroads from
their situations, large expenditures of money by the companies,
and the surrender of substantial rights. These rights are
recognized and their surrender expressed to be part of the consideration of the sums of money paid to the companies. Indeed there is an element of contract not only in the changes
made but in the manner and upon the scale which they are
required to be made. As remarked by Mr. Justice Morris,
speaking for the Court of Appeals:
"The case is practically that of a contract between the
United States and the District of Columbia on the one side
and the railroad companies on the other, whereby the-railroad
companies agree to surrender certain rights, rights of property
as well as other rights, and to construct a work of great magnitude, greater perhaps than their own needs require, but which
Congress deems to be demanded for the best interest of the
national capital and by the public at large; and for this surrender of right and this work of magnitude commensurate with
the public demand, Congress agrees to pay a certain sum, partly
out of the funds of the United States and partly out of the
funds of the District of Columbia. It is a simple case of bargain and sale, like any other purchase."

The duty of the master to furnish safe places for the employds to work

wherever circumsthnces require it.
While the duty of the master--in this case a railroad company-may be,
and frequently is, discharged by one exercise it may recur at any moment
in keeping trains in safe relation. A train dispatcher is not relieved,
nor does he relieve the company, by the promulgation of an order; he
must at all times know and guard against possible changes, and, under
the circumstances of this case, held that a collision causing injuries to an
engineer was the result of the dispatcher's negligence in failing to take
into account and do what a prudent man would have taken into account
and done.
In this case the dispatcher was the representative of the company topromulgate orders for the running of trains and not a fellow servant of the
