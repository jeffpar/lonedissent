PEARSON v. 'WILLIAMS.
Statement of the Case.

202 U. S.

Nor was a right under the Constitution of the United States
necessarily involved in the determination of the cause. And
the Supreme Court was justified by its rulings in omitting the
consideration of rights under the 'Constitution of the United
States. According to the practice of the court an' error not
assigned is not open to review. Berry v. City of Chicago, 192
Illinois, 154, 155. Errors assigned but not noticed or relied on
in the brief or argument of counsel will be regarded as waived
or abandoned. Keyes v. Kimmel, 186 Illinois, 109, 114. And
such rule of practice will be recognized by this court. Erie
Railroad Co. v. Purdy, 185 U. S. 148, 153. It follows that this
court has not jurisdiction of this writ of error. Oxley Stave
Co. v. Butler Co., 166 U. S. 648; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio,

TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 237.

Argued April 19, 20, 1906.-Decided May 14, 1906.

The Secretary of Commerce and Labor, has a right under § 21 of the act
of. March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1218, to order the deportation of an alien as
having come to this country under contract to perform labor, after a
second hearing before a board of special inquiry, although there had
previously been a special inquiry, pursuant to § 25 of the act at the time
of his landing before the same persons, and upon the same questions, and
he had been allowed to land
The board of inquiry tinder § 25 of the act of 1903 is neb~a court, but an
instrument of the executive power, and its decisions do not constitute
res judicata in a technical sense.

Mr. Eugene Treadwell for petitioners.
Mr. Charles H. Robb, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This case comes here by certiorari. 198 U. S. 585. It is a
writ of habeas corpus, addressed to the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor and to the Commissioner of Immigration of the Port
of New York, on which the Circuit Court made an order discharging the petitioners, but the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order by a divided court. 136 Fed. Rep. 734. The
return to the writ discloses that the petitioners are British
aliens, that they arrived in New York on February 1, 1904,
were detained for examination by a board of special inquiry,
were examined and were allowed to land. The return further
shows that afterwards, in March, they were arrested by order
of the said Secretary and after another hearing before a board
of special inquiry were ordered to be returned to England, as
being in this country in violation of the acts of Congress touching the matter. The only question is whether the Secretary
had the right to direct the second hearing and to make the
order of deportation under §21 of the act of March 3, 1903,
c. 1012, when there had been an inquiry at the time of the
petitioners' landing and a decision in their favor tinder §25,
32 Stat. 1218, 1220. It is proper to add, as giving more draniatic force to the contention of the petitioners, that the proceedings upon both inquiries are incorporated into the return
by reference and that they appear to have been before the
samo persons, upon the same question, namely, whether the
petitioners came to this country under contract. to perform
labor contrary to the statutes of the United States. Act of

Stat. 569; August 18, 1894, c. 301, 28 Stat. 372, 390.
It is provided by § 24 of the above mentioned act of 1903
that "every alien who may not appear to the examining immigrant inspector at the port of arrival to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land shall be detained for examination in relation thereto by a board of special inquiry." The
following 'section, § 25, directs the appointment of such boards
as shall be necessary for the prompt determination of cases of
aliens detained, to consist of three members to be selected from
the immigrant officials in the service. "Such boards shall have
authority to determine whether an alien who has:been duly
held shall be allowed to land or be deported." They are to
keep records, "and the decision of any two members of a board
shall prevail and be final," subject to appeal by the alien or
a dissenting member "throfigh the Commissioner of Immigration at the port of arrival and the Commissioner General of
Immigration, to the Secretary of the Treasury," (now the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, act of February 14, 1903,
c. 552, §§ 4, 7, 10, 32 Stat. 826, 828, 829), whose decision shall
then be final." In this case the first decision of the board
was unanimous, and the petitioners contend that it was final
by the very words of the act.
On the other hand it is provided by § 21 "That in case the
Secretary of the Treasury shall be satisfied that an alien has
been found in the United States in violation of this act he
shall cause such alien, within the period of three years after
landing or entry therein, to be taken into custody and returned
to the country whence he came," with details as to the method.
It is insisted by the Government that this power is not qualified or cut down by § 25. Of course if the Government is
right on the construction of the act, there is no question of the
validity of the provision. By that construction the finality
given to the decision of the board is only a finality consistent
with and subject to § 21, as, conversely, by that contended for
on the other side, the power of the Secretary is subject to § 25.

On the former view the United States admits aliens conditionally, and preserves that condition notwithstanding a preliminary decision in their favor by a board which it provides. The
authority of Congress to impose such. conditions hardly was
disputed and is not open to doubt. Lem Moon Sing v. United
States, 158 U. S. 538, 543; Ekiu v. United States, 142 U. S. 651;
Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86, 97, 99. Tihe only
question is what it has done.
Some meaning must be found for § 21, no less than for § 25.
For the petitioners it is said that §21 is satisfied by confining
the power of the Secretary to cases where a board of special
inquiry has not acted. But this would limit his action to a
very narrow scope, since the act provides for such a board in
every case where the alien does not appear to the inspector
"to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land." Section 24, quoted above. Again it would defeat in great measure the policy of the original act of October 19, 1888, c.1210,
§1, 25 Stat. 566 (see also actof March 3, 1891, c. 551, § 11, 26
Stat. 1086), which obviously was to give a chance for fuller investigation than is possible at the moment of landing, when any
inquiry necessarily must be of a very summary sort. See Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S.86, 99. Yet this policy is
emphasized and reinforced by changing the period of probation
-from one year to three, while in other respects § 21 follows
alrhost literally the words of the earlier act. The petitioners'
construction also would empty the requirement in § 20 that
"any alien who shall come into the United States in violation
of law" shall be deported, of the greater part of its natural
meaning, since it would limit it to such aliens only as appeared
to the inspector to' be entitled beyond a doubt to land and
for that reason escaped a board of special inquiry before they
came in.
Turning now to §25, that section seems to us to disclose
additional reasons on the Government's side. The board is an
instrument of the executive power, not a court. It is made
up, as we have mentioned, of the'immigrant officials in the

service, subordinates of the Commissioner of Immigration,
whose duties are declared to be administrative by § 23. Decisions of a similar type long have been recognized as decisions
of the executive department, and cannot constitute res judicata
in a technical sense. Ekiu v. United States, 142 U. S. 651;
Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 713; Lem Moon
Sing v. United States, 158 U. S. 538; Fok Yung Yo v. United
States, 185 U' S. 296, 305; Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S.
86, 98; United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253, 263. The
decisions necessarily are made, as we have said, in a summary
way, in order to reach the "prompt determination" declared
by § 25 to be an object. The board has. no power to compel
witnesses to attend, but, as was said by the Circuit Court of
Appeals, must decide upon such evidence as is at hand or is
readily accessible. These are considerations against the likelihood that Congress meant such decisions to be binding upon
the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, the superior officer of
the members of the board. On the other hand, there is a plain
and sufficient meaning for the words making their decision
final-and that is that it shall be final where it is most likely
to be questioned, in the courts.
It is true that the decision hardly will be questioned in the
courts except when it is against the right to land. In the earlier acts the decision of an inspector was.made final, in terms,
only "when adverse to such right." Act of March 3, 1891,
c. 551, § 8, 26 Stat. 1085. Since then, it is said, Congress has
gone on increasing the importance of the decision, first, by
providing a board in cases of doubt, with a limited appeal, act
of March 3, 1893, c. 206, § 5, 27 Stat. 569, 570, and then by
enlarging the right of appeal and extending the finality of the
ultimate decision to every case, by the present § 25. But this
appears to us to strain and even pervert the conclusions to be
drawn from the change. There can be no doubt, we think,
that the provision of the act of 1891 referred to the courts.
The adverse decision of an inspector would be followed by deportation unless that should be stopped by habeas corpus. To

prevent a retrial in that event the provision was passed. It is
not likely that the purpose was changed when the words "when
adverse to such right" were dropped. More probably they
were omitted simply as superfluous. If the question ever could
arise in the courts, except when the alien was ordered to be
deported, there was no reason why the decision to admit should
not be given an effect equal to that of a decision to exclude.
If the question could arise only in the former case there was
no need of the omitted clause. But the matter which was before the mind of Congress presumably was that which had been
before it on the former occasion, which had been the subject
of judicial discussion, Lein Moon Sing v. United States, 158
U. S. 538; Fok Yung Yo v. United States, 185 U. S. 296, 304,
305, and which was not quite disposed of until the last term
of this court. United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253.
There Was a suggestion at the argument that the decision
*of the Secretary was not warranted by the evidence. But if,
for the purposes of decision, we assume that question to be
open, we do not think that it needs discussion. We are of
opinion that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was
right.
Judgment affirmed.
