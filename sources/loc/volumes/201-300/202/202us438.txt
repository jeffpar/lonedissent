CIRCUIT.

Argued April 18, 19, 1906,-Decided May 21, 1906.

The duty of the master to furnish safe places for the employds to work
in and safe appliances to work with is a continuing one to be exercised
wherever circumsthnces require it.
While the duty of the master--in this case a railroad company-may be,
and frequently is, discharged by one exercise it may recur at any moment
in keeping trains in safe relation. A train dispatcher is not relieved,
nor does he relieve the company, by the promulgation of an order; he
must at all times know and guard against possible changes, and, under
the circumstances of this case, held that a collision causing injuries to an
engineer was the result of the dispatcher's negligence in failing to take
into account and do what a prudent man would have taken into account
and done.
In this case the dispatcher was the representative of the company topromulgate orders for the running of trains and not a fellow servant of the
engineer.

caused by the negligence of a fellow servant. The action was
tried without. a jury, and the Circuit Court found for defendant in error in the amount of $9,000, and entered judgment
akainst the company for that sum. The judgment was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 136 Fed. Rep. 66. The
company, being a Federal corporation, then sued out this
writ of error.
The colliding trains were regular passenger trains, and are
denominated in the testimony as train No. 3 and train No. 4,
the former being westbound and the latter eastbound. Defendant in error was the engineer on No. 4, or rather one of
the engineers, the train being hauled by two engines. He
was the engineer of the second engine. Both trains were run
on regular schedule or time cards, when on time or slightly
delayed, No. 4 having the right of track. On the morning of
the collision, November 20, 1901, train No. 3 was unusually
delayed, and special orders became necessary for the operation of the trains on the Arizona division. The first order was
issued before train No. 4 had left Needles. The order was as
follows: "No. 3 eng. 482 has right of track over No. 4 eng.
444 and 452 to Needles, but will run 1 hour 50 minutes late
Kingman to Needles." The copy of the order was delivered
to train No. 4 before- 4.22 A. Mi., before its departure from
Needles, and to No. 3 upon its arrival at Kingman at 4.21
or 4.22 A. M. Train No. 4 ran east to Mellen, a distance of
11.9 miles, where it stopped upon ..signal. In the meantime
the second order (No. 23) was issued by the train dispatcher,
train No. 3 having been more delayed in arriving at Kingman than had been expected.0 This order was delivered to
train No. 4 at Mellen. It read as follows: "No. 3 eng. .482
will run two (2) hours late Kingman to Needles." A. 6opy of
the order was delivered to No. 3 at Kingman. The effect of
these orders and the general rules of the company was that
No. 3 was to run according to the time card, except that it
was to run two hours late and was to have the right of track
'over No. 4, the latter to look, out for No. 3, and run with refer-

ence to its movement as provided for by the special orders in
connection with the time-table. The orders and the timetable would have made Franconia the proper place of passing of the trains, No. 3 being due to arrive there at 5.17,
,No. 4 at 5.06, or eleven minutes ahead of No. 3. Train
No. 3 should have left Kingman at 4.25. It left at 4.31,
six minutes late. It passed Yucca, however, at 4.55 (this is
disputed, but upon what evidence we shall presently consider),
it should not have passed until 4.57; and it passed Franconia
six minutes ahead of time. The operator at Yucca (the
only night telegraph office between Kingman and Franconia)
at 4.58 or 59 reported to the train dispatcher that No. 3 had
passed at 4.55.
No. 4 left Mellen, which was the only night office between
Needles and Franconia, between 4.45 and 4.47, and ran 6.8
miles to Powell, arriving there at 5 o'clock. A stop was made
of three or four minutes for the purpose of adjusting the flow
of oil in the leading locomotive, and then proceeded towards
Franconia. In the meantime No. 3 had arrived at Franconia
six minutes ahead of the schedule time under the special order
for leaving that station. On approaching the station the
eigineer signalled an inquiry for orders and received by
semaphore signal from the operator the reply: "No orders
from the train dispatcher." He did not stop at Franconia,
and while the train was'going at a speed of from sixty to
seventy miles an hour, about one and one-quarter miles from
Franconia it collided with No. 4, which was running from
forty to fifty miles an hour. Both trains were wrecked, the
engineer of the leading locomotive of No. 4 and several others
were killed, and the defendant in error sustained serious injuries. The operator at Franconia had no orders that morning for either No. 3 or No. 4. But for the collision No. 4
would have reached and have been placed on the siding at
Franconia, notwithstanding the delay at Powell, two :or three
min, tes before No. 3 was due at Franconia. Plaintiff in error's
rule No. 385 only requires the train not having the right of

after stating the case as above,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The case here is in narrow compass both as to the facts and
the law. It is apparent that none of the operators of train
No. 4 was guilty of negligence. The second special order indicated Franconia as the. meeting point of the trains and that
train No. 4 should reach there before 5.17, the leaving time
for train No. 3. This it could have accomplished notwithstanding the delay at Powell. It is equally apparent that
train No. 3 was ahead of time and we may consider that its
engineer was culpable. The question is yet presented whether
the company is not charged with liability. In this question
there are involved two elements, one of law and one of fact.
It is not denied that the train dispatcher represented the compaiy in the promulgation of the special orders. It is, however, asserted that this representation ceased by the proinulgation of the orders and that he was not required to repeat
them or promulgate new ones. "There is no ground," it is
insisted, "either upon reason or authority for holding that a
principal, is bound to stand over his servants to enforce proper
and sufficient orders once given to them." There is an instant. answer to the contention. Instead of according with
pri'cviple and amlhority it is opposed to both. It contradicts
a Iuncession elsewhere made in the argument, that it is the

duty of a railroad company to promulgate adequate rules and.
regulations for the safety of employs engaged in the dangerous
duty of operating trains, and at times telegraph orders for the
movements of trains. It is the duty of a master to furnish
safe places to work in and safe instruments to work with, and
of this there need be no discussion. The duty is a continuing
one and must be exercised whenever circumstances demand
it. It may indeed often be discharged by one exercise. It
may recur at any moment in keeping moving and opposing
trains in safe relation. The rules of the company recognize
this. They require telegraph operators to report the time
of departure and passing of trains. This is absolutely necessary for supervision. The business is hazardous. Trains
may be rushing towards each other upon a single track. All.
may go well. -The observance of time alone may be sufficient
for safety. But something may occur to one of the trains,
with or without fault of anybody, which may endanger the
other. - May a train dispatcher know it and not guard against
it? A negative answer would be revolting.
There can be no doubt of the duty of the train dispatcher
in such case. His duty is clear if the circumstances call for
action. Did the circumstances in the case at bar call for
action? In answering this it will do no good to discuss cases.
The principles of law are clear. A master must furnish a safe
place, for his servant to work in, and the" risk the servant assumes of the negligence or a fellow servant does not exempt
from that duty. Or to put the matter more guardedly, there
is no circumstance in this case which exempted from that
duty. The special orders were an assurance of the company,
through its train dispatcher, to train No. 4, that it could run
with safety between Mellen and Franconia if it arrived at the
latter station before 5.17. If anything occurred to change
that condition which came to the knowledge. of the company
train No. 4 was entitled to know it, and we are brought to the
simple, question, did anything occur? It is admitted all
around that train No. 3 did not comply with, orders and ar-

rived and departed from Franconia ahead of time. It is disputed whether it arrived at or departed from Yucca ahead
of time. Both of the lower courts found that it did, and we
cannot say that the evidence does not sustain the finding.
The telegraph operator at Yucca notified the train dispatcher
that the train passed two minutes ahead of time-passed at
4.55; its time was 4.57; and we know that it passed Franconia
six minutes ahead of time, a circumstance which tends to show
that the operator at Yucca was right. That there was an error
in the operator's clock .was an afterthought of the train dispatcher. He received and recorded on the "train sheet" the
time (4.55) which was given him. He testified (his deposition was taken by defendant in error) that he received the
report of the operator at 4.58, and that he made the entry at
4.55, "just before the accident, and placed '7' over the second
'5' just after. the accident." He was asked no further explanation by either of the parties. The operator (who was
also called by defendant in error) testified that shortly after
he had reported the passing 9 f train No. 3 he was called up
by the train dispatcher, who asked: "What time, have you
got?" The operator gave the time 4.51 or 2, and the' dispatcher replied: "Your clock is two minutes slow," or such
a matter. And this testimony has corroboration in the testimony of the operator at Kingman, who heard the conversation. It appears, therefore, that the attention of the train
dispatcher was challenged: to the fact and felt the importance
of the fact that train No. 3 was running contrary to orders.
What should he have done considering that two trains were
rushing toward each other upon a single track, the safety of
-both dependent upon the exact observance of time by both?
Minutes were important, and how important the testimony
exhibits everywhere. The clocks of the telegraph operators
are adjusted by standard, and not allowed to vary three
seconds. The practice and safety of special orders are recognized as dependent upon the exact observance of time. Their
superiority to meeting points foi trains is attempted to be

demonstrated by witness by saying that "it is one of the
objects of good railroading to cover the greatest distance in
the least time, and to keep in motion the largest number of
trains on a division." The object was beset with dangers and
demanded a proportionate care. It allowed little margin for
inevitable delays. There was no place in it for any negligence. A train was in fault if it was behind time. It was
the height of culpability to be ahead of time. A close connection at "clearance" points was expected. It was testified
that trains of the first class, which No. 3 and No. 4 were,
"can clear each other to a second." If the trains are of
different classes the inferior must clear by at least five minutes.
Such was the s'ystem and what it demanded the train dispatcher must have known. In such a system minutes-and
even seconds-are important, and it is the duty of the train
dispatcher to regard them. He knew, to use the testimony
of the company's chief dispatcher, that it was the duty of
train No. 3 "not to run less than two hours late with reference
to her schedule, as prescribed in the regular time-table." She
was not allowed, was his emphatic declaration, "to make up
one second of that two hours as long as that order was in
effect." She (to keep up the personification of the witness)
was running two minutes ahead of time. This might of itself
have caused a collision. 'The other train was to be considered, and that minutes were important should not have been
out of the train dispatcher's mind an instant. He knew that
No. 3 had the right of way with no obligation to No. 4 but to
observe time. He knew that No. 4,was "to get into the clear
and out of No. 3's way," and had no other guide but the time
prescribed.
These comments do not lose their force or application by
reason of the fact that under the special orders the trains had
an allowaice of eleven minutes at Franconia. This allowance
was made upon the basis of a strict observance of time, the
perfect working of machinery and -exact accordance of clocks.
But such perfection in the nature of things was'liable to dis-

turbance, and when disturbance was observed should have
been provided against, and immediately provided against.
It was no time to take chances or debate probabilities. It is
to be remembered that at all stations there were not night
telegraph offices. Yucca was the only one between Yucca
and Franconia, and between .those stations the train was lost
to observation and control. The train dispatcher indeed
exhibited his" concern. All of the fatal significance of train
No. 3 running ahead of time came to his mind. His mistake
was to account for it by an error in the telegraph operator's
clock (giving to him this excuse against the finding of the
lower courts), although he knew that the clock must have been
adjusted that clay under the rules with the standard time. If
we were forced to find the fat we should find it against him,
but it is enough to say that there was brought to him, considering his position and the responsibilities upon him, a demand
for a care which he omitted to observe. If he had been as
considerate as he ought to have been he would have stopped
No. 3 at Franconia. And for this conclusion we need not
the proof afforded by the collison. The collision, however,
and the excuses offered for it, make the conclusion irresistible.

Plaintiff in error excuses the train dispatcher by a defect in
the clock of the telegraph operator at Yucca. The engineer
of No. 3 excuses himself by virtually condemning the clocks
of the company by which he had tested his watch. He is
sure if No. 4 had been running on time he would have met
her at Haviland, the station between Yucca and Franconia.
A system which permits such confusion and the endangering
or human lives is wrong or wrongly administered. We need
go no farther in the present case than to say that it was wrongly
administered. The train dispatcher failed to take into account and do what a prudent man would have taken into
account and have done.
