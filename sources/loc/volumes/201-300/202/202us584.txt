with the tariff act as then in force." In other words, whether
the treaty went into effect in April or in December was unimportant, being in effect under the act of Congress when
liquidation was made it determined the rate of duty. The
proposition, if true, is decisive and makes all others in the case
valueless. Appellant submits the proposition without other
argument than its statement, and we may, therefore, reply to
it briefly. It is plainly in contradiction of section 20 of the
Customs Administrative Act as amended. That section subjects merchandise to the rate of duty in force at the time of
withdrawal for consumption, not the rate in force at the time
of liquidation. See United States v. Burr, 159 U. S. 78,,83, 84.

Mr. Albert H. Harris, with whom Mr. Ira A. Place And Mr.
Thomas Emery were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The subject matter taxed, as herein complained of, is the use
and exercise of the franchise, privilege and business of transportation of persons and commodities. Ownership or possession of the corporate franchise to be or to do, do not subject
the owner or possessor to the tax.
Notwithstanding the continued existence of the corporation,
and continued existence and possession of -the corporate capacity, powers, faculties and franchises with which it was at
its creation endowed, if none of its capital is employed within
this State during the tax year, section 182 imposes no tax.

Exercise of the franchise is the foundation for imposition of

It is necessary to the power of taxation upon the use and

Taxation of or upon the exercise of the privilege of commerce
conducted in another State, or computed upon the capital
there so employed, whether such commerce be interstate, foreign or intrastate, transcends the jurisdiction of the taxing

therefore, the imposition of the tax was adjudged unauthorized

Absence of congressional regulation of, or restraint or burden
upon, interstate commerce, constitutes no warrant for state
regulation, restraint or burden thereof. Upon like principle,
absence of state regulation of, or restraint. or burden upon,
commerce local to such State, constitutes no warrant for another State to exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction, whereby
to impose such regulation, restraint or burden.
The mere fact that a State grants and continues corporate
life and capacity to a body corporate of its creation, constitutes,
no warrant for taxation by that State of such corporation's
tangible property having its situs beyond the territorial jurisdiction of that State, or of the corporation's capital stock invested in-that property, Del., L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania,

The situs of exercise of the franchise pertaining to transportation upon and over any railroad, is the situs of the railroad,
and of the franchise relating thereto. The corporate franchises
exercised within the State, by domestic surface steam railroad
corporations, are those which the State has granted by charters
authorizing the building and operation of railroads within the
State.
As it is the peculiar and sole province of the United States
to prescribe what burdens the exercise of the business of interstate and foreign commerce shall be subject to, so also, for like
reason and upon like principle, it is the peculiar and sole province of each State to prescribe what burdens the exercise of
the business of its local commerce shall be subject to.

The policy of the courts has been not to disturb the findings
of the assessing officers. No system of taxation can be perfect,
and the courts have realized the practical difficulties with which
assessing officers are so frequently cbnfronted. The reasons
which have led to a conclusion or the methods of computation
have not been inquired into by- appellate courts, unless that
method offends some provision of the statute under consideration or of the state or Federal constitutions. Coulter v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 196 U. S. 599, 610; People ex rel.

As the relator did not pay six per cent upon its stock, it

Even if the legislature of New York determined by section 182

not interfere. State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575.

There being no evidence befQre the comptroller upon which
it could be found what the value was of the rolling stock of the
relator which was claimed to be continuously employed without the State, his finding thereon is correct and was properly
approved by the Appellate Division, anid also by the Court of
Appeals, as a finding of fact upon the evidence presented to
the comptroller. Levis V.Monson, 151 U. S. 545. Such ruling

No Federal question is presented in the several cases under.

however erroneously it may have been determined by the trial
court. In this case the *trial court was the comptroller of the

the plaintiff in error which is shown to have been permanently
or continuously without the State during the tax period.
The statute does hot purport to take, nor has the determination of the comptroller of the State of New York taken, any
of the property of the relator without due process of law.
The plaintiff in error had oppqrtunity to be heard upon the

in error had the right to a writ of certiorari to review the determination of the comptroller, and pursued that. right through
the courts of the State of New York.

to the extent of the value of the property employedby it within
the State of New York.
MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

These cases arise upon writs of certiorari, issu'ed under the
state law and addressed 'to the state comptroller for the time
being, to revise taxes imposed upon the relator for the years
1900, 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1904, respectively. The tax was
levied under New York Laws of 1896, c. 908, ยง 182, which, so
far as material, is as follows: "Franchise Tax on Corporations.-Every corporation . . . incorporated . . . under . . . law in this State,'shall pay to the state treasurer
annually, an annual tax to be computed upon the basis of the.
amount of its capital stock employed within this State and
upon each dollar of such amount," at a certain rate, if the dividends amount to six per cent or more upon the par value of
such capital stock. "If such diyidend or dividends amount to
less than six per centum on the par value of the capital stock
[as was the case with the relator], the tax shall be at the rate
of one and one-half mills upon such portion of the capital stock
at par as the amount of capital employed within this State
bears to the entire capital of the corporation." It is provided
further by the same section that every foreign corporation, etc.,
"shall pay a like tax for the privilege of exercising its corporate
franchises or carrying on its business in such corporate or organized capacity in this State, to be computed upon the basis
of the capital employed by it within this State."
The relator is a New York corporation owning or hiring lines
without as well as within the State, having arrangements with
other carriers for through transportation, routing and rating,
and sending its cars to points without as well as within the
State, and over other lines as well :as its own. The cars often
are ,,ut of the relator's possession for some time, aund may be
transferred to many roads successively, and even may be used
by other roads for their own independent business, before they

return to the relator or the State. In short, by the familiar
course of railroad business a considerable proportion of the
relator's cars constantly is out of the State, and on this ground
the relator contended that that proportion should be deducted
from its entire capital, in order to find the capital stock employed within the State. This contention the comptroller
I
disallowed.
The writ of certiorari in the earliest case, No. 81, with the
return setting forth the proceedings of the comptroller, Knight,
and the evidence given before him, was heard by the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court, and a reduction of ihe amount
of the tax was ordered. 75 App. Div. 169. On appeal the
Court of Appeals ordered the proceedings to be remitted to the
comptroller, to the end that further evidence might be taken
upon the question whether any of the relator's rolling stock
was used exclusively outside of the State, with directions'that
if it should be found that such was the faet the amount of the
rolling stock so used should be deducted. 173 N. Y. 255. On
rehearing of No. 81 and with it No. 82, before the comptroller,
now Miller, no evidence was offered to prove that any of the
relator's cars or engines were used continuously and exclusively outside of the State during the whole tax year. In the
later cases it was admitted that no substantial amount of the
equipment was so used during the -similar period. But in all
of them evidence was offered of the movements of particular
cars, to illustrate the transfers which they went through before
they returned, as has been stated, evidence of the relator's
road mileage outside and inside of the State, and also evidence
of the car mileage outside and inside of the State, in order to
show, on one footing or the other, that a certain proportion of
cars, although not the same cars, was continuously without the
State during the whole tax year. The comptroller refused to
make any reduction of the tax, and the case being taken up
again, his refusal was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court and by the Court of Appeals on the authority
;of the former decision. 89 App. Div. 127; 177 N. Y. 584.

*N. Y. CENTRAL RAILROAD v. MILLER.
202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The later cases took substantially the same course. The relator saved the questions whether the statute as construed was
not contrary to Article 1, ยง8, of the Constitution of the United
States, as to commerce among the States; Article 1, ยง 10,
against impairing the obligation of contracts; Article 4, ยง 1,
as to givifig full faith and credit to the public acts of other
States; and the Fourteenth Amendment. It took out writs of
error and brought the cases here.
The argurient for the relator had woven through it suggestions which only tended to show that the construction of the
New York statute by the Court of Appeals was wrong. Of
course if the statute as construed is valid under the Constitution, we are. bound by the constrction given to it by the state
court. In'this case we are to assunm that the statute purports
and intends to allow no deduction from the capital stock taken
as the basis of the tax, unless sone specific portion of the cor-

porate property is outside of the State during the whole tax
year. We must assume, further, that no part of the corporate
property in question was outside of the State during the whole
tax year, The proposition really was conceded, as we have
said, and the evidence that was offered had no, tendency to
prove the contrary. if we are to suppose that the reports
offered in evidence were accepted as competent to establish
the facts which they set forth, still it would be going a very
great way to infer from car mileage the average number or

proportion of cars absent from the State. For, as was said by
a witness,, thereports show only that the cars made so many
miles, but it might be ten or it inight be fifty cars that made
them. Certainly no inferce whatever could be dra'wn that
the same cars were absent froln the State all the timne.
In view of what we have said it is questionable whether the
relator has offered evidence enough to open the constitutional
objections urged

against the tax.

But as it cannot be

doubted, in view of the well known course of railroad business,
that some consideralle proportion of the relator's cars always
is absent fromi

the State, it would be unsatisfactory to turn the

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

case off with a merely technical answer, and we proceed. The
most salient points of the relator's argument are as follows:
This tax is not a tax on the franchise to be a corporation, but
a tax on the use and exercise of the franchise of transportation. The use of this or any other franchise outside the State
cannot be taxed by New York. The car mileage within the
State and that upon other lines without the State affords a
basis of apportionment of the average total of cars continuously employed by other corporations without the State,'and
the relator's road mileage within and without the State affords
'a basis of apportionment of its average total equipment continuously employed by it respectiVely within and without the
State. To tax on the total value within and without is beyond
the jurisdiction of the State, a taking of property without due
process of law, and an unconstitutional interference with commerce among the States.
A part of this argument we have answered already. But we
must go further. We are not curious to inquire exactly what
kind of 'a tax this is to be called. If it can be sustained by
the name given to it by th6 local courts it must be sustained
by us. It is called a franchise tax in the act, but it is a franchise tax measured by poperty. A tax very like the present
was treated as a tax on the property of the corporation in Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U. S.
341, 353. This seems to be regarded as such a tax by the Court
of Appeals in this case. See People v. Morgan, 178 N. Y. 433,
439. If it is a tax on any franchise which the State of New
York gave, and the same State could take away" it stands at
least no worse. The relator's argument assumes that it must
be regarded as a t ax of a particular kind, in order to invalidate it, although it might be valid if -Legarded as the state
court regards it.
Suppose, then, that the State of New York had taxed the

property directly, there was nothing to hinder its taxing the
whole of it. It is true that it has been decided that property,
even of a domestic corporation, cannot be taxed if it is perma-

nently out of the State. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v.
Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194, 201, 211; Delaware, Lackawanna,&
Western R. R. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U. S. 341; Louisville &
Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U. S. 385. But it has
not been decided, and it could not be decided, that a State
may not tax its own corporations for all their property within
the State during the tax year, even if every item of that property should be taken successively into another State for a day,
a week, or. six months, and then brought back. Using the
language of domicil, which now so frequently is applied to inanimate things, the state of origin remains the -permanent situs
of the property, notwithstanding its occasional excursions to
foreign parts. Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, May 21,
1906, ante p. 409. See also Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v.
Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194, 208, 209.
It was suggested that this case is but the complement of
Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18, and
that as there a tax upon a foreign corporation was sustained,
levied on such proportion of its capital stock as the miles of
track over which its cars were run within the State bore to the'
whole pumber of miles over which its cars were run, so here in
the domicil of such a corporation there should be an exemption
corresponding to the tax held to be lawfully levied elsewhere.
But in that case it was found that the "cars used in this State
have, during all the time for which tax is charged, been running
into, through and out of the. State." The same cars were
continuously receiving the protection of the State and, therefore, i.t was just that the State should tax a proportion of them.
Whether if the same amount of protection had been received
in respect of constantly changing cars the same principle would
