v. SPAN.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 62.

Argued January 8, 1930.-Decided April 14, 1930.

The painting of angle irons as part of necessary repairs in the engine
room of a completed vessel lying tied up to a pier in navigable
waters has a direct relation to navigation or commerce, and a claim
arising out of injuries suffered by a workman in the course of such
employment is controlled exclusively by the maritime law. P. 230.

The principle of uniformity in admiralty and maritime
matters required by the Federal Constitution, as defined
in the case of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S.

'Argument

for Appellants.

The doctrine cannot be destroyed by congressional legislation. Washington v. Dawson & Co., 264 U. S. 219. It is
not based upon the nature of a particular statutewhether compulsory or elective.
In Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469, it
appeared that the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Law
was of the elective type and that the remedy provided
therein was made exclusive of all other claims against
the employer. It was obVious, since the contract of employment was non-maritime and. the activities of the
claimant at the time his injuries were sustained had no
direct relation to' navigation and commerce, that no
characteristic feature of the maritime law was affected,
and that the application of the state act would not interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of the maritime law in its international or interstate relations,-that
it was a "matter of mere. local concern."
Since the matter was of mere local concern, it is clear
that the decision was in no sense a" trek backward " from
the doctrine of the Jensen case, -as it was hailed in some
quarters. The uniformity doctrine forbids the application of such state legislation, only, as will work material
prejudice to characteristic features of the general maritime law or will interfere with the proper harmony and
uniformity of that law in its international and interstate
relations. Under the circumstances disclosed in the
Rohde case, the doctrine therefore was not at all involved.
See also Peters v. Veasey, 251 U. S. 121.
Certainly the parties cannot by their own election, with
or without state sanction, secure to state tribunals a jurisdiction which it is beyond the power of Congress to grant.
This Court has itself expressly disaffirmed the existence
of such a distinction between the effect of a compulsory
act and an elective act. State Industrial Board v. Terry
& Tench Co., 273 U. S. 639; Northern Coal & Dock Co.

281 U. S.

An insurance company, directly liable by statute to an
injured employee, is not estopped to raise the question of
the applicability of a local compensation act. James
Rolph Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 192 Cal. 398.
The doctrine of uniformity is not limited to claims
against the owner of the vessel. In a number of cases
before this Court, a local workmen's compensation act has
been held inapplicable notwithstanding the fact that the
employer was not the owner of the vessel. Messel v.
Foundation Co., 274 U. S. 427; Northern Coal & Dock

No case presents a " matter of mere local concern " in
which concur the facts: (1) that the employee was working under a maritime contract, (2) that his activities at
the time he was injured had direct relation to navigation
and commerce, and (3) that he was injured while on board
a vessel lying in navigable waters. Doey v. Howland, 224

her from the jurisdiction of the admiralty and maritime
law. The Robert IT. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17; Robins Dry

The parties were not " clearly and consciously within
the terms of the state statute," and they did not contract
with reference thereto.

Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248

U. S. 308.
The terms of the general contract of employment between the parties are unimportant. If the appellee, at
the time his injuries were sustained, was employed on shipboard in work of a maritime nature, and his activities had
direct relation to navigation and commerce, a state compensation act cannot be applied even though his gereral
employment and usual activities may not have been
maritime.

Northern Coal & D. Co. v. Strand, 278

U. S. 142.
Span's activities at the time his injuries were sustained had direct relation to navigation and commerce.
Certainly no activities of any nature can have a more
direct relation to navigation and commerce than the performance of repairs to a vessel. Although the work of a
carpenter, boilermaker, or blacksmith is not inherently
maritime, the activities of such mechanics when engaged
in making repairs to and upon a vessel certainly have no
less a direct relation to navigation and commerce than
the activities of a stevedore. Great Lakes Dredge & D.
Co. v. Kierejewski, 261 U. S. 479; Gonsalves v. Morse Dry
D. Co., 266 U. S. 171; Robins Dry Dock & R. Co. v. Dahl,

The fact that Span's injuries may not have been due
to a tort, is no reason for permitting the application of
the local-act.

Parkersburg & Ohio River Transp. Co. v. Parkersburg,

The application of the state compensation act does not
interfere with the necessary uniformity of general maritime law in interstate or foreign commerce.
The repair of an instrumentality of interstate commerce
withdrawn for repairs does not constitute work done in
interstate commerce, and a compensation act of a State
applies to an employee engaged in. such repair. Industrial
Accident Comm'n v. Davis, 259 U. S. 182.
This suit is on a contract, which in no way relates to
interstate or foreign commerce. It is a suit to enforce a
statutory liability on an insurance policy which the state
statute requires shall contain an actual covenant .to pay
the award. The application of the state compensation
act does not prejudice the characteristic features of the
maritime law.
When employment is in connection with essentially.
maritime industry, and both employer and employee are
regularly so engaged, the maritime law may govern the
situation, but no such facts here appear.
The reasoning of cases dealing with the application of
workmen',s compensation laws to injuries occurring on

navigable waters, indicates that this Court, in viewing the
situation of the parties and the law properly applicable,
has considered the presence or absence of facts disclosing
whether the parties contemplated the maritime law as the
basis of their rights and liabilities, or whether the business
was closely connected with maritime matters, as of importance in reaching a conclusion. Citing: Grant SmithPorter Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469; State Industrial

Washington v. Dawson, 264 U. S.219.
To hold the compensation act inappiicable merely because the appellee ventured on navigable waters, cannot
prejudice the characteristic features of the maritime law.
Maritime law aims at a uniform treatment of, and prescribes the law applicable to, maritime workers and maritime employers. The appellee in this case is not shown
to be a maritime worker, and his employer is not shown
to be generally engaged in maritime pursuits. Under
such circumstances, there is no policy of maritime law
which has for its object the protection of employer and
employee in the case at bar.
In matters of local concern, a compensation act may
-apply even if the employment is maritime, and the em-

ployment of appellee and his employer, if maritime, is of
local concern, because the general and usual occupation
of both is not shown to be in connection with matters of
an admiralty or maritime nature.
To hold an insurance carrier which has agreed to render
compensation under a state act liable on its covenant,
cannot prejudice any of the characteristic features of the
maritime law. The enforcement of such a contract does
not involve any relation cognizable under maritime law,
or any relation for which uniform maritime laws are
desirable. Requiring payment of the compensation in
accordance with the agreement does not impair or impinge
upon any rule where uniformity is essential.
MR. JusTIcF, McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
By Act of June 2, 1915; P. L. 736, as amended June 26,
1919, P. L. 642, the Pennsylvania Legislature provided for
payment of compensation by employers to employees
accidentally injured, without regard to fault, created an
administrative Board and prescribed procedure for carrying the general plan into effect. The statute declares there
shall be a conclusive presumption that both employer
and employee accept its provisions unless one of .them
makes written statement to the contrary. Every employer, liable to pay such compensation, unless exempted
by the Board, is required to insure payment in the State
Workmen's Insurance Fund or some authorized insurance
company.
Purporting to proceed under the statute, Abraham
Span-appellee here-made application to the Workmen's Compensation Board for an award against the John
Baizley Iron Works on account of accidental injuries.
He alleged that while employed by that concern he suffered injury; the accident happened " on ship Bald Hill
on Delaware River, Phila., Pa., January 13, 1926" when

BAIZLEY IRON WORKS v. SPAY
222

Opinion of the Court.

he was painting angle irons; both his eyes were affected
by sparks from an acetylene torch in use by a fellow
workman engaged in cutting iron; the business of the
employer was "Iron Works" and his occupation "Blacksmith helper."
The matter went to a referee who took evidence, heard
the parties, awarded compensation according to the statutory schedule, and directed appellant, The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Company, Ltd., insurer of the Iron
Works, to pay the same. Upon successive appeals this
award and judgment were approved by the Compensation Board, Court of Common Pleas, Superior Court, and
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. For purposes of the
appeal to the last, and as permitted by its rule, the parties
substituted the following agreed statement of facts for all
evidence produced at the hearing before the referee"The claimant, Abraham Span, was at the time of the
injuries in question, on January 13, 1926, a resident of
Philadelphia and employed at Philadelphia by the defendant, John Baizley Iron Works. The defendant was
engaged in performing certain repairs to the steamship
'Bald Hill,' at Philadelphia, including inter alia, the
painting of the engine room and repairs to the floor of
the engine room. The said vessel had prior thereto
steamed to Philadelphia for necessary repairs, and at
the time of the alleged accident was tied up to Pier 98
South in the Delaware River. The claimant, in the
course of his aforesaid employment by the defendant, was
painting angle irons in the engine room of the vessel.
Sparks from an acetylene torch being used by a fellow
employe working near claimant, entered the claimant's
eyes and caused the injuries resulting in the alleged disability of the claimant."
The Supreme Court declared: "In our opinion the insurance carrier can be held to only such liabilities as
may be imposed on the employer." And it held that

230

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

when injured, Span "was doing work of a nature which
had no direct relation to navigation or commerce."
The Bald Hill had steamed to Philadelphia for necessary repairs. She was a completed vessel, lying in navigable waters; the employer, Iron Works, was engaged in
making repairs upon her-painting the engine room and
repairing the floor; the claimant went aboard in the course
of his employment and was there engaged about the master's business when hurt. Obviously, considering what
we have often said, unless the State Workmen's Compensation Act changed or modified the rules of the general maritime law, the rights and liabilities of both the
employer and the employee in respect of the latter's
injuries were fixed by those rules and any cause arising
out of them was within the admiralty jurisdiction.
The insistence in behalf of appellee Span is that
when hurt he was doing work of a nature which had no
direct relation to navigation or commerce; and to permitapplication of the State Workmen's Compensation Act
would work no material prejudice to the essential features
of the general maritime law as in Grant Smith-Porter Co.
v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469. But so to hold would conflict
with principles which we have often announced. Great
Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, 261 U. S. 479,
480, 481; Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co.,
266 U. S. 171, 172; Robins Dry Dock Co. v. Dahl, 266

434; Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Strand, 278 U. S.
142, 144.
What work has direct relation to navigation or commerce must, of course, be determined in view of surrounding circumstances as cases arise.

a thing not yet placed into navigation and which had
not become an instrumentality of commerce. In Millers'
Indemnity Underwritersv. Braud, 270 U. S. 59, the decedent met his death while cutting off piles driven into the
land under navigable water. This had only remote relation to navigation or commerce. Sultan Ry. Co. v. Dept.
of 'Labor, 277 U. S. 135, 136, 137, had relation to the
nature of the occupation of men engaged in logging
operations.
Kierejewski was a boiler maker employed by a Dredge
Company to perform services as called upon. When hurt
he was making repairs upon a scow moored in navigable
waters. We held this work had direct relation to navigation and commerce. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.
Kierejewski, supra.
In Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., supra,
the injured workman was repairing the shell plates of a
steamer then in a floating dock. The "accident did not
occur upon land" and we held the rights of the parties
must be determined under the maritime law.
Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Dahl, supra, held
that as the employee was injured while repairing a completed vessel afloat in navigable waters the rights and
liabilities of the parties depended upon the general maritime law and could not be enlarged or impaired by the
state statute.
In Messel v. Foundation Co., supra, the claimant was
injured while repairing a vessel afloat on the Mississippi
River. We said-" The principles applicable to Messel's
recovery, should he have one, must be limited to those
which the admiralty law of the United States prescribes,
including the applicable section of the Federal Employers
Liability Act, incorporated in the maritime law by § 33,
c. 250, 41 Stat. 988, 1007."

I think the judgment below should be affirmed on the

authority of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, 257
U. S. 469 and Millers' Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud,
270 U. S. 59, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama, Ex parte Rosengrant, 213 Ala. 202, Ex parte
Havard, 211 Ala. 605. In that case one employed as a
lumber inspector by a lumber manufacturer, under a
non-maritime contract of employment, was injured in
the course of his employment, while temporarily on board
a schooner lying in navigable waters near his employer's
mill. He was there engaged in checking a cargo of lumber then being discharged from a barge lying nearby, in
navigable waters and alongside a wharf. Recovery for
this injury under the local compensation law was allowed
by the state court, on the ground that the contract of
employment had no relation to navigation and was nonmaritime. This, like the Rosengrant case, seems to differ
from Northern Ccrl & Dock Co. v. Strand, 278 U. S. 142,
in that the employee was not a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act.
