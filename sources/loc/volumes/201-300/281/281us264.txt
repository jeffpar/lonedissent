LUCAS, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. KANSAS CITY STRUCTURAL STEEL
COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 323 and 324. Argued March 13, 14, 1930.-Decided April 14,

1930.
1. Whether in a particular business inventories are necessary for the

determination of income, is a practical question left by the Revenue
Act of 1918, § 203, to the judgment of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. P. 268.
2. The "base stock" method of inventory, using a constant price for
a so-called normal quantity of goods or materials in stock, is inconsistent with the annual accounting required by Congress for income
tax purposes. Id.
3. A company engaged in the business of fabricating and erecting
steel plates for buildings, bridges, etc., under contracts therefor,
ordered the materials for each particular job from the mills, but
aimed to keep an emergency stock on hand for use when mill shipments were delayed, etc., and to keep it replenished from such
shipments. Although no part of the material was earmarked and
set aside as a "stand-by" stock, but all was commingled and indiscriminately used in production, so much of it as fell within the
amount on hand at the close of 1916 was inventoried each year,

until 1921, at the 1916 cost, and the excess at cost or market price,
whichever was lower. The quantities in stock fluctuated from
much below to much above that of 1916. In 1918 and 1920, the
tax years in question, the stock inventoried at the 1916 cost was
revalued by the Commissioner at the current market price, in the
absence of a showing of actual cost, with consequent increase of
income taxes. Held that inventories were properly required and
the Commissioner's action was properly sustained. P. 269.
4. A taxpayer appealing from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals
sustaining an increased income tax resulting from changes made by
the Commissioner in the taxpayer's inventory, has the burden of
proving that the CommLqsioner's action was plainly arbitrary.

the company's 1918 income tax and of $15,953.36 in its
1920 income tax.' These additions were due wholly to
changes made by the Commissioner in the inventory valuation of material carried in stock. The Company valued
at a constant price all the material which did not exceed
in quantity what was said to be the normal stock on
hand.2 The Commissioner revalued this at current market prices. The changes resulted in increasing the December, 1918, inventory by $165,849.46 and the December
31, 1920, inventory by $117,113.61. The Board of Tax
Appeals sustained the Commissioner's action. 11 B. T. A.

Section 203 of the Revenue Act of 1918, Feb. 24, 1919,
c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, provides: "That whenever in
the opinion of the Commissioner the use of inventories is
necessary in order clearly to determine the income of any
taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer
upon such. basis as the Commissioner, with the approval
of the Secretary, may prescribe as conforming as nearly
as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or
business and as most clearly reflecting the income. '

Decision 3296) provides, in Article 1581, that "inventories at the beginning and end of each year are necessary
in every case in which the production, purchase, or sale
of merchandise is an income-producing factor." Article
1582 declares that the basis of valuation "most commonly
used by business concerns and which meets the requirements of the revenue act is (a) cost or (b) cost or market, whichever is lower "; that "goods taken in the inventory which have been so intermingled that they cannot be identified with specific invoices will be deemed to
be . . . the goods most recently purchased "; that the
"taxpayer must satisfy the commissioner of the correctness of the prices adopted "; and that: " (d) Using a constant price or nominal value for a so-called normal quantity of materials or. goods in stock" is not in accord with
the regulations.4
The Company igengaged in the fabrication and erection of steel plates for buildings, bridges, tanks, etc. It
does not carry finished products in stock, but fabricates
the plates for specific structures or contracts. It orders
material from the mills for each structure or. contract;
but it also keeps a supply on hand in order "to insure
the prompt and orderly execution of contracts in view of
delay, etc., incident to shipments from the mills and
other exigencies affecting the availability for use when
needed of material ordered for a particular job." Material
is taken from this supply as and when needed; and the
stock is subsequently replenished.6 On December 31,

The provision relative to the valuation of inventories at a constant

price was, in effect, a restatement of a Treasury ruling promulgated
in September, 1919, as Advisory Tax Board Ruling No. 65, T. B. R.

65, C.B. 1, 51.
5The stipulated facts recite: "When such material is used it is
charged to the contract at its replacement cost and is promptly
replaced with material of a like kind and in a like quantity." The
phrase " charged to the contract" evidently means that it is so
charged in those accounts on the Company's books which are designed
to guide it in determining the cost of a particular. job.

1916, the quantity in stock was 5,554 tons. The Conipany then inventoried it at cost-81.70 per hundredweight f. o. b. Pittsburgh. At the close of each year
thereafter until 1921, the Company inventoried its stock
on hand up to 5,554 tons at that price, regardless of its
actual cost or the market, and the excess, if any, at cost
or market price, whichever was lower. In the tax years
in question, the market was much higher. It is not shown
what the actual cost of the stock then on hand was, or that
any of it had cost as little as $1.70.1 The Commissioner
therefore revalued the entire stock at market price, with
the consequent increase in the taxes complained of.
. First. Whether in a particular business inventories are
necessary for the determination of income is a practical
question left by the statute to the judgment of the Commissioner. On that question, he and the Company did
not differ. In every year, it, without any question or
protest, used inventories in making its return. The dispute was merely on the method of valuation to be adopted
for that part of the stock which it calls its normal stock.
Throughout, the Company valued at cost or market prices
all stock in excess of 5,554 tons; and since 1921 has so
valued all the stock on hand.
It is not contested that if inventories are necessary in
order to determine the Company's income, the "base
stock" method does not fulfill the desiderata. The Federal income tax system is based upon an annual accounting period. This requires that gains or losses be accounted
for in the year in which they are realized. The purpose
of the inventories is to assign to each period its profits
and losses. In years of rising prices, the "base stock"
11
In September, 1917, the Government fixed the price of structural
shapes, f. o. b. Pittsburgh at $3 per hundredweight and of tank plates
at $.25. After relinquishment of Government control, the prices
fell. Those in 1920 were, for structural steel $2.45, for tank plates
$2.65. In 1921 the prices fell to $1.50.

LUCAS v. STRUCTURAL STEEL CO.

Opinion of the Court.

method causes an understatement of income; for it disregards the gains actually realized through liquidation of
low price stock on a high price market. In times of falling prices, it causes an overstatement of income; forit
ignores the losses which result from the consumption of
high price stock. This method may, like many reserves
which business men set up on their books for their own
purposes, serve to equalize the results of operations during a series of years. But it is inconsistent with the annual accounting required by Congress for income tax
purposes. It results in offsetting an inventory gain of
one year against an inventory loss of another, obscures
the true gain or loss of the tax year and, thus, misrepresents the facts. It does not conform with the general or
best accounting methods and is apparently obsolete.
The Company disclaims any defense of the base stock
method; and the lower court disapproved it.
Second. It is urged, however, that the inventory requirement is not applicable to the Company's stock to
the extent of 5,554 tons; that the Company is not a
dealer, manufacturer or producer, but rather a contractor
or builder; that its income results from the performance
of its construction contracts; that the material in its
stand-by stock has no relation to these contracts, the contract pices, or the Company's profits; that the material
from this stock is only borrowed for specific jobs and is
promptly replaced in kind; that it is not an income pro- In a well reasoned report, the Advisory Tax Board, in 1919, ruled
that the " base stock " " minimum " or " cushion " method did not
withstand "the changing tests of time "- nd could not be approved.
Since then, all Regulations of the Department expressly prohibited
its use. See Regulations 45, art. 1582; Regulations 62, art. 1582;

ducing factor, but is like the Company's machinery and
equipment; and that any accretion to the value of this
material is of no consequence until a final liquidation.
The contentions are inconsistent with the Company's
practice and are unsound.
The Company's purchase and production of steel plates
is obviously an income producing factor. Throughout
the years, the Company has varying amounts of material on hand. The value of the particular material used,
at the time of use, plainly affects its profits. That the
material is replaced in kind and its amount kept within
some limits is not exceptional and is of no significance.
Most concerns strive ordinarily to carry no more stock
than is required for the safe and profitable conduct of
the business. They plan neither to run short nor to
overstock. They replace supplies as tLh;y are consumed.
And the cost or value of the new material is properly
reflected in the later inventories and returns. There is
nothing peculiar about the 5,554 tons,--except that that
happened to be the amnt of stock on hand on December 31, 1916. It is not a permanent stock, like machinery or equipment.. Nor is it merely depleted by
borrowing and promptly restored to that fixed size. On
the contrary, the stock has fluctuated from about 3,000
tons in 1918 to 11,000 tons in 1920. There is no stand8 The

by stock set aside and earmarked as such. The material
is all commingled and is indiscriminately used in production, as and when needed. No reason is given for excepting 5,554 tons-no more and no less. To draw an
artificial line at that amount would distort the computation of income in the accounting periods, although
the errors might be equalized in a series of years. Since
inventories are properly deemed necessary, the exception
of that or any amount is nothing but the use of the
discarded "base stock" method.
The Company's case falls far short of meeting the
heavy burden of proving that the Commissioner's action was plainly arbitrary. Compare Lucas v. American
