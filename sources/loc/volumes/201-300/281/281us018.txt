OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Statement of the Case.

281 U. S.

It is well understood that payment by carriers to shippers under the guise of settling claims for loss and damage may in effect constitute discrimination that the Act
was intended to prevent. But it is not suggested how
opportunity for collusion in respect of such matters
would be lessened by abolishing counterclaims in cases
such as this. Collusion and fraud may be practiced in
the defense and settlement of separate actions brought
on such claims as well as when the same matters are put
forward as offsets or counterclaims.
The Act ought not to be construed to put aside state
laws and long established practice in respect of. pleading
unless the intention of Congress so to do is plain. There
appears no reasonable probability that the relegation of
shippers to separate actions for the enforcement of their
claims for loss or damage would operate more effectively
to enforce the purpose of Congress to prevent discrimination. There is no substantial ground upon which the
Act may be given the construction for which the carrier
contends.
The question is answered
No.

Argument for Respondents.

281 U. S.

Personal property taxes, under the laws of Indiana,
were due and became the personal obligation of taxpayers

in each year, whether or not the amount thereof had been
fixed by assessment.
The conception of tax liability entertained by the federal courts and by the courts of Indiana differs from the
conception entertained by certain of the state courts.
Under the former conception, at least, no principle of law
prevents suit in a jurisdiction extraneous to the taxing
jurisdiction.
In Indiana these taxes are debts. Mullikin v. Reeves,
71 Ind. 281, 284; Funk v. State, 166 Ind. 455, 457; Darnell v. State, 174 Ind. 143; Prudential Casualty Co. v.
State, 194 Ind. 542.
The federal rule is illustrated in Billings v. United
States, 232 U. S. 261, where the tax was federal; but the
reasoning applies equally to suits for state taxes. The
nature of the obligation is determined primarily by the
enacting State. See also United States v. Chamberlin,
219 U. S. 250.
Extraterritorial imposition of tax liability must be distinguished from extraterritorial enforcement of such liability. The latter is constitutionally unobjectionable.
Mr. Louis Connick, with whom Messrs. Graham Sumner, Whitney North Seymour and Francis H. Horan were
on the brief, for respondents.
The American authorities in both federal and state
courts universally recognize the principle of private international law which forbids the enforcement by one
sovereign of the revenue laws of another. Meriwether v.

App. D. C. 291; Henry v. Sargeant, 13 N. H. 321, 332.
The English decisions without exception recognize the
same rule. In re Visser (1928), 1 Ch. 878; Municipal
Council of Sydney v. Bull, (1909), 1 K. B. 7; Attorney
Generalfor Canadav. William Schulze & Co., 9 Scots Law

Adoption of a contrary rule would flood the federal
courts with actions by taxing authorities whose neglect
and delinquency could not otherwise be repaired. If the
federal court in New York were required to take jurisdiction it would also result in an intolerable uncertainty
in the administration of estates in New York and States
following the rule announced in New York.
While the function of the federal Court sitting in New
York has perhaps not been defined for all purposes, the
origin of the federal judicial system suggests that that
court was designed to be an impartial tribunal, free from
local prejudice against citizens from other States, administering the law of New York as conceived by the federal
courts sitting in New York insofar as the Constitution and
statutes of the United States do not require a different law
t6 be administered. If the federal court sitting in New
York has any duty to co-operate, or if there is any federal
p6licy indicating that it should co-operate with the States,
it would seem reasonable that, in the absence of controlling federal law to the contrary, the federal court sitting in New York should first concern itself with cooperation with the State in which it sits.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

A fundamental distinction exists between the duties and
powers of a federal court in the taxing State and one
sitting elsewhere.
It seems plain that the attempt to assess taxes in this
case did not result in an imposition of a valid tax liability.
This was the view taken by two of the judges in the Circuit Court of Appeals, but it is unnecessary at this time
to determine that question unless this Court feels that the
rule of international law applied in the courts below
should be abrogated.
This action is and remains an action to collect taxes
alleged to be due to the plaintiff in his official capacity.
It is necessarily, therefore, an attempt to enforce a revenue law against persons and property which were not
within the State of Indiana at the time of the alleged
assessment.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner is the county treasurer of Grant county,
Indiana. Respondents are the executors named in the
will of Richard Edwards Breed, appointed by the Surrogate's Court in the county and State of New York and
there engaged ii the administration of his estate. Petitioner as such treasurer brought this suit in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New
York to recover $958,516.22 claimed as delinquent taxes.
The respondents moved to dismiss on the grounds that
the complaint failed to state a cause of action, that the
court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter, and that
petitioner had not legal capacity to sue. The court declined jurisdiction and entered a decree dismissing the
complaint. 28 F. (2d) 997. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 30 F. (2d) 600.
From 1884 until his death on October 14, 1926, the
testator was a resident and citizen of Grant county, Indi-

Opinion of the Court.

ana. During the last 24 years of that period he owned
stock of corporations and other intangible property in
respet of which there had been no return, assessment or
payment of taxes. After testator's death the county auditor, acting, as it is alleged, under authority of the statutes of Indiana, ascertained the value in each year of the
omitted property, assessed taxes thereon for state, county,
city, and township purposes and charged the same against
such property and the executors. By the statutes of Indiana (ยง 14,299, Bums' Statutes, 1926,) it is made the
duty of the treasurer of each county to collect the taxes
imposed therein for county, city and other purposes. By
ยง 1, c. 54, Session Laws of 1927, county treasurers are authorized "to institute and prosecute to final judgment
and execution, all suits and proceedings necessary for the
collection of delinquent taxes owing by any person residing outside of the State of Indiana or by his legal
representatives
" The recovery here sought is
for Grant county, the city, of Marion and the other political subdivisions therein of which the testator was a resident during the years for which such assessments were
made.
The first question for consideration is whether petitioner
had authority to bring this suit.
The United States District Court inNew York exercises
a jurisdiction that is independent of and undef a sovereignty that is different from that of Indiana. Grant v.
Leach & Company, 280 U. S. 351. Pennoyer v. Nefl, 95
U. S. 714, 732. And, so far as concerns petitioner's capacity
to sue therein, that court is not to be distinguished from
the courts of the State of New York. Hale v. Allinson,
188 U. S. 56, 68.
Petitioner claims only. by virtue of his office. Indiana
is powerless to give any force or effect beyond her own
limits to the Act of 1927 purporting to authorize this suit

or to the other statutes empowering and prescribing the
duties of its officers in respect of the levy and collection
of taxes. And, as Indiana laws are the sole source of
petitioner's authority, it follows that he had none in New
York. Mechem, Public Offices and Officers, ยง 508. State
v. Scott, 182 N. C. 865, 873. He is the mere arm of the
State for the collection of taxes for some of its subdivisions
and has nobetter standing to bring suits in courts outside
Indiana than have executors, administrators, or chancery
receivers without title, appointed under the laws and by
the courts of that State. It is well understood that they
are without authority, in their official capacity, to sue as
of right in the federal court's in other States. From the
earliest time, federal courts in one State have declined
to take jurisdiction of suits by executors and administrators appointed in another State. Dixon's Executors v.
Ramsay's Executors, 3 Cranch 319, 323. Kerr v. Moon,
9 Wheat. 565, 571. Vaughan v. Northup, 15 Pet. 1, 5.
And since the decision of this Court in Booth v. Clark, 17
How. 322, it has been the practice in federal courts to limit
such receivers to suits in the jurisdiction in which they
are appointed. Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris,198
U. S. 561, 578. Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, 257.
Sterrett v. Second National Bank, 248 U. S. 73, 76. The
reasons on which rests this long established practice in
respect of executors, administrators and such receivers
apply with full force here. We conclude that petitioner
lacked legal capacity to sue.
It is not necessary to express any opinion upon the question considered below, whether a federal court in one
State will enforce the revenue laws of another State.

Decree affirmed.
