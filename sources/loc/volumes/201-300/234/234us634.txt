COLLINS v. COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.
No. 35.

Submitted April 22, 1914.-Decioed June 22, 1914.

A state penal statute which prescribes no standard of conduct that it
is possible to know violates the fundamental principles of justice
embodied in the conception of due process of law.
International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, ante, p. 216, followed to the
effect that the provisions in regard to pooling crops in chapter 117
of the Laws of Kentucky of 1906 as amended by chapter 8 of the
Laws of 1908, as construed by the courts of that State, in connection
with the anti-trust act of 1890 and § 198 of the Kentucky constitution of 1891 do not prescribe any standard of conduct, and there-

Amendment.
141 Kentucky, 565, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of provisions of the statutes of Kentucky of 1906, permitting
combinations or pools of tobacco and other farm products,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. E. L. Worthington and Mr. J. M. Collins for plaintiff in error.
Mr. James Garnett, Attcmney General of the State of Ken-

tucky, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error, Patrick Collins, and other tobacco
growers of Mason County, Kentucky, entered into a
pooling contract with the Burley Tobacco Society and
the Mason County Board of Control whereby they consigned to the Society their respective crops of tobacco
(raised in the year 1907) to be sold by the Society as their
agent upon such terms as it should prescribe, but not
less than a minimum price. Because Collins disposed of
his crop, without the consent -of the agents of the pool,
he was indicted. He demurred to the indictment upon
both state and Federal grounds, setting forth as the latter
that the statutes under which he was prosecuted contravened the, Fourteenth Amendment of -the Federal
Constitution, in that they denied to him the equal protection of the laws and deprived him of liberty aild property
without due process of law, and also were repugnant to
the' commerce clause and the Federal Anti-trust Act of
July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209. The demurrer was
overruled and trial was had. There was evidence that
the tobacco had been removed by Collins to Cincinnati,
Ohio, and there sold. Collins was found guilty and sen-

tenced to pay a fine. The Court of Appeals having affirmed the judgment (141 Kentucky, 564), this writ of
error is prosecuted.
The conviction was under the provisions of § 3941a of
the Kentucky statutes being the act of March 21, 1906
(Laws 1906, c. 117) as amended by the act of March 13,
1908 (Laws 1908, c. 8). The act of 1906 permitted persons to 'pool or combine' the crops of 'tobacco, wheat,
corn, oats, hay or other farm products' raised by them
'for the purpose of obtaining a better or higher price
therefor than could or might be obtained by selling said
crops separately or individually.' The persons so agreeing were also allowed to select agents to receive and to sell
or dispose of the crops, so placed, in order to accomplish
the object of the combination. The amendment of 1908, in
addition to giving remedies by way of injunction and damages, provided that the agent 'when so selected' should
have 'the sole right to sell said crop so pooled or combined,' that it should be unlawful 'for any owner of such
crop to sell or dispose of same and for any person to knowingly purchase the same without the written consent of
such agent,' and that 'upon conviction thereof,' a fine
should be imposed.
This statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky, is not to be regarded as an independent enactment but is to be viewed in connection with the Kentucky anti-trust act of 1890 (Ky. Stats., § 3915) and in the
light of § 198 of the Kentucky constitution adopted in
1891. The statute of 1890 forbade the formation of pools
or combinations for the purpose of regulating, controlling
or fixing the price of merchandise or property of any kind.
Section 198 of the constitution provided that it should
be the duty of the General Assembly from time to time
to enact such laws as might be necessary "to prevent all
trusts, pools, combinations or other organizations from
combining to depreciate below its real value any article,

or to enhance the cost of any article above its real value."
It was held that the constitutional provision did not repeal
the act of 1890 (Commonwealth v. Grinstead, 108 Kentucky, 59); and in Commonwealth v. International Harvester Co., 131 Kentucky, 551, it was further held (approving the views expressed in Owen County Burley Tobacco
Society v. Brumback, 128 Kentucky, 137) that the act
of 1906 did not violate 1§198 of the constitution in as
much as it-'did not authorize a pool to enhance the cost
of crops above their real value,' but that the effect of the
last mentioned act 'when considered in connection with
the act of 1890, § 198 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, was to confer, not only upon the farmer, but upon
all others the right to pool their products, skill, or capital
for the purpose of obtaining the real value thereof.' See
Commonwealth v. Hodges, 137 Kentucky, 233, 241; Tnternational Harvester Co. v. Commonwealth, 144 Kentucky,
405, 410; 147 Kentucky, 557, 559; 147 Kentucky, 564,
565. Section 3941a is treated as an amendment to § 3915;
and, as was said in Commonwealth v. International Harvester Co., 147 Kentucky, 573, 575, the state court 'upheld the validity of both statutes, but also held that the
last amended or modified the first to the extent of legalizing pools, trusts, combinations; agreements, etc., but
that both statutes are so governed and restricted in their
operation by § 198, Constitution, as that they cannot
be held to allow, but, on the contrary, prohibit persons,
associations, co-partnerships or corporations, engaged or
participating in a pool, trust, combination or agreement,
by means thereof, to fix, control or regulate the price of
any commodity or artiicle by raising or depreciating, or
attempting to raise or depreciate, it above or below its
real value."
As the present prosecution was under this legislation,
thus construed as constituting in effect a single act, the

question presented is the same as that decided by this
court in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky (ante,
p. 216). It was found that the statute in its reference to
'real value' prescribed no standard of conduct that it
was possible to know; that it violated the fundamental
principles of justice embraced in the conception of due
process of law in compelling men on peril of indictment
to guess what their goods would have brought under other
conditions not ascertainable.
The Harvester Company was prosecuted for being a
party to a price-raising combination; Collins, for breaking
a combination agreement and- selling outside the pool
which he had joined. With respect to each, the test of
the legality of the combination was said to be whether
it raised prices above the 'real value.' If it did-in
Collins' case-he would be subject to penalties for remaining in the combination; if it did not, he would be
punishable for not keeping his tobacco in the pool. He
was thus bound to ascertain the 'real value'; to determine his conduct not according to the actualities of life,
or by reference to knowable criteria, but by speculating
upon imaginary conditions and endeavoring to conjecture what would be the value under other and so-called
normal circumstances with fair competition,'eliminating
the abnormal influence of the combination itself, and of
all other like combinations, and of still other combinations which these were organized to oppose. The objection that the statute, by reason of its uncertainty, was
fundamentally defective was as available to Collins as itwas to the Harvester Company.
In this view, it is unnecessary to consider the objection
under he commerce clause or the alleged conflict, as to
interstate transactions, with the Federal Anti-trust Act.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
for'further proceedings not inconsistent wit'ia this opinion.
It is so ordered.
