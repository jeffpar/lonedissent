point this case comes within former rulings of this court,
as we have seen.
As to the contention that the case really raised a Federal
question because it involved the constitutional validity
of a state statute when opposed to the exclusive rights
secured under a Federal law,-an examination of the
record shows that no such question was made in the state
court, nor was it necessarily involved in the decision made
in such sense as to make the case reviewable here on that
ground.
It follows that the case must be dismissed for want of
jurisdiction.

ATLANTIC TRANSPORT COMPANY OF WEST
VIRGINIA v. IMBROVEK.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 215.

Argued January 29, 30, 1914.-Decided May 25, 1914.

As a general principle, the test of admiralty jurisdiction in tort in this
country is locality.
Admiralty has jurisdiction of a suit in personam by an employ6 of a
stevedore against the employer to recover for injuries sustained
through the negligence of the latter while engaged in loading a vessel
lying at the dock in navigable waters.
The precise scope of admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter of obvious
principle or of very accurate history, The Blackheath, 195 U. S. 361,
and qtwre whether the admiralty jurisdiction extends to a case where
the tort is not of a maritime nature although committed on navigable waters.
A tort committed on a vessel in connection with a service thereto may
be maritime even if there is no fault on the part of, or injury to, the
.ship itself.

Argument, for Petitioner.

Stevedores are now as clearly identified with maritime affairs as are
the mariners themselves.
Whether the employer failed to -provide a safe place to work is a question properly determinable by the Circuit Court of Appeals in last
resort, and this court will not disturb such a finding if concurred in
by both courts below and justified by the record.
193 Fed. Rep. 1019, affirmed.
THE facts, which 'involve the admiralty jurisdiction of
the United States courts over suits for personal injuries
sustained on a vessel in port while being loaded by a
stevedore, and questions of negligence of the stevedore,
are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Edward Duffy, with whom Mr. Nicholas P. Bond
and Mr. Ralph Robinson were on the brief, for petitioner:
Admiralty has not jurisdiction; locality is not the sole
test of jurisdiction; the tort is not of amaritime nature; the
master did not fail to furnish a safe place to labor; failure
to use pins was not the proximate cause; there was no evidence to show that the master failed to use reasonable care.

Mr. W. H. Price, Jr., and Mr. John E. Semmes, Jr.,
with whom Mr. Johh E. Semmes, Mr. Jesse N. Bowen and
Mr. Matthew Gault were on the brief, for respondent:
Admiralty has jurisdiction in the cases at bar, for the
following reasons:
The admiralty courts having properly assumed jurisdiction when the libel was brought against both the ship
and the stevedore company, should retain jurisdiction to
determine the liability of the, stevedore company, even
though the libel be subsequently dismissed as to the ship.
Jurisdiction once assumed by the Federal court because
jurisdictional amount is alleged in good faith to be involved, is not lost because it subsequently develops by the
evidence that less than the jurisdictional amount is actually involved.
Where the requisite diversity of citizenship exists at the
commencement of a suit, no subsequent change in the

situation of the parties ousts the jurisdiction of the Federal court.
Where Federal and non-Federal questions are involved
in the same suit, and jurisdiction has properly attached for
the purpose of determining the Federal question, it is
proper for the Federal court to decide the local question
only and omit to decide the Federal question. Campbell v.
Hackfeld, 125 Fed. Rep. 696, can be distinguished.
The sole test of admiratty jurisdiction over torts is the
locality of the person or thing injured at the time of the
impact with the intentional or negligent force.
There is a distinction between admiralty jurisdiction of
the United States and that of England.
Locality is the sole test.
The constitutional extent of admiralty jurisdiction is
involved in this case.
The tort in this case was essentially maritime in its
nature.
On the evidence the master failed in his duty to provide
a safe place.
The gang boss was a vice-principal, as was also the foreman.

The evidence was sufficient as to the proximate cause
of the accident and as to lack of safety of place of work.

MR. JUsTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a libel to recover for personal injuries sustained
by the libelant as a stevedore in the employ of the Atlantic
Transport Company (the petitioner) which was engaged
in loading the Pretoria, belonging to the HamburgAmerican Steam Packet Company, while lying in the port

ATLANTIC. TRANSPORT CO. v. IMBROVEK.

Opinion of the Court.

of Baltimore. The libL was brought against both the
owner of the ship and the: stevedore company. it was dismissed as to the former, but a recovery against the latter
was allowed by the District Court (190 Fed. Rep. 229) and
sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals (193 Fed. Rep.
1019). This writ of certiorari was granted.
The libelant was one cf a gang engaged in loading and
stowing copper. He was working on the ship, under one
of the hatches. The covers of uhe hatch were. in three
sections, the division being made by two movable iron
beams placed athwart the ship. The coverings of the
middle section had been removed and placed on top of the
fore and after sections. On the dock, the copper was piled
upon a rope mat which was lifted by a winch, swung over
the hatch, and lowered into the hold. On one of its return
trips the mat caught under the after crossbeam which was
instantly jerked out of'its support and, with the lengthwise
timbers resting on it and the hatch covers, fell into the
hold severely injuring the libelant. The District Court
(referring to the petitioner, the Atlantic Transport Company, as the stevedore) said, p. 231: "There would have
been no accident had the entire hatch been uncovered.
To uncover a hatch takes time and labor. If bad weather
comes, it must be covered. Unnecessary uncovering is
to be avoided. It is easy to make a partially covered
hatch absolutely safe. The crossbeams of the hatch have
holes in their ends. There are corresponding holes in the
hatch combings. Pins can be put through these holes. It
takes about five minutes to put them in. When in place,
an accident such as gave rise to this case cannot happen.
The ship's carpenter of the Pretoria keeps the pins when
not in use. Accidents often happen because an opened
hatch has been left unguarded, or because the hatch coverings fall into the hold. 'When they do, there is usually a
dispute as to whether the ship or the stevedore is to blame.
In the case at bar the ship and the stevedore were repre-

sented by the same proctors and by the same advocates.
The stevedore acquits the ship . . . The stevedore
proved that, when the ship came into port, it took complete
charge of the hatches. It uncovered so much of them as
it saw fit. If the pins, were in and it wanted them out, it
took them out. It laid them on the deck. The ship's
carpenter gathered them up. If the pins were out and it
wanted them in, it told the ship's carpenter. He put them
in." For its failure to use due diligence in seeing that the
libelant had a safe place in which to work the District
Court held the Transport Company liable.
The principal question is whether the District Court had
jurisdiction; that is, whether the cause was one 'of, admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' Const. Art. III, § 2;
Rev. Stat., § 563; Judicial Code, § 24; Act of Sept. 24,
1789, c. XX, § 9, 1 Stat. 73, 76. As the injury occurred
on board a ship while it was lying- in navigable waters,
there is no doubt that the requirement as to locality was
fully met. The petitioner insists, however, that locality
is not the sole test, and that it must appear that the tort
was otherwise of a maritime nature. And this was the
view taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, in affirming a decree dismissing a libel for want of
jurisdiction in a similar case. Campbell v. Hackfeld & Co.,
125 Fed. Rep. 696.
At an early period the court of admiralty in England
exercised jurisdiction 'over torts, injuries, and offences,
in ports within the ebb and flow of the tide, on the British
seas and on the high seas.' De Lovio v. Boit, 2 Gall. 398,
406, 464, 474. While its authority was denied when the
injurious action took place infra corpus comitatus, it was
not disputed that jurisdiction existed when the wrong
was done 'upon the sea, or any part thereof which is not
within any county.' (4 Inst. 134.) The jurisdiction in
admiralty of the courts of the United States is not controlled by the restrictive statutes and judicial prohibitions

ATLANTIC TRANSPORT CO. v. IMBROVEK.

Opinion of the Court.

of England (Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 457, 458; Insurance Company v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 24; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 576)-; and the limitation with respect
to torts committed within the body of any county is not
applicable here. Waring v. Clarke, supra; The Magnolia,
20 How. 296. "In regard to torts "-said Mr. Justice
Story in Thomas v. Lane, 2 Sumn. 1, 9-"I havealways
understood, that the jurisdiction of the Admiralty is exclusively dependent upon the locality of the act. The
Admiralty has not, and never (I believe) deliberately
claimed to have any jurisdiction over torts, except such as
are maritime torts, that is, such as are committed on the
high seas, or on waters within the ebb and flow of the tide."
This rule-that locality furnishes the test-has been frequently reiterated, with the substitution (under the doctrine of The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443), of navigable
waters for tide waters. Thus, in the case of The Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore R. R. Co. v. The Philadelphia & Havre de Grace Steam Towboat Co., 23 How. 209,
215, the court said: "The jurisdiction of courts of admiralty, in matters of contract, depends upon the nature
and character of the contract; but in' torts, it depends entirely on locality." Again., in the case of The Plymouth, 3
Wall. 20, where jurisdiction was denied upon the ground
that the substance and consummation of the wrong took
place on land and not on navigable water, the court said,
p. 35: "The jurisdiction of the admiralty over maritime
torts does not depend upon the wrong having been committed on board the vessel; but upon its having been committed upon the high seas or other navigable waters.-A
trespass on board of a vessel, or by the vessel itself, above
tide-water, when that was the limit of jurisdiction, was
not of admiralty cognizance. The reason was, that it was
not committed within the locality that gave the jurisdiction. The vessel itself was unimportant. . . . The
jurisdiction of the admiralty does not depend upon the

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

fact that the injury was inflicted by the vessel, but upon
the locality-the high seas, or navigable waters where it
occurred. Every species of tort, however occurring, and
whether on board a vessel or not, if upon the high seas or
navigable waters, is of admiralty cognizance." See Manro
v. Almeida, 10 Wheat. 473; Waring v. Clarke, supra,
p. 459; The Lexington, 6 How. 344, 394; The Commerce, 1
Black, 574, 579; The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 215;

511, 513; The H. S. Pickands, 42 Fed. Rep. 239, 240; Hermann v. Port Blakely Mill Co., 69 Fed. Rep. 646, 64';
The Strabo, 90 Fed. Rep. 110; 2 Story on the Constitution,
§ 1666. It is also apparent that Congress in providing for
the punishment of crimes committed upon navigable
waters has regarded the locality of the offense as the basis
for the exercise of its authority. Act of April 30, 1790,
c. IX, § 8, 1 Stat. 112, 113; act of March 3, 1825, c. LXV,
4 Stat. 115; Rev. Stat., §§ 5339, 5345, 5346; Criminal
Code, § 272, 35 Stat. 1088, 1142; United States v. Bevans,
3 Wheat. 336, 387; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat.
76; United States v. Rodgers, 150 U. S.249, 260, 261, 285;
Wynne v. United States, 217 U. S. 234, 240.
But the petitioners urge that the general statements
which we have cited, with respect to the exclusiveness of
the test of locality in cases of tort, are not controlling; and
that in every adjudicated case in this country in which the
jurisdiction of admiralty with respect to torts has been
sustained, the tort apart from the mere place of its occur-

ATLANTIC TRANSPORT CO. v. IMBROVEK.

Opinion of the Court.

rence has been of a maritime character. It is asked
whether admiralty would entertain a suit for libel or slander circulated on board ship by one passenger against
another. See Benedict, Admiralty, 4th ed., § 231. The
appropriate basis, it is said, of all admiralty jurisdiction,
whether in contract or in tort, is the maritime nature of
the transaction or event; it is suggested that the wider
authority exercised in very early times in England may
be due to its antedating the recognition by the commonlaw courts of transitory causes of action and thus arose by
virtue of necessity.
We do not find it necessary to enter upon this broad inquiry. As this court has observed, the precise scope of
admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter of 'obvious principle
or of very accurate history,' The Blackheath, supra. And
we are not now concerned with the extreme cases which
are hypothetically presented. Even if it be assumed that
the requirement as to locality in tort cases, while indispensable, is not necessarily exclusive, still in the present
case the wrong which was the subject of the suit was, we
think, of,a maritime nature and hence the District Court,
from any point of view, had jurisdiction. The petitioner
contends that a marith-e tort is. one arising out of an injury to a ship caused by the negligence of a ship or a person or out of an injury to a person by the negligence of a
ship; that there must either be an injury to a ship or an
injury by the negligence of the ship, including therein the
negligence of her owners or mariners; and that, as there
was no negligence of the ship in the present case, the tort
was not maritime. This view we deem to be altogether
too narrow.
The libelant was iniured on a ship, lying in navigable
waters, and while he was engaged in the performance of a
maritime service. We entertain no doubt that the service
in loading and stowing a ship's cargo is of this character.
Upon its proper performance depend in large measure the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

safe carrying of the cargo and *he safety of the ship itself;
and it is a service absolutely necessary to enable the ship
to discharge its maritime duty. Formerly the work was
done by the ship's crew; but, owing to the exigencies of
increasing commerce and the demand for rapidity and
special skill, it has become a specialized service devolving
upon a class 'as clearly identified with maritime affairs
as are the mariners.' See The George T. Kemp, 2 Lowell,
477, 482; The Circassian, 1 Ben. 209; The Windermere, 2
Fed. Rep. 722; The Canada, 7 Fed. Rep. 119; The Hattie
M. Bain, 20 Fed. Rep. 389; The Gilbert Knapp, 37 Fed.
Rep. 209; The Main, 51 Fed. Rep. 954; Norwegian Steamship Co. v. Washington, 57 Fed. Rep. 224; The Seguranca,
58 Fed. Rep. 908; The Allerton, 93 Fed. Rep. 219; Hughes,
Adm. 113; Benedict, Adm., 4th ed., § 207. The libelant
was injured because the care required by the law was not
taken to protect him while he was doing this work. We
take it to be clear that the District Court sitting in admiralty was entitled to declare the applicable law in such
a case, as it was within the power of Congress to modify
that law. Waring v. Clarke, supra; The Lottawanna, supra.
The fact that the ship was not found to be liable for the
neglect is not controlling. If more is required than the
locality of the wrong-in order to give the court jurisdiction,
the relation of the wrong to maritime service, to navigation and to commerce on navigable waters, was quite sufficient. Even with respect to contracts where subjectmatter is the exclusive test, it has been said that the true
criterion is "whether it was a maritime contract, having
reference to maritime service or maritime transactions."
Insurance Company v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 26. The Constitution provides that the judicial power shall extend 'to
all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' and the
act, of Congress defines the jurisdiction of the District
Court, with respect to civil causes, in terms of like scope.
To hold that a case of a tort committed on board a ship

Statement of the Case.

in navigable waters, by one who has undertaken a maritime service, against one engaged in the performance of
that service, is not embraced within the constitutional
grant and the jurisdictional act, would be to establish a
limitation wholly without warrant.
The remaining question relates to the finding of negligence. It is urged that the neglect was that of a fellowservant and hence that the petitioner was not liable. Both
courts below, however, concurred in the finding, that the
petitioner omitted to use proper diligence to provide a
safe place of work. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh,
149 U. S. 368, 386. As the question belongs to a class
which under the distribution of judicial power is determinable by the Circuit Court of Appeals in last resort, we
shall not undertake to discuss it at length or to restate
the evidence. Chicago Junction Rwy. Co. v. King, 222
U. S. 222, 224; Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Rwy. Co. v. Brown,
229 U. S. 317, 320; Grand Trunk Rwy. Co. v. Lindsay, 233
U. S. 42, 50. It is sufficient to say that we are satisfied
from an examination of the record that the ruling was
justified.
