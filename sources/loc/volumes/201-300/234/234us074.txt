TAYLOR v. ANDERSON.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.
No. 338.

Submitted April 30, 1914.-Decided May 25, 1914.

Whether a case begun in a District Court is one arising under the Constitution or a law or treaty of the United States in the sense of the
jurisdictional statute (Judicial Code, § 24), must be determined from
what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim
in the declaration unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or
avoidance of defenses which may be interposed by defendant.
197 Fed. Rep. 383, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the United States under §24, Judicial Code, are
stated in. the opinion.
Mr. Napoleon B. Maxey for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. H. A. Ledbetter for defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
The judgment here under review is one of dismissal for
want of jurisdiction. The action was in ejectment. The
petition alleged that the plaintiffs were owners in fee and
entitled to the possession; that the defendants had forcibly
taken possession and were wrongfully keeping the plaintiffs out of possession, and that the latter were damaged
thereby in a sum named.' Nothing more was required to
state a good cause of action. Snyder's Comp. Laws Okla.,
§§ 5627, 6122; Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 340. But
the petition, going beyond what was required, alleged

with much detail that the defendants were asserting ownership in themselves under a certain deed and that it was
void under the legislation of Congress restricting the
alienation of lands allotted. to the Choctaw and Chickasaw
Indians. However essential or appropriate these allegations might have been in a bill in equity to cancel or annul
the deed, they were neither essential nor appropriate in a
petition- in ejectment. Apparently, their purpose was to
anticipate and avoid a defense which it was supposed the
defendants would interpose, but, of course, it rested with
the defendants to select their ground of defense, and it
well might be that this one would not be interposed. In
the orderly course, the plaintiffs were required to state
their own case in the first instance and then to deal with
the defendants' after it should be disclosed in the answer.
Snyder's Comp. Laws, §§ 5634, 5642, 5668; Boston &c.
Mining Co. v. Montana Ore Co., 188 U. S. 632, 639.
Diversity of citizenship was not alleged, and, unless the
allegations respecting the invalidity, under the legislation
of Congress, of the defensive claim attributed to the defendants operated to bring the case within the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court, the judgment of dismissal was plainly
right.
It is now contended that, these allegations showed that
the case was one arising under the laws of the United
States, namely, the acts restricting the alienation of
Choctaw and Chickasaw allotments, and therefore brought
it within the Circuit Court's jurisdiction. But the contention overlooks repeated decisions of this court by which
'it has become firmly settled that whether a case is one
arising under the Constitution or a law or treaty of the
United States, in the sense of the jurisdictional statute
(now § 24, Judicial Code), must be determined from what
necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own
claim in the bill or declaration, unaided by anything
alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which

it is thought the defendant may interpose. Tennessee v.
Union and Planters' Bank, 152 U. S. 454, 460, 464; Third
Street Railway Co. v. Lewis, 173 U. S. 457, 460; Florida

v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569; Denver v. New York
Trust Co., 229 U. S. 123, 133-135. Tested by this standard, as it must be, the case disclosed by the petition was
not one arising under a law of the United States.
Whether or not in other respects the plaintiffs overlooked an authorized mode of securing relief to which they
may be entitled need not now be considered. See 35 Stat.
312, 314, c. 199, § 6; Bowling v. United States, 233 U. S.

No. 367.

Argued May 7, 8, 1914.-Decided May'25, 1914.

Findings of fact concurred in by two lower Federal courts will not be
disturbed by this court unless shown to be clearly erroneous.
A purchaser fron a patentee is bound to take notice that the land was
acquired under the homestead law when that appears in the patent,
and if the other circumstances show that the purchase was made
with knowledge that the land was known to be coal land when it
was entered by the patentee, the purchaser must be deemed to have
