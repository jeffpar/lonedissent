The eleven carriers who are appellees on this record filed

ยง 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. as amended by the
act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 547. After
full hearing the Commission entered an order granting
in certain respects the relief prayed but e~tablishing" a
proportionate relation to be maintained between the lower
rate for the longer haul and the higher rate for the shorter
haul upon the basis of percentages which were fixed with
reference to defined zones. The carriers refused to obey
the order and filed their bill in the Commerce Court to
enjoin its enforcement. An interlocutory injunction was
ordered. The defendants moved to dismiss and on the
overruling of the motions appealed from the interlocutory
order, that case being No. 137. Subsequently upon the
election of the defendants not to plead further, a final
decree was entered and appealed from, that appeal being

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, ON

THE RELATION OF DUNNE, GOVERNOR, AND
LUCEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL, v. ECONOMY
LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 179.

Argued April 29, 30, 1914.-Deided June 22, 1914.

The provisions in the Ordinance for Government of the Northwest
Territory and subsequent acts of Congress to the effect that navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and, St. Lawrence rivers
shall be common highways and 'forever free to the inhabitants of
that Territory and of the United States do not determine navigability
of any of the streams but only defind rights dependent upon the
existence of navigability.
There is no Federal right involved in the obstruction, or use by private
owners, of a non-navigable stream wholly within a State.
The question of navigability of a river wholly within a State is purely
one of fact, and Where the state court has decided that such a river
is non-navigable there is no right left to review.
A State has no Federal rights which it may exert for itself or on behalf
of its citizens or of all the citizens of the United States in regard to a
river wholly within its boundaries which the highest court of the
State has declared to be non-navigable; nor are any such rights
created by acts of Congress merely authorizing surveys tor and esti'VOL.
