Syllabus.

follows that it may not, in its exercise, derogate from the
similar authority of another State. The state power can
extend only to the transactions within its own territory
and the ferriage from its own shore. It follows that the
fact that rates were fixed by New York did not preclude
New Jersey from establishing reasonable rates with. respect
to the ferry establishment maintained on its side.
With respect to the rates for round trips, we do not
construe the ordinance as requiring the company to issue
round-trip tickets at its office in New Jersey. We may
not look into the testimony and it does not appear that
such a construction has been placed upon the ordinance
by the state court. Viewed as a limitation upon rates
charged for such round-trip tickets, when sold by the
company in New Jersey, we think that the ordinance is
valid being one relating to the transactions of the company in New Jersey and the charges there enforced.
Whether it would be competent for the State, through
the local board, to require the company to issue roundtrip tickets, is a question not presented by the record, and
we express no opinion upon it.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

ment of an ordinance adopted, in the year 1911, by the
city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The ordinance related
to the maintaining of ferries from that city across the St.
Mary's river to the opposite shore in the Province of
Ontario; and the complainant contended that, as applied
to it, the ordinance was a violation of the commerce clause
of the Federal Constitution and of article I of the treaty of
January 11, 1909, 36 Stat. 2448, 2449, between the United
States and Great Britain. The District Court granted the
relief as prayed (194 Fed. Rep. 522); and this appeal is
brought.
The Transit Company holds a license from the Domirion Government to operate a ferry between Sault Ste.
Marie, Ontario, and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. It owns,
and uses in this business, two steam ferryboats of British
registry; it leases a private wharf in the City of Sault Ste.
Marie, Michigan, and there maintains an office where
fares axe received. The Canadian license prescribes the
frequency of the service and fixes the maximum fares to
be charged; it also provides that the licensee shall not
'infringe any of the'laws or by-laws or of the regulations'
of the United States or of the State of Michigan or 'of the
town of Sault Ste. Marie, U. S. A.' in reference to ferriage,
'which may be applicable to the said ferry or such portion
thereof as may be within the jurisdiction of any of them.'
The City of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, was authorized
by its charter to 'establish, license and regulate ferries to
and from the city,' and. to prescribe rates. The charter
also provided: "The council may regulate and license
ferries from the city or any place or landing therein to the
opposite shore . . . and may require the payment of
such reasonable sum for such license as the council shall
deem proper; and may impose such reasonable terms and
restrictions in relation to the keeping and management of
such ferries, and the time, manner and rates of carriage
and transportation of persons and property as may be

SAULT STE. MARIE v. INT'L TRANSIT CO.

Opinion of the Court.

proper; and provide for the revocation of any such license,
and for the punishment, by proper fines and penalties, of
the violation of any ordinance prohibiting unlicensed ferries and regulating those established and licensed." Under
this authority, the city adopted the ordinance in question.
Section one is ag follows:
"No person, persons, or company shall operate a ferryboat, or engage in the business of carrying or transporting
persons or property thereon from the City of Sault Ste.
Marie, Michigan, and across the St. Mary's River to the
opposite shore, without first obtaining a license therefor
from the Mayor and by otherwise complying with the
provisions of this ordinance."
The Mayor was empowered to grant a license upon the
payment of fifty dollars annually for each ferryboat engaged in such transportation, and it was further provided
that, before any license should be issued, the person or
company desiring the same should make application setting forth a schedule of the rates proposed to be charged
within the prescribed territory. Additional provisions
fixed the period and frequency of service and the rates to
be charged from the licensee's dock within the city to the
opposite shore. The Mayor was authorized to revoke the
license if he was satisfied that any of the provisions of the
ordinance were. violated. After the passage of this ordinance, one Pocock, operating a ferryboat belonging to
the Transit Company without a license having been obtained therefor, was arrested and fined. Alleging the purpose of the city to enforce the ordinance, and its invalidity,
the Transit Company then brought this suit.
It will be observed that the question is not simply as
to the power of the State to prevent extortion and to fix
reasonable ferry rates from the Michigan shore; it is not
,as to the validity of a mere police regulation governing the
manner of conducting the business in order to secure safety
and the public convenience. (See Port Richmond &c.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

Ferry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, ante, p. 317, decided this day.) The ordinance goes beyond this. The
ordinance requires a municipal license; and the fundamental question is whether in the circumstances shown
the State, or the city acting under its authority, may make
its consent a condition precedent to the prosecution of the
business. If the State, or the city, may make its consent
necessary, it may withhold it. The appellee, having its
domicile in Canada, is engaged in commerce between
Canada and the United States. At the wharf which it
leases for the purpose on the American shore, it receives
and lands persons and property. Has the State of Michigan the right to make this commercial intercourse a matter of local privilege, to demand that it shall not be carried
on without its permission, and to exact as the price of its
consent-if it chooses to give it-the payment of a license
fee?
This, question must be answered in the negative. It is
urged, on behalf of the city, that the State either directly
or through its municipalities may establish and license
ferries-may grant 'ferry franchises (Fanningv. Gregoire,
16 How. 524; Conway v. Taylor's Executor, 1 Black, 603;
Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, 107 U. S. 365). But,
since the decision in Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania,
114 U. S. 196, it has been clear that, whatever authority
the State may have for this purpose, it does not go so far
as to enable the State to interdict one in the position of the
appellee from conducting the commerce in which it is engaged, or justify the State in imposing exactions upon that
commerce in the view that business of this character may
be carried on only by virtue of its consent express or implied. In that case the ferry company was a New Jersey
corporation, receiving and landing its passengers and property at its wharf in Philadelphia in substantially the same
manner as the appellee transacts its business at its wharf
in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The court held that it was

SAULT STE. MARIE v. INT'L TRANSIT CO.

341

Opinion of the Court.

not within the power of the State to prevent the ferry
company from so doing; that this was an essential part of
the interstate transportation which the State could not
forbid, or burden by a privilege tax. See Philadelphia&
S. Mail Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S.326, 343.
Referring to foreign commerce, the court said in Crutcher
v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 57: "Would any one pretend
that a state legislature could prohibit a foreign corporation,-an English or a French transportation company, for
example,-from coming into its borders and landing goods
and passengers at its wharves, and soliciting goods and
passengers for a return voyage, without fii'st obtaining a
license from some state officer, and filing a sworn statement as to the amount of its capital stock paid in? And
why not? Evidently because the matter is not within the
province of state legislation, but within that of national
legislation." Ferry transportation is placed upon the
same footing in this respect by the holding in the Gloucester
Case (supra, pp. 203, 205), the point of the decision being
that the transportation was within the protection of the
constitutional grant to Congress. "It matters not," said
the court, "that the transportation is made in ferry-boats,
which pass between the States every hour of the day."
The fundamental principle involved has been applied
by this court in recent decisions in a great variety of circumstances, and it must be taken to be firmly established
that one otherwise enjoying full capacity for the purpose
cannot be compelled to take out a local license for the
mere privilege of carrying on interstate or foreign commerce. Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, 120 U. S.
489,,496; Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, 645; Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, 129 U. S.141, 148; McCall v. California,

Assuming that, by reason of the local considerations
pertinent to the operation of ferries, there exists in the
absence of Federal action a local protective power to prevent extortion in the rates charged for ferriage from the
shore of the State, and to prescribe reasonable regulations
necessary to secure good order and convenience, we think
that the action of the city in the present case in requiring
the appellee to take out a license, and to pay a license fee,
for the privilege of transacting the business conducted
at its wharf, was beyond the power which the State could
exercise either directly or by delegation. In this view, it
is unnecessary to consider the question raised with respect
to the treaty with Great Britain.
The decree restraining the enforcement of the ordinance
in question as against the appellee is affirmed.
