ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 179.

Argued April 29, 30, 1914.-Deided June 22, 1914.

The provisions in the Ordinance for Government of the Northwest
Territory and subsequent acts of Congress to the effect that navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and, St. Lawrence rivers
shall be common highways and 'forever free to the inhabitants of
that Territory and of the United States do not determine navigability
of any of the streams but only defind rights dependent upon the
existence of navigability.
There is no Federal right involved in the obstruction, or use by private
owners, of a non-navigable stream wholly within a State.
The question of navigability of a river wholly within a State is purely
one of fact, and Where the state court has decided that such a river
is non-navigable there is no right left to review.
A State has no Federal rights which it may exert for itself or on behalf
of its citizens or of all the citizens of the United States in regard to a
river wholly within its boundaries which the highest court of the
State has declared to be non-navigable; nor are any such rights
created by acts of Congress merely authorizing surveys tor and esti'VOL.

Writ of error to review 241 Illinois, 290, dismissed.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
under § 237, Judicial Code, to review a judgment of the
state, court based. on a finding of non-navigability of a
river wholly within the State, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Merritt Starr and Mr. Horace Kent Tenney, with
whom Mr. Elijah N. Zoline, Mr. John S. Miller, Mr.
George Packard and Mr. Harry A. Parkin were on the
brief, for plaintiffs in error:
The Illinois River and its North Fork, the Des Plaines,
are connected with the Chicago River and Lake Michigan
by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. By this means
the Great Lakes are connected. with the Mississippi. The
Ship Canal pours 300,000 ,cubic feet per minute of water
from Lake Michigan into the Des Plaines making it from
6 to 30 feet deep. In this chain of connected navigable
waters the Des Plaihes makes a link 15.6 miles long. In
this link 15.6 miles long the river is from 400 to 600 feet
wide and from 6 to 30 feet deep and descends 38 feet. At
an island it narrows to 128 feet. In Lake Joliet it spreads
out to 1,500 feet in width. A small island which formerly
narrowed one place to 60 feet was blasted out and removed in building the Ship Canal. The narrowest place
is 128 feet wide. At the dam site it is over 300 feet wide
and 6 feet deep and actually navigable throughout. This
15.6 mile link of the Des Plaines receives this increment
by Federal permit granted May 8th, 1899, under act of
Congress of March 3, 1899, and was made navigable
thereby. (U. S., Engrs. Report, 1899, Part I, pp. 40, 41;
Ibid., 1900, Part I, p. 42; Chicago Sanitary District Proceedings, 1899, pp. 5675-6). This permanent change in the
Des Plaines was made January 17, 1900. Defendant did

not buy its riparian lands forming site of proposed dam
on this link of the Des Plaines until December 15, 1906,
after the change was complete, the former owner settled
with for the change, and all claims of damage barred by
the statute of limitations. The state statutes for the
construction of the Ship Canal made full provision for
compensation to riparian owners on the river into which
the canal discharges. (Ill. R. S. 1912, c. 24, pp. 349-359.)
These connecting waters are navigable; and the 15.6
mile link of the Des Plaines is navigable. Escanaba v.

Company, v. Fort, Governor and Attorney General of New
Jersey, 188 Fed. Rep. 993; Minnesota Canal &c. Co. v.
Pratt,101 Minnesota, 197, S. C., 11 L. R. A. (N., S.) 105.
This early commercial use in the fur trade ended with
the Black Hawk War in 1832 and the inrush of immigration that followed. This is the route and this the commerce which was protected by the Ordinance of 1787. In
1836 the State began building the original Illinois and
Michigan Canal and filled it from the Des Plaines, returning the water to the river after a detour of eleven miles.
By this interruption, the old canal superseded the river
commercially- until itself was superseded by the railroads.
The original navigability of the Des Plaines was restored
and enlarged by the discharge into it by Federal authority
of the navigable waters of Lake Michigan. The public
right in this historic waterway is not lost by non-user.
It is inalienable. Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S.
387; People v. Page, 39 1. Y. App. Div. 110; People v.
Vanderbilt, 26 N. Y. 287; S. C., 28 N. Y. 396; Hartford v.
HartfordBridge Co., 10 How. 534.
The defendant demurred to the allegation that the
stream as altered and improved was rendered navigable
in 1900; and the state courts both sustained the demurrer
as a matter of law and held that the artificial navigability
so created was irrelevant and immaterial. Upon this
there was no finding of fact below.
As a matter of law, a stream artificially increased in
volume and otherwise improved by public action is to be
judged thenceforward in its altered condition. Phila. Co.

as to Chicago River so artificially made navigable. In re
Chicago River, 20 Opin. U. S. Atty. Gen. 101.
Federal and state action were concurrent in the improvement of the Des Plaines. The State furnished the
channel at a cost of over $50,000,000, and the Federal
Government furnished the navigable water from Lake
Michigan. By acts of Congress of March 3, 1899 (30
Stat., p. 1121); act of June 6, 1900 (31 Ibid., p. 580);
act of June 13, 1902 (32 Ibid., p. 364); act of June 25,
1902 (36 Ibid., pp. 630, 659-60), Congress has appropriated moneys for the survey and improvement of the
Des Plaines and thereby impressed the Federal character
upon it. That the Federal part of the improvements has
not yet been built is not controlling. It is the act of Congress and not the subsequent act of the laborer in making
the excavation which fixes the Federal character. "When
Congress has by any expression of its will, occupied the
field, that action, i conclusive." Wisconsin v. Duluth,
96 U. S. 379, 387.
The act of Congress of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat.,
p. 1146), specifically appropriates $200,000 for the survey of the Des Plaines, and that of June 25, 1910 (36
Stat., pp. 630, 659-60), appropriates $1,000,000 for its
improvement, upon codperation by the State of Illinois, as
a navigable water of the United States; and §§ 9 and 10
of the former (pp. 1146, 1151) forbid the damming of such
streams. These acts apply to the Des Plaines and give
the State a special interest which it can protect by suit.
The lands constituting the site were canal lands granted
by the U. S. to the State of Illinois for navigation purposes and are impressed with a trust therefor; and the
State while owning the lands enacted the statute of 1839
dedicating the Des Plaines as a highway to be used in

connection with the canal. Such dedication is binding.

States, 174 U. S. 196; Bennett v. Chicago &c. R. Co., 73
Fed. Rep. 696; Union Canal Co. :v. Landis, 9 Watts, 228.
The state legislature to whom Congress confided the
protection of the stream, by the act of December 6, 1907,
ordered this suit brought; and by the act of 1911, ordered
this proceeding to review same in this court.
The existence of similar right of action on the part of
the Federal Government does not divest the right of the
State. Georgiav. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230.
The State has the right, to maintain its suit as parens
patriwe to enforce rights conferred by Federal laws upon
it and its people. Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208,

230; Illinois Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S 387; Am.
Express Co. v. Michigan, 177 U. S. 404.
The State may assert a right in its own courts under
Federal laws and is not concluded by the judgment of its
own court. It is entitled to a writ of error from this court
thereon. New Jersey v. Yard, 95 U. S. 104;'Alabama v.
Schmidt, 232 U. S. 168.
The act of Congress of March 3, 1899, gives the state
legislature the authority to permit or prevent the damming of a stream whose navigable part is in one State.
The action of the state legislature in exercising this
Federal grant of authority presents Federal questions for
review. United States v. Bellingham Boom Co., 176 U. S.
211; Cummings v. Chicago, 188 U. S. 410, 431.
The State, like any other party specially affected by a
breach of Federal law, may maintain suit for its violation.

And the jurisdiction to review the judgment in such

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

234 U. S.

suit is not abridged by the fact that the plaintiff elected
to pursue an ancient remedy in the state court. Belden v.
Chase, 150 U. S. 674, 691. Egan v. Hart, 165 U. S. 138,
does not apply, because there the state court found the
facts, here it sustained a demurrer. Here the entire evidence is certified up and shows facts diametrically opposite to those in Egan v. Hart. There the riparian owner
sought to enjoin the public work, viz.: The erection of a
public levee by concurrent action of state and Federal
Government, from going on. Here the State seeks to
enjoin the riparian owner from obstruction in order that
public work, in which state and Federal Government participate, may go on. The levee in Egan v. Hart was authorized by state legislation, but here the proposed dam
is not so authorized, but on the contrary is forbidden by
state legislation. The bayou in Egan v. Hart connected
with nothing. The Des Plaines connects the Great Lakes
with the Mississippi. There the public levee obstructed
high water only; here the private defendant proposes to
take exclusive occupation of the stream. Egan v. Hart
was decided before the enactment of the act of Congress
of 1899 which establishes a new and different rule.
The judgment of the state court was reached (1) by
erroneously disregarding the permanent improvements
in the stream and attempting to deal with it as in a state
of nature; (2) and by erroneously disregarding the only
available evidence of a state of nature, viz.: That contained in the books of history, geography, travel and
Government survey. The state of nature ceased to exist
in 1833, and there was no living witness in 1908, who
could testify thereto. But although altered, the river
continued in use until 1848. As Federal questions were
involved this court applies its own standards and rules
to the question of navigability and to the evidence.
Mackay v. Dillon, 4 How. 421, 447.
Defendant claims only as a riparian owner whose rights

are subject to the paramount right of, and changing needs

506, 520; Lewis, Oyster &c. Co. v. Briggs, 229 U. S. 82,
affirming 198 N. Y. 287.
The "decision" or "opinion" of the state Supreme
Court on the question of artificial navigability alleged in
the bill and demurred to by defendant, cannot operate as
a finding of facts. Stone v. United States, 164 U. S. 380;
Saltonstall v. Birtwell, 150 U. S. 417; Jackson v. United
States, 230 U. S. 1, 18.
Modern developments of shallow draft navigation by
boats propelled by gasoline and electricity have brought
many streams which were navigated before the use of
steamboats and then temporarily disused back into use
as navigable streams. The variations in the art do not
divest the rights of the public. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564;
Phila. Co. v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634-5; Pennsylvania
Co. v. Wheeling Bridge, 18 How. 421, 431.
Where Federal and state action are interwoven upon a
subject and Federal questions are presented, the decision
of the state court is not conclusive but is reviewable here;
and this court will determine the scope and significance
of the Federal questions and the effect of the evidence
thereon for itself. Missouri v. Elliott, 184 U. S. 530;
Kaukana v. Green Bay Canal, 142 U. S. 254, 269; Green

is to be defined by the Federal courts; and measured and
tested by Federal standards the Des Plaines is and always
has been navigable. The act of May 18, 1796, 1 Stat.
c. 29, pp. 464-9) and the act of Congress of March 26,
1804, 2 Ibid., p. 227, containing these terms and dedicating streams as highways, apply. Des Plaines River Co. v.
Schurmeyer, 7 Wall. 272. What they apply to is a Federal
question for this court to decide. These Acts continued in
force after the admission of Illinois. United States v.
Sandoval,' 231 U. S. 28; United States v. Gratiot, 14 Pet.
34. These acts of Congress were in force long before the
invention of the steamboat and they protect shallow draft
navigation. The defendant by denying the continued
validity of these acts after the admission of Illinois drew
them in question. Sharpleigh v. Surdam, 21 Fed. Cas.
1173-8; Jones v. Walker, 2 Paine, 688; S. C., 13 Fed. Cas.
1059-62. The Illinois courts applied the early established
local definition and standard of navigability, which rejects
rafting, passenger traffic and shallow draft navigation.
Hubbard v. Bell, 54 Illinois' 110; Schulte v. Warren, 218
Illinois, 108. This standard so applied, is in conflict with
the Federal standard as laid down in The Montello, 20
Wall. 430, and The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, and in the
acts of Congress protecting rafting and shallow draft
navigation. Rev. Stat., § 5254. Acts of Congress of

Mr. Frank H. Scott, with whom Mr. Gilbert E. Porter

The question of navigability is purely one of fact;
Egan v. Hart, 165 U. S. 188; and where the state court
denies the existence of facts necessary to bring the case

The provisions of these acts relied on do not refer to
physical -obstructions of navigable streams, but to political regulations which would hamper freedom of commerce, and they do not prohibit the construction of dams,
even though such dams may completely obstruct navigation. Wilson v.Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245;

such acts, the rights of riparian owners are to be measured

River and have the benefit of the increased flow caused by
artificial means. Druley v" Adams, 102 Illinois, 177;
People v. Economy Light & Power Co., 241 Illinois, 290.
The effect of the decision of the state courts that the Des
Plaines River was not a navigable stream at once removed
the question whether plaintiffs in error had any rights
under those acts. 'Those acts apply in terms only to navigable streams, and the decision of the state court that
the river is not navigable made it unnecessary for the
court to pass upon the Federal question, if one existed.

and no question under the act of 1899 was decided by the
state Supreme Court.
Plaintiff in error's contention that the Federal improvement of the Des Plaines River in co6peration with the
State of Illinois, confirms the Federal character of the
stream, is based upon a false premise. No Federal improvement of the Des Plaines River has ever been made,
and the State of Illinois has never taken any steps for the'
improvement of the river. The Sanitary District Act,
which plaintiff in error relies upon, did not include in its
scheme the improvement of the Des Plaines River for.
navigation. The purpose of that act was sanitation, and
up to this time no deep waterway has been attempted
either by the State or the Nation, and hence there has
been no codperation between them. The state Supreme
Court has so held in this case. People v. Economy Power
Co., 241 Illinois, 290, 331.
The acts of Congress of 1899, 1900, 1902, 1910, which
plaintiff in error conte'nds make appropriations for the
improvement of the Des Plaines River and constitutes the
exercise of jurisdiction over that river, merely make appropriations for surveys to determine the feasibility of
improving the Des Plaines and Upper Illinois for navigation. Those acts recognized that the Des Plaines River
was not navigable, and were not the exercise of jurisdiction
over the river.
No permission for the construction of a dam was ever
asked of the War Department or refused by it. The plans
were submitted to the Department for the purpose of
ascertaining whether they were in harmony with the
plans for the deep waterway, and the Department held
that they would be an aid to the deep waterway plans
then under consideration, and would save to the United
States a large sum of money in the construction of a deep
waterway.
. The War Department expressly held that the Des

Plaines River was not navigable, and that the United
States had no jurisdiction over it, and that the act of
1899 did not apply to it. The State of Illinois is not entitled. to restrain the construction of the dam because of
the failure to procure a permit from the War Department
under an act which the War Department has held does
not apply to the stream.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.

This was a proceeding brought in the Circuit Court of
Grundy County, Illinois, being an information filed by
the Attorney General of the State on behalf of the people
of the State on the relation of the Governor, against defendant in error, the Economy Light & Power Company,
to restrain that company from erecting a dam across the
Des Plaines River and from causing the waters of the
river to back up and overflow the lands of the State, to
refrain from permitting the obstructions placed in the
river to remain therein, and that certain deeds, leases and
contracts made by the canal commissioners of the State
to the company be declared null and void. The information was dismissed by the Circuit Court and its decree
was affirmed by the Supreme Court. This writ of error
was then sued out by plaintiffs in error.
A motion is made to dismiss on the grounds-(1) that
no Federal question was decided by the Supreme Court
.adversely to plaintiffs in error. (2) The Federal questions
sought to be raised in this court were not raised in the
trial court and under the practice in Illinoig were not open
to review in the Supreme Court, and were not reviewed.
(3) The Federal questions raised are without merit.
(4) The decision of the Supreme Court is sustainable
upon non-Federal grounds.
The inotion makes necessary a consideration of the

Opinion of the Court.

allegations of the information and of the grounds of decision of the court. The information alleges the following: The State of Illinois was formed out of the Northwest Territory ceded by Virginia to the United States in
1784, and by the ordinaice for the government of the
territory it was declared in Article 4 that "the navigable
waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and
the carrying places between the same, shall be common
highways, -and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of
the said territory as to the citizens of the United States
and those of any other States that may be admitted into
the Confederacy, without any tax, impost or duty therefor."
On May 18, 1796 (1 Stat. 464, c. 29), Congress passed
an act for the sale of lands of the United States in the
territory northwest of the Ohio River and above the
mouth of the Kentucky River, by § 9 of which act it was
provided that all navigable rivers within the territory to
be disposed of by virtue of the act should be deemed to
be and remain public highways. Subsequently there
was separated from such territory by an act of Congress
dated May 7, 1800 (2 Stat. 58, c. 41), the portion thereof
which now embraces the States of Illinois and Louisiana,
to be called Indiana Territory. On March 26, 1804 (2
Stat. 277, c. 35), Congress, acting under the constitution
of 1787, passed an act for the disposal of the public lands
in Indiana Territory, by which it was provided that all
the navigable rivers, creeks and waters within that Territory should be deemed to be and remain public highways.
By an act of February 3, 1809, 2 Stat. 514, c. 13,
Congress divided the Indiana Territory and constituted
that portion of it which now comprises the State of Illinois a separate territory, to be called Illinois, and provided that its inhabitants should be entitled to and enjoy
all and singular the rights, privileges and advantages

granted'and secured to the people of the Northwest Territory by the ordinance of July 13, 1787.
On April 18, 1818 (3 Stat. 428, c. 67), Congress passed
an act to enable the people of Illinois to form a constitution and state government for admission into the Union
upon an equality With other States and provided that the
government should be republican and not repugnant to
the ordinance of July 13, 1787. A: constitution was
adopted and Congress, on December 3, 1818 (3 Stat. 536),
declared the admission of the State into the Union, that
its constitution and government were republican and in
conformity, to the provisions of the articles of compact
between the original States and the people and the States
in the territory northwest of the river Ohio, passed on
July 13, 1787 (1 Stat. 51n.).
The river Des Plaines is situated in the Northwest
Territory, rises in Wisconsin and flows southerly into the
State of Illinois (its course is giv-en), in all a distance of
about ninety-six miles.
The river Kankakee rises in Indiana and flows westerly
into Illinois and unites in Grundy County with the Des
Plaines, forming with it the Illinois which flows thence
westerly and Southwesterly through several counties in
Illinois into the Mississippi River' Wherefore by reason
of the fact that the Des Plaines River is wholly within
the Northwest Territory and that it empties its waters
into the Mississippi, and by reason of the other facts set
forth, it is subject to the provisions of the acts of Congress
set out.
It is shown by early explorations and discoveries that
.the Des Plaines River was navigable from a point near
where is now situated the City of Chicago to its mouth,
and was used as a highway for commercial purposes, and
commerce was carried on over it and over the Chicago
River, located in Cook County, Illinois, and connection
therewith made by a short portage between the two

Opinion of the Court.

rivers near the site of what is now the City of Chicago and
was in use as a highway of commerce leading from Lake
Michigan and the waters emptying into the St. Lawrence
River on the one hand, and the waters of the Mississippi
River on the other, thenceforward from the time of said
first use up to.and at-the time when the ordinance of 1787
and the several acts of Congress were respectively enacted.
Afterward the State of Illinois, by and through its
legislature and in obedience to the several acts of Congress
set forth, assumed charge of the river and in 1839 gave
permission for the building of a toll bridge across the river,
and subsequently by an act passed in 1839 amending the
several laws in relation to the Illinois and Michigan Canal
it was provided that no stream of water passing through
the canal lands should pass by the sale so as to deprive
the State of the use of such water if necessary to supply
the canal without charge for the same; and it was further
provided that the lands situated upon the streams which
have been meandered by the surveys of public lands by.
the United States should be considered as bounded by
the lines of those surveys and not by the streams. In the
same year an act was passed declaring the river a navigable stream and providing that it should be deemed and
held a public highway and should be free, open and unobstructed from its point of connection with the canal to
its utmost limit within the State for the passage of all
boats and water craft of every description.
In 1845 the State authorized the construction and continuance of the mill dam across the.river with reservation
of the right to the State of improving the dam and of using
the water for the canal, and for any other purpose; and
in 1849 authorized the building of a bridge at Lockport.
The State by certain acts of its legislature (they are set
out) created the Sanitary District of Chicago, under the
provision of which a channel was constructed connecting
Lake Michigan with the Des Plaines River, at .a point
VOL. ccxxxiv-33

some sixteen miles above the site of the dam in question,
and through which about 300,000 .cubic feet of water per
minute are drawn through the Chicago River and the
Sanitary District Drainage Channel and discharged in
the Des Plaines River.
It was provided that the channel when completed
should be a navigable stream and that when the General
Government should improve the river it should have full
control over the same for navigation purposes, but not
to interfere with its control for sanitary drainage purposes.
On December 6, 1907, the legislature passed an act,
which is a follows:
"SEc. 1. Be it enacted by the People of the State of
Illinois, represented in the General Assembly: That the
Des Plaines and Illinois rivers throughout their courses
from and below the water power plant of the main channel of the Sanitary District of Chicago in the township of
Ldckport, at or near Lockport, in the county of Will,
are hereby recognized as and are hereby declared to be
navigable streams, and it is made the special duty of the
Governor and the Attorney General to prevent the erection of any structure in or across said streams without
explicit authority from the General Assembly, and the
Governor and Attorney General are hereby authorized
and directed to take the necessary legal action or actions
to remove all and every obstruction now existing in said
rivers that in any wise interferes with the intent and purpose of thisact."
The relator, Charles S. Deneen, is the Governor referred
to in the act and that by virtue of the statute, his office
and constitutional duty he has a special interest and responsibility in the matters set forth.
The purchasers from the State in section 25 and other
similarly situated lands with reference to the Des Plaines
River did not take, and did not claim to take, under their
several purchases that portion of the lands lying between

ILLINOIS v. ECONOMY POWER CO.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the meander line and the water of the river and that the
lands so lying have never been used by any individual
under any claim of authority or right vested in the purchasers from the State of Illinois, save and except as
claimed by defendant. Lands so lying, therefore, together
with the bed of the stream of the river in said quartersection, and other lands similarly situated with reference
to the river, have not passed by any purchase of adjoining
lands from the State of Illinois, but the same and every
part thereof is owned by the State and held for the benefit
of its people and of the people of the United States as a
public highway for commerce.
The trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal executed and delivered to one Charles E. Boyer a deed bearing date October 22, 1860, to land in section 25, excepting
and reserving so much as was occupied by the canal and its
waters, and a strip ninety feet wide on either side of the
canal, containing 196 62-100 acres, the tract being a portion of the land granted by the United States to the State
to aid the State in opening a canal to connect the waters
of the Illinois River with those of Lake Michigan and by
the State granted to the Board of Trustees of the canal
for the purposes set forth in the act of February 21, 1843.
The defendant derives its title by mesne conveyances
from Boyer and certain contracts and leases entered into
between the canal commissioners and one Harold F. Griswold and assigned to defendant, and in pursuance of the
claim of right thus obtained defendant commenced the
construction of a dam across the river, but that the said
several leases, deeds and contracts are ineffectual to confer
any right to build or maintain the dam.
The legislature of the State, by a proper resolution
passed on October 16, 1907, has proposed the building
of a deep waterway commencing at the southern end of
the Chicago Drainage Canal and extending along the
Des Plaines River, to be submitted to a vote of the people

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

of the State, and, if the same is built, as incident thereto
locks and dams will necessarily be constructed across the
deep waterway at or near the S. E. Y of section 25, which
dams will incidentally afford water power of the value of
several millions of dollars to the State which will be lost
to the State if the defendant be permitted to construct
the dam in question.
The 90-foot strip along the line of the Illinois and Michigan Canal constitutes an integral part of the canal and
the trustees of the canal and the canal commissioners of
the State had no right or authority under the law to convey the same by deed, lease or otherwise. Wherefore the
defendant acquired no right to such strip and said deeds,
leases, contracts and other agreements are void so far as
they pertain to the bed of the stream of the river, and
to the lands lying outside of the meander line.
By virtue of the several acts of Congress set forth, the
State is the owner of such lands and other lands similarly
situated. The defendant, claiming to own such lands and
other lands in section 25, has actually begun the erection of
the dam referred to; the Attorney General, therefore, on
December 12, 1907, served notice upon the defendant to
desist from the erection of the dam and from further trespassing upon the lands owned by the State, and to remove
any and all obstructions placed thereon. Defendant has
ignored the notice and unless prevented by injunction will
complete the dam to the great impairment of navigation
and to the great and irreparable damage of the people of
the State.
There are other allegations in regard to the leases and
contracts from the canal commissioners which are not
necessary to be given.
The prayer of the information was for an injunction in
accordance with the allegations.
Defendant in error summarizes its answer as follows:
It denied that the Des Plaines River was or ever had been

ILLINOIS v. ECONOMY POWER CO.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

navigable, and alleged that it never had been navigated
for the purpose of commerce; and also that it had from
the earliest times been completely obstructed by various
bridges and dams built without legislative authority, and
that the State itself had constructed and for many .years.
maintained, and still maintains, a dam, entirely across the
river at Joliet. It set out correspondence with the War
Department of the United States before the construction
of the dam was begun, from which it appeared that the
plans of the proposed structure were submitted to that
Department for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
project would be in harmony with the work of, the improvement of the river proposed-but never decided
upon-by the Government, and that the officers of the
Department stated not only that it would be so in harmony but if carried out it would save the Government
large sums of money. The correspondence also stated
that the river had never yet been considered a navigable
stream of the United States and that it was not subject to
the provision of §§ 9-13 of the act of March 3, 1899 (30
Stat. 1151, c. 425), or to other similar United States legislation.
The answer further alleged that subsequently defendant in error acquired the property and that a large sum of
money had been expended and heavy obligations incurred
by it in carrying out the project of building the dam.
Upon the issues thus made, evidence was, taken, which
composes thrde large volumes upon which the' courts
below decided against plaintiffs in. error; and we are to
consider whether in so doing any Federal right was passed
upon or denied it.
To sustain the contention that such right was passed
upon and denied, it is said "that at the time the information in equity was filed, and for over six years before the
defendant in error became a riparian owner, the Des
Plaines River, irrespective of the question of its naviga-

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

bility, was a navigable river of the United States at the
point where the dam was erected" and this because of the
"concurrent action of the State and Federal Governments by the construction of the Chicago Sanitary Ship
Canal, the connection of it with the Chicago River and
Lake Michigan on the northeast and the discharge of
the water into Lake Michigan from it into Des Plaines
and Illinois on the southwest."
It is further contended that the state court did not
decide this question adversely to plaintiffs in error but,
on the contrary, excluded the admitted fact as being immaterial because that condition was artificially created.
And this because defendant in error urged in that court
that the navigability of the river could not be determined
by its capacity as improved by the addition of the water
of the Sanitary District. The court in its decision, therefore, it is the final contention, denied the rights arising
from the condition of navigability thus created by state
and Federal action, and plaintiffs in error insist that "if
artificial navigability can create a public right which is
entitled ,to protection against the acts of one who purchases
riparian property after that condition was created, then
on the conceded law the judgment of the state court was
erroneous. And if those public rights are created or protected by Federal law, this court has jurisdiction to reverse the judgment."
The inquiry immediately occurs, How did the so-called
public right arise? From the mere addition of water to
the river or by the conditions upon which it was admitted?
The bill alleges the enactment of many laws and a complex system of improvements by virtue of them, rights
asserted by the State to the lands bordering on the river
and rights to the bed of the river, conveyances, leases,
and contracts by public officers constituted by laws which
verbally, at least, confer authority upon them, and rights
asserted by defendant in error arising from the'execution

ILLINOIS v. ECONOMY POWER CO.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of such authority. But all-of the questions hence arising
are state questions, whether depending upon law or fact,
which it is not in our province to review. It would seem,
therefore, at the outset that one of the elements of the
Federal right asserted is absent. However, let us see
what the Supreme.Court of the State has decided.
Mr. Justice Vickers, delivering the opinion of the
court, says, (241 Illinois, p. 309): "Appellant [the State]
bases its claim on three propositions-as follows: (1) That
the State of Illinois owns the bed of the river at the point
where it is proposed to build said dam; (2) That the Des
Plaines River is a navigable stream, and that the proposed
dam would constitute an obstruction to navigation;
(3) That .certain contracts executed by the commissioners
of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, under which appellee
[defendant in error] claims certain rights in connection
with the construction of said dam, are void, and that no
rights were acquired by or can be asserted under said
contracts."
The first and third propositions manifestly involve state
questions and were decided adversely to plaintiffs in
error. They might be put out of discussion except so. far
as they may have bearing on the'second proposition. By
the second proposition the navigability of the river is
presented as a question of fact, and of it the court said
that it had received the most exhaustive treatment by
counsel, and that if the dismissal of the bill by the court
below had been without prejudice to renew the application
for injunction the action of the court could be sustained
because of the utter failure of the plaintiffs in error to
prove that the construction of the proposed dam would
be an obstruction to the then navigation of the river.
"There is no proof," the court said (p. 320), "that the
river is now being used as a public highway for commerce.
On the contrary, the evidence not only shows that the
river is not being do used, but it shows affirmatively that,

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

owing to the presence of numerous other dams and some
fifty or more bridges which span the river, it would be impossible, under existing conditions, to navigate the same.
There being at present no navigation whatever upon the
river, obviously the dam in question cannot be said to be
an obstruction to navigation that has no existence in
fact." The trial court not making the indicated reservation but having rendered a decree based on the finding
that the river was not navigable, thus settling the question for all time, the Supreme Court considered the question as presented on the merits. After a review of the
evidence and the contentions of the parties, it decided
that the river was not navigable in a state of nature, and
declared that there was not in the entire record a well
authenticated instance in which a boat engaged in commerce navigated the waters of the Des Plaines River.
Referring to the testimony, the court said (p. 336), "Whatever may be thought of the preponderance of it one way
or the other, it can have but little weight as against the
uncontroverted fact that the river has never been used as
a public highway for commerce." And again (p. 338),
"After the most careful consideration of this question
we are of the opinion that the Des Plaines River in its
natural condition is not a navigable stream, and that the
rights of parties to this suit must be determined upon that
basis." The court besides rejected the contention that
the Sanitary District Act declared the river to be navigable. The contention, it was said, was "based on a sentence in § 24 of said act, as follows: 'When such channel
shall be completed, and the water*turned therein, to the
amount of 300,000 cubic feet of water per minute, the
same is hereby declared a navigable stream.' Appellant's
[the State] contention, under this statute, is thus stated
in its brief: 'The same means. that the water flowing in
that channel is a navigable stream. The water so turned
in was navigable in fact, and it does not lose its naviga-

ILLINOIS v. ECONOMY POWER CO.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

bility in passing out of the artificial channel into the channel of the Des Plaines River. The water is just as navigable one-half mile southwest of Joliet as it is one-half
mile northeast of Joliet.' The argument is based upon
an erroneous construction of the word 'same.' That
term refers to the channel of the Sanitary District and
has no reference to the water after it leaves the channel" (p. 329).
The court, however, said that even if the legislature
had declared in unequivocal language that the river was
navigable, as it did by the act of 1907 [the act under
which the information was filed], the declaration could
not affect the rights of defendant in error, they being
protected by the constitution of the State which forbids
private property from being taken for public use without
just compensation previously made, for which the court
cited a number of cases and Cooley on Constitutional
Limitations (side p. 591). And it was added that none
of the legislative acts had the primary purpose of permitting a deep-water channel from the Lakes to the Gulf
by means of improving the channel of the Des Plaines
River, nor did the various acts passed in the interest of
the Illinois and Michigan Canal nor the Sanitary District
Act include a general scheme for the improvement of that
river. "Up to this time,"' it was further said (p. 331),
"no general plan for the deep waterway has been adopted,
either by the State or the Nation," and whether any such
enterprise will ever be adopted and whether it will include
the Des Plaines River "are all legislative questions, with
which the courts have no concern." If it be done, the
court continued, it must be (lone "with due regard
.
to the sacred rights of every citizen, however humble
and insignificant those rights may seem in contrast with
the great public consummation."
We have already seen that the contention of the plaintiff in error that the bed of the river was in the State and

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

not in the riparian owners, among whom is defendant in
error, by force of the act of the legislature of the State
of February 26, 1839, in relation to the Illinois and Michigan Canal, was held untenable, and it was further held
that the contracts of the canal commissioners under which
defendant in error claims rights were valid. And the
court further decided that the legislation of the State did
not intend nor contemplate the improvement of the Des
Plaines River from a condition of non-navigability to
navigability and no act, except that of.1907, had declared
it to be navigable, and that no act could do so and affect
private rights under the constitution of the State. The
•supreme tribunal of the State, has, therefore, decided
that plaintiffs in error have no elements of right against
defendant in error.
It is said, however, as a foundation of a right under the
acts of Congress alleged, that the river, although it was
not navigable in its natural state became so by the addition of water from the Sanitary District. This contention was rejected by the Supreme Court, the court deciding, as we have seen, that the navigability of the river
was to be determined by its natural condition and not by
its condition created by artificial means. In resistance to
this conclusion of the court and in assertion of a Federal
right, plaintiffs in error cite, besides the acts of Congress
referred to in the information certain acts of Congress
passed in 1899, 1900 and 1902 appropriating money for
."a survey and estimates of cost for the improvement of
the upper Illinois and lower Des Plaines Rivers in Illinois,
with a view to the extension of navigation from the Illinois
River to Lake Michigan," and adduce, besides other recognitions by Congress of the navigability of the river, and
contend that therefore, the rights of the State are based
on Federal laws, and "that in its sovereign right, and as
parens patriae and of its citizens, and on behalf of the
citizens of all of the United States [italics counsel's], it had

ILLINOIS v. ECONOMY POWER CO.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the right ur4der those Federal laws to prevent the accomplishment by defendant of an act destructive of the navigability of the stream."
Plaintiffs in error state their contention another way.
They say the acts of the two sovereignties, state and National, in furtherance of a common object, are so inter-.
woven and related that the rights and questions arising
from them, and the construction of their effect necessarily
create.Federal questions.
But we have seen that the Supreme Court of the State
decided there was no concurrence of the State in furtherance of the so-called common object, that is, that the
various acts in regard to the Illinois and Michigan Canal
or the Sanitary District did not include any general scheme
for the improvement of the Des Plaines River, and it
was certainly within the competency of the court to so
determine. The court was also of the view'that under
the constitution of the State the State did not have the
"sovereign right, and as parens patriae" to restrain the
acts of defendant in error.
The court seemed to consider that it had decided all of
the contentions of the State when it had decided the question of the navigability of the river both in its natural
condition and its condition after the -addition of the waters
of the Sanitary District. The fact was and is pivotal.
The. ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory and the subsequent acts of Congress set out in the
information do not deternine navigability of the streams
but only define rights which depend upon its existence.
Passing the question, therefore whether the ordinance or
the acts refer to physical obstructions or to political regulations, and also passing the question whether they were of
force after the admission of the State into the Union (on.
both questions see Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch,
125 U. S. 1), the fact oi navigability having been decided
against the State by the state court, there is no Federal

right left to review. Crary v. Devlin, 154 U. S.619; Cameron v. United States, 146 U. S. 533; Egan v. Hart, 165
U. S. 188. In the latter case it was decided that the question of navigability is purely one of fact.
It is said, however, that by the acts of 1899, 1900 and
1902 Congress has taken jurisdiction of the Des Plaines
River. If so, the State is not the instrument through
which the jurisdiction can be exercised. United States v.
Bellingham Bay Boom Co., 176 U. S.211; Willamette Iron
Bridge Co. v. Hatch, supra; Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric
Ry. Co., 201 U. S. 529.
But the cited acts are not appropriations for improvements updertaken but for improvements which may be
undertaken; not a jurisdiction exercised but a jurisdiction
to be exercised. And, as we have seen, it is alleged in the
answer, and the allegation is sustained by the evidence,
that the plans of defendant in error's structure were submitted to the War Department and it was declared by
that department, "The work proposed is in general harmony with the work of improvement recommended by
the Board of Engineers appointed under the authority of
the Rivers and Harbors Act of June 13, 1902 (32 Stat.
331, 334, c. 1079)." But the department, inasmuch as,
Congress had not authorized the improvement of the
river, did "not deem it expedient to take further and
definite action in the matter of approving the plans." It
is manifest, therefore, that the State has no right under
Federal laws which it may assert for itself or "on behalf
of the citizens of all of the United States," and the motion
to dismiss must be granted.
Dismissed.
