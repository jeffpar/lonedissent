the Government the Baca claimants gave up their rights
to a definite tract of land, and, as appellees say, expressing
the equities of the claimants, whatever its character or
condition, and the Government therefore would naturally
make provision for the location of the substituted land
as expeditiously as possible and without expense to the
Baca heirs. We therefore think the act of 1860, not that
of 1862, applied.
The contention that appellees have not shown sufficient
title is untenable.
Decree affirmed.

WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY v.
BROWN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF SOUTH
CAROLINA.
No. 355.

Argued May 5, 1914.-Decided June 22, 1914.

A recovery in one jurisdiction for a tort committed in another must be
based on the ground of an obligation incurred at the place of the tort
which is not only the ground, but the measure, of the maximum
recovery.
A State cannot legislate so as to affect conduct outside of its jurisdiction and within territory over which the United States has exclusive
jurisdiction.
A State may not determine the conduct required of a telegraph company in transmitting interstate messages by determining the consequences of not pursuing such conduct in another State.
The statute of South Carolina making mental anguish caused by the
negligent non-delivery of a telegram a cause of action is, as applied
to telegrams the negligent non-delivery of which occurred in the
District of Columbia, an unconstitutional attempt to regulate conduct within territory wholly under the jurisdiction of the United

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

States; such statute is also unconstitutional, as to messages sent
from that State to be delivered in another State, as an attempt to
regulate interstate commerce.
92 So. Car. 554, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of a
statute of the State of South Carolina in regard to negligent non-delivery of telegraph messages, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Rush Taggart and Mr. Francis Raymond Stark,
with whom Mr. George E.Fearonsand Mr. JulianMitchell
were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The statute is unconstitutional, as to interstate messages at least, under the commerce clause, where there has
been no breach of duty by the telegraph company within
the State. In this case there was no breach in South Carolina.
The message was interstate commerce and not subject
to regulation by the State of South Carolina.
Any statute is an invalid regulation of interstate commerce which imposes a liability outside of that created
by the contract and unknown to the common law for an
act or omission occurring in the course of interstate transportation or transmission entirely outside the borders of
the State. West. Un. Tel. Co. V. Commercial Milling Co.,

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

Commercial Milling Co., 218 U. S.406; West. Un. Tel Co.
v. Crovo, 220 U. S. 364.
The statute in controversy in no way attempts to regulate interstate commerce. West. Un. Tel. Co. v. Pendleton,
122 U. S.347, is not applicable and West. Un. Tel. Co. v.
Commercial Milling Co., 218 U. S. 406, is.
The statute does not deny to telegraph companies the
equal protection of the laws.
The statute does not conflict with the exclusive power
of the Congress in the District of Columbia.
MR. JUsTIcE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is an action of tort brought by the party to whom a
telegraphic message was addressed. The message was
delivered to the Company in South Carolina, addressed
to the plaintiff in Washington, D. C., and read "Come at
once. Your sister died this morning.' It was forwarded
without delay to Washington; but there, through negligence as the jury found, was not delivered. The declaration alleges that the failure caused the plaintiff to miss
attending her sister's funeral in South Carolina, and subjected the plaintiff to mental anguish, which of itself is
made a cause of action by a statute of South Carolina.
Civil Code, 1902, § 2223. The defendants in error state
that the action was brought under this section. There
was a trial at which, by the instructions to the jury, a
recovery was allowed under the act for the negligence in
Washington irrespective of the law prevailing here. The
jury found a verdict for $750, which was sustained by
the Supreme Court of the State. 92 So. Car. 354. The
plaintiff in error saved its rights under the Constitution
of the United States (so plainly that it is not necessary
to discuss the matter) and brought the case here.
Whatever variations of opinion and practice there may

Opinion of the Court.

have been, it is established as the law of this court that
when a person recovers in one jurisdiction for a tort committed in another he does so on the ground of an obligation incurred at the place of the tort that accompanies
the person of the defendant elsewhere, and that is not
only the ground but the measure of the maximum recovery. Slater v. Mexican National R. R. Co., 194 U. S.
120, 126. Cuba R. R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 478, 480.
(A limitation of liability may stand on different grounds.
The Titanic, 233 U. S. 718.) The injustice of imposing a
greater liability than that; created by the law governing
the conduct of the parties at the time of the act or omission complained of is obvious; and when a State attempts
in this manner to affect conduct outside its jurisdiction
or the consequences of such conduct, and to infringe upon
the power of the United States, it must fail. The principle would be illustrated by supposing a direct clash between the state and Federal statutes, but it is the same
whenever the State undertakes to go beyond its juridiction into territory where the United States has exclusive
control. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Chiles, 214 U. S.
274; see also Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Commercial
Milling Co., 218 U. S. 406, 416.
What we have said is enough to dispose of the case.
But the act also is objectionable in its aspect of an attempt
to regulate commerce among the States. That is, as construed, it attempts to deternine the conduct required of
the telegraph company in transmitting a message from
one State to another or to this District by determining
the consequences of not pursuing such conduct, and in
that way encounters Western Union Telegraph Co. v.
Pendleton, 122 U. S. 347, a decision in no way qualified by
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Commercial Milling Co.,
218 U. S. 406.
Judgment reversed.
