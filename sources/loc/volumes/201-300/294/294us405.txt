and the cargo under the "Jason clause" bear their proportionate shares of the expenses gives Sucarseco no
ground for a contention that the expenses themselves, or
the share that cargo bears, were not occasioned directly
by the tort. In the light of the nature of the general average contributions, and of the event which made them
necessary, the fact that they were made under the stipulation in the "Jason clause" is no more a defense to Sucarseco than is the fact that the cargo ivas placed on board
under a contract to carry it. Indeed, Sucarseco makes no
contention of immunity. The question arises only because, through recovery by the cargo owners from Sucarseco, Toluma's share of the ultimate division is affected.
But that does not establish remoteness. We have the
anomalous situation that it is Toluma that is .opposing the
cargo owners' claim against Sucarseco, while Toluma has
collected from cargo its share- of the general average expenses on the ground that they were incurred on cargo's
behalf and were due to tJie collision.
As we have said, the "Jason clause" merely distributed
a loss for which Sucarseco was responsible and in that
view the cargo owners are entitled to recover that part of
the loss which they have sustained.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

Statement of the Case.

294 T. S.

3. The power in a State to require a railroad company to bear
expenses of separating the grades of the railway and a new highway at crossing is not absolute but is subject to the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it does not exist in
the particular case if, upon the facts of that case, the exaction
would, be unreasonable or arbitrary. P. 413.
4. In resisting an imposition upon it, under a state statute, of onehalf the cost of an underpass to separate the grades of its main
-line and a proposed new highway, the railway company adduced,
among other facts, that the highway was designed for high-speed
through motor traffic across the State, as part of the national
system of Federal-aid highways largely planned, financed and
supervised by the Federal Government; that it had no local
significance; -that from the local standpoint there was no need of
grade separation;, that the underpass was prescribed, not upon
consideration of local safety needs,. but in conformity to general
plans of the federal and state highway engineers, as being a proper
engineering feature in the construction of a nation-wide system of
highways for high-speed motor vehicle transportation; that the
'highway would be the greater source of danger; that, far from
-being a feeder of railway traffic, it would add to the motor competition from which the railway had already suffered severely;
and that the tax burden upon the railway was already excessive
as compared with that upon the owners of motor vehicles who
would use the highway as it competitors. Held:
(1) That the State Supreme Court erred in not considering
whether the facts showed that the imposition was arbitrary and
unreasonable. Pp. 415, 428.
(2) This question should be determined in the first instance by
the state court. P. 433.
(3) The state court should also decide whether findings of
facts were adequately supported by evidence. Id.
5, When the scope of the police power is in question, the special
knowledge -of local conditions possesed by the state tribunals
may be of great weight. Id.

Argument for Appellant.

Mr.FitzgeraldHall for app6llant.
A statute may be reasonable and, therefore, valid at
one time or under one set of circumstances, yet unreasonable and, therefore, invalid under different circumstances.
A statute may be perfectly valid on its face, yet, applied
to given facts, be invalid. While the fundamental principles of the organic law of the Nation remain unchanged,
their application to changing conditions must and does
call for a restatement of ancient and obsolete rules.

Argument for Appellant.

294 U. S.

If the power exercised was not police, it follows as of
course that taking appellant's money to finance the underpass was a taking of private property without due
process of law.
The Government of the United States, under the commerce and post roads provisions of the Federal Constitution, may build and construct post roads, but it has no
police power, except in the District of Columbia and possibly some territories not a part of any one of the several
States. United States v. DeWitt, 9 Wall. 41, 45; Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 97 U. S. 659, 667; Hart Coal Co. v.

Any exercise of the police power requires investigation
and knowledge of the factors involving safety, as distinguished from mere traffic considerations. Southern
Ry. Co. v. Virginia, 290 U. S. 190.
The difference between the engineering and traffic considerations for making a highway safe and convenient for
commercial business thereon, and a legitimate exercise of
the police power, has been recognized in several recent
cases. Chicago & N,. W. Ry. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n,
205 Wis. 506; Sidney v. Wabash Ry. Co., 333 Ill. 126;

Transit Comm'n v. United States, 284 U. S. 360; Chicago, St. P., M. & 0. Ry. Co. v. Holmberg, 282 U. S. 162.
This Court and state courts have, in the past, frequently held that a railroad could be required, to separate
a grade crossing at its sole expense. Such cases are no
longer controlling where the evidence shows that conditions have entirely changed and that commercial convenience of motor traffic rather than public safety is the
motivating and controlling influence of action.
An exercise of the police power is subject to the due
Drocess of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Interstate Commerce Commission, in a series of
elaborate investigations recently held, has officially recognized that which is of common knowledge, namely, that
commercial transportation by motor vehicle, enormous in
proportions, is in active and successful competition with
the railroads.
This Court, taking judicial knowledge of the growth of
commercial transportation by motor vehicle, has recognized the necessity and legality of state action designed
in part to protect commerce by railroad from destruction
by unregulated, competing, commercial motor transportation. Railroad Improvement District v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 274 U. S. 188, 194; Continental Baking Co. v.

MR. JUSTICE

BRANDEIs delivered the. opinion of the

Court.
This suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act
of Tennessee,' was brought, on November 21, 1931, in the
Chancery Court of Davidson County, Part One, by the
Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway against the
State Highway Commissioner and the Attorney General.
The purpose of the suit is to secure a determination of the
constitutionality of. an order entered by the Commission
and, as so applied, of Chapter 132 of the Tennessee Acts
of 1921, upon which the order rests.2 The statute authorizes the Commission whenever a state highway crosses
a railroad to require the separation of grades if in its discretion " the elimination of any such grade crossing is necessary for the protection of persons travelling on any such
highway or any such railroad "; and, without conferring
upon the Commission any discretion as to the proportion
of the cost to be borne by the railroad, requires the latter
to pay in every case, one-half of the total cost of the separation of grades. The order requires the Railway to construct an underpass so as to separate grades where a
proposed state highway will cross its main line within the
limits of bae little town of Lexington; and to bear one-half
the cost thereof.

2Public

Opinion of the Court.

The Railway does not question the power of the State
to build the proposed highway; nor its power to require
the separation of grades; nor the appropriateness of the
plan adopted for such separation; nor the reasonableness
of the cost-$17,400. It does not deny that if the proposed highway is built, safety of travel thereon and on
the-railroad will be promoted by separation of grades. It
concedes that in Tennessee, as elsewhere, the rule has long
been settled that, ordinarily, the State may, under its police power, impose upon a railroad the whole cost of eliminating a grade crossing, or such part thereof, as it deems
appropriate.3 The claim of unconstitutionality rests
wholly upon the special facts here shown. The main contention is that to impose upon the Railway, under these
circumstances, one-half of the cost is action so arbitrary
and unreasonable as to deprive it of property without due
process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The bill of complaint sets forth in detail the facts relied
upon as showing that the action was arbitrary and unreasonable. The answer justifies the imposition solely as an
exercise of the police power. Because many of the alleSee Dyer County v. Railroad, 87 Tenn. 712; 11 S. W. 943; Harriman v. Southern Ry. Co., 111 Tenn. 538; 82 S. W. 213; Chattanooga

gations of the bill were denied, much evidence was introduced. That contained in the printed record in this Court
occupies, with exhibits; 492 pages. The trial court found
that, with one exception,4 the evidence fully supported
every averment of fact in the bill. It held that the order
and the statute as applied, in so far as they require the
Railway to pay one-half the cost of the underpass, are
arbitrary and unreasonable; and that they are void. The
decree enjoined the Commissioner from attempting to enforce payment by the Railway; ordered that the entire
cost of the project (except for contributions by the Federal
Government) be borne by the State Highway Commission; and directed the defendants to pay the costs of the
cause. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of the State reversed that decree; ordered the bill dismissed; and allowed
an appeal to this Court. 167 Tenn. 470; 71 S. W. (2d)
678. Consideration of the jurisdiction thereof was ordered postponed to the hearing on the merits.
The Supreme Court declined to consider the special facts
relied upon as showing that the order, and the statute as
applied, were arbitrary and unreasonable; and did not pass
upon the question whether the evidence sustained those
findings. It held that the statute was, upon its face, constitutional; that when it was passed the State had, in the
.exercise of its police power, authority to impose upon railroads one-half of the cost of eliminating existing or future
grade crossings; and that the Court could not" any more"
consider "whether the provisions of the act in question
have been rendered burdensome or unreasonable by
changed economic and transportation conditions," than it
"It was alleged in the bill that the construction of the underpass
was unnecessary. The decree recites: "The court fihds from *the
evidence that there are no facts to sustain this averment and that in
the interest of commerce by motor vehicle on the public highways,
this was a proper engineering project, properly conceived, located,
designed and constructed."

Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

upon the Railway one-half of the cost of the underpass
was arbitrary and unreasonable, the Supreme Court obviously erred in refusing to consider them. The charge
of arbitrariness is based primarily upon the revolutionary
changes incident to transportation wrought in recent years
by the widespread introduction of motor vehicles; the assumption by the Federal Government of the functions of
road builder; the resulting depletion of rail revenues; the
change in the ch:racter, the construction and the use of
highways; the change in the occasion for elimination of
grade crossings, in the purpose of such elimination, and ill
the chief beneficiaries thereof; and the change in the relative responsibility of the railroads and vehicles moving on
the highways as elements of danger and causes of accidents. The facts specifically found, or of which the courts
could take judicial notice, are these:
1. The decree of the trial court recites, as a finding upon
the evidence, "that this underpass is a part of a state-wide
and nation-wide plan to foster commerce by motor vehicle
on the public highways, the result of which is to afford
competition with railroads and that the decision to build
this underpass, its location and construction, was not in
any proper sense an exercise of the police power, but
rather, as set forth in the bill of complaint, pursuant to a
general plan of internal improvement fostered by the Congress of the United States in conjunction with the several
States to make a nation-wide system of super-highways in
the interest of interstate commerce by motor vehicle, much
of which is in active competition with the railroads themselves "; " that in the interest of commerce by motor vehicles on the public highways, this was a proper engineering project, properly conceived, located, designed and
constructed "; but "that this underpass did not involve an
exercise of the police power any more than many other features of this project, such as elimination of curves, grades,
widening the pavement et cetera."

405

Opinion of the Court.

2. The State highways of Tennessee (as distinguished
from county and city roads and turnpikes) have their
origin in the Federal-aid highway legislation.' The aim
of that legislation is "a connected system of roads for the
whole Nation "; "to provide complete and economical
highway transport throughout the Nation "; to furnish
"a new means of transportation, no less important to the
country as a whole than that offered by the railroads "; '
to establish "lines of motor traffic in interstate commerce." 10 The immediate interest of the Federal Government is, in part, the national defense as well as the
transportation of the mails." The relief of the unemployment incident to the business depression has been the
main incentive for highway construction since April 4,
1930-the period in which the highway here in question
was undertaken and completed.12
To achieve its purposes, the Federal Government has
made large contributions to the cost of the Federal-aid
highway system. In each year, it has made to each State

an expensive but urgently required improvement and on densely

Opinion of the Court.

It is the railroad which now requires protection from dangers incident to motor transportation. Prior to the establishment of the Federal-aid system, Tennessee highways
were built under the direction of the county courts, and
paid for out of funds raised locally by taxation or otherwise." They served, in the main, local traffic. The long
distance traffic was served almost wholly by the railroads
and the water lines. Under those conditions the occasion
for separation of grades was mainly the danger incident
to rail operations; and the promotion of safety was then,
the main purpose of grade separation. Then, it was reasonable to impose upon the railroad a large part of the
cost of eliminating grade crossings; and the imposition
was rarely a hardship. For the need for eliminating existing crossings, and the need of new highways free from
grade crossings, arose usually from the growth of the community in which the grade separation was made,; this
growth was mainly the result of the transportation facilities offered through the railroad; the separation of grade
crossings was a normal incident of the growth of rail operations; and as the highways were then feeders of rail
traffic, the community's growth and every improvement of
highway facilities benefited the railroad. The effect upon
the railroad of constructing Federal-aid highways, like
that here in question, is entirely different. They are not
feeders of rail traffic. They deplete the existing rail traffic and the revenues of the railroads. Separation of grades
serves to intensify -the motor competition and to further
deplete rail traffic. The avoidance thereby made possible
railroad trains; of the persons injured, only one-half of 1% (.5%)
were injured in such collisions. See pamphlet entitled "Thou Shalt
Not Kill," p. 5, issued by The Travelers. Insurance Co., February,
1935.

of traffic interruptions incident to crossing at grade is
now of far greater importance to the highway users than
it is to the railroad crossed. For the rail operations are
few; fhose of motor vehicles very numerous.
4. Lexington is a rural community of 1,823 inhabitants
located in a sparsely settled territory. The construction
of the new highway with the underpass was not designated to meet local transportation needs. It was undertaken to serve as a link in a nation-wide system of highways.,' State Highway No. 20, as formerly routed,
passed through Lexington on Clifton Street, and crossed
the railroad at grade; it was adequate for the existing
traffic and that to be expected. The traffic on that highway was, and is, small. The grade crossing has presented
no serious interruption to traffic. The trains are infrequent. Only six trains are operated now each way in
every twenty-four hours; five of these moving between
10 P. M. and 6 A. M., when there is substantially no highway travel.2 The grade crossing on the old route is protected by the most modern electrical device. That the
crossing is not dangerous is attested by the fact that during the ten years following January 1, 1921, there were
but two minor accidents; and these were settled for $50.
That the present facilitiss are deemed locally both safe
and adequate is attested by the fact that neither the city
authorities, nor any one else, has suggested elimination of
this grade crossing; that the grade crossing is to remain
The old Highway No. 20, from, Perryville, on the Tennessee
River, to Lexington, is a winding gravel road which pat es through
several towns and crosses he Railway eight times at grade. The
new route is a comparatively straight, paved road, crossing the river
a short distance above Perryville, avoiding some of the towns served'
by the old road, and crossing the Railway only at the Lexington
underpass.

unchanged after-the new highway is put into use; and
that the Clifton Street route will continue to be used for
the local traffic.3
5. The underpass required is for a new and additional
highway over which State Highway No. 20 is being rerouted, which will be a part of a Federal-aid route between
Nashville and Memphis, the best route between those two
cities; and which will connect at these termini with highways extending into other States. This highway was
planned by the State Highway Department, acting in
conjunction with the Bureau of Public Roads of the Federal Government. It is part of the secondary or intercounty system; but because of the expected traffic, the
district engineer of the Bureau of Roads, in recommending
its approval, characterized it as a route of primary importance. The underpass was prescribed, not upon consideration of local safety needs, but in conformity to general plans of the federal and state highway engineers, as
being a proper engineering feature in the construction of
a nation-wide system of highways for high speed motor
vehicle transportation; and because it is the policy of the
federal authorities to make the avoidance of grade crossings a condition of a grant in aid of construction. The
requirement of the underpass, and the payment by the
Railway under the 1921 Tennessee Act of one-half the
cost of separating the grades, are results of the Federalaid legislation. Final payment of Federal aid on this
project was conditioned upon commencement of the construction of this underpass.
"On February 16, 1933, while this suit was still in progress in the
trial court, the new Route No. 20, between Perryville and Lexington,
was opened to traffic, although a part of the Highway No. 100, connecting Route 20 with Nashville, was not yet paved. A witness for
the railroad testified that traffic counts, taken on May 2 and 3, 1933,
at the old Clifton Street crossing and at the new underpass, which is
on the outskirts of the town, indicated that the underpass was then
diverting only 20% of the traffic from the grade crossing.

6. The new highway, paralleling lines of the Railway
and intended for rapid-moving motor vehicles, will,
through competition for both freight and passenger traffic,
seriously decrease rail traffic and deplete the Railway's
revenue and net earnings. Practically all vehicles moving
upon it will directly or indirectly compete for traffic with
the Railway. 4 Buses will operate over the new highway
in regular scheduled movements in the same way as passenger trains. Trucks, some of them 7 feet in length and
many weighing with load as much as 50,000 pounds, operated by common carriers, by contract carriers and by
private concerns, will compete for the most profitable
classes of freight. The competition besides reducing the
volume of traffic will compel reduction of rates.
How disastrously such competition will affect the Railway's traffic and revenues is shown by its own experience
since the State commenced, with the aid of the Federal
Government, a system of highways paralleling the lines of
the Railway. The gross passenger revenue fell from
$5,661,011.08 in 1920 to $2,095,942.29 in 1930; and to
$1,139,238 in the first nine months of 1931. The Railway
carried, in 1920, 4,385,630 revenue pasengers; iu 1930 only
680,347; and in the firstnine months of 1931, only 370,445.
The Railway's freight traffic experienced a similar decline.
Of the less-than-carload freight, more than two-thirds was
diverted from the' railroads to motor trucks. In many
" The report of the District Engineer of the Bureau of Public
Roads states: "When the Nashville to Linden connection is completed and the balance of this route to Jackson paved, it is expected
that a large percentage of the traffic now using State Route No. 1,
between Nashville and Jackson, will be diverted to this route, and
it is confidently expected that several thousand vehicles will- be using
thp route in the near future." The Railway introduced in'evidence
trafAc counts on Route 1, showing the weekday foreign traffic amounting to 13% and 23% of the total motor vehicle traffic; and truck
and 'bus traffic amounting to .16% and.19% of the total,

classes of carload traffic similar decreases were experienced
by rail carriers. In 1921, the railroads brought into Nashville 5,689 cars of livestock-being 69.79 per cent of the
total. In 193b, they brought in only 641 cars, being 2i.24
per cent of the total. That the decrease in the Railway's
traffic was due mainly to increased motor competition following the construction of the new highways, appears
from the fact that the decrease began while general business was active; and that, even in the years of economic
depression, the Railway's freight traffic was practically
constant in the relatively few regions where its rail lines
were not paralleled by hard surfaced highways; and that
traffic increased when highways paralleling its lines were
temporarily closed for reconstruction. The reduction in
traffic and depletion in revenues has been particularly
severe during the three years preceding 1933.
7. While the Railway, the sufferer from the construction of the new highway, is burdened with one-half the cost
of the underpass, the owners of trucks and buses and
others, who are beneficiaries of its construction, are immune from making any direct contribution toward the
cost. It is true that one-half of the cost is by law to be
borne by the highway fund of Tennessee (except in so far
as it may be covered by the Federal aid),"5 and that the
truck and bus owners and others contribute as taxpayers
to that fund. But, while nearly 28 per cent. of the gross
revenues of the Railway is required annually to pay the
state and local taxes and the cost of maintaining the roadway acquired and constructed at its own expense, the
state commercial motor carriers, which are supplied by
the State with the roadway on which they move, pay in
MThe acting chief of the Bureau of Public Roads stated in reply to
a letter of the Railway's counsel, that he knew of no reason why the
Federal Government would not, upon proper request, pay one-half of
the cost of the underpass if it conformed to the Bureau's requirements.

state and local taxes not more than 7 per cent. of their
gross revenues. The taxes laid upon truck and bus owners are clearly insufficient to p~y their fair share even of
the cost and maintenance of the highways which serve
them. Motor vehicle taxes of all kinds, ad valorem, privilege, license plate, and others, will not pay for one-half of
the annual expenditure in Tennessee for highways. The
balance is being paid in part by general property taxes, in
part by borrowing and in part by the Federal Government. Of the ad valorem taxes paid by the Railway to
the State and the political divisions thereof, about 20 per
cent. is allocated directly to roads, some of which are no
longer feeders to its traffic, but serve as highways for the
traffic taken by its competitors. The relative pro rata tax
burden laid upon common carriers by motor vehicle is
alleged to be one-fourth of that laid upon the railroads.
Second. The Supreme Court of Tennessee erred in refusing to consider whether the facts relied upon by the
Railway established as arbitrary and unreasonable the imposition upon it of one-half the cost of the underpass.
The promotion of public convenience will not justify requiring of a railroad, any more than of others, the expenditure of money, unless it can be shown that a duty to proThe principal taxes paid by motor vehicle owners in Tennessee
are the registration fees and gasoline taxes, the proceeds of which
are used mainly for highway purposes. See Reports of State Highway
Commissioner (1932) pp. 27, 32-3, 241, 285; (1934) pp. 22, 23, 199,
221. Besides these, the state levies a mileage tax upon commercial
vehicles. Mileage taxes collected from intrastate operators go into
the general state funds; those collected from interstate operators,
into the highway fund. In 1932, it was testified, this tax yielded a
gross revenue of approximately $100,000; and a net revenue of $40,000
for the general fund, and $18,000 for the highway fund. The ad
valorem taxes paid by common carrier motor vehicles are negligible.
In 44 of the richest counties, they aggregated in 1928, $1,371.97; in
1929, $1,714.01; in 1930, $1,185.04.

wrought by motor vehicle transportation and the creation

the local conditions at Lexington; tha character of the
place where the underpass was ordered built; the extent
of the railroad operations there; the character of the existing highway facilities, and of their use at that point; the
location of the proposed highway; the occasion for its construction; the use contemplated; the reason why the underpass was ordered; the depletion of the Railway's revenues resulting from the construction of federal-aided
highways, particularly in recent years; the necessary effect
of this new highway upon its rail traffic and revenues; and
the burden of taxation already borne by the Railway as
compared with that of the owners of the motor vehicles
who will use the new highway. No case involving like
conditions has been found in any of the lower federal
courts; nor,* excepting the case here under review, has
any such been found among the decisions of the highest
courts of any State."0
In Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Commissioners, 278 U. S. 24, the crossing was over a state highway, which had priginally been an "ancient

Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

The Supreme Court of Tennessee did not consider
whether in view of the facts relied upon, it was arbitrary
and unreasonable to impose upon the Railway one-half
the cost of the underpass. It assumed that the state action was valid because it found that the action was taken
"to promote the safety of persons "traveling the highways
at grade crossings as well as to promote the safety of persons traveling the railroads at such crossings by eliminating dangerous grade crossings "; and added: "Admitting the insistence of complainant that the primary object of highway construction and the object of federal
contribution to highways is to invite and stimulate interstate traffic or travel upon the highways, it does not follow
that the State roads are not primarily designed to serve
the people of the State."
Third. We have no occasion to consider now whether
the facts presented by the Railway were of such persuasiveness as to have required the state court to hold
modem state highways, in several instances Federal-aid highways,
were unsuccessfully challenged as unconstitutional under the particular circumstances; but in none of them, so far as appears, was the
charge of arbitrariness supported on a record embodying facts similar to those presented above. Chicago, N. S. & M. R. Co. v. Illinois

that the statute and order complained of are arbitrary
and unreasonable. That determination should, in the
first instance, be made by the Supreme Court of the State.
Compare Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, 260
U. S.441, 447; Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair,264 U. S.543,
548-9; Twist v. PrairieOil Co., 274 U. S.684, 692; Grant
v. Leach & -Co., 280 U. S. 351, 363."- Moreover, since
that court held the facts relied upon to be without legal
significance, it did not enquire whether the findings were
adequately supported by the evidence introduced in the
trial court. The correctness of some of the findings is
controverted by the State. Other facts of importance
-bearing upon the issue may possibly be deducible from the
evidence, or be within the judicial knowledge of that
court. When the scope of the police power is in question
the special knowledge of local conditions possessed by the
state tribunals may be of great weight. Compare Welch
v. Swasey, 214 U. S.91, 105, 106;.Laurel Hill Cemetery v.
San Francisco,216 U. S.358, 365.
We have also no occasion to consider whether the Railway should bear a proportion of the cost of the underpass
less than one-half. The propriety of a lesser charge was
*not, and could not have been, considered by the Commission; and it was not -considered by either of the lower
courts. It was conceded by counsel for the State that the
only questions now reviewable are the validity of the statute which compelled the State Highway Commission to
impose upon the Railway one-half of the cost; and" the

Nor is it necessary to consider the contentions of the
Railway that the state action here challenged, taken in
conjunction with the burdens of taxation and systems of
regulation to which the railroads and their competitors
are subject, amounts to a denial of equal protection of the
laws; and that it discriminates against, and imposes a
burden upon, interstate commerce.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is
reversed and the cause is remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE and MR. JUsTICE CARDOZO are of the
opinion that there is nothing in the evidence or special
facts relied on by the appellant to sustain a finding of
arbitrary action by the State. of Tennessee or its official
representatives; that on the contrary the separation of
grades is conceded to be necessary to give protection to
travelers against perils created by the railroad; that a
decision correct in result may not properly be reversed
because the reasoning of the opinion is inadequate or
erroneous; and that upon the facts stated in the record as
well as upon any others within the range of judicial notice
the appellant has failed to sustain the burden of establishing a violation of its constitutional immunities, and
the decree should be affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

took no part in the consid-

eration or decision of this case.
