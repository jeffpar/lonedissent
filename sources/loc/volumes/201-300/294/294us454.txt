HILDEGARD SCHOENAMSGRUBER v. HAMBURG
AMERICAN LINE.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH

CIRCUIT.

No. 424. Argued February 8, 1935.-Decided March 4, 1935.
1. In a proceeding in admiralty based upon a contract containing
a provision for the arbitration of claims arising out of a breach,
an order of the District Court, pursuant to the U. S. Arbitration
Act, directing the parties to proceed to arbitration, staying the
trial of the action pending the filing of the award, and retaining
jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award, is interlocutory
and not appealable. P. 456.
2. The order is not an interlocutory injunction within the meaning
of § 129 of the Judicial Code, allowing appeals from interlocutory
orders in certain proceedings. P. 456.
1 This disposition of the case finds precedent in a large number of
decisions of this court, among which the following are cited as exarmiples: Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co., 111 U. S. 358, 372;

Opinion of the Court.

3. Section 129 of the Judicial Code applies only to suits in equity,
except as otherwise specified therein; appeals from interlocutory
decrees in admiralty are limited to such only as determine the
rights and liabilities of the parties. Jud. Code, § 129, as amended
by Act of April 3, 1926. P. 457.

CERTIoRAi, 293 U. S. 547, to review a decree dismissing

appeals from an order of the District Court for arbitration in a proceeding in admiralty.
Mr. Harry H. Semmes submitted for petitioners.
Mr. Joseph C. Sharp, with whom Messrs. J. Hampton
Hoge and S. Hasket Derby were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner in No. 424 is the minor daughter of peti-

tioner in No. 425. Each filed a libel in admiralty in the
district court for northern California against respondents
claiming damages on account of personal injuries alleged
to have been inflicted upon the child while she was a
passenger on the Oakland. The libels assert that the
wrongful act constituted a breach of respondents' contract
to carry the child safely from Hamburg, Germany, to San
Francisco. The answers, in addition to denying material
allegations of the libels, allege that the contract contained
the following provision: "Complaints based on failure
to fulfill the terms of this contract, claims for damages,
etc., on the part of the passenger must be filed with the
representative (agent) of the Hamburg-American Line
at the port of destination immediately after the arrival
of the ship. In the event that an agreement cannot be
reached, both parties agree to refer the matter to the
German Consul at the port of destination whose decision
will be acceptable, to both parties, subject to the laws
applicable thereto."

Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

Respondents applied to the court for arbitration under
the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C., §§ 1-15.
Opposing the application, petitioners maintained that the
child was carried as a passenger, not in pursuance of the
contract alleged in the answers, but upon one that contained no provision for arbitration. After hearing and
upon consideration of the evidence, the court' ordered the
parties to proceed to arbitration, stayed trial of the action
pending the filing of the award, and retained jurisdiction
to make orders and enter decrees contemplated by the Act
or otherwise permitted or required by law. 9 U. S. C., §8.
Petitioners appealed; the Circuit Court of Appeals held
the orders to be interlocutory and nonappealable and
dismissed the appeals. 70 F. (2d) 234.
Claiming that decision to be in conflict with Krauss
Bros. Lumber Co. v. Louis Bossert & Sons (C. C. A.-2), 62

F. (2d) 1004, and that the orders are final, petitioners applied for, and this court granted, writs of certiorari. Later,
but before argument of these cases, we announced decisions in Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., 293 U. S.
379, and Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester

Service Corp., 293 U. S. 449, which definitely show that
the orders are not final and therefore not appealable under
§ 128, Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C., § 225.
Abandoning their claims that the orders are final, petitioners by supplemental brief argue that they are appealable under § 129, 28 U. S. C., § 227. They rely on the
Shanferoke case. That decision was based on the Enelow

case. Each of these was an action at law in which the
defendant by answer sought equitable relief. In each the
order held appealable stayed proceedings on the law side
and operated as an'injunction, within the meaning of that
section, against proceedings in another court. The cases
now before us are in admiralty. The orders appealed from
merely stay action in the court pending arbitration and
filing of the award. As shown by the Enelow Case, they
are not interlocutory injunctions within the meaning of
§ 129. And plainly, so far as concerns appealability, they
are not to be distinguished from an order postponing trial
of an action at law to await the report of an auditor.
Save as therein otherwise specified, § 129 extends only
to suits in equity. Its provisions relating to injunctions
and receivers were put in present form by the Act of
February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 937. Before that Act, appealability was expressly confined to suits " inequity." 2 Its
legislative history shows the omission of the phrase was
not intended to remove that limitation.8 While courts of
admiralty have capacity to apply equitable principles in
order the better to attain justice, they do not have general
equitable jurisdiction and, except in limitation of lia§ 7, Act of March 3, 1891 2OStat. 828, as amended February 18,

bility proceedings,5 they do not issue injunctions.' The
Act of April 3, 1926, 44 Stat. 233, added to § 129 a provision granting appeal "from an iriterlocutory decree in
admiralty determining the rights and liabilities of the
parties." This specification, taken in connection. with the
other parts of the section, indicates that Congress did not
intend to make appealable any other interlocutory decrees
in admiralty. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that
Congress intended to allow repeated appeals in the class
of cases to which these belong. That would be contrary
to its long-established policy. The orders under-consideration may be reviewed on appeal from the final decrees, § 128, Judicial Code. Petitioners' contention that
'they are interlocutory injunctions under § 129 is without
merit.
