CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA.

No. 361.

Argued January 11, 1935.-Decided February 4, 1935.

1. Every State has jurisdiction to determine for itself the liability of
property within its territorial limits to seizure and sale under the
process of its courts. P. 213.
2. A State may provide that the local assets of foreign and domestic
corporations shall remain subject to be attached by creditors after
the corporations have become insolvent and have been dissolved.
P. 213.
3. This policy does not offend the full faith and credit clause of the
Constitution though it permit local creditors to secure and enforce
liens on the local assets of a foreign corporation after the laws of
its home State have dissolved it and transferred all of its property
to a statutory liquidator for the purpose of making equal distribution among all of its creditors. Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S.
243, distinguished. Pp. 214-215.
4. A point not made in the court below nor in the petition for certiorari will not be considered as a ground for reversal. P. 216.

MR. JUSTICE

CARDOZo delivered the opinion of the

Court.
What is before us is another chapter of a controversy
that was here at the last term. Clark v. Williard, 292
U. S. 112.
The controversy is the outcome of conflicting claims to
the Montana assets of an Iowa corporation. On the
one side is the petitioner, the Insurance Commissioner of
Iowa, claiming as official liquidator. On the other side
are the respondents, judgment creditors of the corporation, armed with an execution which they insist upon
the right to levy. If the petitioner prevails, there is equal.
distribution; if the respondents prevail, the race is to
the swift.
When the case was here before, the Supreme Court of
Montana had given priority to the judgment creditors,
placing its ruling upon the ground that the petitioner,
the foreign liquidator, was not a successor to the corporation, but a chancery receiver, with a title, if any, created
by the Iowa decree. 94 Mont. 508; 23 P. (2d) 959.
We held that under the statutes of Iowa the liquidator
was the successor to the corporation, and not a mere
custodian, and that in ruling to the contrary the Supreme
Court of Montana had denied full faith and credit to the
statutes of a sister state. 292 U. S. 112, 121. The question was then an open one whether there was any local
policy, expressed in statute or decision, whereby the title
of a statutory successor was to be subordinated to later
executions at the suit of local creditors. As to that question the Supreme Court of Montana would speak the final
word. 292 U. S. 112, 123. The decree was accordingly

CLARK v. WILLIARD.
211

Opinion of the Court.

vacated and the cause remitted to the state court to
the end that the local policy might be made known
through the one voice that could declare it with ultimate
authority.
The Supreme Court of Montana has reconsidered the
conflicting claims of liquidator and creditors in the light
of that decision. It has held (the Chief Justice and an
Associate Justice dissenting) that the local policy of the
state permits attachments and executions against insolvent corporations, foreign and domestic; that the writs
will not be halted though the effect of the levy may be
waste or inequality; and that this rule will prevail
against' a statutory successor, clothed with title to the
assets, just as much as against the corporation itself or
the trustees upon dissolution or a chancery receiver.
Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 97 Mont. 503; 34 P. (2d)
982. A writ of certiorari brings the case to us again.
Every state has jurisdiction to determine for itself ,the
liability of property within its territorial limits to seizure
and sale under the process of its courts. Green v. Van
Buskirk, 5 Wall. 307, 312; 7 Wall. 139; Hervey v. Rhode
Island Locomotive Works, 93 U. S. 664, 671; Security
Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., 173 U. S. 624, 628.
Montana does not challenge the standing of this foreign
liquidator as successor to the dissolved corporation or as
owner of its assets. On the contrary his standing and
ownership are now explicitly conceded. All that Montana
does by the decree under review is to impose upon such
ownership the lien of judgments and executions in conformity with local law. In this there is no denial to the
statutes of Iowa or to its judicial proceedings of the faith
and credit owing to them under the Constitution of the
United States. United States Constitution, Article IV,
ยง 1.
If the corporation were still in being, and still the
owner of the assets, its ownership would be subordinate

Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

to the process of the local courts. So much would be conceded everywhere. If title had been conveyed to an assignee for the benefit of creditors by a common law
assignment or by insolvency proceedings, claimants in
Montana might pursue their suits and remedies in derogation of the assignment when the law or policy of the
locality ordained that this result should follow. So much,
again, is settled by unimpeachable authority. Security
Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., supra; Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, 208 U. S. 570, 579, 580; Cole v. Cunningham, 133 U. S. 107; Oakey v. Bennett, 11 How. 33,
44; Ockerman v. Cross, 54 N. Y. 29; Warner v. Jaffray,
96 N. Y. 248, 255; Barth v. Backus, 140 N. Y. 230; 35
N. E. 425; Ward v. Connecticut Pipe Mfg. Co., 71 Conn.
345; 41 Atl. 1057; Gilbert v. Hewetson, 79 Minn. 326;
82 N. W. 655. The principle of these decisions applies
with undiminished force to a statutory successor. In
respect of his subjection to the power of the local law, his
position is no better than that of the dissolved corporation
to whose title he has succeeded or of its voluntary assignee
upon a trust for all the creditors. He must submit, as
must they, to the mandate of the sovereignty that has
the physical control of what he would reduce to his possession. Cf. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra;
City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Schnader, 293 U. S. 112;
Cooper v. PhiladelphiaWorsted Co., 68 N. J. Eq. 622, at
p. 629; 60 Atl. 352.
This is not to say that any uniform policy prevails
among the states when liquidators and creditors thus compete with one another. The diversity of practice was
pointed out, with citation of the precedents, v hen the
case was here before. 292 U. S. 112, at p. 122. Some
states prefer a rule of equal distribution and compel the
local suitor to yield to the statutory successor (Martyne
v. American Union Fire Ins. Co., 216 N. Y. 183; 110 N. E.
502), though at times with precautionary conditions.

CLARK v. WILLIARD.

Opinion of the Court.

292 U. S. 112, at p. 129; People v. Granite State Provident
Association, 161 N. Y. 492; 55 N. E. 1053. Other states
give the local creditor a free hand, with the result that he
may seize what he can find, though the assets of the
debtor are dismembered in the process. Lackmann v.
Supreme Council, 142 Cal. 22; 75 Pac. 583; Shloss v.
Metropolitan Surety Co., 149 Ia. 382; 128 N. W. 384;
Zacher v. Fidelity Trust Co., 109 Ky. 441; 59 S. W. 493.
Choice is uncontrolled; as between one policy and the
other, so far as the Constitution of the Nation has any
voice upon the subject. Iowa may say that one who is a
liquidator with title, appointed by her statutes, shall be so
recognized in Montana with whatever rights and privileges accompany such recognition according to Montana
law. For failure to give adherence to that principle we
reversed and remanded when the case was last before us.
Iowa may pot say, however, that a liquidator with title
who goes into Montana may set at naught Montana law
as to the distribution of Montana assets, and carry over
into another state the rule of distribution prescribed by
the statutes of the domicile.
Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, holds nothing to
the contrary. A statutory liquidator of a Minnesota corporation brought suit in Wisconsin against defendants
there residing to enforce their personal liability as stockholders in accordance with a Minnesota statute. The
only question was whether the liquidator so appointed had
capacity to sue. In the view of the court, capacity and
title were established by the laws of Minnesota. United
States Constitution, Article IV, ยง 1. The ruling did'not
affect the power of Wisconsin to subject the proceeds of
the cause of action or any other assets to the claims of
local creditors. Nothing in the case suggests that creditors of the Minnesota corporation were suing in Wisconsin or that there was threat of suit thereafter. The prob,
lem now here was left untouched and unconsidered.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Syllabus.

294 U. S.

The petitioner makes a point that the property or part
of it subjected to the levy was not of such a nature as to
have a situs in Montana or to be amenable to process
issuing from her courts. No such point was made in the
record of the proceedings in the court below. No such
point was made in this court in the petition for certiorari
to bring the case here for review. It will not be considered now. Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U. S. 90, 98; Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, 293 U. S. 172, 182; Helvering v. Taylor, 293 U. S. 507.
The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.
Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 338. Argued January 16, 17, 1935.-Decided February 4, 1935.
1. National banks are subject to state laws in so far as these are
consistent with the policy and provisions, express or implied, of
the National Bank Act or other federal statutes. P. 219.
2. Under ยง 2 of the Bank Collection Code, as adopted in Indiana,
the relation between a bank forwarding a check for collection and
the collecting bank is that of principal and agent, until the agent
has finished the business of collection. P. 219.
3. In the absence of tokens of a contrary intention, the better common-law doctrine is that the agency of a collecting bank is brought
to an end by the collection of the paper, the bank being from then
on in the posiion of a debtor, with liberty, like debtors generally,
to use the proceeds as its own. P. 219.
4. A collecting bank need not collect in cash if another way has the
sanction of law or custom to which the parties may be held to have
impliedly consented. P. 220.
5. Under ยง 9 of the Bank Collection Code of Indiana, a collecting
bank, as agent, is not under a duty to collect for cash but may
collect by having the collection item set off against checks owed by
itself, in a local clearing-house transaction in the customary way;
