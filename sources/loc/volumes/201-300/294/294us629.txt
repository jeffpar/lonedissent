BRODERICK, SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS OF
NEW YORK, v. ROSNER ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS OF NEW
JERSEY.

No. 528. Argued February 15, 1935.-Decided April 1, 1935.
A statute of New Jersey (Corporation Act, § 94 (b)) provides that
no proceeding may be maintained in the courts of that State to
enforce a stockholder's statutory personal liability arising under
the laws of another State, except suits in the nature of "an equitable accounting for the proportionate benefit of all parties interested, to which such corporation and its legal representatives, if
any, and all of its creditors and all of its stockholders shall be
necessary parties." The Superintendent of Banks of New York
brought an action in a New Jersey court against 557 New Jersey
stockholders of a New York bank, to recover unpaid assessments
levied upon them pursuant to the banking laws of New York.
The bank had altogether 20,843 stockholders and more than
400,000 depositors and other creditors, many of whom resided
elsewhere than in New Jersey. The court held the action barred
by the New Jersey statute; suggested that leave might be granted
to file a bill in equity pursuant thereto. Held:
1. The New Jersey statute, as here applied, effectively denies to
the Superintendent the right to resort to the courts of that State
to enforce the liability of stockholders residing there; the complaint conformed to the New Jersey practice and the action would
have been entertained but for the statute. Pp. 639, 640.
2. The nature of the cause of action brings it within the scope
of the full faith and credit clause; the subject matter is not such
as permits considerations of local policy to dominate rules of
comity. P. 643.
3. That the assessment was made under statutory direction by
-an administrative officer does not preclude the application of the
full faith and credit clause. P. 644.
4. That the administrative determination of the assessment made
in New York may be subject to collateral attack does not justify
the New Jersey court in refusing to take jurisdiction of the Superintendent's suit. P. 646.

APPEAL from a judgment affirming a judgment sustaining a motion to strike out the complaint in an action
brought in the Supreme Court of New Jersey by the Superintendent of Banks of New York to enforce an assessment levied on stockholders pursuant to the banking laws
of New York.
Messrs. Carl J. Austrian and James D. Carpenter,Jr.,
with whom Messrs. Arthur Ofner and Harold N. Cohen
were on the brief, for appellant.
Under § 80 of the New York Banking Law, as'interpreted by the New York courts, the levy of an assessment
by the Superintendent of Banks is an official or public
act, and conclusive in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or
clear error of law.
Under Art. IV, § 1, of the Federal Constitution, New
Jersey is required: (1) To permit enforcement against
stockholders of New York banks residing in New Jersey
of the assessment liability provided under Art. VIII, § 7,
of the New York Constitution and §§ 80 and 120 of the
New York Banking Law; and (2) To recognize the official
determination by the New York Superintendent of Banks
of the necessity of such assessment, made pursuant to the
provisions of § 80 of the New York Banking Law.
The requirement that the assessment may only be enforced through an accounting by a bill in equity, denies
to the determination of the Superintendent that conclusive effect which attaches to it under the laws of New
York. It amounts to a denial of the right of the Superintendent to resort to the courts 'of New Jersey in this case,

and thus violates the full faith and credit clause, and
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Mr. Walter J. Bilder, with whom Mr. Nathan Bilder
was on the brief, for Mary Rosner et al., appellees.
The full faith and credit clause does not compel a State
to open and lend its courts to the prosecution of a suit
based upon a cause of action created by the statutes of another State. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Cox, 145 U. S. 593;
Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 207 U. S. 142;
Spokane & I. E. R. Co. v. Whitley, 237 U. S. 487; Union
Trust Co. v. Grosman, 245 U. S. 412; Atchison, T. & S. F.
Ry. Co. v. Nichols, 264 U. S. 348; Bradford Electric Light
Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145; Dougherty v. American
McKenna Process Co., 255 Ill. 369.
The full faith and credit clause establishes a rule of
evidence rather than of jurisdiction. Anglo-American
Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373; Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657; Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265. The clause obviously can
require no more than this: that when a court of one State
does entertain a suit which involves a matter as to which
the rights of the parties are, on general legal principles,
governed by the statutes of another State, the court (of
the forum) shall permit those statutes to be put in evidence and shall accord to them the probative effect of
establishing those rights. This requirement, however, is
far different from a mandate to the courts of each State
in invitum to take jurisdiction of suits based upon causes
of action created by the statutes of other States. Cases
distinguished: Pulsifer v. Greene, 96 Me. 438; Royal
Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S. 531; Bradford Electric Light
Co. v. Clapper,286 U. S. 145; Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, 267 U. S. 544; Whitman v. National Bank,

,verse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243; Converse v. Aetna National Bank, 212 U. S. 565; Bernheimer v. Converse, 206
U. S. 516; Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Cox, 145 U. S. 593;
•Matin v. Augedahl, 247 U. S. 142; Kennedy v. Gibson,
8 Wall. 498. There is a fundamental difference between
the effect which the full faith and credit clause and the
related Act of Congress secure to a foreign judgment, and
the effect which they secure to a foreign statute.
The determination of the Superintendent is not conclusive under the laws of New York; but only presumptive evidence. This provision of the New York statute
is not binding upon and would not be recognized by the
courts of other States. It is a mere rule of procedure.
But even if the Superintendent's determination were
conclusive under the laws of New York, the courts of
New Jersey would be under no constitutional obligation
to give it the same conclusive effect in New Jersey; for
that determination is not a judgment or judicial proceeding (Const., Art. IV, § 1; Rev. Stats., § 905). Nor is his
determination a public act within the meaning of the full
faith and credit clause, since it is not a statute. By making no provision as to any other "public acts," Congress
evinced its own understanding that no other acts were
intended by the constitutional clause. Accord: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,286 U. S. 145.
Even if appellant were permitted by the New Jersey
law to prosecute his action in a court of law he would be
put to the same proof as he would in a court of equity in
New Jersey. Hence, appellant's complaint against, the
New Jersey statute on the score of its requiring him to
bring an equity action in the nature of an accounting
instead of an action at law is without substance. Distinguishing: Whitman v. National Bank, 176 U. S. 559;
Hancock v. Farnum, 176 U. S. 640.
The argument based on the impracticability of the
equity remedy is irrelevant to any constitutional ques-

tion in this case. The question is whether that which the
New Jersey statute prohibits is constitutional; not
whether that which it permits is legally valid or available.
Furthermore, the criticism derived from the large number
of the depositors and stockholders, does not arise from any
intrinsic fault in the New Jersey statute but from a mere
circumstance connected with the New York bank itself.
The absolute right of a stockholder to have a court pass
upon the necessity for and extent of the enforcement of
stockholders' liability in a judicial proceeding was declared
by the highest court of New York in the case of Assets
Realization Co. v. Howard, 211 N. Y. 430.
The New Jersey statute and judgment do .not deprive
the creditors of the Bank of their property without due
process of law, or violate the constitutional provision
guaranteeing privileges of citizens.
Mr. David Friedenberg, with whom Messrs. Howard
Ewart, Benjamin Gross, and James Mercer Davis were on
the brief, for Charles P. Anderson et al., appellees.
Section 94b of the New Jersey Corporation Act, and the
judgment of the court below based thereon, do not violate
the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, Art.
IV,§ 1.
The assessment by the Superintendent of Banks of New
York is not, conclusive under the law of that State.
The assessment is not a public act within the meaning
of the constitutional provision. Crippin, Lawrence &
Co. v. Laighton, 69 N. H. 540. Concededly, the Constitution and banking laws of New York upon which appellant founds his alleged cause of action are public acts
within the meaning of the constitutional provision.
Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,286 U. S. 145, 154.
155.
The assessment is not a judicial proceeding within the
full faith and credit clause.
The National banking assessment cases are not in point.

Argument for Appellees.

294 U. S.

The full faith and credit clause does not require a State
to provide a court and method of enforcement of judgments of sister States. Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance
Co., 127 U. S. 265; Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14;
Alabama State Bank v. Dalton, 9 How. 522.
The full faith and credit clause is not jurisdictional, but
merely provides a rule of evidence. McElmoyle v. Cohen,
13 Pet. 312; Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S.
265, 292; Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373; Clifford v. Williams, 131 Fed.
100; Israel v. Israel, 130 Fed. 237. And one very important and logical result of this statement is that a State
need not provide a court within which, and a procedure by
which, the judgment of a sister State may be sued upon.
Anglo-American Provision Co. case, supra. See also:
Weidman v. Weidman, 274 Mass. 118.
Section 94b of the New Jersey Corporation Act plainly
intends that the law courts of New Jersey should not have
jurisdiction over suits to enforce the statutory liability
of stockholders of foreign corporations, and that the
Court of Chancery of New Jersey should have sole jurisdiction to entertain such suits. The statute is thus in
the same category as the section of the New York Code
of Civil Procedure referred to in the Anglo-American Provision Company case, supra.
It is respectfully submitted that, under the authority
of the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis
Provision Co., supra, a State could constitutionally pass
an act, the effect of which would be that the State did
not provide any means of enforcing a judgment of a sister
State; and if it provided a certain remedy for enforcing
such judgment, whether the same were a reasonable
remedy or otherwise, it could not be compelled to afford
a different procedure.

verse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243; Selig v. Hamilton, 234
U. S. 652; and Matin v. Augedahl, 247 U. S. 142. In
none of them was there involved a statute passed by the
legislature of the forum in which the plaintiff chose to
bring his suit to enforce the stockholder's liability to assessment, which deprived the courts of that State of jurisdiction to determine a suit of that nature. The only point
made therein was that a court of one State, having general jurisdiction, could not on the ground of policy or in
its discretion refuse to enforce the judgment or give
effect to the judicial proceedings of a sister State.
The State of New Jersey is not required by the full
faith and credit clause to enforce in its courts the cause
of action created by the New York Constitution and banking laws in favor of appellant, whether the liability of the
shareholders thereunder be deemed contractual or otherwise. Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265.
The decisions of this Court involving the Minnesota
laws were based upon the existence of judicial proceedings
in that State.
The public acts, i. e., statutes, of one State are not required by the full faith and credit clause to be given in
every other State the same effect as they have in the State
of their enactment.
Causes of action created by the laws of a State' are enforced in a sister State only by comity. Bank of Augusta
v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519; Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224
N. Y. 99; Stewart v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 168 U. S.
445; Brown v. Perry, 104 Vt. 66; Texas & PacificR. Co. v.

by the laws of a sister State. Chambers v. Baltimore &
Ohio R. Co., 207 U. S. 142; Dougherty v. McKenna Process Co., 255 Ill. 369; Spokane & I. E. R. Co. v. Whitley,
237 U. S. 487; BradfordElectric Light Co. v. Clapper, 286
U. S. 145, 160; Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S.
397, 409.
The refusal of New Jersey to extend its comity so as to
enforce appellant's alleged cause of action in its Supreme
Court does not raise a federal question, and, therefore,
is not reviewable by ,this Court.
Section 94b of the New Jersey Corporation Act does not
violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The judgment below was properly entered, and the
propriety of such entry is not reviewable by this Court.
Appellant, as Superintendent of Banks of New York,
is without right or authority to maintain the alleged cause
of action in New Jersey.
Mr. J. H. Harrisonsubmitted for The Bobdon Co. et al.,
appellees.
The Superintendent of Banks of New York is a mere
statutory receiver, does not have title to the assets of the
bank, and has not, as of right, any standing in courts outside of the State of New York. Matter of Union Bank,
204 N. Y. 313; Yokohama Specie Bank v. Chinese Merchants Bank, 219 App. Div. 256.
The Superintendent may obtain access to the courts of
New Jersey only through the exercise of comity.
The courts of law of New Jersey are not the proper
forum for the enforcement of this assessment.
Section 94b of the Corporation Act of New Jersey does
not violate the Constitution of the United States *or
Amendments thereof. Western National Bank v. Reckless, 96 Fed. 70; Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22.
It has generally been held by the courts that the full
faith and credit clause is not jurisdictional but merely

provides a rule of evidence. Anglo-American Provision
Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373; Clifford v.
Williams, 131 Fed. 100; Israel v. Israel, 130 Fed. 237.
It is important to note that in this case there has been
no judicial proceeding of any kind in the State of New
York by virtue of which the relation between the Superintendent of Banks and the Bank of the United States was
fixed. See McKnett v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., 292 U. S.
230.
It would be most unreasonable and unjust for this Court
to hold that a State is compelled by the full faith and
credit clause of the Constitution to give effect to the ex
parte determination of an administrative officer of another
State.
Section 94b is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The entry of a judgment, final in form, by the New Jersey Supreme Court was proper.
By leave of Court, Mr. John TV. Bricker, Attorney General of Ohio, and Messrs. TV. Dale Dunifon and J.
Roth Crabbe filed a brief on behalf of Mr. Samuel H.
Squire, Superintendent of Banks of Ohio, as amicus curiae,
supporting the contention of appellant that § 94b of the
New Jersey Corporation Act is unconstitutional.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIs

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Pursuant to Article VIII, § 7, of the Constitution of

New York, its Banking Law (Consolidated Laws, Chapter
Two) provides, § 120:
"The stockholders of every bank will be individually

responsible, equally and ratably and not one for another,
for all contracts, debts and engagements of the bank, to
the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the

par value thereof, in addition to the amount invest d ix
such shares."

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

The Bank of the United States is a corporation organized under the Banking Law of New York and had its
places of business in New York City. Its outstanding
capital stock is $25,250,000 represented by 1,010,000 shares
of $25 par value. On November 17, 1933, Joseph A.
Broderick, as Superintendent of Banks of the State of
New York, brought, in the Supreme Court of New Jersey,
this action against 557 of its stockholders who are residents of New Jersey, to recover unpaid assessments levied
by him upon them pursuant to law.
The defendant moved to strike out the complaint on
the ground, among others, that, by reason of § 94 (b) of
the Corporation Act of New Jersey (2 Comp. Stats. p.
1656), it failed to set out a cause of action enforceable in
any court of that State. The section, first enacted March
30, 1897, provides:
"No action or proceeding shall be maintained in any
court of law in this state against any stockholder, officer
or director of any domestic or foreign corporation by or
on behalf of any creditor of such corporation to enforce
any statutory personal liability of such stockholder, officer
or director for or upon any debt, default or obligation of
such corporation, whether such statutory personal liability
be deemed penal or contractual, if such statutory personal
liability be created by or arise from the statutes or laws
of any other state or foreign country, and no pending or
futuie action or proceeding to enforce such statutory personal liability shall be maintained in any court of this
state other than in the nature of an equitable accounting
for the proportionate benefit of all parties interested, to
which such corporation and its legal representatives, if
any, and all of its creditors and all of its stockholders
shall be necessary parties."
Broderick seasonably claimed that to sustain the asserted bar of the statute would violate Article IV, § I, of
the Federal Constitution which provides that: "Full

BRODERICK v. ROSNER.
629

Opinion of the Court.

faith and credit shallbe given in each State to the public
acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other
State"; and the legislation of Congress enacted pursuant
thereto. The trial court sustained the motion to strike
out the complaint, Broderick v. Abrams, 112 N. J. L. 309;
170 Atl. 214, on the ground that the statute of the State
constituted a bar to the action. Judgment against the
plaintiff with costs, was entered in favor of each of the
defendants, and the judgment was affirmed by the Court
of Errors and Appeals "for the reasons expressed in the
opinion " of the trial court, 113 N. J. L. 305; 174 Atl. 507.
An appeal to this Court was allowed.
Fiist. The conditions imposed by § 94 (b) of the New
Jersey statute upon the bringing of suits to enforce such
assessments, as here applied, deny to the Superintendent
the right to resort to the courts of the State to enforce
the assessment of liability upon the stockholders there
resident. The requirement that the proceeding be by
bill in equity, instead of by an action at law, would, if
standing alone, be no obstacle. But by withholding
jurisdiction unless the proceeding be a suit for an equitable accounting to which the "corporation and its legal
representatives, if any, and all of its creditors and all of
its stockholders shall be necessary parties," it imposes a
condition which, as here applied, is legally impossible of
fulfillment. For it is not denied that according to the
decisions of the New Jersey courts "necessary parties"
means those whose presence in a suit is essential as a
jurisdictional prerequisite to the entry of judgment, so
that no decree can be made respecting the subject matter
of litigation until they are before the court, Wilkinson
v. Dodd, 40 N. J. Eq. 123, 130; 3 Atl. 360; In re Martin,
86 N. J. Eq. 265; 98 Atl. 510; McBride v. Garland, 89
N. J. Eq. 314; 104 AtI. 435; and that to secure jurisdiction personally over those who are not residents of New
Jersey, or engaged in business there, is impossible. Pen-

Car Co., 65 N. J. Eq. 730; 55 Atl. 997; Papp v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 113 N. J. Eq. 522, 530; 167 Atl. 873.
The corporation has no place of business in New Jersey;
only a few of the many stockholders and creditors have
either residence or place of business there.
Moreover, even if it were legally possible to satisfy the
statutory condition by making substituted service by publication upon non-resident stockholders and creditors,
compare Kirkpatrick v. Post, 53 N. J. Eq. 591, 594; 32
Atl. 267; 53 N. J. Eq. at 641; 33 Atl. 1059, the cost would
be prohibitive. The number of the stockholders is 20,843; the number of depositors and other creditors exceeds
400,000; and the amounts assessed against the individual
defendants are relatively small-against some only $50.
The aggregate of sheriff's fees alone as to the non-resident
defendants, aside from expenses of publication and mailing, would exceed the aggregate amount due from the
New Jersey stockholders.1 The suggestion, in the opinion
of the Supreme Court, that leave might be granted to file
a bill in equity is, therefore, without legal significance.
Second. But for the statute, the action would have
been entertained. Compare Young v. Masci, 289 U. S.
' It is stated by counsel, without contradiction, that, under the New
Jersey practice, before substituted service can ever be made, the
sheriff must have made as to each non-resident defendant a return
non est inventus. New Jersey Public Laws, 1922, c. 88, entitles the

sheriff to a fee of $1.50 for making an affidavit of non-residence as
to each defendant. After such affidavit the plaintiff, it is said, would
be required to make applications for leave to effect substituted service on each of the absent defendants and to present the essential facts
showing the necessity therefor, setting forth the residence and place
of business of each. Besides notice sent to each, it would be necessary
to publish the notice once a week during four consecutive weeks in
some newspaper. N. J. P. L. 1912, c. 155, § 13; N. J. Chancery Rules,
36-38. It is estimated that the 420,000 names of non-resident defendants would fill at least 80 newspaper pages of 8 columns each.

BRODERICK v. ROSNER.
629

Opinion of the Court.

253. New Jersey has provided courts with jurisdiction
of suits of like nature and procedure otherwise appropriate for their determination. McDermott v. Woodhouse,
87 N. J. Eq. 615, 620; 101 Atl. 375; Graham v. Fleissner,
107 N. J. L. 278; 153 Atl. 526; Western Nat. Bank v.
Reckless, 96 Fed. 70. Compare Cochrane v. Morris, 10
N. J.Misc. 82; 157 Atl. 652. The plaintiff is not, as in
Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, a foreign receiver. He sues
as an independent executive in whom has been vested by
statute the cause of action sued on, Converse v. Hamilton,
224 U. S. 243, 257. The complaint is in conformity to the
state practice, see 112 N. J. L. 309, 310; 170 Atl. 214;
Beatty v. Lincoln Bus Co., 11 N. J. Misc. 938; 169 Atl. 286;
and it sets forth the facts essential to a recovery against the
stockholder under the law of New York. It shows that
the requirements of a valid assessment and of the right
to enforce the same by action at law have been complied with, alleging, among other things: that, on December 11, 1930, Broderick, pursuant to § 57 of the New York
Banking Law, took possession of the Bank's business and
property; that since May 6, 1931, he has been engaged
in liquidating the same; that prior to July 1, 1932, he
determined, pursuant to §§ 80 and 120, that the reasonable value of the assets of the Bank was not sufficient to
pay the creditors in full and that there was due them
$30,000,000 in excess of such reasonable value; that the
deficiency then fixed and determined has continued ever
since; that upon the Superintendent of Banks is imposed
the duty of making assessment upon the stockholders and
enforcing the liability of stockholders for the benefit of
the creditors and that actions to enforce the liability are
to be brought in the name of the Superintendent; 2 that
'Section 80 of the New York Banking Law provides: "In case
any such stockholder shall fail or neglect to pay such assessment
within the time fixed in said notice, the superintendent shall have a
cause of action, in his own name as superintendent of banks, against

294 U. S.

prior to July 1, 1932, he determined that an assessmen't
of $25 against each stockholder for each share of stock
held by him was required for the payment of the Bank's
indebtedness; that he duly made upon each stockholder a
demand for the payment thereof on August 8, 1932; and
that among the stockholders upon whom such demand
was made and who failed to pay are the several defendants.
Third. The power of a State to determine the limits
of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the
controversies which shall be heard therein is subject to
the limitations imposed by the Federal Constitution.
McKnett v. St. Louis & San Francisco Ry., 292 U. S.
230, 233. A "State cannot escape its constitutional obligations [under the full faith and credit clause] by the
simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to
courts otherwise competent." Kenney v. Supreme Lodge,
252 U. S.411, 415.3 It is true that a State can legislate
only with reference to its own jurisdiction, Bonaparte v.
Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S.
386; and that the full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right which has ripened
into a judgment of another State or has been conferred by
its statutes. See Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,
286 U. S. 145, 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. IndustrialAccident Comm'n, ante, p. 532, at p. 546. But the
room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow
one. One State need not enforce the penal laws of an,other. Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S.657. A State may
such stockholder either severally or jointly with other stockholders of

such corporation, for the amount of such unpaid assessment or assessments, together with interest thereon from the date when such assessment was, by the terms of said notice, due and payable."
'Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 207 U. S. 142, is not to the
contrary; thexe 7joclaim was made under the full faith and credit
clause.

adopt such system of courts and form of remedy as it sees
fit. It may in appropriate cases apply the doctrine of
forum non conveniens. Anglo-American Provision Co. v.
Davis Provision Co., No. 1, 191 U. S. 373. But it may not,
under the guise of merely affecting the remedy, deny the.
enforcement of claims otherwise within the protection
of the full faith and credit clause, when its courts have
general jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties.
Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 300. Compare Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. v. Sowers, 213 U. S. 55; Tennessee
Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. v. George, 233 U. S.354. For
the States of the Union, the constitutional limitation imposed by the full faith and credit clause abolished, in large
measure, the general principle of international law by
which local policy is permitted to dominate rules of
comity.
Here the nature of the cause of action brings it within
the scope of the full faith and credit clause. The statutory
liability sought to be enforced is contractual in character.
The assessment is an incident of the incorporation. Thus
the subject matter is peculiarly within the regulatory
power of New York, as the State of incorporation. "So
much so," as was said in Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S.
243, 260, "that no other State properly can be said to
have any public policy thereon. And what the law of
Wisconsin [New Jersey] may be respecting the relative
rights and obligations of creditors and stockholders of
corporations of its creation, and the mode and means
of enforcing them, is apart from the question under consideration." Compare Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S.
516, 532. In respect to the determination of liability for
an assessment, the New Jersey stockholders submitted
themselves to the jurisdiction of New York. For "the
act of becoming a member [of a corporation] is something
more than a contract, it is entering into a complex and
abiding relation, and as marriage looks to domicil, mem-

bership looks to and must be governed by the law of
the State granting the incorporation." Modern Woodmen of America v. Miier, 267 U. S. 544, 551. Compare
Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S.531; Hancock National
Bank v. Farnum,176 U. S.640; McDermott v. Woodhouse,
87 N. J. Eq. 615, 618, 619; 101 Atl. 375.4 Obviously, recognition could not be accorded to a local policy of New
Jersey, if there really were one, of enabling all residents
of the State to escape from the performance of a voluntarily assumed statutory obligation, consistent with morality, to contribute to the payment of the depositors of
a bank of another State of which they were stockholders.
. Fourth. The fact that the assessment here in question
was made under statutory direction by an administrative
officer does not preclude the application of the full faith
and credit clause. If the assessment had been made in a
liquidation proceeding conducted by a court, New Jersey
would have been obliged to enforce it, although the
stockholders sued had not been made parties to the proceedings, and, being nonresidents, could not have been
personally served with process. Converse v. Hamilton,
224 U. S. 243, 252, 260. The reason why in that case the
full faith and credit clause was held to require Wisconsin
courts to enforce the assessment made in Minnesota was
not because the determination was embodied in a judgment. Against the nonresident stockholders there had
been no judgment in Minnesota. Wisconsin was required
to enforce the Minnesota assessment because statutes are
"public acts" within the meaning of the clause, Bradford

and because the residents of Wisconsin had, by becoming
stockholders of a Minnesota corporation, submitted themselves to that extent, to the jurisdiction and laws of the
latter State. Where a State has had jurisdiction of the
subject matter and the parties, obligations validly imposed
upon them by statute must, within the limitations above
stated, be given full faith and credit by all the other
States.
The Superintendent is an independent executive on
whom the legislature has conferred large responsibilities,
compare Isaac v. Marcus, 258 N. Y. 257, 263-5; 179 N. E.
487; Matter of Broderick, 235 App. Div. 281; 257 N. Y. S.
382; among them, the determination of the questions involved in stockholders' liability. He must decide whether
there is a deficiency of assets which requires resort to that
liability; and if so, what proportion of the full liability it
is necessary to enforce; and when the assessments shall
be paid. It is urged that unlike the assessment involved
in Converse v. Hamilton, supra, that laid by the New
York Superintendent is not conclusive as to its propriety
and amount. The contention rests primarily upon a misconception of a provision in § 80 of the Banking Law, to
the effect that "the written statement of the superintendent, under his hand and seal of office, reciting his
determination to enforce the individual liability or any
part thereof, of such stockholders, and setting forth the
value of the assets of such corporation and the liabilities
theroof, as determined by him after examination and
investigation, shall be presumptive evidence of such facts
as therein stated." This provision does not declare, as a
rule of substantive law, that the determination is open to
attack in an action to enforce the stockholders' liability.
It merely provides, as in the case of other official acts,
a method of proof without the calling of witnesses. Thus
it prescribes a rule of evidence; and may possibly affect

the manner of pleading.' But with such matters we have
here no concern. It is enough, for present purposes, that
a complaint alleging the stock ownership of the defendants, the assessment, the demand, and failure to pay, together with the determination of the value of assets and
liabilities, referred to in § 80, sets forth a good cause of
action.' Broderick v. Aaron, 147 Misc. 854; 264 N. Y. S.
15; Broderick v. Betco Corp., 149 Misc. 245; 267 N. Y. S.
139; Broderick v. American General Corp., 71 F. (2d)
864; compare Broderick v. Stephano, 314 Pa. 408; 171 AtI.
582; Broderick v. McGuire, 119 Conn. 83; 174 Atl. 314.
Even if the administrative determination of the assessment made in New York is subject to attack in a suit
brought there or in any other State, that fact would not
justify New Jersey in denying to the Superintendent the
right to bring this suit.
Fifth. The Superintendent contends that his assessment is a "public act " within the meaning of the full
faith and credit clause, and is entitled to receive in every
other State of the Union, the same recognition accorded
to it by the laws of New York. He insists that, while
under the law of New York defenses personal to individual stockholders are open to them whenever and whereever sued, Selig v. Hamilton, 234 U. S. 652, 662-3, his
determinations as to the propriety and amount of the
assessment, in so far as they involve merely the exercise
of judgment, are conclusive; and are not subject to review
by any court, except on grounds for which equity com'Compare Broderick v. McGuire, 119 Conn. 83, 101-103; 174
Atl. 314.
' Before the adoption of § 80 by the Laws of 1914, c. 369, the Superintendent was required to allege and prove the facts necessitating the
assessment. Cheney v. Scharmann, 145 App. Div. 456; 129 N. Y. S.
993; see Matter of Empire City Bank, 18 N. Y. 199, 211-213. By

monly affords relief against administrative orders. He
argues that his powers and duties in respect to the assessment of stockholders, and the proceeding to enforce liability therefor, are substantially the same as those imposed by the National Banking Act on the Comptroller
of the Currency, Van Tuyl v. Scharmann, 208 N. Y. 53,
63; 101 N. E. 881; Matter of Union Bank of Brooklyn, 176
App. Div. 477, 485; 163 N. Y. S, 485; Broderick v. Aaron,
151 Misc. 516, 523; 272 N. Y. S. 219; and that, as to
these, it has been settled by an unbroken line of authorities beginning with Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 505,
that the Comptroller's determination is conclusive in an
action at law to enforce the stockholders' liability; being
subject, like other administrative orders, only to a direct
attack for fraud or error of law by appropriate proceedings
in equity.' United States v. Knox, 102 U. S. 422, 425.
Whether this contention is sound, we have no occasion to
consider now. See Broderick v. Adamson, 148 Misc. 353,
369-371; 265 N. Y. S. 804. It is sufficient to decide that,
since the New Jersey courts possess general jurisdiction
of the subject matter and the parties, and the subject
matter is not one as to which the alleged public policy of
New Jersey could be controlling, the full faith and credit
clause requires that this suit be entertained.
