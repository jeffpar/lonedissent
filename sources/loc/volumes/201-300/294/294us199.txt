had authority to proceed with the cause for that purpose,
the supreme court of the commonwealth erred in affirming so much of the decree of the Court of Common Pleas
as directed the Insurance Commissioner to take possession of the business and property of the company, and so
far as it affirmed the order of that court which enjoined
the company from surrendering its books, records and assets to any person other than the Commissioner, and enjoined others from taking possession of them. The decree must accordingly be reversed and the cause remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, but without prejudice to an application by the Commissioner to the district court for an order relinquishing
its jurisdiction over the property of the company and vacating its injunction against surrender of it to the Commissioner for liquidation under the Insurance Department

No. 386. Argued January 15, 16, 1935.-Decided February 4, 1935.
1. The system of national bank laws extends to Puerto Rico,. ex
proprio vigore and by force of the congressional declaration

4. Revised Statutes, § 5219, as amended, U. S. C. Supp., Title 12,
§ 741, defining and limiting the permitted taxation of national
banks and their shares by States, applies to Puerto Rico. P. 205.

of a bank having its principal place of business in a State, notwithstanding that, in such case, the permission granted by it to tax
shares may not be availed of by Puerto Rico. P. 205.

7. The fact that § 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, refers to branches of national banks in dependencies or insular possessions in common with those in foreign countries, as "foreign
branches," is not indicative of an intention to subject them to
general taxation by the dependencies or possessions. P. 204.

CERTIORARI, 293 U. S. 549, to review a judgment reversing a judgment of the U. S. District Court for Puerto Rico
against the national bank in a suit to recover taxes paid
under protest to the Treasurer of Puerto Rico.
Mr. William CattronRigby, with whom Mr. Benjamin
J. Horton, Attorney General of Puerto Rico, and Mr.
Nathan R. Margold were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Earle T. Fiddler, with whom Mr. John A. Garver

was on the brief, for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. F. G. Awalt, George P.
Barse, and John F. Anderson filed a brief on behalf of
the Comptroller of the Currency, as amicus curiae.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The respondent, a national banking association whose
principal office and place of business is in New York, ap-

plied for and obtained authority to operate branches in
Puerto Rico, pursuant to § 25 of the Federal Reserve Act
as amended.' In 1932 the bank, as required by local law,
filed with the petitioner a sworn statement of assets as a
basis of assessment for taxation. By request, but under
protest, it attached a memorandum stated to be for information only, in which was set forth the amount of its total
assets, the sum of its capital, surplus, and undivided
profits, the percentage the latter was of the former, and
the value of the assets in Puerto Rico. The Treasurer
considered the same percentage of the assets in Puerto
Rico fairly represented the capital there employed. The
amount thus ascertained was $2,439,200, which he divided into three items,-real property and buildings,
$732,560; other personal property, $1,611,400; and tangible personal property, $95,240. Applying the statutory
rate to $2,439,200, he fixed the tax at $62,122.98. Upon
appeal the Board of Equalization sustained the Treasurer's action. The bank voluntarily paid $17,700.24, the
amount attributable to real property and buildings, but
paid under protest the balance of $44,422.74 demanded
in respect of the personal property, and brought suit in
the United States District Court for Puerto Rico to recover the amount. Judgment in favor of the Treasurer
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We granted
a writ of certiorari,2 because the case involves the application and scope of Acts of Congress and their effect upon
the taxing pdwer of insular possessions of the United
States."

Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

We find it unnecessary to determine whether the tax
was authorized by § 320 of the Political Code, since we
are of opinion that R. S. 5219 forbids its collection.
Taxation of a bank's branch is taxation of the bank
itself.8 The system of national banks was intended to be
co-extensive with the territorial limits of the United
States, and while the consent to taxation given by § 5219
refers in terms only to the states, it extends also to territorial governments and sets the limits of their exercise of
the power.' The form of taxation here imposed is not
permitted by the section.10 The organization of a national
bank in Puerto Rico is within the contemplation of the
National Banking Act; but if there were doubt concerning
the proposition, it finds support in legislation extending
applicable laws of the United States to lhe Island.1 Although the maintenance of branch banks is prohibited by
the National Banking Act save under narrowly limited
conditions, 2 their establishment in foreign countries, dependencies and insular possessions is authorized.". Puerto
Rico, an island possession, like a territory, is an agency
of the federal government, having no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state in virtue of which
taxes may be levied. Authority to tax must be derived

from the United States. But' like a state, though for a
different reason, such an agency may not tax a federal
instrumentality. A state, though a sovereign, is precluded from so doing because the Constitution requires
that there be no interference by a state with the powers
granted to the federal government.'4' A territory or a
possession may not do so because the dependency may
not tax its sovereign. True the Congress may consent
to such taxation; but the grant to the Island of a general
power to tax should not be construed as a consent. Nothing less than an act of Congress clearly and explicitly
conferring the privilege will suffice. Not only do we find
no such statutory consent but we are confronted by R. S.
5219, which proprio vigore extends to territories, and the
Congressional declaration that it, like other statutes of
the United States shall, if not locally inapplicable, 15 apply
to Puerto Rico.
The petitioner insists that this section is locally.inapplicable for two reasons. The first is that the section was
intended to apply only to taxation by the state, territory,
or governmental agency within whose borders the bank
has its principal place of business. The argument is that
Puerto Rico cannot avail itself of the consent to the taxing of respondent's shares, or the dividends thereon, since
the shares have no situs except New York, which is, in
contemplation of law, the association's home. The position is that the section must be available in its entirety or else wholly inapplicable. We think otherwise.
If Puerto Rico can and does collect taxes of any of the
types mentioned in R S. 5219, the mere fact that the
situation prevents resort to one of the other kinds thereby,

permitted does not make the statute a nullity in the
Island. The record discloses that there has been assessed
and collected a tax on the bank's local real estate, as permitted by paragraph 3 of R. S. 5219, and in addition an
income tax upon the local income," as permitted by paragraph 1 (c). These seem to afford appropriate and
equitable methods of taxation in respect of the association's local branches and business.
Secondly, petitioner says § 25 of the Federal Reserve Act
as amended,' exhibits an intention on the part of Congress that for purposes of taxation branches in dependencies or insular possessions shall be treated as if they
were branches established in foreign countries. The
argument is that as all are mentioned several times in
the section as "foreign branches," and since confessedlythe United States cannot limit or control the method or
manner of taxation of foreign branches, the purpose was
not to do so with respect to those in an insular possession.
We think the contention unsound. It does not follow
from the lack of power of the United States in the one
case that it did not intend to exercise its undoubted
power in the other.
We are of opinion that § 5219 prohibits the imposition
of the tax in question.'8
The judgment is
Affirmed.
