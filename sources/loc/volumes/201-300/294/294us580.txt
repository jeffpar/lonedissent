may be classification according to size and the power and

METROPOLITAN CASUALTY INSURANCE CO. v.
BROWNELL, RECEIVER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 20.

Argued October 15, 1934.-Decided March 18, 1935.

1. A discrimination in the state law between foreign and domestic
casualty insurance corporations, whereby the former are forbidden
to limit by agreement to less than three years the time within
which suit may be brought against them on their c9 ntracts,
whereas the latter are free to stipulate for any limitation that is
reasonable, is not necessarily a denial of the equal protection of
the laws but may be justified by differences between the two
classes of corporations with respect to the security and collection
of claims against them. Pp. 583-585.
2. The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute
rests on him who assails it, and courts may not declare a legislative discrimination invalid unless, in the light of facts made
known.or generally assumed, it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that the classification rests upon some
rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the
legislators. Pp. 584-586.

3. That the legislature has pursued a different policy with regard
to life insurance companies, by extending the prohibition here in
question to both foreign and domestic companies of that class,
does not, of itself, establish that the discrimination between foreign
and domestic casualty companies is arbitrary. P. 586.

ing a judgment against the casualty company in an action
against it to recover on an indemnity bond.
Mr. Alan W. Boyd, with whom Mr. James W. Noel was
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Sidney S. Miller, with whom Mr. Samuel D. Miller
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case is here on writ of certiorari, 292 U. S. 620, to
review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit, upholding an Indiana statute challenged as unconstitutional. § 9139, Burns Anno. Stat. 1926; Indiana
Acts, 1865, c. 15, § 6; § 39-1713, Burns Anno. Stat. 1933.
Respondent's predecessor in-interest brought suit in the
district court for southern Indiana to recover upon an
indemnity bond executed by petitioner. The petitioner
set up by answer and demurrer that it is a corporation organized under the laws of New York, carrying on in
Indiana the business of writing casualty insurance contracts and surety bonds; that the claim for which suit
was brought was presented to petitioner more than fifteen
months before the suit was begun; that the indemnity
bond contained a stipulation that no proceedings upon a
claim upon the bond should be brought more than fifteen
months after the date of the presentation of the claim;
and that the Indiana statute, § 9139, declaring such provision invalid,.is void because a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amend-

ment. The district court gave judgment on the pleadings
for respondent which the Court of Appeals affirmed. 68
F. (2d) 481.
The statute, construed by the Supreme Court of Indiana
in Caywood v. Supreme Lodge, 171 Ind. 410; 86 N. E. 482,
as applicable only to insurance corporations organized in
states other than Indiana, forbids them to insert in their
policies certain specified conditions, not now material, and
enacts that "any provision or condition contrary to the
provisions of this section, or any condition in said policy
inserted to avoid the provisions of this section, shall be
void, and no condition or agreement not to sue for a period
of less than three years shall be valid." There is no similar legislation applicable to domestic insurance companies
carrying on the same class of business as petitioner. They
are free to insert reasonable stipulations in their policies
for a short period of limitation, cf. Caywood v. Supreme
Lodge, supra. The statutory period of limitation for suits
to recover money on indemnity policies is ten years.
§ 2-602, Burns Anno. Stat. 1933; cf. Fidelity & Casualty
Co. v. Jasper Furniture Co., 186 Ind. 566; 117 N. E. 258.
We may assume that the petitioner, by entering the
State of Indiana and carrying on business there, is not
barred from asserting that its legislation conflicts with the
Federal Constitution, Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, 274
U. S. 490, 497, and we pass directly to the single question
presented, whether the prohibition applied here to a foreign casualty insurance company infringes the Fourteenth
Amendment because it is not likewise applied to domestic
companies. Petitioner does not assail the prohibition as
not within the scope of the legislative power or as itself
so arbitrary or unreasonable as to be a denial of due
process. It is not argued, nor could it be on the record
before us, that the restriction would be unconstitutional if
applied equally to both classes of corporations. Discrimination alone is the target of the attack.

METROPOLITAN CO. v. BROWNELL.

583

Opinion of the Court.

The equal protection clause does not prohibit legislative
classification and the imposition of statutory restraints on
one class which are not imposed on another. But this
Court has said that not every legislative discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations is permissible
merely because they differ, and that with respect to some
subjects of legislation the differences between them may
afford no reasonable basis for the imposition of a statutory
restriction upon foreign corporations, not applied to domestic corporations. The ultimate test of validity is not
whether foreign corporations differ from domestic, but
whether the differences between them are pertinent to the
subject with respect to which the classification is made.
Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, supra, 494. If those differences have any rational relationship to the legislative command, the discrimination is not forbidden. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker, Inc. v. Superior Court, 289 U. S. 361, 366;
National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U. S. 71, 75.
See Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U. S. 392, 396.
Here the classification relates to the legislative command that insurance companies shall not by agreement
limit the period within which suit may be brought on their
contracts to less than three years. The record, briefs and
arguments before us are silent as to legislation or other
local conditions in Indiana bearing on the question
whether there may be differences, in the circumstances
attending suits brought against local companies and those
brought against foreign companies, such as to justify a
difference in the applicable periods of limitation. It is
not argued that a reasonable time for bringing a suit
against domestic insurance companies of Indiana may not,
in some circumstances at least, differ from that for suing
foreign corporations. We are not told whether, in 1865
when the challenged statute was enacted, or since, differences in the legislative schemes of the state affecting the
two classes of casualty insurance companies, foreign and

584

domestic, or differences in their business practices within
the state, have or have not made more difficult and timeconsuming the collection of claims and the preparations
for litigation against foreign insurance companies than
against domestic companies. But we are asked to say a
priorn that, in the circumstances attending the two classes
of suits, there can be no differences pertinent' to the legislative command; that there can be no reasonable basis
for the legislative judgment that a different period of
limitation should be applied to the one than to the other.
It is a salutary principle of judicial decision, long emphasized and followed by this Court, that the burden of
establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on
him who assails it, and that courts may not declare a legislative discrimination invalid unless, viewed in the light
of facts made known or generally assumed, it is of such a
character as to preclude the assumption that the classification rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge
and experience of the legislators.' A statutory discrimination will not be set aside as the denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts reasonably may be
conceived to justify it. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co.,

585

Opinion of the Court.

The statutes of Indiana disclose a legislative scheme applicable to domestic casualty insurance companies differing
radically from that applied to foreign corporations, and
in some respects more exacting. Compare chapter 17 of
Title 39, Burns Anno. S tat. 1933, with other chapters of
that title. A pertinent difference which may be noted
relates to the maintenance of a fund with a public officer
for the protection of policyholders. Domestic companies
are required to maintain with the state commissioner of
insurance a guaranty fund in cash or approved securities,
Burns Anno. Stat. 1933, §§ 39-1101, 39-1105, to be augmented by the addition of five per cent. of all dividends
paid, § 39-118. These provisions appear not to be extended to foreign companies, but they, like foreign corporations writing surety bonds, are permitted to maintain a
guaranty fund of a different type with an officer of tht
state of incorporation. §§ 39-1703, 25-1401, 25-1402) 251301, 25-1304, Burns Anno. Stat. 1933.
There is no showing that the situation of foreign corporations, writing casualty insurance contracts in Indiana,
is so similar to that of domestic corporations as to preclude
any rational distinction between them as regards, the
time required for negotiating settlements of claims and
the determination whether suits .upon them should be
prosecuted within or without the state. Where the record
is silent, we cannot presume to declare that there is such
similarity, or to say that a state is prohibited from making
any distinction in the length of time within which suit
must be brought. It is not beyond the range of probability that foreign casualty companies, as distinguished
from domestic companies, generally keep their funds and
maintain their business offices, and their agencies for the
settlement of claims, outside the state. For aught that
appears such is the actual situation. See' ConcordiaFire
Ins. Co. v. Illinois,292 U. S. 535, 548. We cannot say that

these considerations may not have moved the legislature
to insist that a longer time should be given for bringing
suit against foreign companies than the latter. It was
competent for the legislature to determine whether such
differences exist, and upon the basis of those differences,
and in the exercise of a legislative judgment, to make
choice of the method of guarding against the evil aimed
at. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, 279 U. S. 582, 584;
Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., 284 U. S. 151, 158, 159. It
could likewise decide whether the differences are general
enough, as respects foreign companies, to call upon it in
the exercise of legislative judgment, not shown to be irrational, to say whether the legislative prohibition should
be applied to them as a class rather than to members of
it selected by more empirical methods. Clarke v. Deckebach, supra, 397; Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256,
259; Silver v. Silver, 280 U. S. 117, 123.
For reasons already stated the question presented here
is not affected by the fact that the indiana legislature has
pursued a different policy with respect to life insurance
companies by extending, in 1909, to both domestic and
foreign life insurance companies the prohibition applied
here. § 39-802, Burns Anno. Stat. 1933. Discriminations
between life and casualty insurance companies are not forbidden and cannot be assumed to be irrational. Considerations which may have led to the equality of treatment of
foreign and domestic life insurance companies are not disclosed. Whatever they may have been, we cannot assume
that they are equally applicable to casualty companies.

Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA.

No. 534. Argued February 15, 18, 1935.--Decided April 1, 1935.
1. Exclusion of all negroes from a grand jury by which a negro is
indicted, or from the petit jury by which he is tried for the offense,
resulting from systematic and arbitrary exclusion of negroes from
the jury lists solely because of their race or color, is a denial of the
equal protection of the laws guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth
Amendment. P. 589.
2. Whenever a conclusion of law of a state court as to a federal
right is so intermingled with findings of fact that the latter control
the former, it is incumbent upon this Court to analyze the facts
in order that the enforcement of the federal right may be assured.

3. Evidence reviewed and found to establish systematic exclusion of
negroes from jury service in two Alabama counties, solely because
of their race and color. Pp. 590, 596.
