ing it in interstate commerce. The tax, which was levied
only with respect to the gasoline consumed while the ferry boat was within the State, was held to be invalid as, in
effect, a direct tax on the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce.
But the officers of Wyoming, charged with the enforcement of the taxing statute, are giving no such application
to it as was. given, to that in Ilelson v. Kentucky, supra,
and it is not suggested that they will. All that has been
done or threatened by them, under their interpretation
of the statute, infringes no constitutional right of the complainant. In the circumstances, no. case is presented,
either by pleadings or proof, calling on a federal court of
equity to rule upon the correctness of some, other construction which may never be adopted by the state administrative officials or by the state courts.

YOUNG v. MASCI
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS OF NEW
JERSEY

No. 643.

Argued March 24, 1933.-Decided April 24, 1933

A state statute making the owner of an automobile liable for personal
injuries resulting from its negligent operation by another to whom
he has entrusted it, is consistent with due process as applied to a
non-resident owner who was not in that State when the accident
occurred and who had merely lent his machine to one not his agent
or engaged on business for him, with express or implied permission to
take it there from the State ofthe owner's. residence, where the bailment occurred and whose laws did not impose such liability. P. 256.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Argument for Appellant.

289 U.S.

Mr. Daniel Thew Wright, with whom Messrs. R.
Robinson Chance and Philip Erhhler were on the brief,
for appellant.
The law of New Jersey at once attached to the contract of bailment and protected Young from. liability for
the bailee's negligence. The drawing of the New York
statute over the state line after the contract was made
impaired the contract. Whether this was done by New
York officials or New Jersey officials or a combination of
both, is immaterial. Neither a single State, nor any coinbination of States, can wine out a constitutional right.
Young was not chargeable with knowledge of the New
York law because he was never within the jurisdiction of
New York. Even in the court in New Jersey the law of
New York had to be proved by the introduction of evidence. The loan of the automobile was a valid contract
of bailment under which Young, was protected from
liability for the negligence of Balbino by the law of the
State where the contract of bailment was made. Gavin v.
Cohen, 163 Atl. 330; New York, L. E. & TV. R. Co. v. N. J.
Electric R. Co., 60 N.J.L. 338; Doran v. Thompson, 76
N.J.L. 754; Maurer v. Brown, 106 N.J.L. 284, 285.
That the laws of a State or sovereignty have no extraterritorial operation is axiomatic. Sanford v. McDonald,
248 U.S. 185, 195; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit
Co., 213 U.S. 347-357; Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714.
It is quite true that the courts of one State will enforce
a transitory cause of action arising in another State; but
this is enforcing an existing personal right arising out of
4the lex loci; it is not giving extraterritorial operation to a
law, by applying it so as to create a cause of action in
another State. The question of the power to extend the
operation of a state statute beyond the territorial limits
of the State is directly met and disposed of in New York
Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U.S. 160.

YOUNG v. MASCI.

255

Opinion of the Court.

253

Actions in tort are in their nature transitory; in transitory actions liability may be enforced wherever the person
against whom liability exists can be found; but comity
can never impose liability upon one against whom by
the law of his situs no liability exists.
The application of the New York statute to Young in
New Jersey deprives him of liberty to make in New Jersey, the State of his domicile, and to enjoy, a contract of
bailment which is protected by the law of that State, and
under which contract the lex loci contractus protects him
from liability for the negligence of the bailee. Allgeycr
v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 589; Adair v. United States, 208
U.S. 161; Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 14; Twin City
Pipe Line Co. v. Harding Glass Co., 283 U.S. 353; Meyer
v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 399; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial
Court, 262 U.S. 522.
The extraterritorial operation given to the statute also
takes Youngs property without due process of law in violation of the Amendment under the reasoning in New
York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U.S. 160. Owing to the
fact that New York can not give its statute any extraterritorial operation, that statute, as applied in this case,
amounts to an imposition of liability which the State
was without power to impose. Frick v. Pennsylvania,
268 U.S. 473.
The State of New Jersey, through its courts, in this
case, denied appellant Young the equal protection of the
law of New Jersey guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
A New York statute provides: "Every owner of a
motor vehicle or motor cycle operated upon a public highway shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries

to person or property resulting from negligence in the
operation of such motor vehicle or motor cycle, in the
business of such owner or otherwise, by any person
legally using or operating the same with the permission,
express or implied, of such owner." Laws N.Y. 1929,
Vol. 1, p. 82; Vehicle and Traffic Law, § 59.
Masci, a citizen and resident of New York, brought this
action in a court of New Jersey against Young, a citizen
and resident of the latter State, to enforce liability under
the above statute. The case was tried before a jury. It
appeared that Young lent his automobile to Michael Balbino for a day Without restriction upon its use, the contract of bailment and delivery of the car being made in
New Jersey; that Balbino took the car to New York; and
that while driving there negligently he struck Masci.
There was evidence to justify a finding that the car was
taken to New York with Young's permission, express or
implied. Young moved for a directed verdict on the
ground that the bailment was made in New Jersey; that
he was not in New York at the time of the accident; that
Balbino was not his agent or engaged on business for him;
and that to apply the law of New York and so make the
defendant responsible for something done by Balbino in
New York would deprive the defendant of his property
and his liberty without due process of law, in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The presiding judge declined to direct the verdict; ruled that if negligence was
proved, the law of New York was controlling on the question of liability; and charged that the defendant was responsible if the operator "was driving this automobile at
the time of the accident with the permission of the defendant, either express or implied." The jury found a
verdict for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered
thereon was affirmed by the highest court of that State.
109 N.J.L. 453; 162 Atl. 623.
Young appealed to this Court on the ground, among
others, that the statute as applied violates the due process

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He does not challenge its constitutionality on the broad ground that an
owner cannot be made liable for the driver's negligence
unless the relation of master and servant exists. The
contrary had been held in New York in respect to this
statute. Downing v. New York, 219 App. Div. 444, 446;
220 N.Y.S. 76; affirmed, 245 N.Y. 597; 157 N.E. 873;
Dawley v. McKibbin, 245 N.Y. 557; 157 N.E. 856. And
in Van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U.S. 465, 467, where it was
held that the due process clause does not prevent a State
from forfeiting property of an innocent owner for the unauthorized act of one to whom he has entrusted it, the
Court states that it is not "uncommon for the law to visit
upon the owner of property the unpleasant consequences
of the unauthorized action of one to whom he has entrusted it; " and refers to the legislation of New York
"imposIng liability on owners of vehicles for the negligent operation by those entrusted with their use, regardless of a master-servant relation." Compare Pizitz Co. v.
Yeldell, 274 U.S. 112, 115-116. Statutes of like character have been sustained also by the highest courts of
other States.1
Nor does Young question the State's power to regulate
the use of motor vehicles of non-residents on its highways. Compare Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U.S. 610;
Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U.S. 160. He challenges the
'Levy v. Daniels' U-Drive Auto Renting Co., 108 Conn. 333; 143
Atl. 163; Seleine v. Wisner, 200 Iowa 1389; 206 N.W. 130; Stapleton
v. Independent Brewing Co., 198 Mich. 170; 164 N.W. 520 (compare
Hawkins v. Ermatinger, 211 Mich. 578; 179 N.W. 249); Kernan V.
11 ebb, 50 R.I. 394; 148 AtI. 186. Statutes in South Carolina and

Tennessee subject the vehicles to a lien for damages resulting from
negligent operation under certain circumstances. See Ex parte
Maryland Mctor Car Ins. Co., 117 S.Car. 100; 108 S.E. 260; ParkerHarris Co. v. Tate, 135 Tenn. 509; 188 S.W. 54. A California statute
imposes in the case of negligent operation by a minor, liability upon
the parent or guardian who has signed the minor's application for a
license. See Buelke v. Levenstadt, 190 Cal. 684; 214 Pac. 42.

Opinion of the Court.

statute only as applied to a non-resident owner who made
the bailment outside the State of New York and who was
not within it at the time of the accident.
The contention is that subjection of the owner to liability under the New York law deprives him of immunity
from liability to third parties which he 'had acquired in
New Jersey by virtue of the contract of bailment made
there; and that thus the statute deprives him of his liberty to contract and his property without due process of
law. If such a contract can be found in the case at bar,
the statute does not purport to affect it. The statute
neither forbids the making nor alters the terms of any
contract. Compare Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281
U.S. 397. It does not purport to affect rights as between
owner and bailee. Moreover, the contract of bailment
could not have conferred upon the owner immunity from
liability to third persons for the driver's negligence. Liability for a tort depends upon the law of the place of the
injury; and (apart from the effect of the full faith and
credit clause, which is not here involved) agreements
made elsewhere cannot curtail the power of a State to
impose responsibility for injuries within its borders%
Compare Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,286 U.S.
145, 154. Thus the essential question is the power of
New York to make the absent owner liable personally for
the injury infActed within the State by his machine.
When Young gave permission to drive his car to New
York, he subjected himself to the legal consequences imposed by that State upon Balbino's negligent driving as
fully as if he had stood in the relation of master to servant. A person who sets in motion in one State the
means by which injury is inflicted in another may, consistently with the due process clause, be made liable for
that injury whether the means employed be a responsible
agent or an irresponsible instrument. The cases are many

YOUNG v. MASCI.
253

Opinion of the Court.

in which'a person acting outside the State may be held
responsible according to the law of the State for injurious
consequences within it. Thus, liability is commonly imposed under such circumstances for homicide, Commonwealth v. Macloon, 101 Mass. 1; for, maintenance of a
nuisance, State v. Lord, 16 "N.H. 357, 359; for blasting
operations, Cameron v. Vandergriff, 53 Ark. 381, 386; 13
S.W. 1092; and for negligent manufacture, MacPhersonv
Buick Motor Co. 217 N.Y. 382; 111 N.E. 1050..
The power of the State to protect itself and its inhabitants is not limited by the Scope of the doctrine of principal and agent. The inadequacy of that doctrine to cope
with the menacing problem of practical responsibility for
motor accidents has been widely felt in cases where the
injurious 'consequences are the immediate result of an
intervening negligent act of another. Some courts have
held, in actions against the owner for injuries resulting
from the driver's negligence, that a presumption of the
employment relationship arises from the fact of ownership; 2 or that, if the'relationship is proved, a presumption arises that the accident occurred within the scope of
the employment.8 Many courts have extended responsibility, without the aid of legislation, by imposing liability upon the owner for injuries resulting from the negligent operation of the car by a member of his family.4

Opinion of the Court.

289 U.S.

In some States, including New York, the problem was
left to the legislature. See Van Blaricom v. Dodgson, 220
N.Y. 111, 117; 115 N.E. 443. Its statute makes mere
permission to use the car the basis of liability in case of
negligent injury. We have no occasion to decide where
the line is to be drawn generally between conduct which
may validly subject an absent party to the laws of a State
and that which may not. No good reason is suggested
why, where there is permission to take the automobile
into a State for use upon its highways, personal liability
should not be imposed upon the owner in case of injury
inflicted there by the driver's negligence, regardless of the
fact that the owner is a citizen and resident of another
State. Compare Thomas v. Matthiessen, 232 U.S. 221,
234-235.'

no denial of equal protection, since all who permit their
cars to be driven in New York are treated alike. A claim
is also made that the statute as-applied violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution, because it impairs the obligation of the contract of bailment made in
New Jersey. As it does, not appear that any claim under
