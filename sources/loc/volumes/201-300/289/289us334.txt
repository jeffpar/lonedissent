eluded in the original or historical cost figures. An appraisal of the item should be made on the basis of all the
relevant facts.
3. There is no warrant for this court's elimination frcm
the agreed inventory of standby plants which were included by the commission and district court.
4. There has been no appraisal of going value. That
element was arbitrarily excluded below. There is no
rational foundation for the amount attributed to it here.
5. As the commission's refusal to apply principles of
valuation established by our decisions resulted in arbitrary undervaluations, the prescribed rates should on
that ground be set aside.
.6. The decree appealed from should be vacated and the
case remanded for compliance with Rule 70 .
7. The district court should refer the case to a special
master to report in accordance with the practice followed
in cases such as this.

HARRISONVILLE v. W. S. DICKEY CLAY
MANUFACTURING CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 559.

Argued March 20, 1933.-Decided May 8, 1933

1. Although the nuisance be clear, relief by injunction against continuous or recurrent pollution of a stream may be denied where
substantial redress can be afforded the injured landowner by payment of money and where an injunction would subject the defendant
to grossly disproportionate hardship. Pp. 337-338.
2. If an important public interest would be prejudiced by the in-'
junction the reasons for denying it may be compelling. P. 338.
3. In this case an injunction would compel a city either to abandon
its sewage disposal plant, constructed at large cost, and revert

Opinion of the Court.

to primitive methods, or to erect an expensive' auxiliary plant,
which it feels unable to do; while, on the other hand, the damage
to the plaintiff's farm from the stream pollution complained of
,isrelatively small, ah a measurable in money. Held:
(1) That an injunction should be denied, conditional however
upon prompt payment of an amount equal to the depreciation irk
the value of the farm on account of the nuisance. P. 339.
(2) This payment is required, not upon the ground that the nuisance is permanent, but upon the ground that to oblige the landowner to bring repeated actions at law for loss of rentAl would be
so onerous as to deny adequate relief. P. 339.
4. Possession by a city of the right to condemn land that is subjected to effluent from its sewerage system favors rather than
opposes resort to money compensation instead of an injunction,
for relief of the injured landowner. P. 340.
5. Where a nuisance resulting from pollution of a creek by effluent
from a city sewage disposal plant could at any time have been
removed by the city by providing auxiliary sewage treatment, the
nuisance can not be deemed permanent as of the date of the installation of the disposal plant, and the statute of limitations on a suit
for abatement did not run from that date. P. 341.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court,

W. S. Dickey Clay Manufacturing Company, a Delaware Corporation, owns a stock farm of 300 acres lying
near the sewage disposal plant of the City of Harrisonville, Missouri. A small, meandering, intermittent
stream called Town Creek flows through a detached portion of the farm, consisting of 100 acres, devoted solely

'fo pasturage. Since 1923, a drain pipe has discharged
into the creek, at a point in the pasture, the effluent from
the disposal plant of the City's general sevage system.
In 1928, the Company brought, in the federal court for
western Missouri, this suit against the City, alleging injury to the property through drainage of the effluent
from the disposal plant and seeking both damages and an
injunction. The land was acquired by the Company in
1925 and has been leased ever since. Prior to ,1925 it
was owned by W. S. Dickey, the president and majority
stockholder of the Company, who is a resident of Missouri. Jurisdiction of the federal court is based solely
on diversity of citizenship. No federal question, constitutional or statutory, is involved.
The disposal plant consists of an Imhofftank and the
drain. It was installed by the City in 1923, aftbr conference with the Public Health Department of the State;
and has since been in continuous use. The tank is 4
primary method of sewage disposal which removes only
sixty per cent. of the putrescible organic matter An additional plant for further treatment of the sewage, which
would have removed thirty per cent. more of such matter,
could have been installed in 1923. But such additional
treatment was not then common in Missouri; nor was it
then recommended by the Health Department. In 1928,
additional treatment of the sewage was recommended by
it; but was not required. The population of the City is
2000; but only about 1400 of the inhabitants are served
by the general sewage system. The cost of the general
sewage system and disposal plant was about $60,000. The
cost of a secondary disposal plant would be $25,000 to
$30,000. It is asserted by the City that it cannot erect
such a plant now because it has no surplus revenues and
its borrowing capacity is nearly exhausted.
The District Court found that the detached portion of
the Company's land used for pasturage is seriously affected
by the pollution of Town Creek; that the aggregate loss

Opinion of the Court.

in rental for the five years during which it owned the land
had been $500; and that it would cost $3500 .to restore
the creek to the condition existing prior to the nuisance.
The court, therefore, awarded damages in the sum of
$4000. It held, also, that the Company was entitled to
an injunction; but allowed the City six months within
which to abate the nuisance by introducing some method
that would prevent the discharge of putrescible tewage
into the creek. Upon an appeal by the City, the Circuit
Court of Appeals modified the decree by eliminating therefrom the item of $3500 damages. As so modified the decree was affirmed. 61 F. (2d) 210. The Company acquiesced in the modification; and in this Court the City did
not question the propriety of the award of $500 damages.
But, oi the ground that the injunction should have been
denied, it petitioned for a Writ of certiorari, which was
granted. 288 U.S. 594.'
The City contends that the injunction should not issue,
because, according to the law of Missouri, the sewer system and disposal plant constitute a permanent nuisance;
that in granting the injunction instead of requiring the
Company to seek damages for the depreciation of the
property, the federal courts acted in direct conflict with
the law of the State; and that since the question involved
is in essence the extent of rights incident to ownership of
real property, the state law is controlling. The Company
denies that under the decisions of the state courts the
nuisance is to be deemed a permanent one; and insists that
for this continuing nuisance the remedy of damages is
inadequate.
First. The discharge of the effluent into the creek is a
tort; and the nuisance, being continuous or recurrent, is
an injury for which an injunction may be granted. Thus,
the question here is not one of. equitable jurisdiction.
The question is whether, upon the facts found, an injunction is the appropriate remedy. For an injunction is

not a remedy which issues as of course. Where substantial redress can be afforded by the payment of money and
issuance of an injunction would subject the defendant to
grossly disproportionate hardship, equitable relief may
be denied although the nuisance is indisputable. This is
true even if the conflict is between interests which are primarily private. Compare Parlker v. Winnipiseogee Lake
Cotton & Woolen Co., 2 Black 545, 552-553.1 Where an
important public interest would be prejudiced, the reasons
for denying the injunction may be compelling.2 See Osborne v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 147 U.S. 248, 258, 259;
New York City v. Pine, 185 U.S. 93, 97; Cubbins v. Mississippi River Commission, 204 Fed. 299, 307.V Such we
think is the situation in the case at bar.

F. (2d) 621. In these cases the interest of the community was ncidentally involved. See, however, cases of physical occupation of the
land, constituting a continuing trespass, where the plaintiff was confined to an action for damages because the injury was small and an
injunction would have imposed a great burden on the defendant.

Opinion of the Court.

If an injunction is granted the courses open to the City
are (a) to abandon the present sewage disposal plant,
erected at a cost of $60,000, and leave the residents to
the primitive methods theretofore employed, if the State
authorities should permit; or (b) to erect an auxiliary
plant at a cost of $25,000 or more, if it should be legally
and practicallypossible to raise that sum.. That expenditure would be for a desirable purpose; but the City, feels
unable to make it. On the other hand, the injury to the
Company is wholly financial. The pasture land affected
by the effluent would be worth, it was said, $50 or $60 an
acre if the stream were freed from pollution. Denial of
the injunction would, subject the Company to a loss in
value of the land amounting, on the basis of the trial
court's findings, to approximately $100 per year. That
loss can be measured by the reduction in rental or the
depreciation in che market value of the farm, assuming
the nuisance continues; and canbe made-good by the payment of money. The compensation payable would obviously be small as compared with the cost of installing
an auxiliary plant, for the annual interest on its cost
would be many times the annual loss resulting to the Company from the nuisance. Complete monetary redress
may be given in this suit by making denial of an injunction conditional upon prompt payment as compensation
of an amount equal to the depreciation in value of the
farm on account of the nuisance complained of. We require this payment not on the ground that the nuisance is
to be deemed a permanent one as contended,4 but because

to oblige the Company to bring, from time to time, actions
at law for its loss in rental would be so onerous qs to deny
to it adequate relief.
Second. By the Company it is contended .that the City
should be enjoined because it had the power to condemn
the land or its use for sewage purposes. The City questions the existence of that power. We have no occasion
to determine this issue of Missouri law. Possession of the
right of condemnation would afford added reason why
compensation should be substituted for an injunction.5
See Osborne v. Missouri Pacific Ry., 147 U.S. 248, 259;
Winslox v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 188 U.S. 646, 660;
Kamper v. Chicago, 215 Fed. 706, 708; Woodlawn Trust
& Savings Bank v. Drainage DistrictNo. 2, 251 Fed. 568,

570.
Third. By the City it is contended that under the
Missouri law a permanent nuisance was created when the
disposal plant was installed in 1923; that the cause of
ing therefrom can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the diminution in the value of the-property is immediately recoverable as
damages. Highland Ave. & Belt R. Co. v. Matthews, 99 Ala. 24;

338-339; Ridley v. Seaboard & Roanok R. Co., 118 N.C. 996, 1009;
4 S.E, 730. In some ,States the doctrine has been rejected. E. g.,
Pond v. Metropolitan Elev. Ry. Co., 112 N.Y. 186; 19 N.E. 487..
But in New York permanent damages may be imposed in equity as a
condition of withholding an injunction, where the defendant has the
right of eminent domain. Pappenheimv. MetropolitanElev. Ry. Co.,

Opinion of the Court.

action therefor accrued then to the, Company's grantor;
thatIthis cause of action did not pass to the Company, and,
indeed, has been barred by !hp statute of limitations;
and that, hence, both injunction and damages should be
denied. We have no occasion to determine the Scope of
the doctrine of permanent nuisance as applied in Missouri;G nor need we consider to what extent the local law
on that ,subject would be accepted as controlling in the
federal courts. This nuisance has at all times been removable by the device of secondary treatment of the sewage.,"
It may be hereafter abated at any time by the State health
authorities requiring such treatment. The City' may
itself conclude that this *should be done in the public
interest, financial. or otherwise. Being so termin'able, pollution of the creek cannot be deemed to be a permanent
nuisance as of the date of the installation of the disposal
plant in 1923.
The decree is reversed and the cause remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings to determine the
depreciation in value of the 'property on account of the
nuisance, and to enter a,decree withholding an injunction
if such sum be paid withiri the time to be fixed by that
court.
Reversed.

cases by the Missouri courts. Smnith v. Sedalia, 244 Mo. 107; 149

is single and arises at the time of the first injury, and that tht statute
