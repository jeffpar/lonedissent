ROGERS v. HILL ET

AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 732.

Argued May 11, 1933.-Decided May 29, 1933.

1. In a stockholder's suit to compel corporate officers to account for
money received as extra compensation and to enjoin further payments, the plaintiff moved on the pleadings for judgment or, in
the alternative, that payments be enjoined pendente lite. The
District Court without passing on the merits, granted the temporary injunction. On appeal from the order, the Court of Appeals
dealt with the merits adversely to the plaintiff in its opinion, but
its decree merely reversed the injunction order and directed that
mandate issue in accordance with "this decree "; and the mandate
directed further proceedings in accordance with "the decision" of
the court. Upon receiving the mandate, the District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits, which was affirmed
by decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals on a second appeal.
Held:
(1) That the mandate did not direct the dismissal; and that
the decree on the second appeal was the final decree on the merits,
reviewable in this Court by certiorari. P. 586.
of a case is its judgment. Its
(2) A court's "decision"
"opinion" is its statement of reasons for the judgment. P. 587.
(3) The Judicial Code, §§ 128 and 238, uses "decision" as the
equivalent of "judgment" and "decree." Id.
(4) Even if the mandate on the first appeal were deemed to
have included the opinion, the District Court, in its sound discretion, might still have allowed the plaintiff, on adequate showing,
to file additional pleadings, vary or expand the issues and take
other proceedings to enforce the accounting sought. Wells Fargo
& Co. v. Taylor, 254 U.S. 170. Id.
2. Section 11 of c. 185, General Corporation Act of New Jersey,
provides: "The power to make and alter by-laws shall be in the
stockholders, but any corporation may, in the certificate of incorporation, confer that power upon the directors; by-laws made by
the directors under power so conferred may be altered or repealed
by the stockholders." Held, that stockholders are not divested

of power to make or alter by-laws by delegation of that power to
the directors in their charter. P. 588.
3. Compensation of an officer of a corporation, whether by fixed
salary or by a percentage of profits, is part of the operating expenses deductible from earnings in ascertaining net profits. P. 590.
4. Extra compensation to officers of a corporation from a profitsharing arrangement, though allowed by a standing by-law enacted
at a stockholders' meeting, and though reasonable and legal at
the beginning, may become so great in later years, due to increases in the business and profits of the corporation, as to warrant investigation in equity in the interest of the company. P. 591.
5. Such a by-law is supported by the presumptions of regularity and
continuity and much weight is to be given the action of the stockholders in adopting it; but the rule prescribed by it can not, against
the protest of a shareholder, be used to justify payments so large
as in substance and effect to amount to spoliation or waste of corporate property. P. 591.

District Court, which, after an interlocutory appeal from
an injunction order, dismissed two consolidated suits

Opinion of the Court.
MR.

JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The American Tobacco Company is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey. The petitioner,
plaintiff below, acquired in 1916 and has since been the
owner of 200 shares of its common stock. He also has

400 shares of common stock B. In accordance with bylaw XII,' adopted by the stockholders at their annual
meeting, March 13, 1912, the company for many years
has annually paid its president.and vice-president large
'Section 1. As soon as practicable after the end of the year 1912
and of each year of the Company's operations thereafter, the Treasurer of the Company shall ascertain the net profits, as hereinafter
defined, earned by the Company during such year, and if such net
profits exceed the sum of $8,222,245.82, which is the estimated amount
of such net profits earned during the year 1910 by the businesses that
now belong to the Company, the Treasurer shall pay an amount equal
in the aggregate to ten per cent of such excess to the President and
five Vice-Presidents of the Company in the following proportions,
to wit: One-fourth thereof, or 21/2 per cent of such amount, to the
President; one-fiffh of the remainder thereof or 11/2 per cent of such
amount, to each of the five Vice-Presidents as salary for the year, in
addition to the fixed salary of each of said officers . ..
Section 3. For the purpose of this By-Law the net profits earned by
the Company in any year shall consist of the net earnings made by the
Company in its business as a manufacturer and seller of tobacco and
its products after deducting all expenses and losses, such provisions as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company for
depreciation and for all outstanding trade obligations, and an additional amount equal to 6 per cent dividends on $52,459,400 of its
6 per cent preferred stock, to which profits shall be added, or from
which profits shall be deducted, as the case may be, the Company's
proportion (based on its stock holdings) of the net profits or losses
for the year of its subsidiary companies engaged in the manufacture
and sale of smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, or little
cigars, except earnings on preference shares of British-American Tobacco, Limited, and shares of Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great
Britain and Ireland), limited....
Section 5. This By-Law may be modified or repealed only by the
action of the stockholders of the Company and not by the directors.

amounts in addition to their fixed salaries 2ahd other sums
allowed them as compensation for services.
Plaintiff maintains that the by-law is invalid and that,
-even if valid, the amounts paid under it are unreasonably
large and therefore subject to revision by the courts. In
March, 1931, he demanded that the company bring suit
against the officers who have received such payments to
compel them to account to the company for all or such
part thereof as the court may hold illegal. The company,
insisting that such a suit would be without .basis in law
or fact, refused to comply with his demand. He brought
suit in the supreme court of New York against the president and some of the vice-presidents to require them so
to account, and joined the company as defendant. The
case was removed to the federal court for the southern
district of New York. In May, 1931, plaintiff brought
suit in that court against Taylor, a vice-president, not a

defendant in the earlier suit, to require him to account
and made the company defendant.

The cases were con-

solidated, plaintiff filed an amended complaint and defendants answered. The officers of the company now
before the court are Hill, the president, Neiley, Riggio and
Taylor, vice-presidents. The answer, after admissions,
denials and explanations asserts several separate defenses.
Plaintiff made a motion on the pleadings for judgment
that the separate defenses be stricken, the by-law be
adjudged invalid and defendants Hill, Neiley and Riggio
be required to account for amounts so paid them and that
further payments be enjoined; and in the alternative that
such payments be restrained pendente lite. After argument upon the motion, the court, without decision\ upon
any other question, granted a temporary injunction. Defendants appealed, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the interlocutory order and directed that a mandate issue
to the District Court "in accordance with tlhis decree.'!
See 60 F. (2d) 109. The mandate directed further proceedings in accordance with "the decision." On the coming down of the mandate, the district court vacated the
temporary injunction and dismissed the bills of complaint
upon the merits. Plaintiff appealed, the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed, 62 F. (2d) 1079, citing its opinion on the
former appeal, and this court granted plaintiff's petition
for writ of certiorari.
Defendants, renewing a contention made in opposition
to the petition for certiorari, assert that the appellate
court on the first appeal determined in favor of defendants all the issues presented by the complaint, and maintain that, no application for certiorari having been made
within three months after that decision, the only question
that this court now has power to decide is whether the.
mandate directed dismissal.
We are of opinion that the mandate did not direct
dismissal. The granting of temporary injunction involved

no determination of the merits. Such a decree will not be
disturbed on appeal except for improvident allowance,
violation of the rules of equity or abuse of discretion.
National Fire Ins. Co. v. Thompson, 281 U.S. 331, 338.
Meccano, Ltd. v. John Wanamaker, 253 U.S. 136, 141.
Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, 165 U.S. 518, 526. The
opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals did indeed deal
with matters affecting the merits, but the decree did not
extend beyond mere reversal of the order from which
the appeal was taken. It directed that mandate issue in
accordance with "this decree." The mandate commanded
proceedings in accordance with "the decision." A direction for proceedings in accordance with "the opinion"
makes it a part of the mandate. Gulf Refining Co. v.
United States, 269 U.S. 125, 136. Here the mandate was
to proceed not in accordance with the "opinion" but with
the "decision." These words, while often loosely used
interchangeably, are not equivalents. The court's decision of a case is its judgment thereon. Its opinion is a
statement of the reasons on which the judgment rests.
Houston v. Williams, 13 Cal. 24, 27. Adams v. Yazoo &
M. V. R. Co., 77 Miss. 194, 304; 24 So. 200, 317; 28 So.

Coffeyv. Gamble, 117 Iowa 545, 548; 91 N.W. 813. The
Judicial Code uses " decision" as the equivalent of " judg-

ment" and "decree." §§ 128, 238. As a mandate in the
words of the decree was unquestionably sufficient to give
effect. to the ruling of the appellate court, "decision "
may not reasonably be held to have been used for
"opinion."
Moreover, if the court intended to direct dismissal, it
is to be presumed that it would have done so unequivocally and directly by means of language, form of decree
and mandate generally employed for that purpose. But,
assuming it included the opinion, the mandate would not
prevent the district court in the exercise of. a sound dis-

cretion from allowing plaintiff, were adequate showing
made, to file additional pleadings, vary or expand the
issues and take other proceedings to enforce the accounting sought by his bills of complaint. Wells Fargo& Co. v.
Taylor, 254 U.S. 175, 182. Metropolitan Water Co. v.
Kaw Valley District, 223 U.S. 519, 523. Mutual Life
Insurance Co. v. Hill, 193 U.S. 551, 553. Smith v. Adams,
130 U.S. 167, 177. In any view of the Ihatter, it is clear
that the decree of the appellate court was not final and
that plaintiff, in order to have the validity of the payments considered here, was not bound within three
months after entry to petit.ion this court for a writ of
certiorari.
Plaintiff contends that the stockholders were not authorized to adopt the by-law under which the payments
were made.
Section 11, General Corporation Act, Laws, 1896, c. 185,
provides: "The power to make and alter by-laws shall
be in the stockholders, but any corporation may, in the
certificate of incorporation, confer that power upon the
directors; by-laws made by the directors under power so
conferred may be altered or repealed by the stockholders."
The charter empowers the directors to make and alter
by-laws. But plaintiff argues that the stockholders having delegated to the directors authority to adopt by-laws
lost the power to adopt the one in question. That is
inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. Power to
prescribe rules for the government of business corporations reasonably is deemed an incident of ownership and
the voting power of the shares. It is quite generally
conferred by statute or charter provisions upon the stockholders. Here the statutory grant to them is plenary.
The charter provision is subordinate and not inconsistent.
There are many thousand holders of shares of this corporation. Their annual meetings are the only regular

ones, but the directors meet frequently. The company's
business is extensive and complex and considerations of
convenience may have suggested delegation to directors
of authority to make and alter by-laws.
That the statute did not intend to divest stockholders
is clear; for it expressly makes by-laws passed by directors
subject to alteration and repeal by the stockholders. in
the absence of statutory provision definitely and clearly
disclosing that intention, a charter provision, or by-law
adopted by incorporators or shareholders, delegating
power to directors, may not reasonably be held to take
from the stockholders any of the power conferred upon
them by the statute. Plaintiff's contention would leave
the stockholders full power to alter and repeal by-laws
made by directors, but would deny them power to originate or adopt any by-law or to amend or repeal those
made by themselves. We find no reason in support of
that construction. Moreover, it seems in direct conflict
with the decision of the highest court of New Jersey.
In the case of Griffing Iron Co., 63 N.J.L. 168; 41 Atl.
931, affirmed in the Court of Errors and Appeals on the
opinion below, 63 N.J.L. 357; 46 Atl. 1097, the court
declared (p. 171):

.

That the stockholders had

delegated to the directors power to amend the by-laws
did not curtail their own power to amend them, and
of course the later statute [Revision, 18961 removed all
possible restriction on such power

.

.

.

It would

be preposterous to leave the real owners of the corporate
property at the mercy of their agents, and the law has
not done so." The plaintiff cites and quotes from Scott
v. P. Lorillard Co., 108 N.J.Eq. 153; 154 Atl. 515, affirmed
109 N.J.Eq. 417; 157 Atl. 388. But, when regard is had
to the questions considered in that case, there is nothing
in tho opinion that lends support to his contention. It
cannot be sustained.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

289 US.

Plaintiff suggests that, because the by-law purports to
direct payments out of profits, it violates charter provisions which he construes to require the directors to
apply all profits to the acquisition of property and the
payment of dividends. We need not examine the charter,
for the contention rests upon a misapprehension of the
meaning of "profits" as used in the by-law. As there
defined it includes the sums to be paid to the president
and vice-presidents. Compensation to an officer for his
services constitutes a part of operating expenses deductible from earnings in order to ascertain net profits. It
is immaterial whether such compensation is a fixed
salary or depends in whole or in part upon earnings.
There is no conflict between the charter and the by-law.
Bennett v. Millville Improvement Co., 67 N.J.L. 320,
323; 51 Atl. 706. Booth v. Beattie, 95 N.J.Eq. 776; 118
Atl. 257; 123 Atl. 925.
It follows from what has been shown that when adopted
the by-law was valid. But plaintiff alleges that the measure of compensation fixed by it is not now equitable or
fair. And he prays that the court fix and determine the
fair and reasonable compensation of the individual defendants, respectively, for each of the years in question.
But the allegations of the complaint are not sufficient to
permit consideration by the court of the validity or reasonableness of any of the payments on account of fixed
salaries, or of special credits, or of the allotments of stock
therein mentioned. Indeed, plaintiff alleges that other
proceedings have been instituted for the restoration of
special credits, and his suits to invalidate the stock allotments were recently considered here. Rogers v. Guaranty
Trust Co., 288 U.S. 123. The only payments that plaintiff
by this suit seeks to have restored to the company are the,
payments made to the individual defendants under the
by-law.

ROGERS v. HILL
582

Opinion of the Court.

We come to consider whether these amounts are subJect to examination and revision in the district court.
As the amounts payable depend upon the gains of the business, the specified percentages are not per se unreasonable.
The by-law was adopted in 1912 by an almost unanimous
vote of the shares represented at the annual meeting and
presumably' the stockholders supporting the measure acted
in good faith and according to their best judgment. The
tabular statement in the margin shows the payments to
individual defendants under the by-law. Plaintiff does
not complain of any made prior to 1921. Regard is to be
had to the enormous increase of the company's profits in
recent years. The 2/2 per cent. yielded President Hill
$447,870.30 in 1929 and $842,507.72 in 1930. The 1Y2
per cent. yielded to each of the vice-presidents, Neiley and
Riggio, $115,141.86 in 1929 and $409,495.25 in 1930 and
for these years payments under the by-law were in addition to the cash credits and fixed salaries shown in the
statement.
While the amounts produced by the application of the
prescribed percentages give rise to no inference of actual
or constructive fraud, the payments under the by-law
have by reason of increase of profits become so large as to
warrant investigation in equity in the interest of the
company. Much weight is to be given to the action of
the stockholders, 'and the by-law is supported by the presumption of regularity and continuity. But the rule prescribed by it cannot, against the protest of a shareholder,
be used to justify payments of sums as salaries so large
as in substance and effect to amount to spoliation or waste
of corporate property. The dissenting opinion of Judge
Swan indicates the applicable rule: "If a bonus payment
has no relation to the value of services for which it is
given, it is in reality a gift in part and the majority
stockholders have no power to give away corporate prop-

erty against the protest of 'the minority." -60 F. (2d)
109, 113. The facts alleged by plaintiff are sufficient to
require that the district court, upon a consideration of
all the relevant facts brought forward by the parties,
determine whether and to what extent payments to the
individual defendants under the by-law constitute misuse
and waste of the money of the corporation. Booth v.
Beattie, 95 N.J.Eq. 776; 118 Atl. 257; 123 Atl. 925.

The separate defenses set up in the answer to the
amended complaint are: failure-of plaintiff to comply
with Equity Rule 27, ratification, forum non conveniens,
laches, and that the payments were justified. As they
were not passed on below, we refrain from expressing
opinion concerning them. The decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals is reversed, the decree of the district
court dismissing the bills on the merits is vacated, and the
case is remanded to the district court with directions to
reinstate its decree granting injunction pendente lite and
for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
