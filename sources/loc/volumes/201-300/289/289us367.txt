CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 634. Argued April 10, 11, 1933.-Decided May 8, 1933.

1. A schedule of refunds and credits was signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and sent to the Collector together with

a check to be delivered to a taxpayer for the making of a refund
entered on the schedule. Held that, in the absence of notice and
delivery to the taxpayer, the Commissioner retained the right to
revoke his action and there was no account stated. P. 370.

consent of the parties to it. P. 370.
3. The ruling in Bonwit Teller & Co. v. Utdted States, 283 U.S.
258, by which a specific limitation on the time for filing claims
for the recovery of taxes is set aside and superseded whenever

1919, it was dismissed upon the ground that suit had not
been brought within the time prescribed by law. 59 F.
(2d) 842; 1 F. Supp. 771. A writ of certiorari, restricted
to the assessment for 1919, brings the case here.
The Commissioner, upon an audit of the petitioner's
returns, found underassessments for 1916, 1917, and 1920,
and overassessments for 1918 and 1919. A notice of the
result of the audit was mailed to the petitioner on November 10, 1923, the notice by its terms being provisional
and tentative. Later, and on January 31, 1924, the
Commissioner signed a schedule of overassessments,
$22,151.88 for 1918, and $2,628.26 for 1919, and forwarded
.the schedule to the Collector of the District of Oklahoma,
the petitioner's residence. In accordance with the practice of the bureau, the Collector was instructed to examine, the accounts of the taxpayer and apply the excess
payments as a credit against taxes due for other years,
Upon such examination the Collector found that there'
were additional assessments, still unpaid, for 1916, 1917,
and 1920, in the sum of $11,277.24. This left an excess for
1918 of $10,874.64, and one of $2,628.26 for 1919, a total
of $13,502.90. Upon that basis the Collector made out a
schedule of refunds and credits, which he returned to the
Commissioner with the schedule of overassessments.
At this stage complications developed by reason of the
tax liability of a partnership of which petitioner was a
member. The partnership owed the Government more
'than fifty thousand dollars, the amount of an excess profits tax for 1917, though the precise extent of the indebtedness was still undetermined. In anticipation of an assessment, petitioner had filed with the bureau an agreement
and dire tion that any refund due to him individually for
the year 1918 (but without mention of any other year)
should be applied as a credit upon the taxes owing from
the partnership. When the, schedule of refunds and credits came back from the Collector, the Commissioner over-

looked the order, then on file in his office, for the merger
of the two accounts, and dealt with them as separate.
He made an additional assessment against the partnership
for $53,012.47. On the same day, March 29, 1924, he
signed an approval of the schedule of refunds and credits
without applying any part of the overpayment to the partnership liability, and made out a check to the order of the
petitioner for $13,502.90, which he mailed to the Collector.
The Collector discovered the mistake, and instead of delivering the check returned it to the Commissioner.
Thereupon the Commissioner canceled the check, revoked
his earlier instructions, and ordered the Collector to apply
the overpayments made by the petitioner individually
upon the deficiency then owing from the members of the
partnership. This order was proper to the extent of
$10,874.64, the 1918 overpayment, for the credit to that
extent was in accordance with the petitioner's agreement.
It was an error in so far as it included the 1919 overpayment ($2,628.26), for the petitioner's agreement did not
cover that year. The Collector did what the Commissioner commanded. No notice, however, of his action was
transmitted to the taxpayer. There was no delivery to
the taxpayer of a certificate of overassessment. There was
no delivery of a copy of any schedule of refunds and credits. Six years went by, almost to the day, without demand
or protest. Then, on March 28, 1930, the petitioner began
this suit, asking judgmeift for $24,780.14 with interest.
He repudiated all the credits against the partnership deT
ficiency, as well as other credits which there is no need to
go into, for he allowed them later on. At the trial the
contest narrowed down to 'two items. The first, $16,874.64, is the overpayment for 1918, as it stood before it
was applied upon the partnership assessment. The second, $2,628.26, is the overpayment for 1919. The writ of
certiorari brings up the second item to the exclusion of
any other.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

289 U.S.

By § 3226 of the Revised Statutes as amended by
the Revenue Act of 1921, no suit may be maintained for
the recovery of any internal revenue, tax erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected unless begun within five
years from the date of payment. Revenue Act of 1921,
c. 136, 42 Stat. 26, § 1318, amending R.S. § 3226; 26
U.S. Code, § 156. This suit was not brought within the
time so limited. It is therefore too late, if it is a suit
for the recovery of a tax within the meaning of the statute. The petitioner insists that it is not such a suit, but
one upon an account stated. The statement of an account gives rise to . new cause of action with a new term
of limitation. Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, 283
U.S. 258, 265. We are thus brought to the question
whether there was such a statement here.
If the traditional tests, familiar to the law of contracts, are to be accepted as our guide, there was no account stated between Government and taxpayer. No
balance was arrived at as the result of computation and
agreement. Volkening v. DeGraaf, 81 N.Y, 268, 271.
The Commissioner did not inform the taxpayer that the
tax had been overpaid in a determinate amount. The
taxpayer did not give assent either expressly or by silence
to the outcome of the audit. The essentials of an account
stated in any strict or proper senqe are lacking altogether.
Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 333; Nutt v. United
States, 125 U.S. 650, 655; Volkening v. DeGraaf, supra;
Newburger-Morris Co. v. Talcott, 219 N.Y. 505, 511, 512;
114 N.E. 846. A different situation was disclosed in the
Bonwit Teller case, supra. There the certificate of overassessment had been delivered to the taxpayer. "Upon
delivery of the certificate to plaintiff, there arose the
cause of action on which this suit was brought." Bonwit
Teller & Co. v. United States, supra, p. 265. Cf. Win. J.'

Opinion of the Court.

The argument is made, however, that the allowance of
the schedule of refunds and credits on March 29, 1924,
was something near to an account stated, something
"equivalent " thereto, though not the staridard article to
be marked by the standard label. This doctrine of equivalence is borne out, we are told, by cases in this court
and elsewhere, which were cited in the Bonwit Teller case
and are again pressed upon us .now. United States v.
Kaufman, 96 U.S. ,567, 575; United States v. Savings
Bank, 104 U.S. 728; First National Bank of Greencastle
v. United States, 15 Ct. Cls. 225. They fall short by a
great deal of teaching such a lesson. The Kaufman case
will serve as typical of the~others, for they' vary little in
their facts. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue had
been authorized by statute to make allowance to brewers
for the value of tax stamps lost or wasted, *He did make
such an allowance, and certified his ruling to the Comptr'ller of the Treasury. The claimant suing in the Court
of Claims to recover the amount of the award was met by
the objection that he must prove his claim anew. This
court held .that the allowance by ,the Commissioner was
effective without more to make out a prima facie case,
and spoke of it as at least "equivalent to an accouht
stated between private parties,, which is good, until impeached tor fraud or mistake." There was -no question
in the case as to the effect of the allowance in lifting the
bar of a statute of limitations, The claim had been seasonably filed and diligently pressed. There was-no ques,tion as to the effect of revocation or rescission. Cf. Ridgway v. United States, 18 Ct. Cls. 707, 714, 715. What
had been done by the Commissioner had never been undone. There was only the question as to the probative
force of an adjudication by an officer .who had been 'appointed to decide and had definitively decided. The statute had given him the position of an administrative tri-

bunal. He had done all that he could do. He had made
the allowance and had certified his action to the disbursing agents of the treasury, whose duty was not to revise,
but merely to obey. Notice of his action had been given
to the 'laimant, who had accepted and approved it.
Kaufman v. United States, 11 Ct. Cls. 659, 662. The suit
was on an award which had all the finality and authority
that an award could ever gain.
A very different situation is laid before us here. No
definitive adjudication in favor of this taxpayer was ever
made by the Commissioner or by other competent authority. The transaction never went beyond the stage of intradepartmerltal conference and parley. The Commissioner had put his hand, it is true, to a schedule of refunds
and credits, and had transmitted a check to one of his
subordinates to be delivered to the claimant. By none of
these acts had he so divested himself of control as to generate rights or interests in favor of the taxpayer if there was
revocation or rescission in advaiice of notice or delivery.
There had been messages back and forth between the officers and branches of an, administrative bureau. There
had beeft none to the outer, world. The Commissioner,
after sigaing the schedule, might scratch out his signature, and declare it inadvertent. Cf. Ridgway v. United
States, supra; Austin Co. v. Commissione, 35 F. (2d)
910. This in sukstance is what he did. After signing a
check and mailing it to his agent, he might cancel the
check while the agent still held it, and reVoke the authority improvidently granted. The matter was still in fieri.
High .public interests make it necessary that there be
stability and certainty in. the revenues of government.
These ends are not susceptible of attainment if periods of
limitation may be disregarded or extended. By the ruling
in the Bonwit Teller case a specific limitation applicable
to claims for the recovery of taxes is set aside and superseded whenever the statement of an account sustains the

inference of an agreement that the tax. shall be repaid:
As soon as this appears, a fresh term of limitation is born
and set in motion. It is a ruling not to be extended
through an enlargement of the concept of an account
stated by latitudinarian construction.
Girard Trust Co. v. United States, 270 U.S. 163, and
United States v. Swift & Co., 282 U.S. 468, are pressed
uponIus by counsel as helpful to the taxpayer. They do
not touch the case at hand. In the case of the Girard
Trust Co., a statute called foi interest on the amount of
the refund to the date of allowance. The claimant made
the point thai allowance was not perfected unless accompanied by payment, and that interest on the refund
should be correspondingly extended. The court rejecting
that contention held that allowance was complete within
the meaning of the statute when the schedule of refunds
was approved, by the Commissioner. *In the case of
Swift & Co., a like ruling was made as to the effect of the
approval -of a credit. . In neither case vas there. any
question as to the existence of an account stated, or as to
the effect of an imprqvident allowance, unknown to the
taxpayer.
The judgment is
Afrmed.
