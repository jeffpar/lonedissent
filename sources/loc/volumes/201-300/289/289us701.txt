Nos. 316, 317, and 318. UNITED, STATES v. DUBILIER
May 8, 1933. Ordered that the opinion in this case be amended as follows:.
By striking out the following paragraph:
"Moreover no court could, however clear the proof of
such a contract, order the execution of an assignment.
No act of Congress has been called to our attention authorizing the United States to take a patent or to hold
one by assignment. No statutory authority exists for the
transfer of a patent to any department or officer of the
Government, or for the administration of patents, or the
issuance of licenses on behalf of the United States. In
these circumstances no public policy requires us to deprive the inventor of his exclusive rights as respects the
general public and to lodge them in a dead hand incapable
of turning the patent to account for the benefit of the
public."

it to comply with the decree; (2) The amounts that shall
