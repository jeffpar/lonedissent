PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MONTANA

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA

No. 627.

Argued March 23, 24, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933

1. A specific rate fixed by a municipality on gas sold by a public
service corporation is not objectionable under the Fourteenth
Amendment because it prevents the-corporation from cutting its
rates below necessary cost in an effort to do away with ruinous
competition. P. 134.
2. An allegation merely asserting in general language that rates are
confiscatory is not sufficient to invoke constitutional protection.
The facts relied on must be specifically set forth and from them it
must clearly appear that the rates would necessarily deny to plaintiff just compensation and deprive it of its property without due
process of law. Aetna Insurance Co. -%.Hyde, 275 U.S. 440, 447.

Nagle, Attorney General of Montana, was on the brief,
for appellants.
Messrs. M. S. Gunn and E. G. Toomey for appellee.
Rates which, because of competition, will deprive a
utility of its patronage and may ultimately require it to
abandon the field to a competitor, are as objectionable
as rates which will not furnish a fair return where there
is no competition. The power of regulation does not
warrant confiscation, whether resulting from rates unreasonably low or from rates which will deprive the utility

gas furnished by a public utility, is repugnant to the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

289 U.S.

The appellee, authorized by a non-exclusive franchise
ordinance, has been engaged since 1923 in furnishing natural gas to consumers in Shelby, a Montana city having
a population of about 2,000. It has an adequate distribution system. September 21, 1927, the commission instituted an inquiry as to thd reasonableness of its rates.
The schedule then in force specified for each customer a
base rate of 60 cents per thousand cubic feet for the first
five thousand and, by steps, lower rates based on monthly
consumption.' Appellee filed a schedule, effective November 25, 1927, reducing the base rate to 50 cents.
The commission approved tentatively and continued investigation.
â€¢The Citizens Gas Company, similarly authorized, installed a distribution system and, in October, 1928, commenced furnishing natural gas to consumers in Shelby.
Its schedule, specifying a base rate of 35 cents, was approved by the commission. Within a brief period many
of appellee's customers left it, and have since obtained
their gas from the other company. In November appellee
filed and, though the commission did not approve, put in
force a schedule specifying a base rate of 20 cents. The
commission ordered it to submit evidence as to the reasonableness of such rates. Appellee did not support them
as adequate or compensatory, but insisted that under
competitive conditions then existing they were justified.
And it declared that should the Citizens company meet
them it would propose a further reduction.
The commission, January 22, 1929, found the 20 cent
schedule too low to yield enough to cover reasonable operating expenses including depreciation; that such rates
would tend to imperil or impair appellee's ability dependably to serve; held such schedule contrary to the public

and are conveniently identified by the highest or base rate.

interest; condemned the 50 cent schedule as unreasonable,
and prescribed a base rate of 35 cents, being precisely the
same as that filed by the Citizens company and approved
by the commission. Appellee refused to charge the rates
so ordered, and sued to enjoin the enforcement of the
order upon the ground that the commission was not empowered by statute to prescribe specific rates and that the
order violated the state constitution and the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court.
gave appellee judgment on the pleadings. July 29, 1930,
the supreme court sustained the order, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. 88
Mont. 180, 232; 293 Pac. 294.
The Citizens company had filed, January, 1930, and
without the commission's approval put in force a schedule
naming as a base rate 23 cents but subject to a reduction
of 3 cents for prompt payment. The record shows that,
notwithstanding appellee's reduction to the base rate of
20 cents and a further reduction, September 1, 1931, to
a flat rate of 15 cents, its sales of gas decreased from 129
million cubic feet in 1927 to 106 million in 1928, to 73 in
1929, to 67 in 1930, to 58 in 1931. The sales of the Citizens company have correspondingly increased. During
the first seven months of 1932, the latest period for which
the figures are given, appellee sold less than 40 million
cubic feet and the Citizens company sold over 67 million.
December 22, 1930, appellee brought this suit and dismissed the one in the state court. The district court
granted a temporary injunction against the enforcement
of the order on the ground that, as the utility necessarily
lowered its rates for self-preservation, the order prescribing higher rates was unreasonable and repugnant to the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a
concurring opinion one of the judges construed the complaint to charge confiscation, and maintained that the

order shows that the commission deliberately disregarded
*the rule entitling public utilities to a fair return and that
this, withput further evidence, was sufficient ground for
temporary injunction. 52 F. (2d) 802, 805. The commission appealed from the interlocutory decree and this
court affirmed. 285 U.S. 524. Upon the final hearing,
on evidence taken before an examiner, the district court
found that the community is insufficient to support, at
Tates affording fair return, the competing systems; that
the prescribed rates deprive app6llee of its right of competition and would fail to produce legitimate 'operating
expenses, taxes, depreciation and a fair return upon the
value of appellee's property. As its conclusions of law,
the court declared the order invalid and that the interlocutory injunction should be made permanent, 1 F. oupp.
328. It so decreed.
The rights conferred upon appellee by the authorizing
ordinance are subject not only to the proper exertion of
power of the State to regulate its services and rates, but
also to authority of the city to grant to others the privilege similarly to serve. The city was free to admit other
purveyors of gas. Madera Water Works v. Madera, 228
U.S. 454. Piedmont Power Co. v. Graham, 253 U.S. 193.
Springfield Gas Co. v. Springfield, 257 U.S. 66, 70. The
appellee does not complain that the rates imposed upon
it by the order differ from those which have been established and are binding on its competitor. The gravamen
of, its complaint is that the enforcement of the order will
deprive it of the "right bf competition in rates essential
to protection and preservation of its property and business," and of the "right to charge rates concededly less
than reasonable rates." The demand for gas in the community served is not sufficient to require both systems,
and there is no suggestion that it is likely to become great
enough to justify the expenditures made for them. The

facts disclosed by the record compel the conclusion that,
if competition shall continue in the future as in the past,
appellee will not be able. upon any rates within constitutional protection against reduction to earn a reasonable
return upon the value of its property. employed in the
public service. The due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment safeguards against the taking of private
property, or the compelling of its use, for the service of
the public without just compensation. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 362, 410. Smyth v. Ames,

it does not assure to public utilities the right under all
circumstances to have a return upon the value of the
property so used. The loss 6f, or the failure to obtain,
patronage, due to competition, does not justify the imposition of charges that are exorbitant and unjust to the
public. The clause of the Constitution here invoked does
not protect public utilities against such business hazards.

But appellee, having undertaken to serve under conditions permitting competition, now insists that it has a
constitutional right by unrestrained cutting of rates to
destroy the competitor. And for that purpose it has
made reductions from the 60 cent schedule in force until
shortly before the Citizens company entered the field to
the flat rate of 15 cents, which yields less than the necessary cost of the service. The commission found that the

rates specified in the 20 cent schedule are too low, unreasonable, liable to impair the service, and contrary to the
public interest. The decision of the state supreme court
is to the same effect. 88 Mont. 180, 218; 293 Pac. 294.
The facts disclosed by the record are not sufficient to
show that the exertion by the commission of its power to
prescribe specific rates was arbitrary or an infringement
of any constitutional right of the appellee. See Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U.S. 251, 273 et seq. United States
v. Illinois Central R. Co., 263 U'S. 515, 525. Mapleton

Natural Gas & Fuel Co., 34 S.W. (2d) 900, 902. Farmersville v. Texas-LouisianaPower Co., 55 S.W. (2d) 195, 200.
The appellee contends that the rates prescribed by the
order are so unreasonably low as to deprive it of just compensation. The appellants maintain that no such question is presented by the record. The complaint was
grounded upon the claim, not that the rates were too
low, but that the order prevented appellee from charging
lower ones. It prayed judgment that it be allowed to
charge less than the rates prescribed in the order. After
the evidence was taken, appellee proposed an amendment. It merely alleged that the rates prescribed "are
not sufficient to furnish plaintiff a fair or any return on
the value of its gas plant or system and such rates, if
made effective, would confiscate and deprive this plaintiff
of its property" without due process of law. Appellee
here admitted that its purpose in asserting the belated
claim that the rates specified in the order are too low was
not that it might collect more for its services but that it
might continue, once the order was set aside, to serve at
a loss and so if possible force the other company out of
the field. It is a well-established rule that an allegation
merely asserting in general language that rates are con-

UNITED STATES v. FLORES
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT O1. THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA

No. 567. Argued March 14, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933
1. The clause of the Constitution, Art. I, Â§ 8, specifically granting to
Congress the power "to define and punish piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations,"
and the general provision of Art. III, Â§ 2, extending the judicial
power "to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," are the
results of separate steps independently taken in the Convention, by
which the jurisdiction in admiralty, previously divided between the
Confederation and the States, was transferred to the National
Government. P. 146.
2. In view of the history of the two clauses and the manner of their
adoption, the grant of power to define and punish piracies and
felonies on the high seas can not be deemed to be a limitation on
the powers, either legislative or judicial, conferred on the National
Government by Art. III, Â§ 2. P. 149.
3. To. construe the one clause as limiting rather than supplementing
the other would be to ignore their history, and without effecting
any discernible purpose of their enactment, to deny to bqth the
States and the National Government powers which were common
attributes of sovereignty before the adoption of the Constitution,
including the power to define and punish crimes, of less gravity
than felonies, committed on vessels of the United States while on
the high seas, and crimes of every grade committed on them while
in. foreign territorial waters. P. 149.
4. The jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime cases extends to crimes
committed on vessels of the United States while in navigable waters
within the territorial jurisdiction of foreign sovereigns. P. 150.
