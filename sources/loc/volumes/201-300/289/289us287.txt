a contention had been made, there would have been no
difficulty in bringing before the Commission other stations
whose interests might be drawn in question. There is no
showing that the respondents were prejudiced by the operation of the order in question.
Respondents complain that they were not heard in
argument before the Commission. They were heard before the examiner and the evidence they offered was
considered by the Commission. The exceptions filed by
the applicant to the examiner's report were filed and
served 'upon the respondents in August, 1931, and the
decision of the Commission was made in. the following
October. While the request of the applicant for oral
argument was denied, it does not appear that any such
request was made by respondents or that they sought
any other hearing than that which was accorded.
We find no ground for denying effect to the Commission's action. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
reversed and the cause is remanded with direction to

No. 412. Argued February 7, 8, 1933.-Decided May 8, 1933
1. The legislative discretion implied in the rate-making power embraces the methods of reaching the legislative determination as
2well as the determination itself. P. 304.
2. While the method used in fixing rates of a public utility may have

to revise the legislative process, but is confined to the constitutional
question, whether the rates fixed are confiscatory. P. 304.
3. Up6n that question the party complaining has the burden of proof,
and the Court may not interfere unless the confiscation
is clearly
established. P. 305.
4. In determining whether a public utility has been deprived oi a
fair return for the service rendered the public in the use of its
property, the basis of calculation is the fair value of the property,
that is, its reasonable value at the time it is being used for the
public. P. 305.
5. The judicial ascertainment of values for the purpose, of deciding
wliether rates are confiscatory, is not a matter of formul.e, but
there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper
consideration of all relevant facts. P. 306.
6. The actual cost of the property is a relevant fact, but not an
exclusive or final test. P. 306.
7. The time and circumstances of the outlay and the effect of altered
conditions demand consideration. P. 306.
8. Even when cost is revised so as to reflect what may be deemed
to have been invested prudently and in good faith, the investment
may embrace property no longer used and useful for the public
good. P. 306.
9. The reasonable cost of an efficient public utility system is good
evidence 'of its value at the time of construction. P. 306.
10. Such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount
to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as,
there is no change in the level of applicable prices. P. 306.
11. When such change in the price level has occurred, actual experience in the construction and development of the property, especially
in a recent period, may be an important check on extravagant
estimates. P. 306.
12. In order to determine present value, the cost of reproducing the
property is a relevant fact. P. 307.
13. This Court has not decided that the cost of reproduction furnishes an exclusive test. P. 307.
14. The Court has emphasized the danger in resting conclusions upon
' estimates of a conjectural nature. P. 307.
15. The weight to be given to actual cost, to historical cost and to
cost of reproduction new, is to be determined on the facts of the
particular cas. P. 308.

16. Judicial notice taken of the high level of prices--of labor and
materials prevailing not only from 1917, as an incident of the War,
but also in 1922 and 1923, and that there was no "substantial
general decline" in such prices from that time to 1926. P. 308.
17. The Court finds no warrant for concluding that since 1917, when
the gas plant here in question was first valued by the state commission, there has been any change in prices of labor and materials
making it unfair, in fixing rates for the future, to take the historical
cost found by the commission, as evidence of the value of the company's structural property at the time of the rate order; it
clearly appearing that the prices of labor and materials reflected in
the historical cost were higher than those obtaining during the later
period to which the prescribed rates apply. P. 309.
18. A difference between the commission and the company as to the
amounts to be added for overheads in estimating historical cost,'
*becomes immaterial in this case, since the company's higher estimate of that cost is less than the amount taken by the commission
on the basis of fair value as an undepreciated rate base. P. 309.
19. In estimating cost of reproduction, items for financing and for
promoters' remuneration, which are merely conjectural, should not
be included. P. 310.
20. Plant facilities that have become unnecessary are not included
in estimating cost of reproduction as a bae for future rates. P. 311.
21. The determination of present value is not an end in itself, but is
to afford ground for a prediction of future values upon which to
determine valid future rates. P. 311.
22. Estimates of present value, taken as the cost of reproduction as
of December 31, 1929, based upon average prices from 1926 to 1929,
furnished no dependable criterion of values in the succeeding years#.
because of the serious decline of prices which the country was
facing in a depression amounting to a change of economic level.

of three judges, granted an interlocutory injunction and
on final hearing dismissed the bill. 58 F. (2d) 256. The
Company appeals.
The Company, organized in 1909, supplies both gas and
electric current. Its rates for the latter are not in controversy. The two departments, both with respect to investment and operation, are distinct and have been separately treated for rate-making purposes for many years.
From 1913, when natural gas in substantial quantities
was first made available in Los Angeles, until 1927, the
Company distributed a mixture of natural and manufactured gas, and since 1927 straight natural gas has ,been
distributed. The Company's service extends over the
greater part of Los Angeles and neighboring cities and
unincorporated territory. It has over 2,900 miles of mains
and 385,000 meters. From 1917 the Company's gas rates
have been fixed by the California Railroad Commission.
Rate orders were made in 1917, 1919, 1921, 1923, 1926
and 1928. During this period the Company's business
greatly increased. The rate base for its gas department,
as fixed by the Commission, grew from approximately
$12,500,000 in 1916 to about $59,000,000 in 1929. The
growth was financed by the sale of .the Company's bonds
and preferred stock. These, according to the finding of
the Commission, had been mariketed at a gradually lessening cost so that, at the time of the hearing which resulted
in the order under review, it was found that the "annual
cost of its bond and preferred stock money" was 6.17
per cent. Approximately 60 per cent. of the amounts thus
realized is chargeable to the gas department.1
1

Reviewing the financial history of the Company, the Commission
found: "On December 31, 1929, the Company had outstanding in the
hands of the public $47,070,000 par value of bonds, $19,469,995 par
value preferred stock, and $20,000,000 par value of common stock.
Its depreciation reserve on that date was reported at $16,804,105.15.
All of its common stock is owned by 'Pacific Lighting Corporation.

289 U.S.

Under the Commission's order of 1928, the gas rates
were estimated to yield a return slightly in excess of. 7.5
per cent. 32 C.R.C. 379, 386. Concluding that these
rates actually yielded a much higher return, the Commission reduced the rates by the order now under review. It
was intended to effect a reduction of 9 per cent. in gross
revenue. 35 C.R.C., pp. 463, 469. The reduction
amounted to about $1,300,000 in gross revenue and about
$1,080,000 in net revenue.
1. The Commission's valuations. In determining the
rate base, the Commission made two sorts of valuations
of the gas properties for the year 1930,-one of $60,704,000 on the basis of "historical cost," and the other
of $65,500,0C9 on the basis of "fair value." The Commission estimated, that the return to the Company on the
former basis would be 7.7 per cent. and, on the latter, 7
per cent. 35 C.R.C., p. 464.
Historical cost. The finding as to historical cost had
relation to the method previously adopted by the Commission in the regulation of the Company's rates. The
original rate base was established by the Commission in
1917 upon a valuation made by the Commission's engineers as of October, 1915. 13 C.R.C. 724.. In 'the later
rate proceedings, including the one now under review, the
$5,500,000, however, having been distributed to Pacific Lighting Corporation in the form of stock idividends, representing earnings left

in the property. Dividends have been paid on its common stock of
7.20 per cent. per share ($100 par value) in 1916, 1917 and 1918; 7.4
per cent. in 1919; 8.4 per cent. in 1920, 1921 and 1922; 8.7 per cent. in
1923; 33.75 per cent. in 1924, included in which is 25 per cent. as a
stock dividend of $2,500,000; 9 per cent. in 1925; 9.815 per cent. in
1926; 35.17 per cent. in 1927, which includes a stock dividend of 21.42
per cent., or $3,000,000; 15 per cent. in 1928, and 17 per cent. in 1929.
The Company's surplus has grown from $381,212.97 in 1916 to
$4,176,663.09 in 1929, while its depreciation reserve increased from
$3,804,383.36 to, as said above, $16,804,105.15." 35 C.R.C., pp. 447,

448.

287

Opinion of the Court.

historical cost was built upon the value established in
1917 augmented by net additions and betterments as
entered upon the Compaay's books, but with land at current values. 2 Of the total amount fixed by the Commission on the basis of historical cost, the sum of $1,862,103
was for materials and supplies, working capital and estimated net additions and betterments for 1930, leaving
$58,842,187 as the historical cost of the fixed property at
the end of 1929. Aside from overheads, the estimates
made by the Company and by the Commission of the historical cost of this property did not differ widely.' The
main difference lay in the treatment of overheads in the
book entries of additions and betterments from 1916 to
1929;- the Company contends that the amounts recorded in
its books in respect to indirect construction costs were in-

adequate.

The reference is to the amounts which should

'See 16 C.R.C. 478, 482; 20 id. 93, 96. 29 id. 164, 181; 32 id.
379, 381.
'The Commission found: "Estimates of the historical cost of the
structural property were made in this proceeding, both by. the Company and by the Commission's Valuation Department. Excluding
overheads, the Company reached a figure approximately $300,000
higher than the one obtained by taking the 1917 rate base as fixed by
the Commission in its first decision and building up on that, while
the Valuation Department of the Commission reached a figure approximately $300,000 lower than the one thus obtained. 'The fact
that each of these estimates, independently reached by employing
somewhat different methods and procedure, corresponded so closely
to the historical cost figure as used and accepted by the Commission
and by the Company' as correct in the series of rate determinations
running from 1917 to 1928, confirms its substantial accuracy. The
figure used conforms to the accounting practice of the Company as to
the bulk of its investment, which has increased from approximately
$13,000,000 in 1917 to over $58,000,000 in 1929, the difference representing net additions and betterments during this period as inscribed
in the Company's books and records. Mr. McAuliffe [the Commission's appraiser] and the Company's land appraiser were surprisingly
close in their results. In the few points of difference Mr. McAuliffe's
testimony was the more convincing." 35 C.R.C., p. 451.

be included for engineering and superintelidence, legal
expenses;, injuries and damages, insurance, taxes, interest
during construction and contingencies. The general instructions of the Commission as to classification of fixed
capital accounts provided that such overheads should be
assigned or apportioned to particular accounts so that
each item of property should bear its proper share, and a
considerable range of discretion in making allocations
rested with the Company. 35 C.R.C., p. 451. The Company had availed itself of this opportunity and the average charge on the Company's books for these costs from
1913 to 1929 was about 6 per cent. of the direct labor and
material charges. The Commission's engineers were of
the opinion that 11.25 per cent. might reasonably have been
charged to capital and, on that basis, the total historical
cost of fixed property would have been. raised from $58,842,187 to $61,019,662. The Company's engineers estimated that 14.48 per cent. should be allowed for these overheads, bringing that historical cost up to $63,413,246.
The Commission stated that its conclusions had been
reached upon the assumption that the Company's allocations in reporting additions and betterments were properly made, and that the effect of the long-continued practice of the Company was that it had been allowed under
the rate orders, in the form of operating expenses, the
items which it now claims should have been added to capital. The Commission thought that the Company was not
in a position to raise the question. The Commission
recognized an exception in the item of interest during construction which, when not charged to capital, had been
charged to income accounts and did not go into operating
expenses, and accordingly there was included in the Commission's finding of historical cost an additional allowance, for that interest, of $155,000 which the Commission
deemed to be fair. 35 C.R.C. 451-453.

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 295
287 •Opinion

of the Court.

No deduction was made from the total historical cost
for the investment in the generating plant and equipment which the Commission found were being rendered
unnecessary by the introduction of natural gas. In order
to meet the rapidly increasing demand, the gas manufacturing plant had been greatly expanded until in 1924
the Company had a plant of 98,500,000 cubic feet daily
capacity. The book value of this plant was approximately $10,000,000 and the amount included therefor
in the Company's estimate of historical cost was approximately $10,500,000. Since April, 1927, on account of
the supply of natural gas, the Company has not manufactured gas except on'one occasion, on March 13, 1928,
when, in anticipation of a shortage, a certain amount
(569,000. cubic feet) was manufactured which constituted
but nine-tenths of one per cent. of the gas sent out on
that day. The Commission found that the evidence
convincingly established "the existence of a natural gas
supply adequate for years to come." But as the investment in the manufacturing plant had been made prudently and in good faith, it was included by the Commission in the estimate of the historical .cost of the Company's gas properties.
In that estimate, as thus made, nothing was deducted
for depreciation and nothing was added for going concern
value.
Fairvalue. The Company claimed'before the Commission a rate base of approximately $95,000,030 on the basis
of reproduction cost new as of January 1, 1930, less accrued depreciation. 35 C.R.C., p. 456. On comparing
the Company's estimate as of that date with the estimate
of the Commission's engineer of reproduction cost new (of
December 31, 1929), in each case without deduction for
depreciation, it appears that the difference, exclusive of
overheads and the items mentioned below, was only about

296

289 U.S.

$3,000,000 in the valuation of the physical property.4 In
its estimate the Company included overheads at 24.27
per cent., or a total of $14,990,278. On that basis, the
value of the physical property was estimated by the
Company, without depreciation, at $76,754,919.' This
included $12,134,665 as the "reproduction value of the
standby manufacturing facilities," above mentioned.
The Company's witness testified before the Commission
(in 1930)' that in his estimate of reproduction cost he
had "attempted to obtain prices that would be'reasonably stable and might prevail over the next three years ";
that the prices used were "very close to the average of
those which prevailed for a 3-year period prior to January 1, 1930 "; and while in his 'opinion there was "a
temporary slump in prices," he did not think it probable
that there would be "any substantial, change within the
next two or three years."
The estimate of the Commission's engineer for reproduction cost new of the same physical property including
the gas manufacturing plant, as of December 31, 1929,
without depreciation, taking unit prices of that day and
overheads at 21.65 per cent., was $72,471,207. As of the
same date, but using four-year average unit prices for the
years 1926 to 1929, his estimate was $73,210,136, with
overheads taken at 22.32 per cent." His estimates on the
'The amount; exclusive of overheads, thus reacfibd by the Company
was $62,596,422, and by the Commission's engineer $59,413,008.
' This is the total of Items 2, 3 and 4 of the Company's valuation
of physical property, as shown in the Company's exhibit and set forth
in the.Commission's findings. 35 C.R.C., p. 456. This amount, with
Item 1 ($831,781) for " organization and franchises" make up the
total of $77,586,700 claimed by the Company as "the reproduction cost
new of its fixed property.
'Thehearing before the Commission was completed on July 16,
1930, and its order was made on November 24, 1930.
'This amount, with $427,406 allowed by the Commission's engineer
for "organization and franchises," makes the total of $73,637,542 as

Opinion of the Court.

last mentioned basis, but with overheads at 6 per cent. and
11.25 per cent., respectively, were $64,082,282 and $67,007,569.' With unit prices as of June 15, 1930, his estimates
for reproduction cost new as of that day, without depreciation, and with overheads at 6 per cent., 11.25 per cent.,
and 21:64 per cent., respectively, were $63,399,822, $66,291,307 and $72,040,522.'
In arriving at its total estimate of reproduction cost
new, the Company added to its valuation of its physical
property the items of "Cost of financing, $5,921,470,"
"Promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000," and" Going concern value, $9,228,667." These items the Commission
did not allow. The items of "cost of financing" and
"promoters' profits" were rejected as "too hypothetical
and far removed from actuality to properly find lodgment
in a rate base." The Company's claim for "going concern" value was based upon expert testimony which the
Commission regarded as involving unacceptable theories
and assumptions. 35 C.R.C.4 pp. 459, 460.
Depreciation. The Company estimated $3,470,326 for
accrued depreciation. The Commission found that this
was too little and that the accrued depreciation was not
less than $7,650,000. The Commission stated that this
amount was reached after a careful and detailed study involving a physical inspection of the property and analysis of the Company's records. Id., p. 461.
Commission's conclusion as to fair value. -The Commission's final conclusion was as follows: "Subject to deduction for accrued and realized depreciation in a sum of
approximately $7,650,000, the fair value of the property
the reproduction cost new of the fixed property which was covered by
the Company's estimate of $77,586,700.
"Adding the item of $427,406 (see Note 6), these estimates were
$64,509,688 and $67,434,975, as shown by the Commission's exhibit.
'Or, with the addition of $427,406 (see Note 6), these estimates
were $63,827,228, $66,718,713 and $72,467,928.

here involved as a going property with business attached,
giving full effect to the current level of prices and allowing for any intangible elements of value riot fully cared
for in the usual and current operating expense allowances
but excluding various built up claims of value incident to
a reproduction of the property under an assumed reconstruction program as too uncertain and hypothetical to
enter into a rate base figure, did not for the, year 1928,
using round figures,. exceed $62,500,000, and for the year
1929 $64,000,000, and for the year 1930 does not exceed
$65,500,000, which figures, for the 'purposes hereof, are
spoken of as rate base." These amounts included the
allowances (supra, p. 293) for additions and betterments
(for 1930) and for working capital, materials and supplies. Id., pp. 461, 462.
Although the accrued depreciation was thus treated by
the Commission as deductible, in order to arrive at fair
value, the Commission thought that operating results under the fair value theory could best be shown by using an
undepreciated rate base. The result is that the Commission allowed for the year 1930, as a basis for its calculation
of return, a valuation of $65,500,000 without deduction
for depreciation. Id., p. 462.
2. The Commission's estimate of return. Based upon
assumed revenue and operating expenses, and with allowance for a depreciation annuity and taxes, the Commission - estimated- that the Company would earn'a net return of. 7 per cent. upon this undepreciated rate base. The
Commission stated that the year 1930 was "in many respects an abnormal year"; that the temperatures had
been higher than normal, and that the business depression
had had an adverse effect upon the Company's growth and
revenue. Still it was found that the Company's business
was growing -and that with growth there was a tendency
for the rate of return to increase. The Commission rested

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 299
287

Opinion of the Court.

its conclusions "on the assumption that temperature conditions in the future will be normal and that business
conditions will approximate those of the year 1930 and
that the gross revenue of 1931 with normal temperatures
will not be less than that of 1930." The Commission
recognized that the revenue for 1930 might be less than
that estimated and, on the other hand,_ that the operating
expenses for that year were not at a normal figure. It
was thought that "any diminution in revenue is offset by
the amount by which operating expense is out of normal."
But the Commission clearly perceived that "the actual
earning position of the Company in the year 1931 " might
be "either worse or better than it would be were these
assumptions realized." It was thought that the disturb-'
ing element of varying temperatures might be guarded
against by the establishment of a temperature reserve.
The Commission pointed out that the depreciation reserve
of the gas department, on December 31, 1929, was
$9,350,689, which was "substantially in excess of the
amount of accrued depreciation." The annual amounts
which had been allowed for depreciation expense had
proved to be larger than necessary, and it was suggested
that a considerable part of the depreciation reserve might
be transferred to a temperature reserve. While, for the
present purpose, the Commission assufned that the creation of such a reserve was a matter of company policy, its
desirability was emphasized. The Commission's order of
November 24, 1930, establishing the rates here in question,
provided for the acceptance at the Company's option of
an alternative plan. This gave, in lieu of the rates prescribed, a provisional schedule of rates to be charged in
1931, and until the further order of the Commission,
-which was deemed to involve a reduction in revenue of
approximately 7 per cent., instead of 9 per cent. as otherwise contemplated, the Company to agree to establish

289 U.S.

a temperature reserve to which should be credited the
amount by which the net earnings of its gas department
for the year .1931 should be in excess of a stated sum.
This plan was not accepted.
3. Decision of the District Court. The Company
brought this suit in December, 1930, attacking the findings of theCommission as to both rate base and return.
The Company alleged that the fair value of its gas prolm
erties exceeded $95,000,000, that its gross and net reve-'
nues were overestimated by the dommission, that under
the rates prescribed the Company would have earned, for
the twelve months ending October 31, 1930, but 4.25 per
cent. upon the fair value which it claimed, and that the
temporary optional rates, for which the' Commission's
order provided, would also yield less than a fair return
and were equally invalid. Upon the motion for interlocutory injunction, the entire record before the Commission was received in evidence together witl4 additional
affidavits,, and upon the same evidence the parties submitted the cause for final determination.
While the District Court did not make specific findings
of values, revenue, expense and rate of return, the Court
reviewed the findings of the Commission and the evidence
and held that. the Commission's valuationsk were reasonable and that the prescribed rates permitted a reasonable
return. Two opinions were delivered, one for the majority of the Court and a concurring opinion by the Circuit
Judge, in which the contentions of the Company were
examined.
Considering the growth and stable position of the Company, the Court pointed out that "with a history of successful and profitable business, and no real competition
to meet in its field of service, the hazard is small and -the
probabilities of continued demand assured. Electricity
has not to any great extent supplanted gas as a fuel. All
of the conditions noted, as affecting the business of the

Company, sustained the Commission in its statement that
the plaintiff's securities are capable of be:ag marketed at
moderate interest rates, and that it will continue to
grow." 58 F. (2d) p. 259. The Court found that the
Commission "was very liberal in its treatment of certain
items of property"; that "since 1924" the Company
has served natural gas, "which is plentiful in the numerous oil fields in southern California "; that "there is no
evidence which destroys the Commission's conclusion that
the supply of natural gas will be abundant and constant "; that the Commission had found in effect that
"at least two of the artificial gas manufacturing plants"
were no longer needed and might well be retired; that
nevertheless the Commission had included them in its valuation "as a live necessary part of the operative property "; and that, had these plants been eliminated, "the
fair value base would have been reduced by approximately
$3,000,000." Id.
In the evidence produced on the application for interlocutory injunction was an affidavit of the Commission's
engineer who brought the valuation of the Company's
properties down to December 15, 1930, by applying the
unit prices prevailing on that date. This witness, Mr.
Dufour, who had been employed from 1915 to 1921 by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, and from that time
had served with the California Commission, stated that
"he kept in close touch Wmith the prevailing labor and
material costs," maintaining as part of the Valuation
division of the Commission a cost bureau for that purpose;
that "the present [December, 1930] tr6nd of material and
labor cost is downward; due to the present acute unemployment situation the wages paid the class of labor required for this type of construction is now lower and due
to the large number of applicants for employment from
which capable men may be selected the efficiency of labor
is higher, tending to materially decrease the labor costs ";

289 U.S.

that he estimated "that the current price level cost of
plaintiff's gas properties used and useful in the public
service applying prices prevailing December 15, 1930, including land market value as of December 31, 1929, and
excluding difficulty factor,'" is $60,009,099, undepreciated "; that this amount would represent the cost of the
properties as they existed December 31, 1929, if the unit
costs and prices prevailing on December 15, 1930, were
used, applying overhead charges of six per cent." The
Company's expert witness, in replying to this affidavit,
gave his opinion that "the variations in price levels during the year 1930 do not constitute a permanent change
in price levels and prices will for a reasonable period in
'the future be on a higher level than existed on December
15, 1930, and will, on the average over the next few years,
approximate the prices used by him in his estimate of
labor cost new reflected in the value of $95,767,351 shown
in the affidavit filed herein on December 23, 1930."
Summing up its conclusions as to the action of the
Commission, the Court said: "What the Commission did
then in reaching its base rate figure of fair value was
to include all items of property used and useful in the
operative plant of the plaintiff, and appraise the value
thereof at current market prices. It included original
organization costs and franchise values as well. It assumed a live active plant, and affirmed that the ultimate total included all costs of attaching business as the
same had accrued and been accounted for. Its fair value

items hereinafter referred to, was one which essentially
represented the investment cost, at the present time, of
all the operative property and its connected, incidentals."
58 F. (2d) p. 260. The Court regarded the ruling of the
Commission in taking overheads in accordance with the
Company's accounting practice as reasonable. The Court
held that "the large amounts claimed by the Company
for cost of financing, $5,921,470; promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000; cost of attaching business (going concern value), $9,228,667; added 'difficulty' costs, $580,195, were properly rejected as for their total amounts."
Id, p. 262.
The Court observed that the matter of accrued depreciation, which had not been deducted from the fair value
base as used by the Commission, was important as affecting the annuity allowance to be considered in arriving
at prospective income. The amount allowed by the Commission as depreciation annuity was $1,072,00, while the
Company claimed that it should be not less than $2,344,744. The Court noted the inconsistency of this claim,
when the Company asserted tht the total accrued depreciation affecting its property was only $3,470,326.
The Court concluded that the allowances for depreciation
annuities which had been made prior to the rate hearing under review were excessive and were not controlling;
that depreciation was a matter not capable of definite
ascertainment and that it had not been shown that the
Commission had not exercised a reasonable judgment.
Id., p. 261.
With respect to estimated income for the future, the
Court referred to the Company's complaint that the two
preceding years had been marked by unusually high temperatures and consequent diminished demand for gas,
and that "it was improper to assume average temperatures." But the Court, familiar with conditions ini Los

Angeles, thought that the practice adopted by the Commission was fair, adding: "We may note that the winter
of 1931-32 in the city of Los Angeles, as it has thus far
progressed at the end of January, has been one of the
coldest in many years. And so, the rule of assumed average temperatures seems to be the only reasonable one to
adopt. During unusually mild winters the utility service
will earn less than was estimated to be allowed to it,
and in colder winters will earn more." Id., p. 262.
The action of the Commission was also approved with
respect to the allowances for materials and supplies and
for working capital.
In the final decree the Court set forth its finding" that
the values for plaintiff's property as fixed and determined
by the defendant Railroad Commission are the reasonable values thereof; that the rates fixed are such as to
render a reasonable return on such values and that said
rates are therefore not confiscatory," and the Court
adopted, " as representing its further findings," the opinion filed by the two District Judges. The Circuit Judge
concurred in the decree, referring to his concurring opinion for the findings of fact upon which. his action was
based.
4. We approach the decision of the particular questions
thus presented in the light of the general principles this
Court has frequently declared. We have emphasized the
distinctive function of the Court. We do not sit as a
board of revision, but to enforce constitutional rights.
San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, 189 U.S. 439, 446.
The legislative discretion implied in. the rate making
.power necessarily extends to the entire legislative process,
embracing the method used in reaching the legislative determination as well as that determination itself. We are
not concerned with either, so long as constitutional limitations are not transgressed. When the legislative method
is disclosed, it may have a definite bearing upon the valid-

ity of the result reached, but the judicial function does
not go beyond the decision of the constitutional question.'

That question is whether the rates as fixed are confiscatory. And upon that question the complainant has the
burden of proof and the Court may not interfere with the
exercise of the State's authority unless confiscation is
clearly established.
As the, property remains in the ownership of the complainant, the question is whether the complainant has
been deprived of a fair return for the service rendered to
the public in the use of the property. This Court has repeatedly" held that the basis of calculation is the fair
value of the property, that is, that what the complainant
is entitled to demand, in order that it may have "just
compensation," is "a fair return upon the reasonable
value of the property at the time it is being used for the
public." " In determining that basis, the criteria at hand
for ascertaining market value, or what is called exchange
value, are not commonly available. The property is not
ordinarily the subject of barter and sale and, when rates
themselves are in dispute, earnings produced by rates 'do
not afford a standard for decision. The value of the property, or rate base, must be determined under these inescapable limitations. And mindful of its distinctive function in the enforcement of constitutional rights, the Court
has refused to be bound by any artificial rule or formula
which changed conditions might* upset.. We have said

that the judicial ascertainment of value for the purpose
of deciding whether rates are confiscatory "is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a -easonable judgment
having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant
facts." MinnesotaRate Cases, 230 U.S. 352, 434; Georgia
Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, 262 U.S.
625, 630; Bluefield Water Works Co. 'v. Public Service
Commission, 262' U.S. 679, 690.
The actual cost of the property-the investment the
owners have made-is a relevant fact. Smyth v. Ames,
169 U.S. 466, 547. But while cost must be considered,
the Court has held that it is not an exclusive or final test.
The public have not underwritten the investment. The
property, on any admissible standard of present value,
may be worth more or less than it actually cost. The
time and circumstances of the outlay, and the effect of
altered conditions demand consideration. Even when
cost is revised so as to reflect what may be deemed to have
been invested prudently and in good faith, the investment
may embrace property no longer used and useful for the
public. This is strikingly illustrated in the present case,
where the Company has a large gas manufacturing plant
which, in view of the supply of natural gas, has not been
used for several years and is not likely to be used for
many years to come, if at all. But no one would question
that the reasonable cost of- an efficient public utility system "is good evidence of its value at the time of construction." We have said that "such actual cost will
continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as
there is no change in the level of applicable prices." McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U.S. 400, 411.
And when such a change in the price-level has occurred,
actual experience in the construction and development of
the property, especially experience in a recent period, may
be an important check upon extravagant estimates.

Opinion of the Court.

This Court has further declared that, in order to determine present value, the cost of 'reproducing the. property is atelevant fact which should have appropriate consideration. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public
Service Commission, 262 U.S. 276, 287, 288; Bluefield
Water Works v. Public Service Commission, supra;
Standard Oil Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 268 U.S. 146,
156; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, p. 410.
In Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service
Commission, supra, this Court said that " itis imipossible
to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the
investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values, made upon a view of all
the relevant circumstances, is essenfial. If the highly
important element of present costs is wholly disregarded,
such a forecast becomes impossible." See St. Louis &
O'FallonRy. Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. .461, 485. But
again, the Court has not decided that the cost of reproduction furnishes an exclusive test. See Smyth v. Ames,
supra; Minnesota Rate Cases, supra; Georgia Railway
& Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra. We have
emphasized the danger in resting conclusions upon estimates of a conjecitural character. We said, in Minnesota
Rate Cases, supra, p. 452,--" The cost-of-reproduction
method is of service in ascertaining the present value of
the plant, when it is reasonably applied and when the
cost of reproducing the property may be ascertained with
a proper degree of certainty. But it does not justify the
acceptance of results which depend upon mere conjecture.
It is fundamental that the judicial power to declare legislative action invalid upon constitutional grounds is to be
exercised only in clear cases. The constitutional invalidity must be manifest and if it rests upon disputol qti(,stions of fact, the invalidating facts mnust be provu. And

this is true of asserted value as of other facts.", The
weight to be given to actual cost, to historical cost, and to
cost of reproduction new, is to be determined in the light
of the facts of the particular case. McCardle v. Indian,.
apolis Water Co., eupra.
5. In determining the weight, to be ascribed in the instant case to historical cost as shown by the evidence,
the outstanding fadt is that the development of the property had, for the most part, taken place in a recent period.
We agree with the Court below that no ground, is shown
for assailing the valuation -placed upon the Company's
property by the Commission in 1917, in its first decision
(13 C.R.C., p. 724) and which appears to have been accepted by the Company as a starting point in later rate
investigations. See 16 C.R.C., p. 481 (1919); 20 C.R.C.,
p. 96 (1921). The rate base fixed in 1917 was approximately $13,000,000. From that, time the cost of additions and betterments was under congtant supervision and
was established by the Company's records under the accounting regulations of the Commission. From 1917 to
1919 there was but little change, the Company's estimate
of capital, and the rate base as fixed by the Commission,
for 1919, being under $14,000,000. 16 C.R.C., pp. 481,
482. Thus the additions and betterments which brought
the historical cost of the fixed property (with land at current values) up to $58,842,187, as found by the Commission at the end of 1929, took place in the ten preceding
years and approximately two-thirds of the latter, amount
appears fo have been the cost of additions and betterments after January .1, 1922, as the rate base taken at that
time was approximately $20,000,000. 20 C.R.C., pp. 97,
98. We have had occasion to take judicial notice of the
high level of prices of labor and materials prevailing not,
only from 1917, as incident to the war, but also in 1922
and 1923 and that there was no "substantial general de-

,cline" in such prices from that time to 1926.12

See Lin-

coln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U.S. 256, 268; Galveston
Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U.S. 388,402; McCardle v.
Indianapolis Water Co., supra, p. 412. During these
year the historical cost of the .Compapys fixed property
increased by additions and betterments to over $52,000,000. 29 C.R.C., p. 181. There can be rio question that
the cost of additions and betterments from 1926-in the
period just preceding the Commission's order under review-was good evidence of their value at that time.
And, so far as prices of labor and materials are concerned,
we find no warrant for a conclusion that there had been
any change in levels during the years that intervened
from the first valuation in 1917 which made it unfair to
the Company, in fixing rates for the. future, to take the
historical cost as found by the Commission as evidence of
the value of the 'Company's structural property !at the
time of the rate order. On the contrary, it clearly appears
that, by reason of the downward trend, the prices for labor
and materials, which were reflected in that historical cost
were higher than those which obtained during the later
period to which the prescribed rates apply.
We noted at the outset that there is a difference between
the parties with respect )to the amount whii should be
taken as historical cost. The Company contends that in
entering additions and betterments in its books it charged
too little to capital account for overheads) and it'dire'cts
attention to the opinion of the Commission's engineers
that 11.25 per cent. of direct labor and material items could
reasonably have been charged to capital for indirect construction costs instead of 6 per cent., the amount actually
charged. The difference is over $2,000,000. With an
allowance of 11.25 per cent. for overheads, the Comm'ssion's engineers estimated the historical cost, of fixed

289 U.S.

property at $61,019,662 instead of $58,842,187, allowed
by the Commission. It is unnecessary to review the
contentions upon this point, as if the valuation were
made at the higher figure, while it would exceed the.
$60,704,000 found by the Commission as historical cost,
it would still be under the amount of $65,500,000 which
the Commission took, on the basis of fair value, as an
undepreciated rate base.
6. Coming to cost of reproduction, we agree with the
Court below that the items included in the Company's
estimate for "cost of financing, $5,921,470," and "promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000," were too conjectural
to be allowed. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young,
287 U.S. 488, 500. Aside from these items, and that of
going value to which we shall presently refer, the Company's estimate of cost of reproduction new of the fixed
property, without deduction for depreciation, was $77,586,700, which included $831,781 for organization and
franchises, leaving for the physieal property $76i754,919.
While, this estimate was described as of January 1, 1930,
it was stated to be based, not on spot prices of that date,
but upon prices which were "close to the average" of
the prevailing prices for the preceding three years. That
is; the estimate rests on prices prevailing from 1927 to
1929, inclusive. In making this calculation; overheads
were taken at 24.27 per cent. The estimate made by the
Commission's engineer of reproduction cost new, without
depreciation, which most closely corresponds to the above
estimate of the Company, was $73,637,542, including
$427,406 for organization and franchises, leaving $73,210,136 for the physical property. This estimate Was of,
December 31, 1929, but was based on four-year average
unit prices for the years 1926 to 1929, and overheads were
figured at 22.32 per cent.
In both of these estimates the gas manufacturing plant
was included without any deduction for disuse. The sum

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 311
287

Opinion of the Court.

of $12,134,665 was included in the Company's estimate as
the cost of reproducing this plant. Whatever may be
said of the propriety of, including this entire plant in a
valuation based on historical cost, in the light of prudent
investment, we perceive no reason for embracing unnecessary facilities in an estimate of cost of reproduction. In
a new construction under, present conditions it does not
appear that such an extensive manufacturing plant would
be established, and the finding of the District Court is
amply sustained that if the manufacturing facilities no
longer needed had been eliminated, the fair value base
,would have been reduced by about $3,000,000. With that
deduction, the estimate of the Commission's engineer
would, be about $70,000,000, without allowance for
depreciation.
We find it unnecessary, however, to consider the details
of these estimates, for there is a fundamental objection to
their acceptance as a basis for a finding of confiscation.
The determination of present value is not an end in itself.
Its purpose is to afford ground for prediction as to the
future. It is to makepossible an "intelligent forecast of,
probable future values" in order that the validity of rates
for the future may be determined. " Estimates for tomorrow," the Court has said, "cannot ignore prices of
to-day." Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public
Service Commission, supra; Bluefield Water Works v.
Public Service Commission,. supra, p. 691; St. Louis &
O'FallonRy. Co. v. United States, supra. But we know
that the estimates of present value, taken as the cost of
reproduction as of December 31, 1929, based upon average prices from 1926 or 1927 to 1929, furnished no dependable criterion of values in the succeeding years. The
country was facing a most serious decline in prices. It
was entering upon a period of such depression as to constitute "a new experience to the present generation."

It was not the usual case of possible fluctuating conditions
but of a changed economic level. Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 248, 260, 262.
That an important change was in progress was shown by
the evidence submitted on the application for interlocutory injunction in January, 1931, to which we have already referred. The Commission's witness then 'called
attention to the downward trend of prices, estimating the
cost of the property on the basis of prices prevailing Deceriber 15, 1930, and taking overhead at 6 per cent., at
$60,009,099 as against $64,082,282 as of December 31,
1929, and $63,399,822 as of June 15, 1930. See supra,
p. 6. The mistaken outlook of the Company's expert witness is disclosed by his affidavit in reply, supporting his
former estimate, that, in his opinion, prices for the immediate future, and "for several years to come," would be
"on the average higher than the present level and approximately at the 1929 level." It is apparent that the
estimates of cost of reproduction new of 1929, or of 1930,
upon which the Company relies, afforded no secure foundation for prediction of future values, and the rate base
as fixed by the Commission is not to be invalidated as
involving confiscation by reason of these estimates which
the course of events deprived of crcdit as trustworthy
prophecies.
7. No ground appears for challenging the finding of
the Commission, made upon -inspection and appraisal,
that the accrued depreciation of the property amounted
to $7,650,000. While not admitting the accuracy of the
finding, the Company does not undertake to contest it
here, but takes the amount as the maximum which can
be allowed upon the evidence. In determining present
value, deduction must be made for accrued depreciation.
Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U.S. 1, 10; Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, pp. 457, 458. But the Commis-

Opinion of the Court.,

sion made its calculation of the Company's -return, under
the rates prescribed, upon the rate base it fixed, undepreciated.
8. As an item additional to the estimates of value thus
far considered, the Company claims to be entitled to an
allowance of $9,228,667 for "going value." This Court
has declared it to be self-evident "that there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant,
doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced," and that this element of value is "a property
right" which should be considered "in determining the
value of the property upon which the owner has a right
to make a fair return." Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des
Moines, 238 U.S. 153, 165; Denver v. Denver Union
Water Co., 246 U.S. 178, 191, 192; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, p. 414. The going value thus
recognized is not to be confused with good will, in the
sense of that "element of value which inheres in the
fixed and favorable consideration of customers, arising
from an established, and well-known and well-conducted
business," which, as the Court has repeatedly said, is
not to be considered in determining whether rates fixed
for public service corporations are confiscatory, Des
Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, supra. See Willcox v.
Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U.S. 19, 52; Cedar Rapids
Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 223 U.S. 655, 669; Galveston
Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, p. 396. Nor does this
recognition of going value countenance a mere attempt to
recoup past losses. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston,
supra, pp. 394, 395. Deficits in the past do not afford a
legal basis for invalidating rates, otherwise compensatory, any more than past profits can be used to sustain
confiscatory rates for the future. Board of Commissioners
v. New York Telephone Co., 271 U.S. 23, 31, 32. The

just exercise of the regulatory power in fixing rates, and,
on the other hand, that authority is not entitled to treat
a living organism as nothing more than bare bones.
The principle as thus recognized and limited is obviously
difficult of application. Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar
Rapids, supra. It does not give license to mere speculation; it calls for consideration of the history and circum-'
stances of the particular enterprise, and attempts at precise definition have been avoided. It.is necessary again,
in this relation, to distinguish between the legislative and
judicial functions. It is the appropriate task of the Commission to determine the value of the property affected
by the rates it, fixes, as that of an integrated, operating
enterprise, and it is the function of the Court in deciding
whether rates are confiscatory not to lay down a formula,
much less to prescribe an arbitrary. allowance, but to
examine the result of, the legislative action in order to
determine whether its total effect is to deny to the owner
df the property a fair return for its use.
Thus, in Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, supra,
this Court noted that, in the decision under review, the
fact "that the plant was in successful operation" had
expressly been taken into account and that a value had
been fixed which "considerably exceeded its cost," and
hence the court found no warrant for changing the result. In Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, supra, the
Court, dealing with the Master's report and the exclusion of a special item for going value, observed that the
Master, "applying the rule of the Cedar Rapids case,"
had "already valued the property in the estimate of what
he called its physical value, upon the basis of a plant in
actual and successful operation." As the Master had
included overheads at 15 per cent. in that valuation, in
addition to organization expenses, the Court was unable
to hold that "the element of going value" had not been
given the consideration it deserved. In Denver v. Den-

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 315
287

Opinion of the Court.

ver Union Water Co., supra, the Court, premising that
"each case must be controlled by its own circumstances,"
pointed out that the Master had "expressly declared that
his detailed valuation of the physical property and water
rights included no increment because the' property constituted an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money," and that an examination of his
elaborate report convinced the Court that this was true.
And in that case the Court found that the return allowed
by the ordinance in question was clearly confiscatory.
In Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, supra, pp. 267, 268, the
Court questioned the propriety of the Master's treatment
of going value, but noting compensatory errors in favor
of the complainant could not conclude that the Master
was wrong in holding that the ordinance was not shown
to be confiscatory. In Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, the Court took occasion to say that the expressions in the Denver case and in the Lincoln case were
not to be taken as modifying in any respect the rule
declared in the Des Moines case as to the exclusion of
good will. In Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad
Commission, supra, the finding below as to going value
was not disturbed. In Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission,supra, while ten per cent. had been
added for going value, the total result was a valuation
which could not be sustained. In McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, where the rates were held to be
confiscatory, the Court found that the evidence was
"more than sufficient to sustain 9.5 per cent. for going
value" and that the Commission's engineer had made no
appraisal of that element.

In the light of these decisions, our inquiry must be,
first, as to the actual scope and effect of the legislative
determination in relation to the value of the property as
that of an integrated and established 'enterprise, and,
second, whether the evidence requires the conclusion that

316

by reason of the inadequacy of the Vyluation the result is
confiscation. As to the first question, it is urged that the
Commission declined to' allow any amount for going
value. It is true that the Commission, refusing to admit
the assumptions underlying the' Company's claim for the
amount of $9,228,667 as going value, stated that it did
allow "for the so-called, intangible going concern Value
by treating its cost as a current operating- expense." But
we cannot fail to give effect to the fact that the Comminission, determining its rate base at $65,500,000 for 1930; on
the basis of fair value, stated that (apart from deduction
for accrued depreciation) this amount was " the fair value
of the property here involved as a going property with
business attached, giving full effect to-the durreni level of
prices and allowing for any intangible elements of value
not fully cared for in the usual and current operating expense." And the District Court, in its majority opinion,
kconcluded that "this rate base figure of fair value" included "original organization costs and franchise values
as well," and "assumed a, live active plant and affirmed
that the ultimate total included all costs of attaching
business as the same had accrued and been accounted
for."
Vhat the Commission did was to take the historical cost of the plant, calculated on the same basis as to
cost of additions and betterments as that used in the several previous rate proceedings, and this amount, together
'with the sums allowed for materials and supplies, and for
working capital, with the additional allowance for interest, with the amount assigned to organization expenses
and franchises, and with land at current values, made up
a total "historical cost" of $60,704,000. To that total,
the Commission added $4,796,000 in reaching its fair
value figure, or rate base, of $65,500,000. Included in
that rate base was approximately $10,500,000 as the cost
of the gas manufacturing plant, or about $3,000,000 which,
as'the District Court found, represented facilities no longer

LOS ANGELES- GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 317
287

Opinion of the Court.

needed. Eliminating the latter amount, the margin in
the rate base, as taken at fair value, over historical cost,
was about $7,796,000. If allowance be made for increased
overheads, by taking.them at 11.25 per cent. in figuring the
cost of additions and betterments (instead of the 6 per
cent. as allocated to capital by the Company in its books),
the allowance of which the Company urges in the 'light of
the testimony of the Commission's engineers, and if the
difference of $2,177,765 be deducted, there would still
remain $5,618,235 in the rate base over the historical cost
as thus revised. As the historical cost of the far greater
part of the fixed property appears to have been taken at
price levels which were higher than those which have obtained in the period to which the prescribed rates are applicable, and cannot fairly be said. to underestimate the
yalue of the plant as of that period, this excess amoint of
over $5,500,QOO can appropriately be assigned to'elements
of value which may not have been fully covered. The
record affords no adequate basis for criticising the 'allowance made by the Commission for materials and supplies
and working capital, and thus the entiiem excess may be
regarded as applicable to whatever intangible value the
property had as a going concern. The fact thai this margin in the rate base was not described as going value is
unimportant, if the rate base was in fact large enough to
erbrace that element.
The remaining question, then, is whether the Company
has proved, with requisite persuasiveness, a greater
amount for going value than that Which may be treated
as substantially allowed. An examination of the evidence
offered by the Company ,upon this subject shows it to be
of a highly speculative and uncertain character: There
were two witnesses and the grounds of their estimates put
their results in a strong light. The Company's valuation
expert, Mr. Luick, gave three methods which he had used
as guides in the forming of his judgment as to going

318

Opinion of the Court.

289 U.S.

value. The first method was "gross revenue," which the
witness used on the basis of his experience " that a purchaser will ordinarily and reasonably pay for a property
with established earnings, and on a stabilized operating
basis approximately one year's gross revenue over and
above the value of physical property." This basis the
witness said would indicate a going value of $15,801,208.21
"based on revenues for the year ended December 31,
1929." His second method was to take a percentage of
the physical property, the witness stating that in his
opinion a purchaser "would pay approximately 15 per
cent. above the cost of reproduction because of the going
value of a property so developed." This percentage produced a total of $10,638,005. The third method he called
the "consumer method" which was based on a cost of not.
less than $25 per meter and gave an aggregate of $8,886,700. The witness said thathe had also given consideration to the fact that the Company had "an exceptionally
good history of growth, an esta'blished business, with
satisfactory record of earnings and excellent future prospects." The witness alluded to the growth of Los Angeles
and adjoining communities, and considering all these factors estimated the going value as of January 1, 1930, at
$10,000,000.
The other witness, Mr. Miller, took Mr. Luick's construction program, in which the latter had figured the cost
of reproduction, and had assumed that there would be
turned over to the operating department "one-twentieth
of the service mains during each quarter of the second to
sixth years inclusive." Estimating year by year the cost
of securing the business during the construction period,
the witness took the difference between 8 per cent. interest on the property used and useful during the year and
the net earnings estimated to have been received, and the
total of these differences with interest, during the period
assumed to be required, was taken to represent the cost of

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N. 319
287

Opinion of the Court.

securing the present business of the Company. This was
thus calculated to amount, ,from the second through the
seventh year inclusive, to $8,721,878. To this sum the
witness added as the estimated cost "of organizing property and personnel,," $506,789, thus reaching the total of
$9,228,667 which the Company claims as going value.
It is unnecessary to analyze the testimony of these witnesses, as it is obviously too conjectural to justify us in
treating the failure to include their estimates as a sufficient basis for a finding of confiscation.
Our conclusion is that the Company has failed to sustain its attack upon the rate base of $65,500,000.
9. The Commission calculated that the Company would
have a return of 7 per cent. on this rate base. We said in
Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, pp. 692, 693, that a"' public utility is entitled
to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value
of the property which it employs for the convenience of
the public equal to that generally being made at the same
time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks an. -uncertainties; but it
has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized
or anticipated in highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures." We added that the return " should be
reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial
soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under
efficient and economical management, to maintain and
support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for. the proper discharge of its public duties." And
we recognized that "a rate of return may be reasonable
at one time and become too high or too low by changes
affecting opportunities for investment, the money market
and business conditions generally." See Smith v. Illinois
Bell Telephone Co., 282 U.S. 133, 160, 161. Applying
these principles, and considering the financial history of

the Company,"8 its relations and opportunities, and the
general situation as to investments, we find it impossible
to hold that a return of 7 per cent. is so low as to be confiscatory. Wabash Electric Co. v. Young, sqpra, p. 502.
The question, then, is as to the estimates of revenue and
expenses. The Company complains that the Commission's estimate of revenue was too high. The problem
largely concerns temperatures, and it is plain that the
Commission was justified, in fixing rates which were to
apply for a considerable period, in taking average temperatures. The District Court, with its special knowledge of
local conditions, and speaking in April, 1932, held that
the action of the Commission was fair. The Circuit Judge
supplemented this finding of the majority by his holding
that there was "nothing unreasonable in the estimate of
returns by tlie Commission so far as temperature is concerned " and that there was "nothing to indicate that due
consideration was notgiven to the possible effect of the
depression upon the consumption of, gas." 58 F. (2d)
262, 286.
The controversy as to estimate of expenses turns on the
sufficiency of the depreciation annuity allowed by the
Commission. The company claimed $2,344,000 (or,
$2,306,606) as against the Commission's allowance of
$1,072,000. But it is not clearly shown that what the
Commission allowed will not be adequate protection for
the purpose in view, and there is no basis for concludingthat the Commission's practice under which the Company
has accumulated a large depreciation reserve has resulted in injustice to the Company. 1' The fact that
the property represented by the Company's depreciation reserve could not be used to support the imposition of a confiscatory rate did not make it necessary for
the Commission to make an annual allowance which in

the light of experience would be excessive. Smith v.
Illinois Bell Telephone Co., supra,p. 158. The Commission was entitled to form its judgment, and the three
judges in the court below were agreed in the view that
the discretion of the Commission in this regard had not
been unreasonably exercised. We see no reason to disturb this conclusion.
The few minor questions which remain do not require

case.
MR. JUsTIcE BUTLER, dissenting.

This is an important case. The amount at stake is
great, and the principles involved are more important.
The reduction made by the commission when prescribing
what it found to be reasonable rates, October, 1928, is not
definitely shown. But the amount by which the rate of
return was reduced indicates a probable reduction by more
than a million per year. The net reduction made in November, 1930, by the order undel- consideration is more
than one million per year. That is enough to yield a return of seven per cent. on over $14,000,000. There is also
involved more than $2,500,000 now held by the comp-any
subject to claims of customers that it be refunded to them
if the order shall be sustained.
The commission, following theories that admittedly
are contrary to our decisions in confiscation cases, refused
to ascertain or to consider the value of the property.' It

report (35 C.R.C. 443) in this case states (p. 445): "This

made the last reduction upon mere cost figures. Its." fair
value" figure is higher than its " historical cost." The
fund basis, a return somewhat in excess of the cost of the money invested in the property." And Commissioner Decoto said (p. 474): "For
thirty-two years the Supreme Court of the United States has consistently adhered to the controlling principles of valuation' laid down by
it. In spite of the fact that the pathway is now made reasonably clear
by the decisions of the courts, some state commissions seem to be
inclined to be a law unto themselves and persist in ignoring the law as
laid down by the courts. The California Commission has to all outward appearance been one of these. It has clung ostensibly and
theoretically to the historical rate base. In reality it has given effect
to the different elements mentioned by the federal courts including
fair value including going value by allowing a rate return between
8 per cent. and 81/2 per cent. on historical cost if there be added to the
historical rate base an amount between 10 per cent. and 121/2 per cent.,
the rate base so obtained will approximate fair value including going
value. So, also ifthere is deducted from 10 per cent. to 12% per cent.
from a rate of return of 8 per cent. or 81/2 per cent. on an historical cost
rate base, it is readily seen that there is an actual return varying from
7 per cent. to 7.75 per cent. upon fair value including therein a reasonable amount for going value. With this arrangement our public
utilities have been content. During the last two years this commission has shown a tendency to cut the rate return upon an historical
rate base from between 8 per cent. and 8% per cent. to 7 per cent.,
which reduced the rate of return upon a fair value base to 6.12 1/ per
cent. and 6.3 per cent. This is confiscation and not regulation."
The president of the commission, October 21, 1931, in an address
before the National Association of Railroad and Public Utilities Commissiofners apparently in opposition to constitutional law as established
by numerous decisions here, said: "It is safe to say that in practically
none, if any of the cases in which there have been permanent injunctive orders issued.by the federal courts, would actual confiscationhave
followed the Commission findings. This is stated not only from general -knowledge of the facts but from specific knowledge of the
experience in California. A study'of the court opinions indicates beyond reasonable dtubt that in practically every major rate case in the
last seventeen years in that state the findings of the Commission
could not have withstood the test imposed by the federal tribunals."

commission based that increase on its finding that unit
prices properly applicable to the prescribing of reasonable
rates for the future are higher than were those actually
paid throughout the years for the construction of the
property. This increase amounted to $4,796,000 and it
was found correct by the district court and also in the
concurring opinion below. But this court excludes it and'
holds to original cost. The amount involved in that item
alone is more than enough to require reversal.
The commission excluded from overhead expenditures
actually made by the company the difference between six
per cent. and 11.25 per cent. upon the ground that the company charged such difference to operating expenses and
not to capital. It refused to give any consideration to the
findings of its own engineer that in a proper estimate of
the cost of reproduction as of the date of the inquiry such
overheads would exceed 22 per cent. The company's estimate was about 24 per cent. Each of these rulings is directly contrary to our decisions. Board of Comm'rs v.
N. Y. Tel. Co., 271 U.S. 23, 31; S. TV. Tel. Co' v. Pub.
Serv. Comm'n, 262 U.S. 276, 287; Ohio Utilities Co. v.
Commission, 267 U.S. 359, 362; McCardle v. Indianapolis
Water Co., 272 U.S. 400, 408-410; St. L. & O'Fallon Ry.
Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 461, 484-485. The district
court followed the commission. This court in accordance
with law settled by its own decisions, repudiates that
method of treating overheads and adopts 11.25 per cent..
It refuses, as did the commission and the lower court, to
give any weight to admitted reproduction cost in respect
of overhead expenditures.
The valuation by the commission was based; upon an
inventory agreed to be correct by the plaintiff and commission. It included two standby plants to which the
commission attributed $3,000;000. The district court
adopted that figure. It declared, 58 F. (2d) 259, that

289 U.S.

the commission included these plants as a "live, necessary part of the operative property." 2 But this court
excludes the item. Three million so thrown out is sufficient
to require reversal. It was for the commission to decide
whether these plants are required properly to safeguard
the public service. This court should hesitate long before'
holding they are not. Seven per cent. on three million
dollars so eliminated is $210,000, about 58 cents on each
of' the 385,000 meters, a small charge to insure readiness
to serve.
The commission refused to consider or allow anything
for going value., Plaintiff's gas properties adequately
serve a great and, before the present depression,' a rapidly
growing demand. If permitted to charge reasonable
rates, or those merely high enough to be non-confiscatory,
plaintiff will continue to be able to earn an ample rate of
return upon the value of the property. Its charges for
gas are low in comparison with those generally collected
for like service. The record shows that, having regard to
the effective thermal units in the natural gas that plaintiff
has been furnishing in recent years, its rates are less than
one-half those formerly collected by it. And, in absence
of contrary showing and finding, its charges must be
deemed to have been considered just and reasonable by
the regulatory authorities of the, State and by the public.
'The court's statement follows: "The commission was very liberal
in its treatment of certain. items of property. The company. in its
early operations furnished artificial gas. Since 1924 it -has served
natural gas, which is plentiful in the numerous oil fields in Southern
California. There is no evidence which discredits the commission's
conclusion that the supply of natural gas will be abundant and constant. The commission found in effect that at least two of the artificial gas manufacturing plants of plaintiff were no longer needed and
might well be retired. Nevertheless, it included them in its valuation
as a live necessary part of the operative property. It appears that,
had these plants been eliminated, the fair value base would have been
reduced by approximately $3,000,000." 58 F. (2d) 256, 259.

BUTLER,

J., dissenting.

Unquestionably, and the opinion of this court so implies,
millions should be added to the cost figures applicable to
the physical items in order. to find the value of plaintiff's
property, the amount protected by the Constitution. The
ground on which the commission excluded going 'value
was that the cost of attaching the business was charged
to operating expenses. The district court followed the
commission. That being contrary to law, this court repudiates the rulings of both and uses over $5,500,000 as
going value. Its calculations to reach value produce a
figure substantially the same as the commission's "fair
value" cost figure. But that was attained by the application of formula, a thing repeatedly condemned here.
Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U.S. 35 ? 434; Bluefield
Water Works Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 262 U.S. 679,
690; McCardle v. IndianapolisWater Co., 272 U.S. supra,
410.
This Court's conclusion--depending upon mere coincidences-that value is the same as the "fair value" cost
figures found by the commission is without support. The
figure used to cover going value was arrived at" upon considerations that have no relation to the amount that in
any view reasonably may be assigned to that element.
It comes about thus: Add $3,000,000 (made available by
excluding the standby plants found necessary by the commission and included by the district court) to $4,796,000
(obtained by reversing the findings of commission and
accepted by the lower court in respect of unit prices). A
part of that total is used to neutralize the errors in law
committed by the commission and the lower court in respect of overheads. Enough is taken to increase that
item from 6 per cent. to 11.25 per cent. And the calculated
balance, $5,618,235, is assigned to going value. That figure certainly is not the result of an appraisal or valuation
of plaintiff's going value. Neither the amount attributed
to the standby plants eliminated by this court nor the

326

289 U.S.

commission's addition to original cost to get its "fair
value " figure has any relation to going value. When in
confiscation cases any going value exists, the amount
justly attributable thereto must be ascertained and included. See, e.g., National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas
City, 62 Fed. 853, 865; Omaha v. Omaha Water Co.,
218 U.S. 180, 202; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238

People ex rel. Kings County L. Co. v. Willcox, 210 N.Y.
479, 486; 104 N.E. 911.
The rates should be set aside because arrived at by
arbitrary methods condemned by our decisions.
The State, by the exertion of legislative power, established the rule that public utility rates, including those
charged for gas, shall be just and reasonable. It is powerless to enforce, and therefore must be presumed to have
intended that its commission should not attempt to prescribe, confiscatory rates. The commission's field of action is within reasonable limits above the point or line
where confiscation would commence. Banton v. Belt Line
Ry., 268 U.S. 413, 422-423. In ascertaining the return
protected by the Constitution, the commission is required
to take into account and make proper allowances for the
actual original, and the estimated present, cost of the
property, including overheads. It is bound to include a
just and reasonable amount to cover going value. The
amount omitted in respect of each of these items is large
enough to invalidate rates based on the valuation. There
is no warrant for inquiry by this court to ascertain whether
under the evidence the valuation of the property might
otherwise have been pared down to the figure used by the
commission nnd adopted by the district court. It is definitely settled by our decisions that where public utility
rates, prescribed by a state commission as reasonable, are

LOS ANGELES GAS CO. v. R.R. COMM'N.

J., dissenting.

attacked as confiscatory, the courts may inquire into the
method by which the commission's conclusion was reached
and that, if such rates are based upon property valuation
or other essential fact that was arbitrarily arrived at or
that is without, support in the evidence, such rates will be
set aside. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Dept. Public Works,
268 U.S. 39, 42-45; Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Pub.
Util. Comm'n, 274 U.S. 344, 351; St. L. & O'Fallon Ry.

The lower court's decree and opinion taken together
may not reasonably be construed to comply with Equity
Rule 701/2. In confiscation cases, the rule should be
strictly enforced. The trial court should make a definite
and complete statement of the facts on which it rests its
judgment. Cf. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, 275 U.S.
440, 447. In a number of cases decided in recent years
specially constituted district courts failed to make definite
findings or to give reasons upon which they grounded
their decrees. This court repeatedly and emphatically
reminded them of the proper practice and required that
it be followed. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272

quired to be heard before three judges, the court 'of first
instance shall find the facts specially and state separately
its conclusions of law thereon; and its findings and conclusions shall be entered of record and, if an appeal is
taken from the decree, shall be included by the clerk in
the record which is certified to the appellate court under
rules 75 and 76."
The command that the trial court "shall find the facts
specially" means at least that the statement shall be
definite, concise and complete ag distinguished from discursive, argumentative, obscure or fragmentary. Tax
Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, 533. The direction
"and state separately its conclusions of law thereon"
shows that discussion of facts and law in, the course of
explanation, reasoning or opinion to clarify or support the
conclusion or judgment reached, is not sufficient. The
opinion filed in this case as a concurring one appears on
its face to have been prepared for adoption by and as
the opinion of the court. It was not accepted by either
of the other judges; in any event that opinion could not
be considered a compliance with the rule. v The rule was
intended to make unnecessary, analysis or extended examination for the ascertainment of the facts and propositions
of law on which rest decrees of the courts of first instance.
The opinion of the majority does not purport to "find
the facts specially" or to "state separately its conclusions of law thereon."
The decree is not a compliance with the rule. "The
court now finds that the values for plaintiff's property as
fixed and determined by the defendant Railroad Commission are the reasonable values thereof; that the rates
fixed are such as to render a reasonable return on such
values and that said rates are therefore not confiscatory.
And the court adopts, as representing its further findings,
the opinion filed herein on April 8, 1932, as concurred in

and decision hereof." This is within the condemnation
of our decisions. Railroad Commission v. Maxcy, supra;
Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra; Public Service
Comm'n v. Northern Indiana Co., supra.
Public Service Comm'n v., Wisconsin Tel. Co., supra,
decided after the argument of this case, is of special
interest. The commission appealed from an interlocutory decree declaring that enforcement of telephone rates
prescribed by the commission would result in confiscation
of the company's property. The district court filed no
opinion and made no special findings of fact. The conipany moved to affirm. The commission's contention was
that the decree should be reversed for lack of specification
of the facts on which it rested. The company maintained
that the decree was abundantly sustained by the facts
shown in the record. We held that Rule 701/2 does not
apply to decisions on applications for temporary injunctions and made it clear that the duty of the court in passing on such applications was not altered by the adoption
of the rule. We said (ante, p. 70): "While an application for an interlocutory injunction does not involve a
final determination of the merits, it does involve the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. That discretion can
be exercised only upon a determination, in the light of the
issues and of the facts presented, whether the complainant
has made, or has failed to make, such a showing of the
gravity of his complaint as to warrant interlocutory relief. Thus, if the issue is confiscation, the complainant
must make a factual showing of the probable confiscatory
effect of the statute or order with such clarity and persuasiveness as to demonstrate the propriety in the interest
of justice, and in order to prevent irreparable injury, of
restraining the State's action until hearing upon the merits can be had. . . . the court should make the findings
of fact and conclusions of law that are appropriate to the
interlocutory proceeding." And we refused, even when

aided by adequate brief and argument of counsel, to consider whether the temporary injunction was warranted
by the facts shown in the record. We vacated the decree
with costs against the utility and remanded the case for
findings and conclusions appropriate to a decision upon
the application for an interlocutory injunction. And it
is the purpose of this court to promulgate a rule definitely
requiring district courts to make special findings of fact
in such cases.
The reasons for the enforcement of such a rule are
stronger where final judgment is entered. The work done
for the court by the writer of the opinion should not be
undertaken here. Our rules do not permit adequate opportunity for presentation of such cases as upon trial
de novo. Nor is the time that the Justices can give to
preparation for and in our conferences sufficient to enable
them to reach reasonable conclusions in respect of the
bases or details of calculations, revisions and determinations reflected by the elaborate opinion in this case.
We should follow Public Service Comm'n v. Wisconsin
Tel. Co., vacate the decree and remand the case for special
findings. The district court should appoint a special master to hear the parties, m.,ke specific findings of fact, and
state separately his conclusions of law and recommendation
fordistrict
a decree.
The
court should have referred the case to a
special master for such a report. Experience has made it
plain that rate confiscation cases are intricate in respect
of facts and involve complicated, grave and difficult questions that are impossible of adequate examination by a
court without the assistance of a master. Dubourg de
St; Colombe's Heirs v. United States, 7 Pet. 625. The report of the commission in this case occupies 54 pages of
the record and the opinions of the participating judges
extend through more than 71 pages. That the burden
of mere analysis, comparison or concordance is very great

can be gathered from the opinion of this court. The lack
of definite findings in respect of essential facts is obvious
and it is likely that, if the district court had undertaken
separately to state its conclusions of law, it would not
have fallen into the errors sought to be corrected by the
opinion here. Its decision was not announced until more
than nine months after final submission of the case. This
statement implies no adverse criticism, for it is often difficult for the judges, consistently with performance of their
other duties, to give the time required for travel, full
hearings, adequate conferences in advance,of decision and
for preparation of draft opinions. The requirement that
three judges shall participate undoubtedly increases the
need for a special master.
Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Tompkins, 176 U.S. 167,
was a confiscation case involving the validity of statemade railroad rates. The trial judge, without the aid of
a master, examined the pleadings and proof, made findings
of fact, stated his conclusions of law, delivered an opinion
and rendered a decree dismissing the bill. But he failed
to find an essential fact, the cost of doing local business.
This court remanded the case with instructions to refer
it to a competent master. Speaking through Mr. Justice
Brewer, it said (p. 179): "The question then arises what
disposition of the case shall this court make. Ought we
to examine the testimony, find the facts, and from those
facts, deduce the proper conclusion? It would doubtless
be within the competency of this court on an appeal in
equity to do this, but we are constrained to think that it
would not (particularly in a case like the present) be the
proper course to pursue. This is an appellate court, and
parties have a right to a determination of the facts in the
first instance by the trial court. Doubtless if such determination is challenged on appeal it becomes our duty to
examine the testimony and see if it sustains the findings,
but if the facts found are not challenged by either party

then this court need not go beyond its ordinary appellate
duty of considering whether such facts justified the decree.
We think this is one of those cases in which it is especially
important that there should ,bea full and clear finding of
the facts by the trial court. The questions are difficult,
the interests are vast, and therefore the, aid of. the trial
oourt should be had. The writer of this opinion appreciates the difficulties which, attend, a trial court in a case
like this. In Smyth.v. Ames, supra, a'similar case, he, as
'Circuit Judge presiding in the Circuit Court of Nebraska,
ndertook the work of examining the testimony, making
computations, and finding the facts'. It was very laborious, and took several weeks. It was a work which really
ought 'to have been done by a master . .. We are all of
opinion that a betterpractice is to refer the testimony to
some competent master,. to make all needed computations,
and find fully the fads. It.is hardly necessary to'observe
that in view of the difficulties and importance of such a
case it is imperative that the most competent and reliable
master, general or special, should be.selected, for it is not
a light-matter to interfere with the legislation of a State in
respect to the prescribing of rates, nor a light matter to
permit such .legislation to wreck large property interests."
Li~icoln Gas'Co. v. Lincoln, 223 U.S: 349, involved the
validity of, a city ordinance regulating 'charges for -gas.
"thecourt elow fdiled t.o make findings of fact in respect
of the suh13 annually roquired for depreciation and replacements. This court, speaking through Mr. Justice
Lurton, said (p. 361): "The -cause should have gone at
the beginning to a skilled master, upon whose report specific errors could have been assigned and a ruling from the
court obtained." The case was remanded to the district
•court with instructions to refer it to a competent master
i*ith directions to report fully his findings upon all questions raised by either party, and 'with leave to both parties
to take additional evidence.

While the practice since Chicago,M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v.
Tompkins has not been uniform, special masters have been
appointed quite generally.'
To summarize:
1. There is no warrant for reversal here of the commission and district court in respect of unit prices upon which
they built up their "fair value" figure. If business conditions since the commission made its order are deemed

to affect that figure, we should remand with directions to
the district court to find the facts. Atchison, T. & S. F.

2. This court should not undertake to ascertain the
amount of overheads properly to be included. But, if
that matter is to be considered here, the 22 per cent. included in the commission's reproduction estimate and the
company's 24 per cent. should not be ignored but should
be considered in connection with the 11.25 per cent. in'Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 2i2 U.S. 1; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 2i2 U.S. 19, 24; Louisville v. Cumberland Tel. & Tel.

relevant facts.
3. There is no warrant for this court's elimination frcm
the agreed inventory of standby plants which were included by the commission and district court.
4. There has been no appraisal of going value. That
element was arbitrarily excluded below. There is no
rational foundation for the amount attributed to it here.
5. As the commission's refusal to apply principles of
valuation established by our decisions resulted in arbitrary undervaluations, the prescribed rates should on
that ground be set aside.
.6. The decree appealed from should be vacated and the
case remanded for compliance with Rule 70 .
7. The district court should refer the case to a special
