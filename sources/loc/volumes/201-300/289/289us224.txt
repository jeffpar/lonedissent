should have the unrestricted benefit of the inventions in
such a case, I think that the appropriate remedy would be
to cancel the patents.

officer of a Federal Reserve Bank, or of any member bank, to make

delivered the opinion of the

Court.

Opinion of the Court.

ber 26, 1918, c. 177, § 7, 40 Stat. 972; 12 U.S: Code,
§ 592.1
An indictment in sixteen counts charges the appellee,
John G. Darby, with a violation of this statute. Eight
entries are alleged to have been falsely made. Each has
relation to a separate promissory note discounted by the
Montgomery County National Bank of Rockville, Maryland. The notes bore the genuine signature of J. G.
Darby as maker. They bore *hat appeared to be the
signature of Bessie D. Darby as co-maker or endorser.
In fact, as the appellee well knew, her signature was a
forgery. With this knowledge he entered in the discount
book the name of Bessie D. Darby as co-maker or endorser, anddid this in the course of his employment as
assistant cashier. The odd numbered counts charge an
intent to injure and defraud the bank, and the even numbered counts an intent to deceive the officers of the bank
and the Comptroller of the Currency. A demurrer to
the indictment was sustained by the District Court on
the ground that the discount of the paper had been recorded as it occurred, and hence that the entries were not
false within the meaning of the statute. The case is here
'Sec. 5209. Any officer, director, agent, or employee of any Federal reserve bank, or of any member bank ...

who ...

makes any

false entry in any book, report, or statement of such Federal reserve
bank or member bank, with intent in any case to injure or defraud
such Federal reserve bank or member bank, or any other company,
body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to. deceive any
officer of such Federal reserve bank or member bank, or the Comptroller of the Currency, or any agent or examiner appointed to examine the affairs of such Federal reserve bank or member bank, or the
Federal Reserve Board; ...

shall be deemed guilty of a misde-

meanor, and upon conviction thereof in any district court of the
United States shall be fined not more than $5,000' or shall be imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, in the discretion of the
court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

289 U.S,

under the Criminal Appeals Act (Act. of March 2, 1907,
c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246; .18 U.S. Code, § 682; cf. Judicial
Code, § 238; 28 U.S. Code, § 345) upon an appeal by the
Government.
"The crime of making false entries by an officer of a
national bank with the intent to defraud . . . includes
any entry on the books of the bank which is intentionally
made to represent what is not true or does not exist, with
the intent either to deceive its officers or to defraud the
association." Agnew v. United States, 165 U.S. 36, 52.
The act charged to the appellee is criminal if subjected to
that test. At the time of the entry, no note was in existence with the signature of Bessie D. Darby as co-maker
or endorser. No note with such a signature had been discounted by the bank. The forged signature was a nullity,
as much so as if the name had been blotted out before the
discount, or never placed upon the notes at all. Verity
was not imparted to the entry by the simulacrum of a, signature known to be spurious. Agnew v. United States,
supra; Coffin v. United States, 162 U.S. 664, 683; United
States v. Morse, 161 Fed. 429, 436; Morse v. United States,
174 Fed. 539, 552; United States v. Warn, 295 Fed. 328,
330; Billingsley v. United States, 178 Fed. 653, 659, 662;
Peters v. United States, 94 Fed. 127, 144. As well might
it be said that dollars known to be counterfeit might have
been entered in the books as cash.
To read the statute otherwise is to be forgetful of its
aim. Its aim was to give assurance that uion an inspection of a bank, public officers and others would diseove'r
in its books of account a picture of its true condition.
United States v. Corbett, 215 U.S. 233, 241, 242; Billingsley v. United States, supra. One will not find the picture
here. Upon the face of the books there was a statement
to examiners that paper with two signatures had been
discounted by the bank. and was then in its possession.

BUFFUM v. BARCELOUX CO.
Syllabus.

224

In truth, to the knowledge of the maker of the entries,
there were not two signatures, but one.
Nothing at war with our conclusion was said, much less
decided, in Coffin v. United States, 156 U.S. 432, 462. The
opinion in that case is to be read in the light of a later
opinion in the same case (162 U.S. 664), and of the still
later opinion in Agnew v. United States, supra. Whether

the conclusion would be the same if the signature had
been genuine, but the signer had been known to be an insolvent, or a man of straw (cf. Cooper v. United States,
13 F. (2d) 16; Morse v. United States, supra; United
States v. Warn, supra,Billingsley v. United States, supra),
there is no occasion to determine. Our decision does not
go beyond the limits of the case before us.
The judgment should be reversed and the case remanded
to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance
Reversed.

BARCELOUX CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 564.

Argued March 20, 21, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933

1. Where a pledge, followed by a secret and unfair sale to the pledgee
fcr much less than value, was part of a general scheme of the
parties to defraud the pledgor's creditors; the remedy of his trustee in bankruptcy is not merely to set aside the sale and have a
new one ordered, but to set aside the pledge and recover the
property or its value. Bankruptcy Act, § 70 (e). P. 232.
2. Even though one of the creditors of a bankrupt, by accepting a
Sjunior lien, may have estopped himself from attacking a pledge
made by the bankrupt in fraud of creditors, this does not prevent
the Trustee from setting it aside under J 70 (e); and recovery
will be for the benefit of all the creditors. Moore v. Bay, 284

U.S. 4. P. 233.
