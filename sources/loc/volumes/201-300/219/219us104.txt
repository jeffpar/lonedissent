Territory of Arizona was within the power of Congress.
The principle of the cases is declared to be by Mr.
Justice Matthews, in Ewell v. Daggs, supra, "that the
right of a defendant to avoid his contract is given to him
by statute, for purposes of its own, and not because it
affects the merits of his obligation, and that whatever the
statute gives, under such circumstances, as long as it
remains in fieri, and not realized by having passed into a
completed transaction, may, by a subsequent statute, be
taken away. It is a privilege that belongs to the remedy
and forms no element in the rights that inhere in the contract." And such view of curative statutes is entertained
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, as indicated by
its opiniQn in the present case and the cases there cited.
The Federal question having been correctly decided,
the judgment is
Affirmed.
NOBLE STATE BANK v. HASKELL.'
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.
No. 71.

Argued December 7, 8, 1910.-Decided January 3, 1911..

The chafter of a corporation which is subject to the usual reserved
powers to alter or repeal is not impaired unless the subsequent
statute deprives it of property without due process of law.
The broad words of the Fourteenth Amendment are not to be pushed
to a drily logical extreme, and the courts will be slow to strike down
as unconstitutional legislation of the States enacted under the police
power.
Where the mutual advantage is a sufficient compensation, an ulterior
public advantage may justify a comparatively insignificant taking
of private property for what in its immediate purpose is a-private use.
The police power extends to all the great public needs, Canfield v.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a proceeding against the Governor of the State
of Oklahoma and other officials who constitute the State
Banking Board, to prevent them from levying and collecting an assessment from the plaintiff under an act approved December 17, 1907. This act creates the Board
and directs it to levy upon every bank existing under the
laws of the State an assessment of one per cent of the
bank's average'daily deposits, with certain deductions, for
the purpose of creating a Depositors' Guaranty Fund.
There are provisos for keeping up the fund, and by an act
passed March 11, 1909, since the suit was begun, the assessment is to be five per cent. The purpose of the fund is
shown by its name. It is to secure the full repayment of
deposits. When a bank becomes insolvent and goes into
the hands of the Bank Commissioner, if its cash immediately available is not enough to pay depositors in full, the
Banking Board is to draw from the Depositors' Guaranty
Fund (and from additional assessments if required) the
amount needed to make up the deficiency. A lien is reserved upon the assets of the failing bank to make good the
sum thus taken from the fund. The plaintiff says that it is
solvent and does not want the help of. the Guaranty Fund,
and that it cannot be called upon to contribute toward securing or paying the depositors in other banks consistently
with Article I, § 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. The petition was
dismissed on demurrer by the Supreme Court of the State.

The'reference to Article I, § 10, does not strengthen the

plaintiff's bill. The only contract that it relies Upon is its
charter. That is subject to alteration or repeal, as usual,
so that the obligation hardly could be said to be impaired
by the act of 1907 before us, unless that statute deprives
the plaintiff of liberty or property without due process of
law. See Sherman v. Smith, 1 Black, 587. Whether it
does so or not is the only question ir4 the case.
In answering that question we must be cautious about
pressing the broad words of the Fourteenth Amendmeit
to a drily logical extreme. Many laws which it would be
vain to ask the court to overthrow could be shown, easily
enough, to transgress a scholastic interpretation of one or
another of the great guarantees in the Bill of Rights.
They more or less limit the liberty of the individual or they
diminish property to a certain extent. We have few
scientifically certain :criteria of legislation, and as it often
is difficult to mark the line where what is called the police
power of the States is limited by the Constitution of the
United States, judges should be slow to read into the latter
a nolumus mutare as against the law-making power.
The substance of the plaintiff's argument is that the
assessment takes private property for private use without
compensation. And while we should assume that the
plaintiff would retain a reversionary interest in its contribution to the fund so as to be entitled .to a return of
what remained of it if the purpose were given up (see
Receiver of Danby Bank v. State Treasurer, 39 Vermont,
92. 98), still there is no denying that by this law a portion
of its property might be taken without return to pay debts
of a failing rival in business. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the logical form of the objection, there are more powerful considerations on the other side. 'In the first place it
is established by a series of cases that an ulterior public
advantage may justify a comparatively insignificant taking ot private property for what, in its immediate purpose,
is a private use. Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S. 361. Strickley

v. Highland Boy Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527,.531. Offield v.
New York, New Haven & HartfordR. R. Co., 203 U. S. 372.
Bacon y. Walker, 204 U. S. 311, 315. Cjnd in the next,
it would seem that there may be other cases beside the
every day one of taxation, in which the share of each party
in the benefit of a scheme of mutual protection is sufficient compensation for the correlative burden that it is
compelled to assume. See Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, 177
U. S. 190. At least, if we have a case within the reasonable exercise of the police power as above explained, no
more need be said.
It may be said in a general way that the police power
extends to all the great public needs. Camfield v. United
States, 167 U. S. 518. It may be put forth in aid of what is
sanctioned by usage, or held by the prevailing morality or
strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and immediately necessary to the public welfare. Among matters of that sort probably few would doubt that both usage
and preponderant opinion give their sanction to enforcing
the primary conditions of successful commerce. One of
those conditions at the present time is the possibility of
payment by checks drawn against bank deposits, to such
an extent do checks replace currency in daily business.
If then the legislature of the State thinks that the public
welfare requires the measure under consideration, analogy
and principle are in favor of the power to enact it. Even
the primary object of the required assessment is not a
private benefit as it was in the cases above cited of a ditch
for irrigation or a railway to a mine, but it is to make the
currency of checks secure, and by the same stroke to make
safe, the almost compulsory resort of depositors to banks
as the only available means for keeping money on hand.
The priority of claim given to depositors is incidental to
the same object and is justified in the same way. The
power to restrict liberty by fixing a minimum of capital
required of those who would engage in banking is not

denied. The power to restrict investments to securities
regarded as relatively, safe seems equally plain. It has
been held, we do not doubt rightly, that inspections may
be required and the cost thrown on the bank. See Charlotte, Columbia & Augusta R. R. Co. v. Gibbes, 142 U. S.
386. The power to compel, beforehand, 'co6peration, and
thus, it is believed, to make a failure unlikely and a general
panic almost impossible, must be recognized, if government is to do its proper work, unless we can say that the
means have no reasonable relation to the end. Gundling
v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183, 188. So'far is that from being
the case that the device is a familiar oie.. It wasadopted
by some States the better part of a cen tury ago, and seems
never to have been questioned until now. Receiver of
Danby Bank v. State Treasurer,39 Vermont, 92. People v.
Walker, 17 N. Y. 502. Recent cases going not less far are
Lemieux v. Young, 211 U. S. 489, 496. Kidd, Dater and"
Price Co. v. Musselman Grocei. Co., 217 U. S. 461.
It is asked whether the State could require all corporations or all grocers to help to guarantee each other's
solvency, and where we are going to draw the line. But
the last is a futile question, and we will answer the others
when they arise. With regard to the police power, as
elsewhere in the law, lines are pricked out by the gradual
approach and. contact of decisions on the opposing sides.
Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S. 349, 355.
It will serve as a datum on this side, that in our opinion the
statute before us is well within the State's constitutional
power, while the use of tlie pviblic"credit on a large scale to
help individuals in business has been held to be beyond
the line. Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655.
Lowell v. Boston, 111 Massachusetts, 454.
' The question that we have' decided is not much helped
by propounding the further one,: whether the right to cn,
gage in banking is or can be made a franchise. But as the
latter question has some bearing on the former and as it

Opinion of the Court.

will have to be considered in the following cases, if not
here, we will dispose of it now. It is not answered by citing authorities for the existence of the right at common
law. There are many things that a man might do at
common law that the States may forbid. He might embezzle until a statute cut down his liberty. We cannot say
that the public interests to which we have adverted, and
others, are not sufficient to warrant the State in taking the
whole business of banking under its control. On the contrary we are of opinion'that it may go on from regulation
to prohibition except upon such conditions as it may prescribe. . In short, when the Oklahoma legislature declares
by implication that free banking is a public danger, and
that incorporation, inspection and the above-described cooperation are necessary safeguards, this court certainly
cannot say that it is wrong. North Dakota v. Woodmansee,
1 N. Dak. 246. Brady v. Mattern, 125 Iowa, 158. Wed

Manhattan Bank, 20 Ohio, 283, 302. Attorney General v.
Utica Insurance Co., 2 Johns. Ch. 371, 377. Some further
details might be mentioned, but we deem them unnecessary. Of. course objections under the state constitution
are not open here.
