UNITED STATES v. CHAMBERLIN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 77.

Argued December 16, 1910.-Decided January 3, 1911.

An action lies by the United States to recover the amount of a stamp
tax upon execution of a conveyance, payable under the War Revenue
Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 470, and the penalties
provided in such act for non-compliance therewith are not exclusive
of collection of the amount by suit.
'A tax may or may not be a debt under a particular statute according
to the sense in which the word is found to be used. But whether
the Government may recover a personal judgment for a tax depends
upon the existence of the duty to pay for the enforcement Of which
another remedy has not been made exclusive.
Whether an action for debt is maintainable depends not upon who is
plaintiff, or how the obligation was incurred, but the action lies
wherever there is due a sum either certain or readily reduced to certainty. Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 542.
Nothing in the nature of a stamp tax negatives per se, either the personal obligation to purchase and affix the stamps or the collection
of the amount by action; nor do provisions for penalties necessarily
exclude personal liability.
Penalties may be provided to induce payment of the tax, and not as a
substitute for such payment, and it will not be presumed that Congress intends by penalizing delinquency to deprive the Government
of suitable means of enforcing the collection of revenue.

the United States for the District of Colorado, against
the executors of the estate of Winfield Scott Stratton, de-

ceased, to recover the amount of stamp taxes claimed to
be payable under the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898.
The plaintiff alleged that in May, 1899, Stratton had
conveyed to a corporation known as Stratton's Independence, Limited, certain lands in the State of Colorado
by deed reciting a consideration of $4,850,000; that internal revenue stamps of the Value of $4,850 were affixed
to the deed, whereas the actual consideration of the conveyance and the value of the lands was $9,733,000, and
by reason thereof there became due and payable to the
United States from Stratton a revenue tax amounting to
$9,733, of which the sum of $4,883 remained unpaid, in-.

ternal revenue stamps therefor not having been attached
to the deed or canceled; that the Collector of Internal
Revenue of the United States for the District of Colorado
had reported the facts to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, who had determined that the sum of $9,733
should have been paid, and demand for payment having
been made and refused the said Commissioner had directed suit to be instituted.
The District Court sustained a general demurrer to
the complaint and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
The applicable provisions of the War Revenue Act of
June 13, 1898, chapter 448, (30 Stat., pp..448-470; R. S.

The War Revenue Act did- not, either expressly or by
implication, forbid the collection by this action of these
delinquent stamp taxes due under it. The pinitive provisions of the act are not in any sense remedies to make
the Governiment whole for its loss of revenue. These
penalties, even if remedies at all, were imposed not for
failure to pay the tax but for failure to affix the stamps.
It was not the intention of Congress, in making the
punitive provisions under this particular act, to renounce
the right to collect the tax; or to offer to the person taxed
an alternative choice of penalty or tax. The rule of construction as to exclusive remedies is not applied as against

The repeal of the requirements of the act that deeds
should be stamped, did not abate the penalty prescribed
for a violation thereof. The Government is -no more
remediless since the repeal than it was before. Sackett v.
McCaffrey, 131 Fed. Rep. 219.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The question presented is whether an action ties by
the United States to recover the amount of a stamp tax
payable under the War Revenue Act of 1898 upon the
execution of a conveyance.
If the statute creates an obligation to pay the tax, and
does not provide an exclusive remedy, the action must be
regarded as well brought.
At common law, customs duties were recoverable by
the Crown by an information in debt or an exchequer
information in the nature of a bill in equity for discovery
and account. These informations rested upon the: general principle "'that in the given case the common law or
the statute creates a debt, charge, or duty in the party
personally to pay the duties immediately upon the importation; and that, therefore, the ordinary remedies lie
for this, as for any other acknowledged debt due :to the
crown." United States v. Lyman, 1 Mason, p. 499. See
also Comyn's Digest (Title "Debt," A, 9); Bunbury's
Reports, *pp. 97, 223, 225, 262.
Applying this. principle it was held in the Lyman case,
supra, and in Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, that
the Government was entitled to maintain an action to recover dutibs upon imports as a personal indebtedness of
the importers. The duty to pay was there derived from
the language of the act of April 27, 1816, c. 107 (3 Stat.,
p. 310), that "there shall be levied, collected and paid"
the several duties mentioned, and in accordance with an

UNITED STATES v. CHAMBERLIN.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

established rule of interpretation the charge of the duty
on the goods was taken to mean a personal charge against
the owner. In the case last cited the court by Mr. Justice Story said (p. 493):
"The first question is, whether Smith and Buchanan
were ever personally indebted for these duties; or, in
other words, whether the importers of goods do, in virtue
of the importation thereof, become personally indebted
to the United States for the duties due thereon; or the
remedy of the United States is exclusively confined to the
lien on the goods, and the security of the bond given for
the duties. It appears to us clear upon principle, as well
as upon the obvious import of the provisions of the various acts of Congress on this subject, that the duties due
upon all goods imported constitute a personal debt due
to the United States from the importer (and the consignee
for this purpose is treated as the owner .and importer),
independently of any lien on the goods, and any bond
given for the duties. The language of the duty act of the
27th of April, 1816, ch. 107, under which the present importations were made, declares that 'there shall be levied,
collected, and paid' the several duties prescribed by the
act on goods imported into the United States. And this
is a common formulary in other acts laying duties. Now,
in the exposition of statutes laying duties, it has been a
common rule of interpretation derived from the principles of the common law, that where the duty is charged
on the goods, the meaning is that it is a personal charge
on the owner by reason of the goods. So it was held in
Attorney General v.
-,
2 Anst. R. 558, where a duty
was laid on wash in a still; and it was said by the court
that where duties are charged on any articles in a revenue
act, the word 'charged' means that the owner shall be
debited with the sum; and that this rule prevailed even
When the article was actually lost or destroyed before it
became available to the owner. Nor is there anything

OCTOBER TERM,. 1910.

219 U. S.

new in this doctrine; for it has long been held that in all
such cases an action of debt lies in favor of the government against the importer, for the duties, whenever by
accident, inistake, or fraud, no duties, or short duties have
been paid."
A similar rule has been applied in the case of internal
revenue taxes. United States v, Washington Mills, by
Clifford, J., 2 Cliff. 601, 607; Dollar Savings Bank v.
United States, 19 Wall. 227; United States v. Pacific Railroad, by Miller and Dillon, JJ., 4 Dill. 66; United States v.
Tilden, by Blatchford, J., 9 Ben. 368.
In Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, supra, an action of debt was sustained to recover the amount of the
internal revenue tax imposed by the act of July 13, 1866,
c. 184, 14 Stat. 138, on the undistributed gains carried to
the surplus fund of the bank. It was objected that the
act provided a special remedy for the assessment and collection of the tax and that no other could be used. But
the court, finding no prohibition of the remedy by action,
held the argument untenable, saying (pp. 238-240):
"It must also be- conceded to be a rule of the common
law in England, as. it is in Pennsylvania and many of the
other States, that where a statute creates a right and provides a particular remedy for its enforcement, the remedy
is generally exclusive of all common-law remedies.
"But it is important to notice upon what the rule is
founded. The reason of the rule is that the statute, by
providing a particular remedy, manifests an intention to
prohibit other remedies, and the rule, therefore, rests
upon a presumed statutory prohibition. It applies and
it is enforced when ,any one to whom the statute is a rule
of conduct seeks redress for a civil Wrong. He is confined
to the remedy pointed out in the statute, for he is forbidden to'make use of any other. But by the Internal
Revenue law, the United States are not prohibited from
adopting any remedies for the recovery of a debt due

UNITED STATES v. CHAMBERLIN.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to them which are known to the laws of Pennsylvania.
The prohibitions, if any, either express or implied, contained in the enactment of 1866, are for others, not for
the government. They may be obligatory upon tax collectors. They may prevent any suit at law by such officers or agents. But they are not rules for the conduct
of the State. It is a familiar principle that the King is
not bound by any act of Parliament unless he be named
therein by special and particular words. The most general words that can be devised (for example, any person
or persons, bodies politic or corporate) affect not him in
the least, if they may tend to restrain or diminish any
of his rights and interests. He may even take the benefit of any particular act, though not named. The rule
thus settled respecting the British Crown is equally applicable to this government, and it has been applied frequently in the different States, and practically in the Federal courts. It may'be considered as settled that so much
of the royal prerogatives as belonged to the King in his
capacity of parens patriw, or universal trustee, enters as
much into our political state as it does into the principles
of the British constitution.
"It must, then, be concluded that the government is
not prohibited by anything contained in the act of 1866
from employing any common-law remedy for the collection of its dues. The reason of the rule which denies
to others the use of any other than the statutory remedy
is wanting, therefore, in applicability to the government,
and the ,rule itself must not be extended beyond its reason." See also United States v. Stevenson, 215 U. S. p. 197.
The statute, in the Savings Bank case, contained a provision (now in ยง 3213, Rev. Stat.) which expressly authorized the bringing of an action. But the court also found a
sufficient basis or 'its judgment in the general power of the
Government to collect by suit taxes that are due, where
the statute imposing the'tax does not deny that remedy.

This point was presented, considered and decided in the
determination of the cause and the decision is none the
less authoritative because there was another ground for
the ultimate conclusion. Railroad Co. v. Schutte, 103
U. S. p. 143; Union Pacific Co. v. Mason City Co., 199
U. S. p. 166.
Neither Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, nor Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, relied upon by the defendants, involved the question. In the former case it was
held that the acts of Congress of 1862 and 1863, making
United States notes a legal tender for debts, had no reference to taxes imposed by state authority. The Legal
Tender Acts expressly provided that the notes should
be receivable for national taxes and the context forbade
the:-conclusion that Congress intended to include state
taxes under the term "debts," and there was hence no
conflict with the statute of Oregon which required the
taxes due the State to be collected in coin.
In Meriwether v. Garrett, supra, it was held that taxes
levied before the repeal of the charter of a municipality,
other than such as were levied in obedience to the special
requirement of contracts entered into under the authority
of law, and such as were levied under judicial direction
for the payment of judgments recovered against the
city, could not be collected through the instrumentality
of a court of chancery at the instance of the city's creditors. Such taxes could be collected only under authority
from the legislature.
A tax may or may not be a "debt" under a particular
statute, according to the sense in which the word is found
'to be used. But whether the Government may recover
a personal judgment for a tax depends upon the existence
of the duty to pay, for the enforcement of which another
remedy has not been made exclusive. Whether an action
of debt is maintainable depends not upon the question
who is the plaintiff or in what manner the obligation was

UNITED STATES v. CHAMBERLIN.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

incurred, but it lies whenever there is due a sum either
certain or readily reduced to certainty. Stockwell v.
United States, 13 Wall. p. 542.
Here the tax was a stamp tax, but the language as
clearly imports the obligation to pay as did that of the
statute before the court in the Meredith case, supra.
Section 6 of the War Revenue Act of 1898 provided that
there should be "levied, collected and paid" in respect
of the instruments mentioned "by any person or persons,
or party who shall make, sign, or issue the same, or for
whose use or benefit the same shall be made, signed, or
issued, the several taxes or sums of money" set forth

in the schedule which followed. There is nothing in
the nature of a stamp tax which per se negatives either
the personal obligation, otherwise to be derived from the
words imposing the tax, or its collection by action. The
stamp is to be affixed to the instrument "to denote said
tax." Sections 7, 13, 14. Section 25 provided that the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue should cause to be
prepared "for the payment of the taxes prescribed in
this Act suitable stamps denoting the tax on the document, article, or thing to which the same may be affixed."
The stamp is the evidence, and its purchase the convenient means, of payment. When a statute says that 'a
person shall pay a given tax it obviously imposes -upon
that person the duty to pay, and this may be enforced
through the ordinary means adapted to the recovery of a
definite sum due, unless that course is clearly prohibited.
The objection was made in the Satdngs Bank case,.supra,
that the tax had not been assessed. The court held,
however, that no other assessment than that made by
the statute was necessary in order to determine the extent
of the bank's liability. Following this rule, Judge Blatchford said in United States v. Tilden, 9 Ben. p. 386, where
the action was brought to recover unpaid taxes on income: "The extent of the liability of the individual for

income tax is defined by the statute, equally with the
extent of the liability of the bank for the tax on undistributed earnings. In each case it is necessary, in an action of debt for the tax, to resort to sources of information
outside of the statute, to ascertain the amount on which
the per centum of tax fixed by the statute is to be calculated. . . . The difference between the two cases,
in that respect, if there be any, will be, in every case, one
of degree merely, not of principle. The statute in imposing the per centum of tax on the income of the individual,
makes a charge on him of a sum which is certain for the
purposes of an action of debt, because it can be made
certain through the action of a judicial tribunal, by following the rules laid down in the statute. That is the
principle of the decision in the case of the bank, and it
controls the present case ' See also King v. United States,
99 U. S. p. 233; United States v. Erie Railway Co., 107 U. S.
p. 2; United States v. Philadelphia& Reading RailroadCo.,
123 U. S. p. 114; and United States v. Snyder, 149 U. S.
p. 215. The statute now before us fixes a tax of a specified
amount, according to the consideration or value of the
lands conveyed.
It is insisted,- however, that the provision for penalties
excludes the idea of a personal liability. Thus it is made
a misdemeanor to sign or issue one of the described instruments to which a stamp has not been affixed, punishable under ยง 7 by a fine of not more than one hundred
dollars, and not exceeding two hundred dollars under
ยง 10 in the case of a bill or note. And under ยง 13, where
there is intent to evade the law, the offense is punished
"by a fine not exceeding fifty dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, in the discretion
of the court." The unstamped instrument is made inadmissible in evidence (ยงยง 7, 14), is not allowed to be recorded (ยง 15), and by the 'Provision of ยง 13 is to "be
deemed invalid and of no effect."

UNITED STATES v. CHAMBERLIN.

Opinion of the Court.

But these penalties were provided in order to induce
the payment of the tax, and not as a substitute for payment. It cannot be supposed that Congress intended,
by penalizing delinquency, to deprive the Government
of any suitable means of enforcing the collection of revenue. In large transactions, as in the case at bar, the
fine which could be imposed would be much less than the
tax, and no reason is suggested why the Government
should forego the collection of that which, under the statute, is its due. Punishment by imprisonment, under ยง 13,
is imposed only where it can be shown that there was an
"intent to evade the provisions" of the act, and while
this remedy is appropriate in such a case, and is for the
obvious purpose of discouraging evasion, it is without
application where, for any other reason, the tax has not
been paid and thereby the Government has lost its revenue. The provision invalidating the instrument is likewise punitive. The object was not primarily to deprive
instruments of effect, but to insure the discharge of the
obligation to pay; and that obligation would still be undischarged, even though, by reason of the non-payment,
the instrument was deemed invalid.
It is insisted, however, that there is no provision for
the removal of the ban from the instrument in case the
tax were collected by suit and that this shows the intention to bar the latter remedy; for it is said that the purpose could not be to destroy the effect of the instrument
and at the same time to compel the payment of the tax.
This argument proceeds upon a misconception of the
statute. The provision under which unstamped instruments are made invalid is found in ยง 13, which also provides a method of validation on making the prescribed
payment. The portion of this section which imposes the
penalty is of comprehensive scope and must be deemed
to include a conveyance of land, as well as the other instruments within the purview of the statute. While the

language of the first proviso, in its original form, specifically referred to "bonds, debentures, or certificates of
stock or of indebtedness," this was broadened by the
amendment made by the act of March 2, 1901, chapter 806, 31 Stat. 941, so as to embrace "any instrument,
document, or paper of any kind or description whatsoever
mentioned in Schedule A of this Act." This amendment,
in extending an existing opportunity so as expressly to
include all instruments mentioned in the schedule, must
be construed to refer not only to instruments subsequently
executed but to those as well which had been previously
made o issued. No different construction is required by
the language of the statute, the obvious policy of which
was both to supply a measure of relief from the punitive
provision and at the same time to encourage the payment
of the tax. The provisos of the section as amended are
as follows:
"Provided, That hereafter, in all cases where the party
has not affixed to any instrument the stamp required by
law thereon at the time of issuing, selling, or transferring
the said bonds, debentures, or certificates of stock or of
indebtedness, or any instrument, document, or paper of
any kind or description whatsoever mentioned in Schedule A of this Act, and he or they, or any party having-an
interest therein, shall be subsequently desirous of affixing
such stamp to said instrument, or, if said instrument be
"ost, to a copy thereof, he or they shall appear before the
collector of internal revenue of the proper district, who
shall, upon the payment of the price of the proper stamp
required by law, and of a penalty of ten dollars, and,
where the whole amount of the tax denoted by the stamp
required shall exceed the sum of fifty dollars, on payment
also of interest, at the rate of si per centum, on said tax
from the day on which such stamp ought to have been
affixed, affix the proper stamp to such bond, debenture,
certificate of stock or of indebtedness or copy, or instru-

ment, document or paper of any kind or description whatsoever mentioned in Schedule A of this Act, and note
upon the margin thereof the date of his so doing, and
the fact that such penalty has been paid; and the same
shall thereupon be deemed and held to be as valid, to
all intents and purposes, as if stamped when made or
issued: And provided further, That where it shhll appear
to said collector, upon oath or otherwise, to his satisfaction, that any such instrument has not been duly stamped,
at the time of making or issuing the same, by reason of
accident, mistake, inadvertence, or urgent necessity, and
without any willful design to defraud the United States
of the stamp, or to evade or delay the payment thereof,
then and in such case, if such instrument, or, if the origiโขnal be lost, a copy thereof, duly certified by the officer
having charge of any records in which such original is
required to be recorded, or otherwise duly proven to the
satisfaction of the collector, shall, within twelve calendar
months after the making or issuing thereof, be brought
to the said collector of internal revenue to be stamped,
and the stamp tax chargeable thereon shall be paid, it
shall be lawful for the said collector to remit the penalty
aforesaid and to cause such instrument to be duly stamped.
And when the original instrument, or a certified or duly
proven copy thereof, as aforesaid, duly stamped so as to
entitle the same to be recorded, shall be presented to the
clerk, register, recorder, or other officer having charge
of the original record, it shall be lawful for such officer,
upon the payment of the fee legally chargeable for the
recording thereof, to make a new record thereof, or to
note upon the original record the fact that the error or
omission in the stamping of said original instrument has
been corrected pursuant to law; and the original instrument or such certified copy,. or the record thereof, may
be used in all courts and places in the same manner and
with like effect as if the instrument had been originally

stamped: And provided further, That in all cases where
the party has not affixed the stamp required by law upon
any such instrument issued, registered, sold, or transferred at a time when and at a place where no collection
district was established, it shall be lawful for him or them,
or any party having an interest therein, to affix the proper
stamp thereto, or, if the original be lost, to a copy thereof.
J3ut no right acquired in good faith before the stamping
of such instrument, or copy thereof, as herein provided,
if such record be required by law, shall in any manner be
affected by such stamping as aforesaid."
Neither the punitive provision, nor the means thus afforded to escape it through a voluntary payment, indicate an intention to deprive the Government of the right
to compel payment by action. The party may pay the
tax in the first instance or he may subsequently make
payment as the statute provides and thus render the instrument effective. If he is unwilling or fails to avail
himself of this opportunity, why should he be heard to
insist. that because the instrument is made invalid he
should escape payment of what is due the Government?
In the face of 'the express requirement of the statute that
he shall pay the tax there is no basis for the contention
that from the provisions affecting the validity of the instrument should be implied an intent to prohibit the enforcement of the tax by suit.
Further, as the obvious purpose is to validate the
instrument in case the prescribed payment is made, the
satisfaction of a judgment for the recovery of the tax
must be deemed the equivalent of the payment of the
price of the stamps under the provisos above quoted.
Section 3216 of the Revised Statutes provides: "All judgments and moneys recovered or received for taxes, costs,
forfeitures, and penalties, shall be paid to collectors as
internal taxes are required to be paid." If the case is not
one within the second' proviso permitting the remission

Opinion of the Court.

of the penalty, the additional payment of ten dollars will
be required to meet the conditions of the first proviso.
But so far as the tax is concerned, the person liable therefor, on satisfying the judgment, will have the same right
to have the instrument stamped by the collector as though
he had paid the taxes to the officer without suit. Such
a case would present no administrative difficulty in accomplishing the intent of the statute.
We have examined the other statutory provisions to
which our attention has been called in support of the defense, and we find none of controlling significance, or
which taken separately or together detract from the force
of the provision imposing the obligation to pay the tax
and deprive the Government of the remedy here sought.
We are also of opinion that the statute itself provides
that payment may be enforced by action. Section 31
makes "all administrative, special, or stamp provisions
of law, including the laws in relation to the assessment of
taxes, not heretofore specifically repealed," applicable to
the act. Within* "administrative" provisions must be
included those which relate to the collection of the taxes
imposed. For the administration of the statute may well
be taken to embrace all appropriate measures for its enforcement, and there is no substantial reason for assigning to the phrase which is used in the section quoted a
narrower interpretation. It therefore comprehends the
authority conferred by ยง 3213 of the Revised Statutes in
the following words:
"And taxes may be sued for and recovered in the name
of the United States, in any proper form o f action, before
any circuit or district court of the United States for the
district within which the liability to such tax is incurred,
or where the party from whom such tax is due. resides at
the time of the commencement of the said action."
This provision authorizing suit, with the sanction of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Rev. Stat., ยง 3214),

was originally enacted in 1866 (act of July 13, 1866, c. 184;
14 Stat., p. 111) as an amendment of the Internal Revenue act of June 30, 1864, chapter 173 (13 Stat. 239), and
included within its scope the stamp taxes then in force.
It. must be deemed applicable also to the taxes imposed
by the act of 1898.
Upon these grounds we conclude that the United States
was entitled to maintain this action and that the demurrer
should have been overruled. The judgment is therefore

COUNTY, MISSOURI.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 597.

Argued December 13, 14, 1910.-Decided January 9, 1911.

The following fundamental principles are not open to dispute:
The Government created by the Federal Constitution is one of enumerated powers, and cannot by any of its agencies exercise an authority not granted by that instrument either expressly or by necessary implication.
A power may be implied when necessary to give effect to a power
expressly granted.
While the Constitution of the United States and the laws enacted in
pursuance thereof, together with treaties made under the authority
of the United States, constitute the supreme law of the land, a
State may exercise all such governmental authority as is consistent
with its own, and not in conflict with the Federal, Constitution.
The police power of the State, never having been surrendered by it
to the Federal Government, is not granted by or derived from, but
exists independently of, the Federal Constitution.
One of the powers never surrendered by, and therefore remaining
with, the State is to so regulate the relative rights and duties of
all within its jurisdiction as to guard the public morals, safety and
health, as well as to promote the public convenience and the common good.
