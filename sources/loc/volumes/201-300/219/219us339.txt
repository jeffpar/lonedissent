SEXTON, AS TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF
KESSLER*& COMPANY, v. DREYFUS.
SAME v. LLOYD'S BANK, LTD.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COUR'T OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
Nos. 662, 663.

Submitted January 6, 1911.-Decided January 23, 1911.

Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, a secured creditor selling his securities after the filing of the petition must apply the proceeds, other
than interest and dividends accrued since the date of the petition,

first to the liquidation of the debt with interest to the date of the
petition; he cannot first apply such proceeds to interest accrued
since the petition.
A secured creditor of a bankrupt can apply interest and dividends ac-

cruing on the securities after the date of the petition to interest on
the debt accruing after such date.
r1Ae English rule and authorities discussed and approved.
180 Fed. Rep. 979, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Wallace Macfarlane and Mr. George H. Gilman for
appellant:
The bankruptcy law forbids the allowance of interest on
provable debts after the date of the filing of the petition.
Sections 57, 57h, 63; and see corresponding. prQvision, § 19,
law of 1867; Collier on Bankruptcy, 7th ed:, 701.
Interest accruing after petition filed is obviously not a
debt existing at the time of filing, .and so bythe. express
provisions of the act is excluded-from l roof. See offidial
forms Nos.. 31 and 32, for proof of debt.
As long as the secured creditor stays outside the Bankruptcy Act, or as the English court puts it, "sits on his

security," and claims nothing under the bankruptcy law,
he is entitled to the full proceeds of his securities, and
to collect from.them all the interest and principal of his
debt, if he can. Section 67d protects him in these rights.
If the proceeds are sufficient to pay both the principal and
interest of his claim, nothing in the act can be invoked to
restrict such a payment.
When, however, such a secured creditor comes into the
bankruptcy court asking for dividends on an unsatisfied
balance, his claim ceases to be a secured claim at all, and
is really an unsecured claim for the diminished amount.
Coder v. Arts, 152 Fed. Rep. 943 (afterwards ikffirmed
without considering this point in this court in 213 U. S.
223).
The bankruptcy law in fixing the date of the filing of
the petition as the date at which interest shall cease,
seeks to treat all creditors alike. For this purpose, some
date must be selected as the common due date. The present, law adopts the date of filing of the petition. See Ex
parte Bennet, 2 Atk. 527.
In cases of insolvent banks a secured creditor cannot
have interest upon his claim allowed from the assets subsequent to the date of suspension. Chemical Nat. Bank
v. Armstrong, 59 Fed. Rep. 378, 379; Merrillv. Nat. Bank,
173 U. S. 131, 140, 141; White v. Knox, 111 U. S. 784,
787. Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U; S. 28, ,does not apply.
A secured creditor cannot evade the provisions of the
bankruptcy law forbidding the allowance &f interest, accruing subsequent to petition filed, by applying the proceeds of his security first to the payment of interest. In re
Bonacino, 1 Manson, 59.
The 'long established rule of the English courts of bankruptcy forbids the application by.secured creditors of the
proceeds of security to interest accruing after the date of
the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, if such
creditors after the liquidation of the securities claim divi-

The dividends or interest collected on the security subsequent to the date of the receiving order should not be
applied against interest after that date notwithstanding

Mr.Frederic R. Coudert, for appellees in No. 662.
The cases on which appellant relies are certain English
adjudications which are inconsistent, illogical, unsound
and hence non-persuasive. In re Talbott (King v. Chick)
cited in In re Savin, 7 Chan. App. 761.
The French law is similar to the law as laid .down by
the court below. See French Code Civil, § 1254; Code of
Commerce, §_445, and see Credit Agricole C. Syndic Bourson, Cass. Civ. 12, July, 1876, Sirey, Lois et Arrets (1878),
p. 68, and also Soci6t6 Generale C. Synd. Courtignon, Cass.
Civ. 13 July, 1896, Sirey, Lois et Arr6ts (1896), p. 395.
There is no reason why the British rule should prevail
over the cleax cut, symmetrical rule, sanctioned by the
French codes and the highest French tribunal.
Mr. Rufus W. Sprague, Jr., for appellee in No. 663 ;
The Bankruptcy Act expressly recognizes and preserves
valid liens existing at the time of the filing of the petition.
Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U. S.28. Nor does it deny to
a partially secured creditor, the right under its agreement

cruing on the debt after the filing of the petition and up to
and including the time of the sale of the collateral, then to
the principal and to prove for any balance remaining.
Section 63 of the act; Story v. Livingston, 13 Pet. 359, 371;
Merchants' Bank v. Freeman, 15 Hun, 359.
See Coder v. Arts, 213 U. S. 223; In re Stevens, 173 Fed.

231, to effect that if the security is sufficient to pay in full
all interest accruing (subsequent to the filing of the petition
in bankruptcy and up to the time of the sale of the collateral) as well as the principal of the debt, the creditor
would be entitled to retain from the sale of the collateral
an amount sufficient to pay all such interest as well as
the entire principal and would be obligated to turn over
to the trustee only such balance as might remain after
such application of the proceeds from the sale of the security.
•The right of a partially secured creditor to take his interest and prove for the balance due seems to have been
taken for granted in In re Peacock, 178 Fed. Rep. 851;
McHenry v. La Socigtg Francaise, 95 U. S. 58; In re
Strachen, Fed. Case No. 13,519; In re Kallak, 147 Fed.
Rep. 276; In re Scheidt Bros., 177 Fed. Rep. 299.
The Bankruptcy Act provides a remedy if a secured
creditor unreasonably delays in the liquidation of the security held by him. Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U. S.
28, 40; In re Mertens, 144 Fed. Rep. 818.
As to the power of the court under § 57h fixing the value
-of the security, see In re Davison, 179 Fed. Rep. 750;
and to prevent fraudulent exercise of a power of sale of
pledged property by a secured creditor see In re Browne,
104 Fed. Rep. 762.
The delay in selling the security in this case was with
the consent of the trustee, and the English rule has no ap
plication. Ex parte Ramsbottom, 2 Montague & A. 79.

the rule relied upon by appellant, viz.: When the assignee
disputes the security interest is allowed to the claimant.
Ex parte Pollard,1 Mont. D. & D. 264. When there are two
debts, the one provable, the other not, and the security
was given to cover debts in general, the security may be
applied in payment of the debts not provable. Ex parte
Kensington, 2 M. & A. 300, 304. The income of the security earned since the bankruptcy may be set off against
interest on the debt accrued for the same period. Ex parte
Penfold, 4 De Gex & Smale, 282.
MR.JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion ot the court.

In both of these cases secured creditors selling their,
security some time after the filing of'the petition in bankruptcy and finding the proceeds not enough to pay the
whole amount of -their claims, were allowed by the referee
to apply the proceeds first to interest accrued since the
filing of the petition, then to principal, and to prove for
the balance. The referee certified the question whethef
the creditors had a right to the interest. The District
Judge answered the question in the affirmative, giving the
matter a very thorough and persuasive discussion, and
declining to follow the'Eftglish rule. In re Kessler, 171
Fed. Rep. 751. On appeal his decision was affirmed by a
majority of. the Circuit Court of Appeals. 180 Fed. Rep.
979.
The argument certainly is strong. A secured creditor
could apply his security to interest first when the parties
were solvent, Story v. Livingston, 13 Pet. 359, 371, and
liens are not affected by the statute. Section 67d. The
law is not intended to take away any part of the security
that a creditor may have, as it would seem at first sight
to do if the course adopted below were not followed. Some
further countenance to that course is thought to be found
in § 57h, which provides that the value of securities shall

be determined by converting them into money 'according
to the terms of th6 agreement,' for it is urged that by qonstruction the right to apply them to interest is as much
part of the agreement as if it had been written in. Nevertheless it seems to us that on the whole the considerations
o9n the other side are stronger and must prevail.
.For more than a century and a half the theory of the
English bankrupt system has been that everything stops
at, a' certain date. Interest was not computed beyond the
date of the commission. Ex parte Bennet, 2 Atk 527.
This rule was applied to mortgages as well as to un,- oured
debts; Ex parte Wardell, 1787; Ex parte Hercy, 1 92, 1
Cooke,. Bankrupt Laws, 4th ed., 181; (1st ed., App,..ndix),
adP notwithstanding occasional doubts it has been so appli with the prevailing assent of the English judges ever
since. 'Ex parte Badger, 4 Ves. 165. Ex parte Ramsbottom,

downnot because of the words of the statute but as a
fundamental principle. We take our bankruptcy system
from England, and we naturally assume that the fundamental principles upon which it was administered were
adopted by us -when we coied, the system, somewhat as
the established construction of a law gods with the words
where .they are copied by another State. No one doubts
that interest on unsecured debts stops. See § 63 (1).

The .rle is not unreasonable when closely considered.
It simply fixes the moment when the affairs of the bankrupt are supposed to be wound up. If, as in a well known
illustration of Chief Justice Shaw's, Parks v. Boston, 15
Pick. .198,, 208, the whole matter could' be settled in a

Opinion of the Court.

day by a pie-powder court, the secured creditor would be
called upon to sell or have his security valued on the spot,
would receive a dividend upon that footing, would suffer no
intjustice, and could not complain. If, under § 57 of the
present aet, the value of the security should be determined
by Pgreement or arbitration the time for fixing it naturally
woald be the date of the petition. At that moment the
cgle&tore acquire a right in rem against the assets. ChemtL Wonal Bank v. Armstrong, 59 Fed. Rep. 372, 378,
379 Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, 173 U. S.
13t, 140. When there is delay in selling because of the
bope of getting a higher price it is more for the advantage
Gi ft secured creditor than of any one else,. as he takes
the 'Whole advance and the others only benefit by a percentage, which does not seem a good reason for allowing
him to prove for interest by indirection. Whenever the
creditor proves, his security may be cut short. That is the
necessarily possible result of bankruptcy. The rule under
discussion fixes the moment in all cases at the date which
the petition is filed, but beyond the fact of being compelled
to realize his security and look for a new investment there
is no other invasion of the secured, creditor's contract
rights, and that invasion is the same in kind whatever moment may be fixed.
It is suggested that the right of a creditor having security.for two claims, one provable tnd the other unprovable, to marshal his security againsvthe unprovable claim,
(see Hiscock v. Yarick Bank, 206 U. .8 28, 37), is inconsistent with, the rule 6pplied in thiA -ase. But that right is
not affected by fixing a time for winding up, and the
banruptey law does not touch securities otherwise than
in ti isroi
ideIbe particular. The provision in § 57h for
convOt.g securities into money according to the terms
of the agreement has no appreciable bearing on the question. Apart from indicating, in accordance with § 67d,
that liens are not to be affected, it would seem rather to

be intended to secure the right of the trustees and, general
creditors in cases where the security may be wortn more
than the debt. The view that we adopt is well presented
in the late Judge Lowell's work on. Bankruptcy, § 419;
seems to have been entertained in Coder v. Arts, 152 Fed.
Rep. 943, 950, (affirmed without touching this point, 213
U. S. 223), and is somewhat sustained by analogy in the
case of insolvent banks. Merrill v. National Bank 'of
Jacksonville, 173 U. S. 131, 140. White v. Knox, 11 U. S.
784, 787.
Interest and dividends accrued upon some of tho securities after the date of the petition. The English cases
allow these to be applied to the after accruing interst
upon the debt. Ex parte Ramsbdttom, 2 Mont. & Ayrton,
79. Ex parte Penfold, 4 De G. & Sm. 282. Quartermaine's
Case [1892], 1 Ch. 639. There is no more reason for allowing the bankrupt estate to profit by the delay beyond
the day of settlement than there is for letting the creditors
do so. Therefore to apply these subsequent dividends,
&c., to subsequent interest seems just./3
