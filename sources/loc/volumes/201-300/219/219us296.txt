REAVES v. AINSWORTH, MAJOR GENERAL.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TIE .DISTRICT, OF
cOLUMBIA.
No. 14.

Argued December 2, 5, 1910.-Decided January 9, 1911.

Under the act of October 1, 1890, c. 1241, 26 Stat. 562, regulating examinations and promotions in the army, the board of examiners
may mAke a provisional order giving the officer a reasonable period
for reexamination and such an order is .not final but provisional,
and does not deprive the board of jurisdiction to subsequently determine the fitness of officer for duty.
What Isdue process of law depends upon circumstances. To those in
the military or naval service of the United States military law is due
process; and the decision of a military tribunal acting within scope
of its lawful powers cannot be reviewed or set aside by the courts.
The purpose of the act of October 1, 1890, is to secure efficiency and
the only relief from error or injustice in the order of the board is by
review of the President. The courts have no power of review.
Courts are not the only instrumentalities of government; they cannot
command or regulate the army, and the welfare and safety of the
country, through the efficiency of officers of the army, is greater
than the value of his commission, or the right of promotion of any
officer of the army.
There is a difference between the regular army of the Nation and the
militia of a State when not in service ,of the Nation, and more rigid
rules and a higher state of discipline are required in the former than
in the latter.

orably discharging an officer of the United States Army
under the act of October 1, 1890, are stated in-the opinion.
Mr. Alexander S. Bacon for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Harr for defendant in
error.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
Plaintiff in error filed a petition in the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia for a writ of certiorari to
review the proceedings of a board of examination convened under the authority of the act of Congress of October 1, 1890, entitled "An Act to provide for the examination of certain officers of the Army and to regulate
promotions therein," .(c. 1241, 26 Stat. 562), and to annul
an order made by the President discharging plaintiff in
error from the army.
The basis of the petition is that by a prior decision of
the board he became entitled, by virtue of the act of Congress, to be retired with three-quarters pay for life.
A writ was issued, directed to General Frederick C.
Ainsworth, Military Secretary.
He appeared and moved to quash the writ. The motion was granted and the petition dismissed. The order,
however, was subsequently vacated, and, by leave of the
court, the petition was amended by making William H.
Taft, Secretary of War, one of the respondents.
An amended writ was issued, which the respondents
moved to supersede upon the following grounds: the 'writ
was granted improvidently, and upon an ex parte application; its allowance would be unjust and contrary to
public policy; the petition does not set up any right of
property, title or interest in the alleged office; Congress
has intrusted to the board of examination the decision. of

matters properly arising before it and the court has no
jurisdiction by certiorari to examine the proceedings of
the board; the allowance of the writ would embarrass
the operations of the military service of the United States
and the proper administration of the manifold duties of
the War Department, hindering the enforcement of its
discipline and regulations and the discharge of the legally ordained functions of that branch of the government; the record sought to be reviewed shows that the
petitioner (plaintiff in error) "is not entitled to the issuance of the writ, as it appears by a duly certified and true
extract from said record." The record was fied with the
motion and will be given hereafter.
The motion to supersede was granted, the order reciting "it appearing to the court, without considering
the question of discretion, that the writ of certiorari"
had been "improperly granted." The petition was dismissed at the cost of the petitioner, which ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals expressed the opinion that the
board of examination was military in character and having had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the person the courts were without jurisdiction to review its
decision.
By ยง 3 9f the act of October 1, 1890, the President is
authorized to prescribe a system of examination for all
officers below the rank of major, to determine their fitness for promotion, and it is provided "that if any officer
fails to pass a satisfactory examination and is reported
unfit for promotion, the officer next below 'him in rank,
having passed said examination; shall receive the promotion: And provided, That should the officer fail in his
physical examination and be found' incapacitated for
service by reason of physical disability contracted in line
of duty he shall be retired with the rank to which his
seniority entitled him to be promoted; but if he should

REAVES v. AINSWORTH.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

fail for any other reason he shall be suspended from promotion for one year, when he shall be re-examined, and in
case of failure of such re-examination he shall be honorably
discharged with one year's pay from the army;
and no act shall be so construed as to limit or restrict
the retirement of officers as herein provided for."
This statute constitutes the law of the case. The material facts are these: Plaintiff in error was a second lieutenant of artillery on sick leave at Fort Hamilton on account of neurasthenia, resulting from overwork in the
Philippine Islands. On August 16, 1904, he was ordered
for promotion before a board of examination, constituted
of five members, two of whom were surgeons. The surgeons found him physically fit for duty, but he was, on
their recommendation, allowed to return to Fort Hamilton. On October 5, 1904, while still on sick leave,, he
was again ordered to Fort Monroe before the same board
and forced to take a mental examination. He broke down
completely and was found deficient. On May 22, 1905,
he was again ordered before the board for reexamination,
and appeared before it on the twenty-third. On the
twenty-fourth the board made the following order, which
was referred to above in connection with the motion to
supersede the writ:
"The board is of opinion that 2d Lieut. Winslow H.
Reaves, Art'l Corps, is physically incapacitated for service at the present time, but that there is a reasonable
hope of his recovery. Lieut. Reaves' present condition
is such that it is not possible for him to proceed with the
mental examination, without serious interference with
his future recovery.
("His disability is due to severe cerebral and cardiovascular neurasthenia, contracted in line of duty."
Subsequently he was ordered to appear before the same
examining board convened by special order of the President, but changed as to a majority of its members. The

219 V. S.

board convened at Fort Monroe August 21, 1905, and

he appeared before it pursuant to orders. He was found
physically fit for duty. He failed, however, in his mental
examination, and, we may assume, although it is not directly averred, that in consequence of the report of the
board the President made the order above set out, honorably discharging the plaintiff in error from the service
of the United States. This order he attacks and urges
that of the twenty-fourth of May as the foundation of
his rights and contentions. Ie maintains that the surgeons having reported as therein set out, and their report having been confirmed by a full board of five officers
and forwarded to the Secretary of War, it, under the expressed wording of the statute of October 1, 1890, had
the finality of an acquittal of a court martial, "and that,
by the operation of the statute," plaintiff in error "was
thereupon retired and entitled to retired pay during life,
instead of being dismissed from the service with one year's
pay," and that, as such right became absolute by the
report of the surgeons and the action of the board thereon,
the subsequent proceedings of the board were without
jurisdiction and void, and that they and the President's
order deprived him of his property without due process
of law.
Plaintiff in error misunderstands the order of May 24.
It is not a final order but a provisional one. it was an
indulgence to the afflicted officer, giving him a chance
for recovery and promotion and assignment to the active
list of his profession. And we have no doubt of the power
of the board to make it and reserve jurisdiction for
ffirther proceedings.
It is next contended that even if the board had jurisdiction its proceedings subsequent to the order of May. 24,
1905, were arbitrary and illegal, and that the relief prayed
does not involve the "question of interference with the
discretion of the board; it is a question of the jurisdic-

219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

tion of the board and of the fact that discretion, if exercised, was abused." On this contention the averments
of the petition have a more pertinent bearing than on the
first contention. The petition described with much detail and quite vividly his disability. He alleges that for
the last two years he has been suffering from an extremely
acute case of cerebral neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion, for which he has been almost continuously under
the care of physicians, some of whom are the most famous
in the world as specialists for nervous diseases. And,
further, that he is to-day in as bad a condition as at any
time during the last two years and is wholly unable to
exercise mental effort; his memory is at times a blank,
and it is, and for two years has been, utterly impossible
for him "to study, read or think consecutively, except
for a few moments at a time, and 'his' sleep has not averaged more than about two and one-half hours per day."
This was his condition, it is alleged, when he was ordered
before the first board. The allegations are supported by
an affidavit of Dr. Weir Mitchell and Dr. John K. Mitchell. The affidavit, which was submitted to the first
board, illustrated his condition and its effects in various
ways and declared that from the experience and knowledge obtained from actual'attendance upon him he was
not "competent to undergo a mental examination or to
do any military duty."
This condition is further set forth in the petition, and
the affidavit which accompanied it, with circumstances
of emphasis, and there is an intimation that the final action of the 'board was contrived. The details we may omit.
The important facts which are alleged and which, as it
is contended, give character to the action of the board as
illegal and arbitrary are the following: The' board had
before it papers from the War Department and his counsel made a series of motions for permission to examine
them and to inspect the other evidence, which included

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

documents of all kinds, reports of surgeons and the report
of the surgeons made to the board May 23, 1905.
A motion was also made to strike out the report of the
surgeons, un the ground that the report of the examining
board of May 24, 1905, was final, and plaintiff in error's
retirement was mandatory under said report and. the act
of Congress of October 1, 1890.
-The motions were all denied except the request to produce witnesses. At the request of the board he presented
the names of about thirty witnesses who were physicians
and had had him under observation for different periods
of time, and all of whom could swear to facts, exact symptoms of his malady, and besides could give expert evidence as to his condition while under observation. The
names of the witnesses and the facts were given. It was
offered to be shown that the reports of the surgeon who
had charge of a hospital at Fort McPherson, Georgia, to
which plaintiff had been sent, that he was competent to
do duty, were not based on facts or the reports of the attendants, "but were prepared negligently, ignorantly,
wickedly and corruptly." And an offer was made to produce the attendants with their official reports.
The board refused to call in witnesses, on the ground
that the doctors named had already filed certificates, and
that the laymen were not expert witnesses. Plaintiff in
error was not allowed to call witnesses, nor to inspect exhibits presented to the board, nor to cioss-examine the
surgeons on their report. All -testimony, documentary or
otherwise, was taken in secret.
The board went into executive session and formally reported plaintiff in error to be without physical disqualification and competent to take the examination and to
do the duty of a first lieutenant of artillery. He was
thereupon ordered to take such examination, and attempted- to take the same, until prevented by spells of.
weeping and other marked symptoms of neurasthenia.

REAVES v. AINSWORTH.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Thereupon the post surgeon made a certificate as to his
condition and put him on the sick report, and on the following day the surgeons of. the board were sent to Fort
Monroe and superseded the post surgeon, and plaintiff
in error was forced to go through "the farcical form of an
examination under the personal supervision of the board
surgeons, turning in practically blank examination papers,
petitioner's mind being almost a blank."
The prayer is for a writ of certiorari to bring up all of
the proceedings which we have detailed, that they may
be reviewed and that the following order discharging him
from the army be annulled. The order is annexed to the
petition as an exhibit and is as follows:
"4. By direction of the President, 2d Lieutenant Wilson Hart Reaves, Artillery Corps, is honorably discharged
from the services of the United States, under the provision of the Act of Congress approved October 1, 1890,
to take effect September 14, 1905 (1052959, M. S. 0.).
"By order of the Acting Secretary of War.
"J. C. BATES,
"Majqr General, Acting Chief of Staff.
"Official: F. C. AiNSWOCTH,
"The Military Secretary."
And it is further prayed that petitioner .be put upon the
retired list under the act of October 1, 1890, and the findings of the board of May 24, 105, and that the prokeedings of the board and of the Aceing Secretary of War subsequent to that date be found to be void and ,without
effect. And such further relief is prayed as may be
just.
The petition is verified and is accompanied by an affidavit of plaintiff in eiror's counsel, corroborating with
some detail its statements of the, mental ,nd physical
condition of plaintiff in error.
It will be seen that the report of the board of May 24,

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

1905, is made by the petition, and urged in the argument,
as the foundation of the rights of plaintiff in error. It is
argued that his commission in the army constituted property of which to be retired from the army, with pay for
life, was a valuable attribute, and of which he could not
be deprived without due process of law. Such process,
he urges, "consists of two independent parts, both of
which must be lawful; one, the proceeding before the
board of examination and its report, which conforms in
all respects to a 'decision' by a judge, which is the foundation of a judgment' second, the confirmation of that
report by the President." These being filed, it is further
argued all subsequent proceedings affecting them, if without jurisdictional support, as it is contended they are, are
void and may be declared so, and plaintiff in error's right
to be promoted and put upon the retired list adjudged.
But the contention and argument are without foundation,
as we have seen, and the ease presented by the petition
does not exist. It is not necessary therefore to review
the able argument of counsel. It is based entirely on the
unsound assumption which we have pointed out. Besides, what is due process of law must be determined by
circumstances. To those in the military or naval service
of the United States the military law is due process. The
decision, therefore, of a military tribunal acting within
the scope of its lawful powers cannot be reviewed or set
aside by the courts. Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S. 109.
See also Mullan v. United States, 212 U. S. 516.
It is contended, however, that the board of examination did not observe the procedure required by law, and
that they are bound, as retiring boards are bound under
ยง 1248 of the Revised Statutes, "to inquire into and determine the facts touching the nature and occasion of the
disability of an officer,
.
and shall have such
powers of a court-martial and of a court of inquiry, as may
be necessary for that purpose."

REAVES v. AINSWORTH.
219 U. S.'

Opinion of the Court.

But the act of October 1, 1890, has a different purpose
from the ietirement-of an officer from service. Its purpose is to secure efficiency in those who are to be active
in service, and physical capacity, of course, is as necessary
as mental capacity, but no fixed procedure is provided
by the statute to ascertain either, but by very comprehensive words power is conferred upon the President to
"prescribe a system of examination of all officers of the
army, to be conducted at special times anterior to the
acquiring of the right of promotion as may be best for
the interests of the service." This power is exercised
through special orders creating examining boards which
define their membership and duties. For officers of artillery the board shall consist of five members, two of
whom shall be medical officers, and a recorder, all of
whom take an oath to act and report impartially. The
medical officers are required to make the necessary physical examination of all officers, reporting their opinion
to the board by which "all questions relating to the physical condition of an officer shall be determined." The
orders directed that "if anything should arise during the
examination regarding the introduction of evidence, the
inquiry shall proceed upon written interrogatories as far
as possible, the board determining to whom questions
shall be forwarded." If it becomes necessary to take oral
testimony the fact must be reported to the War Department for the necessary'orders in regard to witnesses summoned from a distance.
The record, where an officer is found physically disqualified, must be authenticated by all members of the
board and the recorder. If the disability be the result
of an incident of the service, and the proceedings of the
board be approved by the President, the officer "shall be
regarded as physically unfit for promotion within the
meaning of section 3 of the act of October 1, 1890, and
shall be retired with the rank to which his seniority envoL. ccxix-20

titles him whenever a vacancy, occurs that otherwise
would result in his promotion on the active list."
If it be disputable whether these provisions guarantee
to an officer "the safeguards of a trial in court," it is certain that the decision is not final with the board but must
be reported with the proceedings to the President, and
may be approved or disapproved by him. This is the
only relief from the errors or the injustice that may be
done by the board which is provided. The courts have
no power to review. The courts are not the only instrumentalities of government. They cannot command or
regulate the army. To be promoted or to be retired may
be the right of an officer, the value to him of his commission, but greater even than that is the welfare of. the,
country, and, it may be, even its safety, through the efficiency of the army. And this was the motive of the
-act of October 1, 1890, and naturally its accomplishment
was intrusted to the President. He executed the trust
by constituting examining boards, defining their duty and
reserving to himself the ultimate review of their proceedings and decision. This is the protection which the act
of Colgress gives to the rights conferred by it. If it had
been the intention of Congress to give to an officer the
right to raise issues and controversies with the board upon
the elements, physical and mental, of his qualifications
for promotion and carry them over the head of the President to the courts, and there litigated, it may be, through
a course of years, upon the assertion of error or injustice
in the board's rulings or decisions, such intention would
have been explicitly declared. The embarrassment of
such a right to the service, indeed the detriment of it,
may be imagined.
It is, however, contended that People ex rel. Smith v.
Hoffman, 166 N. Y. 462, sustains the right of review. The
case does not support the contention. The decision was
based on the statutes of the State, which made, it was

decided, the military board, whose action was reviewed,
a judicial tribunal, and its decision subject to be reviewed
by certiorari. And, replying to the argument against
the existence of the power of the courts to review the determination of a military tribunal and the cases from the
Federal courts, adduced to support the argument, the
court said, "there is a Wide difference between the regular army of the Nation and the militia of a State when
not in the service of the Nation," and that "more rigid
rules and a -higher state of discipline are required in the
one case than in the 8ther."
Judgment affirmed.

No. 56. Argued and submitted November29, 1910.-Decided January 16,

The business of fire insurance is of an extensive and peculiar character,
concerning a large number of people; and it is within.the police power
of the State to adopt such regulations as will protect the public
against the evils arising from combinations of those engaged in such
business, and to substitute competition for monopoly; and regulations which have a real substantial relation to that end and are not
essentially arbitrary do not deprive the insurance companies of their
property without due process of law.
All corporations, associations and individuals, within its jurisdiction,
are subject to such regulations in respect of their relative rights and
duties as the State may, in the exercise of its police power and in
harmony with its own and the Federal Constitution, prescribe for
the public convenience and the general good; and the State may also
prescribe, within such limits, the particular means of enforcing such
regulations.
