The court de-

Appeals dismissed without costs to either party, it having developed
from statements of counsel for both parties that the cases had become purely moot because of the settlement between the parties of
every material controversy which the record presented.
THE

facts are. stated in the opinion.

Mr. Daniel Davenport and Mr. J. J. Darlington for
The Buck's Stove & Range Company.
Mr. Jackson H. Ralston, Mr. F. L. Siddons and. Mr.
William E. Richardson for The American Federation of
Labor et al.
Per Curiam: When these cases were reached for hearing and after the argument had materially progressed, it
developed from statements made by counsel for both
parties that the cases had become purely moot because
of the settlement between the parties of every material
controversy which the record presented. On the disclosure of this situation further argument was dispensed
with; and for the reason which led to that action, that is,
as we have said, that the controversies between the parties had become in all respects moot, the appeals must be
dismissed. Richardson v. McChesney, 218 U. S. 487, 492,
and cases cited. Appeals dismissed, without costs to
either party.
