CHICAGO, BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD COMPANY v. McGUIRE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IOWA.
No. 62.

Argued December 5, 6, 1910.-Decided February 20, 1911.

Neither the excellence nor the defects of a legislative scheme may be
permitted to determine the constitutionality of a state statute; in
this court the only question is whether the statute transcends the
limits of power :defined by the Federal Constitution.
The legislature, provided it acts within constitutional limitations, is
the arbiter of the public policy of the State; and it may by amendment enlarge the scope of a statute beyond the limits set upon the
previous statute by the courts.
While the court may, in the absence of legislation and in the light of
the common law, uphold or condemn contracts in the light of what
is conceived to be public policy, that determination must yield .to the
legislative will when constitutionally expressed thereafter.
A State has power to prohibit contracts limiting liability for injuries
made in advance of the injury received, and to provide that the
subsequent acceptance of benefits under such contracts shall not
constitute satisfaction of the claim for injuries received after the
contract. Such a statute does not impair, the liberty of contract
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; and so held as to the
Iowa statute relative to employds of railway companies.
Freedom of contract is a qualified and not an absolute right. There is
no abolute freedom to contract as dne chooses. Liberty implies the
absence of arbitrary restraint-not immunity from reasonable
regulations.
Where police legislation has a reasonable relation to an object within
governmental authority the legislative discretion is not subject to
judicial review.
The scope of judicial inquiry as to a statute is limited to the question
of power to enact, while the scope of legislative consideration includes the matter of policy,
Where the legislature has power to establish a regulation, it has also
power to prohibit co'ntracts in derogation of such regulation.

with its employds and contributions from both employds and the

company, such as the one involved in this case, is a wise and proper
scheme which should be approved, or an unwise scheme which should
be disapproved by the public policy of the State is under the control
of the legislative power of the State; and the statute of Iowa prohibiting contracts between the railway companies and their employ~s limiting the right to recover damages at common law, is
within the police power of the State, has a reasonable relation to the
matter regulated, and is not unconstitutional under the due process
or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
A statute does not necessarily deny equal protection of the law because limited to railway employ6s of a certain class.
The *classification of the original statute having been sustained by this
court, and there being no criticism of the amendment thereto involved in this case that would' not equally apply to the original
statute, the amendment will not'be declared unconstitutional as
denying equal protection of the law.
131 Iowa, 340, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of a law
of the State of Iowa, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John J. Herriok, with whom Mr. Cheater M. Dawes
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The statute is void as in violation of the due process
provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. Freedom to
enter into contracts is both a liberty and a property right,
secured alike to all and not to be encroached upon by the
State under guise of its police power. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45;
Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540; Adair v.
United States, 208 U. S. 161; McLean v. Arkansas, 211
U. S. 539.
The contract of accord and satisfaction, resulting from
the acceptance of benefits under the contract of membership, is based on mutual consideration, valid and enforcible. Donald v. C., B. & Q. Ry. Co., 93 Iowa, 284;
Maine v. C., B. & Q.Ry. Co., 109 Iowa, 260 .
A statute which prohibits the exercise of the power to
make coatracts, otherwise lawful, must have for its pur-

pose one within the police power, and must be reasonably
appropriate to accomplish it. Mugler v. Kansas, 123
U. S. 623, 661; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 137; Railway Co. v. Smith, 173 U. S. 684, 689, 699; Lochner v. New
York, .198 U. S. 45; Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161.
The statute cannot be sustained as an authorized exercise of the police power. It did not prohibit or otherwise make unlawful the contracts of benefit, or the contracts of release, by the acceptance of benefits under
them, but only provided that such contracts, and the acceptance of benefits under them, should not bar a recovery from the class of corporations iteferred to, by a
particular class of employds, for a particular class of liabilities. As to construction of the statute by the state
courts see Deppe v. Railroad Co., 36 Iowa, 52; Malone v.
Railway Co., 65 Iowa, 417; Akeson v. Railway Co., 106
Iowa, 54; Reddington v. Railway Co., 108 Iowa, 96;
Hughes v. Railway Co., 128 Iowa, 207; Dunn v. Railway
Co., 130 Iowa, 580.
It follows that in all other classes of. cases in which there
was a common-law liability for negligence-in which the
fellow-servant rule did not aply-there could be a recovery at common law. Baldwin v. St. L., K. & N. Ry..
Co., 75 Iow, 297; McQueen[ v. C., M. & Rt. P. Ry. Co.,
120 Iowa, 522, 524; Beresford v. American Coal Co., 124
Iowa, 34; Klaffke v. Bettendorf Axle Co., 125 Iowa, 223;
Scott v. Iowa Telephone Co., 126 Iowa, 524,.527.
The statute cannot be sustained as an exercise of the
police power on the ground that the end in view was to
promote the public safety and welfare, and that it was
appropriate and reasonably necessary to that end.
Neither the rule of the defendant's Relief Department
nor the contract of membership, nor the contract of release, which, under the decisions results from the acceptance of the benefits after the cause of action has accrued,
limits in any way the company's liability for negligence.

.Nothing in the rule of defendant's Relief Department,
or the contract of release, that results from the acceptance
of the benefits on the terms of the membership contract,
is at all detrimental to the public welfare. Donald v.

The statute cannot be sustained as an authorized exercise of the police power on the ground that it was passed
for the protection of labor, and by reason of a supposed
-inequality of advantage between the employer and its
employ6s, or on any of the grounds stated in the opinion
of the Supreme Court of Iowa.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

The act is an unauthorized interference with the freedom of contract, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cox v. Railway Co., 1 Ohio N. P. 213; Farrow v.
Railway Co., 7 Ohio N. P. 606; Shaver v. Penna. R. R. Co.,
71 Fed. Rep. 931; Sturgiss v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co.,
80 S.Car. 167; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Dunning,
166 Fed. Rep. 850; P., C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Cox, 55
Ohio St. 497; Railway Co. v. Moore, 152 Indiana, 345.
The statute denies the equal protection of the laws.
A classification for the purpose of legislation cannot be
made arbitrarily, but must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act
in respect to which the classification is made. Gulf, C. &
S. F. Ry. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S.150, 155; Railway Co. v.
Paul, 173 U. S. 404; Life Assn. v. Mettler, 185 U. S.308;
Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U. S.377, 382; Railway Co. v.
Smith, 173 U. S.684, 696; Cotting v. Stockyards Co., 183
U. S.79; Connolly v. Pipe Co., 184 U. S.540; Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U. S.356, 369.
The classification made by the limitation of the prohibition of the act-that the particular contracts of settlement shall not be set up in bar of a recovery-of liabilities
to a particular class of employds does not rest upon any

difference which bears a reasonable ahd just relation to
the thing prohibited, and is therefore a mere arbitrary
classification.
Mr. A. J. Baker for defendant in error submitted:
The Temple amendment is not unconstitutional.
In passing on the constitutionality of any given law
this court may not consider evils which it is supposed
will arise from the execution of the law, whether they be
real or imaginary; nor is it its province to pass upon the
policy, wisdom, or justice of the statute or the expediency
of its enactment. Howard v. Illinois CentralR. R. Co., 207

to determine when an act is necessary in the exercise of

MR. JUsTicE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
Charles L. McGuire, the defendant in error, while acting as a brakeman in the service of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company in Iowa, in the year
1900, received injuries through negligence imputable to
the Company and recovered judgment in the District
Court of that State for the sum of $2,000. By stipulation,
the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company

was joined in the judgment. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa and the companies bring
this writ of error.
The question presented is with respect to the validity of
§ 2071 of the Code of Iowa as amended in the year 1898,
which was held to preclude the Railroad Company from
making the defense that recovery was barred by the acceptance of benefits under a contract of membership in its
Relief Department.
The section in its original form was as follows:
"Every corporation operating a railway shall be liable
for all damages sustained by any person, including the
employ6s of such corporation, in consequence of the neglect of the agents, or by any mismanagement of the engineers or other employds thereof, and in consequence of
the wilful wrongs, whether of commission or omission of
such agents, engineers, or other employds; when such
wrongs are in any manner connected with the use and
,operation of any railway on or about which they shall be
employed and no contract which restricts such liability
shall be legal or binding."
The amendment of 1898 added the following provision:
"Nor shall any contract of insurance relief, benefit or
indemnity in case of injury or death, entered into prior to
the injury, between the person so injured and such corporation or any other person or association acting for such
corporation, nor shall the acceptance of any such relief,
insurance, benefit or indemnity by the person injured, his
widow, heirs or legal representatives after the injury, from
such corporation, person or association, constitute any
bar or defense to any cause of action brought under the
provisions of this section- but nothing contained herein
shall be construed to prevent or invalidate any settlement
for damages between the parties subsequent to the injuries received."
The question arose upon demurrer to the defense in the

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R. CO. v. McGUIRE. 561
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

answer of the Railroad Company, which asserted the bar
denied by the statute. This defense, in substance, alleged
that in November, 1900, and prior to his injury, the defendant in error had voluntarily become a member of the
Relief Department of the Railroad Company and thereupon had agreed that the acceptance of benefits payable
to him in accordance with the regulations of the department should discharge the Company from all liability for
damages; that after he had sustained the injuries alleged
in his petition, he had received benefits from the Relief
Fund of the departmbnt amounting to $822.; and that the
payment and acceptance of these benefits constituted,
under the agreement, full satisfaction of the claim in suit.
The facts with regard to the organization, purpose and
management of the Relief Department, and the regulations governing it, were fully averred. The department
was organized in 1889, as a part of the, service of the Railroad Company, with the object of creating a fund out of
which definite amounts of money should be paid to contributing employ~s in the event of disability from sickness
or accident, or in case of death for their proper burial and
the relief of their families. The various companies forming the Burlington system organized similar departments,
and by agreement these were associated in joint administration.
The regulations of the Relief Department provided that
membership in the department should be voluntary and
defined the amount of contributions to be paid monthly,
the members being classified for this purpose according to
their monthly wages. The amount of benefits according
to these classes was also specified. The Relief Fund consisted of the contributions of members, income from investments, interest paid by the Railroad Company on
monthly balances and appropriations made by the Company when necessary to cover deficiencies. From the
time of organization to December 31, 1900, there was paid

in benefits out of the fund so constituted the sum of
$2,671,510.54, of which $1,294,790.50 was paid by reason
of sickness and $1,376,720.04 for injuries and death.
The Railroad Company had general charge of the Relief
Department and guaranteed the fulfilment of its obligations. It was responsible for the safe-keeping of the
moneys of the Relief Fund, paid into the fund interest at
the rate of four per centum per annum on monthly balances, supplied without expense to the fund the necessary
facilities for the business of the department, and defrayed
from the moneys of the Company the operating expenses.
It was alleged that for these expenses the Company had
paid to December, 1900, $621,572.44. This sum did not
include office rent for the department or of medical examiners or various sundry expenses; nor did it embrace
the service of officers and of clerks who were not wholly
concerned with the work of the department, and this
service and incidental expenses were alleged to be worth
approximately $50,000 a year. In addition, during the
period mentioned the Railroad Company paid to make up
deficits in the fund the sum of $42,532.94, for which it had
no right to reimbursement .
Among the regulations by which the members of the
Relief Depgrtment agreed to be bound was the following:
"64. In case of injury to a member he may elect to
accept the benefits in pursuance of these regulations, or to
prosecute such claims as he may have at law against the
Company or any Company associated. therewith in the
administration of their Relief Departments.
"The acceptance by the member of benefits for injury
shall operate as a release and satisfaction of: all claims
against the Company and all other companies associated
therewith as aforesaid, for damages arising from or growing out of such injury; and further, in the event of the
death of a memberno part ef the death benefit or unpaid
disabiiity benefit shall be due or payable unless and until

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R. CO. v. McGUIRE. 563
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

good and sufficient releases shall be delivered to the
superintendent, of all claims against the 'P.elief Department, as well as against the Company and all other cornpanies associated therewith as aforesaid, arising from or
growing out of the death of the member, said releases
Laving been duly executed by all who might legally assert
such claims; and further, if any Suit shall be brought
against the Company or any other company associated
thereWith as aforesaid, for damages arising from or grow-ing out of injury or death occurring to a member, the benefits otherwise payable and all obligations of the Relief
Department and of the Company created by the membership of "'uch member in the Relief Fund shall thereupon be
forfeited without any declaration or other act by the Relief Department or the Company; but the'superintendent
may, in his discretion waive such forfeiture upon condition that all pending suits shall first be dismissed.
"The payment by the Company, or any Company associated therewith as aforesaid, of any amount in compromise of a claim for damages arising from or growing
out of an injury to, or the death of, a member, shall preclude any and all claims for benefits from the Relief Fund
arising from or growing out of such injury or death."
In support of the defense based upon this regulation,
the Railroad Company further asserted that the amended
statute above quoted did not deprive it of the right to
plead the contract with the defendant in error, and its
satisfaction, as a discharge, for the reason that the statute
was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, (1) as an unwarranted interference with liberty to make contracts, and (2) as a
denial of the equal protection of the laws.
The District Court overruled the demurrer, but its
judgment was reversed. by the Supreme Court of the
State, which held the statute to be valid and in consequence that the .demurier should have been sustained.

McGuire v. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co., 131 Iowa, 340. This
ruling was adhered to when the question was again raised
on the appeal to that court from the final judgment. 138
Iowa, 664. And to review this decision as to the constitutionality of the statute, the case has been brought
here.
We pass without comment the criticisms which are
made of certain details of the relief plan, for neither the
suggested excellence nor the alleged defects of a particular
scheme may be permitted to determine the validity of the
statute, which is general in its application. The question
with which we are concerned is not whether the regulations
set forth in the answer are just or unjust, but whether the
amended statute transcends the limits of power as defined
by the Federal Constitution.
The first ground of attack is that the statute violates
the Fourteenth Amendment by reason of the restraint it
lays u'on liberty of contract. This section of the Code of
Iowa (§ 2071), as originally enacted, imposed liability
upon railroad corporations for injuries to employ6s, although caused by the negligence or mismanagement of
fellow-servants. And it was held by this court that it was
clearly within the competency of the legislature to prescribe this measure of responsibility. Minneapolis & St.
Louis Railway Co. v. Herrick, 127 U. S. 210, following
Missouri Railway Co. v. Mackey, 127 U. S. 205.. The
statute in its original form also provided that "no contract which restricts such liability shall be legal or binding."
Subsequent to,this enactment the Railroad Company
established its Relief Department, and the question was
raised in the state court as to the legality of the provision
then incorporated in the contract of membership, by
which, in case of suit for damages, the payment of. benefits was to be suspended until the suit should be discon-

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R. CO. v. McGUIRE. 565
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

tinued, and the acceptance of benefits was to operate as a
full discharge. The two principal contentions against it
were, first; that it was against public policy, and second,
that it was in violation of the statute. Both were overruled, and with reference to the statute it was held that
the contract of membership did not fall within the prohibition for the reason that it did not restrict liability but
put the employ6 to his election. Donald v. C., B. & Q. Ry.
Co., 93 Iowa, 284; Maine v. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co., 109
Iowa, 260. The legislature then amended the sectifh by
providing expressly that a contract of this sort and the
acceptance of benefits should not defeat the enforcement
of the liability which the statute defined.
Manifestly the decision that the existing statute-was not
broad enough to embrace the inhibition did not prevent
the legislature from enlarging its scope so that it should be
included. Nor was the holding of the court final upon the
point of public policy, so far as the power of the legislature
is concerned. The legislature, provided it acts within' its
constitutional authority, is the arbiter of the public policy
of the State. While the court, unaided by legislative
declaration and applying the principles of the common
law, may uphold or condemn contracts in the light of what
is conceived to be public policy, its determination as a
rule for future action must yield to the legislative will
when expressed in accordance with the organic law. If
the legislature had the power to incorporate a similar
provision in the statute when it was passed originally, it
had .the same power with regard to future transactions to
enact the amendment.
It may also be observed that the statute, as amended,
does not affect contracts of settlement or compromise
made after the injury, and the question of the extent of
the legislative power with respect to such contracts is not
presented. The amendment provides, "but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or invalidate

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.,
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

any settlement for damages between the parties subsequent to the injuries received." As was said by the state
court in construing the act (131 Iowa, p. 377): "The legislature does not in this act -forbid or place any obstacle in
the way of such insurance, nor does it forbid or prevent any
settlement of the matter of damages with an injured employd fairly made after the injury is received. On the contrary, the right to make such settlement is expressly provided for in the amendment to -Code § 2071. The one
.thing which that amendment was intended to prevent
was the use of this insurance or relief for which the em-.
ploy6 has himself paid in whole or in part, as a bar to the
right which the statute has given, him to recover damages
from the corporation." -It is, -urged, however, that the
amendatory act prohibits the making of a contract for
settlement "by acts done gter the liability had-become
'fixed." The acceptance of benefits is, of course, an act
done after the injury, but the legal consequences sought
to be attached to that act are derived from .the provision
-in the contract of membership. The stipulation which the
statute nullifies is one made ifn advance of the injury that
the subsequent.acceptance of benefits shall constitute full
satisfaction of the claim for damages. -It is in this aspect
that the question arises' as to the restriction of liberty of
contract.
It has been held that the right to make contracts is embraced in the conception of liberty as guaranteed by the
Constitution. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 Vi. S. 578; Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45; Adair v. United States, 208
U. S. 161. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, supra, the court, in
referring to the Fourteenth :Amendment, said (p. 589):
"The liberty mentioned in that amendment means not
only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical restraint of his person, as by incarceration, but the
term is deemed to embrace the right of the citizen to be
free in the enjoyment of all his. faculties; to be free to use

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R. CO. v. McGUIRE. 567
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to
earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any
livelihood or avocation, and for that purpose to enter into
all contracts which may be proper, necessary and essential
to his carrying out to a successful conclusion the purposes
above mentioned." But it was recognized in the cases
cited, as in many others, that freedom of contract is a
qualified and not an absolute right. There is no absolute
freedom to do as one wills oi to contract as one chooses.
The guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative
supervision that wide department of activity which consists of the making of contracts, or deny to government
the power to provide restrictive safeguards. Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity
from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in
the interests of the community. Crowley v. Christensen,
137 U. S. p. 89; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197-U. S. p. 11.
"It is within the undoubted power of government to restrain some individuals from all contracts, as well as all
individuals from some contracts. It may deny to all the
right to contract for the purchase or sale of lottery tickets;
to the minor the right to assume any obligations, except
for the necessaries of existence; to the common carrier the
power to make any contract releasing himself from negligence, and, indeed, may restrain, all engaged in any employment from any contract in the course of that employmnt which is against public policy. The possession
of this power by government in no manner conflicts with
the proposition that, generally speaking, every citizen has
a right freely to contract for the price of his labor, services,
or property." Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. pp. 165,
166.
The right to make contracts is subject to the exercise of
the powers granted to Congress for the suitable conduct
of matters of national concern, as for example the regulation of commerce-with foreign nations and among the

several States. Addyston Pipe. & Steel Co. v. United
States, 175 U. S. pp. 228-231; Pattersonv. The Eudora, 190

It is subject also, in the field of state action, to the essential authority of government to maintain peace and
security, and to enact laws for the promotion of the health,
safety, morals and welfare of those subject to its jurisdiction. This limitation has had abundant illustration in a
variety of circumstances. Thus, in addition to upholding
the power of the State to require reasonable maximum
charges for public service. (Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113;
C., B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Iowa, 94 U. S.155; Railroad Corn-.
mission Cases, 116 U. S.307; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas
Co., 212 U. S.19), and to prescribe the hours of labor for
those employed by the State or its municitialities (Atkin
v. Kansas, 191 U. S. 207), this court has sustained the
validity of state legislation in prohibiting the manufacture
and sale of intoxicating liquors within the State (Mugler
v. Kansas, 123 U. S.623; Crowley v. Christensen, supra);
in limiting employment in underground- mines or workings, and in smelters and other institutions for the reduction or refining of ores or metals, to eight hours a day
except in cases of emergency (Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S.
366)1 in prohibiting the sale of cigarettes without license
(Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183); in requiring the redemption in cash of store orders or other evidences of
indebtedness issued in payment of wages (Knoxville Iron
Co. v. Harbison, 183 U. S,13); in prohibiting contracts for
options to sell or buy grain or-other commodity at a future
time (Booth v. Illinois, 184 U.°S. 425); in prohibiting the
employment of Women in laundries more than ten hours
a day (Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S.412); and in making it
unlawful to contract to pay miners employed at quantity
rates upon the basis of screened coal, instead of the weight

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R. CO. v. McGUIR.. 569
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

of the coal as originally produced in the mine (McLean v.
Arkansas, 211 U. S. 539).
The principle involved in these decisions is that where
the legislative action is arbitrary and has no reasonable
relation to a purpose which it is competent for government to effect, the legislature transcends the limits of its
power in interfering with liberty of contract; but where
there is reasonable relation to an object within the governmental authority, the exercise of the legislative discretion
is not subject to judicial review. The scope of judicial inquiry in deciding the question of power is not to be confused with the scope of legislative considerations in dealing with the matter of policy. Whether the enactment is
wise or unwise, whether it is based' on sound economic
theory, whether it is the best means to achieve the desired
result, whether, in short, the legislative discretion within
its prescribed limits should be exercised in a particular
manner, are matters for the judgment of the legislature,
and the earnest conflict of serious opinion does not suffice
to bring them within the range of judicial cognizance.
The principle was thus stated in McLean v. Arkansas,
211 U. S. 547, 548: "The legislature, being familiar with
local conditions, is, primarily, the judge of the necessity
of such enactments. The mere fact that a court may
differ with the legislature in its views of public policy, or
that judges may hold views inconsistent with the proppriety of the legislation in question, affords no ground for
judicial interference, unless the act in question is unmistakably and palpably in excess of legishtive power.

.

If there existed a condition of

affairs concerning which the legislature of the State, exercising its conceded right to enact laws for the protection of
the health, safety or welfare of the people, might pass the
law, it must be sustained; if such action was arbitrary interference with the right to contract or carry on business,
and having no just relation to the protection of the public

570

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

within, the scope of legislative power, the act must
fail."
In dealing with the relation of employer and employed,
the legislature has necessarily a wide field of discretion in
order that there may be suitable protection of health and
safety, and that peace and good order may be promoted
through regulations designed to insure wholesome conditions of work and freedom from oppression. What differences, as to the extent of this power, may exist with respect to particular employments, and how far that which
may be authorized as to one department of activity may
appear to be arbitrary in another, must be determined as
cases are presented for decision. But it is well established
that, so far as its regulations are valid, not being arbitrary
or unrelated to a proper purpose, the legislature undoubtedly may prevent them from being nullified by prohibiting contracts which by modification or waiver would alter
or impair the obligation imposed. If the legislature may
require the use of safety devices, it may prohibit agreements to dispense with them. If it may restrict employment in mines and smelteTs to eight hours a day, it may
make contracts for longex service, unlawful. In such case
the interference with the Tight to contract is incidental to
the main object of the regulation, and if the power exists
to accomplish the latter, the interference is justified as,
an aid to its exercise. As was pointed out in Holden v.
Hardy, supra, 169 U. S. on page 397: "The legislature has
also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators
in many States has corroborated, that the proprietors of
these establishments and their operatives do,- not standupon an equality, and that their interests are, to a certain
extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain
as much labor as possible from their employs, whife the
latter are often induced by the, fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised,
would pronounce to be detrimental to their heafh or

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY-R. R. CO. v. McGUIRE. 571
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the
rules and the laborers are practically constrained to obey
them. In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide,
and the legislature may properly interpose its authority. . . . But the fact that both parties are of full
age and competent to contract does -not necessarily deprive the State of the power to interfere where the parties
do not stand upon an equality, or where the public health
demands that one party to the contract shall be protected
against himself. 'The State still retains an interest in his
welfare, however reckless he may be. The whole is no
greater than the sum of all the parts, and .when the individual health, safety and welfare are sacrificed or neglected, the State must suffer.' "
Here there is no question as to the validity of the regulation or as to the power of the State to impose the liability
which the statute prescribes. The statute relates to that
phase of the relation of master and servant which is presented by the case of railroad corporations. It defined the
liability of such corporations for injuries resulting from
negligence and mismanagement in the use and operation
of their railways. In the cases within -its purview it extended the liability of the common law by abolishing the
fllow-servant rule. Having authority to establish this
regulation, itis manifest that the legislature was also entitled to insure its efficacy by prohibiting contracts in
derogation of its provisions. In the exercise of this power,
the legislature was not limited with respect either to the
form of the contract, or the nature of the consideration, or
the absolute or conditional character of the engagement.
It Was as competent to prohibit contracts, which on a
specified event, or in a given contingency, should operate
to relieve the corporation from the statutory liability
which would otherwise exist as it was to deny validity to
agreements of absolute waiver.
The policy of the amendatory act was the same as that

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

of the original statute. Its provision that contracts of insurance relief, benefit or indemnity, -and the acceptance
of such benefits, should not defeat recovery under the
statute, was incidental *to the tegulation it was intended
to enforce. Assuming the right of enforcement, the authority to enact this inhibition cannot be denied. If the
legislature had the power to prohibit contracts limiting
the liability imposed, it certainly could include in the
prohibition stipulations of that sort in contracts of insurance relief, benefit or indemnity, as well as in other agreements. But if the legislature could specifically provide
that no contract'for insurance relief should limit the liability for damages, upon what ground can it be said that it
was beyond the legislative authority to deny that reffect
to the payment of benefits, or the acceptance of such pay-.
ment, under the contract?
The asserted distinction is sought to be based upon the
fact that under the contract pf membership the employ,6
has an election after the injury. But this circunistance,
however appropriate it may be. for legislative consideration, cannot be regarded as defining a limitation of legislative power. The power to prohibit contracts, in' any case
where it exists, necessarily implies legislative control over
the transaction, despite the action of the parties. Whether
this control may be exercised in a particular'case depends
upon the relation of the transaction to the execution of a
policy which the State is competent to establish. It does
not aid the argument to describe the defense as one of accord and satisfaction. The payment of benefits is the
performance of the promise to pay contained in the contract of membership. If the legislature may prohibit the
acceptance of the promise as a substitution for the statutory liability, it should also be able to prevent the like
substitution of its performance.
For the reasons we have stated, the considerations
which properly bear upon the wisdom of the legislation

CHICAGO, B. & QUINCY R. R... CO. v. McGUIRE. 573
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

need not be discussed. On the one hand it is said that the
Relief Department is in the control of the corporation;
that by reason of their~exigency the employds may readily
be constrained to become members; that the relief fund
consists in larger part of contributions made from wages;
that the acceptance of benefits takes place at a time when
the employ6 is suffering from the consequences of his injury and, being seriously in need of aid, he may easily be
induced to accept payment from the fund in which," by
reason of his contributions, he feels that he is entitled to
share; and that such a plan, if it were permitted through
the payment of benefits to result ina discharge of the liability for negligence, would operate to transfer from the corporation to its employds a burden which, in the interest of
their protection and the safety of the public, the corporation should be compelled to bear. On the other hand it is
urged that the relief plan is a beneficent scheme'avoiding
the waste of litigation, securing prompt relief in case of
need due to sickness or injury, making equitable provision
for deserving cases, and hence tends in an important way
to promote the good of the service and the security of the
employment. Even a partial statement of these various
considerations shows clearly that they are of a character
to invoke the judgment of the legislature in deciding,
within the limits of its power, upon the policy of the State.
And, whether- the policy declared by the statute in question is approved or disapproved, it cannot be said that the
legislative power has been exceeded either in defining the
liability or in the means taken to prevent the legislative
will, with respect to it, from being thwarted.
The second ground upon which the statute, as amended,
is assailed is that it constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws.
It is urged that the prohibition of the amendatory act
applies only to those employ6s of railroad corporations
who were embraced within the provision of the original

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

statute, and to the enforcement of the particular liabilities
which that statute defined. The limitation to a particular
class of employ6s of railroad corporations is based upon
the decisions of the state court that the benefits of the
original statute were confined to those who were engaged
in the hazardous business of operating railroads. Deppe
v. Railroad Co., 36 Iowa, 52; Malone v. Railway Co., 65

Iowa, 417; Akeson v. Railway Co., 106 Iowa, 54. It is said
that all employds of the plaintiffs in error may become
members of the Relief Department and that the limited
application of the amendment, as to the effect of the acceptance, of benefits under the membership contract, is an
invalid discrimination.
It was, however, entirely competent for the legislature
in enacting the prohibition, for the purpose of securing the
enforcement of the liability it had defined, to limit it to
those cases in which the liabiliry arose. As the purpose of
the amendment was to supplement the original statute,
the classification was properly the same. And with respect to subsequent transactions the amendment must be
regarded as having the same validity as it would have had
if it had -formed a part of the earlier enactment. No
criticism on the ground of discrimination can successfully
