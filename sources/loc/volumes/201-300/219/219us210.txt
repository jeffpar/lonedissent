MATTER OF GREGORY, PETITIONER.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.
No. 17, Original.

Argued December 5, 1910.-Decided January 3, 1911.

Habeas corpus cannot be made to perform the functions of a writ of
error, and this court is concerned only with the questions of
whether the information is sufficient, or whether the committing
court properly applied the law if that court had jurisdiction to
try the issues and render the judgment. Harlan v. McGourin, 218
U. S. 442.
The provisions and prohibitions of § 1176 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia are not. limited to transactions
previously licensed by the act of August 23, 1871, but expressly include gift enterprises conducted in any manner, whether defined in
said act or otherwise;
Section 1177 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia punishes a recognized category of offenses within the power
of Congress to punish and is not controlled or rendered invalid by a
definition of the prohibited crime in an earlier statute which has
been repealed.
Where the statute defining the crime is valid, it is within the range of
judicial consideration to determine whether the acts of the accused
are within the definition, and if the court has jurisdiction its judgment cannot be reviewed on habeas corpus.
.
The police court of the District of Columbia has jurisdiction t6 try
persons charged on information of violating § 1177 of the Revised
Statutes relating to the District of Columbia prohibiting engaging in
gift enterprises, and the judgment of that court determining that the
acts of accused fell within the definition of .gift enterprise is not Teviewable on habeas corpus proceedings.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality and construction of §§ 1176, 1177 of the Revised Statutes relating
to the District of Columbia prohibiting and punishing
gift-enterprises, and the validity of a conviction thereunder, are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Petitioner.

Mr. John Hall Jones and Mr. W. Benton Crisp for petitioner:
Section 1177 of the Revised Statutes relating to the
District of Columbia does not define gift-enterprises.
Such definition is found in the laws of the District of
Columbia, 1871-73, Part II, 96, and see Re Lansburgh,
11 App. D. C. 512, and opinion in District v. Kraft, referred to in petition in this case.
The answer filed herein bases the jurisdiction of the
Police Court upon the act of 1873. The information
merely charges petitioner with engaging in the business
of a gift-enterprise, which comes within the definition
of the act of 1871, and charges a perfectiy innocent business transaction involving neither moral turpitude, nor
any element of chance.
The court has original jurisdiction to issue the writ of
habeas corpus in this case. Ex pare Bollman & Swartwout, 4 Cr. 75; Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85; Ex parte
Virginia, 100 U. S. 339; Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371.
The prohibition contained in this statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, in that it deprives petitioner of liberty
and property without due process of law, and the courts
below were, therefore, without jurisdiction to try and
sentence petitioner. Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 47,
53; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 661; Lawton v.
Steele, 152 U. S. 133; McLean v. Arkansas, 211 U. S. 539,

307, 313; Ex parte Drexel & Holland, 147 California, 763,

The act does not affect the public health, safety and
morals.

JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. By information filed in the Police Court of the District of Columbia, the petitioner was .charged with engaging "in

the business of a gift-enterprise" in violation of § 1177
of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Colum•bia. Thereupon an agreed statement of facts was filed,
by which it appeared that the petitioner, as the managing officer of The Sperry & Hutchinson Company, was
conducting, within the District, its business of issuing
and redeeming so-called "trading stamps" in the particular manner set forth. It was stipulated that the
statement should be considered as a part of the information, and the petitioner made a motion to quash. This
motion -was sustained and the petitioner was discharged.
On writ of error, the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia reversed the judgment of the Police Court and
ordered the cause to be remanded for further proceedings
in conformity with its opinion. Application was made to
this court for a writ of certiorari, which was refused. 218
U. S.673. The petitioner was then arraigned in the Police Court, pleaded not guilty, and waived trial by jury;
and the case was submitted to the court upon the agreed
statement. Judgment of guilty was entered and the petitioner was sentenced to pay a fine. He then obtained
leave of this court to file the present petition.
The only question before us is whether the Police Court
had jurisdiction. A habeas corpus proceeding cannot be
made to perform the function of a writ of error and we
are not concerned with the question whether the information was sufficient or whether the acts set forth in the
agreed statement constituted a crime, that is to say,
whether the court properly applied the law, if it be found
that the court had jurisdiction to try the issues and to
render the judgment. Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38;

62, 83; Whitney v. Dick, 202 U. S. 132, 136; Kaizo v. Henry,
211 U. S. 146, 148. This rule has recently been applied
in a case where it was contended in a habeas corpus proceeding that the record should be examined to determine
whether there was any testimony to support the accusation. And this court, affirming the judgment which discharged the writ, said by Mr. Justice Day: "The contention is that in the respects pointed out the testimony
wholly fails to support the charge. The attack is thus
not upon the jurisdiction and authority of the court to
proceed to investigate and determine the truth of the
charge, but upon the sufficiency of the evidence to show
the guilt of the accused. This has never been held to be
within the province of a writ of habeas corpus. Upon habeas corpus the court examines only the power and authority of the court to act, not the correctness of its conclusions." Harlan v. McGourin, 218 U. S. 442.
We come then to the grounds upon which the jurisdiction of the Police Court is assailed. It is urged that the
prohibition contained in the statute under which the information was brought is unconstitutional, in that it violates the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States by depriving the petitioner of liberty and
property without due process of law. The information
rested on § 1177 of the Revised Statutes relating to the
District of Columbia, which makes it a crime "in any
manner" to engage "in any gift-enterprise business" in
the District. If this section'be read alone no basis appears for the argument of invalidity. It cannot be said
that the words "gift-enterprise business" are so uncertain as to make the prohibition nugatory, or that they
necessarily include conduct which lies outside the range
of legislative interference in the exercise of the police
power. While these words are general, they may be regarded as embracing a class of transactions which the
legislature is competent to condemn. Thus a "gift-

enterprise" has been defined to be "a scheme for the division or distribution of certain artidles of property, to be determined by chance, amongst those who have taken shares
Bouvier's Law Dictionary (Rawle's
in the scheme."
Rev.), p. 884; Black's Law Dictionary, p. 539; Anderson's
Law Dictionary, p. 488. See also Lohman v. State, 81
Indiana, 15, 17; Winston v. Beeson, 135 N. C. 271, 279;
Randle v. State, 42 Texas, 580.
But it is said that § 1177 must be read in connection
with § 1176, which in turn has reference to the act of the
Legislative Assembly of the District of Columbia approved August 23, 1871. The argument in substance is
that these statutes furnish a controlling definiton of the
words "gift-enterprise business" as used in § 1177, and
that if this be so, the section must be held unconstitutional.
The act passed in 1871 by the Legislative Assembly of
the District of Columbia, to which reference is made, was
entitled "An act imposing a licefise on trades, business,
and professions practiced or carried on in the District
of Columbia." It provided as follows:
"The proprietors of gift enterprises shall pay one
thousand dollars annually. Every person who shall sell
or offer for sale any real estate or article of merchandise
of any description whatever, or any ticket of admission
to any exhibition or performance, or other place of amuse-,
ment, with the promise, expressed or implied, to give or
bestow, or in any manner hold out the promise of gift
or bestowal, of any article or thing, for and in consideration of the purchase by any person of any other article
or thing, whether the object shall be for individual gain
or for the benefit of any institution, of whatever character,
or for any purpose whatever, shall be regarded as a gift"
enterprise: Provided, That no such proprietor, in consequence of being thus taxed, shall be exempt from paying
any uther taxes imposed by law, and the license herein

required shall be in addition thereto." Laws of the District of Columbia, 1871-72, Part II, pp. 96, 97.
Congress, by act of February 17, 1873, c. 148, 17 Stat.
464, disapproved and repealed this legislation and enacted
the prohibitions which later were incorporated in §§ 1176
and 1177 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District
of Columbia, as follows:
"SEc. 1176. So much of the act of the legislative assembly of the District of Columbia entitled 'An act imposing a license on trades, business and professions, practiced or carried on in the District of Columbia,' approved
August twenty-third, eighteen hundred and seventy-one,
as authorizes gift-enterprises therein, and licenses to be
issued therefor, is disapproved and repealed, and hereafter it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to engage in said business in any manner as defined in said
act or otherwise.
"SEc. 1177. Every person who shall in any manner
engage in any gift-enterprise business in the District
shall, on conviction thereof in the police court, on information filed for and on behalf of the District, pay a
fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or be imprisoned
in the District jail not less than one nor more than six
months, or both, in the discretion of the court."
It will be observed that while §.1176 refers to the Dis,trict act of 1871, and to "gift enterprises" as therein described, it does not treat that description as exclusive.
It assumes that there, are other gift enterprises than those
defined in the act of 1871. It denounces the former not
less than the latter. It does not limit its provisions to
the transactions which previously had been licensed- under the act of 1871, but expressly includes gift enterprises
conducted "in any manner as defined in said act or otherwise."
The purpose of the provision of § 1176 was to disapprove and repeal the former authorization, but not to es-

MATTER OF GREGORY.

Opinion of the Court.

tablish an exclusive definition based upon it. The language of § 1176 conclusively negatives such an intention.
It follows that § 1177 is not controlled by the definition
to be found in the act of 1871. Even if it were assumed
that the condemnation contained in § 1176 of the transactions particularly described in the act of 1871 was too
sweeping, and that Congress went beyond its power in.
giving the prohibition so wide a scope, this would not
affect the provision of § 1177, relating, as we have seen,
to a recognized category of offenses for which it was
within the power of Congress to prescribe punishment.
Whether it be read alone or in the light of its context,
.§ 1177 cannot be adjudged invalid. And it is upon this
section that the information in question was based.
. We have then a statute with valid operation. This
being established there can be no question that it conferred upon the Police Court, by its express terms, jurisdiction of the offense, and that court tried and convicted
the petitioner.
But it is insisted that the facts do not support the conviction. The argument ignores the nature of this proceeding, unless it be meant that no colorable question
was presented; that on the agreed statement of facts
and viewing the statute as prohibiting transactions involving the element of chance, there was such an obvious
and palpable want of criminality that the judicial judgment cannot be said to have been invoked, and that
therefore the court had no jurisdiction to determine
whether or not the statute had been violated.
Such a contention is without merit. 'It is by no means
manifest that the scheme or enterprise in which the petitioner was engaged lay outside the range of judicial
consideration under the statute. On the contrary, the
agreed statement of facts presented questions requiring
the exercise of judicial judgment, and the case falls within
the well-established rule. Given a valid enactment, the

question (assuming it to be one demanding judicial examination) whether a particular case falls within the prohibition is for the determination of the court to which has
been confided jurisdiction over the. class of offenses to
which the statute relates.
As said by Chief Justice Marshall in Ex parte Watkins,
3 Pet. 193, on p. 203: "The judgment of such a tribunal
has all the obligation which the judgment of any tribunal
can have. To determine whether the offence charged in
the indictment be legally punishable or hot, is among
the most unquestionable of its powers and duties. The
decision of this question is the exercise of jurisdiction,
whether the judgment be for or against the prisoner.
The judgment is equally binding in the one case and in
the other; and must remain in full force unless reversed
regularly by a superior court capable of reversing it."
And in Ex parte Parks, 93 U. S. 18, on page 20, the court'
said: "Whether an act charged in an indictment is or is
not - crime by the law which the court administers (in
this case the statute law of the United States), is a question which has to be met at almost every stage of criminal proceedings; on motions to quash the indictment, on
demurrers, on motions to arrest judgment, etc. The
court may err, but it has jurisdiction of the question."
In hearing this application, this court does not sit to
revie w the correctness of the conclusion of the Police
Court as to the Violation of the statute by the petitioner,
or of the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District
as to the sufficiency of the information filed against him.
The question here is not one .of guilt or innocence, but
simply whether the court below had jurisdiction to try
the issues. And as we find that the statute conferred that
jurisdiction the application for a writ of habeas corpus
.must be denied.
Rule discharged and petition dismissed.
