policy was issued until the time of the loss which affected
or related to the property insured. The demurrer was
sustained, but no exception appears to have been taken to
this action of the court. The defendant did not stand
upon his plea, and went to trial upon the merits of the
case, without objection, and introduced evidence upon
other issues in the case, but at the trial no evidence was
offered or introduced on either side relating to the matters
set out in the second plea. Under these circumstances,
we are not required to consider the questions raised by
that plea. On this record we .may fairly assume that the
defendant, at the trial, waived or abandoned the issues
raised by the plea. Garrardv. Lessee of Reynolds, 4 How.

Judgment affirmed.

WILLIAM W. BIERCE, I MITED, v. WATERHOUSE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
HAWAII.

No. 508. Argued December 12, 1910.-Decided January 16, 1911.
This court disapproves of the practice, followed by an intermediate
appellate court in this case, of reversing a judgment on one of
a number of assigned errors without passing on the others; it is
likely to involve duplicate appeals.
Increasing the ad damnum of a suit in replevin to an amount within the
penalty of the bond by amendments to make the declaration conform to the evidence as to value is not, under the laws or practice of
Hawaii, illegal, nor does it have the effect of discharging the sureties.
The surety on a bond given in course of a judicial proceeding is represented in that proceeding by his principal, and becomes responsible,
to the amount of the penalty, for amendments allowed by the court
that do not introduce new causes of action.
A plaintiff suing in replevin is not estopped from showing that he

mistakenly undervalued the property sought to be recovered; and.

limit of his obligation.
in the absence of fraud and collusion the question of value of property
taken under replevin as found in the replevin suit cannot be relitigated in a suit against the sureties on the redelivery bond.
The effect of a petition for rehearing, if duly filed and entertained by
the court, is to prevent the judgment from becoming final and reviewable until disposed of, and when disposed of, an appeal from the
judgment is regulated by the statutes then in force, even if enacted
after the original decision; and so held as to an appeal from the
Supreme Court of Hawaii under the act of March 3, 1905.
Litigants and their sureties are subject to the power of the sovereign
to extend the right of review and appeal pending litigation, and no
fundamental rights are denied or contractual rights of the parties
affected by the exercise of that power.
A redelivery bond is executed subject to such possible changes in the
procedure as do not affect the contract, and under the law of Hawaii,
as amended during the pendency of this litigation, the action against
the sureties was properly brought.
In this case, as the evidence of tender of delivery was not unequivocal,
the question of whether the property was actually restored was for
the jury, and the charge being full and fair, there was no error.
1$ Hawaii, 398, reversed.
THIS was an action for breach of the condition of a redelivery or return bond executed by the defendant to a
certain replevin suit instituted in a Circuit Court for the

Statement of the Case.

The replevin suit referred to was instituted July 20,
1903, by a corporation styled William W. Bierce, Limited,
against Clinton J. Hutchins, trustee, and was for the recovery of certain railway material which had been conditionally sold to the Kona Sugar Company, another corporation. The property of the latter company, including this
material, was acquired at a receiver's sale by Hutchins,
trustee, with notice that the title had been retained by the
Bierce Company, and that the property had not been
paid for. The plaintiff's affidavit (Rev. Laws Hawaii,
§. 2102) stated the value of the material which it was
sought to reclaim at $15,000, and a bond in double that
sum was duly executed with the usual conditions of such
replevin bonds. The defendant Hutchins thereupon, in
order to retain possession of the material claimed, executed a redelivery or return bond under § 2112, Rev. Laws.
Hawaii, being the bond upon which the present action is
based.
The replevin suit resulted, on March 19, 1904, in a judgment for the plaintiff and against the defendant Hutchins,
trustee, for the return Of the property and damages for
its detention, or in default of return, that the defendants
pay the value of the property, which was adjudged to be
$22,000.
Inasmuch as the defense by the surety in the action
upon the return bond referred to grows in part out of matters which were litigated in the replevin suit, we must
state somewhat fully the proceedings in that action. That
case, uport a bill of exceptions, was taken to the Supreme
Court of Hawaii. Certain of the exceptions taken by the
defendant Hutchins were sustained in a judgment rendered January 28, 1905, one of which was that the trial
court had erred in not rendering judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto. See Bierce v. Hutchins, 16
Hawaii, 418 A motion for a rehearing was disposed of in
that court April 29, 1905 (see 16 Hawaii, 717). On May 6,

1905, a judgment was entered reversing the judgment of
the Circuit Court, and remanding the case, with direction
to render a judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.
Thereupon an appeal to this court was allowed, where the
judgment of the Hawaiian Supreme Court was reversed,
for the reasons appearing in the opinion reported in 205
U. S. 340, and the case remanded to that court. Thereupon the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that the defendant Hutchins was then entitled to have a hearing upon
other exceptions not passed upon at the first hearing.
These were therefore heard and overruled. 18 Hawaii,
374. An appeal from that judgment was taken to this
court, and dismissed, as not from a final judgment. 211
U. S. 429.
Pending the review proceedings above referred to the
plaintiff, upon cause shown, obtained a rule on the defendant Hutchins to give a new redelivery bond. Failing in
this an execution issued to recover the property which the
defendant had been directed to return, and for the damage
for detention and costs. These damages, amounting to
$1,050, and the taxed costs were paid and may be dropped
from consideration. The sheriff returned that he was unable to obtain possession of the materials for which the action had been instituted, and therefore, returned the execution unsatisfied.
Pending the review proceedings already stated this action was begun against the Obligors and the executors of
Henry Waterhouse, one of the sureties upon the return
bond given by Hutchins. as stated. Wood, the other
surety, was sued but was not found. Hutchins, for reasons
immaterial, was dropped out. Upon the issue joined there
was a verdict and judgment against the executors of
Waterhouse for $22,000, the value of the property which
the obligor had failed to return as required by the judginent in the replevin suit, that being the value adjudged
in that action, together wit . interest and costs of former

actions not paid, the whole aggregating $28,156.74, for
which there was judgment.
A bill of exceptions was taken from this judgment to'
the Supreme Court of Hawaii, which court, passing over
the great majority of exceptions without. ruling, sustained
one which assigned error in the overruling of the motion
of the defendant below for judgment non obstante veredicto.
The case having been remanded for judgment pursuant to the opinion and mandate, there was a judgment,
notwithstanding the verdict for the defendant. This in
turn was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory,
and the present writ is sued out to review that judgment.
Mr. Frederic D. McKenney, with whom Mr. H enry W.
Prouty was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The lower court erred in ruling that the sureties were
discharged by the amendments of the complaint in the replevin suit, increasing the alleged value of the property
from $15,000 to $22,000. The amendments were properly
made during the course of the trial by leave of court, in
order to make the pleadings correspond with the proofs,
and the ad damnum as increased was within the penalty
of the bond. No new cause of action was introduced by
the amendments, and the liability of the sureties was not
thereby increased. Section 1145, Session Laws Hawaii,

The refusal or failure of the territorial Supreme Court
to pass upon the remaining grounds was equivalent to the
denial or rejection thereof by that court, and in the absence of exception to such denial or rejection by the party

frain from adding to or taking from statutory remedies
theretofore provided for the enforcement of or defense
against such rights and liabilities, if adequate remedy for
such enforcement or the making of defense thereto, shall
remain. Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172; Bronson v.
Kinzie, 1 How. 311.
Whether the suit on the return bond was brought against
the executors prematurely, is solely one of local practice
and procedure which the Supreme Court of the Territory,
in so far as this case is concerned, has approved. Such
matters of local practice and procedure in territorial courts
are not open for review here.
The statute of limitations commences to run as against
a right of action for breach of the conditions of a replevin
or delivery bond from the date of the judgment for a return of the property, which in this case was March 19,
1904 (Rec. 34); Cobbey on Replevin (2d ed.), §§ 1209,

Mr. David L. Withington, with whom Mr. William R.
Castle, Mr. A. W. Greenwell and Mr. Alfred L. Castle were
on the brief, for defendants in error:
The sureties were discharged by the amendments increasing the valuation of the property and the recovery of
judgment for the increased amount.
The foundation of the ancillary proceeding in which the
bond was given was an affidavit in which the plaintiff fixes
the actual value, and the contract was entered into with
reference to the value so fixed. Anderson v. Hapler, 34 Illinois, 436; S. C., 85 Am. Dec. 318; Bardwell v. Stubbert, 17

R. 1. 40.
This is a statutory bond, into which all existing provisions of law enter, including that under which the plaintiff fixes the actual value on which the bond is conditioned.
The sureties can rely upon this statutory provision, and
in order to be bound to an increased value, or by subsequent legislation, the intent of the surety to be bound
must appear on the face of the bond. Sweeny v. Lomme,

The laws in force at the time and place of executing a

If the amendment to the organic act applied, then the
granting of the new right of appeal to another jurisdiction
extended the liability of the surety, exposed him to the
judgment of a court, with reference to which he did not

case, the action was prematurely brought.
The return of the property satisfied the obligation of
the bond; or, if not sufficient to satisfy the bond, the offer
to return, coupled with failure to .accept or reject, discharged the surety. Stevens v. Tuite, 104 Massachusetts,

MR. JUSTICE LURTON, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The right to have this judgment reviewed by this court
involves the review of the judgment upon which the mandate issued, and necessarily brings here the first as well as

332

219 U. S.

the second bill of exceptions and transcript as one case.
As it appears from the first bill of exceptions and the opinion and judgment in that case that the plaintiffs in error
in that case; the defendants in error here, had taken many
exceptions to the judgment against them which were not
passed upon by the Supreme Court of the Territory, it
must follow that if we shall find that that court erred in
'reversing the judgment upon. the single error considered
that the other exceptions and errors not considered are
now open for review, inasmuch as the judgment might
have been reversible for other errors not considered. The
practice adopted by the Supreme Court of the Territory
of passing without deciding other errors assigned upon a
judgment is not approved, since it is likely-to involve
further review proceedings and duplicate appeals. Especially is this so in cases which are subject to the appellate jurisdiction of this court. The single ground upon
which the Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed the judgment
in favor of the Bierce Company and against the executors
of the surety upon the return bond made by the defendants
in the replevin suit was that by two amendments made to
the declaration in the replevin suit the value of the property which the plaintiff sought to reclaim was increased
from $15,000 to $22,000, whereby, as the court below held,
the liability of the sureties was enlarged beyond their
undertaking. The effect of this was held to discharge the
sureties. In this we think thecourt erred.
The plaintiff, to make out its case, introduced in evidence, together with other matters, the pleadings, the
judgment, the return of the sheriff upon the execution for
*a return of the property unsatisfied, and the return bond.
The judgment, as before stated, was for a return of the

Opinion of the Court.

The penalty of the return bond was $30,000. The damages laid in the complaint, as amended, were $28,156.74,
and the judgment in the trial court upon the verdict was
for the full damages claimed.
At the close of all the evidence the defendants moved
the court to instruct a verdict for the defendants. This
motion was based upon several grounds. The principal
one was that the transcript of the record in the replevin
action showed, a, that the plaintiff in that action had
in the affidavit required by § 2102, R. L. Hawaii, executed before the issuance of the writ of replevin, stated the
value of the property claimed to be $15,000; b, that the penalty of the replevin bond was in double this value; c, that
the return bond recited that the value of the property
claimed had been stated in the complaint in the replevin
proceeding to be $15,000; d, that the complaint had been
subsequentlyamended so as to state the actual value to be
$20,000, and a second time amended so as to state the actual value to be $22,000; and that the legal effect of these
amendments. was to release and discharge the sureties.
. The motion for an instructed verdict was overruled and
the case submitted to the jury, who found the actual value
of the property claimed to be $22,000, and for this there
was an alternative judgment, as stated before.
After verdict the defendants moved a judgment non obstante veredicto upon like grounds. This too was denied.
On the appeal of the defendant to the Supreme Court
of Hawaii the action of the trial court in allowing the
amendment of the complaint so as to increase the value
of the property in the manner stated was assigned as error.
Upon this matter the Supreme Court said:
"The only exceptions to rulings prior to the judgment
on which the defendant relied in argument are (1) to allowing the plaintiff to amend its complaint by changing the
averment of the value of the property, first from $15,000
bo $20,000, and then to $22,000 .

"The amendments were properly allowed under the
statute (sec. 1738, R. L.). Before the property was delivered to the plaintiff the defendant obtained a return of
it to himself upon his statutory bond in double the value
of the property as originally stated by the plaintiff. It
does not appear thatthe defendant's rights were affected
by the amendment increasing the value." Bierce v. Hutchins, 18 Hawaii, 511, 522.
This brings us to the proposition as to whether a question thus once litigated and. decided in the replevin suit
is open for relitigation by the surety when sued upon the
return bond. The surety on such a bond given in the
-course of a judicial proceeding is represented in that proceeding by his principal. That the court possessed the
power of allowing an amendment which introduced no
new cause of action is plain. The surety became such in
contemplation of the possible exercise of that power. The
penalty of the bond was not exceeded, and an increase in
the ad damnum did not introduce a new cause of action.
Townsend NationalBank v. Jones, 151 Massachusetts, 454.
By the execution of the bond the surety consented to become responsible to the amount of the penal sum therein
named.
The only possible objection lay in the question as to
whether the plaintiff was estopped from laying the damages in excess of the value of the property stated in the
original complaint or affidavit. There are cases which
hold that in the replevin.action the plaintiff, having himself fixed the value of the property claimed by an affidavit,
is estopped thereby from showing that it is of a less value,
if he failed in his suit, though the defendant may show, if
he can, that it was of a greater value. Washington Ice
Co. v. Webster, 125 U. S. 426. But we are not disposed to
think that a plaintiff in such a suit may not show, especially when, as here, the defendant upon a return bond was
suffered to retain the possession, that he had mistakingly

undervalued the property. We have been cited to no authorities which extend the principle of estoppel to shut'
out such an amendment of the ad damnum clause of the
complaint in a replevin action. However this may be,
the questions were directly in issue in the replevin suit
and decided against the defendant therein.
One who becomes a surety for the performance of the
judgment of a court in a pending case is represented by his
principal and is bound by the judgment against his principal within the limits of his obligation. Washington Ice
Co. v. Webster, 125 U. S. 426, 444, 446; Stovall v. Banks,
10 Wall. 583.
'The issue as to whether the 'value of the property redelivered to the defendants was greater than alleged in
the plaintiffs' affidavit and claimed in the original complaint, as well as whether the amendment of that complaint was such as to change the cause of action, were
issues made and decided against the principal in the bond
upon which the sureties were bound and cannot bb relitigated, in the absence -of fraud and collusion, by a surety
when sued upon the bond. Townsend National Bank v.
Jones, 151 Massachusetts, 454, 459; Greenlaw v. Logan, 2
Lea (Tennessee), 185; Kennedy v. Brown, 21 Kansas, 171;
Hare v. Marsh, 61 Wisconsin, 435; Mason v. Richards, 12
Iowa, 74.
The motion of the executors of Waterhouse in the trial
court for a judgment non obstante veredicto was predicated
upon several distinct grounds. To the action of the trial
court in overruling this motion exceptions were duly taken,
and this action was made the subject of distinct assignments of error upon the writ of error to the Supreme Court
of Hawaii. That court, as we have already seen, considered only such of the grounds relied upon as raised the
question of the effect of the increase of the plaintiff's ad
damnum clause from $15,000 to $22,000. Concluding that
the necessary legal effect of that amendment .of the com-

plaint was to relieve the sureties upon the return bond, it
reversed the judgment and remanded with direction to
give judgment for the said executors, notwithstanding the
verdict against them. See 19 Hawaii, 398.
The learned counsel for the executors have insisted that
if we shall conclude that the action of the Supreme Court
of Hawaii is not to be supported upon the single ground
considered by it, that it is then the duty of this court to
consider the grounds for the motion not passed upon, and
if upon any one of them the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Hawaii may be sustained, its judgment should
not be disturbed. Upon this contention each of the several
grounds upon which such motion was based has been covered by the briefs filed by the present defendants in error.
Among the grounds for a judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, not considered, was, that the. judgment of the
Supreme Court of Hawaii reversing the judgment in favor
of William Bierce, Limited, against Hutchins, trustee, was
final as to the surety upon the return bond, and was not
subject, so far at least as the surety was concerned, to be
reviewed or set aside by any writ of error to this court, and
that the judgment of this court, 205 U. S. 340, reversing
the judgment of the Hawaiian Supreme Court, should not
in anywise affect the present defendants in error as representatives of Waterhouse, one of the sureties upon the
return bond. But the judgment of the Hawaiian Supreme
Court was not final prior to the act of Congress referred to.
It is true that the opinion of the Hawaiian Supreme Court
reversing the judgment of the Hawaiian Circuit Court was
filed on January 28, 1905, a date prior to the act of Congress referred to. But the record shows that thereupon a
petition for rehearing was filed, and that a rehearing was
denied April 29, 1905 (see Bierce v. Hutchins, 16 Hawaii,
717), and that the final judgment, which was reversed by
this court, was not rendered until May 6, 1905, a date
after the law referred to: The effect of the pending peti-

tion for a rehearing, if filed in due time and entertained by
the court, as was the case, was to prevent the judgment
from becoming final and reviewable until disposed of.
Aspen Mining & Smelting Co. v. Billings, 150 U. S. 31;
In re McCall, 145 Fed. Rep. 898. Since, therefore, there
was no final judgment prior to the going into effect of the
act of Congress of March 3, 1905, the pending litigation
was subject to the power of Congress to allow a review
after final judgment, although no such review had theretofore been admissible. No fundamental right was thereby
denied, and the bond must be regarded as having been entered into subject to such change in remedy or procedure
as did not change the contractual rights of the parties.
It is next claimed that this action upon the return"
bond was premature, because started during the pendency
of the defendants' writ of error in the Supreme Court
of Hawaii from the judgment in the replevin case. But
that writ did not annul the judgment. The Hawaiian act
of 1903, ch. 32, §§ 17, 18 and 19, Rev. Laws of Hawaii,
1905, §§ 1861, 1864 and 1865, provided for the issuance of
an execution if the defendant should be ruled to give a
new return bond upon an affidavit of insufficiency. This
was done and the objection of the defendant overruled.
An execution issued, which was duly returned unsatisfied.
The contention that this act of 1903 did not go into force
until after the execution of the Peturn bond has no merit.
Such a bond is always entered into subject to the possibility of changes in tl~e. law of procedure which do not
change the contract. The defendant refused to give the
new bond required and, under the act referred to, an execution was issued, which was returned unsatisfied. This
fact authorized an. immediate suit upon the return bond.
There was no error in holding that the suit was not premature under the act referred to.
Another group of assignments relate to an alleged tender
of redelivery of the property by Hutchins, trustee, after

the judgment requiring a return. The insistence was and
is that there should have been a directed verdict for the
defendant upon the evidence showing such tender and a
rejection by the plaintiff. The letter in evidence making a
tender was not an unequivocal tender. There was also
evidence tending to show the existence of obstacles to a
repossession, which it was the duty of the defendant to
have removed; and also evidence of a conveyance by the
defendant of record, which clouded the title. There was
an absence of evidence tending to show any active exertion to restore the plaintiff's possession, and no evidence
that the plaintiff was ever actually put in repossession.
The question was one for the jury, who found for the plaintiff. The charge was full and fair.
There were a vast number of errors assigned. We have
referred to those .which were either pressed in argument
or have otherwise been deemed of such importance as to
require particular -notice. Those not referred to have been
considered, with the result that we find none
of them well
taken.
The conclusion we reach is that the judgment of the
Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii, reversing the
judgment of the Circuit Court and directing a judgment
non obstante veredicto, was erroneous. The second judgment, affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court upon
its mandate, is also erroneous.
The case must be remanded, with direction to set both
judgments aside and affirm the judgment of the trial court
in favor of the plaintiff William W. Bierce, Limited.
Reversed.
