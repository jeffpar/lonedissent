IN -ERROR TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE STATE

OF

CALIFORNIA.

No. 711.

Submitted January 6, 1911.-Decided February 20, 1911.

As the Forest Reserve provision of the Sundry Civil Act of June 4,
"1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 36, did not prescribe the mrthod which those
entitled to avail of its provision should pursue, it was. competent for
the Secretary of the Interior to adopt the rules and regulations,
which this court has already held to be reasonable and valid, and
entitled to respect and obedience. Cosmos Co. V. Gray Eagle il
Co., 190 U. S. 301.
One not following the rules and regulations adopted by the Land
Department for exchange of lands under the Forest Reserve Act
and not accompanying his relinquishment deed with a proper selection in lieu of the land relinquished, and whose relinquishment was
returned to him by the Department, did not become entitled to a
selection and exchange after the repeal of the act.
Where one attempting to avail of the statutory provision to exchange
under the Forest Reserve Act of 1897 failed to comply with the
rules and regulations of the Land Department, and his relinquishment deed was returned to him, no.contract was created with the
Government which saved him any rights under the repealing act
of March 3, 1905, c. 1495, 33 Stat. 1264.

of the 4eed of relinquishment. Moses Land Co., 34 L. D.
458, holding that title did not pass to the United States
by the recording of the deed and delivery of the same to
the local land officers, does 4ot reach, the gist of the question. While the mere recording of a deed does not operate as a delivery and pass title, where the vendee assents in advance to the transaction the recording does
operate as a delivery and to pass title. Devlin on Deeds,
§§ 262, 269, 287, 291.
When Congress enacted, in the Forest Reserve Act,
that owners of lands might relinquish the same to the
United States and gelect other lands in lieu thereof, it
plainly intended an acceptance of Cvery title so relinqui§hed. See Regulations, June 30, 1897, Rule 16, and
circular of May 9, 1899.
This regulation was mandatory. It required the full
investiture of title in. the United States before a selection
could be made. The regulation was undoubtedly within
the competency of the Land Department. As completely as a private owner could assent-the United States
assented in advance to the delivery to it-of title in every
case, and when the relinquisher recorded his conveyance
he -did so because he had no alternative. Where a convefyance is recorded at the express requirement of the
grantee, it is idle~o speak of lack of delivery; a contract.
was created. 9 Am. & Eng. Ency., 2d ed.; Cosmos Exploration Co. v. G-(My Eagle Co., 190 U. S. 301, distinguished; and see Hyde's Case,-28 L. D. 284.
A ruling that no contract was- created by the relinquishment violates the settled laws of real property. A
contract of exchange is construed exactly as are contracts
of sale, and when one accepts an offer by doing what the
offerer makes a prior condition, the minds of the parties
meet.

being pointed 6ut, will be specifically enforced, as that
which might otherwise be uncertain is made certain by
the act of selecting. Lingeman v. Shirk, 42 N. E. Rep.

Ernshwille v. Tyner, 54 Ohio St. 214.
As to when the right of selection must be exercised,
the act under review is silent. In land grant cases, whenever the railroad company has shown a loss the Land Department has permitted a lieu selection, no matter how
long a time after the loss. Gulf Island R. R. Co. v. United
States, 22 L. D. 560.
The two parties to the contract are the relinquisher
and the United States, not the relinquisher and the land
officials. Their rejection of a selection does not conclude
the question that title did not pass, because, after their
jurisdiction ceases, the courts will announce as a matter
of law whether title will pass. Kern Oil Co. v. Clarke, 30

573; Farnum v. Clarke, 84 Pac. Rep. 168.
Inasmuch as the relinquisher's right to make a lieu
selection vested prior to the repeal, Congress was without power to divest the right; and the action of the Land
Department in cancelling the selection and patenting the
selected land to another was a taking of property without due process of law. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87;

The act of June 4, 1897, 30 siat. 34, extended an invitation to exchange lands. Until the offeree relinquishes
the base land, selects the lieu land, complies with all of
the valid reasonable regulations, and the exchange is approved, there is no change in the legal or equitable status
of either tract, and no obligation arises on either side to
continue with the arrangement. An exchange may be
initiated by filing a deed and selection and in no other

MR. JUSTICE LURTON delivered the opinion of the court.
The question in this case is whether the complainant
below, and appellant here, has acquired, a vested right
to an exchange of a one hundred and sixty-acre tract of
land owned by him and *situated inside the exterior
boundary of a forest-reserve, for a tract of public land
of similar area, by reason of acts done in compliance-with
the terms of that provision of the Forest Reserve Act of
June 4, 1897, providing for such exchanges. .The Supreme
Court of California sustained a demurrer and dismissed his

219 U. S.

bill. 103 Pac. Rep. 844. A writ of error to that court
brings the case here for review as to the Federal question.
That the complainant came within the terms of the
act- of June 4, 1897, there can be no doubt. He owned
one hundred and sixty acres of patented land within the
exterior lines of a public forest reservation, and was entitled to relinquish title to the United States and receive
a patent for one hundred and sixty acres of public land
outside the reservation, to be selected by himself. The

provision of that act conferring this privilege is set out
in the margin, being found in the act of June 4, 1897,
c. 2, 30 Stat. 36.1
The contention is that he' lost his right because he
neglected to make a selection and thereby complete any
exchange until the act extending the privilege was repealed by the act of March 3, 1905, c. 1495, 33 Stat.

1264. The repealing act is set out in the margin.
1 "That

in cases in which a tract covered by an unperfected bona fide
claim or by a patent is included within the limits of a public forest
reservation, the settler or owner thereof may, if he desires to do so, relinquish the tract to the Government, and may select in lieu thereof a
tract of vacant land open to settlement not exceeding in area the tract
covered by his claim or patent; and no charge shall be made in such
cases for making the entry of record or issuing the patent to cover the
tract selected: Provided,further, That in cases of unperfected claims the
requirements of the law respecting settlement, residence, improvements, and so forth, are complied with on the -,3w claims, credit being
allowed for the time spent on the relinquished claims."
2 "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Acts of June fourth,
eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, June sixth, nineteen hundred, and
March third, nineteeni hundred and one, are hereby repealed so far as
they provide for the relinquishment, selection and patenting of lands
in lieu of tracts covered by an unperfected bona fide claim or patent
within a forest reserve, but the validity 6f contracts entered into by the
Secretary of the Interior prior to the passage of this Act shall not be
impaired: Provided, That selections heretofore made in lieu of lands
relinquished to the United States may be perfected and patents issued

ROUGHTON v. INIGHT.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Before the repeal of the act the appellant, in pursuance
of the provisions thereof and of the regulations prescribed
by the Secretary of the Interior, did these things:
He executed a deed of relinquishment to the United
States and caused the same to be duly recorded in June,
1899. He deposited this deed, together with an abstract
of title, in the Land Office of the United States for the
proper district at Visalia, California. This was in June,
1899. It is then averred that the deed and the abstract
were forwarded to the Commissioner of the Land Office
at Washington, and reached there about June 25, 1899,
and were there retained until January 3, 1905, when they
were returned to the Visalia land office for delivery to
the complainant, and were, delivered to him January 9,
f905, and that no objection as to either form or sufficiency
of the relinquishment was made by4 the Commissioner or
any other official of the United States. Thus the matter
stood from January 9, 1905, until March 3, when the
repealing act was passed.
On March 14, 1905, eleven days after the repealing
act, the appellant undertook to make a selection, and for
that purpose filed his application to select the one hundred and sixty acres subsequently patented to the defendant, with notice of the prior selection so made by
complainant. Upon these facts he demanded that a
patent should issue to him for the land so selected, but
the Commissioner and the Secretary of the Interior denied power to issue any such patent, the law having been
repealed before the selection was made.
The issue is a sharp one. The complainant insists that
when lie made and delivered his deed, with an abstract
showing a clear title to one hundred and sixty acres
therefor the same as though this Act had not been passed, and if for
any reason not the fault of the party making the same any pending
selection is held invalid another selection for a like quantity of land
may be made in lieu thereof."

219 U. S.

within a forest reservation, he became entitled to make
a selection of one hundred and sixty acres in lieu thereof
at any time, and that the repeal of the act did not deprive
him of the right to a patent for the land selected on
March 14, 1905. The appellant does not bring himself
within any of the exceptions' to the repealing act. No
selection actually made before the repeal has proven invalid and there was no contract with the Secretary of the
Interior to be saved from impairment, unless the acts referred to constitute in and of themselves such part performance as to constitute a contract with the Secretary
of the Interior. That there was no such contract is evident from a consideration of the charaoter of the exchange
provision and the regulations adopted by the Secretary
of the Interior prescribing the method of carrying out the
act. Upon its face the act is neither more nor less than a
proposal by the Government for an exchange of claims
to land unperfected or lands held under patents situated
within the exterior lines of a forest reservation, for an
equal area of public land subject to entry elsewhere.
The reasons for the provision are found in the disadvantages" which result to such a settler or owner who had
acquired his right before the creation of a reservation
in the public lands surrounding him. He was thereby
isolated from neighborhood association and deprived Of
the advantage of schools, churches and of increasing
value to his own land from occupation by others of the
lands thus devoted to reservation purposes. But the
act did not prescribe the method by which one so situated
might avail himself of the proposal. It was therefore
competent for the Land Department to. adopt rules and
regulations for the administration of the act in this particular, and this was done, and those rules are found in
24 L. D. 592, 593.
In Cosmos Co. v. Gray Eagle, 190 U. S. 301, 3Q9, these

regulations are referred to as reasonable and valid rules,

ROUGHTON v. KNIGHT.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"entitled to respect and obedience." The regulations
which have a bearing here are rules 14, 15 and 16.
To take advantage of the proposal contained in this
act the applicant must select the land he wishes, to receive in lieu and file a sufficient relinquishment of land
within a forest reserve. Manifestly there must be an
acceptance of the relinquishment by some one authorized
td decide upon its sufficiency and an assent to the particular selection made in lieu.
It was not unreasonable that in the administration of
this act the Land Department should limit the authority
of any official to accept a relinquishment. As fax back
as April 14, 1899, the Secretgry of the Interior construed
the act and made the regulations before mentioned. In
Hyde's Case, 28 L. D. 284, he instructed the Commissioner of the General Land Office that "the officers of the
Land Department are not authorized to accept, consider or
pass upon. a relinquishment of the tract within the limits
of a forest .reservation, except in connection with a proffered or tendered selection of other lands in lieu thereof."
In the case*of William S. Tevis, February 28, 1900, 29
L. D. 575, 576, the Secretaxy instructed the Commissioner
in the same terms, saying: Paragraphs 15 and 16 of the
rules and regulations issued June 30, 1897, under said act
(24 L. D. 589, 592), clearly require that in all cases of exchange of. lands under .said act, whether the land relinquished be 'a tract "covered by an unperfected bona fide
claim or by a patent,' an application to select lieu lands
must accompany the relinquishment of the lands within
the limits of a forest reservation."
In a ruling made February 24, 1906, 34 L. D. 458, in
connpction with the application for an exchange, the facts
were nearly identical with those in the present case. The
applicant filed his deed of relinquishment with abstract of
title on January 12, 1905. He made no selection until
March 30, 1905, a date subsequent to the repeal of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

act. The proposal was rejected. Upon a review by the
Secretary the rejection was sustained, upon the ground
that "no contract arises until a selection is made and the
conveyance of the base-tract filed in the Land Department.....
Under the act of June 4, 1897, it is the
filing of the deed in the local land office and the selection
of land in lieu of that relinquished which initiates the
exchange. Until that time the exchange is not initiated
and is merely a purpose in the private owner's mind."
The regulation and practice of the Land Department
in requiring that a deed of relinquishment shall be accompanied by a selection was not unreasonable. The
return to this complainant of his deed of relinquishment
several months before the repeal of the act was obviously
due to his delay in presenting a case for the consideration
of the Department.
That a proposal for an exchange of land within a forest
reservation for lands outside may be withdrawn before
acceptance is an obvious proposition. There having been
no contract in force between this appellant and the Secretary of the Interior at the date of the repeal, he had no
right to save under the exceptions in the repealing act.
There was no error in the judgment of the California
Supreme Court, and it is, therefore,
Affirmed.
