any consideration of the nature of the overt acts alleged."
That the fourth count of the indictment in the case at
bar to which the pleas were directed charged a continuing
conspiracy is manifest. The charge is that the defendants "did unlawfully conspire," etc., "on thefirst day of
September, in the year nineteen hundred and one, and
at the time of the committing of the several overt acts
hereinafter in' this indictment set forth, and continuously
at all times between said first day of September, in the
year nineteen hundred and one, and date of the presenting and filing of this indictment." The indictment also
explicitly charges a continuing object of the conspiracy,
viz., the acquisition of public land within a large area of
country, which was necessarily to be obtained in small
parcels, and the ability to secure which in a great measure
was dependent upon the power of the conspirators from
time to time to procure persons willing to make the tiesired unlawful entries.

HENDRIX v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 319.

Argued November 28, 29, 1910-Decided January 3, 1911.

The United States court at a particular place named is a sufficient
designation of the only court of the United States held at that place,
which has jurisdiction of the case; and an order transmitting a case
under the act .of June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 511, to the United
States court at Paris, Texas, is sufficient to transfer the case to the
District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Texa4

and to give that court jurisdiction.

Where the"record is not here, and the jurisdictional facts are admitted,
and the order recited that the court was well advised in the premises,
this court will not hold that the court to which the case was removed
on petition of plaintiff in error himself did not acquire jurisdiction
because the petition did not state all the jurisdictional facts required by the statute authorizing the removal.
While the repeal of a statute giving special jurisdiction to a court may
operate to deprive that court of the jurisdiction so conferred, the
mere enactment of a subsequent statute which obviates future application of the earlier statute does not amount to its repeal or
affect jurisdiction already acquired.
The provisions of the Oklahoma enabling act of June 16, 1906, c. 3335,
34 Stat. 267,as amended March 4, 1907, c. 2911, 34 Stat. 1287, transferring criminal cases pending in the United States courts of the
Indian Territory to the courts of Oklahoma, did not repeal the act of
June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 511, or affect cases which had already
been transferred under that act to the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Texas.
In this case held that it'was not error for the trial court to refuse to
allow the wife of one accused of murder to testify. Logan v. United
States, 144 U. S. 263.
There was no error on the part of the trial court in denying a motion for
a new trial based on affidavits of some of the jurors that they agreed
to the verdict on the understanding between themselves and other
Jurors that the punishment of the degree found would be less than
that imposed by the court. Mattox v. United ,State8, 146 U. S. 140.

offense so committed, either to suffer death or life imprisonment. Section 563, Rev. Stat. The Circuit Courts
of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction of all
capital cases. Section 629, Rev. Stat., subd. 20.

punishable by death, § 5339, Rev. Stat., and the offense is
no less capital, although the jury by their verdict found defendant guilty as charged "without capital punishment."

The rule that jurors cannot be permitted to impeach

It is clear from the affidavits filed that the jury in this

verdict to carry a greater punishment than that for manslaughter. Unanimity is one of the essential features of
trial by jury; it was so at the common law, and is preserved and protected by constitutional guarantee. Ameri-"

The admission of Oklahoma into the Union as a State
did not abrogate the offense which plaintiff in error had
committed, nor did it deprive the proper court of the
power to proceed with the prosecution to a final judgment.
The statute creating the offense committed by plaintiff
in error was not repealed by the admission of the State
of Oklahoma, which embraced, the territory wherein this
crime was committed. Holt v. United States, 218 U. S.

If the creation of Oklahoma into a State had the effect
of repealing § 5339, Rev. Stat., under which this indictiient was drawn, in so far as it applied to the territory
embraced within said State, yet this offense was kept
alive by § 13, Rev. Stat. United States v. Reisinger, 128

Texas, was the only court which,, after the creation of the

The change of venue was made-on plaintiff in error's

transfer did not exist. Murphy v. Massachusetts, 177

The failure to designate in the order that the case was
removed to the District Court. at Paris was immaterial, as
the statute expressly directed that it was to that court
-alone it could be removed, and it was that court alone
which was vested with jurisdiction to try the same.
Under the statutes directing the enrollment of the
Indians, records -thereof must be kept in the Interior
Department, and the courts will take judicial knowledge
of such records. Knight v. United States Land Asso., 142

The court did not err in refusing to permit Evelina
Hendrix, the "wife of plaintiff in error, to 'testify in his
behalf. Section 858, Rev. Stat., has no application to
criminal trials; rules of evidence in such cases, unless expressly modified by Congress, are those which existed
when the judiciary act of 1789 was pjassed. United States

MR. JusTIcE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
Hendrix was indicted in the United States court in
the Indian Territory for the crime of murder, for. killing
one Roler W. Voss. On his motion the case was transferred for trial to the United States court for the Eastern
District of Texas, at Paris, Texas. The order transferring
the case recited that it was made on the motion of Hendrix,
"the court being well advised in the premises."
On the fourth of March, 1909, in the District Court, he
objected to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground
that the crime was committed in the State of Oklahoma,
and "that under the act of Congress known as the 'Enabling act,' passed June 16, 1906, all criminal cases pending in the United States court within the Indian Territory
were transferred to the district courts of the State of
Oklahoma and of the county of said State where the alleged offense is said to have been committed."
A motion was made to send the cause to such county,
to the end that the offense "be tried in the county and
State where alleged to have been committed, in pursuance
of the Constitution of the United States and the statutes
made in pursuance thereof."
The motion was supported by the affidavit of the attorney of Hendrix, which stated that he was instrumental
in having the cause removed to. Paris, Texas, on account
of the prejudice of the presiding judge of the Southern
District of the Indian Territory, and that "under the
Federal statute permitting said removal to be made, the
same was done by Will Hendrix on my advice and suggestion, especially for the reason before mentioned .
.

HENDRIX v.- UNITED STATES.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The motion was denied. Hendrix was convicted and
sentenced to hard labor for life in the penitentiary of the
United States at Atlanta, Georgia.
A motion for a new trial was made, stating as the grounds
-thereof certain rulings upon evidence, and the action of
the court in denying the motion to transfer the case to
Garvin County, Oklahoma. And the ame grounds constitute the assignments of error in this court.
Another ground is urged in the argument. It is urged
that the District Court at Paris, Texas, did not have jurisdiction of the person of Hendrix because, as it is contended,
the order of the court changing the venue of the case directed it to be transmitted "to the United States court at
Paris, Texas," and did not designate the District Court as
required by the statute. "There were district and circuit
courts," it is said, "for the Eastern District of Texas, at
Paris, Texas, but no court by the name of the 'United
States court.'" And it is asked, "to which of these courts
was this case transferred?" The question is easily answered.
The statute under which the change of venue was made
provides "that whenever a member of the Choctaw and
Chickasaw Nations is indicted for homicide, he may, within'
thirty days after such indictment . .
his affidavit that he cannot get a fair trial,

and it

thereupon shall be the duty of the judge to order a change

Arkansas, or to the United States district court for the
Eastern District of Texas, at Paris, Texas

.

.

June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 511. Reading the order
of the court changing the venue of the case in connection
with the statute, the order is not uncertain. Besides, the
record was transferred and filed :n the District Court at
Paris, Texas, and Hendrix was tried in that court. 'In
other words, the case was removed to the only United
States court at Paris, Texas, designated by the statute,

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

21W U. S.

and tried in the only United States court there in which
it could be tried.
It is further contended that such District Court had
no jurisdiction of the person of Hendrix, because the order
of removal did not recite "the jurisdictional facts or
findings authorizing such change of venue," nor are such
facts or findings shown by the record. That is, it is not
shown that he was a member of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. To both objections it might be immediately
answered that a complete record of the case is not here.
The affidavit upon which the order of removal was made
is not here. It is not denied that an affidavit was filed
as required by the statute, and it may be assumed that
it was sufficient to justify- the action of the court. It is
admitted that Hendrix is an Indian and a member of
the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. The motion for
change of venue was made by him, and could only have
been made by him, and the order recites that the court
granted the motion, "being well advised in the premises."
This means advised by Hendrix in the way provided by
the statute. And it has indubitable confirmation in the
affidavit of his attorney, filed in support of the motion to
send the case back to Oklahoma. It stated that the motioji for removal was made "under the Federal statute permitting said removal to be made."
The inference is palpable that the jurisdictional fact
that Hendrix was an Indian was presented to the court
and constituted its ground of action-action which, we
may say, was imperatively required by the statute.
The next contention of Hendrix is that jurisdiction was
taken from the District Court in Texas by §20 of the act
to enable the people of Oklahoma to form a constitution
and a state government, as amended March 4, 1907. By
that section it was provided that all causes, civil and criminal, pending in the United States courts of Oklahoma
Territory, or in the United States courts in the Indian

HENDRIX v. UNITED STATES.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Territory, at the time those Territories should become a
State, not transferred to the United States Circuit Court
or District Courts in the State of Oklahoma, should be
proceeded with, held and determined by the courts of the
State, with rights of appeal to the final appellate court of
the State and to the Supreme Court of the United States.
And it is provided that "all. criminal cases pending in the
United States courts in the Indian Territory not transferred to the United States circuit or district courts in the
State of Oklahoma shall be prosecuted to a final determination in the state courts of Oklahoma under the law now
in force in that Territory." Maroh .4, 1907, Chap. 2911,
34 Stat. 1286.
The argument is that by certain acts of Congress, explained in In re Johnson, 167 U. S.120, the United States
courts in the Indian Territory were given jurisdiction of
offences committed in the Territory against the laws of
the United States, and that the laws which conferred
jurisdiction on the United States courts held in Arkansas,
Kansas and Texas outside of the limits of the Territory
were repealed. But we have'seen that by § 29 of the act
.ofJune 28, 1898, a change of venue of' cases in the United
States courts of the Territory could be. invoked by a member of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, and that
under the statute the venue of the pending case was, on
the motion of Hendrix, changed to the District 'Court at
Paris, Texas. It is, however, contended that the power
of the court to make the ordef "had been taken away and
repealed by the act of Congress known 'as the 'Enabling
act,' and the State of Oklahoma had been erected and the state courts had succeeded to the jurisdiction. of the
United States courts in the Indian Territory." The 'YEnabling act," it'is urged, "makes no exception or provision
saving cases pending in the United States 'court in the
Indian Territory, nor any -provision saving cases then
pending in any of the United States courts" at Paris,

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

Texas, or in the Eastern District of Texqs, on change of
venue, and, therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to
try Hendrix. To support the contention it is argued
that when the jurisdiction of a cause depends upon a
statute the repeal of the statute takes away the jurisdiction and causes pending at the time fall, unless saved by
provision of the statute. Many cases are cited to support
the proposition and other cases to sustain the view that,
"if an act conferring jurisdiction is repealed, without
reservation as to pending cases, they fall with it." The
effect would have to be admitted if the imputed cause
existed. The act of June 28, 1898, under which the change
of venue was brdered, was not repealed. The conditions
of its future application, of course, disappeared with the
admission of the State into the Union, but what had been
done before that time was not abrogated, nor was the
statute repealed. It had performed its office as to the
pending case, but even if we should consider it necessarily
as a continuing power, not completely fulfilling its purpose
by the transfer simply of a case from one court to another,
we cannot regard it as having been repealed nor that
jurisdiction had been taken from the District Court at
Paris, Texas. The "Enabling act" provides only for
the transfer of cases to the courts of Oklahoma which
*ere pending in the District Court 'of the Territory of
Oklahoma and in the United States courts of Indian Territory. That this case was so pending was the conception
of counsel when the motion was made to transfer it to the
District Court of Garvin County, Oklahoma, and the same
conception is expressed in the argument. And it is necessary to meet the words of the enabling act, which embraced, a's we have seen, only cases pending in the'courts of
Oklahoma and Indian Territories. The foundation of the
conception seems to be that the venue of the case was not
legally changed to the Disfrict Court at Paris, Texas,
and that it was still pending in the United States court in

HENDRIX v. UNITED STATES.
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the Indian Territory when the enabling act was passed
and was transferred by the act to the courts of the State.To this operation of the act we cannot assent. The act
is explicit in its terms and provisions. It was -careful in
its accommodations for the new conditions-the change
of the Territories into a State, and in the adjustments
made necessary by the creation of new jurisdictions,
state and Federal. There was no such necessity for cases
transferred to other jurisdictions still adequate to dispose
of them. The contention is therefore untenable.
It is assigned as error that the wife of Hendrix was not
allowed to testify in his behalf to certain matters which,
it is contended, were "vitally material to his defense."
The ruling was not error. Logan v. United States, 144
U. S. 263.
On the motion for new trial affidavits of four jurors
were offered, stating with some detail that they did not
understand the legal effect, of the verdict. Only one of
the affidavits is in the record. The maker states that,
by finding the defendant guilty, as charged in the indictment, without capital punishment, "he did not understand what the punishment would be on such a verdict,
and agreed to it on the understanding that the punishment would only be two years in the penitentiary." He
further states that he was in favor of a verdict for marslaughter, and would never had consented to the verdict
had he thought or believed it "would carry with it a life
penalty." The'motion for new trial, as we have said, was
denied. We see no error in the ruling. Mattox v. United
States, 146 U. S. 140.
