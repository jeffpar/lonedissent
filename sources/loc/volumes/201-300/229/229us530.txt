CAMP v. BOYD.
APPEAL FROM

THE COURT

OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT

OF COLUMBIA.

No. 71.

Argued February 28, March 3, 5, 1913.-Decided June 9, 1913.

Parties in possession of land under titles from various sources and having the equitable, as well as the legal, title to a portion of it and the
equitable, but not the legal, title to the remainder, may, under the
circumstances of this case, properly invoke the aid of equity to restrain other parties from maintaining ejectment suits and to adjudicate the title to the entire tract in a single suit.
A court of equity ought to do justice completely and not by halves.
As a court of equity should prevent multiplicity of suits, it may, to
this end, if obliged to take cognizance of a suit for any purpose retain it for all purposes even though required to determine purely
legal rights otherwise beyond its authority.
While a term, such as "ground rents," used in a conveyance may not
be the recognized equivalent of any legal estate in lands, the court
may ascertain the recognized meaning given to it and resort to that
as evidence of the intent of the parties using it and thus determine
what effect ought in equity to be given to it.
The term "ground rents" as used in the deeds and proceedings involved
in this case did not import merely the rents that were to accrue during
the residue of a 99 year lease renewable forever, but included the
reversion as well, it appearing that the entire beneficial interest of
the owner of the ground rents and the reversion was undoubtedly
the subject of the sale and within the contemplation of the buyer
and seller.
Deeds made by a public officer in pursuance of a decree of the court
which are defective in form by reason of a mistake made by such
public officer will pass the title to the property intended to be conveyed, as harniful consequences should not fall upon purchasers,
who, in reliance upon apparent regularity have paid their money
for the property.
Equity regards that as done which ought to be done. It looks to the
true intent ond meaning, rather than to the form. It relieves of
consequences of accident and mistake as well as fraud.

TiiE facts, which involve the title, legal and equitable,
to certain real estate in the City of Washington, District
of Columbia, are stated in the opinion.

was on the brief, for appellant.

Mr. John B. Larmer and Mr. R. Ross Perry, Jr., were on

MR.

JUSTICE

PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Appeals
of the District of Columbia, affirming a decree of the
Supreme Court, establishing the title of the complainants,
(now appellees) to a lot of land in the City of Washington,
and granting a perpetual injunction against the further
prosecution of an action of ejectment that was brought
by the appellant, Joseph Parker Camp, against Caleb C.
Willard, the devisor of the complainants, to recover possession; and also enjoining Camp and -all persons claiming
under him from instituting any further proceedings at
law or in equity for the possession of, or for asserting any
claim to, the land. The cause was heard in the Supreme
Court upon a demurrer to the bill of complaint, which was
overruled (37 Wash. Law Rep. 14); and the defendant
having elected to stand upon his demurrer, a final decree
followed as of course. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reported 38 Wash. Law Rep. 374; 35 App. D. C.
159.
Both parties claim under Samuel Blodget, Jr., who
owned the property in the early days- of the Federal
Capital. The bill of complaint sets forth the full history
of the title, with copies of the instruments of conveyance
and other documents necessary to a complete under-

O(CTOBER TERM1, 1912.

229 U. S.

standing of the controversy. All the facts hereinafter
stated res)ecting the title are derived from the averments
of the bill and from the documents filed with it and by
reference made parts of it.
The property in question is described as-"Original lot
numbered Twenty, in Square numbered two hundred and
fifty four, in the City of Washington, in the District of
Columbia, as the same is laid down on the ground plan or
map of said city." This square is bounded by E and F
Streets, and by 13th and 14th Streets, in the Northwest
section; Lot No. 20 being on the southerly side of F
Street.
Under the act of Congress entitled-" An act for establishing the temporary and permanent seat of the Government of the United States," passed July 16, 1790 (1 Stat.
130, C. 28), three Conmissioners were appointed by
President Washington, and they in the following year
made a friendly agreement with the original land-holders,
which resulted in laying out the city in squares and streets,
and the subdivision of the squares; and, in the year 1792,
a partition of the lands was made between the original
proprietors and the Commissioners. In that division this
lot was amongst those set off to the Cormnissioners, and it,
with some adjoining lots, was sold by them to Blodget in
the same year. But no conveyance was made to him, and
he therefore acquired only an equitable interest.
Blodget about that time organized a lottery under the
sanction of the Commissioners, and advertised it as done
"By the Conuilssioners appointed to prepare the public
buildings, &c., within the City of Washington for the reception of Congress, and for the permanent residence after
the year 1800." It was announced as "A lottery for the
improvement of the Federal City." It was stated that
the sole design of the lottery was to facilitate other improvements together with the public buildings. The
capital prize announced was-"One superb hotel, with

CAMP v. BOYD.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

baths, outhouses, etc., etc., to cost fifty thousand dollars,"
with cash prizes -aggregating $300,000 in addition. The
advertisement stated that "The keys of the hotel, when
complete, will be delivered to the fortunate possessor of
the ticket drawn against its number," and that " One
hundred dollars will be given for the best plan of an elegant
and convenient hotel or inn, with hot and cold baths,
stable," etc. The advertisement ivas subscribed "S. Blodget, Agent for the Affairs of the City." Large sales of
tickets having been made by Blodget, and by Colonel
William Deakins, Jr., who appears to have been his partner in the scheme, and some time having elapsed without
a drawing being made, the Commissioners became uneasy
because of their real or supposed responsibility for the
prizes, whereupon Blodget and Deakins gave them a
written declaration under seal, dated September 20, 1793,
agreeing to indemnify the Commissioners from all claims
and demands by reason of any prize to be drawn. Afterwards, and at the request of the Commissioners, Blodget,
who appears to have been a large land owner in the I)is-trict, made a mortgage or deed of trust, under date of
January 28, 1794, to Thomas Johnson, Jr., and Thomas
Peter, as Trustees, for securing the payment of the prizes
and for the indemnity of Thomas Johnson, David Steuart,
and Daniel Carroll, the Commissioners, their successors,
etc. By the mortgage, Blodget transferred in fee to
Thomas Johnson, Jr., and Thomas Peter--" all the lands
and real estate and property of him the said Samuel
Blodget situate and being within the Territory of Columbia, with their

.

.

.

appurtenances, and all the estate,

right, title, etc., in law and in equity" of Blodget therein.
The defeasance clause provided that Blodget should ' pay
all prizes and sums of money -with which he is or may be
chargeable, or for which he may be liable for or on account
of the said lottery, and shall in all things save, indemnify
and keep harmless the said Thomas Johnson, David

Steuart and Daniel Carroll; their successors, etc., against
all suits," etc.
Thereafter, and in the year 1801, Blodget made three
leases of as many several parcels of Lot 20. The lot has a
frontage of 51 feet 11 inches upon the southerly side of
F Street, and a depth of 159 feet running to an alley. One
lease was dated April 13, 1801, and demised to James
Daugherty the easterly portion of the whole lot, having
a frontage of 20 feet upon the street, and running the. full
depth to the alley; the second lease was to Edward Frethy,
dated April 14, 1801, and covered the westerly portion
of the lot, having a frontage of 19 feet 112 inches and
running of that width to the alley; the third lease, covering
the intervening portion of the whole lot, having a frontage
of 11 feet 11 inches on the street, and running the full
depth, was dated April 15, 1801, and made to Edward
Fennell. The Daugherty and Frethy leases were recorded
within the year. The Fennell lease, for some reason, was
not promptly acknowledged or recorded, and therefore a
new lease was made by Blodget to Fennell, dated April 20,
1804, and recorded a few days later. These leases all ran
for ninety-nine years from their respective dates in 1801,
the terms, however, "to be renewable forever." They
were sealed instruments, elaborate in form, signed and
acknowledged by lessor and lessee-in each instance, and
recorded in the Land Records of the District of Columbia.
A copy of the Daugherty lease is set forth in the margin.

payable annually, with an option of purchase in fee at the
price of $500; the Frethy lease was the same in these respects; the Fennell lease called for a rent of $24 per annum
and a purchase price of $300. The leases were alike in
that they provided for terms of 99 years each, with a
right of perpetual renewals; with right of reitry by the
lessor for 40 days' default in payment of the rent, or distress at his option; two of them provided that for 60 days'
default in the payment of the rent the lessor might reenter
and terminate the lease; each lease contained an option
for a purchase in fee at a price of which the annual rent
was equivalent to 8%; each required the lessee to erect a
dwelling house upon the premises during the year of the
making of the lease. The Fennell lease differed in containing no provision for forfeiture of the term on nonpayment of the rent, and in some minor particulars.
In October, 1802, one Robert S. Bickley began suit
against Samuel Blodget and others by bill in Chancery in
the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, setting
up the history of the above-mentioned lottery; the public
advertisement of the scheme; that Bickley, in reliance
upon the proposed plan, purchased a ticket; and that the
sale and disposal of the tickets was intrusted wholly to
Blodget and to William Deakins, Jr., since deceased. The
bill set out the making of the indemnity agreement of
September 20, 1793, by Blodget and Deakins, and the
making of the mortgage by Blodget on January 28, 1794,
to Thomas Johnson, Jr. (since deceased), and Thomas
Peter (still surviving), covering all the lands of Blodget
within the Territory of Columbia. That he, Bickley,
drew as a prize the "'Superb Hotel with baths, outhouses,
&c., &c., to cost fifty thousand dollars," as offered and
promised in the advertisement, plan and scheme; " that
the said hotel has never been finished and the keys thereof
delivered to your orator as by the said scheme and plan
of the lottery he was assured and promised it should be."

O(CT()BER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

That in the year 1798 he, Bickley, instituted a suit at law
in the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, against Blodget, to recover damages by reason of
his breach of undertaking; that this suit being at issue,
and a jury impanelled to try the issue joined therein, it
was mutually agreed between Bickley and Blodget, with
the leave of the court, that the jury should be discharged
from giving their verdict, and should be empowered to
act as referees, to determine and order what sum of money,
if any, should be paid by Blodget to Bickley, and if they
thought proper, to order titles and conveyances and other
acts by either party to the other as justice should require;
whereupon the jury as referees awarded that Blodget
should convey to Bickley, in fee simple, the hotel and the
lots of ground belonging to it, and should also pay to
Bickley the sum of $21,500 with costs, for the payment of
which, and the performance of the award, the property
in the City of Washington mortgaged by Blodget to the
Commissioners was by the terms of the award to be first
resorted to; that upon the report of the jury as referees
the court gave judgment in favor of Bickley against
Blodget, for said sum of $21,500 and costs, and that the
report of the jury as referees should be in all its other
parts confirmed and carried into full and complete execution. That by virtue of the deed of trust of January 28,
1794, all the real property which Blodget had within the
limits of the Territory of Columbia was pledged and made
answerable to make good to the fortunate adventurers the
prizes they should draw in the lottery, and "that your
orator has his claim to be paid out of that property still
further confirmed by the award and the judgment hereinbefore set forth." The bill then set forth that the "lands
and real estate and property" of Blodget situate within
the Territory of Columbia "as well in law as in equity, as
by the said deed is expressed, consisted of," etc., following
with a detailed enumeration of many tracts and parcels

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of land, among which is-"the following property which
the said Blodget purchased of the said Commissioners at
the times hereinafter mentioned, which being fully paid
for by the said Blodget, certificates in due form have
regularly issued therefor, but the Commissioners meaning
to hold the same as security to themselves and to the
fortunate adventurers in the said lottery, have not delivered the same -to the said Blodget or caused them to be
recorded, but whilst they remained in office held the same,
and when they went out of office the same fell into the
hands of Thomas Munroe, Superintendent of City Affairs,
who now holds them, that is to say, Lots numbered
twenty and twenty-one in square 254 in the said City, sold
to the said Blodget on the 8th day of October, 1792," etc.,
etc. The bill specified by lot and square numbers those
lots that had been appropriated by Blodget for the hotel,
averring that the legal title to some of them was in Munroe, Superintendent for City Affairs, certain of them having been conveyed by Blodget to the Commissioners,
others having remained in their ownership, and the legal
title to the remainder being in Blodget. Sundry deeds of
conveyance made by Blodget to various purchasers for
portions of the lands covered by the deed of trust were
then set forth. In this connection the leases made by
Blodget to Daugherty and Frethy, respectively, in April,
1801, for parcels of lot No. 20 in Square 254, were set out,
and these lessees were made parties defendant. The Fennell lease was not mentioned, apparently because it was
not upon record at the time of the filing of th6 bill. The
prayer was, that Blodget might be required to convey to
Bickley the hotel with the lots pertaining thereto; that
Munroe as Superintendent of the City should be compelled to convey to Bickley that portion of the lots pertaining to the hotel of which he held the certificates; and
that the residue of the property set forth in the bill of
complaint, or somuch thereof as necessary, should be sold

to pay the money adjudged to Bickley by the award and
judgment in the Pennsylvania suit.
Annexed to this bill of complaint as exhibits were copies
of the deed of trust of January 28, 1794, a transcript
of the proceedings in the Pennsylvania suit, and other
documents sustaining and supplementing the averments
of the bill. Among the parties named as defendants
were Blodget, Thomas Munroe, Superintendent for City
Affairs, Frethy, Daugherty, and other grantees of Blodget.
Frethy was served with process and filed an answer setting
up that he had assigned his lease to one Betz. Daugherty
being a non-resident, notice appears to have been published against him. Blodget answered, admitting in
part and denying in part the averments of the bill. Annexed to the answer was a formal admission of "the execution of the various exhibits at this time filed by complainant, and that they may be read in evidence." Thomas
Munroe, as Superintendent of the City of Washington,
filed an answer admitting the principal averments of the
bill and setting up that he, as Superintendent, had in
his hands the certificates of sale evidencing Blodget's
purchases of various lots from the former Commissioners;
that the Commissioners had withheld the certificates
from Blodget's possession "as security for the fortunate
adventurers in the said lottery who should have claims
against the said Blodget." Lot 20 in Square 254 does not
appear among the lots enumerated in this connection.
Thomas Peter, the surviving trustee under the mortgage
or deed of trust of January 28, 1794, does not appear
among the parties named as defendants in the original
bill filed by Bickley, but he filed an answer admitting
the execution of that deed, and that it was made at the
instance of the then Commissioners of the City of Washington to secure the punctual payment of the prizes drawn
in the lottery therein mentioned; and-"That this defendant knows not what property is included or compre-

hended by the said deed, but this defendant further answering admits that whatever property he does hold in
virtue of the said deed is held by him in trust for the purposes in the said deed mentioned and subject to any
order or decree which this Honorable Court shall make
respecting the same." Thereafter, Peter seems to have
been treated as a party defendant. On September 24,
1804, a written stipulation was filed in the cause, signed
br the respective solicitors for complainant and for the
defendant Blodget, in the following terms: "It is agreed
by the complainants and the defendants in this cause,
by their solicitors, that a decree shall pass immediately
by consent for conveying to the complainant the hotel
and the lots appropriated for the same. That the execution and truth of all the exhibits referred to in and by
the complainants is hereby admitted, all form as to the
of (sic) proceeding waived. This admission in no wise
to give validity or authenticity to the award obtained in
the court of Pennsylvania or the judgment thereon rendiered, but that is to stand on its own merits unaffected
by this agreement. This cause set down by consent for
hearing at the next term." An interlocutory decree was
made accordingly, under date October 1, 1804, requiring
Blodget and Thomas Peter to convey to Bickley, Lot 1
in Square 430, with the buildings and improvements
thereon, and requiring Munroe, as Superintendent, to
convey and assure to Bickley Lots 1, 2, 3,' 4, and 5 in
that square; and retaining the cause as to all other property nd as to all other objects and purposes mentioned
in the bill. October 4, 1805, a further decree was made,
requiring the defendant Blodget to pay to the complainant, Bickley, on or before a date in November, the amount
of the-debt due to him, being the sum of $26,635.13, besides
costs, and decreeing that on failure thereof certain designated sections and lots of ground, situate in the City of
Washington, or so much thereof as should be sufficient

to raise and pay the said several sums of money, should
be sold, and it was further decreed "that certain ground
rents reserved by the said defendant Blodget, by indenture
made between the said Blodget, of the one part, and Edward Frithey, one of the defendants, of the other part,
bearing date on the 4th day of April 1801, and certain
other ground rents reserved by the said Samuel Blodget
by indenture made between the said Samuel Blodget of the
one part, and James Daugherty, one of the said defendants,
of the other part, bearing date on the 13th day of April,
1801, be also sold for the purposes aforesaid." Daniel
Carroll Brent was appointed trustee for making the sale.
He was directed to sell the property at public auction,
after advertisement, report the sale to the court, and
upon confirmation of it, and payment of the purchase
money, "the said trustee by a deed or deeds good and
operative in law, etc., shall give, grant, bargain and sell,
release and confirm to the respective purchasers and their
heirs respectively all the right, title and interest therein
which was or is in the said Samuel Blodget, and all the
right, title or interest.therein which the said Thomas Peter
derived in and thereto by virtue of the deed in the said
bill of complaint mentioned (referring to the deed of
trust of January 28, 1794) ....
and the purchaser
or purchasers respectively, and their respective heirs,
shall thereupon hold the same by them respectively purchased free, clear and discharged from all claims of the
said Samuel Blodget and of the other defendants." It
was further decreed that the defendant Thomas Peter,
upon the request of the trustee, should join and become a
party in and to all deeds to be executed by the trustee in
virtue of this decree; and that in all cases where the outstanding legal title remained in Thomas Munroe as Superintendent, he, Munroe, should at the request of the trustee,
join in and become a party to the deed. "And lastly, as to
all the property in the said bill of complaint mentioned,

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and as to all the objects of the said bill not in and by this
decree specially and particularly decreed upon, this
cause isretained for further proceedings hereafter to be
had thereupon, and for that purpose is ordered to be continued."
Brent accepted the appointment as trustee, gave bond,
and, after advertisement, made a public sale of the property. The notices, after describing many tracts of land
by lot and square numbers, contained the following: "Also
several certain ground rents reserved by said Blodget,
amounting in the whole to eighty dollars per annum."
His report of sale was made under date of January 21,
1806. It mentions "Ground Rent on James Daugherty's
lease" as sold to Henry Pratt for $360, and "Ground
Rent on Edward Frithy's lease" as sold to Robert F.
Howe for $400. No mention is made of the remainder of
Lot 20 in Square 254, nor of the ground rent on the Fennell
lease. By decree made under date June 25, 1806, the
report was approved and the sales confirmed (with an
exception not now material), and it was ordered that the
proceeds of sale, after paying expenses, taxes, etc., be
paid over to complainant towards the discharge of the
moneys theretofore decreed to be due from the defendant
Blodget to him. It further appears that the purchases
made by Pratt (including the Daugherty ground rent)
were made for the' benefit of Bickley, the complainant;
and Pratt assigned his bids to Bickley, October 31, 1806.
Brent reported this to the court and asked for leave to
make deeds for the Pratt purchases to Bickley, and the
court accordingly made an order that Brent, together
with Thomas Peter and Thomas Munroe, should convey
to Bickley all the property purchased by Pratt at the sale.
Pursuant to these proceedings, Brent, Trustee, Thomas
Peter, and Thomas Munroe, Superintendent, etc., joined
in a deed dated April 3, 1807, to Bickley, reciting the
decree of October 4, 1805, ordering among other things

"that sundry squares, lots and portions of ground and
ground rents in the said City of Washington" be sold,
reciting the advertisement and sale made in pursuance
thereof, and that at the sale certain lots particularly mentioned "And the ground rent reserved by the said Samuel
Blodget by Indenture made between him and James

conveying certain of the lands described in the deed, but
not the "ground rents" in question.
By indenture dated January 15, 1807, Daniel C. Brent,
Trustee, and Thomas Peter conveyed to Robert F. Howe
the property "purchased by the latter at the trustee's

thereunder, and that "among other property and ground

Peter and Thomas Johnson, Jr., since deceased, bearing

On May 28, 1810, a supplemental bill was filed, reciting
that the sale made by Brent had fallen short of paying the
money decreed to be due to Bickley, and that he had lately
discovered other property not included in the former bill
and decree, consisting of sundry lots particularly described,
and-" That the said Samuel Blodget was also on the
said 28th day of January, in the year 1794, seised and
possessed of and entitled to sundry lots in the said City,
which he afterwards let on ground rent, reserving an
annual rent for the said property, to divers persons hereinafter particularly set forth, which tenants your petitioner
does not wish to disturb or interfere with, but wishes to
leave them in the quiet enjoyment of their leases under
the said Blodget, under the terms and conditions expressed
in the said leases respectively, but wishes and prays of
this court to direct the ground rents reserved thereon,
and the reversionary interests of the said Blodget therein,
whatsoever the same may be, to be sold for the benefit
of your petitioner, which lots so leased on ground rent
are as follows, to wit, eleven feet, eleven inches more or
less fronting on F Street, North, extending in depth one
hundred and fifty-nine feet to an alley, being part, of:Lot
No. 20 in Square No. 254, leased to a certain Edward Fennell, his Executor &c., for a term of years renewable
from time to time forever, reserving the quarterly rent
of twenty four dollars payable to the said .Bodget."
Several other like leases are mentioned, and this averment follows-"To all of which ground rents -the said
Blodget now claims title, and is in the actual receipt
thereof." The prayer was for a sale of the property
thus mentioned, to raise the balance due to complainant.

Blodget answered, admitting the facts stated in the supplemental bill, with an exception not now material, and
stating that he had no objection to a decree as prayed.
A decree was made accordingly, under date November 5,
1813, and Washington Boyd was appointed trustee to
make the sale. Some years later he made a report of
sale in writing, and afterwards represented to the court
that in consequence of ill health he would be required
to leave the District for some time, and requested the
court to appoint some other person to make conveyances,
suggesting John Davidson for this purpose. The court
appointed Davidson accordingly.
By indenture dated May 8, 1818, Davidson, as such
Trustee, conveyed to Charles Glover, in consideration of
$405.50, "all the interest claim and right of the said
Samuel Blodget" in certain lots sold by Boyd as Trustee,
pursuant to the decree of November 5, 1813, and, among
others, "part of Lot twenty, in square two hundred and
fifty four, fronting eleven feet eleven inches on north F
Street, leased to Edward Tennell (sic) for ninety nine
years, renewable forever, under the annual ground rent
of twenty four dollars."
This completes the recital of the proceedings in the
Chancery suit of Robert S. Bickley against Samuel Blodget
and others, and of the sales and conveyances made pursuant to the decrees therein, so far as they pertain to the interest of'Blodget in the land now in controversy. We proceed to a statement of the subsequent transfers, so far as
necessary for a determination of the questions presented.
By indenture dated May 1, 1813, Bickley, in consideration of $400, conveyed to James Daugherty, his heirs and
assigns, "all that part of Lot No. 20 in Square No. 254,
fronting on F Street North, twenty feet" which was leased
by Blodget to Daugherty. The deed mentions the date
of the lease, and recites that "all the estate, interest and
claim of the said Samuel Blodget in and to the said part

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of a lot and premises, was afterwards sold and conveyed
by Daniel C. Brent as trustee, under a decree of the said
Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County
of Washington to the said Robert S. Bickley." This deed
contained a covenant of general warranty.
Assuming the above-mentioned deed from Brent
Trustee, and others to Bickley had the effect to vest in
Bickley all the reversion that was in Blodget, subject to'
the Daugherty lease, this deed from Bickley to Daugherty
brought about a merger of the leasehold and the reversion.
By mesne conveyances, all of Daugherty's interest came
to be vested in one Benjamin F. Isherwood in the year
1852.
As already pointed out, the ground rents under the
Frethy lease were, conveyed by Brent, Trustee, and
Thomas Peter, by deed dated January 15, 1807, to Robert
F. Howe. It appears that Frethy had assigned his lease
to one Frederick Betz, by recorded deed, dated September 19, 1801; Frederick Betz assigned it to George Betz
by recorded deed of January 24, 1803; and George Betz
assigned it to John Thorp by recorded deed of February 15,
1804. Each of these instruments transferred all right and
interest of the assignor in the land, describing it by measurements and abuttals, and referring to the lase thereof
made by Blodget to Frethy for "ninety-nine years, renewable forever."
It is admitted that William Dowling probably succeeded
to the ownership of this leasehold by an unrecorded assignment of Thorp's interest. Dowling claimed in a deed made
by him to Robert F. Howe, presently to be mentioned,
that he was the owner of the leasehold interest.
In 1830 the corporation of the City of Washi,ngton
made a tax deed to Dowling for "Part of Lot 20 and the
improvements in Square 254" for unpaid taxes assessed
against it "as the property and in the name of Robert F.
Howe," for the years 1819.to 1824, inclusive. Dowling,

by a deed made in 1831, reciting this tax title, conveyed
to Howe and his heirs "all the right, title, interest, and
estate of him, the said William Dowling,", in the part of
the lot conveyed to him by the tax deed, "except the
leasehold right belonging to him in the same," the deed
declaring it to be the intention of the parties "that the
said William is not to surrender his leasehold interest in
the said part of lot and premises." Robert F. Howe, by
his will, dated in 1830, authorized his executors to sell all
his estate for the purpose of paying certain legacies, and
thereafter his executors, by deed dated in 1835, conveyed
this plot to William Dowling, the deed reciting that
Robert F. Howe "held under a deed of conveyance to
him from Daniel C. Brent, Trustee, and Thomas Peter,
made the fifteenth day of January, in the year of our
Lord 1807," and that at the time of the making of that
deed the property "was subject to a lease for ninety-nine
years, renewable forever," as will appear "by reference
to an indenture of lease dated April fourth, 1801, and
recorded," etc.
Under the will of William Dowling, and by mesne conveyances thereafter, whatever estate Dowling had in this
parcel became vested in Benjamin F. Isherwood in the
year 1865.
As already pointed out, the ground rents of the Fennell
lease-for the word Tennell in the deed is obviously a
mistake--became vested in Charles Glover; but that deed
likewise included "all the interest, claim and right" of
Blodget in that part of Lot 20 that was covered by the
Fennell lease; thus evidently conveying the reversion.
The bill avers that this part of Lot 20 was conveyed by
Abraham Bradley's heirs to Benjamin F. Isherwood in
1852. It does not appear when or how (if at all) Fennell's
leasehold became merged in the reversion. Nor does it
seem to be material, for if not merged, it lapsed on the expiration of the 99-year term and failure to renew, and this

before the ejectment suit was commenced. Respecting
this parcel, the contention of appellant is, that the bill of
complaint of the appellees shows no reason for equitable
relief, because, if they have the title they claim to have, it
is a sufficient title to constitute a good defense to an action
at law.
Whatever interests Benjamin F. Isherwood may have
acquired by the above-mentioned conveyances in the
several portions of Lot 20 admittedly became vested in
Caleb C. Willard, the devisor of the appellees, in or about
the year 1882.
On the other hand, whatever reversionary rights (if
any) remained in Samuel Blodget have admittedly become
vested in the appellant.
The bill of complaint herein avers that the defendant,
now appellant, claims to be the assignee of the heirs-at-law
of Blodget; and that he claims that after the execution of
the leases thure remained in Blodget and his heirs a reversion in fee in Lot 20; that only a rent-charge passed under
the proceedings in Bickley v. Blodget; that as the leases
have expired without purchase or renewal by the lessees
the reversion has come into possession, and that therefore
as plaintiff in ejectment he has the right to recover possession and title in fee simple.
These contentions are in fact made here in behalf of the
appellant with respect to so much of Lot 20 as was- leased
to Daugherty and to Frethy respectively.
As to the Fennell lot, it is insisted that by the very language of the supplemental bill in the Bickley suit, and the
decree for sale made pursuant to it, and the terms of the
deed made by Davidson, Trustee, thereunder, the purchaser acquired a legal title to the reversion, and not
merely to the, ground-rents; and that therefore, on the
theory that the averments of the bill are true, the appellees
have an absolute fee simple title to the Fennell lot, such
as to constitute a plain, adequate and complete defense

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

to the ejectment suit. And it is pointed out that under
the local practice (Code D. C., §§ 993, 1000) defendants
may separately defend as to that pareel.
The question for decision, therefore, is whether the
appellees have a good title as against the appellant; and,
if so, whether the nature of their title is such as to render
it unavailable at law and to require the intervention of a
court of equity for their relief against appellant's claims.
It is suggested, rather than urged, as a ground of equitable jurisdiction, that because Blodget never received a
deed of conveyance from the Commissioners for Lot 20
in Square 254, his title was never more than an equitable
title; and that since both parties claim under him, the
controversy is a matter proper for the cognizance of a
court of equity, whatever be the grounds of controversy
as between the parties. We doubt whether this view is
tenable. There is no question that Blodget, and those
claiming under him, have openly asserted title to the property, at least from the year 1801 down to the present time;
and while the bill herein contains no averments respecting.
possession, it may be assumed that, for a long time at
least, possession has followed the title. Assuming Blodget
and those inheriting from him, and under whom appellant
claims, were equitably entitled to the reversion, subject
only to the ninety-nine year terms, any possession of the
lessees has been,, as against the outside world, the possession of the appellant and his predecessors in title. Therefore it is more than probable that any legal title remaining
in the Commissioners has become barred by long possession. Besides, it might perhaps, after 120 years, be presumed at law, as well as in equity, that the Commissioners
had made a deed or deeds to Blodget that had since been
lost. And, since both parties to the present controversy
claim under Blodget, and would probably in an action of
ejectment be required to trace title no further back than
the common source, it is better, we think, to lay aside for

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

present purposes the theory that the equitable jurisdiction
in this action can be supported upon the ground that
Blodget derived only an equitable title from the Commissioners.
This brings us to the real controversy, which is the effect
of the proceedings and decree in the Bickley suit, and the
deeds made thereunder by Brent, Trustee, to the purchasers of the "ground-rents."
For present purposes, we may accede to the contention
of appellant that the bill of complaint herein shows, with
respect to the parcel that was covered by the Fennell
lease, the title to which passed under the supplemental
bill and decree in the Bickley suit, that the effect of the
proceedings, and the language of the decree, and of the
deed made by Davidson, Trustee, thereunder, was such
as to pass to the purchaser a legal title to the reversion.
Assuming this, however, it does not follow that the
appellees, if they have the equitable as well as the legal title
to the Fennell parcel, and if at the same time they have
the equitable but not the legal title to the Daugherty and
Frethy parcels, may not properly invoke the aid of equity
against the ejectment suit. If the appellant had limited
his action at law to the Fennell parcel, his contention that
if the Willard title to that parcel is good at all, it is as good
at law as in equity, and therefore available as a defense
in the ejectment suit, would demand consideration.
But appellant brought the action of ejectment for an
entire lot made up of three parcels, of which the Fennell
plot lies between the other two. The appellees, if driven
to invoke the aid of equity against that action because
they had an equitable and not a legal title to the Daugherty and Frethy parcels, were fairly entitled to bring the
entire controversy into the court of equity, so that it
might be adjudicated in a single suit.
A court of equity ought to do justice completely, and
not by halves. Decker v. Caskey, 1 N. J. Eq. 427, 433;

One of the duties of such a court is to prevent a multiplicity of suits, and to this end a court of equity, if obliged
to take cognizance of a cause for any purpose, will ordinarily retain it for all purposes, even though this requires it
to determine purely legal rights that otherwise would not
be within the range of its authority. Oelrichs v. Spain, 15
Wall. 211, 228; Holland v. Challen, 110 U. S. 15; Reynes

U. S. 505, 514; Gormley v. Clark, 134 U. S. 338, 349. And
since there is no question that the equitable title of appellees to the Fennell lot is good, if their equitable title to
the Daugherty and Frethy lots is good, we may proceed
at once to the question of the effect of the proceedings and
decree in the Bickley suit, and the deeds made thereunder,
as bearing upon these two lots.
In strictness of law, the deeds made by Brent, Trustee,
purporting to convey the "ground rents" on the Daugherty and Frethy leases cannot be deemed to have included
the reversion. The rule at law is, that by a grant of the
reversion the rent reserved will pass; but that by a grant
of the rent the reversion will not pass. "The incident,
accessary, appendant, and regardant, shall in most cases
pass by the grant of the principal, without the words cum
pertinentiis, but not 6 converso; for the principal doth not
pass by the grant of the incident, &c. Accessorium non
ducit, sed sequitur, suum principale." Shepp. Touch. 89.
And see Co. Litt. 152a; Broom. Leg. Max. (7th ed.),
491, 493.
The contention of appellant is that the term "ground
rents," as employed in the decree of the court in the case
of Bickley v. Blodget, has a plain and clear meaning, ascertainable without recourse to outside evidence; and it is
insisted that the rents referred to were limited to the

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

terms of ninety-nine years, because the only rents mentioned in the leases are the annual rents reserved by
Blodget in each demise, to be paid during the respective
terms of ninety-nine years, and which therefore would
cease with the expiration of the term.
The argument elaborates the legal status of the lessor
and lessee under the leases. It is said that the import of
the contract is plain; that a lease for a specific and definite
term of ninety-nine years, and no longer, was created; and
that an option was given in connection therewith to the
respective lessees and their successors in interest for other
and further terms of similar duration, and also an option
for the purchase of the demised premises during the terms
created or any future term. And it is insisted that the
leases extended only until the expiration of their respective terms, and did not, proprio vigore, extend or
continue such terms for a definite or indefinite period; that
the options made the existence of new leases in the future
possible, but not certain; that the creation of future
leases depended wholly on the exercise of the privilege
of a renewal by each lessee or his successor in interest;
and that the privilege not having been exercised in either
instance, all rights of the lessees expired at the end of
ninety-nine years.
All this may be assumed, as matter of law, without
advancing u§ far towards the solution of the real question
presented. If the appellant is entitled to the reversion,
the question whether the appellees or their predecessors
in title have lost the right of renewal or purchase by failure
to exercise the option, and whether equity will relieve
them by decreeing a renewal on proper terms, may require
consideration.
But the question must first be answered whether, in
the, sight of equity, the appellant is entitled to the reversion. The appellees, besides showing a title to the leasehold interests of Daugherty and Frethy, respectively claim

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

to have acquired also the reversion in fee that remained in
Blodget; and this they claim under the decree in the
Bickley suit, and the deeds made thereunder, in which
the interest was denominated "ground rents." Now,
while we cannot say that this term is the recognized
equivalent of any legal estate in lands, it is clear that as a
descriptive term it has, and had at the time of the proceedings under consideration, some recognized meaning
that may be resorted to as evidence of the intent of the
parties, and from which may be determined what effect
ought in equity to be given to the proceedings and decree
in the Bickley suit.
In Bosley v. Bosley's Exrs. (1852), 14 How. 390, 396,
this court (by Mr. Chief Justice Taney) said, with respect to a somewhat similar lease made by a resident of
the City of Paltimore for lands in Baltimore County:
"In the case before us, the interest which the testator
had in this land at the time of making his will, was converted into money by his contract with Armstrong. It
was a sale and an agreement to convey his whole interest
in the land. It is, therefore, unlike the case of a lease
for years, or of ninety-nine years, renewable forever, in
which the lessor retains the reversion, and does not bind
himself to convey it on any terms to the lessee. The
form of the contract adopted in this instance, between
the testator and Armstrong, is in familiar use in the sale
of lots in the city of Baltimore and the adjacent country.
It has nearly, if not altogether superseded the old forms
of contract, where the vendor conveyed the lands, and
took a mortgage to secure the payment of the purchase
money-or gave his bond for the conveyance, and retained
the legal title in himself until the purchase money was
paid. And it has taken the place of these forms of contract, because it is far more convenient, both to the seller
and the purchaser. For it enables the vendee to postpone
the payment of a large portion of the purchase money

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

until he finds it entirely convenient to pay it; and, at
the same time, it ismore advantageous to the vendor, as
it gives him a better security for the punctual payment
of the interest; and while an extended credit is given to
the vendee, it is to the vendor a sale for cash. For if
his gTound rent is well secured, he can, at any time, sell it
in the market for the balance of the purchase money left
in the hands of the vendee. It will be observed that the
rent reserved is precisely the interest on the amount of the
purchase money remaining unpaid."
That leases for ninety-nine years, renewable forever,
were common in Maryland, and therefore presumably
well understood in Washington at the time of the Bickley
foreclosure, appears from Banks v. Haskie (1876), 45 Maryland, 207, 213, 217; Myers v. Silijacks (1882), 58 Ma: yland,
319, 330; Ogle v. Reynolds (1891), 75 Maryland, 145, 150;
Jones v. Rose, 96 Maryland, 483, 484. It is contended that,
these cases, and especially Banks v. Haskie, show a departure from the principles that anciently obtained in that
State, and that the- contracts between Blodget and his
lessees were made 'in view of the law as understood in the
year 1801. We need not stop to discuss this, because we
are dealing with the term "ground rents," not as a term
of law, but as a term of description, and we cite the Maryland cases as historical authorities, irrespective of their authority as law.
The contention of the appellant that the term ground
rents as used in the proceedings and, deeds in question,
imported, only the rents that were to accrue during the
residue of the 99-year terms of the.Daugherty and Frethy
leases, respectively, will not bear analysis.
In the first place, it was of the essence of both leases,
that the terms were "ninety-nine years, renewable forever." The rent was to be the same for the extended
terms as for the initial term of ninety-nine years. It
certainly cannot have been within the contemplation of

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion cf thc Court.

229 U. S.

the parties that the lessee or his assigns would not find
it advantageous to renew at the end of ninety-nine years.
The lessees were required tc put substantial buildings
upon the lots. And all the circumstances show that the
parties contemplated that,long before the expiration of the
lease, the lands demised would be in the midst of a real,
and not a "paper" city.
Moreover, the theory that it was intended to separate
the right to the rentals until the year 1900 from the right
to those that would accrue under renewals of the term,
presupposes that the parties intended to separate the
ground rents from the reversion. But such a separation
is hardly conceivable. The only real security that the
lessor had for the payment of the rents was the right
reserved to him to enter and repossess the land until the
arrearages were paid, or to terminate the lease should
they not be paid. It is obvious that if the owner of the
ground rents had no right to the estate upon the termination of the lease, his action in terminating it would benefit
not himself, but the owner of the reversion. In short,
this view would leave the payments to accrue during

the residue of the ninety-nine years, no longer entitled
to be designated as" ground rents." They would in effect
stand as ordinary choses-in-action, resting for security
upon the personal responsibility of the lessees, or their
assignees in possession; subject to be rendered valueless
by the insolvency of the lessee, or perhaps defeated, so
far as the assignee's liability was cqncerned, by an assignment to a pauper. Valliant v. Dodemede, 2 Atk. 546;
26 Eng. Reprint, 728; Lekeux v. Nash, 2 Stra. 1221.
Nor is it reasonable to suppose that the parties intended
to reserve in Blodget any estate in the lands, present or
future. We say the parties, because in equity the decree,
and the deed made thereunder, must, we think, be deemed
to be the act of Blodget as well as of Bickley and the other
parties to the cause.

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The action was not, as it has been termed by counsel,
a "creditor's suit." It was a foreclosure suit, brought
to enforce the mortgage that Blodget had given for the
purpose of* securing to the fortunate holders of winning
tickets in his much advertised lottery the prizes ne had
promised them. That all of Blodget's interest in the
lands was pledged under the mortgage has already been
stated; that he recognized his equitable obligation is evident from the record. In the common law action brought
by Bickley against him in Philadelphia, he agreed that
the jury might act as arbitrators not only with respect
to the amount of money due from him to Bickley, but
with respect to enforcing the award upon his land in
the District of Columbia. When the foreclosure suit was
commenced, he aided it by admissions, consents, and
stipulations, showing himself in every way willing to
forward the object aimed at by Bickley, namely, to subject the mortgaged property to the performance of his
obligations arising out of the lottery scheme.
It was clearly the purpose to sell all the beneficial interest that Blodget had in the several plots in question,
subject to the leases. This reserved interest was denominated "ground rents," (using a phrase evidently in
popular use), without distinction as to their duration,
and therefore presumably meaning that they should be
perpetual, as well as the leases 'under which they were
derived; but subject, of course, to commutation by the
exercise of the lessee's option of purchase at an amount
of which the annual rental was the equivalent of eight
per centum.
The proceedings in the Bickley-Blodget suit show beyond cavil or question that it was the purpose not only of
the parties to the action, but of the court, that all of Elodget's right, title and interest in Lot 20 should be sold towards paying the debt he owed to the complainant. The
reservation of any interest in Blodget was inconsistent with

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

the very object of the suit. The reversion would be practically valueless for approximately ninety years; its then
present purchase-value would be altogether insignificant.
A purpose to reserve it in I3lodget is not suppbsable. If
it had been thought of as a substantial interest, separate
from that described as "ground rents," it would have been
mentioned, as it was mentioned, and in terms included,
in the decree made on the supplemental bill. In no event
would Blodget have been permitted to retain it.
Nor is there any room to doubt that bidders at the sale,
including the successful bidders who became the purchasers, supposed that in buying the "ground rents" they
were buying an investment security representing the substantial fruits, and the entire fruits, of ownership reserved
by Blodget on the leases;-and not for mere terms of ninety
nine years, but for such terms "renewable foreer." That
the interest of Blodget sold for its fair market value is
beyond question, for otherwise the court would not have
confirmed the sales.
After the sales were confirmed, only two things remained to be done in order to carry the decree of the
court into effect so far as concerned the passing of title.
One was-"The payment of the whole purchase money
for the respective parts of the said property so sold;"
the other was that "the said trustee by a deed or deeds
good and operative in law, to be acknowledged, etc.,
shall give, grant, bargain and sell, release and confirm to
the respective purchasers and their heirs respectively"
the property sold; with Peter and Munroe joining, in
order to make sure that no legal title should remain outstanding.
There is no doubt that the purchase price was paid;
indeed, one of the purchasers in question was Bickley,
the complainant, for whose benefit the sale was made.
Such payment being made, the purchasers at once became
the owners, in equity, of the reversionary interest of

CAMP v. BOYD.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Blodget. But the decree entitled them to the legal
title.
And deeds of conveyance were made in order to carry
out the decree. But one thing was lacking; the deeds
were not "good and operative in law," because, although
they described well enough according to the common
intent what was intended to be conveyed, they did not
define it according to the legal formula. And so the
form of the deeds was undoubtedly defective. This,
upon all the evidence, was a mistake, pure and simple.
And it was the mistake of a public officer. To say that
when such a mistake occurs in carrying out the decree of a
court of equity,-a court possessed of full jurisdiction
over the subject-matter and all the parties-harmful consequences shall be permitted to fall upon the purchasers
who, in reliance upon the apparent regularity of the procetdings, have paid the purchase-money to the officer of
the court in the belief that they would get as good a title
as the court could give them, and as good as the court
.could require any of the parties before it to give them,would be nothing less than a reproach upon the administration of justice.
The equitable principles upon which our decision must
turn, are simple and fundamental. Equity regards that
a done which ought to be done. It looks to the true
intent and meaning, rather than to the form. It relieves
against the consequences of accident and mistake, as well
as of fraud.
In Lytle v. State of Arkansas, 9 How. 314, 333, this
court (by Mr. Justice McLean) said: "It is a well established principle, that where an individual in the prosecution of a right does everything which the law requires him
to do, and he fails to attain his right by the misconduct
or neglect of a public officer, the law will protet him."
In Williams v. United States, 138 U. S. 514, 517, the court
(by Mr. Justice Brewer), said: "It cannot be doubted

that inadvertence and mistake are, equally with fraud
and wrong, grounds for judicial interference to divest a
title acquired thereby. This is equally true, in transactions between individuals, and in those between the
government and its patentee. If, through inadvertence
and mistake, a wrong description is placed in a deed by
an individual, and property not intended to be conveyed
is conveyed, can there be any doubt of the jurisdiction
of a court of equity to interfere and restore to the party
the title which he never intended to convey? So of any
other inadvertence and mistake, vital in its nature, by
which a title is conveyed when it ought not to have been
conveyed." See, also, Morrison v. Stalnaker, 104 U. S.
213; Ard v. Brandon, 156 U. S.537, 541; Duluth & Iron
Range R.. Co. v. Roy, 173 U. S.587, 590.
In our opinion the averments of the bill herein, admitted
by the demurrer, show that, with respect to the Daugherty
and Frethy lots, the appellees have a good title in equity,
but not at law, as against the appellant, and therefore
are entitled to restrain him, and those claiming under
him, from prosecuting an action of ejectment, or otherwise
asserting title to those plots. And, with respect to the
Fennell plot, the same result follows, for reasons above
given, although appellees' title, besides being good in
equity as against that of the appellant, is also good at
law, and therefore might have been availed of as a legal
defense.
Decree affirmed.
