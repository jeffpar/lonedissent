that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the
case proved. We think the objection was interposed in
due time and that the state courts erred in overruling it.
Two of the plaintiffs, the father and mother, in whose
favor there was a separate recovery, are not even beneficiaries under the Federal statute, there being a surviving
widow; and she was not entitled to recover in her own
name, but only through the deceased's personal representative, as is shown by the terms of the statute and the decisions before cited. See also Tiffany on Death by Wrongful Act, 2d ed., §§ 80, 109, 116.
The judgment is accordingly reversed and the case
is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion, but without prejudice to such rights as
a personal representative of the deceased may have.

-DEGGE v. HITCHCOCK, POSTMASTER GENERAL.
MAURY v. SAME.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

Nos. 157, 158.

Argued January 31, 1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

This is apparently the first case in which a Federal court has been
asked to issue a writ of certiorari to review a ruling by an executive
officer of the United States Government.
Constant failure to apply for a particular remedy suggests that it is
due to 'conceded want of power in the courts to grant it.
Tlhe scope of the writ of certiorari as it exists at common law has not
been enlarged by any statute in the Federal jurisdiction, and cases

Statement of the Case.

in which it has issued under statute from state courts to state officers
are not controlling in the Federal courts.
While the original scope of the writ of certiorari has been enlarged so
as to serve the office of a writ of error, it has always run from court
to court or to such boards, tribunals and inferior jurisdictions whose
findings and decisions had the quality of a final decision and from
which there was no appeal or other method of review.
The decision of the Postmaster General that a fraud order shallissue is
not the exercise of a judicial function, and if the decision is beyond
his jurisdiction the party injured may obtain relief in equity; the
order cannot be reviewed by certiorari.
So long as proceedings before an executive officer are in fieri the courts
will not interfere with them. Plested v. Abbey, 228 U. S. 42.
The writ of certiorari is an extraordinary remedy, and in deciding that
it will not issue in a particular case this court does not anticipate
in what cases exceptional facts may call for its use.
35 App. D. C. 218, 228, affirmed.
IN 1909 complaint was made to the postal authorities
that W. W. Degge and the Wellington corporations, of
which he was president, were using the mails in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. Notice was given to Degge
and the corporations and a hearing was had before the
officer to whom, under the Postal Regulations, the disposition of this class of cases was committed. He found
that the charges were true and to his finding he attached
a copy of all the evidence which had been taken. The
report was confirmed by the Postmaster General, who
issued an order directing the postmaster at Boulder,
Colorado, not to deliver mail addressed to Degge or to
these corporations, but to return all such letters to the
sender with the word "Fraudulent" plainly stamped on
the envelope. Rev. Stat, § 3929, 4041.
Degge, the corporations, and some of the stockholders,
thereafter filed petitions in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia alleging that the officer before whom
the hearing had been had was without power to make the
report on'which the Postmaster General had acted; that
there was no testimony to show the existence of a fraud-

ulent scheme, and no evidence whatever to support the
finding. It was alleged that the order was arbitrary, in
excess of the power of the Postmaster General, and void.
The petitioners prayed that the court would issue writs
of certiorari directing the Postmaster General to certify
the record to the court and that upon hearing and review
thereof the court would set aside the order. A rule to
show cause was granted. The Postmaster General demurred on'the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to issue the writ, and subject thereto answered,
attaching the record and the evidence on th hearing before the officer of the Post-Office Department having
charge of the Fraud Orders investigations.
The case. was heard by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on petition, demurrer and answer. After
a hearing the court dismissed the case. The Court of
'Appeals of the District, without passing on the right to
issue the writ, affirmed the judgment upon the ground.
that the evidence supported the order. The petitioners
appealed and on the argument in-this court, the Government renews the contention that the District Court was
without jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari to the
Postmaster General.
Mr. 0. A. Erdman, with whom Mr. Walter B. Guy was
onThe
the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
rights of petitioner Degge and the corporations
are
based upon the common right of citizens to receive mail
unless that right has been forfeited by a use of the mails
for purposes which are condemned by the acts of Congress
as criminal, such as lotteries and similar schemes for
perpetrating fraud. Petitioners' business consists in making investments in lands, irrigation ditches, reservoirs,
mining property, stocks and securities, and they are not
engaged in any business or practice prohibited by any law
of the United States. The facts shown by the evidence

and reported to the Postmaster General are not only insufficient in law to sustain the supposed "findings," but
do not constitute any scheme or device condemned by
§§ 3929, 4041, Rev. Stat., or any other law authorizing
the Postmaster General to issue a fraud order.
The petitioning stockholders based their case on the
common right of citizens to have their mail forwarded
and delivered, unless such mail contained matter vicious,
corrupting, immoral or dangerous in violation of the laws
of Congress.
Inasmuch as the Postmaster General has rested his. defense in this proceeding entirely upon the findings and
conclusions of his subordinate, and has relied upon such
findings and conclusions as being conclusive and not subject to review by the courts, suppressing and omitting
from this record the papers on which such findings and
conclusions are based, it becomes necessary to bring up the
omitted papers by means of the writ of certiorari, and
this will show how many more "false and misleading"
statements there are and who made them.
The answer of the Postmaster General declaring that
whether he is right or wrong, or whether he has misconstrued the law or not, is not for the courts to say, and that
the courts have no business to interfere, is in the face of
the fact that the findings do not support any fraud order
against any of the corporations, according to which
Degge is the only offender.
Decisions of the Postmaster General in fraud order
cases are by no means final and conclusive. Bank v.
Gilson, 161 Fed. Rep. 290; American School v. McAnulty,
187 U. S. 94, 108-110; Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137,
171.
The writ of certiorari at common law is considered as
an extraordinary remedy resorted to for the purpose of
supplying a defect of justice in cases obviously entitled
to redress, and yet unprovided for by the ordinary forms

of proceedings. Harris on Cert., §§ 17-21; 4 Enc. P. &
P. 9, and see Duggan v. McGruder, 12 Am. Dec. 536.
In the Federal courts it is in the nature of a writ of
error to bring up after judgment the proceedings of an
inferior court or tribunal whose procedure is not according
to the course of the common law. Harris v. Barber, 129
U. S. 366-369; Dist. of Col. v. Brooke, 29 App. D. C. 563;
Dist. of Col. v. Burgdorf, 6,App. D. C. 465.
The test of the question whether a proceeding is reviewable upon certiorari is not what are the usual functions
exercised by the tribunal, but what is the character of the
proceedings sought to be reviewed. Where an executive
officer is charged with duties of a judicial nature the action
can be so reviewed. Duggan v. McGruder, 12 Am. Dec.
527; 536; Cunningham v. Squires, 2 W. Va. 422, 424; State
v. Ansel, 76 So. Car. 395, 412-414.
The proceeding before the Postmaster General in this
case was quasi-judicial in character. It involved a hearing and the ascertainment of facts upon evidence. It resulted in a decision based upon alleged satisfactory evidence. United States v. Burton, 131 Fed. Rep. 552, 556.
Public officers whom the court has power by injunction
to restrain are ministerial and not judicial; certiorari is
an appropriate legal remedy and there is no necessity for
resort to equity. Western R. R. Co., v. Nolan, 48 N. Y.
513, 518.
Where there is technically no record, the proceedings
ano orders in, the nature of a record can, as a rule, alone
b6 regarded. But the evidence upon a disputed jurisdictional fact is reviewable, as well as every issue of law
upon the question of jurisdiction. Not only the record,
but the evidence to support jurisdiction must, when
necessary, be returned. Whitney v. Board, 14 California,
479, 500; People v. Goodwin, 1 Selden (N. Y.), 568, 572;
Stone v. Mayor, 25 Wend. (N. Y.) 157, 170; see also

People v. Board of Police, 39 N. Y. 506, 518; People v.
Brooklyn, 103 N. Y. 370.
All parties interested and aggrieved are entitled to the
writ. It is not necessary that a petitioner for a certiorari
should be a party of record, but only that he should be
interested in the subject-matter upon which the record
rests. Dyer v. Lowell, 30 Maine, 217, 220; Hemmer v.
Bonson (Ia.), 117 N. W. Rep. 257, 259.
If the exercise of a sound judicial discretion requires
that one thus injured ought to have the writ it is an abuse
of authority to refuse it. State v. Chittenden, 127 Wisconsin, 468,470, Syl. 4.
Where individual rights are affected in a case in which
there are no formal parties and no appeal or other remedy
for an excess of jurisdiction exists, a review by certiorari
is allowed to those who are bound by the proceedings.
Elliott v. Superior Court, 144 California, 501, 508; Campau

It is practically universally agreed that the case is not reviewable on the merits, and that a writ of error is inappropriate to settle disputed questions of fact. Water Co. v.

The fraud order issued by Postmaster General was
correct in law, and his findings of fact were supported by
ample evidence. Harris v. Rosenberger, 145 Fed. Rep.
449; Public Clearing House v. Coyne, 194 U. S. supra.
The evil sought to be remedied is the same in this case

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is the first instance, so far as we can find, in
which a Federal court has been asked to issue a writ of
certiorari to review a ruling by an executive officer of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

United States Government. That at once suggests that
the failure to make such application has been due to the
conceded want of power to issue the writ to such officers.
For, since the adoption of the Constitution, there have
been countless rulings by heads of departments that directly affected personal and property rights and where
the writ of certiorari, if available, would have furnished
an effective method by which to test the validity of quasijudicial orders under attack. The modern decisions cited
to sustain the power of the court to act in the present
case are based on state procedure and statutes that authorize the 'writ to issue not only to inferior tribunals,
boards, assessors and administrative officers, but even to
the Chief Executive of a State in proceedings where a
quasi-judicial order has been made. But none of these
decisions are in point in a Federal jurisdiction where no
statute has been passed to enlarge the scope of the writ
at common law.
In ancient times it was used to compel the production
of a record for use as evidence; more often to supplement
a defective record in an appellate court, and later, to remove, before judgment-Harris v. Barber, 129 U. S. 366,
369-a record from a court without jurisdiction and with
a view of preventing error rather than of correcting it.
When later still its scope was enlarged so as to make it
serve the office of a writ of error, certiorari was granted
only in those instances in which the inferior tribunal had
acted without jurisdiction, or in disregard of statutory
provisions. But in those cases the writ ran to boards
(Reaves v. Ainsworth, 219 U. S. 296), officers, tribunals and
inferior judicatures, whose findings and decisions, even
though erroneous, had the quality of a final judgment, and
there being no right of appeal or other method of review,
the extraordinary writ of certiorari was resorted to from
necessity to afford a remedy where there would otherwise
have been a denial of justice. But in all those cases it ran

DEGGE v. HITCHCOCK.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

from court to court,-including boards, officers or tribunals
having a limited statutory jurisdiction, but whose judgments would be conclusive unless set aside.
The appellant insists that under these common law
principles the writ should issue here because, having to act
"upon evidence satisfactory to him" (Rev. Stat., § 3929),
and notice and a hearing having been given, the Postmaster General acted in a judicial capacity in making
the order, which was therefore subject to review on certiorari because he exceeded his jurisdiction and, without
any proof of fraud in the use of the mails, deprived appellants of the valuable right to receive letters and money
through the post-office.
It is true that the Postmaster General gave notice and
a hearing to the persons specially to be affected by the
order and that in making his ruling he may be said to
have acted in a quasi-judicial capacity. But the statute
was passed primarily for the benefit of the public at large
and the order was for them and their protection. That
fact gave an administrative quality to the hearing and to
the order and was sufficient to prevent it from being
subject to review by writ of certiorari. The Postmaster
General could not exercise judicial functions, and in making the decision he was not an officer presiding over a
tribunal where his ruling was final unless reversed. Not
being a judgment, it was not subject to appeal, writ of
error, or certiorari. Not being a judgment, in the sense
of a final adjudication, the appellants were not concluded
by his decision, for had there been an arbitrary exercise
of statutory power or a ruling in excess of the jurisdiction
conferred, they had the right to apply for and obtain appropriate relief in a court of equity. School of Magnetic
Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94. Philadelphia Co. v.
Stimson, 223 U. S.605, 620.
The fact that there was this remedy is itself sufficient
to take the case out of the principle on which, at common

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

law, right to the writ was founded. For there it issued to
officers and tribunals only because there was no other
method of preventing injustice. Besides, if the common
law writ, with all of its incidents, could be construed to
apply to administrative and quasi-judicialrulings it could,
with a greater show of authority, issue to remove a record
before decision and so prevent a ruling in any case where
it was claimed there was no jurisdiction to act. This
would overturn the principle that, as long as the proceedings are in fieri the courts will not interfere with the
hearing and disposition of matters before the Departments.
Plested v. Abbey, 228 U. S. 42, 51. To hold that the writ
could issue either before or after an administrative ruling
would make the dispatch of business in the Departments
wait on the decisions of the courts and not only lead to
consequences of the most manifest inconvenience, but
would be an invasion of the Executive by the Judicial
branch of the Government.
The writ of certiorari is one of the extraordinary remedies and being such it is impossible to anticipate what
exceptional facts may arise to call for its use, but the present case is not of that character, but rather an instance
of an attempt to use the writ for the purpose of reviewing
an administrative order. Public Clearing House v. Coyne,
194 U. S. 497. This cannot be done.
Affirmed.
