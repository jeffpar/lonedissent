UNITED STATES v. ADAMS EXPRESS COMPANY.
ERROR TO

THE DISTRICT

COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.

No. 652.

Argued April 7, 1913.-Decided June 9, 1913.

The decision of the court below, granting a motion to quash the service
on the ground that the statute on which the indictment is based does
not include the defendant, is equivalent to a decision sustaining a
demurrer to the indictment and is based upon the construction of
the statute, and this court has jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907.
Under § 10 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by the act
of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, express companies are ineluded in the term common carrier and made amenable to the act.
Congress at that time had knowledge of the fact that some of the
great express companies were organized as joint stock associations
and the amendment was intended to bring such associations under
the act.
A joint stock association is amenable to the provisions of the Act to
Regulate Commerce and is subject to indictment for violations
thereof.
Congress has power to charge the assets of joint stock associations with
liability and to personify them so far as to collect fines by proceeding
against them in the respective names of the associations.
THE facts,

which involve the question of whether a joint

stock association is amenable to the anti-discrimination
t) Regulate Commerce, are stated
provisions of the A
in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison, with whom
Mr. Loring C. Christie was on the brief, for the United
States.:
The words of the Interstate Commerce Act explicitly
make e' express companies" guilty of misdemeanor if they
violate its provisions, and these words were intended to
mean what they say and to cover all express companies.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Argument for the United States.

229 U. S.

There is no reason for limiting their scope to corporate,
as distinguished from joint stock, "companies."
The duties imposed by the statute are imposed upon
the express companies as companies and not on their
members as individuals. American Express Co. v. United
States, 212 _U. S. 522; Queen v. Commercial Co. (1891), 2
Q. B. 588, 592 et seq.
All the real reasons which could have influenced Congress to apply the penal provisions of the act to corporate
companies as entities equally exist in reference to joint
stock companies as entities.
Prior to the passage of the Hepburn Act of June 29,
1906, which made the Interstate Commerce Act applicable to "express companies" the Elkins Law had provided that corporations'should be subject to indictment as
entities and the Hepburn Act, by using the words "express
companies" rather than "express corporations" clearly
indicated the intention of Congress to extend that principle to joint stock corporations engaged in the express
business.
In §§ 3, 6, 9 and 10 of the Act to Regulate Commerce,
the distinction is drawn between "corporations" and
"companies" and it is therefore apparent that Congress
was aware of the difference and did not intend by the
words "express companies" to mean. merely "express
corporations.'!
The joint stock association express companies including the defendant have been repeatedly before this court
even under indictment and the point has never heretofore
been rnade that they were not subject to indictment.

Express Co. v. United States, 212 U. S. 522; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, 165 U. S. 194, 166 U. S. 185.
In general, joint stock associations have liabilities
which partnerships have not, as, for instance, the liability
for contempt of court (J. & P. Coats, Ltd., v. Chadwick
(1894), 1 Chancery, 347); and for torts, including fraud
and libel, 1 Lindley on the Law of Companies, 6th ed.,
pp. 267-268; Van Aerman v. Bleistein, 152 N. Y. 355;
Whitney v. Backus, 149 Pa. St. 29. As to penal actions,

Association, Ltd., 5 Appeal Cases, 857; Queen v. Tyler &

Pearks &c. v. Ward (1902), 2 K. B. 1; Lawler v. Egan,
Ltd. (1901), 2 Ir. 589.
It is not material whether the New York law distinctly
treats joint stock companies as entities, for the Interstate Commerce Act does so and that is sufficient. Liverpool Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566, 574.
But even in New York these companies are entities.

The Federal cases which held that they are not "citizens," as entities, under the diversity clause are distinguishable because they rest upon the individual liability
of the members and not upon any lack of the quality of
entities. Chapman v. Barney, 129 U. S. 677; Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 449; Thomnas

H. R. R. Co. v. United States, 212 U. S.481.
Mr. Joseph S. Graydon, with whom Mr. Lawrcnce
Maxwell was on the brief, for defendant in error:
The court has no jurisdiction to review the decision

and judgment of the court below.
The act of M\arch 2, 1907, confers no jurisdiction on
this court to review a criminal case generally on writ of
error by the Government, but only in so far as itinvolves
the invalidity or constructioin of the statute upon which
the indictment is based. United States v. Patten, 226
U. S. 525; United States v. Stevenson, 215 U. S. 190,
195.
Statutes of the several States allowing appeals by thd
State in criminal cases are construed strictly so as to confine such appeals to the precise matters covered by the
statute. State v. Adams, 193 Missouri, 196; People v.
Higgiits, 114 California, 63; People v. Richter, 113 California, 473; ,tate v. Evansville Ry. Co., 107 Indiana, 581;

The present case does not fall within the statute. The
defendant entered no appearance and filed no pleading
in the court below. The cause was dismissed, but the

decision or judgment dismissing it was not a decision or
judgment quashing, setting aside or sustaining a demurrer to the indictment. The court treated the motion
to set aside and quash the return of the summons as a
demurrer to" the indictment, but this was not at the request or with the consent of defendant. The court had,
no authority to treat the motion of Barrett to set aside
service as a demurrer of the Adams Express Company,
and by so doing confer jurisdiction on this court not
provided for in the Criminal Appeals Act.
The Adams Express Comlany is not a corporation but
a joint stock association or co-partnership. Chapman v.

ed. (1891).
Members of a joint stock association may be sued or
indicted, but not in the company name, unless a statute
so provides. Taylor v. Weir, 171 Fed. Rep. 636; 23 Cyc.

In the absence of an enabling statutory provision,.a
joint stock association cannot sue or be sued or prosecuted
by indictment or otherwise in its associate name.
There is no statute of the United States which authorizes the institution of an action by or against a joint stock

name.

the laws of the United States cannot be prescribed and
governed by state law, common or statutory, and vary
with the laws of the several States. Logan v. United
States, 144 U. S.263, 283.
The Government cites civil and criminal cases in this
and other courts to which such companies have been parties in their associate name, but in. no case was the Federal
question of proper indictment raised. Adams Exp. Co. v.

Opinion of the Court.

271, 275; N. Y. Cent. R. R. v. United States, 212 U. S.
481, 495.
Section 1 of the Elkins Law has no application to a
common carrier that is not a corporation.
The several amendments extended the application of
the act to various kinds of common carriage other than
those originally included, but did not extend or change
the application of the act as affected by the personnel ,or
particular form of organization adopted by the persons
engaged in the several kinds of common carriage covered
by the act from time to time.
If there be any fair doubt of the application of a criminal statute it must be resolved in favor of the accused;

Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95; Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S.

States v. Biggs, 157 Fed. Rep. 264; Commonwealth v.
Adams Express Co., 123 ,Kentucky, 720.
It is not denied that interstate express carriers, whether
corporations, individuals or co-partnerships, are subject
to the regulations imposed by the Interstate Commerce
Act and to the jurisdiction of the Commission, but when
they are charged in the courts with criminal offenses, the
proceedings must be in accordance with fundamental
principles of criminal law and procedure.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an indictment, under the Act to Regulate
Commerce, of the Adams Express Company, by that
name, alleging it to be 'a joint stock association,.organized
and existing under and by virtue of the common law of
the State of New York.' A summons to the Adams
Express Company was issued and returned served on
Charles F. Barrett, general agent for said company.
Thereupon Barrett moved to quash the service and return

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

'on the ground that the same are not authorized by law.'
The entry with regard to the action upon this motion is
that the court, "treating said motion as a demurrer to
the indictment, finds that the indictment cannot be
maintained against the Adams Express Company for
the reason that it appears on the face of said indictment
that the said Adams Express Company is not a corporation, but is a joint stock association
.
and for
this reason the motion to quash service, treated as a demurrer to the indictment, is sustained and the defendant
discharged, and the cause dismissed; to all of Which the
United States of America, by its counsel, excepts."
It is objected that this court has no jurisdiction of
the present writ of error under the act of March 2, 1907,
c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, and that the court below had no
authority to treat the motion of Barrett as equivalent to a
demurrer. Without following the defendant into the
niceties by 'which it seeks to escape the jurisdiction
of
this court after having eluded that of the court below, it
is enough to say that in our opinion, if we are to go behind
the entry, the decision entered was one setting aside the
indictment and was based upon the construction of the
statute upon which the indictment is founded, within
the meaning of the act of March 2, 1907.
We turn to the merits. The indictment alleges that the
Adams Express Company had filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission its schedules of rates and charges,
specifies what those charges were in certain cases, and
sets forth in different counts instances in which the company demanded and received sums in excess of its schedule
rates for the parcels carried-in short, disobeyed the act
of February 4, 1887, c. 104, § 6, 24 Stat. 379, 380. By
§ 10 (amended by act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 10, 36
Stat. 539, 549), any common carrier subject to the provisions of the act, wilfully doing this is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine.
.

UNITED STATES v. ADAMS EXPRESS CO.
229 U. S,

389

Opinion of the Court.

The objection to applying § 10 to the defendant has
been indicated. It is confirmed in argument by the citation of many cases in which such companies are treated
as simple partnerships, including those in which this
court has declined to extend the legal fiction applied in
determining jurisdiction over corporations so as to cover
themn. Chapman v. Barney, 129 U. S. 677. Great Southern
Fbreproof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 449, 454, 456.
Thomas v. Board of Trustees, 195 U. S. 207. But the
argument is met by the plain words of the statute as it
now stands. For by § 1 of the original act of 1887, as
amended by the act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584,
"The term 'common carrier' as used in this act shall
include express companies and sleeping car companies."
And thus the liability of common carriers created by § 10
stands as if it read that express companies violating § 6
shoUld be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to fine.
It has been notorious for many years that some of the
great express companies are organized as joint stock
- ;ociations, and the reason for the amendment hardly
could be seen unless it was intended to bring those associations under the act. As suggested in the argument for
the Government, no one, certainly not the defendant,
,-eems to have doubted that the statute now imposes upon
them the duty to file schedules of rates. American Express Co. v. United States, 212 U. S; 522, 531. (The
American Express Company is a joint stock association.)
But if it imposes upon them the duties under the words
common carrier as interpreted, it is reasonable to suppose
that the same words are intended to impose upon them
the penalty inflicted on common carriers in case those
duties are not performed. It is true that a doubt was
raised by the wording of § 10 in the original act, whether
corporations were indictable under it. This doubt was
met by the act of February 19, 1903, c. 708, § 1, 32 Stat.
847. We do not preceive that any inference can be drawn

OCTOBER TERM, 1912,
Opinion of; the Court.

229 U. S.

from this source in favor of a construction of the later
amendment other than that we deem the natural one.
The power of Congress hardly is denied. The constitutionality of the statute as against corporations is
established, New York Central & Hudson River R. R. Co.
v. United States, 212 U. S. 481, 492, and no reason is
suggested why Congress has not equal power to charge
the partnership assets with a liability and to personify
the company so far as to collect a fine by a proceeding
against it by the company name.. That is what we believe
that Congress intended to do. It is to be observed that
the structure of the company under the laws of New York
is such that a judgment against it binds only the joint
property, National Bank v. Van Derwerker, 74 N. Y. 234,
and that it has other characteristics of separate being.
Westcolt v. Fargo, 61 N. Y. 542. Matter of Jones, 172
N. Y. 575. Hibbs v. Brown, 190 N. Y. 167. Indeed,
Article VIII of the constitution of the State, after providing that the term corporations as there used shall be
construed to include all joint stock companies, &c., having
any of the powers or privileges of corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships, as these companies
do, Mat'ter of Jones, 172 N. Y. 575, 579, goes on to declare
that all corporations may sue and be sued 'in like cases
as natural persons.' We do not refer to the law of New
York in order to argue that by itself it would suffice to
make applicable the principle of Liverpool & London Life
& Fire Ins. Co. v. Oliver, 10 Wall. 566. We refer to it
simply to show the semi-corporate standing that these
companies already had locally as well as in the popular
mind, and thus that the action of, Congress was natural
and to be expected, if we take its words to mean all that,
by construction they import.
Judgment reversed.
