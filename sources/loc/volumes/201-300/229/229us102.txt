229 U. S.

CHICAGO, ROCK ISLAND & PACIFIC RAILWAY
COMPANY v. DOWELL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.

No. 208.

Submitted April 14, 1913.-Decided May 26,1913.

QuWre, whether liability to a third person against the master may result
from the servant's neglect of some duty owing to the employer alone.
Positive acts of negligence on the part of an engineer while engaged
in his employer's business toward a fellow-servant, are acts of misfeasance for which he is primarily liable notwithstanding his contract
with his employer and the liability of the latter under the state

statute.
If plaintiff allege that the. concurrent negligence of both defendants
caused his injury, he may join them in one action; and if he do so the
fact that he might have sued them separately furnishes no ground
for removal.
Whether or not defendants are jointly liable depends on plaintiff's
averments in the statement of his cause of action, and it is a question
for the state court to decide.
If the state court so decides, a plaintiff may join joint tort-feasors even
though the liability of one is statutory and the liability of the other
rests on the common law.
While issues of fact arising on the controverted allegations in a petition
for removal are only triable in the Federal court, the state court may
deny the petition if it is insufficient on its face.
Mere averment that a resident defendant, in this case an employ6 of
small means, is fraudulently joined with a non-resident defendant of
undoubted responsibility for the purpose of preventing removal by
the latter, is not sufficient to raise an issue of fraud in the absence of
other averments of actual fraud. The motive of plaintiff in such a
case is immaterial; if the right of joinder exists he can exercise it.
83 Kansas, 562, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Removal Act and what constitutes a separable controversy
as to a non-resident defendant sued jointly with a resident
defendant, are stated in the opinion.

The petition for the removal of the suit to the United
States court should have been allowed, as the controversy
was separable.
The-State of Kansas prohibited the joinder of the several

MR.JUSTICE LURTON delivered the opinion of the court.
This writ of error is sued out to review a judgment in a
personal injury case because a petition to remove the case
to the Circuit Court of the United States is said to have
been erroneously denied.
The plaintiff, Albert M. Dowell, was a laborer in the
employ of the railroad company, his work being to remove
cinders and other debris from the tracks and yards of the
company in the town of Liberal, Kansas. Ile was a resident and citizen of that State. The railroad company
was a corporation of the States of Illinois and Iowa, but
not of Kansas. The plaintiff while engaged in his proper
work was run down by an engine, upon which one Ed.
Johnson was the engineer in control, sustaining serious
and permanent injuries.
To recover damages for his hurt, Dowell sued the railroad company and Johnson as jointly and severally liable.
Johnson was alleged to be, and was in fact, a citizen of the
State of Kansas. The railroad company in due time filed
its petition and bond, to remove the action of the plaintiff
against it to the Circuit Court of the United States, as
presenting a separable controversy between the plaintiff
and the corporation, which could be tried out an(d determined without the presence of its co-defendant, Johunson.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

It also averred that Johnson was a man of no means, who
had been joined as a defendant "for the sole and fraudulent purpose of defeating and preventing" the removal
of the case by the non-resident railroad company to the
Circuit Court of the United States. The application was
denied and the suit was tried before a jury upon the issues
made, which found for the plaintiff, against both of the
defendants in the sum of $15,000, for which sum a judgment was entered. This judgment was later affirmed by
the Supreme Court of the State. Dowell v. Railroad Company, 83 Kansas, 562. The only error assigned in this
court is that the Kansas court erred in denying the application for removal.
Shortly stated the plaintiff's grounds for recovery, as
averred in his petition, were these:
a. That the engine which ran over him was old, worn
and defective. "That it leaked steam into its cylinder and
would not stand when left alone, but would move without
the intervention of human or outside agency. That the
appliances and machinery of said engine for starting and
stopping same were so defective that the same would
start and stop without reference to said machinery, and
would not respond to the operation of said machinery."
That it was without sufficient or'safe driving wheel brakes,
all of which was averred to be well known to the defendants and not known to the plaintiff.
b. That the defendant Johnson in charge and control
of
with
plaintiff,
the said engine at the time of its collision
"was incompetent, unskilled and unfit to discharge the
duties as an engineer at the time he was employed, . .
as said railway company well knew, and that he has been
unskilled, unfit and incompetent as the railway company
well knew, but all of which this plaintiff was at all times
ignorant."
c. "That the injury to plaintiff was the direct and
proximate result of the unfitness and incompetency of

CHI., R. I. & PAC. RY. v. DOWELL.
229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the defendant, Ed. Johnson, and of the negligence and
carelessness of said Ed. Johnson in carelessly, recklessly
and needlessly running said engine upon and against the
said plaintiff, and of the careless failure of said Ed. Johnson
in neglecting to use proper precaution to observe and
avoid running upon and injuring the said plaintiff at the
time and place in question, and in the carelessness of the
defendant Railway Company in employing the said Ed.
Johnson as engineer and in retaining him and allowing
him to act as engineer at the time and place in question,
and in the carelessness of the defendant Railway Compapy
in knowingly retaining and using said defective engine At
said time and place, and in carelessly failing to take proper
precaution to prevent injury to said plaintiff at said time
and place while engaged in the discharge of his duty as
employ6 of said defendant Railway Company; and each
and every act of omission and commission of the defendants and of each of them as above, were the joint, proximate and concurrent cause of said injury, and each of
said acts of the said defendants materially, concurrently
and jointly contributed to the injuries of said plaintiff,
and plaintiff says that he was without fault or negligence
in the premises."
The claim of a right to have the cause removed to the
Circuit Court of the United States was that the requisite
diversity of citizenship existed as between the plaintiff
and the petitioning railroad company, and that there
existed as between them a separable controversy.
But if the plaintiff alleges that the concurrent negligence
of the railroad company and its employ6, Johnson, was
the cause of his injury, he has a right to join them in one
action. If he elects to do so, it supplies no ground for
removal because he might have sued them separately.

Railway v. Thompson, 200 U. S. 206.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

The petition of the jilaintiff below was in substance that
the defective character of the engine, the unfitness and
in'ompetency of Johnson, the engineer controlling it, and
his negligence and carelessness in needlessly running the
engine over him without the exercise of proper care and
caution, "concurrently and jointly contributed to the
injuries of said plaintiff," who was at the time in the exercise of due care.
But it is said that some of the matters charged against
Johnson consisted in acts of non-feasance, and that an
employer is not liable to a third person for conduct of
that character.
Whether liability to a third person against a master
may result from the servant's neglect of some duty owing
to the employer alone, may be debatable. But we need
not consider that question, since the plaintiff's declaration
averred positive acts of negligence on the part of Johnson
toward the plaintiff, namely, that while engaged in the
company's service in the movement of the engine, he did
not exercise that degree of care and skill which he was
bound to exercise toward another servant engaged upon
the tracks in the company's work. This was an act of
misfeasance, for which he would be primarily liable, notwithstanding his contract relation to the employer and
the liability of the latter for his negligent act under
the .Kansas statute abolishing the common law rule in
respect of fellow-servants.
The state court held that the allegations of the petition
stated a case of concurring negligence of master and servant for which they might be jointly sued. That court,
also, aside from any positive acts of negligence, such as
the retention of an incompetent servant in the control
and management of an unmanageable engine, must be
regarded as necessarily holding that under the law and
practice of the State, it was admissible to jointly sue the
company with the servant for whose negligent act it was

liable. Southern Railway v. Miller, 217 U. S. 209; Alabama &c. Ry. v. Thompson, supra.
Whether there was a joint liability or not was a question
to be determined upon the averments of the plaintiff's
statement of his cause of action, and is a question for
the state court to decide. Railroad v. Thompson, supra;
Illinois Central Railroad v. Sheegog, 215 U. S. 308.
That the liability of the railroad company was statutory
in so far as the common law fellow-servant rule had been
abolished by statute, and the liability of Johnson dependent upon common law, was held by the Kansas Court
not to preclude a joinder. "It is enough," said the court
below, "if the concurrent acts of negligence of each contributed to the injury inflicted upon the plaintiff." Southern Railway v. Miller, supra.
But the petition for removal averred that the sole
reason in joining Johnson was for the fraudulent purpose
of defeating the right of the railroad company to remove
the action. It is further insisted that this averment presented a question of fact which could be tried only in
the Circuit Court of the United States.
Allegations of fact, if controverted, arising upon such a
petition, are triable, only in the court to which it is sought
to be removed. Illinois CentralRailroadv. Sheegog, supra.
But if the petition was insufficient upon its face, the state
court might for that reason deny it. It is well settled that
the mere averment that a particular defendant had been
joined for the fraudulent purpose of defeating the right
of removal which would otherwise exist, is not in law sufficient. If the plaintiff had a right to elect whether he
would join two joint tort-feasors, or sue them separately,
his motive in joining them is not fraudulent, unless the
mere epithet "fraudulent" is backed up by some other
charge or statement of fact. Illinois Central Railroad Co.
v. Sheegog, supra.
Neither did the allegation that the defendant Johnson

was a man of small means and the responsibility of the
railroad company unquestioned, serve to show any actual
fraudulent purpose in joining him as a defendant. If the
plaintiff had a cause of action which was joint and had
elected to sue both tort-feasors in one action, his motive
in doing so is of no importance, Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry.

NORFOLK & WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v.
EARNEST.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 153.

Argued January 29, 30, 1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

The truth of evidence tending to show a custom as to where switchmen
walk in a railroad yard is for the jury to determine; and if true it is
the duty of an engineer, in the exercise of ordinary care to watch
for a switchman whom he knows is in the usual locality and in front
of his engine.
It is not error to refuse an instruction as to assumption of risk which
is couched in such sweeping terms that it could not enlighten the
jury as to the particular phase of the case to which it is deemed applicable.
Fairness to the court requires one objecting to a particular part of the
charge as misleading to call special attention to the words in order
that the court may either modify or explain them.
An instruction that contributory negligence of the employ6 goes by
way of diminution of damages, held not error because the statute
says that in such a case the jury must diminish the damages, it appearing that the words objected to followed an instruction that the
