OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

298 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The writ of certiorari was granted in this case to resolve
a conflict between the decision below' and one by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.2
The question is whether, under the Revenue Acts of
1926 and 1928, a taxpayer who purchases cumulative
non-voting preferred shares of a corporation upon which
a dividend is subsequently paid in common voting shares,
must, upon a sale or other disposition of the preferred
shares, apportion their cost between preferred and common for the purpose of determining gain or loss.
The petitioner, in 1924 and 1926, purchased preferred
stock of Columbia Steel Corporation. The company's
articles of incorporation provided that holders of preferred stock should receive annual dividends of seven
dollars a share in cash or, at the company's option, one
share of common stock for each share of preferred. Dividends on the preferred were to be paid in full before. any
could be paid on the common; the common had voting
-rights, the preferred none. The preferred was redeemable 'at $105 per share, plus accrued dividends; and
upon dissolution or liquidatiorl was entitled to preferential payment of $100 per share, plus accrued dividends,
and no more. The common alone was entitled in such
evernt to the assets of the corporation remaining after
payment of the preferred.
In each of the years 1925 to 1928, inclusive, the company had a surplus sufficient to pay the preferred dividends in cash, but elected to pay them in common stock.
The petitioner received, in each of those years, shares
of common stock as dividends on her preferred. In 1930
the corporation redeemed its preferred stock at $105 per

share. In computing the profit realized by the petitioner the Commissioner allocated to the common stock
so received, in each instance, a proportionate amount of
the cost of the preferred stock. He thereby decreased the
resulting cost basis per share and increased the gain.
The Board of Tax Appeals reversed, holding that the dividends were taxable income, were not stock dividends
within the meaning of the Revenue Acts,3 and their receipt did not reduce the cost basis of the preferred stock.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board and approved the Commissioner's action.
The petitioner contends, first, that the dividends she
received were not stock dividends exempted from taxation by the revenue acts; and, secondly, if exempted,
they were none the less income and cannot be treated
as returns of capital in computing capital gain or loss.
The respondent answers that the distributions were stock
dividends because made in the capital stock of the corporation and come within the plain meaning of the provisions exempting stock dividends from income tax; accordingly, the Treasury regulations have consistently and
continuously treated them as returns of capital, and required the original cost to be apportioned between the
shares originally acquired and those distributed as dividends to obtain the cost basis for the calculation of gain
or loss. We hold that the dividends were income and
may not be treated as returns of capital.
The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed an income tax on
dividends.4 In Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, it was
held that where a corporation declared a dividend on its
common stock, in the form of common stock, the dividend was not income within the intendment of the act.

shall not be subject to tax."

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

298 U. S.

The Revenue Act of 1916 provided that a stock dividend
should be considered income to the amount of its cash
value.5 In Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, it was
decided that a dividend in the corporation's common
stock paid to the then common stockholders, was not
income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment
and therefore the effort to tax such dividends exceeded
the power granted by the Amendment. It was said that
such a dividend, was not income because, by its payment,
no severance of corporate assets was accomplished and
the preexisting proportionate interests of the stockholders remained unaltered. After the decision the
Treasury revoked regulations to 'the effect that a dividend paid in the corporation's stock is income and issued
amended regulations, broadly phrased, to exempt all
income in the form of stock dividends, whether the dividend shares be of the same class as those theretofore
held by the stockholder or of a different class, and prescribing the method of allocating the original cost as between the old and the new stock for purposes of calculating gain or loss upon realization. Subsequently Congress adopted the Revenue Act of 1921 which provided,
in § 201 (d): "A stock dividend shall not be subject to
tax . .

."

' The reason for the exemption was the deci-

sion in Eisner v. Macomber, supra. The reports of both
the House and the Senate Committees dealing with the
bill state that the act "modifies the definition of dividends in existing law by exempting stock dividends from
the income tax, as required by the decision of the
Supreme Court in Eisner v. Macomber (252 U. S.189)."

1059.
- 42 Stat. 227, 228. The same provision was repeated in all subsequent revenue acts; Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, § 201 (f);
Revenue Acts of 1928, 1932 and 1934, § 115 (f).

Opinion of the Court.

Although Eisner v. Macomber affected only the taxation of dividends declared in the same stock as that
presently held by the taxpayer, the Treasury gave the
decision a broader interpretation which Congress followed
in the Act of 1921. Soon after the passage of that Act,
this court pointed out the distinction between a stock
dividend which worked no change in the corporate entity,
the same interest in the same corporation being represented after the distribution by more shares of precisely
the same character, and such a dividend where there had
either been changes of corporate identity or a change in
the nature of the shares issued as dividends Whereby the
proportional interest of the stockholder after, the distribution was essentially different from his former interest.8
Nevertheless the successive statutes and Treasury regulations respecting taxation of stock dividends remained
unaltered. 9 We give great weight to an administrative
interpretation long and consistently followed, particularly when the Congress, presumably with that construction in mind, has regnacted the statute without change.1"
The question here, however, is not merely of our adopting the administrative construction but whether it should
be adopted if in effect it converts an income tax into a
capital levy.
We are dealing solely with an income tax act. Under
our decisions the payment of a dividend of new common
shares, conferring no different rights or interests than
did the old,-the new certificates, plus the old, representing the same proportionate interest in the net assets

of the corporation as did the old,-does not constitute
the receipt of income by the stockholder. On the other
hand, where a stock dividend gives the stockholder an
interest different from that which his former stock holdings represented he receives income. The latter type of
dividend is taxable as income under the Sixteenth Amendment. Whether Congress has taxed it as of the time of
its receipt, is immaterial for present purposes.
The relevant capital gains provisions of the Revenue
Act of 1928 are § 111 (a):
the gain from the sale or other disposition of
property shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the basis provided in Section 113 .
and § 113:
"The basis for determining the gain or loss from the
sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913, shall be the cost of such property; . .
(with exceptions having no relevancy here)."2
The property disposed of was the petitioner's preferred
stock. In plain terms the statute directs the subtraction
of its cost from the proceeds of its redemption, if the
latter sum be the greater. But we are told that Treasury
Regulations 1 long in force require an allocation of the
original cost between the preferred stock purchased and
the common stock received as dividend. And it is said
that while no provision of the statute authorizes a specific regulation respecting this matter, the general power
conferred by the law to make appropriate regulations
comprehends the subject. Where the act uses ambiguous
terms, or is of doubtful construction, a clarifying regulation or one indicating the method of its application to
specific cases not only is permissible but is to be given
great weight by the courts. And the same principle

governs where the statute merely expresses a general
rule and invests the Secretary of the Treasury with
authority to promulgate regulations appropriate to its
enforcement. But where, as in this case, the provisions
of the act are unambiguous, and its directions, specific,
there is no power to amend it by regulation." Congress
having clearly and specifically declared that in taxing
income arising from capital gain the cost of the asset disposed of shall be the measure of the income, the Secretary of the Treasury is without power by regulatory
amendment to add a provision that income derived from
the capital asset shall be used to reduce cost.
The judgment is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE and MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO are of
the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.

The meaning of the Act of Congress exempting stock
dividends from taxation as income at the time of distribution has had a practical construction through adminEven
istrative action and legislative acquiescence.
though ,the meaning may have been uncertain in the beginning, it has now become fixed in accordance with long
continued practice. Morrissey v. Commissioner, 296 U. S.
344, 355; Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., 296 U. S. 378,
384. This is riot denied in the opinion of the court. Congress did not intend, however, when it refused to tax the
newly acquired shares as income in praesenti, to exclude
them from taxation in futuro if disposed of at a profit.
A tax upon a gainful use either of capital or of income,
when the gain is fully realized, is a true tax upon income
and not a capital levy. The question is merely one as to
how the profit shall be computed. Following the analogy

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

Nos. 767 and 768.

Argued May 1, 4, 1936.-Decided May 18, 1936.

1. In an accounting to a patent-owner by an infringer who acted
in good faith factory losses incurred by the infringer as a neces'ary or normal incident to the completion of sales effected at a
gain are deducted from the profits. P. 452.
2. In reckoning the profits made by the infringers in this case from
sales of patented shatter-proof glass, allowance was properly made
for the cost of labor and material wasted without fault in the
manufacturing process, but no allowance should have been made
for the cost of labor and material that entered into the manufacture of glass that was returned by customers for defects discovered
after sale. Crosby Valve Co. v. Safety Valve Co., 141 U. S. 441,
considered. Pp. 453, 455.
3. In-such an accounting, fabricated materials sold by one infringer
to bnother and used by the other in completing the infringing
product should be set down at cost of manufacture. So held
where the contributing infringer could not have sold the materials
in his business, and allowance of a higher value would have meant
a profit to him from his own wrong-doing. P. 456.
4. In such an accounting, an infringer cannot have compensation,
in the nature of royalties, for-savings effected by use of his own
patented devices in manufacturing the infringing product. P. 457.
