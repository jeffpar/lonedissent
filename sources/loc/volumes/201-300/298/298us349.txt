APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 312.

Argued January 14, 15, 1936. Reargued March 3, 4,
1936.-Decided May 18, 1936.

1. The function of the Interstate Commerce Commissioh in prescribing divisions of joint rates under § 15 (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act, is a legislative function. P. 356.
2. Exertion of the power of the Commission in that regard is conditioned upon its finding, after a full hearing, that the divisions in
force do not, or in the future will not, comply with the standards
specified by § 1 (4). Id.
3. In proceedings to determine and prescribe divisions, the Commission is governed by §§ 1 (4), 15 (6), and 15a (2) of the Act;
it is not required or authorized to investigate or determine whether
the joint rates are reasonable or confiscatory; its duty is to make
the divisions fair, and this does not depend upon the level of
the rates or the amounts of revenue to be divided. P. 357.
4. When made in accordance with the Act, the Commission's orders
prescribing divisions are equivalent to Acts of Congress requiring
the carriers to serve for the amounts so specified. Id.
5. An order of the Commission prescribing divisions, or continuing
them in force, may be declared void and its enforcement permanently enjoined at the suit of a carrier whose share of the joint
rate proves to be non-compensatory, even though the joint rate
itself be not confiscatory. Id.
6. An order of the Commission denying relief to a carrier complaining under § 15 (6) of the Act of unjust and inequitable divisions
of joint rates, operates to require service under them, and though
negative in form is in effect affirmative. P. 358.
7. An order of the Commission sustaining divisions of joint rates as
just, reasonable and equitable, under § 15 (6) of the Act, is not
arbitrary and in excess of the Commission's power because based
in part on the financial needs of the carriers. Id.
8. In determining, under § 15 (6) of the Act, the divisions of joint
rates on a particular class of traffic, the Commission may consider not only the revenues, operating expenses, taxes and returns
attributable to that particular traffic, but also those that are

attributable to all the operations of the railroad properties of the
carriers. P. 360.
9. A report and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission from
which some of the members dissent has the same legal effect as
if supported by all. P. 361.
10. Findings of the Commission in fixing divisions under § 15 (6)
of the Act and its determination of the significance of the particular facts found, held conclusive though too much weight was
given to the financial needs of carriers. P. 362.
11. Where the application of carriers to the Interstate Commerce
Commission for just, reasonable and equitable divisions of joint
rates, under § 15 (6) of the Act, raised no question of confiscation, held that the findings in its report could not be construed as
addressed to that issue. P. 363.
12. Denial by the Interstate Commerce Commission of a petition
for rehearing of an order sustaining divisions of joint rates, the
petition raising for the first time the issue of confiscation,-held
to amount to a command by the Commission that, notwithstanding their invocation of constitutional protection, the petitioning
carriers must make the adjustment ordered, involving the payment
of enormous sums and the use of their property to serve the
public for the compensation specified in the order. P. 363.
13. Upon the question whether the divisions of joint rates prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission constitute just
compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, the
findings of the Commission could not constitutionally be made
conclusive. The District Court may receive evidence in addition
to what was before the Commission and weigh all the evidence
and make its own findings, in deciding the constitutional question.
St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, ante, p. 38. P. 364.
14. A carrier petitioning the Commission for just, reasonable and
equitable divisions of joint rates--the reasonableness of the rates
themselves not being in question-is not obliged to raise in advance the question whether the existing divisions are confiscatory.
Held that in this case the complaining carriers who sought in
vain, by petition for rehearing, to have the Commission inquire
into the alleged confiscatory results of its order, were entitled to
seek judicial relief. P. 369.
15. Evidence held insufficient to prove with the requisite certainty
that the divisions of joint rates on transportation of citrus fruit
have proved or will prove to be confiscatory. P. 372.

able. It prescribed "proportionals" which were added
to the gathering rates to make joint rates applicable over
through routes to destinations. Included in the proportionals were stated amounts, called "specifics," per box
of estimated weight of 80 pounds to cover hauls beyond
the gateways. These specifics went to the northern lines
and constituted their share of the joint rates.'"
In 1915 the commission allowed the carriers in official
territory a general rate increase of five per cent.," and in
1917 granted an additional 15 per cent." These increases
were applicable generally to interterritorial hauls. The
specifics for northern lines were not advanced. In 1918,
while the carriers were under federal control, the director
general raised rates 25 per cent. The divisions to the
southern and northern lines were increased by that ratio.
In 1920, after the railroads were returned to their owners,
the commission granted to carriers in the southern group
a general rate increase of 25 per cent. and to those in
the eastern group, which included the northern lines here
involved, an advance of 40 per cent. It also authorized
charges for interterritorial hauls to be raised by 331/3 .13
While that was enough to increase the southern carriers'
shares by 25 per cent. and those of the northern lines by
40 per cent. in harmony with the respective rate increases, each group of carriers received divisions raised by
331/3 per cent. The northern lines emphasize the fact
that if their divisions had kept step with rates in that
territory they would have been increased four times,
whereas in fact their divisions did not share at all in
either of the first two advances and only partially in
the fourth, i.e., 331/3 instead of 40 per cent.

Opinion of the Court.

The joint rates prescribed by the commission's order
of July 10, 1928, were specified amounts per 100 pounds.
The assumed weight of 80 pounds per box to which were
applied the specifics to cover hauls of the northern carriers was too low. While the commission failed definitely to find actual average weight per box, its report
distinctly indicates that it was about 90 pounds.1" After
the taking effect of the new rates the northern, lines in
trunk line and New England territories took, out of the
freight charges they collected, and retained as their divisions per 100 pounds 25 per cent more than the specific
per box. The northern lines in central territory adopted
90 pounds as the basis on which to make conversion of
the rate per box to rate per 100 pounds. The increase
was slightly over 11.1 per cent.
The divisions were not satisfactory to either group of
carriers. November 22, 1930, the Atlantic Coast Line
and other southern carriers filed their complaint " requesting the commission to condemn the divisions of
citrus fruit rates to trunk line and New England territories, then being received by them, as a violation of the
requirements of § 1 (4), to prescribe just, reasonable and
equitable divisions in accordance with § 13 (6), and to
require adjustment and refund to be made by northern
lines in respect of transportation subsequent to the coin..
plaint. Ja"nuary 3, 1931, the commission instituted a
general investigation "Gin respect of divisions of joint
interterritorial rates between official and southern territory. April 20, 1931, the northern lines filed a crosscomplaint. To prevent (uplication, the general investigation, so far as it concerned divisions of rates on citrus
fruit in central territory, was set for hearing on the same
record as the complaint of the southern lines in respect

of divisions of rates to trunk line and New England territory. 7 Thus the issue concerning divisions of citrus fruit
rates from Florida to destinations in official territory was
segregated from the broader controversy. The order here
assailed. assigns to appellants divisions yielding more
than did those accepted by them for a long time prior to
the taking effect of the rate order of July 10, 1928.
There was before the commission no question as to the
validity of the joint rates. There was no claim that they
were not sufficient to cover "out-of-pocket costs," i. e.,
the amount by which performance of the service covered
by the rates caused operating expenses and taxes to be
higher than otherwise they would have been. Nor was
it suggested that they were confiscatory, i. e., not sufficient to cover operating expenses and taxes justly apportionable to the traffic plus an amount reasonably sufficient in the circumstances to constitute just compensation for the use of the carriers' property in that service.
The division of presumably reasonable rates was the only
problem before the commission. Neither complaint alleged that existing divisions were not more than sufficient
to cover the out-of-pocket costs or that they were confiscatory.
The commission was required to decide whether, in
respect of the joint rates, the carriers had discharged the
duties imposed upon them by § 1 (4), i. e., "to establish
just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof as between the carriers . . . participating therein which shall
not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating
carriers." The prescribing of divisions is a legislative
function.1 8 Exertion of that power by the commission
is conditioned upon its finding after a full hearing that

the divisions then in force do not, or in the future will
not, comply with the specified standards. In proceedings to determine and prescribe divisions the commission
is governed by §§ 1 (4), 15 (6), 15a (2); it is not required
or authorized to investigate or determine whether the
joint rates are reasonable or confiscatory. The question
whether it complied with the requirements of the Act
does not depend upon the level of the rates or the
amounts of revenue to be divided. The purpose of the
provisions just cited is to empower and require the coinmission to make divisions that colloquially may be said
to be fair.'"
But this does not imply that, without regard to
amount, the carriers are bound to accept prescribed divisions. Congress is without power, directly or through
the commission, to require them to serve the public at
rates that are confiscatory. When made in accordance
with the Act, the commission's orders prescribing divisions are the equivalent of Acts of Congress requiring the
carriers to serve for the amounts specified. Taken, as
they must be, in connection with the duties to the public
imposed by law upon the carriers, they command service
and for that purpose expropriate the use of carriers' property. If when made the prescribed divisions are or later
shall become less than just compensation, the carriers
may not be required to serve therefor .2' And, if after
appropriate effort they fail to obtain divisions of nonconfiscatory joint rates that do constitute just compensation for their services including the use of their properties,

the carriers may by suit in equity have the order prescribing, or requiring to be kept in force, the challenged
divisions adjudged void and its enforcement permanently
enjoined.2 Section 15 (6) requires the commission on
complaint of any participating carrier to determine
whether existing divisions are just, reasonable and equitable and, if not, to prescribe others that do comply with
the law. Its denial of relief from existing divisions operates to direct service under them. Though negative in
form, the order of denial is affirmative in effect. In some
circumstances carriers may accept rates or divisions that
do not yield enough to cover operating expenses and taxes
that are fairly apportionable to the service plus a reasonable return for the use of their railroads. If revenues
yielded exceed the amounts by which operating expenses
are increased on account of the service covered by such
charges, then legitimately the carriers' net earnings may
thus be enhanced. When conditions permit, such rates
or divisions may be established and kept in force without
detriment to competing carriers, shippers, other transportation or the public. Just as an owner may sell his property for less than the amount he would be entitled to
have upon expropriation, so may carriers, conditions
warranting it, render service for less than, by exertion of
sovereign power, they could be compelled to accept.
1. Appellants maintain that the order is arbitrary and
in excess of statutory power "because the commission
erroneously subordinated all matters, which under § 15
(6) . . . it is required to consider to the element of
southern lines' supposed 'financial need.' "
In substance, Congress by that paragraph authorizes
the commission to take into account all that is relevant
to the ascertainment of fair divisions. While presumed

valid, its order may be annulled if shown to rest on a misconstruction of the Act or upon inadequate or unsupported findings of fact.22 The commission alone is authorized to decide upon weight of evidence or significance
of facts. There is no single test by which "just," "reasonable" or "equitable" divisions may be ascertained; no
fact or group of facts may be used generally as a measure
by which to determine what division will conform to
these standards. Considerations that reasonably guide
to decision in one case may rightly be deemed to have
little or no bearing in other cases. Error as to the weight
to be given financial needs, operating costs or other material facts is not a misconstruction of the Act.
The report shows that the commission received much
evidence bearing upon the standards set by § 15 (6) to
govern it in making the divisions. Appellants' claim
that the order rests exclusively upon the southern lines'
financial needs is negatived by the record. Many other
facts were shown to have been presented and considered.
There is no requirement that the commission specify the
weight given to any item of evidence or fact or disclose
mental operations by which its decisions are reached. 2
Useful precision in respect of either would be impossible.

nitely to ascertain the weight assigned to any fact or
argument in prescribing the divisions. We find no support for appellants' claim.
2. Appellants also maintain that the order is in excess
of power granted by the Act because, as they assert,
the commission considered rates of return from the carriers' entire operations on all their railroad property
instead of fair return from transportation of citrus fruit
on the use fairly attributable to that service.
More specifically, the substance of their claim is that
the commission transgressed or disregarded the clause
of § 15 (6) which requires that it "shall give due consideration, among other things, to . . . the amount of

revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation. . .

."

Their conltention assumes and depends upon

a construction of the quoted clause that would limit
consideration of the return to services covered by the
divisions under consideration and prohibit taking into
account returns from all service. But that is not the
icaiiing of the clause. The language, "property held for
and used in the service of transportation," is broad
enough to include all carrier property. It requires no
discussion to demonstrate that § 15 (6) authorizes the
commission to take into account and give due weight
to revenues from all transportation service, the operating
expenses and taxes chargeable to the same and the
amounts available as compensation for the use of all
carrier property. And unquestionably the paragraph also
empowers the commission to take into account the revenues, expenses, taxes and returns attributable to the
service covered by the divisions under consideration.
The record shows that the commission received and considered evidence in relation to both these matters of
fact.

B. & 0. R. CM. v. UNITED STATES.
349

Opinion of the Court.

The question whether the carriers in the southern or
northern groups were in the worse financial position was
a close and difficult one. After full hearing, the commission decided that the needs of the southern lines were
greater. It appears to have given much weight to that
fact. Four members dissented and filed an opinion in
which they compared and commented on the prescribed
divisions in substance as follows:
For a haul of 600 miles the northern factor is 87 and
the southern 161. The latter is 85 per cent. higher than
the former. The average hauls are about 825 miles in
the south and 375 miles in the north. For these distances
the factors are 194 for the south and 60 for the north, or
0.235 per mile for the longer haul in the south and 0.160
per mile for the shorter haul in the north. The advantage per mile is 47 per cent. for the south. Taking into
consideration the respective lengths of haul and the fact
that divisions, like rates, should decrease per mile as the
length of haul increases, this 47 per cent. checks well
within the 85 per cent. in the first test.
For the average southern haul of 825 miles the southern factor is 94 per cent. of the corresponding first-class
rate, whereas the northern factor is 62.5 per cent. Yet
the southern class rates average more than 30 per cent.
higher than the eastern class rates, and the commission
has several times found that this difference is not fully
justified by transportation conditions.
Transportation conditions in Florida are less favorable
than in the south generally; but a Florida arbitrary is
added to the rate. It is deducted before proration and
added to the southern division of the balance of the joint
rate. Gathering expense is high but so is delivery expense at destination. The commission was obliged to
lean heavily on history and on the fact that, while both
sets of carriers are badly off financially, the southern lines
appear to be worse off than the northern. Historical

considerations were not entitled to much weight. While
financial need is important, the report and order of the
commission gave it too much weight.
The wide difference of opinion among the members
may suggest doubt as to some basic findings of fact, but
it gives no support to appellants' claim that the commission acted arbitrarily or in excess of powers granted by
the Act. The legal effect of the challenged report and
order is the same as if supported by all members of the
colnmission.24 Although it may be plain that, if considered without regard to the facts other than relative
transportation and costs of the service, the divisions
would seem extremely favorable to the southern lines,
the commission's findings based on evidence and its
determination as to the significance of pertinent facts
found are conclusive. Appellants' contention cannot be
sustained.
3. Before taking up appellants' claim of confiscation,
some preliminary questions require consideration.
At the trial the United States and commission moved
that no evidence be received other than that contained
in the record before the commission. The court denied
the motion. Counsel for the United States and commission do not here claim that the ruling was erroneous.
But it has been suggested that the trial court should not
have received evidence other than that introduced before
the commission; that it was not permitted to make findings but was bound to accept those of the commission if
supported by evidence. Decisions in lower federal courts

touching the points thus raised are not harmonious.
Their determination has an important bearing upon the
decision here to be made. It is therefore necessary to
decide what, in respect of admission and consideration
of evidence, should have been the scope of the trial in
the district court. 6
There is no statute that can be held to limit as suggested trial of an issue of confiscation. No question as
to compensation in the constitutional sense was raised
by the complaints to the commission. The issues there
concerned* only the fairness of divisions. Prior to the
taking effect of the order, appellants filed a petition for
rehearing in which they claimed that its enforcement
would confiscate their property; they then made substantially the same contentions as they make in this suit and
sought opportunity to support them by evidence in order
to obtain the commission's findings of fact and decision
upon the question of confiscation. But the commission
That denial of hearing
denied their application.
amounted to a command of the commission that, notwithstanding their petition to it invoking constitutional
protection, appellants must make the specified adjustment involving the payment of enormous sums and use
their property to serve the public for the compensation
specified in the order. As the carriers' application to the
commission for just, reasonable and equitable divisions
under § 15 (6) raised no question of confiscation, its
findings in the report may not be construed as addressed
to that issue.

4. There is a wide and fundamental difference between
the question whether the commission, in prescribing divisions found by it to be just, reasonable and equitable,
complied with the procedural requirements of the Act,
and whether, if enforced against objecting carriers, the
order will confiscate their property. The commission's
findings of fact in the field first mentioned, if based on
evidence, are conclusive. But, upon the question
whether prescribed divisions constitute just. compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, Congress is without power conclusively to bind the carriers.
As the Congress itself could not be, so it cannot make
its agents be, the final judge of its own power under the
Constitution. Congress has no power to make final
determipation of just compensation or to prescribe what
constitutes due process of law for its ascertainment. 7
In Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134
U. S. 418, this court held repugnant to the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a Minnesota
statute construed to provide that rates prescribed by the
state commission shall be final and conclusive as to what
are equal and reasonable charges and that as to reasonableness there can be no judicial inquiry. The court
said (p. 458): "The question of the reasonableness of a
rate of charge for transportation by a railroad company,
involving as it does the element of reasonableness both as
regards the company and as regards the public, is eminently a question for judicial investigation, requiring due
process of law for its determination. If the company
is deprived of the power of charging reasonable rates for
the use of its property, and such deprivation takes place
in the absence of an investigation by judicial machinery,
it is deprived of the lawful use of its property, and thus,

in substance and effect, of the property itself, without
due process of law and in violation of the Constitution
of the United States."
In Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148
U. S. 312, this court held repugnant to the Fifth Amendment an Act of Congress purporting to exclude an element of value. It said (p. 327): "By this legislation,
Congress seems to have assumed the right to determine
what shall be the measure of compensation. But this
is a judicial and not a legislative question. The legislature may determine what private property is needed for
public purposes--that is a question of a political and
legislative character; but when the taking has been
ordered, then the question of compensation is judicial.
It does not rest with the public, taking the property,
through Congress or the legislature, its representative, to
say what compensation shall be paid, or even what shall
be the rule of compensation. The Constitution has declared that just compensation shall be paid, and the ascertainment of that is a judicial inquiry."
In Reagan v. Farmers'Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362,
a fully considered case presenting the question whether a
circuit court of the United States had power to enjoin
enforcement of confiscatory state-made railroad rates, this
court, upon an abundance of authority found in the earlier
decisions, held that it had. The opinion declares
(p. 399): "These cases all support the proposition -that
while it is not the province of the courts to enter upon
the merely administrative duty of framing a tariff of
rates for carriage, it is within the scope of judicial power
and a part of judicial duty to restrain anything which, in
the form of a regulation of rates, operates to deny to the
owners of property invested in the business of transportation that equal protection which is the constitutional
right of all owners of other property. There is nothing

new or strange in this. It has always been a part of the
judicial function to determine whether the act of one
party (whether that party be a single individual, an organized body, or the public as a whole) operates to divest
the other party of any rights of person or property. In
every constitution is the guarantee against the taking of
private property for public purposes without just compensation. The equal protection of the laws which, by
the Fourteenth Amendment, no State can deny to the
individual, forbids legislation, in whatever form it may
be enacted, by which the property of one individual is,
without compensation, wrested from him for the benefit
of another, or of the public. This, as has been often
observed, is a. government of law, and not a government
of men, and it must never be forgotten that under such
a government, with its constitutional limitations and
guarantees, the forms of law and the machinery of government, with all their reach and power, must in their
actual workings stop on the hither side of the unnecessary and uncompensated taking or destruction of any
private property, legally acquired and legally held."
Seaboard Air Line v. United States, 261 U. S. 299, was
a suit to recover just compensation for expropriated
land. A jury found value at the time of the taking. The
district court entered judgment for that amount with interest from the date of taking. The Circuit Court of
Appeals held the owner not entitled to interest. Here its
judgment was reversed and that of the district court
affirmed. We said (p. 306): "The Constitution safeguards the right [to just compensation] and § 10 of the
Lever Act directs payment. The rule above referred to,
that in the absence of agreement to pay or statute allowing it [Jud. Code, § 177; 28 U. S. C., § 284] the United
States will not be held liable for interest on unpaid accounts and claims, does not apply here. The requirement

Opinion of the Court.

that 'just compensation' shall be paid is comprehensive
and includes all elements and no specific command to
include interest is necessary when interest or its equivalent
is a part of such compensation."
United States v. New River Collieries Co., 262 U. S.
341, involved the question of pay for requisitioned coal.
We said (pp. 343-4): "The ascertainment of compensation is a judicial function, and no power exists in any
other department of the government to declare what the
compensation shall be, or to prescribe any binding rule
in that regard." See Davis v. Newton Coal Co., 267
U. S. 292, 301. Phelps v. United States, 274 U. S. 341.
In West v. C. & P. Tel. Co., 295 U. S. 662, called
upon to decide whether the order of a state commission
prescribing charges for telephone service was confiscatory, we said (p. 671): "When the property itself is
taken by the exertion of the power of eminent domain,
just compensation is its value at the time of the taking.
So, where by legislation prescribing rates or charges the
use of the property is taken, just compensation assured
by these constitutional provisions is a reasonable rate of
return upon that value."
St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, ante,
p. 38, presented the question whether an order of the
Secretary of Agriculture prescribing rates for stockyards
services was confiscatory. The case was submitted to
the district court upon the evidence contained in the
record before the Secretary. This court was called on
to decide whether the district court was required to
weigh the evidence. We answered affirmatively. We
said (p. 51): "When the legislature acts directly, its
action is subject to judicial scrutiny and determination
in order to prevent the transgression of these [constitutional] limits of power. The legislature cannot preclude that scrutiny or determination by any declaration

or legislative finding. Legislative declaration or finding
is necessarily subject to independent judicial review
upon the facts and the law by courts of competent jurisdiction to the end that the Constitution as the supreme
law of the land may be maintained. Nor can the legislature escape the constitutional limitation by authorizing its agent to make findings that the agent has kept
within that limitation. . . . It is said that we can
retain judicial authority to examine the weight of evidence when the question concerns the right of petsonal
liberty. But if this be so, it is not because we are privileged to perform our judicial duty in that case and for
reasons of convenience to disregard it in others. The
principle applies when rights either of person or of property are protected by constitutional restrictions. Under
our system there is no warrant for the view that the
judicial power of a competent court can be circumscribed
by any legislative arrangement designed to give effect to
administrative action going beyond the limits of constitutional authority."
The just compensation clause may not be evaded or
impaired by any form of legislation. Against the objection of the owner of private property taken for public
use, the Congress may not directly or through any legislative agency-finally determine the amount that is safeguarded to him by that clause. If as to the value of his
property the owner accepts legislative or administrative
determinations or challenges them merely upon the
ground that they were not made in accordance with
statutes governing a subordinate agency, no constitutional question arises. But, when he appropriately invokes the just compensation clause, he is entitled to a
judicial determination of the amount. The due process
clause assures a full hearing before the court or other
tribunal empowered to perform the judicial function

involved. That includes the right to introduce evidence 28
and have judicial findings based upon it.2"
5. Although not suggested by appellees, it is here
urged that the lower court was without power to consider the question whether the order is confiscatory.
Grounds taken are that appellants did not seasonably
raise that issue or present their evidence upon it to the
commission, and that in respect of divisions, as distinguished from the joint rates to be divided, confiscation
can never be the ultimate issue.
But ,ieither group of carriers claimed before the commissior or here asserts that the joint rates are not sufficient to permit nonconfiscatory divisions that are just,
reasonabl-I and equitable within the meaning of § 15 (6).
By fafiire to suggest the contrary, they virtually concede t.. in adequate for all purposes. The order prohibits the application of any other divisions and, unless
enjoined, must be given effect according to its terms. It
directs adjustment on the prescribed basis on shipments
made after November 22, 1930. 144 I. C. C. 603. If
that part of the order is carried into effect, the amounts
to be paid under it by the northern lines to the southern
lines will exceed, as asserted by appellants, $1,200,000.

And the application of the prescribed basis to future
shipments will correspondingly reduce northern lines'
compensation.
They could not foresee that confiscatory restitution
would be required or that confiscatory divisions would be
prescribed; they were not bound, in advance of the commission's findings and report, to set up a fear of transgression of their constitutional rights. Presumably the
commission would keep within the law. The boundaries
of the power conferred upon it by § 15 (6) had been
clearly defined. Expounding that provision, we had
held: "It is settled that in determining what the divisions
should be, the Commission may, in the public interest,
take into consideration the financial needs of a weaker
road; and that it may be given a division larger than
justice merely as between the parties would suggest 'in
order to maintain it in effective operation as part of an
adequate transportation system,' provided the share left
to its connections is 'adequate to avoid a confis,,acory
result.' " " The limitation noted in that stat .'nent
merely applies the principle that "there is no place in
our constitutional system for the exercise of arbitrary
power." 31
Appellees do not claim that appellants were required
to or could have raised the question of confiscation upon
the proposed report of the examiners. That report is not
a part of the record. At the trial appellants offered it
in evidence. The commission objected to it on the
ground that it is "a mere recommendation of an employee of the commission to the commission." The court
sustained the objection. The report of the commission

does not disclose the examiners' recommendations but
states that its conclusions differ somewhat from those
proposed by the examiners. For the reason given in the
commission's objection, upon which the court excluded
what the examiners proposed to the commission, the
appellants would not have been justified in raising the
question of confiscation upon the proposed report.
No Act of Congress requires carriers, in advance of
suit to set asitde divisions or other orders, to petition the
commission for rehearing, repeal or modification. Nor
has Congress attempted to limit the time within which
the carrier may sue to enjoin enforcement of an order
of the commission prescribing rates or divisions. That
is so for the reason, among others, that divisions valid
when made may later become confiscatory. 2 For example, the evidence as to the cost of service introduced
before the commission and at the trial was based on
operations in 1929. The appellants were not given and
could not obtain a hearing before the commission upon
the question of confiscation. Their failure earlier to invoke constitutional protection does not bar this suit.
That they diligently sought relief from the commission
is shown in the latter's brief here in which, justifying or
explaining its denial of the second petition for rehearing,
it says: "When the Commission denied the second petition, it already had before it and had considered the
proffered evidence in support of the claim of confiscation
that appellants desired it to consider, as well as the entire
record of the previous hearings, much of the testimony
*in which consisted of cost calculations and other statistical data offered by the appellants." Appellants conformed to practice appropriate and desirable as indicated

in ManufacturersRy. Co. v. United States, 246 U. S. 457,
489, and recently expounded in St. Joseph Stock Yards
Co. v. United States, ante, p. 38.
Appellants appropriately invoked judicial power to obtain constitutional protection against the commission's
order. The district court rightly held them entitled to
introduce evidence in addition to that contained in the
record before the commission, and rightly proceeded,
upon consideration of all the evidence, to make findings
and, upon the basis of the facts that it found, to decide
upon the constitutional question.
6. As to proof of confiscation.
By this appeal we are required to analyze findings of
the commission and of the court, in so far as they bear
upon the question of confiscation, and to the extent that
may be found necessary, to review the evidence and to
decide whether appellants have proved, with the degree
of certainty required in cases such as this, that the enforcement of the commission's order will operate to deprive them of their property without due process of law
or to take its use for the service of the public without
just compensation in contravention of the Fifth Amendment."
The commission having refused to consider the question of confiscation, we are deprived of the benefits of its
analysis of the evidence, findings of fact and inferences
based upon them that necessarily would have been involved in its determination of the question whether the
prescribed divisions are, and for a reasonable time in the

Opinion of the Court.

immediate future will be, sufficient to constitute just
compensation, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, for the services covered by the divisions.
To warrant reversal in so far as the order directs adjustment and refund, it must clearly appear from the
evidence before us that its enforcement, in respect of the
period involved, would leave appellants less than enough
to cover operating expense6, taxes and just compensation
for the use of their property fairly attributable to :the
service covered by the divisions. To warrant reversal of

the decree in other respects, the evidence must show that
the prescribed divisions were and in the future will be
confiscatory.

Appellees' suggestion that the challenged report and
order come to this court upon concurrent findings of the
commission and district court is without force. Denial
without more of the second petition for rehearing involved no finding of fact. It was merely a refusal to pass
upon the question of confiscation then for the first time
presented. And, as the commission in prescribing divisions acted legislatively and not judicially, the rule that
where two courts have reached the same conclusion on
a question of fact it will be accepted here unless clearly
erroneous, does not apply.
Appellants' method of calculation.-For each carrier
figure system costs per car mile thus: Ascertain from its
reports to the commission operating expenses and taxes;
apportion total between freight and passenger according
to formula prescribed by the commission; from freight
expense deduct cost of car repairs, depreciation and retirements; divide remainder by total freight car miles
and to the quotient add two cents per mile paid for use
and maintenance of refrigerator cars used to haul citrus
fruit. The result is taken to represent the cost per car
mile of transportation of that freight. It depends upon
the assumption that citrus fruit car mile cost is at least
as high as the average of system car mile cost.

374

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

298 U. S.

To ascertain property value apportionable to the service covered by the prescribed divisions: Divide investmerit in road and equipment as reported to commission
on the basis of freight operating expenses--less cost of
repair, depreciation and retirement of freight cars-to
total operating expenses, and take such proportion of
value so assigned to freight as citrus fruit car miles are
to total freight car miles. Citrus fruit net revenues
divided by value assigned, to that traffic gives rate of
return.
The shipping season of 1928-29 was the test period.
There were hauled 17,324 carloads by the Atlantic Coast
Line and Seaboard Air Line from Florida points to Richmond, Virginia; and by the Richmond, Fredericksburg
& Potomac to Potomac Yards; whence the Pennsylvania
hauled the larger part, and the Baltimore & Ohio the
rest, to destinations. Comparison of expenses determined by application of the estimated citrus fruit car
mile cost with revenues calculated on the basis of the
challenged divisions follows:

In the same season 4,662 carloads of citrus fruit from
Florida were hauled by southern carriers to other gateways named in the order and by northern lines thence
to destinations in central territory. Calculations on the
same basis indicate revenues $285,064.02, estimated expenses $232,456.87, surplus $52,607.15. Appellants say
of this surplus $39,644.92 is accounted for by 1,253 cars,
hauled a short distance b& northern carriers, affected
by minimum provisions of the order, and that the cost
assigned to them is understated.
Comparisons of divisions.-Divisions of revenues from
29,221 cars hauled to destination in Trunk Line and New

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

Opinion of the Court.

England Territory, as settled, amounted to about
$285,000 less than if made on mileage prorate. Divisions
on basis prescribed by the order would have been about
$600,000 less than if made on mileage prorate. The
prescribed divisions on shipments to New York and
Philadelphia are more than 94 per cent. of local rates
from the south to Richmond and are less than 35. per
cent. of local rates north from Richmond. Southern
weighted average hauls calculated on short line distances
were 810 miles and the northern 358 miles. Contrary to
the established general rule, the order prescribes higher
divisions per mile for the longer than for the shorter
haul. The average earning per loaded car mile south was
31.40 and north 24.
Appellants claim that the cost per citrus fruit car
mile is greater than the average of all. To support that
contention they emphasize evidence introduced to support these facts: Refrigerator cars used are very much
heavier than the cars used to haul dead freight; additional inspection service is required, hauling over road
and handling in terminals is more expeditious than that
given to ordinary cars. Thcre are required at destination
relatively very expensive produce terminals. Diversions
and reconsignments are more frequent. Expedited service requires, at intermediate and final terminals, more
employees for inspection, repairing, and keeping recOrds than otherwise would be necessary, extra engines
and crews are required promptly to classify, to switch
to ice houses, to effect reconsignments, to make up trains
and to haul them. The relatively high percentage of
empty car movement makes it hard to balance moveinent int both directions and frequently requires operation of locomotives over the road without cars.
Appellants cite a statement in the report of the commission to the effect that in general the evidence indicates that citrus fruit like other perishable traffic is

given a specialized, expedited service which is undoubtedly more expensive than the ordinary run of freight.
They refer to the testimony of experts, who expressed
opinion to the effect that the cost of transporting citrus
fruit was greater than the average cost of handling all
freight, to evidence tending to show that physical conditions, such as bridges, grades, tunnels, complex terminals,
affecting operating conditions on those portions of northern lines used for the transportation of relatively large
amdunts of citrus fruit, are more adverse than on their
respective systems as a whole.
They draw comparisons indicating 10.56 cents to be
the Baltimore & Ohio system average cost per car mile
as against 14.61 cents on the operating division over part
of which most Qf its citrus fruit is hauled; correspondingly 10.95 cents appears to be the Pennsylvania system
average as against 11.59 cents for its Eastern Region and
New York Zone over a part of which most of its citrus
fruit is hauled. 4 Basing the statement on mere opinion
of an expert, they say that on hauls over the Pennsylvania line through Baltimore and Philadelphia to New
York the transportation expense alone was 14.2 cents per
car mile.
They claim that tested by the car mile study the prescribed divisions failed by substantial margins to afford
any return to the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac
or to the Pennsylvania, and that they afforded a return
to the Baltimore & Ohio of only 4.42 per cent.
Appellants maintain that the principles underlying
their estimates of cost are sound and that the assumptions

made are reasonable. Conceding that they have not
proved what the exact cost per car mile chargeable to
citrus fruit was in the test period, or has been since, or
what it will be in the future, they refer to decisions of the
commission " and of this court "6recognizing the impossibility of making exact proof of cost of transportation of
any commodity and indicating that sometimes resort
must be had to system average costs. They emphasize
the fact that railway cost accounting cannot with exactness apportion to one commodity its fair proportion of
cost incurred in common with transportation of other
freight or of passengers; insist that special cost studies in
this case would have been impracticable; urge that they
should not be held to impracticable exactness, and that
reasonable determinations are sufficient."
Appellees call attention to the commission's rejection
of the average unit costs as a method of approximating
cost of handling a single commodity. 8 They seek to
discredit appellants' method by showing it would prove
confiscatory the divisions that for a long time they had
accepted. Their evidence tends to show: Much of the
operating expenses chargeable to maintenance of way,

number of units of service the less the cost per unit;
the very large volume of citrus fruit hauled by the Pennsylvania from Potomac Yards makes for low cost per. car
mile. Terminal services are not affected by length of
haul. The Pennsylvania citrus fruit average haul, loaded
and empty, being much greater than the system average
haul, apportionment on a car mile basis makes for excessive assignment of terminal operating expenses to
citrus fruit. And they rightly say that opinions of experts unsupported by adequate actual tests may not
safely be substituted for concrete data."
The burden on appellants, heavy though it is, does not
require them to prove with arithmetical accuracy the cost
of the transportation covered by the challenged divisions or the value of the property used to perform it, or
the proportion attributable to that service. It is enough,
if the evidence preponderating in their favor reasonably warrants findings sufficient to support the decree
sought. Many issues as to which demonstrable accuracy
is impossible have to be decided by the courts. In
ascertaining cost of transportation of one out of many
commodities hauled by railroads it is impossible to attain
precision. Mere lack of it is not ground for objection
either to the evidence offered or the facts which it tends to
prove."
We may say at once that no substantial weight is to
be given to appellants' comparison of divisions prescribed
for northern carriers with those given the southern lines.
As shown above, the commission acting under § 15 (6)
was dealing merely with fairness of divisions of a joint

Opinion of the Court.

rate and not with just compensation within the meaning
of the Fifth Amendment.
The commission's statement to the effect that citrus
fruit transportation service "is undoubtedly more expensive than the ordinary run of freight" is not entitled to
any weight, for it does not appear that the statement
referred to cost per car mile. For aught that appears,
some other unit may have been meant. And, as they
lack disclosed definite bases of established fact, no weight
may be given to cited opinions of appellants' expert
witnesses to the effect that citrus fruit car mile cost is
higher than system average.
Nor is there any force in appellees' suggestion to the
effect that the evidence on which appellants seek to prove
the prescribed divisions confiscatory would similarly condemn divisions that they accepted for a long time prior
to the reduction of the joint rates November 9, 1928. As
shown above, carriers advantageously to themselves and
the public may and sometimes do apply rates and divisions that are lower than they could be compelled by
law to accept.
The test period 1928-29 ended more than: one year
before the first complaint to the commission, four years
before its final decision and the commencement of this
suit, five years before entry of the decree appealed from,
and six years before submission to this court. In that
period there intervened a profound business depression
out of which there has been some progress.'
The evidence fails to show that the relation of citrus fruit car
mile cost to the system average has remained the same
as appellants claim it was in the test period. Appellants
should have brought forward evidence and estimates
based on operations subsequent to the complaint, No"1Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 2S4 U. S. 248,

vember 22, 1930, and also as near as possible to the time
of trial in the district court. The order prescribing the
challenged division has been in effect for a long time, and
in the absence of proof clearly showing that on the basis
of present and prospective conditions it is confiscatory,
its enforcement ought not to be enjoined.
Appellants' evidence was addressed primarily to the
question whether as to citrus fruit traffic moving through
the Richmond gateway the prescribed divisions were
confiscatory. In determining whether as to any carrier
that evidence was sufficient, appellants' estimated citrus
fruit car mile cost is of prime importance. A slight variation in that figure is sufficient to change the balance
from one side of the account to the other; to change surplus revenue to deficit. If since the order took effect that
cost has been, or in the immediate future will be, substantially less than the contemporaneous system car mile
cost, appellants' proof is not sufficient to show confiscation. It is very difficult to attain the high degree of certainty in respect of this vital factor that is obviously
necessary to make dependable proof.
Operating expenses are incurred in innumerable services few of which, if any, are the same in respect of car
mile cost as is the transportation of citrus fruit here in
question. There are many elements that affect system
average that have no relation to citrus fruit car mile costs.
It would seem that, without specific knowledge of details
of operation affecting cost during representative periods,
no dependable opinion could be reached as to the cost
relationship on which the appellants' case depends.
The facts that they brought forward to show that
citrus fruit car mile cost is at least as high as the system
average undoubtedly tend in a general way to aid that
contention. But they lack useful certainty. Appellees'
criticisms above referred to are substantial and at least
sufficient reasonably to warn against acceptance of ap-

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.

pellants' claim. A very small part of the Pennsylvania
system mileage is used to haul substantial quantities of
Florida citrus fruit. The principal volume moves over
the lines north from Potomac Yards. Ordinarily, density
of such traffic would make for lower car mile cost. Appellants claim that there it is relatively high, but the
evidence fails adequately to support that contention.
Appellants' failure to introduce evidence based on observations or tests made contemporaneously with transportation, in representative periods subsequent to the taking
effect of the order and near to the time of trial, strongly
suggests that the figures on which appellants' calculations are based could not be supported and leaves in
grave doubt the validity of their proof.
We conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to establish with requisite certainty what has been or will be
the cost of the service covered by the prescribed divisions
and that the district court rightly dismissed the suit.

MR. JUSTIcE

I agree that the suit is without merit and that the District Court was right in dismissing the bill. Two objections to the order of the Commission, unsubstantial but
otherwise proper subjects for judicial review, were disposed of briefly below and have rightly received like
treatment here. It is the third objection-the claim of
"confiscation" to which the attention of both courts has
been directed. That claim imposed upon the lower court
six days of hearings. It imposed upon this Court a reargument and a huge record. With the briefs, it weighs
avoirdupois 67 pounds. The narrative statement of the
testimony occupies 1237 pages of the printed record in
this Court; the briefs fill 546 pages. There are, besides,
428 exhibits. In my opinion, the applicable rules of procedure forbade the lower court from passing upon the

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
BRANDEIS, J.,

298 U. S.

question of "confiscation" in this suit. If "confiscation"
is threatened, there is ample remedy; but the redress
must be sought in a different proceeding.
First. The question on which I differ from the Court
is this: Where, in a suit to set aside a divisions-order,
under the Urgent Deficiency Act of October 22, 1913,
c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 216, the court concludes that there
was, in entering the order, no error of law or of fact and
no irregularity of procedure or abuse of discretion, may
it proceed to enquire into a charge, not seasonably made
before the Commission, that the divisions-order would
result in "confiscation" when applied to the through rates
prescribed by a rate-order then in force, which rate-order
had been acquiesced in by all participating carriers and
was not then under review? In my opinion, the answer
should be "No." For, if the charged "confiscation" is due
to the alleged inadequacy of the prescribed through rates,
the appropriate remedy is to apply to the Commission
to revise the rate-order. If the charged "confiscation"
is due to alleged failure of the Commission to allot to
the complaining carriers their fair share of an adequate
through rate, they are barred from complaining in this
suit, because they failed seasonably to raise, before the
Commission, that issue and present there the evidence in
support thereof. They could of course apply to the Commission to modify the order so as to make it just for the
future.
While the Commission may, at any time, modify or
supersede an order, no court has power to set an order
aside except for inherent error or procedural irregularity.
To hold that this divisions-order may be set aside because "confiscation" will result if it is applied in connection with the rate-order not under review, and not objected to, would make of that claim a paramount and
prerogative right hitherto unknown to the law.
Second. The treatment of the suit as a "confiscation
case" has led to serious misconceptions. The term "con-

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

fiscation" is appropriately used only in a proceeding for
the fixing of rates, where the objection is made that the
Commission, in prescribing rates, made them so low that
they are not compensatory; and that the Government is
thereby taking private property for the public without
paying compensation. The order under review is not a
rate-order. It is an order under § 15 (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act which fixes, as between the carriers
participating in existing through rates, "just, reasonable,
and equitable divisions," but leaves the through rate
undisturbed. Ordinarily, divisions of through rates are
governed by agreement between the carriers. It is only
where they fail to agree that an application is made
under that section.
In a proceeding 'to fix "just, reasonable, and equitable
divisions," "confiscation" can never be an ultimate issue.
For, as a matter of substantive law, the fact that the
share allotted to one is not compensatory is without legal
significance. The Commission's task is solely to make
a fair division of existing rates. A division, although
fair, may conceivably fail to give any of the connecting
carriers adequate compensation for the service rendered,
because the through rate-the thing to be divided-is
itself inadequate. Or conceivably, the through rate may
be so generous that all participants will receive compensatory divisions, although, as between themselves, the
division itself is unfair. The fact that the share assigned
to one is non-compensatory will be of evidential value
if accompanied by evidence that some other carrier is
receiving better treatment. But, unless it appears that
some other carrier was so favored, the non-compensatory
character of the division would be entirely immaterial.
And even when relevant, may be of little or no weight
because of other considerations.
At best, the non-compensatory character of the share,
if proved, would be only one of the many subsidiary

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
BRANDEIS, J., concurring.

298 U. S.

evidential facts whidh Congress, by § 15 (6), has commanded the Commission to take into consideration in
determining what a fair division is. These are "among
other things":
"the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated, the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their
railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, and the importance to the public of the transportation services of such carriers; and also whether any
particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line, and any other fact or circumstance which would ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, entitle one carrier to a greater or less proportion
than another carrier of the joint rate, fare or charge."
Thus, a division may be "just, reasonable and equitable," although it allots to one carrier a non-compensatory share and to another carrier a compensatory share,
because it was inefficiency in operation by the former
which rendered its share non-compensatory. Or, the
seemingly preferential treatment of the latter might be
justified by the fact that it was the originating carrier,
and hence entitled by established transportation practice
o the larger share of the through rate.
If inadequacy of a prescribed through rate is the reason
why the share of one of the participating carriers is noncompensatory it has ample remedies under the Interstate
Commerce Act and the Constitution. It may, at any
time, apply to the Commission for an increase of the
through rate; and if the increase i4 improperly denied, a
remedy is available in the courts by a "confiscation" suit.
That remedy would be open although the prescribed rate
had been acquiesced in; for every rate order is subject to
revision at any time upon application to the Commission.
A divisions-order, likewise, is always subject to revision;

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

but change in the through rate would not necessarily
render the existing divisions unfair.
Third. The through rates which the Conimission was
requested to divide in the proceeding under review are
those on citrus fruit from Florida to points north of the
Potomac and Ohio Rivers. These had been prescribed
by order entered July 10, 1928, Railroad Commissioners
of Florida v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 144 I. C. C.
603; and the level of rates thereby prescribed was acquiesced in. That order did not deal with divisions. The
divisions governing the Florida citrus fruit traffic had,
for many years prior to July 10, 1928, been fixed by
agreement. After entry of that order (which reduced the
through rates on the average about 67 cents a ton),
there developed a controversy as to the divisions. Being
unable to agree, all the carriers-the southern lines by
original complaint, the northern lines by cross-complaint-applied to the Commission, under § 15 (6)
of the Interstate Commerce Act, and asked it to fix the
"just, reasonable, and equitable divisions." By order
entered July 3, 1933, the Commission did so, Atlantic
Coast Line R. Co. v. Arcade & Attica R. Co., 194 I. C. C.
729. It is that divisions-order which it is sought to have
set aside with a view to having the share of the northern
carriers increased at the expense of the southern. Two
alleged errors of law charged to the Commission were
quickly disposed of by the Court as being unsubstantial.
Did it commit any error of law or of fact; or was it guilty
of an abuse of discretion in respect to the claim of "confiscation"?
The proceedings which resulted in the entry of the
divisions order, and the efforts to have it set aside, were
.as follows:
(a) The southern lines filed their complaint with the
Commission on November 22, 1930. The cross-complaint

of the northern lines followed on April 20, 1931. Hearings began on May 11, 1931, and continued for more than
seven months. Briefs were filed before the examiners.
When their proposed report was submitted to the parties,
both sides filed exceptions. In the proceedings before
the examiners there was no claim by the northern lines
that the divisions sought by the southern lines would be
confiscatory. The examiners' proposed report did not
mention that subject; and there was no claim made that
divisions recommended by them would be confiscatory.
The case was argued orally before the full Commission
on the exceptions to the examiners' report, and extensive
briefs were submitted. There was no claim or suggestion
before the Commission that the division sought or proposed would be confiscatory. On July 3, 1933, the Commission entered the order for the divisions which it found
to be "just, reasonable, and equitable." There was no
reference to the subject of confiscation in the accompanying report which occupies 34 pages. Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co. v. Arcade & Attica R. Co., 194 I. C. C. 729-762.
(b) The northern lines presented a petition requesting
that the hearing be reopened for reconsideration on the
evidence already introduced and supplemental data
culled from statistical reports in the Commission's files,
which it was agreed should be treated as evidence. On
October 9, 1933, the proceedings were reopened as requested to reconsider, upon the evidence originally submitted and that then added, whether there had been an
error of judgment in fixing the divisions. There was no
claim made in this petition for a rehearing that the divisions which had been prescribed by the order of July 3,
1933, were confiscatory. The Commission discussed in a
supplemental report of 13 pages the errors assigned; concluded that the objections were unfounded; and on January 8, 1934, affirmed the divisions prescribed. There
was no reference in the supplemental report to the subject of confiscation. 198 I. C. C. 375-387.

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

(c) On April 27, 1934, the northern carriers presented
a second petition for a rehearing; and with it presented,
as additional evidence, "cost studies." There was no suggestion that these were, in a legal sense, newly discovered
evidence; nor was there a contention that they were evidence of a change in economic or traffic conditions which
required that the Commission's conclusion should be
changed. The main claim was, as in the first petition for
rehearing, that the Commission erred in its judgment.
But the second petition contained a claim that the divisions awarded to the northern lines were confiscatory. On
May 14, 1934, this second petition was denied without
opinion.
(d) On May 25, 1934, the northern carriers brought
this suit in the federal court for Eastern Virginia to set
aside the order of July 3, 1933. The bill sought relief on
five grounds. Prominent among them was the claim that
this division was confiscatory. At the hearing before the
three judges, which began on September 17, 1934, and
occupied six days, the plaintiffs introduced in evidence a
transcript of the evidence before the Commission on
which the order complained of had been entered and confirmed, consisting of 2,054 pages of oral testimony and
358 exhibits. Over objections of the defendants the
plaintiffs were permitted to introduce additional oral evidence, of which the transcript fills 1,066 pages; also, 70
exhibits. On December 31, 1934, the court entered a final
decree dismissing the bill. Its unanimous opinion disposes briefly of the objections other than confiscation.
To that subject nearly all of the 18-page opinion is devoted. 9 F. Supp. 181-199.
(e) The application for appeal to this Court was filed
February 26, 1935. Of the grounds for relief set forth in
the bill, only three were insisted on at the original argument, namely: (1) That the Commission subordinated
all matters which under § 15 (6) it was required to take

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

298 U. S.

into consideration to the single element of the southern
lines' supposed financial needs. (2) That, while purporting to give "due consideration" to a "fair return" on the
railway property of the southern lines, the Commission
"considered only the rates of return of said Southern lines
from the entire operations of such lines instead of a fair
return on Southern lines' property fairly attributable to
the service of transporting citrus fruit"; (3) That the
divisions allowed are confiscatory. On the reargument,
confiscation was the only subject discussed; and the
opinion of the Court deals mainly with it.
Fourth. Clearly, the Commission did not err either in
a ruling of law or a finding of fact as to "confiscation" ;since it made no ruling or finding on that subject. Was
it gililty of an abuse of discretion in refusing to pass
upon it? Congress conferred upon the Commission
power to grant or deny, in its discretion, a petition for
rehearing of a decision. Interstate Commerce Act, § 16a..
It may be granted after entry of an order or before; and
the case may be reopened to admit additional evidence.
The "cost studies" submitted with the second petition
for rehearing were not, in a legal sense, newly discovered
evidence. There was a belated offering of evidence in
support of a belated contention. The purpose was to
introduce, at that late day, more evidence bearing upon
the question of what would be fair.
The refusal to grant the second petition for a rehearing was not an abuse of discretion. Federal appellate
courts will not in civil cases, upon review of the judgment
of the trial court, consider any objection not seasonably
presented below; and an objection first presented in a
petition for rehearing which has been denied is not seasonably presented unless in connection with the denial
that objection was specifically passed upon. This rule is
of general application. It governs the appellate court's
action whether the objection raises a constitutional ques-

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

tion, or relates to a matter of lesser dignity. No reason
has been suggested why that rule should not apply
equally to a judicial review by the district courts, and
this Court, of the action of the Commission. And no
case has been found in which the applicability of the rule
to a case like the present has been questioned.
The case at bar is not like Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. v.
United States, 284 U. S. 248, where the order was set
aside because the Commission refused to reopen the case
and hear additional evidence. That offered was of
changed conditions; important, because every rate-order
is subject to revision upon changes in conditions, and
the change which had occurred since the hearings was
catastrophic. To refuse to reopen the hearing under
those circumstances was held to be an abuse of discretion. In the case at bar no controlling change of condition was alleged. There was not even a claim of newly
discovered evidence. The Atchison case rests upon its
exceptional facts. It is apparently the only instance
in which this Court has interfered with the exercise of
the Commission's discretion in granting, or refusing, to
reopen a hearing. Compare United States v. Northern
PacificRy., 288 U. S. 490, 492 et seq.; Illinois Comm'n v.
United States, 292 U. S. 474, 480-481; St. Joseph Stock
Yards Co. v. United States, ante, p. 38.

Fifth. Thus, the divisions-order is free of inherent
error. Paragraph 4 of § 1 imposes upon the Commission
the duty of establishing "just, reasonable and equitable
divisions" [of through rates] "which shall not unduly
prefer or prejudice any of such participating carriers."
As the Court says, the purpose of Congress is "to empower and require the Commission to make divisions that
colloquially may be said to be fair." It adds:
"When made in accordance with the Act, the commission's orders prescribing divisions are the equivalent of Acts
of Congress requiring the carriers to serve for the amounts

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
BRANDEIS. J.,

298 U. S.

specified. Taken, as they must be, in connection with the
duties to the public imposed by law upon the carriers, they
command service and for that purpose expropriate the use
of carriers' property. If when made the prescribed divisions are or later shall become less than just compensation,
the carriers may not be required to serve therefor. And, if
after appropriate effort they fail to obtain divisions that
do constitute just compensation for their services including the use of their properties, the carriers may by suit in
equity have the order prescribing, or requiring to be kept
in force, the challenged divisions adjudged void and its
enforcement permanently enjoined."
That additional statement is, in my opinion, without
support in any act of Congress. No law gives to a
divisions-order any greater, or other, effect than that
expressed in its words. The divisions-order, which alone
is here under review, contains no command that the
"carriers serve for the amounts specified." Nor does it
"command service" at all. It merely directs
"that said complainants, cross-complainants, defendants
and respondents, according as they participate in the
transportation be, and they are hereby notified and required to cease and desist, on and after November 1,
1933, and thereafter to abstain from asking, demanding,
collecting or receiving, divisions of said joint rates upon
other bases than those prescribed."
The only command to serve is contained in the rateorder not here under review.
The Court states further: "Prescribing of divisions is
a legislative function." It would be more accurate to
say that the task imposed by § 15 (6) is a judicial, or
quasi-judicial function, incident to the legislative process
of rate-regulation. Despite the doctrine of the separation of powers, the Commission, like other governmental
bodies, exercises certain administrative and judicial, as
well as legislative functions. Many of its administrative
or judicial orders may affect the earnings and net-income

B. & 0. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
349

BRANDEIS,

J., concurring.

of the carriers, and thus affect indirectly the adequacy
of existing rates; but they are, in no sense, rate-orders.
Prominent among determinations judicial in their nature are those under § 3, whether allowances made to
one shipper for the use of his facilities, or for services,
are, as between him and competing shippers, fair, or
whether they constitute preferential treatment; determinations under Paragraph 15 of § 1, of the fair amount
payable by one carrier to another for the use of terminals
or equipment or for services rendered; determinations
under Paragraph 12 of § 1, whether distribution made of
coal cars among shippers is just and reasonable; determinations under the Valuation Act of March 1, 1913, c.
92, 37 Stat. 701, of the fair value of railroad properties.
Among the administrative functions is that of determining under the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection
Acts what changes in equipment are required in order to
insure safety; under Paragraphs 4 and 9 of § 1, what
additional facilities and equipment are required to ensure
adequate transportation service; under Paragraphs 2 to
10 of § 20a, whether a carrier should be permitted to issue
securities or assume financial obligations, and if so, on
what terms; under Paragraphs 18 to 22 of § 1, whether a
carrier should be permitted to construct, acquire or control
an additional line, or to abandon the whole, or any part
of, one existing.
In such judicial or administrative determinations it
might conceivably be contended that expenditures
ordered would so reduce net-earnings as to render noncompensatory some existing prescribed rates. But the
contention would not convert the proceeding into a ratecase. If the claim that by reason of the expenditure
ordered, prescribed rates would cease to be compensatory
proved to be well-founded, the appropriate remedy
would be to seek a modification of the rate-order which
had thus become confiscatory, not to set aside the ad-

298 U. S.

ministrative or judicial order which inherently was, and
remained, free of error.
Sixth. The question discussed is not one of merely procedural importance. To permit enquiry into the question of confiscation under the procedure here pursued
might affect seriously the substantive rights of other participating carriers. As the divisions-order merely allots
the share of each in existing rates, any addition to the
share given to one must necessarily be taken from the
share of others. For aught that appears, the share of
the southern carriers received, or insisted upon, is no
more than a compensatory return. If the Court had in
this case concluded that the share allotted to the northern
carriers was non-compensatory, and pursuant to its action their share were increased, the result might be to
make the share of the southern carriers non-compensatory.
In passing upon the issue of confiscation the Court discussed the question, whether the trial court properly admitted evidence which had not been introduced before
the Commission; and decided that the evidence was admissible. I do not agree with the Court's conclusion on
that subject. But as the issue of "confiscation" was, in
my opinion, not properly before the trial court, I refrain
from discussing the question what evidence would have
been admissible if that issue had been. See Crowell v.
