No. 857.

Jurisdictional statement distributed March 28, 1936.Decided April 13, 1936.

A convict in a Virginia penitentiary who kills an officer or guard

the Virginia Code of 1930, as construed by the Virginia courts, if
the killing was done in self-defense.

APPEAL from a judgment sustaining a verdict and sentence for felonious homicide.
Mr. S. H. Bond for appellant.
Mr. Abram P. Staples, Attorney General of Virginia,
for appellee.
PER CURIAM.

Appellant, a convict, was convicted of the felonious
killing of one Alton Leonard, a prison guard, in whose
custody appellant was working. The jury fixed his
punishment at death. The conviction and sentence were
pursuant to §§ 5049 and 5051 of the Virginia Code, 1930,
providing, so far as pertinent, as follows:
"§ 5049. A convict confined in the penitentiary, or
in custody of an officer, shall be deemed guilty of felony
if he kill, wound, or inflict other bodily injury upon an
officer or guard of the penitentiary;
"
"§ 5051. A convict guilty of such killing as is mentioned in section five thousand and forty-nine, or of any
act therein mentioned, from which death ensues to such
officer or guard, shall be punished with death."
Appellant challenged these provisions as being repugnant to the clue process and equal protection clauses

Opinion of the Court.

of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. His main contentions were that the statute was so
broad as to embrace excusable homicide and that, as a
convict he was deprived of the equal protection of the
laws relating to murder and manslaughter.
We take the statute as construed by the state court
and applied in the instant case. Appellant defended the
killing of Leonard upon the ground of self-defense. The
evidence in support of that defense, with all the circumstances of the case, was submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions which recognized the admissibility
of the defense under the statute. The trial court, defining with care the right of self-defense, charged the
jury that if appellant had acted in the exercise of that
right, the jury should find him not guilty. The Supreme
Court of Appeals refused to review the judgment upon
the ground that it was "plainly right."'
As we find no substantial federal question presented,
the appeal is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction. (1)
