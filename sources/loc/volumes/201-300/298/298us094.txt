OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Argument for Petitioner.

298 U.S.

The doctrine of stare decisis, however appropriate and
even necessary at times, has only a limited application in
the field of constitutiorial law. See the cases collected by
Brandeis, J., dissenting, in Burnet v. CoronadoOil & Gas
Co., 285 U. S. 393, 407, 408. If the challenged doctrine
is to be reconsidered, we are unwilling to approve it.

For the reasons stated by

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

the

decree should be affirmed.

TO

THE

SUPERIOR

COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA,

WESTERN DISTRICT.

No. 659.

Argucd April 6, 7, 1936.-Decided April 27, 1936.

A state court which has appointed a guardian for an incompetent
veteran has authority to order payment, out of funds belonging to
the veteran and in the hands of such guardian, of a reasonable sum
for services and expenses of an attorney, who represented the
guardian in a claim before the Veterans' Administration for reinstatement of the veteran's compensation. Executive and administrative regulations (pursuant to Acts of Congress, 48 Stat. 9;
U. S. C., Title 38, §§ 111, 114, 115) limiting the fees of attorneys
In pension matters are inapplicable and do not prevent. P. 97.

period of years, and apparently has not been questioned
in any appellate court heretofore except in Phillips v.
Ballinger,37 App. D. C. 46.
The fee being illegal, the contract therefor was invalid,
and the court could not enforce it. It is well settled law,
as stated by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Waychoff v. Waychoif, 309 Pa. 300, that a contract which is
illegal or against public policy will not be enforced.
Mr. David A. Reed for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Respondent, as guardian for her son, an incompetent
veteran, applied to the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to whose orders she was
subject (50 P. S. § 941 et seq.), for permission to pay "out
of the funds in her hands the sum of $100.00 to Hallock C.
Sherrard, Esq., for his services and expenses and making
the trip to Washington, D. C., to represent her in her
claim for her said son's estate before said Board of Veterans' Appeals." The Administration had discontinued the
veteran's compensation of $100.00 per month, upon the
ground that disability existed prior to enlistment. Request for reinstatement was set for hearing before the
Board of Veterans' Appeals at Washington, March 28,
1934. Respondent held for the estate $2,000.00, apparently pension money received from the Veterans' Administration. Mr. Sherrard had represented her since appointment and acted upon her request.
Petitioner, Frank T. Hines, appearing by counsel,
admitted rendition of the services as stated. Reasohjableness of the charge, if not inhibited by law, was not questioned. He denied the guardian's authority to contract
for the expenditure and insisted that the application for
permission to pay was not according to law. lie asked

Opinion of the Court.

that the prayer be limited to actual expenses incurred and
a fee of $2.00.
The Court of Common Pleas granted the guardian permission to pay as she had prayed; upon the Administrator's appeal, the Superior Court approved; the Supreme
Court refused further hearing.
Petitioner submits that Congress, proceeding within
its delegated power, directly, or through authorized executive action, has prescribed permissible fees for services
such as those rendered by Sherrard, and directed how
they may be paid. Also has inhibited payment of other
or different sum in any manner.
We need not consider the extent of Congressional power
in this regard, since we are of opinion that, properly
construed, the provisions relied upon do not apply where
payments like the one here involved are directed by a
state court having jurisdiction over the guardian of an
incompe'tent veteran.
The petition for certiorari asserts that the objections to
respondent's application to the Court of Common Pleas
were based upon the President's Order of March 31, 1933
(Veterans' Regulation No. 10), permitted by §§ 4 and 7
of the Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 4 Stat. 9; "Instructions" promulgated by the Administrator under authority of that Order; and §§ 111, 114 and 115, Title 38,
U. S. C.
It is true that the provisions cited place general restrictions upon the fees of attorneys in connection with pension matters and prescribe the method of payment. But
we find nothing in any of these Acts of Congress which
defiitely undertakes to put limitation upon state courts
in respcct of guardians or to permit any executive officer,
by rulc or otherwise, to disregard and set at naught orders
by courts to guardians appointed by them. Conflict in
respect of .such matters between state courts and the
federal government, its officers or baceaus would be un65773°-36---7

seemly, perhaps extremely unfortunate. And in the
absence of compelling language, we cannot conclude that
there was intention to create a situation where this probably would occur.
During many years, Congress has recognized the propriety; if not the necessity, of entrusting the custody and
management of funds belonging to incompetent pensioners to fiduciaries appointed by state courts, without seeking to limit judicial power in respect of them. To the
contrary, it has directed that whenever any guardian,
curator, or conservator fails properly to execute his trust,
etc., the Administrator may "appear in the court which
has appointed . . . and make proper presentation of such
matters." C. 723, § 2, 44 Stat. 792; c. 510, § 2, 49 Stat.
607; 38 U. S. C., § 450. Authority of the state courts
over guardians for incompetents is thus definitely recognized. The Administrator is expressly empowered to suspend further payments if the guardian is found to be
acting improperly; so much is possible without conflict.
Nothing brought to our attention would justify the view
that Congress intended to deprive state courts of their
usual authority over fiduciaries, or to sanction the promulgation of rules to that end by executive officers or
bureaus.
Tlhe broad purpose of regulations in respect of fees of
those concerned with pension matters is to protect the
United States and beneficiaries against extortion, imposition or fraud. Calhoun v. Massie, 253 U. S. 170, 173.
Dangers of this character are not to be expected in connection with the orderly exercise of authority by state
courts over appointees properly entrusted with pension
funds. The purpose in view is for consideration when
the true meaning of statute or rule is sought.
The challenged decree must be
Affirmed.
