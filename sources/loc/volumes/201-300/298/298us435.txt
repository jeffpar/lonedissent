support of this allegation was tendered in the District
Court. It is idle to discuss the right of the appellants to
make a showing in this behalf in the District Court when
in fact none was made or attempted and the court was
left, as we are, with no light on the subject save what is
afforded by the record before the Secretary and the averments of the complaint.
The decree is
Affirmed.
UNITED STATES ET AL. V. CORRICK ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 656.

Argued April 6, 1936.-Decided May 18, 1936.

1. On appeal from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction, inquiry is limited to the question whether the court
abused its discretion. P. 437.
2. A bill by operators of Market Agencies to enjoin the Secretary
of Agriculture from instituting prosecutions for violations of an
order fixing their rates under the Packers & Stockyards Act,
the ultimate purpose of the suit being to secure a decree upholding
a rate schedule posted by the plaintiffs, is not a bill to set aside
or suspend the order, within the jurisdiction of the District Court.
P. 438.
3. When the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to § 310 of the
Packers & Stockyards Act, orders specified rates thereafter to
be charged by Market Agencies, these become the only lawful rates
and so remain until the further order of the Secretary. P. 439.
4. The Secretary of Agriculture, after inquiry and full hearing,
fixed rates thereafter to be charged by the Market Agencies, and
these had not been set aside or enjoined in any appropriate judicial proceeding or been altered by subsequent order of the Secretary. Held that the District Court was without power to enjoin
the prosecution of the operators of the Agencies for charging rates
other than those set by the Secretary. P. 440.
5. Lack of jurisdiction in a federal court over the subject matter
of the litigation cannot be waived by the parties. The court
should decline to proceed with the cause. P. 440.

6. If the record discloses that the lower court was without jurisdiction, this Court will notice the defect although the parties make
no contention concerning it. P. 440.
7. This Court has jurisdiction on appeal to correct the error of a
District Court in entertaining a suit over which it had no jurisdiction. Id.
Reversed.
APPEAL from an interlocutory decree of a three-judge
District Court enjoining prosecution of plaintiffs for
violation of the Packers & Stockyards Act. Cf. the last
preceding case.

Assistant Attorney General Dickinson, with whom
Solicitor General Reed and Messrs. Wendell Berge and
G. N. Dagger were on the brief, fdr appellants.
Mr. George I. Haight, with whom Messrs. John S. Boyd
and M. K. Hobbs were on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from a decres of a specially constituted district court awarding an interlocutory injunction
against the Secretary of Agriculture and others restraining them from prosecuting the appellees, operators of
market agencies at the Chicago stockyards, for violation
of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921.'
The appellees are, for the most part, the same persons
and corporations as the appellants in No. 655, Acker v.
United States, ante, p. 426. While that case was pending
on appeal to this court, and the rates therein prescribed by
order of the Secretary of Agriculture were suspended
until final determination respecting their validity, the
appellees prepared and posted, on October 19, 1935, a
schedule of rates for market services at the Chicago

stockyards to become effective November 1, 1935. These
rates were, in most instances, higher than those prescribed by the Secretary's orders of January 8 and March
12, 1934. On the same day the appellees tendered the
schedule to the Secretary for filing. He declined to receive it, assigning as. reasons for his refusal that once
rates are fixed by him no change therein may be made
except by his order or by action of a court of competent
jurisdiction and that litigation was then pending challenging the validity of his outstanding orders. Thereupon the appellees filed their bill in the, district court
reciting the course of the Secretary's proceedings referred
to in No. 655, the orders made, and the suit to restrain
their enforcement. The pleading asserts that the orders
were based on data for the years 1931 and 1932; that,
subsequently to promulgation of the orders, conditions
had so changed that to prevent destruction of their business the appellees were compelled to adopt a new schedule of charges; it recites the Secretary's refusal to file
the new schedule and alleges that the refusal was a violation of his duty under the act; it charges that his refusal was of no effect since his only power in the premises
was to file the schedule and, if he believed the rates
named therein unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory,
to suspend them, pursuant to the provisions of the act,
and, after hearing, fix reasonable and nondiscriminatory
rates. The bill alleges that the schedule of October 19,
1935, became effective November 1, 1935, and that if
appellees failed to conform thereto they would incur
heavy penalties while, on the other hand, the Secretary
was threatening to prosecute them unless they adhered
to the rates prescribed by his orders of January 8 and
March 12, 1934. After a hearing upon the bill and a
supporting affidavit the court granted an injunction.
On appeal from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction our inquiry is limited to the ques-

tion whether the court abused its discretion.2 The appellants urge that the action taken constituted such an
abuse for the reason that want of jurisdiction is evident
upon the face of the bill. With this contention we
agree.
Section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act 3 adopts
the same procedure for restraining enforcement of or
setting aside orders of the Secretary as is provided by
lew with respect to orders of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. By § 1 of the Commerce Court Act' jurisdiction was conferred upon the Commerce Court "over
all cases . . . brought to enjoin, set aside, annul,
or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission." The Urgent Deficiencies
Act of October 22, 1913,' transferred the jurisdiction of
the Commerce Court to the district courts and provided
that such cases should be heard by three judges. The
words of the statute exclude a mere refusal to act from
the section conferring jurisdiction, and this court has
accordingly held that an order negative in form and substance is not within the relief accorded.' It is clear that

Opinion of the Court.

the instant bill was not one to set aside or suspend any
order of the Secretary. The proceeding brought for
that purpose was No. 655, just decided. This suit is to
restrain the Secretary and others from instituting prosecution for violations of an order. Its ultimate purpose
is to secure a decree affirming the validity and effectiveness of the rate schedule posted by the appellees October
19, 1934. The injunction restrains the defendants' from
preventing, or attempting to prevent, or from interfering
with the appellees in the collection of the rates of charge
fixed by the schedule tendered to the Secretary October
19, 1935.
The District Court was without jurisdiction for a further reason. Section 306 of the Packers and Stockyards
Act ' directs that within sixty days after the Secretary
shall have given notice that a stockyard falls within the
definition of § 302 every market agency at such stockyard shall file with him, and keep open for inspection,
schedules of rates and charges for its services. No changes
are to be made in the rates so filed and published except
after ten days' notice to the Secretary and to the public.
Section 310 authorizes an order for investigation and a
hearing by the Secretary on complaint, or on his own
initiative, as to whether existing rates are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and empowers him, after
such hearing, to "determine and prescribe what will be
the just and reasonable rate or charge, or rates or charges,
to be thereafter observed in such case, or the maximum or
minimum, or maximum and minimum, to be charged, and
what regulation or practice is or will be just, reasonable,
and nondiscriminatory to be thereafter followed; . . .".8
Section 306 prescribes the method of initiating rates upon
the act's becoming effective, and of voluntary alteration
of them from time to time. But when the Secretary, pur7

suant to § 310, 6rders specified rates thereafter to be
charged these become the only lawful rates and so remain
until the further order of the Secretary.'
The bill shows that the Secretary, after inquiry and full
hearing, fixed rates thereafter to be charged by the appellees, and these had not been set aside or enjoined in
any appropriate judicial proceeding or been altered by
subsequent order of the Secretary. The court was, therefore, without power to enjoin the prosecution of the appellees for charging rates other than those established by
the Secretary.

The appellants did not raise the question of jurisdiction at the hearing below. But the lack of jurisdiction
Qf a federal court touching the subject matter of the
litigation cannot be waived by the parties, and the district court should, therefore, have declined sua sponte,
to proceed in the cause. 10 And if the record discloses
that the lower court was without jurisdiction this court
will notice the defect, although the parties make no
contention concerning it."' While the District Court
lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not
of the merits but merely for the purpose of correcting
the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit."
The decree must, therefore, be reversed and the cause
remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.
Reversed.
