DEAN v. DAVIS, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF
JONES, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 70.

Argued November 6, 7, 1916.-Decided January 8, 1917.

A transfer of property by an insolvent, made to secure a contemporaneous loan of money which the lender advances, and the insolvent
obtains and uses, for the discharge of a preexisting debt of the
insolvent to a third party, in which the lender has no interest, is not a
preference of the lender within § 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, as
amended February 5, 1903, 32 Stat. 797, 800.
A transfer, the intent or obviously necessary effect of which is to deprive creditors of the benefits sought to be secured by the Bankruptcy Act, "hinders, delays, or defrauds creditors" within the
meaning of § 67e.
An insolvent borrowed money of a relative and secured it by a contemporaneous mortgage of all his property, which was recorded.
The money was sought, advanced and used to satisfy one of his preexisting debts and thus cnable him to escape a criminal prosecution. Mortgagee and insolvent both knew of the insolvency, and
the circumstances were such that both must, have anticipated
the suspension of business and bankruptcy which followed the
recording of the mortgage. Held, that these facts warranted the
District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals in concluding that the
ins6lvent intended to defraud his creditors within the meaning of
§ 67e and that the mortgagee was not a purchaser or lienor in good

A decree avoiding a transfer as fraudulent will not be disturbed upon
the ground that it exceeds the pleadings where the bill, though
attacking the transfer mainly as an unlawful preference, contains
enough with the answer to present the issue of fraud, where that
issue was fully tried., and the question of variance is first raised in
this court.

Mr. Wyndham R. Meredith, with whom Mr. C. V.
Meredith was on the briefs, for appellant:
Appellees not having taken a cross appeal from the
decision of the District Court that the mortgage was not a
preference, that question was not before the Court of
Appeals for decision and it was error to decide it. Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 195; Loudon v. Taxing District,

Mere knowledge by a lender that the money borrowed is
to be applied by the insolvent to prefer a creditor does not
make the security given invalid as a preference under

The transfer was not fraudulent. An intent to prefer is
not an intent to defraud. It is not per se unlawful for an
insolvent to borrow money to use in making a preference,
and, the lender, though aware of all the facts and even if
he act as the borrower's agent in making the payment,.
Crim v. Woodford, 136 Fed. Rep. 34, commits no wrong in
lending, or in taking security. Such transactions are not
voidable under § 67e unless accompanied by actual intent
to defraud, which must be clearly proved and was absent
in this case. Institution of bankruptcy proceedings within
four months does nbt relate back and convert what was a
lawful transfer into a fraudulent conveyance. Coder v.

The Bankruptcy Act, as amended February 5, 1903,
provides in § 60b that if a debtor has within four months
before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy made a
transfer which the person receiving the same has reason to
believe was intended to give a preference, the transfer

shall be voidable, and the trustee in bankruptcy may reAcover the property or its value. The act also provides in
§ 67e (30 Stat. 564) that if a debtor within four months
before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy makes any
transfer "with the intent and purpose on his part to
hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of them," it
shall be null and void except as to purchasers in good faith
and for a present fair consideration; and that it shall be
the duty of the trustee to recover the same.
R. Crawley Jones was a farmer and owner of a country
store. A bank having discounted his notes bearing endorsements which it later concluded had been forged,
demanded that Jones take up the notes. Fearing arrest
he appealed through his father to his brother-in-law,
Dean, for a loan of $1,600, promising to secure it by a
mortgage of all his property, which he represented was
worth more than five times that amount. Dean provided
the money, and on September 3, 1909, acting in conjunction with Jones' father, "took up" the notes. Most of
them were not yet due. A mortgage deed of trust dated
September 3 was ececuted September 10, and recorded
September 11. It covered practically all of Jones' property, including the stock in trade and accounts, store
furnishings and fixtures, household furniture and goods,
live stock, crops standing and cut and the farm itself, the
last subject to a prior deed of trust. Four mortgage notes
were given, payable respectively in seven, thirty, sixty and
ninety days; with a proviso that upon default on any one
all should become payable. The first note-and hence
all-were overdue when the mortgage was recorded. On
that day Dean directed that possession of the property be
taken, which was done on September 13 (the twelfth being
Sunday). Jones was at the time deeply insolvent and had
many unsecured creditors. Some of these immediately
challenged the validity of the mortgage. Within a few
days an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed and

DEAN v. DAVIS.
242 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Jones was adjudicated a bankrupt. The mortgaged property was converted into cash under an agreement with
general creditors that it should be deposited to await the
ultimate determination of the rights of the parties. It
yielded only $1,634-leaving nothing for the general
creditors, if the mortgage is held valid.
Davis, the trustee in bankruptcy, brought a bill in
equity to set aside the mortgage. The District Court
granted the relief prayed for; and its 'decree was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both courts found the
facts to be in, substance as above stated and held the
mortgage void under § 67e as having been made by Jones
"with the intent and purpose on his part to hinder, delay,
or defraud his creditors" to one not a "purchaser in good
faith" within the meaning of the act. The Circuit Court
of Appeals held the mortgage void also as a preferonce
under § 60b. 212 Fed. Rep. 88. The case comes to this
court upon appeal; Dean contending' that the mortgage
is not invalid under either § 60b or § 67e.
The mortgage was not voidable as a preference under
§ 60b. Preference implies paying or securing a preexisting debt of the person preferred. The mortgage was
given to secure Dean for a substantially contemporary
advance. The bank, not Dean, was preferred. The use of
Dean's money to accomplish this purpose could not convert the transaction into a preferring of Dean, although he
knew of the debtor's insolvency. Mere circuity of arrangement-will not save a transfer which effects a preference from being invalid as such. National Bank of New'port v. NationalHerkimer County Bank, 225 U. S. 178, 184.
But a transfer to a third person is invalid under this section as a preference, only where that person was acting on
behalf of the creditor, as in In re Beerman, 112 Fed. Rep.
663, and Walters v. Zimmerman, 208 Fed. Rep. 62; 220
Fed. Rep. 805. Here Dean acted on the debtor's behalf
in providing the money and taking up the notes.

242 U. S.

But under § 67e the basis of invalidity is much broader.
It covers every transfer made by the bankrupt "within
four months prior to the filing of the petition, with the
intent and purpose on his part to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of them" "except as to pur-

chasers in good faith and for a present fair' consideration."
As provided in § 67d, only "liens given or accepted in
good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon
this Act" are unassailable. A transfer, the intent (or
obviously necessary effect) of which is to deprive creditors
of the benefits sought to be secured by the Bankruptcy
Act "hinders, delays or defrauds creditors" within the
meaning of §67e. Van Iderstine v. National Discount Co.,
227 U. S. 575, 582, points out the distinction between the
intent to prefer and the intent to defraud. A transaction
may be invalid both as a preference and as a fraudulent
transfer. It may be invalid only as a preference or only
as a fraudulent transfer. Making a mortgage to secure an
advance with which the insolvent debtor intends to pay a
preexisting debt does, not necessarily imply an intent to
hinder, delay or defraud creditors. The mortgage may
be made in the expectation that thereby the debtor will
extricate himself from a particular difficulty and be enabled to promote the interest of all other creditors by
continuing his business.' The lender who makes an advance for that purpose with full knowledge of the facts
may be acting in perfect "good faith." But where the
advance is made to enable the debtor to make a preferential payment with bankruptcy in contemplation, the

transaction presents an element upon which fraud may be
predicated. The fact that the money advanced is actually
used to pay a debt does not necessarily establish good
faith. It is a question of fact in each case what the intent
was with which the loan was sought and made
We cannot say that the facts found by the District
Court and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals were

not supported by the evidence, nor that these courts erred
in concluding upon this evidence that the mortgage waA:
made wth the purpose and intent to hinder, delay or
defraud Jones' creditors and that Dean was not as against
general creditors "a purchaser in good faith." Jones
knew that he was insolvent. He knew that he was making
a~preferential payment. He must have known that suspension of his business and bankruptcy would result from
giving and irecording a mortgage of all his property to
secure a note'which had matured before the mortgage was
executed. The lower courts were justified in concluding
that he intended the necessary consequences of his act;
that he willingly sacrificed his property and his other
creditors to avert a threatened criminal prosecution; and
that Dean, who, knowing the facts, cooperated in the
bankrupt's fraudulent purpose, lacked the saving good

faith.
The conclusion reached by the lower courts is supported
by many decisions of the several District Courts and
Circuit Courts of Appeals, which are referred to in the
margin.' It is in harmony with both the Van Iderstine
1 Cases holding that a mortgage is a fraudulent conveyance where

taken as security for a loan which the lender knows is to be used to
prefer favored creditors in fraud of the act: Parker v. Sherman, 212
Fed. Rep. 917 (C. C. A. 2d Circuit); In re Soforenko, 210 Fed. Rep. 562
(D. C. Mass.); Johnson v. Dismukes, 204 Fed. Rep. 382 (C. C. A. 5th
Circuit); Lumpkin v. Foley, 204 Fed. Rep. 372 (C. C. A. 5th Circuit);

v. Johnson, 151 Fed. Rep. 567 (C. C. A. 4th Circuit); In re Pease, 129
Fed. Rep. 446 (D. C. Mich.). See also Walters v. Zimmerman, s. c. on
appeal, 208 Fed. Rep. 62 (D. C. Ohio), 220 Fed. Rep. 805 (C. C. A. 6th

Circuit).

know that the insolvent borrower intended to make improper payments to favored creditors-thus indicating that the mortgage would
be fraudulent if such additional fact were shown: Grinstead v. Union

Case, and Coder v. Arts, 213 U. S. 223, 244, upon which'
appellant particularly relies. In each of these cases this
court refused to hold fraudulent in law a transfer which
the Circuit Court of Appeals had found to be innocent in
fact. In the Van Iderstine Case, where a pledge was held
valid, the Circuit Court of Appeals had expressly found
that the pledgee was without knowledge of the debtor's
fraudulent intent, if such there was. In Coder v. Arts,
where a mortgage was held valid, the Circuit Court of
Appeals had found that in making the mortgage the debtor
had no intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, and
this court said that "in view of the finding of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, it may be that [he], though including in
the conveyance a large amount of his property, acted in
good faith, with a view to preserving his estate and enabling him to meet his indebtedness." This court while
declaring itself bound by the facts so found, was careful to
express its dissent from the view "that the giving of the
mortgage and its effect upon other creditors could not be

Rep. 804 (C. C. A. 7th Circuit).
In accord with this view are also the decisions which hold that a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors, though without preferences, is void under § 67e because its necessary effect is to hinder,
delay or defraud creditors in their rights and remedies under the Bankruptcy Act. In re Gutwillig; 90 Fed. Rep. 475; 92 Fed. Rep. 337; Davis

great weight of authority aid the decisions of this court. In re Baar,

considered as an item of evidence in determining the
question of fraud."
Dean contends also that relief should n6t have been
granted under § 67e because the bill was framed under
§ 60b. The objection was not taken in the District Court,
although the question of invalidity under § 67e was
elaborately discussed on demurrer to the bill as well as
upon final hearing. Twenty-five other errors were assigned on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
This objection was not raised then. It was insisted only
that the evidence did not warrant the finding of fraudulent intent. Section 60b seems to have been mainly in
the mind of the pleader when the bill of complaint was
drafted, but not exclusively, for it alleges that the plaintiff as trustee was entitled "to recover property transferred by said bankrupt in fraud of his creditors." The
answer expressly alleges that the mortgage was accepted
"without any intent or purpose of aiding said Jones to
defraud, delay or hinder his creditors, and not in contemplation of or in fraud of the bankrupt act, or any of
its provisions, believing him to be solvent and that he
would continue his business." The issue of fraudulent
transfer was presented by the pleadings, was fully tried
and was found against the appellant. No error was committed.
Decree affirmed.
