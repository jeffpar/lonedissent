PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY v. W. F.
JACOBY & COMPANY.
ON CERTIFICATE FROM AND CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 22. Argued October 20, 1915; affirmed by divided court November 15, 1915; restored to docket for reargument December 20, 1915;
reargued October 23, 24, 1916.-Decided December 4, 1916.
In an action against a carrier to enforce an award made by the Interstate Commerce Commission for damages arising from discrimination in allotments of coal cars, plaintiffs, to prove the damage suffered, relied on the prima facie case made by the findings and orders
of the Commission; the defendant introduced a tabulated statement
of car allotments and percentages which had been introduced in
evidence before the Commission by the plaintiffs, and which, when
compared with the findings, justified most strongly, if it did not
compel, a deduction that, in fixing the damages awarded, the Commission, by misapplying percentages given in the statement, had
followed a legally erroneous method of computation and so had
arrived at a legally erroneovs result.
Held: (1) That the tabulated statement, and oral testimony comparing
it mathematically with figures stated in the findings, were competent
evidence, tending to overcome the primafacie force of the Commission's orders.
(2) That the defendant was entitled to a specific instruction to the
effect that, if the jury found such erroneous method of computation
was the one actually employed by the Commission, the award was
erroneous and the plaintiffs not entitled to recover.
(3) That, under the circumstances, the fact that the evidence before
the Commission was not all before the court would not justify a
controlling presumption that the award was properly arrived at on
competent proofs.
(4) That the error was not cured by divers general instructions Which
are stated in the opinion.
In computing damages resulting from discrimination by a carrier in
car allotments, it is error to assume that the complaining shipper
should have received cars in the same ratio to shipping requirements

as was allowed his favored competitor in the making of the discrimination.
The award should be based on the damages actually resulting from
the discrimination.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Francis I. Gowen and Mr. John G. Johnson, with
whom Mr. F. D. McKenney was on the briefs, for Pennsylvania Railroad Co.
Mr. Win. A. Glasgow, Jr., for Jacoby & Co.
MR.JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
Jacoby & Company, hereinafter called the plaintiffs,
owned a coal mine known as Falcon No. 2 in the Clearfield
District served by the Tyrone Division of the lines of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, hereinafter called the
Company, and shipped coal from their mine in interstate
commerce. In June, 1907, the plaintiffs made complaint
before the Interstate Commerce Commission of discriminatory practices against them in the distribution of coal
cars, in violation of the Act to Regulate Commerce. The
Commission made findings, among others, that Falcon
No, 2 was not placed on an equal footing with the mines
of the Berwind-White Coal Company in the matter of
the distribution of the defendant's available coal car equipment during the period of the action. It also found a
special allotment of 500 cars daily to the Berwind-White
Company to be an undue preference and discrimination,
and on March 7th, 1910, the Commission made an order,
finding that the complainants had been unduly discriminated against, and get forth that it appeared "that it is
and has been the defendant's rule, regulation and practice,
in distributing coal cars among the various coal operators
on its lines for interstate shipments during percentage

periods, to deduct the capacity in tons of foreign railway
fuel cars, private cars, and system fuel cars, in the record
herein referred to as 'assigned cars,' from the rated capacity in tons of the particular mine receiving such cars and
to regard the remainder as the rated capacity of that mine
in the distribution of all 'unassigned' cars." The Commission ordered "That the said rule, regulation and practice
of the defendant in that behalf unduly discriminates
against the complainants and other coal operators similarly
situated and is in violation of the third section of the
Act to Regulate Commerce" and "That the defendant
be, and it is hereby, notified and required, on or before the
1st day of November, 1910, to cease and desist from said
practice and to abstain from maintaining and enforcing
its present rules and regulations in that regard, and to
cease and desist from any practice and to abstain from
maintaining any rule or regulation that does not require
it to count all such assigned cars against the regular rated
capacity of the particular mine or mines receiving such
cars in the same manner and to the same extent and on
the same basis as unassigned cars are counted against the
rated capacity of the miaes receiving them."
At the same time, the Commission ordered that the
question of damages sustained by the plaintiffs in respect
to the matters and things in the report found to be discriminatory be deferred pending further argument. See
also 19 I. C. C. 392, where the decision is reported. In
that case the Commission referred to its report filed the
same day in the case of Hillsdale Coal & Coke Company v.
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 19 I. C. C. 356, in which
the discriminatory character of the rules of car distribution of the Company is fully discussed (page 364) and the
rules are condemned, largely because of the advantages
given to the owners of private cars unless the same shall
be counted against the distributive share of the mine receiving them. See also the discussion of these- rulings in

On March 11, 1912, the Commission made a further
report, in. which it found as follows:
"We find that by reason of the discriminations ascertained and set forth in our report in Jacoby v. P. R. R. Co.,
19 I. C. C. 392, the complainants were damaged to the
extent of $21,094.39, which they are entitled to recover
with interest from June 28, 1907.
"The claimants here demand $51,950.49. The award
above made we base upon evidence adduced of record
from which we find:
"(a) That the fair rating of the mine for the time in
question, as fixed by the defendant and not objected to
by the complainants, was 450 tons per day.
"(b) That during the period from April, 1904, to
March 31, 1905, the mine was operated 275 days; and
that during the second period named on the exhibits, from
April 1 to October 18, 1905, it was operated 1384 days.
"(c) That during the first of these periods 38,714.23
tons were actually shipped from Falcon No. 2, and during
the second period 17,973.88 tons; that if the complainants
had received their fair share of the cars available for distribution the mine would have made additional interstate
shipments and sales to the extent of 35,412.02 tons and
19,104.77 tons during the respective periods.
"(d) That the average selling price of the complainants' product for the first 'period was $1.212 per ton, and
in the 'second period $1.1670; that the cost of production,
based on economical operation of the mine with a fair
car supply, would have been 92 cents during the entire
period of the action; and that the profit during the first
period would therefore have been 29.2 cents and during
the second period 24.7 cents per ton. This measures the
loss on the tonnage which the complainant was unable to
ship.

PENNSYLVANIA R. R. CO. v. JACOBY & CO.

93

Opinion of the Court.

"(e) That the actual cost of production is shown by
the record as $1.016 per ton during the first period and
$1.049 per ton during the second period, making an excess
of 9.6 cents and 12.9 cents for the respective, periods in
the actual cost of production under the conditions obtaining, as compared with what would have been the cost
based on a fair car supply as heretofore stated. This is
the basis adopted for computing the loss sustained by
these complainants in diminished profits for the coal
actually shipped during the period in question."
On March 11th, 1912, the Commission made a reparation order in favor of the plaintiffs, confirming its former
orders, findings and conclusions, and ordering that the
Company should pay to the plaintiffs on or before the
first day of June, 1912, the sum of $21,094.39, with interest
thereon at the rate of six per cent. per annum from
June 28th, 1907, as reparation for defendant's discrimination in distribution of. coal cars, which discrimination hd
been found by the Commission to be unlawful and unjust.
Upon these orders of the Commission,. suit was brought
in. the District Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, on July 19th, 1912, the action
being based upon ยง 16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce,
34 Stat. 590. The case was heard in the District Court,
and resulted in a verdict for the amount awarded by the
Commission, with interest thereon. On the case going to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, that court certified certain
questions to this court, and upon writ of certiorari the
whole record was brought here.
The case was argued before this court at the October
term, 1915. At that term the judgment below was affirmed, with costs, by a divided court. Afterwards, and
at the same term, a petition for rehearing was granted
and the former judgment set aside, and the case restored
to the docket for reargument. 239 U. S. 631.
At the trial in the District Court the plaintiffs offered

no other testimony as to the amount of damages sustained
by them than that contained in the orders of the Commission, before recited. Section 16 of the Act makes the findings and orders of the Commission prima facie evidence
of the facts therein stated, and it may be conceded that
if no testimony was offered in the case to overcome the
prima facie case thus made, the orders of the Commission
would be controlling and determine the amount of recovery. The primafacie character of the findings of fact and
award of damages by the Commission was established upon
full consideration of the subject in Meeker v. Lehigh Valley
R. R. Co., 236 U. S. 412, 426-431, and second Meeker Case,
236 U. S. 434. This court said in Mills v. Lehigh Valley
Railroad Co., 238 U. S. 473, 481, after quoting from the
Meeker Cases, supra, "The statute was not concerned
with mere forms of expression and in view of the decision
that a finding of the ultimate fact of the amount of damage
is enough to give the order of the Commission effect as
prima facie evidence, we think that the court did not err
in its ruling. The statutory provision merely established
a rule of evidence. It leaves every opportunity to the
defendant to contest the claim."
In order to meet the primafacie case made by the plaintiffs upon the orders of the Commission in awarding dam-'
ages, in the course of the testimony the Company put in
evidence certain sheets, which were offered in evidence
before the Commission by the plaintiffs, in the hearing
before that body, known as Exhibit No. 10. These sheets
were entitled "Detailed statement showing discrimination
in favor of other mines and against Falcon No. 2 [the
mine of the plaintiffs] from April 1, 1904, to April 1, 1905,"
and "from April 1, 1905, to October 15, '1905," respectively, these being the periods for which recovery was
sought in this case by the plaintiffs. These sheets undertook to show the percentage of cars awarded to certain
preferred companies by the Railroad Company, as com-

Opinion of the Court.

pared to those awarded to the plaintiffs for use in their
mine during the period stated. They were intended to
show that the favored companies received cars during the
first period to the extent of 59.9% of their mine ratings,
and during the second 59.6% of their mine ratings, which
percentages were much larger than, the plaintiffs received
for their mine during the like periods. In other words, it
was thus sought to establish that the favored mines received, not their just proportion of the distributable cars,
but a much larger, and highly discriminatory, share when
compared with the allotment made to the plaintiffs. It is
the contention of the Company that it is demonstrable
from this record that these tables showing the percentages
awarded to favored companies were made the basis of the
Commission's award of damages.
, We have already seen from the orders of the Commission, above recited, the manner in which it made its award
and reached its conclusion as to the amount recoverable
by the plaintiffs. At the trial in the District Court, the
Company placed a witness upon the stand, who testified
as follows:
"Q. Referring to the order which has been put in evidence made by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
finding a certain amount as due Jacoby & Company, will
you please say whether you have taken the daily rating
fixed by the Commission as proper, namely, 450 tons per
day, and multiply that by 275 days, the days which the
Commission found the plaintiff's mine would have been
able to Work in the year ending March 31, 1905, and tell
us what the aggregate number of tons is, based upon those
two figures?
"A. 123,750 tons.
"Q. In that same order the Commission has found that
the plaintiff shipped in that period 38,714.23 tons and that
they ought to have received cars which would have enabled
them to ship 35,412.02 tons additional. If they had made

those additional shipments what would the total volume
of shipments have been?
"A. 74,126.25 tons.
"Q. What percentage of the aggregate capacity of the
mine, based upon 450 tons per day and 275 days, are the
aggregate shipments which would have been made, which
you have just spoken of?
"A. 59.9 per cent.
"Q. Coming to the second period of the action, the
Commission found that 450 tons per day was a proper
rating for the mine and that the mine would have been
capableof working 138Y4 days. What, on that basis, is
the aggregate capacity of the mine in that period?
"A. 62,212.51 tons.
"Q. In their order the Commission found that in that
period the mine had shipped 17,973.88 tons and that it
should have received cars which would have enabled it to
ship 19,104.77 tons additional. If it had made those additional shipments, what would have been the total shipments in that period?
"A. 37,078.65 tons.
"Q. And what percentage is that of the aggregate rated
capacity based on 450 tons a day and 138Y4 days?
"A. 59.6."
This testimony was competent in order to meet the
plaintiffs' case based on the orders of the Commission, and
from it we think the conclusion is-inevitable that the
Commission may have used the percentages of 59.9% and
59.6% respectively, in reaching the amount of damages
awarded to the complainant. If so, the recovery was
permitted, not upon the basis of damages sustained by.
reason of the illegal discrimination practiced against the
plaintiffs as found by the Commission, but upon the basis
that they. were entitled to receive cars equal in ratio to
those illegally and preferentially given to the certain
favored companies named in the tables. The effect of

Opinion of the Court.

the enforcement of such rule, would be, not to give the
shipper the damages which he actually suffered, but would
base the recovery, upon a rule which is condemned as to
others, because of its discrimination in their favor,-a
result manifestly not intended by the Act of Congress.
The testimony being in the condition which we have
stated, and the plaintiffs having offered no testimony to
show the amount of damages sustained other than that
contained in the order made by the Commission, the
Company made certain definite requests to charge, which
were refused. In one of them, they requested a peremptory instruction in favor of the Company upon the
ground that as the award of the Interstate Commerce
Commission was based upon the conclusion that in the
year ending April 1st, 1905, the plaintiffs should have
received cars equal in capacity to 59.9% of the aggregate
of their daily mine rating for 275 days, and in the period
between April 1st and October 18th, 1905, cars equal in
capacity to 59.6% of their daily mine rating for 1384
days, it was apparent that this conclusion of the Commission was based upon the evidence presented by the
plaintiffs that the aggregate of the cars placed by the
defendant at certain mines selected for the purpose of
comparison from those comprised in the region in which
the plaintiffs' mine was located, had been equal in the
earlier period to 59.9% and in the later period'59.6% of
the aggregate ratings of these selected mines. If the
court should refuse to charge as above requested, the
court was requested to instruct the jury as follows:
"8. If the jury should find that the conclusion of the
Interstate Commerce Commission that the plaintiffs in
the year ending April 1, 1905, should have received cars
equal in capacity to 59.9% of the aggregate of their daily
mine ratings, and in the period between April 1, and October 18, 1905, cars equal in capacity to 59.6% of the aggregate of their daily mine ratings, was reached or arrived

at because of the evidence presented by the plaintiffs that
the aggregate of the cars placed by -the defendant at
certain mines selected for the purpose of comparison from
those comprised in the region in which the plaintiffs'
mine was located .had been equal in the earlier -period to
59.9% and in the later period to'59.6% of the aggregate.
ratings of these selected mines, the basis for the Commission's conclusion and award was an erroneous one, and the
plaintiffs consequently are not entitled to recover."
In view of the testimony as we have already stated it,.
we think the Company was entitled to have this eighth
request given in charge to the jury. Nor do we think this
refusal was cured by the charge that the finding of the
Commission was primafaciecorrect, and entitled to weight
as such unless the defendant produced evidence to show
that some other state of facts existed, and that the plaintiffs had not suffered the damages awarded to them by
the Commission, and the charge in general terms that it
was the duty of the Company to apportion and deliver to
the plaintiffs their fair share of all cars available during
the period of the action to shippers in the district in which
plaintiffs' mine was located, and that if plaintiffs received
their full and proportionate share of cars in the district
they had no cause for complaint against the Company
and the burden was upon the plaintiffs to establish by
satisfactory proof that they did not receive their share;
nor by other parts of the charge in which the jury was told
in general terms that the shipper was entitled to recover
the full amount of damages which he sustained, and that
in arriving at such damages the jury could only take
into consideration whether they had been discriminated
against, and to what extent they were damaged by that
discrimination, and that, if the Berwind-White Company
got 59 per cent. of its output when the average allottable
was 28 per cent., it did not necessarily follow that the
plaintiffs would be damaged the entire difference between

PENNSYLVANIA R. R. CO. v. JACOBY & CO.

99

Opinion of the Court.

28 per cent. and 59 per cent., but their damage would be
the amount to which their number of cars was reduced
in the general allotment by favoring somebody else and
taking the cars from them. However correct these general
observations may have been, we think it was error in the
state of the record to which we have already referred to
refuse the specific charge requested.
It is urged that the testimony before the Commission
is not all in the record, and that for aught that appears
the Commission may have reached its conclusion and
awarded damages upon other and competent proofs, and
it is insisted that the coincidence of the amount as awarded
and the amount ascertained by the use of the percentages
contained in the tables may not necessarily have controlled
the action of the Commission. But it is difficult to reach
the conclusion that the Commission could have arrived
at the result so exactly corresponding with the one obtained by the use of the percentages shown in the tables,
except by actually using them to ascertain the sum which
is exactly the amount resulting from their application.
The Commission might have approximated the same
result by using other and legal means to ascertain the damages sustained, but when it is demonstrated that the use
of the percentages precisely produces the amount awarded
to the dollar and cent, it seems almost mathematically
certain that the result could have been reached in no
other way. At least, we think that the testimony was in
such shape that, as we have already said, the Company
was entitled to the specific request upon this subject
submitting the matter to the jury.
For error in refusing to give this request in the charge,
the judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and
the case remanded to that court for a new trial.
Reversed.
