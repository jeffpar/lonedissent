HERBERT v. SHANLEY CO.
242 U. S.

Argument for Petitioners in No. 427.

HERBERT ET AL. v. THE SHANLEY COMPANY.
JOHN CHURCH COMPANY v. HILLIARD HOTEL
COMPANY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
Nos. 427, 433.

Argued January 10, 1917.-Decided January 22, 1917.

The performance of a copyrighted musical composition in a restaurant
or hotel without charge for admission to hear it but as an incident of
other entertainment for which the public pays, infringes the exclusive
right of the owner of the copyright to perform the work publicly for
profit, under the Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, § 1 (e), 35 Stat. 1075.
221 Fed. Rep. 229; 229 Fed. Rep. 340, reversed.

THE cases are stated in the opinion.

were copyrighted and the name of the proprietor of both
copyrights, all rights secured by the copyright in the
entire opera, including the dramatic performing right, are
preserved with respect to the vocal number. West Publishing Co. v. Edward Thompson Co., 176 Fed. Rep. 833, 837.
The performance was an infringement of the exclusive
dramatic performing right secured by § 1 (d). The opera
is a "drama." Drone on Copyright, p. 589; The Iolanthe
Case, 15 Fed. Rep. 439, 442; Copyright Act, §§ 5 (d),
25 (b), subdiv. Fourth. The dramatic right extends to
every material part of the opera. Section 3. Any unlicensed performance in any manner of a dramatic work
infringes. Mayor v. Eden Musee Co., 102 N. Y. 593, 595;
Russell v. Smith, 12 Q. B. 217, 236.
Selling copies of the separate number gave no implied
license to perform it publicly. Act, § 41; § 1 (a), (b), (d),
(e); Chappell v. Boosey, 21 Ch. Div. (1882), 232-236.
Mr. Louis J. Vorhaus, with whom Mr. Moses H. Grossman and Mr. William Grossman were on the brief, for
petitioner in No. 433.
Mr. Levi Cooke, with whom Mr. A. S. Gilbert and Mr.
FrancisGilbert were on the brief, for respondent in No. 427:
The vocal number is not a dramatico-musical composition. Fuller v. Blackpool Winter Garden, 2 Q. B. (1895),
429, 442.
The dramatic performing right was not infringed. Copyright Act, § 5 (d), (e); Copyright Office Regulations, 8-d,
9, 10-e; Bowker on Copyright, pp. 162, 163.
The performance was not "for profit." It is not the
purpose for which a free performance is given, but the
fact whether or not it is free, which determines whether
the performance is "for profit" within the purview of the
act. The music was not a necessary incident to the service
of food, and the guest who paid for a meal could not insist

Opinion of the Court.

on music while he ate. The time and place of performance,
and whether any performance at all was given, rested in
the discretion of the hotel. Music was furnished only at
certain times and meals at all hours, with no difference
in the charge therefor when music was furnished. While
the purpose was to amuse and attract guests, whether it
was actually accomplished is a matter of pure conjecture;
the song "Sweethearts" may have driven more patrons
from the dining-room than it lured into it.
The words "for profit" are expressly defined in § 1 of
the act, with reference to coin-operated machines. The
legislative intent is the same in each case. The Sarpy
Case, 99 Law Times, 317, is distinguishable, and Weistblatt v. Bingham, 58 Misc. (N. Y.) 328, is overcome by
People v. Martin, 137 N. Y. Supp. 377; People v. Wacke, 77
Misc. (N. Y.) 196; and People v. Royal, 23 App. Div. 258.
The enumeration in § 28 is not exclusive. To so hold
would render the provisions of § 1 (e) meaningless.
Congress did not intend the far-reaching consequences
of a decision sustaining appellant's contention.
Mr. Charles J. Campbell, with whom Mr. Frank A. K.
Boland and Mr. Levi Cooke were on the brief, for respondents in No. 433.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

These two cases present the same question: whether the
performance of a copyrighted musical composition in a
restaurant or hotel without charge for admission to hear it
infringes the exclusive right of the owner of the copyright
to perform the work publicly for profit. Act of March 4,
1909, c. 320, § 1 (e), 35 Stat. 1075. The last numbered
case was decided before the other and may be stated first.
The plaintiff owns the copyright of a lyric comedy in which
is a march called "From Maine to Oregon." It took out a

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Opinion of the Court.

242 U. S.

separate copyright for the march and published it separately. The defendant hotel company caused this march
to be performed in the dining room of the Vanderbilt
Hotel for the entertainment of guests during meal times,
in the way now common, by an orchestra employed and
paid by the company. It was held by the Circuit Court of
Appeals, reversing the decision of the District Court, that
this was not a performance for profit within the meaning
of the act. 221 Fed. Rep. 229. 136 C. C. A. 639.
The other case is similar so far as the present discussion
is concerned. The plaintiffs were the composers and
owners of a comic opera entitled "Sweethearts," containing a song of the same title as a leading feature in the
performance. There is a copyright for the opera and also
one for the song which is published and sold separately.
This the Shanley Company caused to be sung by professional singers, upon a stage in its restaurant on Broadway,
accompanied by an orchestra. The District Court after
holding that by the separate publication the plaintiffs'
rights were limited to those conferred by the separate
copyright, a matter that it will not be necessary to discuss,
followed the decision in 221 Fed. Rep. 229, as to public
performance for profit. 222 Fed. Rep. 344. The decree
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 229 Fed.
Rep. 340. 143 C. C. A. 460.
If the rights under the copyright are infringed only by a
performance where money is taken at the door they are
very imperfectly protected. Performances not different
in kind from those of the defendants could be given that
might compete with and even destroy the success of the
monopoly that the law intends the plaintiffs to have. It is
enough to say that there is no need to construe the statute
so narrowly. The defendants' performances are not
eleemosynary. They are part of a total for which the
public pays, and the fact that the price of the whole is
attributed to a particular item which those present are

expected to order, is not important. It is true that the
music is not the sole object, but neither is the food, which
probably could be got cheaper elsewhere. The object is a
repast in surroundings that to people having limited powers of conversation or disliking the rival noise give a
luxurious pleasure not to be had from eating a silent meal.
If music did not pay it would be given up. If it pays it
pays out of the public's pocket. Whether it pays or not
the purpose of employing it is profit and that is enough.
Decrees reversed.

LA JOYA GRANT, FOR THE BEINEFIT OF THE
OWNERS IN COMMON THEREOF, v. BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF THE BELEN LAND GRANT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW
MEXICO.
No. 129.

Argued December 22, 1916.-Decided January 22, 1917.

The Court of Private Land Claims derived all of its powers from the
Act of March 3, 1891, c. 539, 26 Stat. 854.
Under that act the Court of Private Land Claims had no jurisdiction
in confirming a grant and supervising its survey to extend the confirmation and boundaries over land included in another grant confirmed by Congress and patented before the passage of the act, or
to alter the boundaries of such other grant as so confirmed and as
described in the patent.
So held, where both grants were complete and perfect before the Mexican cession, and the grant confirmed by Congress was senior in
time of grant.
Such jurisdiction could not be conferred on the Court of Private Land
Claims by consent of the owners of the grant confirmed by Congress.
20 N. Mex. 145, affirmed.
