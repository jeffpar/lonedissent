want of uniformity applies equally to the adoption of tile
laws in force in 1917. Furthermore we are not called on.
now to consider the collateral effects of the act. The
only question before us is whether the words in the Constitution, "The judicial power shall extend to
all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" prohibit Congress from passing a law in the form of the New
York Workmen's Compensation Act-if not in its present
form, at least in the form in which it stood on October 6,
1917. I am of opinion that the New York law at the time
of the trial should be applied and that the judgment
should be affirmed.

JUSTICE CLARKE concur in this opinion.

CALHOUN v. MASSIE.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE
STATE OF VIRGINIA.
No. 294.. Argued March 11, 1920.-Decided May 17, 1920.
An agreement that the fee of an attorney for successfully prosecuting
a claim against the United States shall be a lien upon any warrant
that may be issued in payment of the claim is void under Rev. Stats.,
§ 3477. P. 175.
Section 4 of the Omnibus Claims Act of March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38 Stat.
962, in its limitation of the amount that may be paid to or received
by an attorney on account of services rendered or advances made
in connection with any claim for which the act made appropriation,
does not refer merely to the specific funds received from the Government, but makes payment or receipt in excess of the limitation unlawful whatever the source. Id.
This broader prohibition is within the power of Congress as applied

to a contract made and substantially performed by the attorney,
before Congress and in the Court of Claims, before the act was passed
but respecting a claim as to which no right of recovery existed under
any act of Congress when the contract was made and which depended
for its recognition on the action of Congress in making an appropriation. P. 175.
In such a case, the attorney's contract being to secure the appropriation, the passage of the appropriation is a condition precedent to his
client's liability to him, and, Congress having power to condition
such appropriations and having been accustomed so to limit attorney's fees, such a limitation may be taken to have been within
the contemplation of the parties and impliedly assented to by the
attorney in making his contract. P. 176.
Where an attorney for a claimant receives the full amount allowed him
out of the specific fund appropriated under an act which limits his
fee to that amount any contract to the contrary notwithstanding,
he takes under the act and can not repudiate its provisions, and any
verbal reservation of his rights under the contract is futile. P. 177.

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The Omnibus Claims Act (March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38
Stat. 962),made appropriations for the payment of 1,115

claims arising out of the Civil War which had, fron time
to time during the preceding twenty-eight yeark, been

referred by resolution of the House or of the Senate to
the Court of Claims for investigationj either under the
Bowman Act (March 3, 1883, c. 116, 22 Stat. 485), or

505), or under § 151 of the Judicial Code. Among the
claims which that court reported favorably was one of
Bland Massie, which had been referred to it by resolution
of the House on February 3, 1911.1 By section 1 of the
Omnibus Claims Act (p. 989), the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay Massie $1,900. Section 4 of the
act (p. 996), provided as follows:
"That no part of the amount of any item appropriated
in this bill in excess of twenty percentum thereof shall be
paid or delivered to or received by any agent or agents,
attorney or attorneys on account of services rendered or
advances made in connection with said claim.
"It shall be unlawful for any agent or agents, attorney
or attorneys to exact, collect, withhold or receive any
sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty percentum
of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill' on
account- of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person violating the provisions of
this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not
exceeding $1,000."
Massie had executed on April 18, 1911, an agreement
as follows:
"Fee Agreement. This Agreement, witnesseth: that
I, Bland Massie, of Tyro, Nelson County, Virginia, have
employed C. C. Calhoun, of Washington. D. C., as my
attorney to prosecute my claim against the Government
of the United States for property taken by the Federal
forces during the late Civil War, and in consideration of
his professional services in the prosecution of said claim I
hereby agree and bind my heirs and legal representatives,
to pay him, his heirs or legal representatives as a fee a
sum equal to 50 per cent. of the amount which may

be collected upon said claim, said fee to be a lien on any
warrant which may be issued in payment of said claim."
Calhoun prosecuted Massie's claim before the Court
of Claims and secured the allowance of a motion to transmit its report to Congress, which thereafter made the
appropriation above stated. On May 5, 1915, the Government paid the $1,900 by means of two Treasury warrants,
one for $380 (twenty per cent. thereof) made payable to
Calhoun, the other for $1,520 (eighty per cent. thereof)
made payable to Massie. Calhoun demanded of Massie
a further sum of $570, equal to thirty per cent. of the
claim. Payment was refused; and he brought this suit
in a state court of Virginia to recover the amount, claiming
that the warrant for twenty per cent. had been accepted
by him without waiving or releasing his right under the
contract to the balance. A declaration setting forth in
substance the above facts was demurred to on the ground
that recovery was prohibited by § 4 of the act under which
the appropriation was made. The demurrer was sustained
and judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of Virginia (123 Virginia, 673). The case comes here on writ of certiorari (249
U. S. 596), Calhoun having contended in both lower courts,
as here, that § 4 deprives him of liberty and property guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and hence is void.
For nearly three-quarters of a century Congress has
undertaken to control in some measure the conditions
under which claims against the Government may be
prosecuted. Its purpose has been in part to protect just
claimants from extortion or improvident bargains and
in part to protect the Treasury from frauds and imposition.

of securing such services if contingent fees were prohibited,
Taylor v. Bemiss, 110 U. S. 42, 45, Congress has manifested
its belief that the causes which gave rise to laws against
champerty and maintenance'are persistent. By the
enactment, from time to time, of laws prohibiting the
assignment of claims and placing limitations upon the
fees properly chargeable for services 1 Congress has sought
both to prevent the stirring up of unjust claims against
the Government and to reduce the temptation to adopt
improper methods of prosecution which contracts for
large fees contingent upon success have sometimes been
supposed to encourage. The constitutionality of such
legislation, although resembling in its nature the exercise
of the police power, has long been settled (Marshall v.

Opinion of the Court.

States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343, 354, 355; Ball v. Halsell, 161
U. S.72, 82, 84).
The provision in the contract sued on purporting to
give a lien upon any warrant issued was void under § 3477
of the Revised Statutes, Nutt v. Knut, 200 U. S. 12, 20.
It is urged that the act here in question should be construed
as limiting only the proportion of the specific funds received from the Government which may be applied to
payment of attorneys' fees; but the second paragraph
of the law leaves no room for construction. It provides
that: "It shall be unlawful for any . . . attorney
to
.
receive any sum which in the aggregate
exceeds twenty per centum " of the claim. Calhoun
contends, however, that if the act is construed as limiting
the amount recoverable from a claimant upon his personal
obligation, it is void as applied to contracts in existence at
the time of its passage; at least where, as here, the services contemplated had then been substantially performed.
That an act limiting the compensation of attorneys
in the prosecution of claims against the Government is
valid also as to contracts which had been entered into
before its passage was expressly held in Ball v. Halsell,
supra. The act there in question was passed seventeen
years after the date of the contract, and the attorney had
performed important services before its enactment. Here,
it is said, substantially all the services required of Calhoun had been performed when the act was passed. The
difference in the percentage of services performed cannot
here affect the legal result. An appropriate exercise by a
State of its police power is consistent with the Fourteenth
Amendment, although it results in serious depreciation
of property values; and the United States may, consistently with the Fifth Amendment, impose for a permitted
purpose, restrictions upon property which produce like
results. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 357; Hipolite Egg
Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 45, 58; Hoke v. United

States, 227 U. S. 308, 323; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146. The sovereign
right of the Government is not less because the property
affected happens to be a contract. Louisville & Nashville
R. R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 484; Union Dry Goods
Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, 248 U. S. 372.
Here, unlike New York Central & Hudson River R. R. Co.
v. Gray, 239 U. S. 583, 587, a performance of a substitute
for the obligation undertaken and later prohibited by the
statute is impossible, because the act forbids the collection
or receipt of any compensation in excess of twenty per cent.
In the case at bar there are special reasons why the
contract cannot prevail over the statute enacted later.
At the time when the contract was entered into there was
no legislation general or special which conferred upon
Massie any right of recovery even if he should establish
to the satisfaction of Congress that his claim was equitable.
A statute making an appropriation to pay the claim was
thus a condition precedent to liability on the part of
Massie to Calhoun; and the thing contracted for was
Calhoun's aid in securing its enactment. The aid was to
be given by representing Massie before the Court of
Claims. But both of the parties knew that, although Calhoun might have success before the Court of Claims,
Congress would still be free to refuse both to recognize
the claim as an equitable one and to make an appropriation
for its payment. They also knew that if it concluded to
grant relief, Congress was free to do so upon such conditions as it deemed proper. Compare Ball v. Halsell,
supra, pp. 82, 84; Kendall v. United States, 7 Wall. 113,
117. In view of the past action of Congress limiting
attorneys' fees, referred to above, it was at least coneivable when the contract was made that Congress might,
as it proved,1 be unwilling to enact any legislation without
assuring itself that the benefits thereof would not inure

largely to others than those named in the act. Assent by
Calhoun to the insertion in the act of a condition such as
this, which he might reasonably have contemplated would
be required to ensure its passage, was, therefore, implied
in the contract to aid in securing the legislation. Compare
The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, 244 U. S. 12, 22-23.
Furthermore, Calhoun accepted and received from the
Treasury a warrant for twenty per cent. of the sum appropriated. The money was paid and it was received
under the act which provided that it was unlawful to
collect any sum in excess of twenty per cent. "any contract to the contrary notwithstanding." Calhoun cannot
take under the act and repudiate its provisions. Compare
Shepard v. Barron, 194 U. S. 553, 567; Grand Rapids &
Indiana Ry. Co. v. Osborn, 193 U. S. 17, 29; Interstate
Consolidated Street Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, 207 U. S. 79.
The allegation in the declaration that he accepted the
twenty per cent. "without waiving or releasing any of his
rights under the aforesaid contract" was doubtless intended as a statement that the amount collected from the
Government was not accepted as a full settlement of his
rights against the defendant under the contract. But it
was a protestation totally at variance with his conduct.
The payment to him by the Treasury of the twenty per
cent. could be made only under the act. It must be held
to have been accepted according to the terms of the act.
Any reservation which he may have made in words was
futile. Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, 250 U. S. 208, 218,

Calhoun performed his full part in strict accordance
with the contract. As a result of his proper efforts, Congress finally approved the claim and appropriated $1,900
to pay it (Act March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38 Stat. 962, 989).
But the same act, § 4 (p. 996), provided that not more
than twenty per cent. of the amount appropriated should
be paid, or delivered to, or received by, any attorney for
services, etc. Also "It shall be unlawful for any agent or
agents, attorney or attorneys to exact, collect, withhold or
receive any sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty
per centum of the amount of any item appropriated in this
bill on account of services rendered or advances made in
connection with said claim, any contract to the contrary
rnotwithstanding. Any person violating the provisions of
this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not
exceeding $1,000."
Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, 250 U. S.208, affirms the
power of Congress to exempt the appropriated fund from
any demand for counsel fees.
In that case Calhoun, relying upon a contract like the
one presently before us, recovered a judgment in the
state court for the difference between twenty per cent.
received from the Treasury and fifty per cent. of the
appropriation. The matter came here and we expressly
declared (p. 216): "If the judgment only establishes a
claim against the administrator to be satisfied, not out of
the moneys received from the United States but from
other assets of the estate, a situation is presented which it
was said in Nutt v. Knut, 200 U. S. 12, 21, would not
encounter legal objection. In other words, the limitation

in the act appropriating the money to 20% as the amount
to be paid. to an agent or attorney would have no application or be involved." In effect, the court now holds that
statement was obviously erroneous; and that Calhoun
would have committed a misdemeanor if he had accepted
a fee exceeding the twenty per cent!
As to certain "special reasons why the contract cannot prevail over the statute enac'ted later."
(1) It is said that when he executed the contract of
employment, Calhoun impliedly assented to the insertion
in any future appropriation act of a condition like the one
under consideration; therefore, he cannot recover. This
assumes, first, a construction of the act in direct conflict
with the meaning heretofore attfibuted to it and, second,
that so construed it is within the power of. Congress. If
these two assumptions are correct, of course there is no right
to recover. This special reason can only serve to mislead.
(2) It is further said that as Calhoun received twenty
per cent. of the amount appropriated by'an act which
declared unlawful the collection of anything more, he
thereby in effect estopped himself-from making a personal
demand against his client. But this again assumes a construction of the act contrary to what we have declared,
and further assumes that so construed it is valid. If these
assumptions are correct no further discussion is needed.
This special reason lacks substance and can serve no good
purpose.
The meaning of Section 4.
Considering the definite statement concerning the true
meaning of this section made twelve months ago in
Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, 250 U. S. 208, and quoted
above, it would seem at least unusual now to announce a
wholly different view ,accompanied by the mere assertion
that there is "no room for construction." No mention

is made of what was then said in very plain terms. Of
course this has been acLepted as authoritative both by
lawyers and courts. The result is necessarily injurious
both to the court and the public.
In United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.
366, 408, this was said: "Where a statute is susceptible of
two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful
constitutional questions arise and by the other of which
such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter."
As that statement has been repeated several times it would
seem worthy of some consideration now.
I presume nobody doubts that Congress has power to
prescribe reasonable rules concerning champerty, maintenance or kindred matters in United States courts, and
to regulate assignments of claims against the Government.
But, under the adopted construction, § 4 (Act of March 4,
1915), destroys an entirely lawful contract made long
before its passage, deprives counsel of his right to enforce
the personal Jiability of his client to pay for services
already performed, and renders criminal the acceptance
by him of more than an arbitrarily specified amount.
Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 16 How. 314,
316; United States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343, 354, 355; Ball v.
Halsell, 161 U. S. 72, 84, are referred to as authority for
such oppressive legislation. They give it no support.
Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., was an attempt
to collect compensation for lobbying; and the holding was
that a contract is void, as against public policy, and can
have no standing in court by which one party stipulates
to employ a number of secret agents in order to obtain the
passage of a particular law by the legislature of a State,
and the other party promises to pay a large sum of money
in case the law should pass. The case appears unimportant
in connection with this controversy.
In United States v. Hall the court ruled, Congress has
power to declare that embezzlement or fraudulent con-

version to his own use by a guardian of pension money
received on behalf of his ward from the Government is an
offense against the United States. This case might be
relevant if Calhoun were seeking to reach the fund appropriated by Congress; but he is not.
In Ball v. Halsell, an attorney sought to recover under
a written agreement, concerning which this court said
(p. .82): "The instrument was an unilateral contract, not
signed by the attorney, nor containing any agreement
on his part, and-so long, at least, as it had not been
carried into execution-might be revoked by the principal;
or might be disregarded by him in making a settlement
with the United States; or might be treated by him as
absolutely null and void in any contest between him and
the attorney.

.

.

.

By the very terms of the contract,

the attorney was to be paid only out of money recovered
and received by him from the United States." The case
is wholly unlike the one now before us. Mr. Justice Gray
took pains to explain the difference between it and Davis
v. Commonwealth, '164 Massachusetts, 241, where the
Massachusetts court ruled that. an agent of the State
employed to prosecute a claim against the United States
could recover compensation notwithstanding the act of
Congress appropriating money to meet the claim provided that no part of such sum should be paid by the
State to any attorney under previous contract.
Davis v. Commonwealth and the language by Mr. Justice
Gray in Ball v. Halsell wherein he pointed out the clear
distinction between the two cases, ought not to be lightly
dizregarded.
It is certainly a very serious thing to decide that Con-

gress, by its arbitrary fiat, may Wholly deprive counsel
of the right to enforce payment of compensation for long
continued efforts theretofore lawfully put forth, and
prevent him, indeed, from accepting- anything therefor.
If a limit may be set at twenty per cent. any payment may

be proscribed. We should follow Capital Trust Co.-.v.
Calhoun, and reverse the judgment below.
The Fifth Amendment was intended to protect the

individual against arbitrary exercise of federal power. It
declares, no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property, without due process of law; and this inhibition
protects every man in his right to engage in honest and

useful work for compensation.
