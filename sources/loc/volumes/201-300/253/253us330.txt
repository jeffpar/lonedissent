intangible property which is fairly represented by and
must be included, in order to place a just value on the
tangible property located and the business transacted
there. 'The conclusion drawn by them is that the situs of
the intangible property must be with the tangible; otherwise, they say, we must bold that it is in two places at once
and that it may be subjected to double taxation. To this
it is sufficient to say that the Fourteenth Amendment does
not prohibit double taxation. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517,

APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

Nos. 319, 320.

Argued April 30, 1920.-Decided June 1, 1920.

When the Government without condemnation proceedings appropriates with legislative authority private property for a public use,
it impliedly promises to pay therefor, but in order that the Government be liable it must appear that the officer taking possession of the
property is authorized so to do by Congress or by the official on
whom Congress conferred the power. P. 333.
The Acts of March 3, 1899, c. 423, 30 Stat. 1064, 1070, and of May 26,
1900, c. 586, 31 Stat. 205, 213, making appropriations for quarters
.for troops, sufficiently authorize the Secretary of War to take land
for this purpose, but vest no authority in a general commanding a
department. Held, that the action of the general in taking possession of the land was tortious and no liability on the part of the
Government was created until the action was approved by the

Opinion of the Court.

Secretary of War, and since this approval occurred within six years
before the commencement of this suit the suit was not barred by § 156
of the Judicial Code. P. 333.
The President's order reserving a tract largely public land, "subject to any legal rights which may exist to any land within its limits"
did not mean that private land actually occupied for a public use
was not taken, but merely that the right to compensation was recognized, and, in any event, the continued occupation of the private
land and the erection of buildings thereon was such an appropriation as would give rise to a cause of action against the Government.
P. 334.
The right to bring a suit against the United States in the Court of
Claims for private property taken for a public purpose without condemnation proceedings is not founded on the Fifth Amendment but
on the existence of an implied contract to pay the value of the property as of the date of the taking, and interest may not be added, because of § 177 of the Judicial Code. P. 335.
While interest might be allowed in condemnation proceedings instituted by the United States against the owner of property taken
for a public purpose, as compensation for the use and occupation of
the land prior to the passage of the title, it cannot be recovered in a
suit in the Court of Claims against the United States. P. 336.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, with whom The
Solicitor General and Mr. R. P. Whiteley were on the brief,
for the United States.
Mr. Burt E. Barlow, with whom Mr. Abram R. Serves
was on the brief, for the North American Transportatio:i
& Trading Co.
MR. JUSTIE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
This suit was brought by the North American Tramportation and Trading Company in the Court of Claims
on December 7, 1906. The petitioner seeks to recover the

value of a placer mining claim situated on the public land
near Nome, Alaska, which is alleged to have been taken by'
the Government on December 8, 1900, and also compensation for use and occupation thereof after that date.
Ownership of the property by the company and the
physical taking and continued possession of it by the
Government were not controverted. The lower court
found, also, that about July 1, 1900, General Randall,
United States Army, commanding the Department of
Alaska, took possession, as a site for an army post, of
a large tract of public land which included the mining
claim. The company yielded possession of the part
occupied by it, being unable to withstand his authority;.
but at the same time it demanded compensation which
General Randall promised would be paid. Use of the site
for an army post was thereafter recommended by him to
the Secretary of War. Pursuant to this recommendation,
the President issued on December 8, 1900, an order by
which the tract was reserved from sale and set aside for
military purposes; and on December 20, 1900, the'Secietary of War announced it as a public reservation, for the
present under the control of the War Department. The
tract has been used as an army post continuously since
possession was first taken by General Randall. The
buildings erected thereon are situated on that portion of
the land which had been the company's placer claim; so
that at no time since General Randall took possession of
the land has the company been able to operate its claim or
do any further mining work thereon.
The Government contended that, if on the facts there
was a legal taking or other act entitling petitioner to
recover compensation, the cause of action had accrued
more than six years prior to the commencement of this
suit; and that therefore under § 156 of the Judicial Code
the petition should be dismissed. The Court of Claims
found that the company's property was taken within the

six years; that is, on December 8, 1900, and that its then
reasonable value was $23,800. It entered judgment for
that amount (53 Ct. Clms. 424). Both parties appealed;
the Government, on the ground that the right of recovery,
if any, was barred; the company, on the ground that no
compensation was allowed for the use and occupation
between the date of the taking and the date of entry of
judgment.
First. When the Government without instituting condemnation proceedings appropriates for a public use
under legislative authority private property to which it
asserts no title, it impliedly promises to pay therefor.
United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., 112 U. S.
645; United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 462, 465;
United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 329. But although
Congress may have conferred upon the Executive Department power to take land for a given purpose, the Government will not be deemed to have so appropriated private
property, merely because some officer thereafter takes
possession of it with a view to effectuating the general
purpose of Congress. See Ball Engineering Co. v. J. G.
White & Co., 250 U. S. 46, 54-57. In order that the
Government shall be liable it must appear that the officer
who has physically taken possession of the property was
duly authorized so to do, either directly by Congress or by'
the official upon whom Congress conferred the power.
The Acts of March 3, 1899, c. 423, 30 Stat.. 1064, 1070,
and May 26, 1900, c. 586, 31 Stat. 205, 213, making appropriations for barracks and quarters for troops, furnish
sufficient authorization from Congress to take land for
such purposes, so that the difficulty encountered by the
claimant in Hooe v. United States, 218 U. S. 322, does not
exist here. But the power granted by those acts was
conferred upon the Secretary of War. Act of August 1,
1888, c. 728, § 1, 25 Stat. 357; Act of August 18, 1890, c.
797, § 1, 26 Stat. 316. It was for him to determine whether

the army post should be established and what land should
be taken therefor. Compare Nahant v. United States, 136
Fed. Rep. 273; 153 Fed. Rep. 520;. United States v. Certain
Lands in Narragansett,R. I., 145 Fed. Rep. 654. Power to
take possession of the company's mining claim was not
vested by law in General Randall; and the Secretary of
War had not, so far as appears, either authorized it or
approved it before December 8, 1900. It was only after
the President reserved from sale and set aside for military
purposes the large tract of land in which the company's
mining claim was included that the Secretary of War took
action which may be deemed an approval or ratification of
what General Randall had done. What he had done before
that date, having been without authority and hence
tortious, created no liability on the part of the Government. Hijo v. United States, 194 U. S. 315, 323. Since the
cause of action arose after December 7, 1900, this suit was
not barred by § 156 of the Judicial Code.
The suggestion is made that, as the President's order
reserved the land "subject to any legal rights which may
exist to any land within its limits," the Secretary's action
thereafter was not a taking of the mining claim. But
this clause and the reference to it in the announcement
made by the Secretary must, in view of the circumnstances,
have meant merely that the right to compensation of
the company and of any others was preserved. Furthermore, the suggestion if sound would not aid the Government; it would result, at most, in slightly postponing the
date of the legal taking. For the continued holding possession of the land after the announcement of the Secretary of War and the erection of buildings thereon by his
authority was such an appropriation as would, in any
event, give the right of action against the Government.
Second. The company contends that it should
receive,
in addition to the value of the property at the time of
the taking, compensation for the occupation and use

Opinion of the Court.

thereof from that date to the date of the judgment-a
period of nearly twenty years during which the company
was deprived of the use of its property. This contention.
is based upon the decisions of many state courts that,
upon the taking of private property for public uses, the
owner is entitled to recover, besides its value at the time
of the taking, interest thereon from the date on which
lie was deprived of its use to the date of payment.1 In a
number of cases in the lower federal courts also the landowner has been permitted to recover interest from the
time of the taking; but in each such case a statute had
provided in some form that the condemnation should
be conducted according to the laws of the State in which
the land was situated-and under the law of the State
interest was recoverable. United States v. Engeman, 46
Fed. Rep. 898; Town of Hingham v. United States, 161
Fed. Rep. 295, 300; United States v. Sargent, 162 Fed.
Rep. 81; United States v. First National Bank, 250 Fed.
Rep. 299; United States v. Rogers, 257 Fed. Rep. 397;
United States v. Highsmith, 257 Fed. Rep. 401. These
conformity provisions which relate only to the laws of
States, can have no application to lands in Alaska; nor
can they affect proceedings brought in the Court of Claims.
The right to bring this suit against the United States
in the Court of Claims is not founded upon the Fifth
Amendment, Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163,
168; Basso v. United States, 239 U. S. 602, but upon the
existence of an implied contract entered into by the
United States. Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341;
Bigby v. United States, 188 U. S. 400; Tempel v. United
States, 248 U. S. 121, 129; United States v. Great Falls
Manufacturing Co., supra; United States v. Lynah, supra.
And the contract which is implied is to pay the value of
property as of the date of the taking. Bauman v. Ross,

167 U. S. 548, 587; United States v. Honolulu Plantaiion
Co., 122 Fed. Rep. 581, 585; Burt v. Merchants' Insurance
Co., 115 Massachusetts, 1, 14. Interest may not be added
because § 177 of the Judicial Code, re-enacting § 1091
of the Revised Statutes, declares that: "No interest
shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the Court of Claims, unless
upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of
interest." Tillson v. United States, 100 U. S. 43. Congress, in thus denying to the court power to award interest,
adopted the common-law rule that delay or default in
payment (upon which, in the absence of express agreement, the right to recover interest rests), cannot be attributed to the sovereign. United Scates v. North Carolina,
136 U. S. 211, 216. That rule had theretofore been uniformly applied in our executive departments except
where statutes provided otherwise. United States v.
Sherman, 98 U. S. 565, 567-8. So rigorously is the rule
applied, that, in the adjustment of mutual claims between
an individual and the Government, the latter has been
held entitled to interest on its credits although relieved
from the payment of interest on the charges against it.
United State;3 v. Verdier, 164 U. S. 213, 218-219. This
denial of interest, like the refusal to tax costs against the
United States in favor of the prevailing party, Stanley v.
Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255, 272; Pine River Logging Co. v.
United States, 186 U. S. 279, 296, and the refusal to hold
the United States liable for torts committed by its officers
and agents in the ordinary course of business, Crozier v.
Krupp, 224 U. S. 290, are hardships from which, with
rare exceptions, William Cramp & Sons Co. v. Curtis
Turbine Co., 246 U. S. 28, 40-41, Congress has been unwilling to relieve those who either voluntarily deal with
the Government or are otherwise affected by its acts.
The company argues that interest is allowed in condemnation proceedings, not qua interest for default or

delay in paying the value, but as the measure of compensation for the use and occupation during the period which
precedes the passing of the title (see Klages v. Philadelphia
& Reading Terminal Co., 160 Pa. St. 386); and that collection of an amount, measured by interest, is not prohibited either by the statute limiting the powers of the
Court of Claims or by the common-law rule which exempts
the sovereign from liability to pay interest. United States
v. New York, 160 U. S. 598, 622. This may be the theory
on which interest should be allowed in compensation
proceedings;' and it may be that, even in the absence of
the conformity provision referred to above, interest could
be collected as a part of the just compensation in condemnation proceedings brought by the Government.
For, as suggested in United States v. Sargent, supra, such
a proceeding is not a suit by the landowner to collect a
claim against the United States, but an adversary proceeding in which the owner is the defendant and which
the Government institutes in order to secure title to land.
Maxon City & Fort Dodge R. R. Co. v. Boynton, 204 U. S.
570. On the other hand, this suit brought in the Court
of Claims is a very different proceeding. It is an action of
contract to recover money which the United States is
assumed to have promised to pay; and the assumed promise was to pay the value at the time of the taking. The
suit is in effect an action on two counts--one for the value
of the mining claim, the other for use and occupation
after December 8, 1900, at the rate of $7,500 per year.
If the company had brought the suit immediately after
the taking, it clearly could not have recovered any amount
for use and occupation; for a plaintiff suing in contract

can recover only on a cause of action existing at the time
the suit was brought. The loss to the company of the
use of $23,800, which is found to be the value of the mining claim when it was taken nearly twenty years ago, must
be deemed to be due, in part, to its delay in instituting
the suit, and, in part, to the delays of litigation for which
it may have been largely responsible. But as, in either
event, the loss of the use of the money results from the
failure to collect sooner a claim held to have accrued when
the company's property was taken, that which the company
seeks to recover is, in substance, interest, and that Congress
has denied to the Court of Claims power to allow.
Furthermore, if it is not interest which the company
seeks, the facts found fail to supply the basis on which any
claim in addition to that for the value of the property
should rest. The petition states that. the United States
is indebted to claimant in addition to the $100,000, alleged
to be the value of the property, the further sum of $7,500
per a num for the use and occupancy thereof from December 8, 1900. Except for this allegation the company did not,
so far as appears, make any request of any kind in the court
below in respect to an allowance for use and occupation.
The court does not mention the subject in the opinion; and
it is not referred to in the application for an appeal..,-,,
In Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S.282, 321, and
Bauman v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, 598, to which both counsel
refer, the point here decided was not involved, since the
court held that under the express terms of the acts there
in question the United States were not entitled to possession of the land until the damages had been assessed
and actually paid.
