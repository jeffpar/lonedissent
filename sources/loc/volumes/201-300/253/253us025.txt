BROADWELL v. CARTER COUNTY.
17.

Opinion of the Court.

The county calls attention to the fact that in the demurrer to the petition the statute of limitation (probably
meaning ยง 1570, Rev. Laws 1910), was relied on. This!
point was not discussed by the Supreme Court and we are
not concerned with it beyond observing that when the case
is remanded it will be open to that court to deal with the
point as to the whole claim or any item in it as any valid
local law in force when the claim was filed may require.
Motion to dismiss denied.
Judgment reversed.

Regardless of the use made of it, a power resulting, not from normal
expansion and legitimate business enterprise, but from deliberate
calculated purchase for control, which enables a holding company
to dominate two great competing interstate railroad carriers and
two great competing coal companies, engaged extensively in mining
and selling anthracite coal that must be transported to interstate
markets over those railroads, is a menace to and an undue restraint
