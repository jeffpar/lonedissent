tice, that the apprehended effect of an unfair method in
suppressing competition by destroying rivals could be
averted. As the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the
evidence was sufficient to support the facts set forth above,
and since on those facts the Commission could reasonably
hold that the method of competition in question was unfair
under the circumstances, it had power under the act to
issue the order complained of.
In my opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals should be reversed.

NADEAU ET AL. v. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS.

No. 119. Argued January 9, 12, 1920.-Decided June 7, 1920.
The fact that tracts of land forming parts of the reservation set apart
for the Pottawatomie Indians by the Treaty of 1846, 9 Stat. 853,
became subject to be allotted to individual members of the tribe,
under the Treaty of 1861, 12 Stat. 245, in virtue of occupation and
improvements by such members, did not divest the United States
of the fee to such tracts or prevent the granting of a railroad right
of way across them by act of Congress. P. 446.
Such lands remained "public lands" within the meaning of the Act
of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, granting to the Union Pacific
Railroad Company a right of way 200 feet in width on each side
of said railroad where it may pass over the public lands. P. 444.
Kindred v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 225 U. S. 582.
Upon the identification of the railroad route, the right of way grant
took effect as of the date of the granting act, and was unaffected by
intervening allotments under the last named treaty Qr by the patents
issued subsequently thereunder for the lands so allotted. P. 445-446.

NADEAU v. UNION PACIFIC R. R. CO.
442.

Opinion of the Court.

Land-constituting part of the right of way granted by Congress for the
Union Pacific Railroad cannot be acquired by individuals by adverse
possession.. P. 446.

Affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

-

Mr. A. E. Crane;with whom Mr. Z. T. Hazen and Mr.
J. B. Larimer were on 'the briefs, for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. R. W. Blair and Mr. N. H. Loomis- with whom Mr.
H. W. Clark was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOYDS delivered the opinion of the
court.

Defendant in error brought this action to obtain possession of certain lands, formerly part of the Pottawatomie
Indian Reservation and now in Pottawatomie County,.
Kansas, which lie in the margins of the 400-foot strip
claimed by it as legal successor to the original grantee.
Counsel for plaintiffs in error well say, but one question is
presented for our determination-'" Were thd lands
involved in this action 'public lands ' wifhin the meaning
of the acts of Congress dated July 1, 1862, and July 2,
1864, granting a right of way to the Leavenworth, Pawnee
& Western Railway Company and its successors?"
The cause was tried by the court below upon pleadings
and Agreed Statement of Facts; and amemorandum states
the reasons for judgment favorable to the iailroad.
By the Act of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, Congress
granted a right of way "two hundred feet in width on each
side of said railroad Where it may pass over the public
lands" (Stuart v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 227 U. S. 342,
345), and declared "The United States shall extinguish as
rapidly as may be the Indian titles to all lands falling
under the operation of this act and required for the said

right-of way and grants hereinafter' made."
Some
amendments added by the Act of July 3, 1866, c. 159, 14
Stat. 79, are not specially important here.
It is said that under treaties of 1846 and 1861 with the
United States (9 Stat. 853; 12 Stat. 245) the Pottawatomie Reservation was no part of the "public lands ";
moreover, that Congress lacked power to grant rights
therein to a railroad company.
In Kindred v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 225 U. S.582,
596, lands in the Delaware Diminished Indian Reservation-east of the Pottawatomies-were declared "public
lands" within the intendment of the right-of-way clause,
Act of 1862, although then actually occupied by individual
members of the Tribe under assignments executed as
provided by treaty. That case renders clear the definite
purpose of Congress to treat Indian Reservations, subject
to its control, as public lands within the right-of-way
provision. This provision is not to be regarded as
bestowing bounty on the'railroad; it stands upon a somewhat different footing from private grants and should
receive liberal construction favorable to the purposes in
view. United States v. Denver & Rio Grande Ry. Co., 150
U. S. 1, 8, 14.
Whether Congress had power to make grants in respect
of the lands here involved must be determined upon a
consideration of their history.
November 14, 1862, the railroad company accepted the
Act of 1862, and during 1865 and 1866 duly constructed
its road through the Pottawatomie Reservation-so far
as appears, without protest or objection.
By the Treaty of. 1846-Article 4-the United States
agreed to grant to the Pottawatomie Indians possession
and title to i district thirty miles square, on the Kansas
River, and to guarantee full and complete possession
thereof "as their land and. home forever." 9 Stat. 854.
In 1861 the same parties entered into another treaty

which stipulated-Articles 1 and 2-that land within the
Reservation designated by the Treaty of 1846 should be
allotted thereafter in severalty to tribal members who had
acquired customs of the whites, and desired separate
tracts; that the United States' agent should take an
accurate census showing those desiring to hold in severalty
and those desiring to hold in common, and "thereupon
there shall be assigned, under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs," specified -amounts of land "to
include, in every case, as far as practicable, to each family,
their improvements and a reasonable portion of timber, to
be selected according to the legal subdivision of the
survey."' "When such assignments shall have been
completed, certificates shall be issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the tracts assigned in severalty,
specifying the names of the individuals to whom they have
been assigned, respectively, and that said tracts are set
apart for the perpetual and exclusive use and benefit of
such assignees and their heirs."
Article 5, Treaty of 1861, offered certain privileges to the
railroad company Which were never accepted; the road was
not constructed as provided by the treaty, but under the
act of Congress.
Subsequent to July 1, 1862, a census was duly taken;
commissioners, appointed January 16, 1863, made allotments, and in November, 1863, submitted their report.
The Secretary of the Interior, December 12, 1864, approved allotments for the lands now involved to tribal
members having improvements thereofi before the Treaty
of 1861, and who had continued to live there. Patents
thereto issued at different dates, the earliest being
June 14, 1867, without expressly reserving a right of way
for the railroad. Plaintiffs in error claim through mesne
conveyances from those who received such allotments
and patents.
it seems plain that, at least, until actually allotted in

severalty (1864) the lands were but part of, the domain
held by the Tribe under the ordinary Indian claim-the
right of possession and occupancy-with fee in the United
States. Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517, 525. The
power of Congress, as guardian for the Indians, to legislate
in respect of such lands is settled. Cherokee Nation v.
Southern Ka ksas Ry. Co., 135 U. S. 641, 653; United States
v. Rowell, 24 U. S. 464, 468; United States v. Chase,
245 U. S. 89.
The grant of the right of way in 1862, was present and
absolute and, upon identification of the route, took effect
as of the date of the act. All who thereafter acquired
public lands took subject to such granted right. Railroad
Company v. Baldwin, 103 U. S. 426, 430. Although parties
to the Treaty of 186%1 contemplated future allotments, it
made none. No individual title to any portion of the
land arose until allotted, and none'was allotted until
after 1862.
Any claim by plaintiffs in error based upon adverse
occupancy or possession is precluded by Northern Pacific
R. R. Co. v. Smith, 171 U. S. 260; Northern Pacific Ry. Co.
v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v.
Ely, 197 U. S. 1; Kindred v. Union PacificR. R. Co., supra,
597.
We find no error in the judgment below and it is
Affirmed.
