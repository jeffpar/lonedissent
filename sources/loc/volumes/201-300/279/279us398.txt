There was abundant reason for placing oyster packers
in a separate class for taxation purposes. Appellants'
claim that equal protection of the laws will be denied them
is groundless.
The requirement concerning storage for a limited time
of 10% of the empty shells imposes no serious burden, is
but part of the general scheme for taxing the privilege,
and is no heavier than demands to which taxpayers are
often subjected. It is neither oppressive nor arbitrary.
Pierce Oil Corp. v. Hopkins, 264 U. S. 137, 139
Considering the nature of the controversy and the agreement between the parties touching appellants' purpose to
continue in the packing business, it can not be said that
the cause has become moot. United States v. Trans-Missouri FreightAssociation, 166 U. S. 290, 307, 308; Southern

has declared his intention to become a citizen. § 1. P. 400.
2. An alien who, after coming to this country, went to a foreign port
and back as a seaman on an American vessel shipped for the round
voyage, made an entry into the United States, within the meaning
of § 19, when he returned here. P. 401.

CERTIORARI, 278 U. S. 592, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirming an order of the District
Court dismissing a writ of habeas corpus. The merits of
the case were first passed on by the courts below in an
earlier proceeding against the predecessor in office of the
present respondent, which abated in this Court for want
of a timely substitution. See 16 F. (2d) 15; 273 U. S.
688; 276 U. S.590.

Messrs. Silas B. Axtell and Charles A. Ellis submitted
for petitioner.
Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Attorney General Mitchell and Mr.
W. Marvin Smith were on the brief, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner is an alien held upon a warrant issued by the
Assistant Secretary of Labor for deportation under § 19
of the Immigration Act of 1917, U. S. C., Tit. 8, § 155.
On his petition, the district court for the southern district
of New York issued a writ of habeascorpus. Respondent
made return and after a hearing the writ was dismissed.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
Section 19 contains the following: "At any time within
five years after entry . . .any alien who is hereafter sen-

tenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more
because of conviction in this country of a crime involving
moral turpitude, committed within five years after the
entry of the alien to the United States, . . .shall, upon
warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody
and deported."
The facts are not in controversy. Petitioner is a native
and subject of Denmark. He came to this country as a
member of the crew of a British ship and landed at Norfolk January 22, 1912. He shipped the next day on an
American schooner and subsequently served as a seaman
on other American ships. October 19, 1917, he shipped
from New York on the Elisha Atkins for a voyage to
South America and return by way of Cuba; he landed at
Boston, March 26, 1918. That was his last voyage from
foreign ports to the United States. He was subsequently
employed in American coastwise trade and resided for a
time on land as representative of a seamen's labor union.
In June, 1919, he petitioned for naturalization and declared his intention to become a citizen of the United
States. June 17, 1921, in the Cumberland county court
in the State of Maine, he pleaded guilty to a charge of
manslaughter, the killing of James Walker at Portland
on May 21, 1921, and was sentenced to imprisonment for
more than one year. Subsequently a warrant of the Department of Labor was served upon him and after a hearing he wqs ordered to be deported to Denmark upon the
termination of his imprisonment.
The question for decision is whether petitioner was sentenced within five years after his entry into the United
States.
The provision extends to all aliens, that is, every person
not a native-born or naturalized citizen. § 1; U. S. C.,
Tit. 9, § 173. It is immaterial whether he was entitled
to admission or whether he lawfully entered. The cause
for which his deportation was ordered arose after entry.

U. S. v. GALVESTON &c. RY. CO.
Syllabus.

398

Lapina v. Williams, 232 U. S. 78, 91. Lewis v. Frick, 233
U. S. 291. His declared purpose to naturalize does not
serve him here as he had not become a citizen. If his
landing at Boston in 1918 was an entry he is rightly held.
Section 1 provides that "United States" as used in the
Act shall be construed to mean the United States and any
waters, territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction
thereof except the Isthmian Canal Zone. An entry into
the United States is not effected by embarking on an
American vessel in a foreign port. Such a vessel outside
the United States whether on the high seas or in foreign
waters is not a place included within the United States as
defined by the Act. See Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262
U. S. 100, 122. Scharrenbergv. DollarS. S. Co., 245 U. S.
122, 127. The word "entry" by its own force implies a
coming from outside. The context shows that in order
that there be an entry within the meaning of the Act
there must be an arrival from some foreign port or place.
There is no such entry where one goes to sea on board
an American vessel from a port of the United States and
returns to the same or another port of this country without
having been in any foreign port or place. See §§ 19,
32, 33, 35.
And it is clear that petitioner departed from the United
States on the Elisha Atkins and that, when he landed at
Boston on his return from South American and Cuban
ports, he made an entry into the United States within the
Judgment affirmed.
