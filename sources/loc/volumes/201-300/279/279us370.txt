the fraud he has committed on the common carrier, we do
not think that the present statutes bring them within the
scope of the crime denounced, when the common carrier
and its servants are innocent of offense.
It is clear to us that the words "record or memoranda
kept by a carrier" contained in § 20 mean the official
record kept by the carrier and do not refer to bills or
memoranda kept by the contractor as a basis on which
the carrier keeps its records. The defendant's bills or
memoranda are not in that sense a record at all under § 20.
They are not subject to the supervision of the Interstate
Commerce Commission; and it would seem that if the
data proved to be dishonest and incorrect, the punishment for that, unless with the complicity of the common
carrier, must be found elsewhere than in the provisions
of the present Interstate Commerce Act.
This leads us necessarily to affirm the ruling of the District Court.
Affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. THE JOHN BARTH COMPANY
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 526.

Argued April 18, 1929.--Decided May 13, 1929.

1. A limitation of five years declared by §§ 250 (d) of the Revenue
Acts of 1918 and 1921, and § 277 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of
1924, upon the time within which income and profits taxes may be
assessed and suits begun to collect them, is inapplicable to a suit
on a bond given within that time under par. 14 (a), § 234 (a), of
the Revenue Act of 1918, to secure payment, with interest, of taxes
which have been returned and assessed but payment of which has
been postponed pending decision of a claim for abatemont subuaitted by the taxpayer. P. 374,

Opinion of the Court.

2. The making of the bond in such case gives the United States a
cause of action separate and distinct from the already existing cause
of action to collect the taxes; and the taxpayer, by thus securing
postponement of collection, waives the limitation of five years that
would have applied had no bond been given. P. 375.
3. Section 1106 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, providing that the
bar of the statute of limitations against the United States in respect
of any internal revenue taxes shall not only bar the remedy, but
shall extinguish the liability, does not affect an action on a bond
given ut supra. P. 376.

CERTiomRi, 278 U. S. 597, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed a judgment of
the District Court dismissing the complaint in an action
to enforce a bond given by The John Barth Company
and its surety to secure payment of taxes. See also 276
U. S. 606.
Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, with whom
Attorney General Mitchell, and Messrs. Sewall Key and
J. Louis Monarch, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, were on the brief, for the United States.
Messrs. Louis Quarles and Walter H. Moses, with whom
Messrs. Malcolm K. Whyte, S. Sidney Stein, and Richard
S. Doyle were on the brief, for respondents.
MR. CHIEF JUsTICE TAFr delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This was a suit by the United States, through its District Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin,
against the John Barth Company, a corporation of Wisconsin, and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, a corporation of Maryland. The subject matter of
the suit is the recovery of the amount due on a bond in
the sum of $60,000 whereby the respondents bound them-

selves jointly and severally to pay to the United States the
sum therein named under the following circumstances
and conditions.
On June 25, 1919, the United States Commissioner of
Internal Revenue assessed income and profits taxes against
the Barth Company for the year 1918 in the sum of
$126,182.81, and of this sum the company paid $74,764.40.
On September 15, 1919, and March 17, 1925, the company filed claims for the abatement of $39,501.58 of the
taxes thus assessed. The Barth Company as principal,
and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company as
surety, in consideration of the United States' refraining
from and suspending the collection of taxes thus outstanding against the Barth Company for the year 1918, pending
consideration and adjudication of the foregoing claims for
abatement, executed and delivered a bond on September
20, 1919, binding them to pay "on notice and demand
by the collector . . . any part of such tax found by the
Commissioner to be due, with interest at the rate of twelve
per cent. per annum from the time such tax would have
been due, had no such claim been filed."
The Barth Company fied its claim of abatement on the
ground that it had sustained a substantial loss, resulting
from a material reduction of the value of its inventory for
the taxable year and from actual payment after the close
of the taxable year of rebates, in pursuance of contracts entered into during such year upon sales made during the
year.
On March 25, 1926, the Commissioner considered the
claims, allowed about $10,000, and rejected the rest in the
sum of $29,842.32. The Barth Company was notified and
payment under the bond of the tax as determined, with
interest thereon, requested, on February 27, 1926, and on
April 5 and 20, 1926, but the Barth Company refused to
pay. On August 10 and 27, 1926, the Guaranty Corn-

pany was notified of the rejection of the abatement claims
in the sum above stated, and of the amount and interest
due, but that company also refused payment. The suit
was authorized by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
To the petition respondents filed a demurrer "for the
reason that . . . the action was not commenced within
the time limited by law which time is prescribed by Sections 205d [250d] of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921,
and Sections 277a-2, 278d and 278e of the Revenue Act
of 1924, and Sections 277a-3, 278d, 278e, and 1106a of the
Revenue Act of 1926."
The District Court sustained the demurrer, the United
States elected to stand on its complaint, and judgment was
entered dismissing the complaint.
The United States carried the judgment on writ of error
to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which, after an unsuccessful effort to certify to this Court certain questions,
which were dismissed (276 U. S. 606), heard the writ of
error and affirmed the judgment of the -District Court.
27 F. (2d) 782. The case is now here on writ of cer
tiorari.
Par. 14 (a), § 234 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c.
18, 40 Stat. 1057, provides that:
"At the time of filing return for the taxable year 1918
a taxpayer may file a claim in abatement, based on the fact
that he has sustained a substantial loss ... resulting from
any material reduction . . . of the value of the inventory
for such taxable year, or from the actual payment, after
the close of such taxable year, of rebates in pursuance of
contracts entered into during such year upon sales made
during such year. In such case, payment of the amount
of tax covered by such claim shall not be required until
the claim is decided, but the taxpayer shall accompany
his claim with a bond in double the amount of the tax
covered by the claim, with sureties satisfactory to the

Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

Commissioner, conditioned for the payment of any part
of such tax found to be due, with interest. If any part of
such claim is disallowed then the remainder of the tax
due shall on notice and demand by the collector be paid
by the taxpayer with interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per
month from the time the tax would have been due had no
such claim been filed."
In § 250 (d) the provision is:
"Except in the case of false or fraudulent returns with
intent to evade the tax, the amount of tax due under any
return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was
made, and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any
tax shall be begun after the expiration of five years after
the date when the return was due or was made."
Section 250 (d) refers to a failure of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to pass upon the return made by the
taxpayer and to assess the tax. It is the determination
preceding the assessment that is referred to in that section. If there is no determination and assessment within
five years after the return is made, or after the return
should have been made, then the statute bars an assessment and the collection of the tax due. But § 250 (d)
does not apply to the proceeding under par. 14 (a), which
relates to a case in which there is a return with a resulting
assessment, as there was here, and the taxpayer seeks to
reduce the assessed tax by presenting a claim for an abatement of part of it, and to avoid the collection of that part,
pending action on the claim for abatement, by giving a
bond. In this case there was a return and there was an
assessment, but the bond was given well within the five
years after the return, and when the bond was given it required the obligees, if the abatement was not allowed, to
pay interest from the time such tax would have been due,
had no such claim been filed. In other words, the limi-

UNITED STATES v. JOHN BARTH CO.
370

Opinion of the Court.

tation of § 250 (d) has no application to a situation following a claim of abatement and the giving of bond.
The plain purpose of par. 14 (a) was to effect a substitution for the obligation arising under the return and assessment to pay the tax, of the contract entered into in the
bond to pay any part of the tax found to be due upon
the subsequent determination of the Commissioner, and
this with interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per month from
the time the tax would have been due, had no such claim
been filed. Of course, it is not difficult in the somewhat
complicated provisions to suggest, as on behalf of respondent it has been suggested, that some other than the ordinary inference to be given to this set of facts should be
drawn; but the common sense view of the return and the
delay in the payment due after the claim of abatement
and the giving of the bond, is as already stated. The
making of the bond gives the United States a cause of
action separate and distinct from an action to collect taxes
which it already had. The statutes now pleaded to bar
the suit can not be extended by implication to a suit upon
a subsequent and substituted contract. The postponement of the collection of the taxes returned was a waiver
of the statutory limitation of five years that would have
applied had the voluntary return of the taxpayer stood
and no bond been given. If there is any limitation applicable to a suit on the bond, it is conceded that it has not
yet become effective.
Section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42
Stat. 227, 265, repeats the limitation of 1918, adding
thereto "unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer
consent in writing to a later determination, assessment,
and collection of the tax," and like § 250 (d) of the Act
of 1918 has no relevancy or effect here. The Revenue
Act of 1924, § 277 (a) (2), c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, repeats
a similar limitation of five years. Section 1106 (a) of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 113, provides that
the bar of the statute of limitations against the United
States in respect of any internal revenue tax shall not
only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the
liability. This last Act was repealed as of the date of its
enactment. See § 612, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875.
The Government contends that this restores and gives
life to the tax retroactively. It is not necessary for us to
examine this claim, for the reason that the Act of 1926
does not affect, and was not intended to affect, the obligation arising out of the bond. Such bonds are not referred to in the amendments of 1921 or 1924 or 1926, nor
in any way is the taxpayer expressly or impliedly relieved
from such contracts. To avoid the resm usually ensuing
from the return which he himself made, the taxpayer was
permitted by a bond temporarily to postpone the collection and to substitute for his tax liability his contract
under the bond. The object of the bond was not only to
prevent the immediate collection of the tax but also to
prevent the running of time against the Government.
The taxpayer has obtained his object by the use of the
bond, and he should not object to making good the contract by which he obtained the delay he sought.
It is hardly necessary to refer to authority to justify this
conclusion, but it is sustained by United States v. Onken
Brothers, 23 F. (2d) 367; Gray Motor Co. v. United
States, 16 F. (2d) 367; United States v. Rennolds, 27
F. (2d) 902; McCaughn v. PhiladelphiaBarge Co., 27 F.
(2d) 628; United States v. United States Fidelity &
Guaranty Co. 221 Fed. 27; Raymond v. United States,
Fed. Cas. No. 11596.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should
be reversed and the cause remanded for further
proceedings.
Reversed.
