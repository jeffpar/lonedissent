CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 18. Argued October 9, 1928.-Decided February 18, 1929.
1. Under § 14 b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by § 6 of the
Act of June 25, 1910, bankrupts who have obtained goods on
credit upon a written statement that was materially and grossly
incorrect, are not entitled to discharges if they made the statement to the vendor, or acquiesced in its making, for the purpose
of obtaining the credit, with actual knowledge that it was incorrect, or with reckless indifference to the actual facts and with no
reasonable ground to believe that it was correct. Pp. 25, 33.
2. In the absence of concurrent findings by the two lower courts
upon any of the material issues relating to such a written statement, this Court examined the evidence at length for the purpose
of determining the essential facts. P. 27.
3. The rule attaching special weight to findings of a master is inapplicable to a finding which does not depend upon the weighing
of conflicting testimony and credibility of witnesses. P. 33.
21. F. (2d) 161, reversed.

ners trading as Taback Brothers, under an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy filed against them in the District
Court for New Jersey. They seasonably applied for discharge. The firm of Morimura, Arai & Co., an objecting
creditor, filed specifications of opposition on the two
grounds, among others: That the bankrupts had obtained
property on credit on a materIally false statement in
writing made by them to the objecting creditor for the
purpose of obtaining credit; and that with intent to conceal their financial condition they had destroyed, concealed or failed to keep books of account or records from
which such condition might be ascertained. Bankruptcy

ie took the
proof in 1921 and 1922, and in 1926 reported that in his
opinion the bankrupts were entitled to discharge. The
District Judge sustained exceptions to this report and
ordered that the application for discharge be denied. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this order, with directions to dismiss the exceptions and discharge the bankrupts, 21 F. (2d) 161.
The Morimura Company rel'es here on both of the
grounds of opposition mentioned above.
The first of these grounds is predicated on a written
statement made to the Morimura Company in January
1920. This, under § 14b(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, as
amended in 1910, required a denial of the discharge, if
(a) the bankrupts obtained property on credit from the

In the master's report-which is set forth in the margin 8-- he made no specific findings of fact in reference to
the precise issues, but without citing any testimony or
giving his reason, stated generally that he believed the
statement "was substantially correct." The District
Judge-after referring to the vagueness and generality of
this report-stated that obviously the statement was false
and was made for the purpose of obtaining credit. The
Circuit Court of Appeals-after referring to the fact that
3 In this report the master stated: "I beg leave to report that the
objections to the discharge of the bankrupts in this case are predicated largely upon a statement issued by the bankrupts as of December 31st, 1919. The adjudication in this matter was September 29th,
1920, and during the time between the giving of the statement . . .
and the adjudication, . . . the silk business passed through one of
the worst periods in its existence, raw silk declining from around
$15.00 to $4.50 per pound, and I believe the statement issued by the
bankrupts in 1919 was substantially correct. The old books of the
bankrupts were apparently destroyed, but the new books, for considerable time prior to the bankruptcy, had been so far as the records
show, correctly kept. The bankrupts did obtain property on credit,
but not to the extent of the credit that had been extended to them;
they bought a large quantity of raw silk on contract, running into
the several hundred thousand dollars, which was apparently a gamble
between the bankrupts and the creditors as to which one was going
to win, and with the exception of a few discrepancies in the books
which were afterwards explained, it is my opinion that the said bankrupts have in all things conformed to the requirements of (the Bankruptcy Act of 1898); and that the testimony herein and returned
herewith shows that the said bankrupts have committed none of the
offenses and done none of the acts prohibited by said Act, and that,
in my opinion, the said bankrupts, Nathan Taback and Louis
Taback, ind. and as prts. trdg. as Taback Brothers, are entitled to
fheir discharge."

Opinion of the Court.

the master saw and heard all the witnesses-without de-

termining whether or not the statement was correct, stated
that they were not satisfied that "a consciously false
financial statement was made for the purpose of obtaining
credit."
As there is no concurrent finding on any of the material
issues relating to the written statement, we have examined
the evidence at length for the purpose of determining the
essential facts.
Shortly stated, it appears that in 1917 the two Tabacks
entered into the business of buying and selling silk as
partners under the firm name of Taback Brothers. The
capital consisted of borrowed money. The firm carried
on business in New York until May 1920, when it moved
to New Jersey. The business gradually enlarged, and
the firm established a good credit, paying its bills
promptly and frequently taking the cash discounts. It
began to purchase silk from the Morimura Company in
1919. On a financial statement showing that on July 1
the firm had a net worth of $140,000, the Morimura Company in September extended it a line of credit of $20,000,
on terms of sixty days. From that time until January
1, 1920, the firm bought about $150,000 worth of silk from
the Morimura Company, and paid all of its bills before
maturity. However, during that time Nathan Taback,
who had charge of this branch of the firm's business, on
different occasions, applied, both in person and through the
salesman from whom he purchased the silk, to the credit
manager of the Morimura Company for an enlargement
of the line of credit. This the manager refused until he
had a new financial statement on which to base an
increase.
On January 1, 1920, the firm opened a new set of books.
An accountant carried forward to the new books the
entries from the previous books which showed the status
of affairs of the firm on December 31, 1919. The correct-

ness of the old books and of the transfer to the new books
is not questioned. In the opening entries of the new
books the capital of one of the partners was shown as
$4,385.93, and that of the other as $7,285.50, making a
total capital of $11,671.43.
From that time until the bankruptcy the new books
were used by the firm; and they were introduced in evidence. The old books, which were stored in the office
until the firm moved to New Jersey in the following May,
were then cast aside and could not be produced in
evidence.
There was introduced in evidence a tabulated statement
compiled from the opening entries in the new books,
which is set forth in the margin.4 This tabulated statement-the accuracy of which was not questioned-shows
that on January 1, 1920, the total assets of the firm, as
shown by the new books, were $277,846.48, and the total
liabilities $266,175.05, leaving a net worth of $11,671.43the exact amount of the aggregate capital of the two
partners as shown on the books.

MORIMURA v. TABACK.
Opinion of the Court.

24

On January 7, 1920, six days after the new books were
opened, Nathan Taback furnished the credit manager of
the Morimura Company a written statement which he had
prepared and signed, purporting to show the assets and
liabilities of the firm on December 31, 1919. The manager
testified that at that time Nathan Taback requested an
enlargement of the firm's credit, and that, after questioning Taback as to various items in the statement, he agreed
to extend the firm a line of credit of $40,000 on four
months' time. This was denied by Nathan Taback; and
both the bankrupts testified that this statement was
made merely to show how they stood, and that they did
not then need any credit from the Morimura Company.
This statement, which is set forth in the margin,' is
utterly irreconcilable with the financial condition of the

firm as disclosed by the new books opened on January 1.
This appears by a comparison with the tabulated statement compiled from these books." The statement of
January 7 shows on its face total assets of $372,066.03 as
against only $277,846.48 shown by the books; a liability,
of only $96,395.20, by open account, as against total liabilities of $266,175.05 shown by the books; and a net
worth of $275,670.83 as against only $11,671.43 shown by
the books; that is, the statement of January 7 shows
$94,219.55 more of assets and $169,779.85 less of liabilities than those shown by the books; and a net worth of
$263,999.40 more than the net worth shown by the books.
And, as appears by a detailed comparison between the
statement of January 7 and the tabulated statement,
every item in the statement of January 7 is materially different from the corresponding item appearing on the
books.
No evidence whatever was offered by the bankrupts to
account for the discrepancies between the statement of
January 7 and the tabulated statement drawn from the
books. There was no effort to show that the firm had on
December 31, 1919, any assets that were not shown on the
books, or did not owe any of the liabilities shown on

the books. While Nathan Taback stated generally that
the statement of January 7 was correct to the best of his
knowledge, he testified that the accountants who opened
the new books had not then reported to him the financial
condition appearing on the books; and, being asked where
he got his statement, said: "I sat down in the office on 'a
certain day and I looked up the balance sheets in the
bank, both banks, . . . and I looked up my stock, and I
looked up what we had on contract, and what we have
sold to be delivered, January, February and March-we
had at that time $100,000 profits to be made which was
sold to good concerns, and I figured my building so much
worth, and so I wrote out my profit what it was worth on
January 1st, so much for building, and I made up my
statement with my own soul. Q. You didn't compare
your assets and liabilities with the books? A. I followed
my own information of what we had, and my brother
came up from New York and I told him what we took up
as profits, which was not cashed in yet, but I figured I am
worth the money. Q. Where did you get the liabilities
from? A. I looked up the unpaid items and I checked
up and found out what was paid and unpaid, and that is
what I put down, my own figures to my best knowledge.
Q. Did you compare them with the items of liabilities as
appeared on the books? A. Mr. Putney, as far as I had
knowledge of, I tried my best to not give a false statement.
Q. Did you look at your books to see? A. I looked at
the books to see what was owing to us and to see what
we owed, and I took it down to my own best knowledge .....
.Q.
Did you, when you were making this
statement for (the credit manager) look at (the purchase
ledger) book in order to get the amount of the debts which
you owed? A. No." And when asked in reference to
the fact that the statement of January 7 showed that the
liabilities were only $96,395.20 (by accounts payable),
while the general ledger showed "notes payable" alone

of $109,246.18 on January 1, he said: "I took it the way
I explained before, but I didn't touch the books."
Louis Taback, who had charge of the firm's sales and
could not read or write, testified that he did not find out
that a statement had been given to the Morimura Company until about a day or two afterward when his brother
told him he had been up to the Morimura Company and
given a statement of how they stood, and that, as he
understood, "my brother looked up the stock and said it
was worth between $275,000 and $300,000. . . . He figured up what we took in and what we sold and the mill,
and he showed me how much we are worth."
On January 10 the firm contracted with the Morimura
Company for the purchase of twenty bales of silk at a
stipulated price on terms of four months after delivery in
February." In April the Morimura Company delivered
to the firm the twenty bales called for by the contract,
taking in payment two trade acceptances, aggregating
$39,536.19, at four months each. The credit manager of
the Morimura Company testified that the contract and
deliveries were made in reliance upon the statement of
January 7.
In the latter part of January the price of silk began to
fall. This finally resulted in a panic in the silk market,
and the firm became bankrupt in September. Between
January 1 and the bankruptcy it had bought more than
$100,000 worth of silk from the Morimura Company in
addition to the twenty bales of silk mentioned above, and
had also bought a large amount of silk on credit from
other dealers. For some time it paid its bills to the Morimura Company before maturity, and at the time of the
bankruptcy had paid everything due the Morimura Corn7The

pany except the trade acceptances for $39,536.19 given in
April, which were still unpaid.
Upon the entire evidence we reach the following conclusions:
1. The undisputed evidence shows that the written
statement of January 7 was materially and grossly incorrect, purporting as it did to show that the firm had a net
worth of approximately $264,000 more than the actual net
worth shown by its books. The opinion of the master
that this statement was " substantially correct "-the only
specific finding made in his report-manifestly did not
depend upon the weighing of conflicting testimony or the
credibility of witnesses. For this reason, if for no other,
it does not have the weight ordinarily attaching to the
conclusions of a master upon conflicting evidence, as stated
in Tilghman v. Proctor, 125 U. S. 136, 149; and it was
clearly due to error or mistake.
2. It is established by the clear weight of the evidence
that the written statement-which was made to the Morimura Company by Nathan Taback in behalf of the firm
and was acquiesced in by Louis Taback-was not only
incorrect but materially false within the meaning of § 14b
(3) of the Bankruptcy Act; that is, that it was made and
acquiesced in either with actual knowledge that it was
incorrect, or with reckless indifference to the actual facts,
without examining the available source of knowledge
which lay at hand, and with no reasonable ground to
believe that it was in fact correct.
3. It is established by the clear weight of the evidence
that this false statement was made to the Morimum Company for the express purpose of obtaining silk on cred'.t,
and that upon it silk was in fact obtained from the Morimum Company on credit. Compare Gerdes v. Lustgarten, supra.
It follows that the specification of opposition based on
this written
statement should have been sustained, and

the bankrupts' application for discharge should have been

It

is not necessary to determine whether the other

specification of opposition to the application for discharge,
which was predicated upon the books of account or records
kept by the firm after January 1, 1920, should also have

been sustained, since even if this were the case the result
would not be changed.
The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded to

the District Court, with instructions to enter a decree
