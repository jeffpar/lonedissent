Statement of the Case.

DOUGLAS v. NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN & HARTFORD RAILROAD COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, NINTH
DISTRICT.
No. 312. Argued January 16, 1929. Reargued April 15, 16, 1929.Decided May 13, 1929.
1. In determining whether the privileges and immunities clause of
the Constitution, or an Act of Congress, is contravened by a state
statute, the purport established for the state statute by the highest
court of the State is accepted here. P. 385.
2. Where a state law is susceptible of two constructions, one of which
might put it in conflict with the Federal Constitution, it is to be
presumed that the other construction, rendering it valid, would be
adopted by the state courts. P. 386.
3. In § 1780 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure, under which
as locally construed actions by non-residents against foreign corporations doing business in the State are subject to dismissal at the
discretion of the court, the term "non-resident" should be interpreted as embracing citizens of the State who do not actually
live in the State at the time of bringing such actions. P. 386.
4. A state law under which citizens of the State who actually reside
there have the right to maintain actions in the state courts against
foreign corporations doing business there on causes of action arising from foreign torts, but under which such actions when brought
by non-residents, whether citizens of that State or of other States,
are subject to dismissal at the discretion of the court, makes a distinction based on rational considerations and does not violate the
privileges and immunities clause, Art. IV, § 2, of the Constitution.
P. 387.
5. The Federal Employers' Liability Act does not purport to require
state courts to entertain actions under it as against an otherwise
valid excuse under the state law. P. 387.
248 N. Y. 580, affirmed.

brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. See
also 223 App. Div. (N. Y.) 782. The Attorney General of
New York was given leave to file a brief and take part in
the reargument, because of the importance of the case.
Messrs. Thomas J. O'Neill and Charles D. Lewis, with
whom Messrs. John Ambrose Goodwin, Leonard F. Fish,
and L. Daniel Danzigerwere on the brief, for petitioner.
The state statute, as it now reads, is neither in conflict
with natural justice nor the Federal Constitution. The
difficulty is, that New York courts have interpreted it to
mean what the judges privately seem to believe the law
should be, based on principles of state comity, Murnan v.
Wabash R. Co., 246 N. Y. 244, and not according to the
intent of Art. VI of the Federal Constitution in view of
Art. IV, § 2, of that instrument and the rights of residents
of New York to resort to state courts.
It is this conflict that we ask this Court to overrule,
since in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction it is not
bound by the decision of a final state court establishing
state law when that decision makes that which is constitutional unconstitutional within the plain intent of the Federal Constitution. Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, 259 U. S. 503;
Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 385; Southwestern Telephone
Co. v. Danaher,238 U. S. 482; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, 245 U. S. 292.
Great stress has been placed by the New York courts on
the words "may be maintained" as used in § 47. They
have been construed to vest a discretion in the court to
entertain or decline an action. The same words, however,
are used in i§ 46 of the same statute enacted at the same
time, and as to their use in the latter section they have
always been held mandatory. Gregonis v. P. & R. Coal
Co., 204 N. Y. 478. By what legal principle, we ask, do
the same words command obligatory jurisdiction as matter
of right in the case of a resident and give discretionary

DOUGLAS v. NEW HAVEN R. CO.

Argument for Petitioner.

jurisdiction in the case of a non-resident in the same kind
of an action in tort?
The principle of comity, perhaps, justifies certain classes
of discrimination. But this principle has no application
to the present action under our constitutional form of government, Murray v. C. & N. W. R. Co., 62 Fed. 24, since
the present action involves the enforcement of the Federal
Constitution and an Act of Congress, and not the applicability of a statute of a sister State.
This Court has dealt with the use of the word "residents" in LaTourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465.
If New York allows its "residents" the absolute right
to resort to its courts, it must also allow its "citizens"
the same privilege, for "residents" must of necessity,
under our constitutional form of government at least inSection 1, Fourteenth Amendment.
clude "citizens."
To refuse a like absolute right to non-residents, when the
non-resident is a citizen of the United States, of necessity
must violate § 2 of Art. IV of the Federal Constitution.

Congress emphasized its intent to provide that an injured employee of a common carrier railroad might sue
under the Federal Employers' Liability Act either in the
District Court of the United States, or in any state court
of competent jurisdiction in the district of the residence
of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose.

or in which the defendant does business at the time of the
commencement of the action. Congress had the right to
confer this jurisdiction upon the state courts, and the
provisions of its Act are supreme. Matter of Taylor, 232
U. S. 263; Toledo, St. L. & W. R. Co. v. Allen, 276 U. S.
165; Mondou v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., 223 U. S. 1;
Missouri v. Taylor, 266 U. S. 200.
That Congress, when regulating interstate commerce,
may compel the several state courts to take jurisdiction
of civil actions authorized by such legislation, whenever
said "state courts' ordinary jurisdiction, as prescribed by
local laws, is appropriate to the occasion, and is invoked
in conformity with those laws," is too well settled to dispute. Cases supra; U. S. Constitution, Art. I, § 8, Art.
VI; Robb v. Conley, 111 U. S. 637; Tennessee v. Davis,
100 U. S. 257; Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 595; Covell v.

court exists and has jurisdiction, Congress may enforce
the exercise of its jurisdiction. Art. VI; Art. I, § 8, U. S.

Mr. Edward R. Brumley, with whom Messrs. John M.
Gibbons, Frederick J. Rock, and J. Howland Gardner,Jr.,
were on the brief, for respondent.
The order and judgment do not violate § 2 of Article IV
of the Constitution of the United States.
Both § 46 and § 47 of the General Corporation Law of
New York contain the word "may," but the opinion in
"Gregonis v. P. & R. Coal Co., 235 N. Y. 152, says that the
courts have never refused to entertain jurisdiction over a
foreign corporation in behalf of a resident for a transitory
cause of action such as contract and tort cases arising outside of the State. This is somewhat negatived by Pietraroiav. N. J. & H. R. R. & F. Co., 197 N. Y. 434, but is in

line with Palmer v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 84 N. Y. 63; Grant
v. Cananea Copper Co., 189 N. Y. 241; and McCauley v.
Georgia Bank, 239 N. Y. 514.
While there is no statutory or constitutional reason, we
submit, why this should be so, this is the situation as it
obtains in New York State at the present time. The opinion in Gregonis v. P. & R. Coal Co., supra, admits rejection of litigation even by residents where it is futile and
useless to assume jurisdiction. There is some indication
that if plaintiff had been a citizen, jurisdiction would be
compulsory, but this is dictum, and throughout emphasis
is laid upon residence. A further limitation of the broad
ruling of Gregonis v. P. & R. Coal Co., supra, is made in
Swift & Co. v. Obcanska Zalozna V. Karline, 245 N. Y.

The so-called discrimination is not between citizens and
non-citizens, but between residents and non-residents.

Johnson v. Victoria Copper Co., 150 App. Div. 653.
It has been the unanimous opinion of the Court of
Appeals that § 1780 of the Code did not conflict with any
provision of the Federal Constitution or with the federal
authorities upon the subject. Grant v. Cananea Copper

Conveniens in Anglo-American Law, Columbia L. R., Vol.

The Fourteenth Amendment does not make a resident
in a State a citizen of such State unless he intends by residence therein to become a citizen. Sharon v. Hill, 26 Fed.
337; Penfield v. C. & 0. R. Co., 134 U. S. 351.
A discrimination is not unconstitutional, even as between citizens of different States, if there is a reasonable
ground for the diversity of treatment. The constitutional
question does not arise in this case because of the circumstances.
The cause of action did not arise in New York out of
business done by the defendant therein. The immaterial
fact that the defendant was doing some business in New
York can hardly serve as the basis for the invocation by
petitioner of a constitutional privilege. The discrimination is not directed against plaintiff because he is a nonresident. Non-residents are capable of separate identification from residents by facts and circumstances other
than that they are non-residents. This goes further than
is required for permissive classification. Central Loan &
Trust Co. v. Campbell, 173 U. S. 84.
LaTourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465, is authority for
the proposition that the discrimination under the New
York statute is not between citizens and non-citizens, but
between residents and non-residents. But the case is also
authority for the proposition that discrimination may be
made if we have "practical justifications." Cf. Minor v.
Happersett, 21 Wall. 162; Chemung Canal Bank v.
Lowery, 93 U. S. 72; McCready v. Virginia,94 U. S. 391;

" Literal and precise equality in respect of this matter
is not attainable; it is not required." Hess v. Pawlowski,
274 U. S. 352, at p. 356.
New York's judicial policy in the treatment of nonresidents is reasonable.
To exercise discretionary jurisdiction has become a
matter of public policy. Payne v. N. Y., S. & W. R. Co.,
157 App. Div. 302; Colorado State Bank v. Gallagher,76
Hun. 310; Collard v. Beach, 81 App. Div. 582.
Only in tort cases, arising outside of New York, between non-residents, do New York courts make it a rule
to exercise a reasonable discretion, based upon all the
circumstances. Mere non-residence is never controlling.
Because of non-residence, other circumstances may come
in making reasonable the refusal of jurisdiction.
Because the exercise of jurisdiction would be a burden
on interestate commerce, the refusal to exercise jurisdiction is at least reasonable, and, therefore, not a violation
of § 2 of Art. IV of the Constitution.
For general treatment of this subject matter see Yale
L. J., V. XXXVII, p. 983; Harvard L. R., V. XLI, p.
387; Columbia L. R., V. XXIX, p. 1.
The courts of New York are invested with discretion
to decline jurisdiction of an action under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act such as this one. Douglas v.
N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., 246 N. Y. 422.
Congress has not attempted to enlarge state jurisdiction
by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. In the first
place, this is indicated by the wording of the statute
itself.

384

Argument for Respondent.

279 U. S.

In the second place, the effect of the use of the word
"concurrent" is analogous to its use in the Eighteenth
Amendment of the Constitution. It does not mean joint
jurisdiction any more than "concurrent power" in the
Eighteenth Amendment means joint power. National
Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350. . Furthermore, neither
the statute nor the Amendment is the "source of the power
of the States." United States v. Lanza, 260 U. S. 377;
Hebert v. Louisiana,272 U. S. 312.
In the third place, in the Act we find the words "competent jurisdiction," referring to the state courts. Manifestly Congress intended not to enlarge state jurisdiction,
for otherwise the phrasing would be totally unnecessary.
The decisions of this and of other courts bear out this
statutory interpretation. Chambers v. B. & 0. R. Co., 207
U. S. 142; Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1;
Walton v. Pryor,276 Ill. 563, s. c. 245 U. S. 675; Loftus v.
Pennsylvania R. Co., 107 Oh. St. 352, s. c. 266 U. S. 639.
Congress can not enlarge state jurisdiction. Martin v.
Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304; Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1;
Rushworth v. Judge, 58 N. J. L. 97; Murnan v. Wabash R.
Co., 246 N. Y. 244.
But this Act does not impose jurisdiction except upon
the federal courts. The laws of the State must determine
whether "the State has cognizance of the cause of action
and may acquire jurisdiction of the parties." Trapp v.
B. & 0. R. Co., 283 Fed. 655. Each State decides for itself the jurisdictional limitations of its courts.
A State may refuse to entertain jurisdiction, notwithstanding the effect is to exclude an action under a federal
statute. Walton v. Pryor, supra;Anglo-American Co. v.
Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373. New York, having
concurrent jurisdiction, is "free to adopt such remedies,
and to attach to them such incidents as it sees fit." Red

MR. JusTici
Court.

HoLmES delivered the opinion of the

This is a suit under the Employers' Liability Act for
personal injuries. The injuries were inflicted in Connecticut, the plaintiff, the petitioner, is a citizen and
resident of Connecticut, and the defendant, the respondent, is a Connecticut corporation, although doing business in New York where the suit was brought. Upon
motion the trial Court dismissed the action, assuming
that the statutes of the State gave it a discretion in the
matter, and its action was affirmed by the Appellate Division, 223 App. Div. 782, and by the Court of Appeals,
248 N. Y. 580. Thus it is established that the statute
purports to give to the Court the power that it exercised.
But the plaintiff says that the Act as construed is void
under Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution of the
United States: "The Citizens of each State shall be
entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in
the several States." A subordinate argument is added
that the jurisdiction is imposed by the Employers' Liability Act when as here the Court has authority to entertain the suit. C., Title 45, § 56. Acts of April 22,
1908, c. 149, ' 6, 35 Stat. 66, April 5, 1910, c. 143, § 1, 36
Stat. 291. That section gives concurrent jurisdiction to
the Courts of the United States and the States and forbids removal if the suit is brought in a State court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

The language of the New York statute, Laws of 1913,
c. 60, amending § 1780 of the Code of Civil Procedure
is: "An action against a foreign corporation may ibe
maintained by another foreign corporation, or by a nonresident, in one of the following cases only; . . . 4.
When a foreign corporation is doing business within this
State." Laws of 1920, c. 916, § 47. The argument for
the petitioner is that, construed as it is, it makes a discrimination between citizens of New York and citizens of
other States, because it authorizeg the Court in its discretion to dismiss an action by a citizen of another State but
not an action brought by a citizen of New York, which
last it cannot do. Gregonis v. Philadelphia& Reading
Coal & Iron Co. 235 N. Y. 152. It is said that a citizen
of New York is a resident of New York wherever he
may be living in fact, and thus that all citizens of
New York can bring these actions, whereas citizens of
other States can not unless they are actually living in the
State. But however often the word resident may have
been used as equivalent to citizen, and for whatever purposes residence may have been assumed to follow citizenship, there is nothing to prohibit the legislature from
using 'resident' in the strict primary sense of one actually living in the place for the time, irrespective even of
domicile. If that word in this statute must be so construed in order to uphold the act or even to avoid
serious doubts of its constitutionality, we presume that
the Courts of New York would construe it in that way;
as indeed the Supreme Court has done already in so many
words. Adams v. Penn Bank of Pittsburgh,35 Hun. 393.
Duquesne Club v. Penn Bank of Pittsburgh,35 Hun. 390.
Robinson v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 112 N. Y.
315, 324. Klotz v. Angle, 220 N. Y. 347, 358. See
CanadianNorthern Ry. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562,
563. The same meaning seems to be assumed in Gregonis

Opinion of the Court.

v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 235 N. Y.
152. We cannot presume, against this evidence and in
order to overthrow a statute, that the Courts of New
York would adopt a different rule from that which is well
settled here. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S.
375, 390.
Construed as it has been, and we believe will be construed, the statute applies to citizens of New York as well
as to others and puts them on the same footing. There
is no discrimination between citizens as such, and none
between non-residents with regard to these foreign causes
of action. A distinction of privileges according to residence may be based upon rational considerations and
has been upheld by this Court, emphasizing the difference between citizenship and residence, in La Tourette
v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. Followed in Maxwell v.
Bugbee, 250 U. S. 525, 539. It is true that in Blake v.
McClung, 172 U. S. 239, 247, 'residents' was taken to
mean citizens in a Tennessee statute of a wholly different
scope, but whatever else may be said of the argument in
that opinion (compare p. 262, ibid.) it cannot prevail
over the later decision in La Tourette v. McM aster, and
the plain intimations of the New York cases to which
we have referred. There are manifest reasons for preferring residents in access to often overcrowded Courts,
both in convenience and in the fact that broadly speaking it is they who pay for maintaining the Courts concerned.
As to the grant of jurisdiction in the Employers' Liability Act, that statute does not purport to require State
Courts to entertain suits arising under it, but only to
empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the
United States is concerned. It may very well be that if
the Supreme Court of New York were given no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would be subject to a

SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 559.

Argued April 24, 1929.-Decided May 13, 1929.

1. An undisclosed invention does not need a patent to protect it from
disclosure by breach of trust. P. 391.
2. 0, being the inventor of a machine, employed B as a machinist to
construct it, B agreeing to keep secret the information concerning
the invention imparted to him by 0 and not to make use of it for
the benefit of himself or any other than 0. B, in breach of his trust,
surreptitiously obtained a patent for the invention as his own, and
0, in a suit in a state court, obtained a decree holding B a trustee
ex maleficio of the invention and patent, commanding him to assign
the patent to 0 and forbidding him to use, make or sell, etc., such
machines or to transfer any rights under the patent. Held:
(1) That the suit was not one arising under the patent laws and
was within the jurisdiction of the state court. P. 390.
(2) That the decree of the state court was an estoppel against B
in a suit brought by him in the federal court to enjoin 0 from infringing the patent. P. 391.
