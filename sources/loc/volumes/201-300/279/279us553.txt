Argument for Respondent.

279 U. S.

The appeal was within the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeals. Sec. 226, Code of Law for the District of Columbia; Gilbert v. Endowment Ass'n, 10 App. D. C. 316;
s. c., 15 App. D. C. 40.
The appeal was not from a final decree in a suit in
which the United States was complainant, but from an
order denying leave to a third party to intervene in a suit
in which the United States was complainant.
For the purpose of the appeal, the order was sufficiently
final as to the Canneries to sustain the appeal to the Court
of Appeals under ยง 226 of the Code, but not to sustain a
direct appeal to this Court under the Expediting Act.
Voorhees v. IndianapolisCar Co., 140 Ind. 220. Distinguishing Stich v. Dickinson, 38 Cal. 608; People v. Pfeiffer, 59 Cal. 89; Henry v. Travelers Ins. Co., 16 Colo. 179;
and Harmon v. Bashydt, 20 Neb. 625.
The respondent was not a party to the anti-trust suit
wherein the United States was complainant and could not
appeal therein. Voorhees v. Indianapolis Car Co., supra;

104 U. S. 578; In re Leaf Tobacco, 222 U. S. 578.
The final decree appealable to this Court under the
Expediting Act must dispose of the merits of the case
wherein the United States is complainant. Arnold v.
United States, 263 U. S. 427; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.
v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 215 U. S. 216; Rudolph

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case is a sequel to Swift & Co. v. United States, 276
U. S. 311, decided March 19, 1928. It is here by a writ of
certiorari for the determination of a question which arose
upon the going down of the mandate in the Swift case.
The suit was commenced by the Government in the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on February
27, 1920, against the leading packers to prevent a long
feared monopoly in meat and other food products. On
that day a consent decree was entered. Nearly five years
later, two of the defendants, Swift & Co. and Armour &
Co., filed in the cause motions to vacate that decree.
From the denial of those motions appeals were taken to
the Court of Appeals for the District. That court certified questions to us. We ordered the entire record sent
here; and then held that, because the Expediting Act
of February 11, 1903, c. 544, ยง 2, 32 Stat. 823, provides for
a direct appeal to this Court in suits in equity brought
by the United States under the Anti-Trust Act, the Court
of Appeals was without jurisdiction. We also held that
the Supreme Court of the District had jurisdiction of the
subject matter and of the parties; and that the consent decree entered by it was in all respects valid and enforceable.
Its order denying the motions to vacate the consent decree was, therefore, affirmed.
An obstacle to the enforcement of the consent decree
remains. An order of the Supreme Court of the District,
entered May 1, 1925, suspends the operation of the consent decree as a whole " until further order of the court to
be made, if at all, after a full hearing on the merits according to the usual course of chancery proceedings."
That order (as we know judicially from our own records,
Aspen Mining & Snwlting Co. v. Billings, 150 U. S. 31,
38) was made upon motion of the California Coperative

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

Canneries, which, long after the entry of the consent decree was allowed to intervene under the following circumstances.
On April 29, 1922, the Canneries made a motion for
leave to file an intervening petition. The petition accompanying the motion alleged that the consent decree interferes with the performance by Armour & Co. of a contract
theretofore made with it, by which Armour agreed to buy
large quantities of California canned fruit. The petition
charged that the decree is void because the Supreme
Court of the District lacked jurisdiction; and it prayed
that the decree be vacated. The Supreme Court denied
leave to intervene. The Canneries appealed to the Court
of Appeals. That court, so far as appears, did not consider the question whether, in view of the Expediting Act,
it had jurisdiction on appeal. It did not refer to the decisions whichhold that an order denying leave to intervene is not appealable, In re Cutting,94 U. S. 15; Credits
Commutation Co. v. United States, 177 U. S. 311; Ex
parte Leaf Tobacco Board of Trade, 222 U. S. 578, 581;
In re Engelhard,231 U. S. 646; City of New York v. Consolidated Gas Co., 253 U. S. 219; New York v. New York
Telephone Co., 261 U. S. 312, except where he who seeks
to intervene has a direct and immediate interest in a res
which is the~subject of the suit, compare Frenchv. Gapen,
105 U. S. '509, 524-526; Smith v. Gale, 144 U. S. 509;
Leary v. United States, 224 U. S. 567; Swift v. Black Panther Oil & Gas Co., 244 Fed. 20, 30. Nor did it refer
to the settled rule of practice that intervention will not
be allowed for the purpose of impeaching a decree already
made.1 On June 2, 1924, it reversed the order of the
I See Forbes v. Railroad, Fed. Gas. No. 4,926; Coffin v. Chatfanooga Water & Power Co., 44 Fed. 533; Lombard Investment Co. v.
Seaboard Mfg. Co., 74 Fed. 325, 327; Land Title & Trust Co. V.
Asphalt Co. of America, 114 Fed. 484; State Trust Co. v. Kansas City,
etc. Co, 120 Fed. 398, 407-408. This rule of practice is embodied in

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court; directed that leave to intervene be
granted; and ordered "that such further proceedings
thereupon be had as are necessary to determine the issue
raised." California Codperative Canneries v. United
States, 299 Fed. 908. No such proceedings were ever
taken.
So far as appears, the Supreme Court of the District
has not been requested by the Government since our decision in the Swift case, to rescind the order of suspension.
Instead the Government, upon the coming down of our
mandate, moved in the Court of Appeals that its judgment
of June 2, 1924, directing that the Canneries have leave
to intervene and ordering further proceedings, be vacated.
That motion the Court of Appeals denied without either
an opinion or a statement of any reason therefor. This
writ of certiorari was then granted to review its refusal.
278 U. S. 592. In support of the refusal, the Canneries
contends that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the
appeal from the order denying leave to intervene. It
argues that the appeal was not within the purview of ยง 2
of the Expediting Act,' because it was not "an appeal from
the final decree "; because the Caniieries was not at the
Equity Rule 37. See Hutchinson v. Philadelphia & G. S. S. Co., 216
Ped. 795; Hopkins v. Lancaster, 254 Fed. 190; Cauffiel v. Lawrence,
256 Fed. 714; King v. Barr, 262 Fed. 56; Mueller v. Adler, 292 Fed.

Section 2. "That in every suit in equity pending or hereafter
brought in any circuit [district] court of the United States under
[the Anti-Trust Act], wherein the United States is complainant, . . an appeal from the final decree of the circuit [district]
court will lie only to the Supreme Court and must be taken within
sixty days from the entry thereof.

time of its appeal a party to a suit in which the United
States was the "complainant "; and because, under ยง 226
of the District of Columbia Code, the Court of Appeals
has, in its discretion, jurisdiction of an appeal from interlocutory orders. The contention is unsound.
Congress sought by the Expediting Act to ensure speedy
disposition of suits in equity brought by the United States
under the Anti-Trust Act. Before the passage of the Expediting Act the opportunities for delay were many.
From a final decree in the trial court under the Anti-Trust
Act an appeal lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and six
months were allowed for taking the appeal. From the
jujdgment of the Court of Appeals an appeal lay to this
Court; and one year was allowed for taking that appeal.
Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, ยงยง 6, 11, 26 Stat. 826, 828,
829. See United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 60 Fed. 306;
60 Fed. 934; 156 U. S. 1; United States v. Trans-Missouri
Freight Association, 53 Fed. 440; 58 Fed. 58; 166 U. S.
290. Moreover, there might be an appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals from a decree granting or denying an
interlocutory injunction, Act of June 6, 1900, c. 803, 31
Stat. 660. These provisions governing appeals in general
were amended by the Expediting Act so that in suits in
equity under the Anti-Trust Act "in which the United
States is complainant," the appeal should be direct to this
Court from the final decree in the trial court. Thus, Congress limited the right of review to an appeal from the
decree which disposed of all matters, see Collins v. Miller,
252 U. S.364; and it precluded 'the possibility of an appeal
to either court from an interlocutory decree. The time
for taking the appeal from the final decree was shortened
to sixty days.
For the enforcement of the Anti-Trust Act within the
District of Columbia, its Supreme Court has jurisdiction

Opinion of .the Court.

corresponding to that which is exercised by the federal
district courts in the several distr'cts; and the appellate
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals of the District corresponds to that of the several Circuit Courts of Appeals.
Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, 274 U. S.
145. In suits in equity brought by the United States
under the Anti-Trust Act, an appeal by one who was permitted to intervene, like an appeal by one of the original
parties, must be taken direct to this Court. Continental
Insurance Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 156. Compare
Buckeye Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 269 U. S. 42, 48.
The purpose of Congress to expedite such suits would
obviously be defeated if in the District of Columbia an
appeal lay to the Court of Appeals from a denial of a
motion for leave to intervene. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25, 38-39. Even
under the Act of 1891, c. 517, in cases where the appeal
was taken direct to this Court from the final decree in the
trial court, every appeal thereafter taken in the cause was
necessarily also to this Court. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v.
St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 249 U. S. 134, 140-142;
St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Hasty, 255
U. S. 252, 254. Compare St. Louis, Iron Mountain &
Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, 244 U. S. 368.
The order of the Supreme Court of the District suspending the enforcement of the consent decree was made
pursuant to the judgment of the Court of Appeals of
June 2, 1924. When our opinion in the Swift case settled
that by reason of the Expediting Act the Court of Appeals
was without jurisdiction of an appeal in a suit in equity
under the Anti-Trust Act in which the United States is
the complainant and that the consent decree is valid, all
obstacles to the enforcement of the consent decree should
have been promptly removed. In refusing to vacate its

v. ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION
ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.
No. 568. Argued April 24, 25, 1929.-Decided May 20, 1929.
Where a carrier, having discontinued some of its interstate trains
without first applying to the state commission, under Ala. Code
(1923) ยง 9713, for permission to abandon the intrastate service
which they had furnished, applied to the federal court for an injunction against infliction of heavy penalties prescribed by the
statute, claiming that to deny the right to discontinue without
such permission would violate the commerce clause of the Constitution and that to require reinstatement of the service without prior
hearing would violate due process; and where the admitted facts
made it clear that no constitutional right would have been impaired or serious financial loss incurred by applying first to the
commission and that there had been no emergency requiring
immediate action, Held:
1. That the carrier should not have discontinued the intrastate
service without applying to the commission for permission. P. 563.
2. That its discontinuance of the intrastate service without such
application does not justify exposing it and its officers and employees to the statutory penalties. Id.
3. The Commission should give the carrier an opportunity to
present facts and, if the application is made promptly, should
determine the matter without subjecting the carrier to any prejudice because of its failure to apply earlier. Id.
4. To this end a decree denying a preliminary injunction should
be vacated and a restraining order be kept in force, leaving the
