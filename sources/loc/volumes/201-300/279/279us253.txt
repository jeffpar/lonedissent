which they operate by exempting them from the payment of a tax of general application, which is neither
aimed at nor discriminates against interstate commerce.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 8. Argued February 23, 24, 1929-Decided April 8, 1929.
1. An order of the President, under the Lever Act, fixing a maximum
price on coal during the late war, when the railroads were under
government control and when there was need of such price regulation in the interest of national safety, was a valid exercise of the
power of the Government and not a violation of the Fifth Amend-

ment, as applied to one selling coal to a manufacturer of railroad
snow-plows, the coal being liable in the circumstances to expropriation by the Government, and the price fixed being such as to afford
the just compensation safeguarded by that amendment. Pp. 258,262.
2. Congress may regulate the making and performance of private
contracts when reasonably necessary to effect any of the great purposes for which the National Government was created. P. 261.
3. Congress and the President, in the exercise of the war power, have
wide discretion as to the means to be employed; and the measures
here challenged are supported by a strong presumption of validity
and may not be set aside unless clearly shown to be arbitrary and
repugnant to the Constitution. P. 261.

CERTIORARI,

274 U. S. 731, to review a judgment of the

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania sustaining a judgment
for the defendant-the present respondent-in petitioner's action for a balance alleged to be due on sales of coal.
The judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Superior Court, 87 Pa. Superior Ct. 237, which was affirmed,
in turn, by the court below.
Mr. Ira Jewell Williams, with whom Messrs. Ira Jewell
Williams, Jr., Lisle D. McCall, and Fr1ancis Shunk Brown
were on the brief, for petitioner.
The exercise of the war powers is subject to the Fifth
Amendment. United States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623;
Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U. S. 155;
United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81.
Congress has no power to fix the price of coal. Where
no right to regulate exists, there can be no burden to show
that the regulation is confiscatory. To forbid a seller to
sell at prices which the buyer is willing and eager to pay,
is confiscation. Price-fix'ng is necessarily arbitrary and
unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional. The very purpose of price-fixing by giving authority to fix a maximum
price is to keep the owner of property from selling it for
as much as it will bring. If this is done as a measure of

Argument for Petitioner.

self-protection in wartime and for general governmental
purposes, then obviously the nation at large, i. e., the
Government, should bear the burden, not the particular
industry or person affected. The act of the Government
has resulted in a deprivation of the right and power to
dispose of one's property for what it will bring. Then
the deprivation is really for a public purpose. But, as
this Court has held, it is not a taking for a public use.
Morrisdale Coal Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 188; Pine
Hill Coal Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 191. The coalmining business is not affected by a general public interest.

273 U. S. 418.
There was no emergency. If there were only-so much
coal above ground and if it were impossible to continue
mining operations and the coal were being hoarded and
were needed not only for the use of the Army and Navy,
but to protect the lives and health of the citizens, then,
if one could permit so fantastic a play of the imagination,
an "emergency" might be said to exist. Wilson v. New,
243 U. S. 332.
If there is power to fix the prices of commodities, there
is power to fix wages. This is the reductio ad absurdum
of the argument for the power; just as, if there is a power
to fix a minimum wage, then there is the power to fix a
maximum wage.
The basis of "cost plus a reasonable profit" was arbitrary, oppressive and not due process. United State&v.
New River "CollieriesCo., 262 U. S. 341.
In any aspect, price-fixing is an attempted exercise of
legislative power, and the general delegation of such
power, uncharted save by "cost plus a reasonable profit,"
is a complete abdication by Congress and hence void.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner sued respondent in the court of common
pleas of Clearfield county, Pennsylvania, to recover a balance of $830.80 alleged to be due on account of coal sold
between October 17, 1917, and February 15, 1918.
The complaint shows the following facts. October 2,
1917, plaintiff wrote defendant that he had purchased the
output of certain mines and offered coal at $3.60 per ton.
Defendant answered that it wanted a carload per week
until further notice. Plaintiff replied that he had entered
defendant's order for that amount. November 14, after
plaintiff had shipped some of the coal, he wrote defendant that, owing to a recent wage agreement made between
the miners and operators, the cost of mining had been
increased 45 cents per ton; that plaintiff was obliged to
pay the additional cost to the producer, and that he was
making a price until further notice of $4.05 per ton. He
added: "Unless I hear from you to the contrary I shall
take it for granted that you wish me to continue shipments
on your order at this new price." The amount sued for
was based on $3.60 per ton for coal shipped in October and
$4.05 per ton for that delivered later. Defendant had
paid $1,531.84.
The affidavit of defense admitted the sale and delivery
of the coal, denied any agreement as to price; and, among

279 U. S.

other averments not here material, alleged that the United
States had fixed the prices of the coal and that its value
on that basis was $1,322.74.
The trial court held that the plaintiff was bound by the
prices fixed by the Government; and, notwithstanding a
verdict for the plaintiff, gave defendant judgment, which
was affirmed by the superior court and also in the supreme
court of the State.
The prices so held 'applicable were fixed by the President pursuant to § 25 of the Lever Act approved August
10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 284. An executive order of
August 21 specified $2.00 per ton on board cars at the
mine; and an order made October 27 added 45 cents per
ton.
Plaintiff here insists, as he maintained in the state
courts, that Congress had no power to establish or to
authorize the President to prescribe prices for coal without
providing just compensation for those who, in the absence
of such regulation, might have sold their coal for more.
And he contends that, in violation of the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Act and orders operate to deprive him of liberty of contract. His coal was
not requisitioned for public use. He does not claim that
the amount paid by defendant was not compensatory or
that it did not give him a reasonable profit or that the
value of the coal was greater than the prices fixed by the
President. The sole question is whether plaintiff's constitutional rights were infringed by the enforcement of
the Act and orders to prevent him from selling his coal
for prices in excess of the just compensation he would
have been entitled to receive if it had been taken under
the sovereign power of eminent domain.
Long before this country became involved in the war,
Congress adopted measures for the national defense, and
promptly after it entered the conflict there were developed

Opinion of the Court.

comprehensive plans for immediate and effective use of
military force. An Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166,
authorized the enlargement, equipment and training of
the army. An Act of August 29 following, 39 Stat. 619,
645, empowered the President in time of war to take and
utilize systems of transportation for the movement of
troops, war material and other purposes; and, December
26, 1917, the President did take over the railroads of the
country. 40 Stat. 1733. The Joint Resolution of April
6, 1917, 40 Stat. 1, declaring war with Germany directed
the President to employ the entire naval and military
forces and pledged all the resources of the country to bring
the conflict to a successful termination. An act of June
15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182, authorized the President extensively to exert the power of eminent domain in aid of
construction and acquisition of ships.
The Lever Act was broader than its predecessors. It
was passed to encourage production, conserve supply and
control distribution of foods, fuel and many other things
deemed necessary to carry on the war. Hoarding, waste,
and manipulations for the enhancement of prices were
condemned. The President was empowered to license
and regulate production, prices and sales; to requisition
coal and other necessaries, to purchase and sell wheat,
flour and other staple articles of food, and to take over
and operate factories and mines. Section 25 empowered
the President to fix the price of coal, to regulate distribution among dealers and consumers, domestic or foreign,
and to require producers to sell only to the United States
through a designated agency empowered to regulate resale
prices. The basis prescribed for the determination of
prices to be charged by producers of coal was the cost of
production, including the expense of operation, maintenance, depreciation and depletion plus a just and reasonable profit. And prices to be charged by dealers were

260

Opinion of the Cour

279 U.S.

to be made by adding to their cost a just and reasonable
sum for profit. The Act did not require producers or
dealers to sell their coal. It provided for the ascertainment and contemplated the payment of just compensation
for all property that. it authorized the President to take.
During 1916 and the early months of 1917, the mining
and distribution of coal had been greatly disturbed by
conditions resulting from the war abroad and the preparations for national defense being made in this country.
There was panic among consumers; and, in order to secure
adequate supply, they offered prices higher than any
theretofore prevailing. The prices of coal for immediate
delivery, which previously had been from $1.50 to $2.00,
were bid up to $5.00, $6.00, and in exceptional cases as
high as $7.50 per ton. In April contracts for the year's
delivery could be made only at prices ranging from $3.00
up to $5.00 or $6.00 per ton. In May of that year the
Council of National Defense created a committee to deal
with the situation. After prolonged negotiation with producers throughout the country an agreement was reached
by which a tentative maximum price was fixed at $3.00 per
ton at the mines, to which was added twenty-five cents for,
selling commission to wholesalers. The purpose was to
fix a price high enough to stimulate production so that
by the operation of the law of supply and demand fair
and just prices would result. Final Report of United
States Fuel Administrator, p. 20. Report of Engineers
Committee 1918-1919, p. 1.
But this arrangement having failed to give assurance
of an adequate supply, Congress and the President found
it necessary to take the steps here involved. Defendant
was engaged in manufacturing snowplows for railroads.
Unquestionably, the production of such equipment was in
the state of war then prevailing a public use for which coal
and other private property might have been taken by
exertion of the power of eminent domain. When regard

Opinion of the Court.

is had to the condition of the coal industry, plaintiff's
control of the product of the mines referred to in his letters
and the tone of his price quotations support the view
that, in the interest of national safety, there was need of
regulation in order to prevent manipulations to enhance
prices by those having coal for sale and to lessen apprehension on the part of consumers in respect of their supply
and the prices liable to be exacted.
It is everywhere recognized that the freedom of the
people to enter into and carry out contracts in respect of
their property and private affairs is a matter of great
public concern and that such liberty may not lightly be
impaired. Steele v. Drummond, 275 U. S. 199, 205.

process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

the President exert the war power of the nation, and they
have wide discretion as to the means to be employed successfully to carry on. Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S. 243,
248. United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U. S.
1, 10. The measures here challenged are supported by a
strong presumption of validity, and they may not be set
aside unless clearly shown to be arbitrary and repugnant
to the Constitution. Adkins v. ChildrensHospital, supra,
544. The principal purpose of the Lever Act was to
enable the President to provide food, fuel and other
things necessary to prosecute the war without exposing
the government to unreasonable exactions. The authorization of the President to prescribe prices and also to
requisition mines and their output made it manifest that,
if adequate supplies of coal at just prices could not be
obtained by negotiation and price regulation, expropriation would follow. Plaintiff was free to keep his coal, but
it would have been liable to seizure by the government.
The fixing of just prices was calculated to serve the convenience of producers and dealers as well as of consumers
of coal needed to carry on the war. As it does not appear
that plaintiff would have been entitled to more if his coal
had been requisitioned, the Act and orders will be deemed
to have deprived him only of the right or opportunity by
negotiation to obtain more than his coal was worth. Such
an exaction would have increased the cost of the snowplows and other railroad equipment being manufactured
by the defendant and therefore would have been directly
opposed to the interest of the government. As applied
to the coal in question, the statute and executive orders
were not so clearly unreasonable and arbitrary as to require them to be held repugnant to the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment.
Judgment Affirmed.
