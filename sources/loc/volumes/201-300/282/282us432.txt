of supervision and control of -the processes of enforcement. It cannot be deemed to be unreasonable that the
Congress in the present instance provided for cases in
which a'claim in abatement had been filed and the collection stayed. In its selection the Congress dealt *ith
an appropriate class and was not bound to include others.
Nor is the statute rendered invalid by the provision as to
payments made within a year after its enactment. As
already stated, the Treasury Department did not construe
section 611 as authorizing collections in the future, after
the expiration of the period of limitation;'II and if the
Congress saw fit to make the statute applicable to future
voluntary payments, it was clearly entitled to fix a limit
of time within which it might be so applied.
In some of. the cases under review, it is insisted that
section 611 does not preclude the recovery of interest,
upon the ground that the interest had not been assessed
and therefore lay outside -the prohibition -of the statute.
But it does not appear that there was any statutory
requirement that interest as such should be assessed, and
the valid denial of the right to recover the principal should
be deemed to apply also to the interest,

JUSTICE RUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The petitioner fied his income tax return for 1916 in
February, 1917. In October, 1921, the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue assessed an additional tax, and in
November, 1921, the petitioner filed a claim in abatement. In 1924, the Commissioner allowed the claim in
abatement for a portion of the amount claimed and rejected it as to the residue, which the petitioner then paid,
upon the collector's demand.' In December, 1927, the
petitioner filed a claim for refund, which was rejected,
whereupon this suit was brought in the Court of Claims
in December, 1928, to recover the amount pid. The
court dismissed the action, applying section 611 of the
Revenue Act of 1928 (c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875), 37 Fed.
(2d) 763. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, 281
U. S. 713.
, The questions presented with respect to the construction and validity of section 611 are the same as those
considered in Grahamv. GoodCell, ante, p. 409. The petitioner contends, however, that this section does not apply
to his case upon the ground that the tax was not assessed
within the three-year period of limitation prescribed by

section 9 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463, 39 Stat.
756, 763). The Court of Claims held that, the assessment
was valid under the provisions of section 250 (d) of the
Act of 1921 (Act of November 23, 1921, c! 136, 42 Stat.
227, 265). We think the court was right in construing
this statute as applicable to the assessment, although previously made, and hence that the tax was assessed
"within the period of limitation properly.,-applicable
thereto," as required by section 611 of the Revenue Act
of 1928.
The petitioner also insists that his claim in abatement
was illegal under section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1921. We do not find that there was any statutory prohibition of the filing of a claim in abatement in the circumstances here shown. The taxpayer benefited by the
claim and is not in a position to contest its legality.
Compare United States v. The John Barth Company, 279
-U. S.370, 376; lorsheim Brothers Dry Goods Company,
Limited, v.' United States, 280 U. S. 453, 464. The case
falls within section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 and
this precludes recovery.
