Collector of Internal Revenue.
Under the laws and judicial decisions of the State of
Louisiana, the husband's interest in the community income is such that he should properly be required to report
the entire amount in his return; the wife's interest is not
such that she should be permitted to report one-half of
the community income in her return. Citing numerous

MR. JUSU[CE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question presented in this case is the same as that
dealt with inPoe v. Seaborn,ante, p. 101, Goodellv. Koch,
ante, p. 118, and Hopkins v. Bacon, ante,p. 122. The only
variant is that here we are concerned with the community
property law of Louisiana. The case comes here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed (38 Fed. (2d) 649) a judgment of the District
Court (38 Fed. (2d) 642) in favor of the respondent,
whereby respondent recovered the amount of an additional
assessment paid under protest. As in the other cases the
Commissioner made this additional assessment on the
theory that under the law of Louisiana the- whole
community income is to-be treated as the income of the
husband.

BENDER v. PFAIF.
127

Opinion of the Court.

If the test be, as we have held it ii, ownership of the
community income, this case is probably the strongest
of those presented to us, in favor of the wife's ownership
of one-half of that income. The relevant statutes of
Louisiana are noted in the margin.* So called "common
property" includes all property acquired in any manner
by husband and wife during marriage except donations
made to one of the spouses, and except the wife's earnings
and actions for damages when she is living apart from her
husband, or carrying on a separate business or trade. The
statutes speak of a -marriage superinducing as a matter
of right, "partnership or community" of acquits or gains.
Repeatedly the statutes refer to the relation as a "partnership or community." The decisions of the Supreme
'Court of Louisiana clearly recognize the wife's ownership
of one-half of all the community income. They unequivocally declare that the wife's half interest in such community property "is not'a mere expectancy during the
marriage." (Phillipsv. Phillips,160 La. 813.)
As in the ease of other states, whose law we have discussed in connection with this matter in the Poe, Goodell
and Hopkins cases, supra, each spouse may by will dispose
of only his or her one-half of the community and is powerless to affect the other'shalf. In case of death intestate
one-half descends to the heirs of the decedent, and the.
other spouse is powerless to prevent this.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

While the husband is the manager of the affairs of the
marital partnership, the limitations upon the wrongful

exercise of his power over community property are
more' stringent than in, many states which have -a com-

munity system. In Louisiana, if the husband proves,
by reason of financial difficulties or the like, an unfit
manager, the wife may bring about an immediate
dissolution and- liquidation of the community property.
(Wolf & Clark v. Lowry, 10 La.. Ann. 272; Webb v. Bell;
24 La. Ann. 75; Brown & Learned v. Smythe, 40 La. Ann.
325.) And when the wife sues for a separation of the
property she is entitled to an accounting from the hugband for community income or property in his hands and
to reimbursement and retribution for any act done by him
in fraud of her rights. (Hill v. Hill, 115 La. 489; White
v. White, 159 La. 1065.)
In conclusion it may be noted that the Supreme Court:
of Louisiana has cited our own decisions in Warburton i
White, 176 U. S. 484, and Arnett v. Reade, 220 U. S. 311,
indicating that the exposition of the wife's rights and of
the nature of the community therein contained correctly
states the-Louisiana doctrine.
Inasmnuch, therefore, as, in Louisiana, the wife has a
present velsted interest in community property equal
to that of her husband, we hold 'that the spouses are entitled to file separate returns, each treating one-half of
the community income as income of each "of" them as
an " individual" as those words are used in §§ 210 (a) and
211 (a) of the Revenue, Act of 1926.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
