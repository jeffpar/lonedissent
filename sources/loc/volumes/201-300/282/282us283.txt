W. P. BROWN & SONS LUMBER COMPANY v.
BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 115. Argued December 3, 1930M-Decided January 5, 1931.
1. A return for 1917 income and profits tax was filed April 1, 1918;
the taxpayer, within the three year period for assessment allowed
by the Revenue Act of 1917, filed a waiver extending that period
to April 1, 1924; notice of a deficiency, an intradepartmental
appeal therefrom, a jeopardy assessment, and a claim of abatement all occurred in 1923, within the extended period. Held that
the waiver was valid even though executed by the taxpayer before
the date of the Revenue Act of' 1921 and not executed by the
Commissioner until 1922, and that, under § 250 (d) of the Act
of 1921, the assessment was in time. Stange v. United States, ante;
p. 270; Aiken v. Burnet, ante;p. 277. P. 285.
2. Three successive waivers held valid and productive of successive
extensions of the period for collecting 1917 taxes beyond the five'
year period provided in § 250 (d), Revenue Acd of 1921, although
the first waiver was executed by the taxpayer before the date of
that Act and not- executed by the Commissioner until 1922, and
did not refer expressly to collection, and although the other two,
both in terms, covering collection, were given after five years ,from
the filing of the return. Aiken v. Burnet, ante, p. 277; Stange v.
United States, ante, p. 270; Burnet v. Chicago Ry. Equipment
Co., post, p: 295. P. 286.
3. The right to collect a deficiency assessment of 1917 taxes, the
limitation period for which, as extended by waivers, did not
expire until after the taxpayer had appealed from the assessment
to the Board of Tax Appeals, did not become barred under § 250
(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 when the time specified in the last
extension 6xpired pending the appeal, even though the 'Commissioner, despite the appeal, remained'free to collect the tax as
assessed. So held in view of provisions of the Revenue Act of
1926, mentioned below. P. 288.

Statement of the Case

282 U.S.

4. The deficiency in 1917 taxes, was assessed, but not paid in full,
before June 3, 1924; the Commissioner, after June 2, 1924 (date of
the Revenue Act of that year,) but, before the date of the ReVenue
Act of 1926, finally determined the amount of deficiency; and the
taxpayer's appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals was taken before
the date of the 1926 Act and was then pending. Held:
(1) That § 283 (f) of the Act of 1926 confirmed the jurisdiction
of the Board over the appeal. P. 288.
(2) Sections 274 (a) and 277 (b) of that Act were made applicable by § 283 (f) and extended the period for collection until after
final, determination by the Board. P. 290.
1 (3) Section 1000 of the Act of 1926, amending the 1924 Act by
providing that, where the Board found a tax barred by limitations,
its decision should be that there was no deficiency, was intended to
confirm its jurisdiction in making final disposition of a deficiency,
already barred, and does-not affect the special jurisdiction conferred by § 283 (f) supra. P. 291.
(4) Under § 283, (f), Act of 1926, the suspension by § 27.7 (b)
of the time limit on collection applies retroactively to the date the
appeal was filed with the Board of Tax Appeals. P. 292.
(5) Section 278 (e), Act of 1926, which prohibits collection, in
the absence of a waiver prior to that Act, if at the date of its
enactment the tax was already barred, does not apply where,
although the waiver had in terms expired before that date, the time
is extended under § 283 (f) pending appeal before the Board. P. 292.
(6) Section. 283 (1), Act of 1926, which provides that in case of
any tax imposed by a 'prior Act there shall be added to the period
of suspension given by § 277 (b), any period prior to the Act of
1926 during which the Commissioner was prohibited from beginning
distraint or proceeding in court, does not limit application -of
§§ 274 (a) and 277 (b), as directed by § 283 (f), supra, to the
present case, even though the Commissioner was free to make
collection between the date of the appeal to the Board and the date
-of the 1926 Act. P. 293.',
38 F. (2d) 425; affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr., W. W. Spalding for petitioner.
Assistant Attorney General Rugg, with whom Solicitor
General Thacher, and Messrs. Claude R. Branch, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, Joseph H. Sheppard,
and Bradley B. Gilman were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JusTici. - BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
On April 1, 1918, W. P. Brown & Sons Lumber Company filed its income and profits tax return for the year
1917. The tax thereon was duly paid.- On March 6,
1923, the Bureau of Internal Revenue duly mailed to the
-taxpayer notice of a deficiency. A timely appeal was
taken to the Commissioner who had meanwhile, in March,
1923, made a jeopardy assessment. On March 27, 1923,
the taxpayer filed a claim for abatement. On June 4,
1924, this claim and the appeal were sent by the Income
Tax Unit to the Committee on Appeals and Review.'
On October 28, 1925, the Commissioner duly mailed to
the taxpayer notice of his determination, the claim .for
abatement being allowed in part and rejected in part.
On November 18, 1925, the taxpayer appealed to the
Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of the deficiency. There the parties stipulated the amount of the
additional tax, and submitted the question whether it was
barred by the statute of limitations. The Board held that
it was not, 13 B. T. A. 1425; and its ,decision was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 38 F. (2d) 425. This
Court granted a writ of certiorari, the briefs and arguments to be " limited to the question of the validity and
effect of the waivers." 281 U. S. 718.
The jeopardy assessment was clearly made in time.
The return' was filed April 1, 1918; the asessment was

of November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265, a period
of five*years from the filing of the return, was allbwed
for assesment, see Stange v. United States, decided this
day, ante, p. 270. Moreover, while there was under the Act
of 191' a limitation of three years on the period for assessment,2 the taxpayer-had duly executed and filed on December 13, 1920, -before the three years expired, a waiver
which extended the period for assessment to April 1,
1924. 8 This waiver was valid even though executed by
the taxpayer before the Act 6f 1921.-and not executed by
the Commissioner until 1922. Aiken v. Burnet,-decided
this-day, ante, p. 277. Theoriginal letter advising the tax-.
payer of the deficiency, the intradepartmental appeal
therefrom, the jeopardy assessment, and the claim - for
abatement were all made in 1923 -within the extended

period.

There was doubt whether the 1916 and 1917 Acts :required the

lection. See Stange v. United States, supra. No payment
has been made on account of the additional tax; and no
proceeding for collection has been taken, either by suit
or by distraint. Unless extended by waiver, the period
allowed for collection expired April 1, 1923. Three
waivers were given. The first was executed by the taxpayer and filed with the Bureau December 13, 1920; was
approved by the Commissioner on December 2, 1922; and
expired April 1, 1924. The second was executed by both
the taxpayer and the Commissioner on December 10, 1923,
and expired by its terms one' year from its date. The
third was executed by the taxpayer and the Commissioner
on October 25, 1924; and it Was in terms declared to be
"in effect for a period of one year after the expiration of
the statutory period of limitation within which assessments of taxes may be made for the year or years mentioned, or the statutory period of limitations as extended
-by Section 277 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1924, or byany
waivers already on file with 'the Bureau." All three
waivers were effective in extending the period for collection. The first was valid although executed by the taxpayer before the Act of 1921 and not executed by the
Commissioner until 1922, and operative even though it
did not make express reference to collection. Aiken v.
Burnet, decided this day, ante, p. 277. The second was
valid because given within the period as extended by the
first. The third, was valid because given within the period
as extended by the second. Moreover, both were valid
although given after five years from the date 6f the filing
of the.return.4 See Stange v. United States, ante, p. 270;

pired when the appeal was taken to the Board of Tax
Appeals on November 18, 1925.
Whether the right of collection became
barred thereafter' depends upon the construction to be given to the'
applicable statutes. The' taxpayer contends that the.
right of collection was barred on December 10, 1925, that
is twenty-two days after the appeal to the Board of Tax
Appeals had been taken, although this appeal was then
pending ithout having been heard, and indeed could not
have been heard under the practice of the Board. See
Rule 15,1 B. T. A. 1289; Rules 24-25, 7 B. T. A. 1361-62.
Besides the Act of 1921, provisions of the Revenue Act of
1924 and of'the Revenue Act of 1926 are relied upon:
The argument is that despite the appeal to the Board, the
Commissioner was at all times at liberty to enforce.payment of the tax as assessed by the jeopardy assessment or
as later reduced; that hence, collection 'was barred on
December 10, 1925, by § 250 (d) of the 1921 Act; and
that there was nothing in either the Revenue Act of June
*2, 1924, c. 234, 43 St. 253, or the Revenue'Act of February
26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, which kept alive*the right of
collection. The Board of Tax Appeals rested its decision
on provisions of the 1924 Act;' the Circuit Court of Appeals on those and also on the 1926 Act. Only the latter
act need be considered. Section 283. (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat.
64, provided:'

It relied upon G. L. Ramsey V.Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 345,
where it has held that on a jeopardy assessment which had been made
within the five year period as extended by a valid waiver, the Commissioner had, under § 278 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1924, six years
after 'the assessment within which to commence proceedings for collection, even though the parties had agreed in the waiver f6r-a different period for collection. The Board held further that there was
nothing in § 278 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 which restricted this
period to that mentioned in the waiver.:

"If any deficiency [in any 1916-21 income or profits
was assessed before June 3, 1924, but
taxes] . .
was not paid in full before that date, and if. the Commissioner after June 2, 1924, but before the enactment of this
Act finally determined the amount of the deficiency, and
if the person liable for such tax appealed before the enactment of this Act to the Board and the appeal is pending.
before the -Board at the time of the enactment of this
Act, the Board shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. In
all such cases the powers, duties, rights, and privileges of
the Commissioner and of the person who has brought the
appeal, and the jurisdiction of the Board and of the courts,
shall be determined . . . in the same manner as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. . . ."
This section is applicable to the case at bar. The deficiency was assessed in March, 1923; and hence before
"June 3, 1924," "and was not paid." On October 28,
1925, between the effective dates of the 1924 and the 1926
Acts, the Commissioner finally determined the amount
of the deficiency; and on November 18, 1925, also prior
to the enactment of the 1926 Act, the taxpayer appealed
to the Board of Tax Appeals. One effect of the section
was to confirm the jurisdiction of the Board.7 Another
6
Somewhat similar provisions relating to like cases under prior
estate and gift tax statutes were enacted at the same time. See

Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, §§ 318, (d), (e), and (f), 44 Stat. 9,
82-83; De Sabichi v. Commissioner, 4 B. T. A. 445.
7Although some doubt was expressed in Appeal of Reynolds &
Reynolds Co., 1 B. T. A. 275, the Board of Tax Appeals very early
took jurisdiction in these cases. Appeal of Joseph Garneau Co., Inc.,
1 B. T. A. 75; Appeal of Ormsby McKnight Mitchell, 1 B. T. A.

of Buffalo Slag Co., 1 B. T. A. 749. Compare Appeal of Terminal
Wine Co,, 1 B. T. A. 697. Following the Act of 1926, the Board has
uniformly held that § 283 (f) confirmed its jurisdiction. See Appeal;

18Subdivision (f) of § 283 refers to subdivision (e). That section
provides that the situation dealt with therein should be treated as,
ihough a deficiency notice had been sent under § 274 (a), and that
the tax "shall be collected and paid in the same manner and subject
to the same provisions and limitations

.

.

. as in 'the case of a

deficiency imposed [by the 1926 Act], except as otherwise provided
in section 277," and in certain sections relating to interest and.jeol.
ardy collection, which are here immaterial. 44 Stat. 64. Deficiencies
under the 1926 Act were governed by §§ 273, 274, and 275, 44 Stat.
55-57. Section 273, defining the term, and § 275, providing for
additio s in the case of negligence, fraud, etc., are not here applicable.
Section 274 (a) is quoted in the text. Section 277 (a) related to theperiods for assessment and collection generally and regnacted the five
year' limitation on the collection of 1917 taxes. It was qualified by
§ 277 (b), quoted in the text.
Section 283 (f) was, in addition, limited by § 283 (j) which prohibited an appeal to the Circuit .Coirt of Appeals if the hearing
before the'Board had been held prior to the enactment of the 1926
Act. Blair v. Currin, 24 F. (2d) 390; Blair v. Hendricks, 24 F.

case at bar, the hearing was -held on April 26, 1928. Also, § 284 (d),
44 Stat. 67, which imposed restrictions on the allowance of refunds
and credits after an appeal had been taken to the Board of Tax
Appeals, was made inapplicable to cases under § 283 (f). Compare

of the deficiency "shall be made, begun, or prosecuted
. .if
a petition has been filed with the Board [of
Tax Appeals], until the decision of the Board has become
final." 9 And § 277 (b) provided that the running of the
statute of limitations on "the beginning of distraint or a
proceeding in court for collection, in respect of any deficiency shall . . .. be suspended for thg period during
which the Commissioner is prohibited from
.
beginning distraint or a proceeding in court, and for 60 days
thereafter." "o That period still continues as there is not
yet a final determination of the Board."- The taxpayer
concedes that § 283 (f) of the 1926 Act confirmed the
jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals in the present
case, but contends that it did not operate to extend the
period for collection until after a final determination.
First. It is argued that § 283 (f) cannot be interpreted
as extending the time for the collection of the tai because
of § 1000.12 The latter section amended the 1924 Act by
providing that where the Board found that the tax was
barred by the statute of limitations, its decision should be
that there wa no deficiency. This section was inserted

suit or distraint proceeding may, by express provision in § 274 (a),
be enjoined. Peerless Woolen Mills v. Rose, 28 F. (2d) 661.

i6c"onfm the jurisdiction of the Board.in making final
dfosition of a deficielicy-;already barred. 3 It contains
nothing which affects the' special jurisdiction,-conferred
by §.283 (f).
Second. It is arguedthat neithei § 277 (b),-which suspended the running of he staitute, nor .283 (f), which
incorporated the former," indicate that § 277 (b) was to
be given a retroactive effect. The argument is unsound.
-Subdivision (f) of § 283 shows that it was the Intentioin
of Congress toWapply the provisions of § 277 (b) to cases
like that at bar. . "Since in such .cases the assessment (before June 3,1924), the flnal determination and the appeal
to. the'Boa rd (after -June 2, 1924); must expressly have
bOieurred prior to the enadtment of the i926 Act, the referonce to. § 277 (b) .onthined in § 283 (f)'necessarily meant
1hat in these cases the former section was to be applied
retroactively.
Third. The taxpayerqreliesalso upon § 278 (e)' 5 of
the 1926 Act which prohibited collection, in the absence
of a Wai'rer prior to that Act, if at the date of its enactihent the tax was already barred. The argument is that
since the last waiver by its terms expired on December
10, 1925, that is, -prior to the effective date of the 1926

Opinion of the Court.

Act, this section bars collection. That interpretation is
not correct. As was said by the court below: "The
authority for extending the time for collection under the
facts of the case at bar is found in § 283 (f), and not in
§ 278. . . . If we are to accept petitioners contention
that § 278 (e) is inconsistent with the interpretation we
have given § 283 (f), :we must necessarily hold that § 278
(e) in effect nuIliies the clear provisions of § 283 (f). Not
only is there nothing in the statute to warrant this interpretation, but the interrelation of § 278 (e) and § 283 (f)
makes the contrary clear." "6 38 F. (2d) 431.
Fourth. It is argued that inasmuch as the Commissioner was not prohibited from making collectiqn between
November 18, 1925, the date of the appeal, and February
26, 1926, the effective date of the 1926 Act,' and since
"IAs was pointed out below, the latter part of § 278 (e), -which
prohibits collection contrary to § 274 (a), quoted supra p. 290, recognizes and reinforces the prohibition against collection'while a case
is pending before the Board. See note 9, supra. Since this same
subsection 274 (a) is incorporated in § 283 (f), supra note 8, it seems
clear from this interrelation that § 278 (e) was not intended to
limit § 283 (f), and that the suspension 6f the statute given by
277 (b) is applicable to the instant case. See 38 F. (2d) 431.
17 The filing of the claim for abatement of the jeopardy assessment did not operate as a stay of collection. The claim filed in the
present case,. under § 252 of the 1921 Act (42 Stat. 268) and Mi. S.
3228 as dmended by § -1316 of that Act (42 Stat. 314), was apparently
not accompanied by a bond. Under such circumstances the filing of
the claim would not have prevented collection if the Commissioner
had believed that collection of the tax -was jeopardized. See Reg.
33 (1918 ed.), Art. 261; Reg. 45, Art. 1032; Reg. 62, Art. 1032; cf.
United States v. Burden, S ith & Co., 33 F. (gd) 229, 230. Prior
to thedecision in Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Co., 273
U. S. 346, it was, however, the common practice to postpone collection upon the filing of a claim for abatement if there was no doubt
as to the taxpayer's solvency. See H. Rep. No. 2, 70th Cong. 1st
Sess., December 7, 1927, p. 34.

Opinion of the Court.

282U.S.

the period for collection, as extended by the waivers, expiied December 10, 1925, § 277 (b) does not aid the
Commissioner because the' statute had run before that
section could cause it to be suspended. Attention is called
to another section of the 1926 Act, § 283 (1), which provided that in the ease of any tax imposedby a prior Act
there shall be added to the period of suspension given by
§ 277 (b), any period prior to the Act of 1926 during
which the Commissioner was prohibited from beginning
distraint or proceeding in court. 18 The argument is that
this'section indicates that § 274 (a) and § 277 (b) are not
to be'applied retroactively; that only the period, if any,
obtained under § 283 (1) can be added to the waivers;
and that iince the Commissioner was not prohibited from
collecting prior to the expiration bf the, last waiver, § 283
(1) is inapplicable. -Section 283 (1) expressly provides.
that the time therein granted shall be "in addition to the.
period-of suspension provided for in subdivision (b) o
section 277." It undoubtedly had reference to those cases
in which- a claim for abatement, accompanied by a bond,
had been filed and collection stayed between the 1924 Act
and 1926 Act.' 9 It caniot limit the application to the
case at bar of § 274 (a) and § 277 (b), as § 283 (f) directs.
This argument of the taxpayer is also unsound.

19 See § 279 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 300.
Compare § 283 (b) and (c) of the 1926 Act. These sections confirmed the jurisdiction of the Board in cases in which an assessment
had- been made and an appeal taken, or in which the 60-day period
had not expired before the 1926 Act-. :'Copare Plains Buying &
Selling Ass'n. v. Commissioner, 5 B. T. A. 1147, 1153. In such cases
a.jeopardy assessment and claim for abatement, accompanied by a
bond and providing for a stay of collection, between the 1924 and

1926 'Acts, would have been possible, and § 283 (1) would have
applied.
