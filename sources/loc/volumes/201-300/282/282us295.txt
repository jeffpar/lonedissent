BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. CHICAGO RAILWAY EQUIPMENT
COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO TME CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 231. Argued December 3, 1930.-Decided January 5, 193i.
1. The power of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under § 278
(c) of the Revenue Act of 1924, to sign with the taxpayer a
waiver to extend the time for assessment of income and profits taxes
under the/ Act of 1918, could be exercised after his determination
of deficiency had been appealed to and was pending before the
Boarfi of Tax Appeals. P. 298.
2. Thd Commissioner, when contemplating the making of a jeopardy
a~essment which the taxpayer desired to avoid, was authorized,
.nder his general administrative powers, to accept ihstead the
waiver, as a substitute means of insuring ultimate collection. P. 298.
3. The power of the Commissioner to sign a waiver under § 278
(c) of the 1924 Act existed after the expiration of the five year
limitation on assessment. § 277 (a). So held where that period
expired after the date of the Act, and without deciding whether
§ 278 (e) qualifies § 278 (c) as to waivers on assessments barred
before that date. P. 298.
4. Section'.281 (e) of the 1924 Act, which extended the time for
making claims for refund where a waiver of assessment had been
filed prior to certain specified dates, was merely to extend the time
for filing claims for refund in particular cases of taxes. There is
no necessary relation between it and § 278 (c). P. 300.
5. A taxpayer who has signed a waiver and has had the validity
of the alleged deficiency determined in the courts, on appeal from
the Board of Tax Appeals, has no good ground for complaint that
he cannot thereafter raise the same question on a claim for refund.
P. 301.
6. A waiver, signed while appeal from a deficiency determination,
duly noticed, was pending before the Board of Tax Appeals;
provided that the time for making assessment should continue
until a date specified and should then expire, "except that. if a

notice of deficiency in tax is sent to said taxpayer and if an appeal
is filed with said Board, then said date shall be extended by the
number of days between the date of mailing of said notice and the
date of final decision by said Board." Held that the quoted
provision applied to the existing notice and appeal, the object of
the waiver having been tr have the pending case determined without exacting payment, or a bond, from the taxpayer mean*hile.

P.302.
7. A waiver extendi g time for a deficiency assessment, made when
assessment was already barred, cannot be held void for duress
because procured by a threat of the Commissioner to make a
jeopardy assessment and enforce collection, where, in the absence
ofa determination that the bar had attached, it was the Commissioner's duty to proceed to insure the assessment and collection.

M . JusTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, § 278 (c), 43.
Stat. 253, 300, provides concerning income and profits
taxes under the Revenue Act of 1918: "Where both the
Commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the-time prescribed
in section 277 for its assessment the tax may be assessed

BURNET v. RAILWAY EQUIPMENT CO.

at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed
upon." Section 277 (a) (2), 43 Stat. 299, provides that
the tax "shall be assessed within five years after the
return was fied, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of
such period." Section 277 (b) provides that if due notice
of the determination of a deficiency has been mailed to
the taxpayer, and an appeal is taken to the Board of Tax
Appeals, the time for making the assessment shall be
extended "by the number of days between the date of
mailing of such notice and the date of the final decision
by the Board." Section 278 (d) provides that when
assessed within the period prescribed by § 277 or § 278,
"such tax may be collected by distraintlor by a proceeding in court, begun within six years after the assessment
of the tax." This case presents, amongothers, the question whether a waiver given while the case was pending
before the Board of Tax Appeals but after the expiration
of five years from the filing of the return tolls the statute
of limitations.
On June 16, 1919, the Chicago Railway Equipment
Company filed its income and profits tax return for 1918.
On March 14, 1925, the Commissioner determined a
deficiency-and gave due notice thereof. On May 6, 1925,
the taxpayer filed its appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals, On December 10, 1925, the taxpayer and the
Commissioner executed an agreement which provided that
"the time for making any assessment . . . shall remain in effect until December 31, 1926, and shall then
expire except that if a notice of a deficiency in tax is sent
to said taxpayer by registered mail before said date and
if an appeal is filed with said Board [of Tax
Appeals] then said date shall be'extended by the number
of days between the date of mailing of said notice of deficiency and the date of final decision by said board." On
July 28, 1926, the B6ard confirned, in the main, the CoinI

missioner's determination, 4 B. T. A. 452; but the Circuit
Court of Appeals remanded the case to it for further
proceedings. 20 F. (2d) 10. Then, for the first time the
defense was made that the deficiency had been barred by
the statute of limitations. The Board overruled the ob-.
jection, 13 B. T. A. 471; but its decision was reversed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals, 39 F. (2d) 378. This Court
granted a writ of certiorari.
First. The taxpayer contends that the agreement of
December 10, 1925, was inoperative because the Commissioner lacked the power to sign a waiver after an appeal
from his determination to the Board of Tax Appeals.
The argument is that once such an appeal has been filed,
the Commissioner's powers of investigation and determination have been exhausted; that thereafter his duty in
making an assessment pursuant to the Board's order is
purely ministerial; that the waiver is in effect an agreement not to plead the statute of limitations; and that the
Commissioner is not authorized to receive such a waiver.
As we said in Stange v. United States, decided this day,
ante, p. 270, the Commissioner's signature was required
purely for administrative purposes. See Florsheim Bros.
Co. v. United States, 280 U. S. 453, 466. There was nothing in this requirement which limits the period during
which a waiver may be effectively given. Compare Aiken
v. Commissioner, decided this day, ante, p. 277. Moreover, at the time this waiver was executed, the Commissioner was contemplating the making of a jeopardy assessment which the taxpayer desired to avoid. The
Commissioner was clearly authorized, under his "general
administrative powers, to accept instead the waiver as a
substitute means. of insuring ultimate collection. See
Aiken v. Commissioner,supra.
Second. The taxpayer contends that the waiver was
inoperative because the Commissioner lacked the power
to sign a waiver after the expiration of the five-year

period.1 'What was said on this subject in reference to a
waiver under the 1921 Act in Stange v. United States,
supra,is applicable also to the corresponding provision of
the 1924 Act. A difference in phraseology is called to our
attention; but it is without significance. The further
argument is made that in view of other sections in the
1924 Act,2 an interpretation of § 278 (c) which permitted
the giving of a waiver after the expiration of the five
years, would lead to absurdities and inequalities which
Congress could not have intended. Reference is made,
first, to § 278 (e)' which, it is urged, renders inoperative
any waiver signed after the enactment of the statute
where the assessment in question was already barred prior
thereto.' The inequality charged is that the limitation
period for the assessment of !)18 taxes due under a return
filed before June 2, 1919, could not, under the suggested
interpretation, -be waived after June 2, 1924, but that the'
corresponding limitation for the same tax due under a
return filed after June 2, 1919, could be so waived. We
1See

Joy Floral Co. v. Commissioner, 29 F. (2d) 865; Columbian

Iron Works v. Brock, 38 F. (2d) 816. In these cases the taxpayers'
contention was sustained and the waivers held inoperative.
2Respondent also cites § 278 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1926,
c. 27, 44 Stat 9, 59, which substantially regnacted § 278 (e) of the
1924 Act, and urges that particular discriminations would result from
the combined effect, under certain suggested interpretations, of these
two sections. But, the effect of a later statute cannot authorize an
unintended and undesirable construction of an earlier act. Compare
Russell v. United States, 278 U. S. 181, 188.

if at the time of the enactment of this Act such assess. was barred by the period of limitation then in

..
.

4 In the case at bar, the assessment would not have been barred
until June 16, 1924, five years from the date of the return, and after
the enactment of the 1924 Act, so that § 278 (e) is wholly inapplicable. Respondent offers the case of a tax under an earlier return
merely for the purposes of its argument,

need not determine whether respondent is correct in assuming that § 278 (e) qualifies § 278 (c) in respect to
waivers on assessment of taxes barred prior to June 2,
1924;1 for even if that section has this effect, no objectionable inequality would result in permitting a"r6Vival
of liability in one case and not in the other. Some arbitrary date must be taken for the imposition of a period
of limitation. It may be taken likewise in regard to its
removal.
Attention is also called to § 281 (e) of the 1924 Act,'
which extended the time for making claims for refund
where a waiver of assessment had been filed prior to certain specified dates, ' and it is'said that § 278 (c), as inter5

Subdivision (e) cannot be said to qualify every other subdivision
in § 278. Nothing indicates an intention to have it limit the effect
of § 278 (a) which permits assessment to be made or suit to be
brought at any time in the case of a false or fraudulent return or a
failure to file -aiy .return. Compare United States v. Updike, 281
U. S. 489, 495;. United' States v. Lazenby, 5 F. (2d) 827. Nor is
there any indication that it should qualify subsection (c) -which
provides for the giving of waivers. But see Jacobs Brothers Co. v.
Commissioner, 19 B. T. A. 315, which involved § 278 (c) and related
sections of the 1926 Act, supra, note 2. Compare Steiner Mfg. Co.
v. Commissioner, 18 B. T. A. 740; James & Holmstrom Piano Co. v.
Commissioner, 19 B. T. A. 322; Gillespiev. Commissioner, 20 B. T. A.
1068, 1079; Wetherell Bros. Co. v. White, D. Mass., decided December 3, 1930, U. S. Daily, December 30, 1930, p. 3291. The decision
in Russell v. United States, 278 U. S. 181, involved the interpretation of subdivision (d) which extended the period for collection without any act on the part of the taxpayer. Subdivision (c) is effective
only if the taxpayer voluntarily executed a waiver.

E. g., for 1917 taxes, within five years after the return was filed;
for 1918 taxes, before June 15, 1924; for 1919 taxes, before June 15,

and 1318 taxes, on or before April 1, 1926 for 1919 taxes; or if the
waiver was extended by a new waiver, then respectively before

preted, would, when read with § 281 (e), result in a discrimination against those taxpayers who hadt signed, a
waiver after the statute had run. The argu nent is-that
such taxpayers would still he liable for the ax, but hat
no corresponding extension of the limitation jn claims iorrefund would be given. The dates specified in § 281 (e),
however, do not coincide with the -periods ofIlimitation on
assessment and collection. The purpose of that. section
was merely to extend the time for filing claims for refund,
in particular cases of taxes for the yers 1917-1919.
There is no necessary relation between it and §'278 (a).
-Moreover, a takpayer who has signed a jwaiver and has
had the validity of the alleged deficienck determined in
the courts, on appeal from the Board's determination, has
no good ground for complaint that he cannot thereafter
raise the same qiestion on a claim for refund."
was paid. 43 Stat. 116, 302, 1115-16.

See Reg. 65, Art. 1307.

These provisions followed a sinilar section in the Act of March 4
1923, c. 276, 42 Stat. 1504-05, dealing with 1917 taxes; they were
regnacted, to include claims for the refund of 1920 and 1921 taxes,
in § 284 (g) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 67. Prior
to the enactment of § 281 (e) of the 1924 Act, all claims for refund
had to be filed within five years from the date the return was due,
or within two years from the date the tax was paid, A. S. § 3228,
as amended by the Act of March'4, 1923, supra. See Revenue Act
of 1918, c. 18, § 252, 40 Stat. 1057, 1085; Revenue Act of 1921,
c. 136, § 252, 42 Stat. 227, 268; Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, § 1012,

The 1926 Act expressly provided that where an appeal had been
taken, from a deficiency determination, no credit or refund could
thereafter be allowed except in conformance with the decision of the
Board. Section 284 (d), c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 67. And refund or credit
was allowable only if the petition had been filed with the Board
within four years after the tax was paid, or a timely claim for refund
had been made. Section 284 (e), 44 Stat. 67. This section was

Third. The taxpayer contends thai, by its terms, the
waiver expired December 31, 1926. The argument is that
since the appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals had already
been taken, the latter part of the instrument, relating to
an extension of the time for assessment equal to the number of days the case would be before the Board, is inapplicable. The immediate object for which the waiver was
given was to enable the case to be determined, -without
respondent being obliged to pay or to fiirnish bond; and
it must have been assumed that thereafter the Commissioner would duly assess 'and collect the amount of the
deficiency. . The record reveals 'hat three days 'before the
execution of the waiver, the SQlicitor of Internal Revenue
wrote respondent that "as it is impossible at this time to
determine whether the casq will be disposed of by the
board prior to the expiration of the period. . . . you
are requested to execute..
.
the enclosed waiver
."; and'he stated further that if the waiver were
not given,, the Commissioner would make a jeopardy assessment and require a bond aa -a condition of deferring
collection. Consequently, the provisions of 'the latter part
of the waiyer were clearly intended to be applicable; and
while its language perhaps was not as apt as it might have
been, 9 there is nlo basis for denying its obvious-purpose.
amended by § 507 of the 1928 Act, c. 852, 45 Stat. 871; 26 U. S. C.,
§ 1065 (e), to make the filing of a claim for refund or credit unnecessary where an appeal was taken. On the general problem of
refunds, compare H. Rep. No. 1, 69th Cong., 1st Ses§., December 7,
1925, pp. 13-14; Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means
on Revenue Revision of 1925, id., pp. 285-92; 504, 934, et seq., 98183; Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Finance, on H. R. 1,
id., January 4, 1926, pp. 192-94, 208-09.
9 The waiirer was executed on the standard mimeographed form
generally used prior to the mailing of a deficiency letter. Had it
read: ". . , if a notice of deficiency was sent . . ." before

Opinion of the Court.

Fourth. The taxpayer contends that the waiver was
inoperative because secured by duress. The argument
is that while the Commissioner in*December, 1925, might
have made a jeopardy assessment and have enforced collection, such action would have been illegal because the
statutory period had then expired, and that a waiver procured by such a threat is ineffective. Whether or not the
Commissioner would have been liable to the'taxpayer for
& collection made as the result of a jeopardy assessment
in 1925, we need not determine. He clearly had the power
to make such assessment and thereby compel the filing of
a claim for abatement and the giving of a bond," or, if
such claim and accompanying bond were not filed, to rhake
collection and relegate respondent to an action at law.
In the dbsence of a determination that this deficiency was
barred,11 it was the Commissioner's duty to proceed to
insure the assessment and collection of the tax. At his
suggestion, the taxpayer executed the waiver. Thereby
it was enabled to have all questions concerning the alleged
deficiency considered by the Board. A waiver given under such circumstances is not invalid. This contention,
which seems to have been raised for the first time in this
Court, is also unsound.
Reversed.
December 31, 1926, there could be no doubt of its applicability to the
appeal then pending. Its meaning, in view of the circumstances
uqnaer which it was given, is nevertheless clear.
10 See Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, § 274 (d) and § 279 (a), 43

Stat. 253, 297, 300.
11 Other waivers were alleged to be in existence, and while they
were not produced at the trial before the Board, it is evident that in
December, 1925, the Commissioner was of the opinion that th deficiency, already determined, was not barred. This was clearly stated
in the letter to respondent requesting a waiver.
