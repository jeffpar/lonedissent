I think, it controls here. It is true that there are differences in matters of fact between the present case and that
case, but they seem to me not to be of a character to affect
the pertinence of the Anderson decision and call for the
application of a different rule. For that reason alone I
concur in the opinion of the court just annpunced. Were

POE, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUJE, v.
SEABORN.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
'THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 15.

Argued October 21, 1930.-Decided November,24, 1930.

1. In §§ 210 (a) and 211 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which lay
a tax upon the "net income of every individual," the use of the
word "of" denotes ownership and, in the absence of further definition by Congress, a broader significance should not be imputed
to the phrase. P. 109.
2. The question whether the interest of a wife in community income
amounts to ownership, and is therefore taxable and returnable
under the Revenue Act of 1926 apart from the interest of the
husband, is to be determined by the state law of community
property. P. 110.
3. By the law of the State of Washington, the wife has a vested
property right, equal to that of her husband, in the community
property and in the income of the community, including salaries
or wages of either husband or wife, or both. P. 111.
4. Although, by the Washington law, the husband has broad power
of control with limited accountability to the wife, this power is
conferred on him as agent of the community; it does not make
him the owner of all the community property and income, nor
negative the wife's present interest therein as equal co-owner.
Id.
5. Section 1212 of the Revenue Act of 1926, providing that "Income

in the income of which the wife has a vested interest as distinguished from an expectancy, shall be held to be correctly returned
if returned by the spouse to whom the income belonged under
the state law applicable to such marital , community for such
period" and that "any spouse who elected so to return such income
shall not be entitled to any credit or refund on the ground that such
income should have been returned by the other spouse," waq not
intended to open for the future the question whether in community
property States other than California the wife is entitled to make
return of one-half the community income, as had been decided in
the affirmative by executive construction; the purpose was merely
to prevent a serious situation as to resettlements, etc., that would
follow if this Court should overturn that executive construction.
P. 114.
6. Joint Resolution No. 88, 71st Congress (46 Stat. 589), extending the time for the assessment, refund, and credit of income taxes
for 1927 and 1928, in the case of any married individual where such
individual or his or her spouse filed a separate income tax return
for such taxable year and included therein income which under the
laws of the State upon receipt became community property, was
intended to save the Government's right of settlement in the
event that its test suits should be decided in favor of its contention that under the Revenue Act of 1926 community income in
other community property States, as in California, is returnable as
the husband's income. P. 115.'
7. Where the language of a statute is ambiguous, the Court would
be constrained to follow a long and unbroken line of executive
construction; applicable to words which Congress repeatedly
re~mployed in Acts passed subsequent to such construction and
has refused to change. P. 116.
8. The constitutional requirement of uniformity in taxation is not
intrinsic, but geographic; and differences of state law, which may
bring a person within or without the category designated by Congress as taxable, may not be read into the Revenue Act to spell
out a lack of uniformity., P. 117.

Argument for the Collector.

Internal Revenue an amount paid under protest on account of income taxes for 1927. This Court ordered the
entire record to be sent up. The case is one of four cases
instituted by the Government to aetermine whether,
under the Revenue Act of 1926, in the States of Washington, Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, married taxpayers
are entitled each to return for income "taxone-half of the
community income. It was argued with the other cases
(see post, pp. 118, 122 and 127,) and the arguments, in
so far as they related to the construction of the federal
statute, were the same in all.
Solicitor General Thacher,with whom Assist'ant Attorney General Youngquist, Mr. Sewall Key and Miss Helen
R. Carloss, Special Assistants to the Attorney General,
Messrs. ClarenceM. Charest, General Counsel, aud T. H.
Lewis,.Jr., Special Attorney, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
were on the brief, for Poe, Collector of Internal Revenue.
This Court, in the case of United States v. Robbins, 269
U. S. 315, held that a married man domiciled with his wife
in California should be taxed upon all of their community
income, basing its decision in part on the fact that the
husband alone could dispose of the fund and exercise exclusive rights of management and enjoyment over it. In
Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376, it was again emphasized
that the individual might .be taxed on income which he
had the right to control and enjoy irrespective of whether
he held any title whatever to the fund from which it was
derived.
Taxation of income to the person who controls and enjoys it, rather than to the person who holds title to the
property from which it is derived, is a principle which is
recognized in various provisions of the Revenue Acts.

§ 219, taxing the income of certain types of trusts to the
truistees, of other types to the beneficiaries, and of revocable trusts to the grantors..
Sections 210 and-211 of the Revenue Act of 1926, construed as similar provisions were construed in the Robbins case, do not require the taxation of income to the individual having purely formal rights of ownership.'
Their intent is that. the tax shall fall upon the person
exercising substantial rights of dominion and enjoyment.
In the Robbins case the rights of dominion and enjoyment were measured by very practical tests as to-what
the husband and wife could do with respect to the community income. The possession of unimportant rights
by the wife will not suffice to prove that one-half of the
community income should be taxed to her, for wives in
States not having the community property system also
Smay restrict to a certain extent the husband's disposition
of -hisproperty and income. The Act should, if possibl,
be so construed and applied as not to give married taxpayers r~siding in the community property States an
undue advantage over married taxpayers residing in other
States.

in income from community property equal to that of
her husband and' should therefore be permitted to report
one-half of it in her return, was based upon local conceptions of title to. the fund rather than of dominion and
control of the income therefrom: The contention that
the person who has formal title to a fund, or to income
therefrom, must pay the tax when the power of disposition is vested in another, finds no support in -the lan.gage of the statute. Indeed the very generality of the

words employed suggests that they are to be understood
in their ordinary meaning implying dominion and control, and not in any narrow, technical 'sense implying
formal, legal, or equitable ownership.
The Robbins case does not hold that the principle of
taxing income to the ".owner" of the income is to be
discarded, but rather that ownership in the statutory
sense must be tested, in cases of community ownership,
by the enjoyment of practical rights of ownership, and
not by words describing the interests of husband or wife,
or of "the community," as "vested" or "expectant,"
"legal" or "eq u i table." Cf. Corliss v. Bowers, supra.;

Argument for Seaborn.

282 U.S.

Mr. George Donworth, with whom Messrs. Elmer E.
Todd, Frank E. Holman, and Charles T. Donworth were
on the brief, for Seaborn.
The language and terms of the Revenue Act of 1926,
and previous Acts, clearly authorize the filing bf separate
returns of community income by husband and wife, and
cannot, as a matter of independent statutory construction,
be interpreted as taxing the husband in community property States on the half of the community income which
admittedly belongs to and is owned by the wife.
The statute taxes the income of -each individual, and
husbands and wives, as indiiriduals, are authorized and
permitted to make separate returns and include in such
separate returns the income of each spouse. Revenue Act
of 1926, §§ 210 (a), 211 (a), 223 (a), 223 (b).
There is nothing in the language of the Revenue Act
of 1926, or prior Acts, expressly or impliedly indicating
an intent on the part of Congress to tax an individual on
income belonging to another person, on the theory of
administration and control over the property and income,
exercised by the individual citizen sought to be taxed.
It is well settled and fundamental that statutes will
not be construed so as to levy taxes by implication.
The question as to what is property or income, and to
whom, it belongs, is a matter to be determined by the
local state law.
The uniform and long continued executive construction recognizing the right of husband and wife in all
community property States, except California,'.to repoE
separately the share of community income owned by each,
together with the repeated refusal of Congress to amend
the law so as to avoid such construction, and the re-enactment by Congress, without change, of the provisions so
construed, demonstrate that there was no intention in
the Act of 1926 .to taxhusbands on the half of the community partnership income belonging to their wives.

The Government's contention that control,, and not
ownership, is the test of income taxation under this Act
is inconsistent with and contrary to the last opinion of
the Attorney General on the subject. 35 Op. A. G. 265.
The Robbins case deals only with the local law of California, and the underlying theory of the decision is that
under the decisions and the statutes of California; the
husband is in law the owner of all of the community
property and income, and possesses all of the substantial
attributes of o'Wnership. Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376,
and Lucas v. Earl, 281 U. S. 111, are inapplicable.
The contention of appellant that the Revenue Acts impose income tax upon one individual as an incident to his
control of the income vested in another individual, under
the applicable laws of the States, must be rejected, because
such construction would render the statute unconstitutional. It would be in part a direct tax not based on the
income of the person taxed, and not apportioned. Eisner
v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189; Pollock v. Farmers Loan &
Tr. Co., 157 U. S. 429, 158 U. S. 601; Brushaber v. Union
Pac. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1. It would result in a tax not
geographically equal and uniform, as required by § 8 of
Art. I, of the Constitution. Such a basis would be so
arbitrary and capricious as to constitute taking of property without due process. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTs delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Seaborn and his wife, citizens and residents of the State
of Washington, made for the year 1927 separate income
tax returns as permitted bY the Revenue Act of 1926
c. 27, § 223 (U. S. C. App., Title 26, § 964).
During and prior to 1927 they accumulated property
comprising real estate, stocks, bonds and other personal

Opinion of the Court.

property. While the real estate stood in his name alone,
it is undisputed that all of the property real and personal constituted community property and that neither
owned any separate property or had any separate income.
The income comprised Seaborn's salary, interest on
bank deposits and on bonds, dividends, and profits on
sales of real and personal property. He and his wife each
returned one-half the total community income as gross
income and each deducted one-half of the community
expenses to arrive at the net income returned.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined
that all of the income should"have been reported in the
husband's return, and made an additional assessment
against him. Seaborn paid under protest, claimed a. refund, and on its rejection, brought this suit.
The District Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff
(32 Fed. (2d) 916); the Collector appealed, and the Circuit Court of Appeals certified to us the question whether.
the husband was bound to report for income tax the entire
income, or whether the spouses were entitled each to
return one-half thereof. This Court ordered the whole
record to be sent up.
The case requires us to construe Sections 210 (a) and
211 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (U. S. C. App., Tit.
26, §§ 951 and 952), and apply them, as construed, to the
interests of husband and wife in community property
under the law of Washington. These sections lay a tax
upon the net income -of every individual.' The Act goes
no farther, and furnishes no other standard or definition of
what constitutes an individual's income. The use-of the
word "of" denotes ownership. It would be a strained
construction, which, in the absence of further definition
by Congress, should impute a broader significance. to the
phrase.

110

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

The- Commissioner concedes that the answer to the
question involved in the cause must be found in the provisions of the law of the State, as to a wife's ownership of
or interest in community property. What, then, is the
law of Washington as to the ownership of community
property and of community income, including the earnings of the husband's and wife's labor?
The answer is found in the statutes of the State,2 and
the decisions interpreting them.
These statutes provide that, save for property acquired
by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance, all property however acquired after marriage, by either husband or wife,
or by both, is community property. On the death of
either spouse his or her interest is subject to testamentary
disposition, and failing that, it passes to the issue of the
decedent and not to the surviving spouse. While the husband has the management and control of community
personal property and like power of disposition thereof as
of his separate personal property, this power is'subject
to restrictions which are inconsistent with denial of the
wife's interest as co-owner. The wife may borrow for
community purposes and bind the community property
(Fielding v. Ketler, 86 Wash. 194).. Since the husband
may not discharge his -separate obligation out of community property, she may, suing alone, enjoin collection
of his separate debt out of community property (Fidelity
& Deposit Co. v. Clark, 144 Wash. 520). She may prevent his making substantial gifts out of community property without her consent (Parker v. Parker, 121 Wash.
24). The community property is not liable for the husband's torts not committed in carrying on the business
of the community (Schramm v. Steele, 97 Wash. 309).

POE v. SEABORN.
101

Opinion of the Court.

The books are full of expressions such as "the personal
property is just as much hers as his" (Maistom v. Rue,
92 Wash. 129); "her property right in it [an automobile]
is as great as his" (92 Wash. 133) ; "the title of one spouse
.'.. Was a legal title as well as that of the other" (Mabie
v. Whittaker, 10 Wash. 656, 663).
Without furtner extending, this opinion it must suffice
to say that it is clear the wife has, in Washington, 'a
vested property right in the-community property, equal
with that of her husband; and in the income of the community, including salaries or wages of either husband or
wife, or both. A description of the community system of
Washington and of the rights 'of the spouses, and of the
powers of the husband as manager, will be found in Warburton'v. White, 176 U. S. 484.
The taxpayer contends that if the test of taxability under Sections 210 and 211 is ownership, it is clear that
income of community-property is owned by the community and that husband and wife have each a present vested
one-half interest therein.
The Commissioner contends, however, that we are here
concerned not with mere names, nor even with mere technical legal titles; that calling the wife's interest vested
is nothing to the purpose, because the husband has such
broad powers of control and alienation, that while the
community lasts, he is essentially the owner of the whole
community property, and ought so to be considered for
the purposes of Sections 210 and 211. He points out
that as to personal property the husband may convey it,
may make contracts affecting it, may do anything with it
short of committing a fraud on his wife's rights. -And
though the wife must join in any sale of real estate, he
asserts that the saree Is true, by virtue of statutes, in
most States which do not have the community system. He

guishable from ownership, and that since the husband has
this, quoad community property and income, the income is
that "of" the husband under Sections 210-211 of the
income tax law.
We think, in view of the law of Washington above stated,
this contention is unsound. The community must
act through an agent. This Court has said with respect
to the community property system (Warburton v. White,
176 U. S. 494) that "property acquired during marriage
with community funds became an acquit of the community and not the sole property of the one in whose name
the property was bought, although by the law existing
at the time the husband was given the management, control and power of sale of such property. This right being
vested in him, not because he was the exclusive owner,
but because by law he was created the agent of the community."
In that case, it was held that such agency of the husband was neither a contract nor a property right vested
in him, and that it was competent to the legislature which
created the relation to alter it, to confer the agency on
the wife alone, or to confer a joint agency on both spouses,
if it saw fit,-all without infringing any property right of
the husband., See, also, Arnett v. Reade, 220 U. S. 311 at
319.
The reasons for conferring such sweeping powers of
management on the husband are not far to seek. Public
policy demands that in all ordinary circumstances, litigation between wife and husband during the life of the
community should be discouraged. Law-suits between
them would tend to subvert the marital relation. The
same policy dictates that third parties who deal with the
husband respecting community property shall be assured
that the wife shall not be permitted to nullify his transactions. The powers of partners, or of trustees of a spendthrift trust, furnish apt analogies.

POE v. SEABORN.
101

Opinion of the Court.

The obligations of the husband as agent of the community are no less real because the policy of the State limits
the wife's right to call him to account in a court. Power
is not synonymous with right. Nor is obligation coterminous with legal remedy. The law's investiture of the husband with broad powers, by no means negatives the wife's
present interest as a co-owner.
We are of opinion that under the law of Washington
the entire property and income of the community can no
more be said to be that of the husband, than it could
rightly be termed that of the wife.
We should be content to rest our decision on these considerations. Both parties have, however, relied on executive construction and the history of the income tax legislation as supporting their respective views. We shall,
therefore, deal with these matters.
The taxpayer points out that, following certain opinions
of the Attorney General,' the Decisions and Regulations
of the Treasury have uniformly made the distinction that
while .under California law the wife's interest in'community property amounts to a mere expectancy contingent on her husband's death and does not rise to the level
of a present interest, her interest under the laws of Washington, Arizona, Texas and some other states is a present
vested one. They have accordingly denied husband and
wife the privilege of making separate returns of. one-half

privilege to residents of such other states.4 ,
He relies further upon the fact that Congress has thrice,'
since these Decisions and Regulations were, promulgated,
re-enacted the income tax law without change of the
verbiage found in §§ 210 (a) and 211 (a), thus giving
legislative sanction to the executive construction. He
stands' also on the f~ct that twice the Treasury has suggested the insertion of a provision,6 which would impose
the tax on the husband in respect of the vhole community
income, and that Congress has not seen fit to adopt the
suggestion.
On the other hand the Commissioner says that, granted
the truth of these assertions, a different situation has been
,created as respects 1926 and subsequent years. For in
the 1926 Act there was inserted a section which plainly

.7 SEC. 1212. Income from any period before January 1, 1925, of a
marital community in the income of which the wife has a vested interest as distinguished from an expectancy, shall be heldto be correctly returned if returned by the spouse to whom the income
belonged under the State law applicable to such marital community
for such period. Any spouse who elected so to return such income
shall not be entitled to any credit or refund on the ground that such
income should have been returned by the other spouse. (U. S. C.
Supp. II. Title 26, Sec. 964a.)

POE v. SEABORN.
103

Opinion of the Qourt.

We attribute no such intent to the section as is ascribed
to it by the Commissioner. -We think that although Congress had twice refused to change the wording of the Act,
so as to tax community income to the husband in Washington and certain other states, in view of our decision
in UnitedStates v. Robbins, 269 U. S. 315, it felt we might
overturn the executive construction and assimilate the
situation in Washington to that we had determined existed in California. Section 1212 therefore was merely
inserted to prevent the serious situation as to resettlements, additional assessments and refunds which would
follow such a decision.
The same comments apply to the Joint Resolution No.
88, 71st Congress, on which the Commissioner relies.8
8 That the three-year period of limitation provided in section 277

of the Revenue Act of 1926 upon the assessment of income taxes
impos6d by that Act for the taxable year 1927, and the three-year
period of limitation provided in section 284 of the Revenue Act of
1926 in respect of refunds and credits of income taxes imposed by that
Act for the taxable year 1927 shall be extended for a period of one
year in the case of any married individual where such individual or
his or her spouse fled a separate income-tax return for such taxable
year and included therein income which under the laws of the State
upon receipt became community property.
Sc. 2. The two-year period of limitation provided in section 275
of the Revenue Act of 1928 upon the assessment of income taxes
imposed by Title I of that Act for the taxable year 1928, and the twoyear period of limitation provided in section 322 of the Revenue Act
of 1928 in respect of refunds and credits of income taxes imposed by
that Act for the taxable year 1928 shall be extended for a period of
one year in the case of any married individual where such individual
or his or her spouse fled a separate income-tax return for such taxable year and included therein income which under the laws of the
State upon receipt became community property.
Sc. 3. The periods of limitations extended by this joint resolution
shall, as so extended, be considered to be provided in sections 277
and 284 of the Revenue Act of 1926 and sections 275 and 322 of the
Revenue Act of 1928, respectively.
Sac. 4. Nothing herein shall be construed as extending any period of
limitation which has expired before the enactment of this joint resolution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

It is obvious that this resolution was intended to save
the Government's right of resettlement, in event that the
proposed test suits, of which this is one, should be decided
in favor of the Government's present contention. See
the Report of the Ways and Means Committee on the
resolution (Cong. Record, June 11, 1930, pp. 10923-10925).
On the whqle, we feel that, were the matter less clear
than we think it is, on the words of the income tax law
as applied to the situation in Washington, we should be
constrained to follow the long and unbroken line'of executive construction, applicable to words which Congress
repeatedly re~mployed in acts passed subsequent to such
construction, (New York v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 367; National Lead Co. v. United States, 252 U. S. 140; United
States v. Farrar,281 U. S. 624), re~nforced, as it is, by
Congress' refusal to change the wording of the Acts to
make community income in states whose law is like that
of Washington returnable as the husband's income.
The Commissioner urges that we have, in principal,
decided the instant question in favor of the Government.
He relies on United States v. Robbins, 269 U. S. 315;
Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S.376, and Lucas v. Earl, 281
U. S. 111.
In the Robbins case, we found that the law of California, as construed by her own courts, gave the wife a
mere expectancy and that the property rights of the husband during the life of the community were so complete
that he was in fact the owner. Moreover, we there
pointed out that this accorded with the executive construction of the Act as to California.
The Corliss case raised no issue as to the intent of Congress, but as to its power. We held that where a donor
retains the power at any time to revest himself with the
principal of the gift, Congriess may declare that he still
owns the income. While he has technically parted with
title, yet he in fact retains ownership, and all its incidents.

POE v. SEABORN.
101

Opinion of the Court.

But here the husband never has ownership. That is in
the community at the moment of acquisition.
In the Earl case a husband and wife contracted that any
property they had or might thereafter acquire in any way,
either by earnings (including salaries, fees, etc.), or any
rights by contract or otherwise, "shall be treated and
considered and hereby is declared to be received held
taken and owned by us as joint tenants . . ." We held
that, assuming the validity of the contract under local
law, it still remained true that the husband's professional
fees, earned in years subsequent to the date of the contract, were his individual income, "derived from salaries,
wages, or compensation for personal services" under 1§1
210, 211, 212 (a) and 213 of the Revenue Act of 1918.
The very assignment in that case was bottomed on the
fact that the earnings would be the husband's property,
else there would have been nothing on which it could
oberate. That case presents quite a different question
from this, because here, by law, the earnings are never
the property of the husband, but that of the community.
Finally the argument is pressed upon us that the Commissioner's ruling will work uniformity of incidence and
operation of the tax in the various states, while the view
urged by the taxpayer will make the tax fall unevenly
upon married people. This argument cuts both ways.
When it is remembered that a wife's earnings are a part
of the community property equally with her husband's, it
may well seem to those who live in states where a wife's
earnings are her own, that it would not tend to promote
uniformity to tax the husband on her earnings as part
of his income. The answer to such argument, however,
is, that the constitutional requirement of uniformity is
not intrinsic, but geographic. Billings v. United States,
232 U. S. 261; Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41. And differences of state law,
which may bring a person within or without the category
