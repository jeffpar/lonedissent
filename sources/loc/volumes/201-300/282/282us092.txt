returned and to carry out the provisions of the title; and § 13 (d)
that "A corporation ... keeping accounts upon any basis other
than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other
basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, make its return upon
the basis upon which its accounts are kept, in which case the tax
shall be computed upon its income as so returned." A Treasury
ruling with respect to returns under § 12 (a) and 13 (d) contemplated that income and authorized deductioni should be computed
and accounted for. on the same basis and that the same practice
should be consistently followed year after year. The returns
of a taxpayer for 1916 and 1917 stated that they were made.
on the7 basis of actual receipts. and disbursements. Each return,
however, included bills and accounts receivable and payable and
employed the inventory basis-a praetice which would have been
authorized by Treasury regulations- if the returns had been governed by earlier Acts'which contained provisions like those of
§ 12 (a), supra, but which lacked the new provisions of §§ 13 (b)
and. 13 (d). A munitions tax, which accrued in 1916, and was
paid in 1917, was deducted by the taxpayer under §. 12 (a), in
the 1917 return. Held:
1. That the regulations mentioned, which required the use of
inventories in proper cases and permitted the deduction of accounts payable when accounts receivable, were brought- into the
income account, were supplementary to the provisions of the earlier
Acts and do not have the effect of classifying items receivable and
payable as cash receipts and disbursements when thq like provisions of § 12 (a) are to be construed with the new provisions,
§§ 13 (d) and 13 (b), of the 1916 Act. P. 97.
2. Although by § 12 *() taxes are required to be deducted only"
in the 'year when paid, § 13 (d), in the light of its legislative history, plainly indicates that the returns contemplated by it are to
be dealt with as a separate class, distinct from those based on
actual receipts and disbursements alone described by § 12 (a).

basis, the return must be filed on the accrual basis. P. 98.

Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment of the District Court, 24 F. (2d) 230, for the Collector in an action
to recover income and excess pxofits taxes assessed and
paid for 1917.
Mr. John T. Scott for petitioner.
Mr. Claude R. Branch, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom Assistant Attorney Genieral
Youngquist, Messrs. Sewall Key, J. Louis Monarch, and
S. Dee Hanson, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, were on the brief, for

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner, a manufacturer of metal castings, brought
suit in the District Court for Northern Ohio to recover
income and excess profits taxes assessed and paid for the
calendar year 1917. Right to recover was asserted on the
sole ground that a munitions tax levied under Title III
of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463,39 Stat. 756, 780, which
became due and was paid by petitioner in 1917, was

correctly deducted from gross income in petitioner's tax
return for that year. The Commissioner, rejecting this
contention, deducted the tax from gross income for 1916,
the year when it accrued, see United States v. Anderson,
269 U. S. 422, and collected a correspondingly increased
income and profits tax for 1917, which is involved in the
present suit.
The District Court, finding that petitioner kept its
'books and filed its tax returns for 1916 and 1917 on the
"accrual basis," gave judgment for the Collector, 24
F. (2d) 230, which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed, 31 F. (2d) 669. Both courts held, on the
authority of United States v. Anderson, supra,that as the
books were kept and returns made on the accrual basis, the
munitions tax which accrued in 1916 could not be deducted
in the return for 1917.
Petitioner's returns for 1916 and 1917 were made after
the effective date of §§ 12 (a), 13 (b) and 13 (d) of the
Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463, 39 Stat. 767, 771). The Act
imposes a tax on net income and profits ascertained,, as
provided by 1§ 12 (a), by deducting from gross income
expenses, interest and taxes paid, and losses sustained,
during the calendar year. Section 13 (d) provides that
"A corporation

other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income,
may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of
the Treasury, make its retuin upon the basis upon Which
its accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned."
Petitioner, in response to an inquiry on the form for
the 1916 return, stated that it was "made on the basis of
actual receipts and disbursements," a statement which it
repeated in the 1917 return with the qualification that
"Bills and accounts payable and receivable are treated

as receipts and disbursements."- In both returns, bills and
accounts, payable and receivable, in fact were treated as
actual receipts and disbursements; and both were based
on inventories taken at the beginning and end of the
taxable year. The munitions tax deducted in the 1917
return first appeared on the taxpayer's books in that year.
Petitioner contends that its returns were made as
"cash receipts and disbursements" returns under § 12
(a) and not under- § 13 (d), and that since by § 12 (a)
taxes are required to be deducted only in the year when
paid, its munitions tax was rightly deducted in the 1917
return. In support of this contention, it is pointed out
that § 12 (a) of the 1916 Act does not differ materiallyfrom corresponding provisions of the Revenue Acts of
1909 and 1913 (Corporation Excise Tax Act of Aug. 5,
1909, c. 6, §.38, 36 Stat. 11, 112; Corporation Income
Tax Act of Oct. 3, 1913,.c. 16, § II, subdiv. G, 38 Stat.
114, 172), and as petitioner's returns for 1916 and 1917
would have been authorized under these earlier acts, and
Treasury Regulations supplementing them, it is argued'
that petitioner's right to deduct taxes when paid was not
altered by the addition to the revenue laws, in the 1916
Act, of § 13 (d), which merely gave to the taxpayer an
option, not availed of by petitioner, to make a return on
the accrual basis.
This argument is, in substance, that considered and rejected by the Court in United States v. Anderson, -supra,
p. 439. There, as here, the taxpayer's return for 1917
computed income on the basis of inventories and accrued
items, payable and receivable, appearing on the taxpayer's
books of account for that year, but deducted from gross
income the munitions tax, paid in 1917, which had accrued the year before. The return, as made, would have
been permissible under the Revenue Acts preceding that
of 1916; but it was held that under that Act the tax was
required to be deducted in the year when it accrued.

ALUMINUM CASTINGS CO. v. ROUTZAHN. 97
92

Opinion of the Court.

Section 12 (a) of the 1916 Act, like its prototypes in the
earlier legislation, deals only with the deduction from gross
income of amounts paid out or losses sustained. None
of them, in terms, permitted the deduction of accounts
payable or made any provision for the use of inventories
in computing net income. Experience demonstrating that
income derived from merchandising and nanufacturing
businesses could not be computed on the basis of receipts
and disbursements alone, treasury regulations were promulgated requiring the use of inventories in proper cases,
and permitting the deduction of accounts payable when
accounts receivable were brought into the income account.
Treasury Regulations 31, Dec. 3, 1909, under the Act of
Aug. 5, 1909; 33, Jan. 5, 1914, under the Act of Oct. 3,
1913.
But this action of the Department, born of necessity in
order to arrive at the income of certain businesses, was
neither a classification nor an irrevocable designation of
items receivable and payable as cash receipts and disbursements. Although the regulations supplemented the provisions of the statute by providing for a different method of
computing income, they did not alter the meaning of its
words, or preclude acceptance of them at their face value
when reenacted in a new legislative setting. Classification took place when § 13 (d) was substituted for existing
treasurr regulations,' and broadly authorized returns under it by taxpayers "keeping accounts upon any basis
other than that of actual receipts and disbursements," a
phrase which, in the light of the legislative history, plainly
indicates that the returns contemplated by § 13 (d) were
Pending the adoption of regulations applicable to the Act of 1916,
Treasury Decision 2367, Sept. 14, 1916, continued existing regulations

in force only so far as not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1916
Act. New regulations applicable to §§ 12 (a) and 13 (d), adopted in
Treasury Decision 2433, Jan. 8, 1917, before petitioner filed its 1916

and 1917 returns, are considered infra, p. 98.

to be dealt with as x separate class, distinct from these
baked on actual receipts and disbursements alone described
2
by _§ 12 (a).
By these sections thi iling of a return under §.13 (a),
where the taxpayer is able to comply with its require-ments, is optional if he isaIJdo able to prepare a return
on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements which
reflects true income. But " notwithstandipg the option
given taxpayers, it is the purpose of the Act to require
returns that clearly reflect taxable income." United
States v. Mitchell, 271 U. S. 9, 12. By .§ 13 (b) of the
1916 Act, which was new, the return in every case is iequired to state such data as are "appropriate and in the
opinion of the commissioner necessary to determine the
correctness of the net income returned and to carry out
the provisions of this title." It follows that the return
must-b'e filed on the accrual basis under 19 13 (d), wher"
true income cannot be arrived at on the basis of actu1
receipts and disbursements. Bee United States v. Anderson, supra, pp. 437, 440. Any other construction of §§ 12
(a) -and 13 (d) would disregard the requirement of § 13
(b) and the dominating purpose of the, Act, by enabling
the taxpayer to file a return which did 1.ot reflect true
income. See United States v. Mitchell, supra, pp. 12, 13.
it was in recognition of this, and in compliance with § 13
.(b), that Treasury Decision 2433, Jan. 8, 1917, provided
with respect to returns made'under §§ 12 (a) and 13 (d):

The Report of the Committee on Ways and Means (House Report
No. 922, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4) states with reference to the
income tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916:
"As two systems of bookkeeping are in use in the United States,
one based on the cash or .receipt basis and the other on the accrual
basis, it was deemed advisable to provide in the proposed measure
that an individual or corporation may make return of income on
either the cash or accrued basis, if the basis selected clearly reflects
the income."

ALUMINUM CASTINGS CO. v. ROUTZAHN. 99
92

Opinion of the Court.

"This ruling contemplates that the income and authorized deductions shafl be computed'and accounted for on
the same basis and that the same practice -shall be consistently followed year after year."
This ruling antedated petitioner's 1916 and 1917 returns,
and obviously gross income and deductions in its returns
were not "accounted for on the same basis." Its incofme
for 1917 could'not be ascertained by deducting from gross
income, including receivables, some items of cost and expense, attributable to the production of 1917 income,
which accrued but were not paid in that year, and the
munitions tax, which was paid in 1917, but which accrued
and was attributable to the production of income in 1916.
Petitioner, relying on the declarations in its returns
that they were made on the basis of actual receipts and
disbursements, contends that for that reason they must
be deemed made under § 12 (a.) and not under i§ 13 (d).
But whether a return is made on the accrual basis, or on
that of actual receipts and disbursement%, is not determined by the label which the taxpay.r chooses to place
upon it. The use of inventories, and the inclusion in the
returns of accrual items of receipts and disbursements appearing on petitioner's books, indicate the general and
controlling character of the account, Niles Bement Pond
Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 357, 360; United States v.
Anderson, supra,pp. 442, 443, and support the finding of
the trial court that books and returns were on the accrual
basis. The record does not disclose that petitioner offered
to make a return for 1917 on the basis of actual receipts
and disbursements, or that it could have done so. It was,
therefore, competent for the Commissioner to correct the
return for 1917, to conform it to the system of accounting
in fact adopted, by excluding from it the munitions tax
which had accrued in 1916, whether appearing on the
books for that year or not." United States v. American

Separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE

McREYNOLbS

and MR.

JUSTICE BUTLER.

In our view the decree below should be reversed. This
Court has often affirmed: "In the interpretation of statutes levying taxes it is the established rule not to extend
their provisions, by implication, beyond the clear import
of the language used, or to enlarge their operations so as
to embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case
of doubt they are construed most strongly against the
Government, and in favor of the citizen." Gould v. Gould,::
245 U. S. 151, 153. Crocker v. 3.illey, 249 'U. S. 223,
233; United States v..Field, 255 U. S. 257, 2621iSmieta ka

Reinecke.v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. $. 339, 348.
. We think it impossible properly to say that the statute
under consideration, by clear import, laid the questioned
tax. The petitioner made its return after the mode long
approved by the Treasury Department and distinctly disavowed any purpose to accept the option granted by section 13 (d). Under ai interpretation, certainly not free
from grave doubt, a"taxpayer who honestly sought to do
what capable counsel well might have advised, has been
heavily burdened.
United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, differs materially from the present cause upon the facts and, we
think, is not enough to support the conclusion of the court
below.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND, concurring.

am bound to follow it in similar cases; and in principle,
I think, it controls here. It is true that there are differences in matters of fact between the present case and that
case, but they seem to me not to be of a character to affect
the pertinence of the Anderson decision and call for the
application of a different rule. For that reason alone I
concur in the opinion of the court just annpunced. Were
it not for the Anderson case I should join in the dissent.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
'THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 15.

Argued October 21, 1930.-Decided November,24, 1930.

1. In §§ 210 (a) and 211 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which lay
a tax upon the "net income of every individual," the use of the
word "of" denotes ownership and, in the absence of further definition by Congress, a broader significance should not be imputed
to the phrase. P. 109.
2. The question whether the interest of a wife in community income
amounts to ownership, and is therefore taxable and returnable
under the Revenue Act of 1926 apart from the interest of the
husband, is to be determined by the state law of community
property. P. 110.
3. By the law of the State of Washington, the wife has a vested
property right, equal to that of her husband, in the community
property and in the income of the community, including salaries
or wages of either husband or wife, or both. P. 111.
4. Although, by the Washington law, the husband has broad power
of control with limited accountability to the wife, this power is
conferred on him as agent of the community; it does not make
him the owner of all the community property and income, nor
negative the wife's present interest therein as equal co-owner.
