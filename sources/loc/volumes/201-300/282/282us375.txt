MR. JusTIcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The same Circuit Court of Appeals which certified questions in White v. Johnson, ante, p. 367, also certified six
questions in this case. While they are differently phrased,
they are in substance the same.
Here a suit in equity was brought by the United States
to restrain the proprietor of a broadcasting station from
disregarding an order of the Federal Radio Commission,
revoking its license, and from operating in defiance of the
provisions of the Radio Act. As in the other case, the
appellants admittedly failed to avail themselves of the
right of appeal afforded by the Act.
The reasons stated in the White case for not answering
the questions therein certified apply here.
The certificate is dismissed.

2. In accordance with Article 845 of Treasury Regulations 45, applicable to the Revenue'Act of 1918, and which provides that "federal income .. .taxes are deemed to have been paid out of the

net income -of the taxable year for which they, are levied," the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined. that the invested
capital for 1919 of a corporate taxpayer which kept its books
and made returns on the accrual basis, should be reduced, in its
return for the taxable year 1919, by the amount *of income and
excess profits taxes for 19.8, as of the dates in 1919 when the
instalments of taxes fell due and were paid. This computation
resulted in an alleged overpayment of excess profits taxes which
the taxpayer sued to recover. Held:
(1) The regulation was reasonable and consistent with the Act
of 1918. P. 378.
(2) In view of the facts that the Act 6f 1917 required the payment of the same sort of taxes; that the petitioner actually accrued
its taxes for 1918 and set them up in a reserve at the end of the
year; that taxpayers understood that the policy of the Government
with respect to income and excess profits taxes was continuous;
and that a Treasury Decision, in substance the same as Article
845, was applicable to the 1917 Act, the regulation was not unreasonable as applied to 1918 taxes, notwithstanding that the Revenue
Act of 1918 was not passed until February, 1919, and the taxpayer
could not know at the close of 1918 what the exact amount of,
its taxes for that year would be.- P. 379.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Certiorari was granted to the Court of Claims to review
a judgment in favor of the United States in an action to
recover an alleged overpayment of excess profits tax for
the calendar year 1919. The petitioner, a corporation,
kept its books and made its returns of income and excess
profits taxes on the accrual basis. In its return for the
year ended December 31, 1919, it did not deduct from
invested capital any amount on account of income and
excess profits taxes for 1918 assessed and paid in 1919.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined
that the invested capital for 1919 should be reduced by
the amount of income and profits taxes for 1918, as of the
dates in 1919 when the instalments of taxes fell due and
were paid. To accomplish this he computed an average
deduction for the year 1919, and diminished the earned
surplus as of January 1, 1919, by subtracting from it the
amount so ascertained.
The Commissioner's action was in accordance with Article 845 of Treasury Regulations 45, promulgated April
17, 1919, applicable to the Revenue Act of 1918. The
pertinent portion follows:
"federal income . . . taxes are deemed to have
been paid out of the net income of the taxable year for
which they are levied."
Section 326 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provided
that "as used in this title the term 'invested capital'
. :
for any year means .
(1) Actual cash bona fide paid in for stock or shares;
(2) Actual cash value of tangible property, other than
. ;
cash, bona fide paid in for stock or shares,
(3) Paid-in or earned surplus and undivided profits;
not including surplus and undivided profits earned during
the year;"

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

Petitioner asserts that Article 845 was based on the erroneous assumption that income taxes are payable out of
the net income of the taxable year for which they are
levied.
The United States replies that it is, and since 1914 it
has been, required- that a taxpayer shall keep his books
and make his returns on a basis which will *reflect true
incbme; that while the taxes for any year are not payable
until the following year, good accounting practice requires
an accrual of them as a liability of the current year's
business; and that the regulation in question was not
only reasonable, but necessary for proper administration
of the Revenue Act.
The position of the Government is sound. A corporation cannot claim to have accumulated any net income in
any year until provision is made for taxes accrued, based
on net income for the same year.
The reasonableness of the regulation is further shown
by the fact that "invested capital" was merely a legislative definition of an element in the formula prescribed
for computation of excess profits tax. Congress might
have expressly declared that taxes should be excluded
from invested capital. It did not do so in ยง 326 (a), or
elsewhere in the act. The regulations were made pursuant to express authority (see ยง 1309 of the Revenue Act
of, 1918). They are valid unless unreasonable or inconsistent with the statute. United States v. Grimaud, 220
U. S. 506, 517-518; International Ry. Co. v. Davidson,
257 U. S. 506, 514. They- constitute- contemporaneous
construction by those charged with the administration
of the act, are for that reason entitled to respectful consideration, and will not be overruled except for weighty
reasons. United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760, 763;
Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 336.
Petitioner -insists that Article 845 is unreasonable as
applied to 1918 taxes; that no one could know what those
taxes would be at the close of the year, because the so-

called-Revenue Act of 1918 was not.passed until February, 1919, and made changes in the rates. But the 1917
act was in force, and required the payment of the same
sort of taxes, and petitioner concedes it accrued its taxes
for 191-8 and set them up in a reserve at the end of the
year. The Act of 1918 was retroactive and replaced the
prior act of.October 3, 1917, and taxpayers understood that
the policy of the United States with respect to income
and profits tax was continuous. In February, 1919, the
Treasury promulgated Decision 2791, applicable to the
1917 Act, and in substance the same as Article 845, which
was issued under the 1918 Act on April 17, 1919. The
taxes in question were provided for by an act passed in
February, 1919, but they were for the year 1918. The act
was passed in ample time to allow the taxpayer to readjust its accounts for that year by including these taxes;
and, since its books were kept on an accrual basis, it was
necessary that this should be done in order clearly to
reflect the income for 1918.
United States v. Woodward, 256 U. S. 632, on which
petitioner relies, is clearly distinguishable on the grounds
stated in United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 441.
We cannot hold that the regulation on which the Commissioner relied was unreasonable or in conflict with the
provisions of the statute. The judgment is
Affirmed.
