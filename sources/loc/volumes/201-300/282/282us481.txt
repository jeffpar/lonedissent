CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 39. Argued December 12, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1931.
1. When the United States expropriates the property of an alien friend,
the Fifth Amendment requires that it pay just compensation equivalent to the full value of the property contemporaneously with the
taking. P. 489.
2. This constitutional right of the alien does not depend upon whether
the government of his country renders compensation to our citizens
in like cases or upon whether that government is recognized as such
by our own. P. 491.

3. The Act of June 15, 1917, which -provided for war-time expropriation of ships, etc., and for payment of just compensation, epressly
entitling the property owner, if dissatisfied with the amount fixed
by the President, to accept 75% thereof and to sue the United
States in the Court of Claims under Jud. Code § 145, for such further sum as will make up just compensation, should not be construed as limited, with respect to alien suitors,, by Jud. Code § 155,
which provides that "Aliens who are citizens or subjects of any
government which accords to citizens of the United States the right
to prcsecute claims against such government in its courts, shall have
the privilege of prosecuting claims against the United States in the
Court of Claims, whereof such coirt, by reason of their subject

Court of Claims rejecting a claim for want of jurisdiction.
Mr. William L. Rawls, with whom Messrs. Charles
Recht, Horace S. Whitman, William L.'Marbury, Jr., and
Osmond K. Fraenkelwere on thebrief, for petitioner.
The petitioner is a juristic person with capacity to sue.
The United States dealt with it as a legal entity and as
owner of the property. Just compensation to it was fixed
under the order of August 31, 1917. Since that time the
United States Government has had numerals, dealings.
with the Russian Volunteer Fleet as such and has evei
brought suit agiinst the corporation. See United Sl'ates
v. Russian,Volunteer Fleet, 22 F. (2d) 187.
The Department of State still recognizes the representative of the Provisional Russian Government as the accredited r presentative of the State of Russia.
But the overthrow of a Government does not carry with
itthe extinction of private rights, Vilas v. Manila, 220
U.'S. 345, nor destroy the State. The continued existenc*e
of the State of Russia has been clearly recognized in
Russian Government v. Lehigh VaIley R. Co., 293 Fed.

Petitioner has alleged its continued existence as a corporation under the laws of the Soviet Government, but

purpose of bringing suit to collect its assets would be

by our Government of the validity of the decrees of the
Soviet Government. Petrogradsky W. K. Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N. Y. 23; Russian C. & I. Bank v.

150, (1923) 2 K. B. 682.
Even though no payment has been made to petitioner,
the Act of June 15, 1917, is broad enough to cover this
case. Similar suits have been entertained. United States
v. Carver, 278 U. S. .294; Seaboard Air Line v. United
States, 261 U. S. 299; Houston Coal Co. v. United States,
262 U. S. 361; United States v. McNeil & Sons, 267 U. S.
302.
The Act of 1917 must be so construed as to harmonize
with the Fifth Amendment. If so construed ag to deny
just compensation to persons whose property is taken
under it, it would be unconstitutional. Brooks-Scanlon
Corp. v. United States, 265 U. S. 106; Seaboard Air Line

The case is governed by Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v.
United States, 275 U. S. 331.
Limitations expressing broad purposes contained in
general Acts enacted many years ago, should not be read
into special war legislation in such a manner as to limit
its remedial character. United States v. Pfitsch,256 U. S.

fore conferred upon dliens, and is not an enabling Act
as'the Court of Claims seems to have supposed. Section
155 does not limit the right to sue the United States to
,citizens of recognized governments. Its history makes
clear that the Act did not confer special privileges on
aliens, but took away from certain classes privileges which
had theretofore been conferred upon them.
The decisions of this Court have condemned the practice

If petitioner's right is dependent upon § 155 df the
Judicial Code, petitioner should be permittel to establish
as a matter of fact that the present Russian Government
allows suits to be brought against it by citizen of the
United States.
A judicial determination that there was in fact a. Govemnment in Russia known as the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, and that such government as a matter of fact
carried on the ordinary functions of any civilized goveimment, is not in the leist an infringement upon the prerogatives of the Department of State. United States v.

Attorney General Rugg and Messrs. Percy M. Cox, Erwin
N. Griswold, H. Brian Holland, Green H. Hackworth,
Solicitor, Department of State, and FrancisM. Anderson,
Assistant Solicitor, were on the brief, for the United States.
The Govern'ment submits the case on the opinion of the
Court of Claims. Although we do not confess error, we
are of the opinion that § 155 of the Judicial Code is not
applicable. The Act of June 15, 1917, does not mention
§ 155, and we think it doubtful whether Congress intended
to make the right to sue dependent upon the conditions
set forth in § 155. A case involving other statutes relating to suits in the Court of Claims supports the contention that § 155 is not applicable. Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331.
Moreover, there would seem to be grave doubt as to
the constitutionality of the Act of June 15, 1917, as construed b- the Court of Claims.
If § 155 of the Judicial Code is applicable, we submit
that the decision of the Court of Claims was correct. This
Government has not recognized any r6gime which has been
functioning as a Government in Russia since 1917. It
follows that if the petitioner is a citizen of Russia, it is not
a citizen "of any Government" within the meaniing of

486

OCT0.BER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

§ 155, and that the courts in this country can not find that
judicial remedies against the Russian Government exist in
Russia.
A further question may be suggested, and that is whether
a corporation which purports to be acitizen of " the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics" has such a legal existence
as to bring suit in any court. But we are of the opinion
that this question is not now before this Court. The
petition filed in the Court of Claims describes the petitioner as a corporation "duly organized under, and by
virtue of, the Laws of Russia." As the record avers facts
showing that it was in existence under the regime of the
"Imperial Russian Government, it can not be assumed
without proof that it now has no corporate existence. A
recent well-considered case held that such a corporation
may bring suits in the courts in this country. Petrogradsky M. K. Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N. Y. 23.
The mere statement that the petitioner is a citizen of "th6
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," in its brief, which is
not a part of the record, would hardly seem to be sufficient ground for dismissing the case. Whether any corporation created by this so-called Republic can sue is a
question which requires more information about the subject than can be obtained either from this record or
judicial notice of political acts. Similarly, the question
whether the suit is being prosecuted by persons having
proper authority from the corporation, alleged to be entitled to compensation, is a matter which can not be
determined at the present time.
MR.CHIEF JusTIcE HUGHES delivered 'the opinion of
the Court.

delegated to it by the President, of contracts for the construction of two vessels. The Court of Claims dismissed
the petition for the want of jurisdiction. 68 Ct. Cls. 32.
This Court granted a writ of 'certiorari. 281 U. S. 711.
The petition, filed in October, 1924, alleged that the
petitioner "is a corporation duly organized under, and by
virtue of, the Laws of Russia "; that in Janlary, 1917, the
petitioner became the assignee for value of certain contracts for the construction of two vessels by the Standard
Shipbuilding Corporation of New York; that in August,
1917, the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet
Corporation, acting under the authority conferred by the
Act of June 15, 1917 (c. 29, 40 Stat. 183) and by the Executive Order of the President of the United States made
on July 11, 1917, requisitioned these contracts, and the
vessels being constructed thereunder, for the use of the
United States; that the United States thereb became
liable to the petitioner for the payment of just compensation; that in August, 1919, the petitioner submitted its
affidavit of claim, and vouchers in support; that in March,
1920, the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet
Corporation fixed the just compensation of the petitioner
at a total amount of $1,412,532.35; that the value of the
contracts taken from the petitioner was $4,000,000, to!
which the petitioner was entitled after allowing all proper
credits and offsets; and that" citizens of the United States
are and at the time of and since the commencement of
this suit have been accorded the right to prosecute claims
against the Russian Government in the Court of that
Government."
In May, 1927, the petitioner filed motions to issue commissions to take testimony in Germany and France; the
defendant objected, and the motions 'were overruled.
The petitioner then gave notice of the taking of testimony in Washington, D. C., whereupon the defendant
moved to quash the notice upon the ground that the

Court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter of
the proceeding. On the submission of that motion, the
petition was dismissed. The Court of Claims held that,
as the United States Government had not recognized the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Russia, the petitioner was not entitled to maintain its suit in view of
section 155 of the Judicial Code (U. S. C., Tit. 28; § 261).
That section is as follows: "Sec. 155. Aliens who are
citizens or subjects of any government which accords to
citizens of the United States the right to prosecute
claims against such government in its courts, shall have
the privilege of prosecuting claims against the United
States in the Court of Claims, whereof such court, by
reason of their subject matter and character, might take
jurisdiction." The court said that the reference to citizens or subjects of "any government" meant such governments as were recognized by the proper authorities
of the United States.
The Government in its argument here, while submitting
the case on the opinion of the Court of Claims and not confessing error, presents the view that section 155 of the Judicial Code does not apply to this suit, which was brought
under the provisions of the Act of June 15, 1917. With
respect to the matter of recognition, the Government
appends to its brief a letter of the Secretary of State of
the United States, under date of December 5, 1930, stating
that "the Provisional Government of Russia, the successor of the Imperial Government of Russia, was recognized by the Government of the United States on March
22, 1917"; that, "according to the Department's information, the Provisional Government of Russia was overthrown by an armed uprising which took place in the early
part of November, 1917," and that "the Government of
the United States has not extended recognition to any
regime established in Russia subsequent to the overthrow
of the Provisional Government."

481

Opinion of the Court.

As the facts alleged in the petition were admitted by
the motion to dismiss, the allegation that the petitioner
is a corporation duly organized under the laws-of Russia
stands unchallenged on the record. There was n6 legislation which prevented it from acquiring and holding the
property in question. The petitioner was an alien friend,
and as such was entitled to the protection of the Fifth
Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Wong Wing v.
United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238; compare Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369; Santa Clara County y. Southern PacificR. Co., 118 U. S. 394, 396; Truax v. Raich, 239
U. S. 33, 39; Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197, 216;
Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, 411. E5kerting by its authorized agent the power of eminent domain
in taking the petitioner's property, the United States became bound to pay just compensation. United States v.
Great FallsMfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656; United States v.
North American Co., 253 U. S. 330, 333; Campbell v.

States, 274 U. S. 341, 343, 344; InternationalPaper Co. v.
United States, ante, p. 399. And this obligation was to
pay to the petitioner the equivalent of the full value of
the property contemporaneously with the taking. Phelps
v. United States, supra; Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United
States, 265 U. S. 106, 123.
The Congress recognized this duty in authorizing .the
expropriation. The Act of June 15, 1917, under which
the requisition was made, provided for the payment of
just compensation. The Congress did not attempt to
give to any officer or administrative tribunal the final
authority to determine the amount of such compensation1, and recovery by suit against the United States was

made an integral part of the legislative plan of fulfilling
the constitutional requirement. The Act provided as follows: "Whenever the United States shall . . requisition any contract, . . . requisition, acquire or take
over . . . any ship, . . . in accordance with the provisions hereof, it shall make just compensation therefor,
to be determined by the President; and if the amount
thereof, so determinqd by the President, is unsatisfactory
to the person entitled to receive the same, such person
shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so
determined by the President aud shall be entitled to sue
the United States to recover such further sum as, added
to said seventy-five per centum, will make up such amount
as will be just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and
section one hundred and forty-fiige of the Judicial Code."
Section 24, paragraph 20, of the Judicial Code, U. S. C.,
Tit. 28, § 41, subd. (20), gives jurisdiction to the District
Courts of the United States, concurrent with the Court
of Claims, of claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000, founded upon the Constitution, or any
law of Congress, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, when
the claimant would be entitled to redress against the
United States in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if
the United States were suable. The case of, an alien
friend is not excepted. Section 145 of the Judicial Code
(U.- S. C., Tit. 28, § 250) gives to the Court of Claims
jurisdiction of suits on similar claims against the United
States without limit of amount. The authority concock, 250 U. S. 328, 331; Bragg v. Weaver, 251 U. S. 57, 59; Seaboard

. Opinion of the Court.

ferred upon the President by the Act of June 15, 1917,
was exercised by him through the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, and as the
compensation fixed by that Corporation was not satisfactory to the petitioner, it became entitled under the express
terms of the Act to bring suit against the United States
to recover the amount justly payable by reason of the
requisition.
The Act of June 15, 1917, makes no reference to section 155 of the Judicial Code with respect to alien suitors,
and the question is whether that provision should be implied as establishing a condition precedent and the recovery thus be defeated. It is at once apparent that-such
an implication would lead to anomalous results. It
would mean that, although the United States had actually
taken possession of the property and was enjoying the advantages of its use, and the alien owner was unquestionably entitled to compensation at the time of the taking,
it was the intention of the Congress that recovery should
be denied, or at least be indefinitely postponed until the
Congress made some other provision for the determination of the amount payable, if it appeared that citizens of
the United States were not entitled to prosecute claims
against the government of the alien's country in its courts,
or that the United States did not recognize the regime
which was functioning in that country.
We find no warrant for imputing to the Congress such
in intention. "Acts of Congress are to be construed and
applied in harmony with and not to thwart the purpose
of the Constitution." Phelps v. United States, supra.
*The Fifth Amendment gives to each owner of property
his individual right. The constitutional right of owner
A to compensation when his property is taken is irrespective of what may be done somewhere else with the property of owner B. As alien friends are embraced within

the terms of the Fifth Amendment, it cannot be said that
their property is subject to confiscation here because the
property of our citizens may be confiscated in the alien's
country. The provision that private property shall not
be taken for public use without just compensation establishes a standard for our Government which the Constitution does not make dependent upon the standards of
other governments. The Act of Congresg-should be interpreted in the light of its manifest purpose to give effect
to the constitutional guaranty.
Nor do we regard it as an admissible construction of the
Act of June 15, 1917, to hold that the Congress intended
that the right of an alien friend to recover just compensation should be defeated or postponed because of the lack
of recognition by the Government of the United States of
the r6gime in his country. A fortiori,as the right to compensation for which the Act provided sprang into existence
at the -time -of the taking, there is no ground for saying
that the statute was not to apply, if at a later date, and
before compensation was actually made, there should be a
revolution in the country of the owner and the ensuing
r6gime should not.be recognized. The question as presented here is not one of a claim advanced by or on behalf
of a foreign government or r6gime, but is simply one of
compensating an owner of property taken by the United
tates. '
The Act of June 15, 1917, if read according to its terms,
)resents no difficulty. A condition should hot be implied
vhich, to say the least, would raise, a grave question as
o the constitutional validity of the Act. Federal Trade
