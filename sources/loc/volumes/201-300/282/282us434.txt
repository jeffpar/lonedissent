section 9 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463, 39 Stat.
756, 763). The Court of Claims held that, the assessment
was valid under the provisions of section 250 (d) of the
Act of 1921 (Act of November 23, 1921, c! 136, 42 Stat.
227, 265). We think the court was right in construing
this statute as applicable to the assessment, although previously made, and hence that the tax was assessed
"within the period of limitation properly.,-applicable
thereto," as required by section 611 of the Revenue Act
of 1928.
The petitioner also insists that his claim in abatement
was illegal under section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1921. We do not find that there was any statutory prohibition of the filing of a claim in abatement in the circumstances here shown. The taxpayer benefited by the
claim and is not in a position to contest its legality.
Compare United States v. The John Barth Company, 279
-U. S.370, 376; lorsheim Brothers Dry Goods Company,
Limited, v.' United States, 280 U. S. 453, 464. The case
falls within section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 and
this precludes recovery.

expiration of the statutory period of limitation. The
Government resists recovery under section 611 of the
Revenue Act of 1928 (c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875). In No.

Government was successful. 42 Fed. (2d) 309. In No.

Fed. (2d) 886, and in No. 508, Heiner, Collector of Internal Revenue, v. Erie Coal & Coke Company, 42 Fed. (2d)
214, the decisions below were in favor of the plaintiffs.
This Court granted writs of certiorari.
In No. 400, Mascot Oil Company, Inc. v. United States,
the taxpayer had made a deposit in escrow with a bank
to cover the amount of the tax, but, when the collector
demanded payment, it was made by the taxpayer under
-protest and not from the deposit. In No. 608, Heiner,
Collectorof Internal'Revenue, v. Erie Coal-& Coke Company, a bond had been given to secure payment of the
* tax. The making of the deposit in the former case, and
the giving of the bond in the latter, were after the statute
of limitations had run, but the taxpayer in each case
insists that the statute had not thereby been waived.
We may lay that question aside, for if there was no
waiver thee two cases, together with No. 416, United
States v. Wyman, Partridge & Company, involved the
same circumstances as those decided this day in Graham
-v. Goodcell, ante, p. 409, save that collections were made
while iection 1106 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27,
44 Stat. 9, 113) was in force.1 That section was repealed,
iThis section provided: "See. 1106 (a). The bar of the statute of
limitations against the United States Jn respect of any internalrevenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability; but no credit or refund in respect of such tax
shall be allowed unless the taxpayer has overpaid the tax. The bar
of the statute of limitations against the taxpayer in respect of any
internal-revenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but
shall extinguish the liability; but no collection in respect of such tax
shall be made unless the taxpayer has underpaid the tax."

as of the date of its passage, by section 612 of the Revenue
Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 875). It is nbt necessary to attempt
to resolve the questions raised by the ambiguous language
-of this section, as we are of the opinion that, from any
point of view, it does not protect the taxpayers from the
operation of section 611 of the Revenue Act of '1928.
At the time the taxes were collected, there was no liability
on the part of the taxpayers, but this was also true in
the case of the petitioners in Graham v. Goodcell, supra.
The Congress ,had constitutional authority in'
the circumstances set forth in section 611 of the Revenue Act of
1928 to cure the defect in administration which had
resulted in. the collection of the tax after the statute of
limitations had run and to deny recovery to-the taxpayers
for the amount paid. The fact that section 1106 (a) of
the Revenue Act of 1926 was in effect at the time of the
collection is a distinction which does not affect the result.
