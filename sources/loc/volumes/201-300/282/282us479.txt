MR. JusTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the'

Court.
United States v. Swift & Company, ante, p. 468, controls the decision of this case.
Here the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, upon
audit of petitioner's income and excess-profits tax return
for 1918, found an overpayment, and at the same time
found an underpayment of similar taxes for the years
1916 and 1917. On January 22, 1926, he made,additional
assessments of the underpayments for 1916 and 1017,

and on January 29 he approved a schedule of overassessments which embraced the overpayment for the year
1918. The schedule was transmitted to the Collector of
the appropriate district with the usual instructions and
authority to check the overassessment against the taxpayer's account and determine whether the amounts in
which the tax liability had been reduced should be abated
in whole or in part, and if any part of the overassessment
was found to be an overpayment to apply the same
against taxes due, if any; making the appropriate enti'y
in his accounts.
After this had occurred, petitioner inquired in writing
of the Collector as to the status of its account. He replied by letter dated February 23, 1926, stating thaf he
had applied the overassessment to close out the accounts
of 1916 and 1917, thus extinguishing the taxpayer's liability as shown by his books. On February 27, 1926, he
returned the schedule of overassessments to the Commissioner together with the usual subsidiary schedule of
credits and refunds showing how he had credited the overassessment and -that there remained a balance of 1918
taxes refundable to the taxpayer amounting to $21,152.12.
On April 15, 1926, the Commissioner approved the schedule, thus authorizing the issuance of checks coverink the
amount to be refunded.
The question is whether interest should be allowed the
petitioner under ยง 1019 of'the Revenue Act of 1924 (43
Stat. 346) or under ยง 1116 of the Revenue Act of,1926
(44 Stat. 119). The latter act took effect February 26,
1926. The Court of Claims held that the act of the Commissioner in approving the schedule of refunds and credits
and authorizing the issuance of checks on April 15, 1926,
constituted the allowance of the claim for credit, and that
interest on credits for 1916 and 1917 taxes should be calculated under the Act of 1926, which had then become
effective. The petitioner argues that credit was allowed

or taken when the Collector, prior to February 26, 1926,
made the. entries upon his books, and that consequently
interest on the credits 'should be calculated under the provisions of the Act of 1924. We hold, in conformity with
our decision in United States v. Swift & Co.; supra,
that the allowance occurred April. 15, 1926, when the
Commissioner finally acted on the schedule of refunds and
credits. The judgment is
Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 39. Argued December 12, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1931.
1. When the United States expropriates the property of an alien friend,
the Fifth Amendment requires that it pay just compensation equivalent to the full value of the property contemporaneously with the
taking. P. 489.
2. This constitutional right of the alien does not depend upon whether
the government of his country renders compensation to our citizens
in like cases or upon whether that government is recognized as such
by our own. P. 491.
Z
3. The Act of June 15, 1917, which -provided for war-time expropriation of ships, etc., and for payment of just compensation, epressly
entitling the property owner, if dissatisfied with the amount fixed
by the President, to accept 75% thereof and to sue the United
States in the Court of Claims under Jud. Code ยง 145, for such further sum as will make up just compensation, should not be construed as limited, with respect to alien suitors,, by Jud. Code ยง 155,
which provides that "Aliens who are citizens or subjects of any
government which accords to citizens of the United States the right
to prcsecute claims against such government in its courts, shall have
the privilege of prosecuting claims against the United States in the
Court of Claims, whereof such coirt, by reason of their subject
matter and character, might take jurisdiction."
