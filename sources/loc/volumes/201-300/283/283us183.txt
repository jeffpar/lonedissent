others. Its findings are without adequate support in the
evidence. The bill should have been dismissed.
The Government now seeks no relief against the secondary defendants. It concedes that fifty-three of the
seventy-nine contracts, originally set out in the petition,
are wholly beyond attack, because they are licenses issued
to secondary defendants prior to the execution by their
licensors of the three main agreements challenged. As to
the remaining contracts between primary and secondary
defendants, the Government on this appeal agreed that
the decree should be modified to declare such contracts
voidable at the option of the licensees. This modification
was assented to at the bar by counsel for the primary
defendants. But as we are of the opinion that the decree
should be reversed and the bill dismissed, we see no occasion for interfering with the present license arrangements.

LINDSEY, COUNTY COURT CLERK.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE.

No. 358. Argued March 19, 1931.--Decided April 13, 1931.
1. A state tax upon the operation of motor vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, being a direct burden on that
commerce, can not be sustained unless it appears affirmatively, in
some way, that it is levied only as compensation for use of the
highways in the State or to defray the expense of regulating motor
traffic. P. 185.
2. Tennessee Act of 1927, c. 89, § 4, imposed upon concerns operating
interstate motor buses on the highways of the State a privilege tax
graduated according to carrying capacity. It is part of a general
revenue act which deals with practically all of the taxes laid by
the State, except taose which admittedly provide for defraying

APPEAL from a judgment reversing a judgment for the
Transit Company in a lower state court, in its action to
recover money collected from it as a tax.
Messrs. J. Carlton Loser and Thomas L. Tallentire,with
whom Messrs. H. Lynne Barber and J. G. Lackey were on
the brief, for appellant.
Mr. William F. Barry, Jr., argued the cause, and Messrs.
L. D. Smith, Attorney General of Tennessee, and Roy H.
Beeler, Solicitor General, submitted a brief for appellee.
A State may impose, even on motor vehicles engaged
exclusively in interstate commerce, a reasonable charge as
their fair contribution to the cost of construction and
maintenance of the public highways. Sprout v. South
Bend, 277 U. S. 170; Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S. 610,
622; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, 276 U. S. 245;

Transit Co. v. Marshall,8 F. (2d) 635; Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183.
Since the highways over which appellant operates are
properly maintained by the State out of adequate funds
made available for that purpose, the appellant cannot
complain that the tax is not levied for the specific benefit
of the state highway system.
The exaction is reasonable in amount and not incommensurate with the use to which the appellant puts the
highways.

Opinion of the Court.

That the tax appears in the "Revenue Bill" does not
make it unlawful. Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279
U. S. 625.
In the absence of statutory enactment by the Federal
Government to regulate and tax interstate motor carriers
operating for hire, each State may tax and regulate such
operations. Morris v. Duby, 274 U. S. 135.
There is no discrimination in the statute against interstate operators in favor of intrastate operators.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Tennessee Act of 1927, c. 89, § 4, imposes upon
concerns operating interstate motor busses on the highways of the State a privilege tax graduated according to
carrying capacity. It is $500 a year for each vehicle seating more than twenty and less than thirty passengers.
The tax for eight such busses was demanded of Interstate
Transit, Inc., an Ohio corporation which operates, exclusively in interstate commerce, a line from Cincinnati,
Ohio, to Atlanta, Georgia. The company made a quarterly payment under protest and brought this suit to
recover the amount paid, on the ground that the statute
as applied violates the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution. The trial court allowed recovery, but its
judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the State.
161 Tenn. 56; 29 S. W. (2d) 257. The case is here on
appeal.
While a State may not lay a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, Sprout v. South Bend, 277
U. S. 163, it may impose even upon motor vehicles engaged
exclusively in interstate commerce a charge, as compensation for the use of the public highways, which is a fair
contribution to the cost of constructing and maintaining
them and of regulating the traffic thereon. Kane v. New
Jersey, 242 U. S. 160, 168-169; Clark v. Poor, 274 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

554; Sprout v. South Bend, supra, pp. 169-170. As such
a charge is a direct burden on interstate commerce, the tax
cannot be sustained unless it appears affirmatively, in
some way, that it is levied only as compensation for use
of the highways or to defray the expense of regulating
motor traffic. This may be indicated by the nature of
the imposition, such as a mileage tax directly proportioned
to the use, Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, 276 U. S.
245, or by the express allocation of the proceeds of the
tax to highway purposes, as in Clark v. Poor, supra,' or
otherwise. Where it is shown that the tax is so imposed,
it will be sustained unless the taxpayer shows that it
bears no reasonable relation to the privilege of using the
highways or is discriminatory. Hendrick v. Maryland, 235
U. S. 610, 612; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, 276
U. S. 245, 250-252. Compare Interstate Busses Corp. v.
Holyoke Street Ry., 273 U. S. 45, 51. But the mere fact
that the tax falls upon one who uses the highway is not
enough to give it presumptive validity.
A detailed examination of the statute under which the
tax here challenged was laid makes it clear that the charge
was imposed not as compensation for the use of the highways but for the privilege of doing the interstate bus
business. Chapter 89 of the Acts of 1927 deals with practically all of the taxes laid by the State, except those relating to highways. It is entitled "An Act to provide for
General Revenue for the State of Tennessee and the
counties and municipalities thereof, to be known as the
General Revenue Bill." The scope of this statute conforms to the title. It consists of twenty-one sections.
1 The Ohio statute there involved declared that the taxes were laid,
and were to be used only for, the maintenance and repair of highways and for the regulation of motor traffic. Ohio General Code,
§ 614-94, § 614-96. The "other purposes," referred to in the
opinion, 274 U. S. at p. 557, were the general expenses of the state
motor vehicle department as distinguished from expenditures specifically upon the highways.

INTERSTATE TRANSIT, INC., v. LINDSEY. 187
183

Opinion of the Court.

The first three impose general property, inheritance, and
merchants' capital taxes. Section 4, under which the tax
challenged is laid, declares "That each vocation, occupation and business hereinafter named in this section is
hereby declared to be a privilege, and the rate of taxes on
such privileges shall be as hereinafter fixed." Then follows a schedule occupying 53 pages, in which 160 businesses are arranged, in the main, alphabetically, and in
which the several motor bus businesses have their appropriate places. This is followed by six additional sections
which deal exclusively with similar privilege taxes. The
remaining sections relate to enforcement.
The tax on interstate busses is of the same character as
the tax laid for the privilege of engaging in every other
line of business. The taxes for the several businesses
range from $2.50 to $5000; and since they differ widely in
amount even for the same business, appear to be graduated according to the assumed earning capacity. In
most, the amount demanded increases with the population of the city, town, or district in which the business is
carried on. For some a different basis of gauging probable earning power is adopted. On warehouses the tax is
graduated according to storage capacity. On theatres it
is graduated according to seating capacity. On the business of operating busses it likewise varies according to
seating capacity. The latter tax is specified separately
for interstate busses, for intrastate busses operating in
more than one county, and for those operating in a single
county. But this separation appears to be made solely
because of the allocation of the proceeds of the tax.2 For
the rate of taxation is the same for each, and varies solely
with the carrying capacity of the bus; there being steep
Where an intrastate bus operates for more than half of its total
mileage on a county maintained road the Act provides that one-half
of the tax shall be retained by the county for road purposes. But
taxes collected from interstate busses are not so allocated.

increases from $50 a year for one carrying not more than
five passengers to $750 for one carrying over thirty.'
The conclusion that the tax challenged is laid for the
privilege of doing business and not as compensation for
the use of the highways is confirmed by contrasting § 4
of the 1927 Act with those statutes which admittedly
provide for defraying the cost of constructing and maintaining highways and regulating traffic thereon. The former declares specifically in connection with the privilege
tax on interstate busses that the proceeds "shall go and
belong exclusively to the General Funds of the State."
On the other hand, in the legislation by which Tennessee
has provided for defraying the cost of constructing and
maintaining the state highways and regulating motor traffic, it has been the consistent practice to prescribe that
moneys raised for this purpose shall be segregated and go
into the Highway Fund. The present system of motor
regulations was inaugurated in 1915.' At the same session, the legislature created a State Highway Commission
with power to construct and maintain highways.' In

3 Four intermediate classifications are provided: $100 for busses
carrying between five and ten passengers; $200 for one carrying
between ten and fifteen; $350 for one carrying between fifteen and
twenty; and the tax in suit, $500 for a bus carrying between twenty
and thirty passengers.
4In 1915 an annual registration fee based upon seating capacity
was required of all automobile owners. Pub. Acts 1915, c. 8, §§ 1, 5.
In 1917 the fee was made dependent upon rated horsepower, and the
use of the proceeds was limited to administrative expenses of the
motor vehicle department and maintenance of the highways. Pub.
Acts 1917, c. 73, §§ 2, 7. Formal amendments were made in Pub.
Acts 1919, c. 149, § 15; Pub. Acts 1921, c. 131; Pub. Acts 1923, c.
10, § 1; c. 108, § 1; Pub. Acts 1929, c. 14, § 1. A very early Act had
provided for the registration of all motor vehicles at a nominal fee of
two dollars, and had established speed limits. Pub. Acts 1905, c. 173, § 1.
5 Pub. Acts 1915, c. 100, §§ 1-11. This same statute first established a State Highway Fund to be accrued from registration fees and
penalties, and to include federal aid grants. This fund was to be used

these statutes and in many later ones-prescribing additional fees for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles,' imposing gasoline taxes,' laying a one mill road tax,'
and authorizing the issue of bonds for the construction
of highways and bridges,-the legislature provided that
the proceeds of the fees, taxes, and bonds, and of the tolls
collected on bridges, should be set apart as state highway
and bridge funds to be expended by the Commission exclusively for the construction and maintenance of highways or bridges. The absence in § 4 of this provision,
which characterizes almost every other Tennessee statute
relating to the'construction and maintenance of highways
or the regulation of motor vehicle traffic, is additional evidence that the present tax was not exacted for such purposes, but merely as a privilege tax on the carrying on of
interstate business.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

It is suggested that a tax on busses graduated according
to carrying capacity is common and is a reasonable measure of compensation for use of the highways. It is true
that such a measure is often applied in taxing motor
vehicles engaged in intrastate commerce." Being free to
levy occupation taxes, States may tax the privilege of
doing an intrastate bus business without regard to whether
the charge imposed represents merely a fair compensation
for the use of their highways. Compare Gundling v.
Chicago, 177 U. S. 183, 189. But since a State may
demand of one carrying on an interstate bus business only
fair compensation for what it gives, such imposition,
although termed a tax, cannot be tested by standards
which generally determine the validity of taxes. Being
valid only if compensatory, the charge must be necessarily
predicated upon the use made, or to be made, of the highways of the State. Clark v. Poor, supra. In the present
act the amount of the tax is not dependent upon such use.
It does not rise with an increase in mileage travelled, or
even with the number of passengers actually carried on
the highways of the State. Nor is it related to the degree
of wear and tear incident to the use of motor vehicles of
different sizes and weights, except in so far as this is indirectly affected by carrying capacity." The tax is proportioned solely to the earning capacity of the vehicle. Accordingly, there is here no sufficient relation between the
measure employed and the extent or manner of use, to
justify holding that the tax was a charge made merely as
compensation for the use of the highways by interstate
busses. We need not therefore consider whether the tax
exacted from this appellant is unreasonably large or
