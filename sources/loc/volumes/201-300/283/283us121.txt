was precisely that which the court has thus definitely

stated. While, in accordance with proper practice and the
rule of this Court," the Court of Claims should have found
the ultimate fact, and we do not approve the method it
adopted, we are of the opinion that, in view of the findings
of fact actually made and the conclusion they import, the
judgment should be sustained. 8

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

283 U.S.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This is a suit for the infringement of letters patent No.
1,379,224, No. 1,507,440, and No. 1,507,439, relating to
devices for dog races. Judgment in the District Court
dismissing the complaint was affirmed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. 39 F. (2d) 92; 40 F. (2d) 173. This
Court granted a writ of certiorari because of conflict with
a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit. American Electric Rabbit Assn. v. New Orleans
Kennel Club, 26 F. (2d) 1016.
Patent No. 1,379,224 was before this Court in Smith v.
Magic City Kennel Club, 282 U. S. 784. Referring to
the prior art, the Court found that the patentee's improvement was in a limited field. There was no invention in
a combination consisting of a covered rail track, conveyor
car and an arm projecting over the course 'and connected
with a mechanical lure carried before racing dogs. The
patent could be sustained only by virtue of the distinctive
feature of the arm employed. This was described in
claim 1 as "an arm extending through the longitudinal
opening of the casing in a projecting position over the
track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably
mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end
thereof," and, in claim 2, as "a horizontally extending
arm hinged to said car extending midway of said course,
a wheel rotatably mounted near the end of said arm, and
resting upon the ground, a platform supported by said
arm and a lure or quarry mounted upon said platform for
attracting the dogs." The Court reached the conclusion
that a rigid, horizontal arm, without hinge or wheel, was
not the subject of either claim. In this view, the device
of the defendant does not infringe.
Patent No. 1,507,440, relating to "housing for conveyor
cars and tracks," we have held to be invalid for want of
invention. Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, supra.

HANS REES' SONS v. NO. CAROLINA
121

Syllabus.

Patent No. 1,507,439 is for an improvement in starting
cages for racing dogs. The single claim is as follows:
"In a starting cage for racing dogs, a frame comprising
a box-like structure divided into a plurality of compartments and comprising walls formed of wire mesh partially
covered with fabric, individual rear doors for each of the
compartments and a single front door hinged at its upper
end to the top walls of the frame, divergent inclined members secured to the top of the said frame and extending
upwardly and outwardly beyond the face of the front
door and having their outer ends in the plane of the side
walls of the box-like structure, springs secured to the outer
ends of said inclined members and to the door and lying
in the plane of the hinges, and a latch at the bottom of
the cage for coaction with the lower edge of the front
door to hold the front door normally closed against the
tension of said springs, said springs adapted to raise the
front door upon release of the latch."
In the light of the proceedings in the Patent Office upon
the rejection of earlier claims, the claim can have but
a narrow application. We agree with the Circuit Court
of Appeals that the particular sort of spring support and
the wire mesh partitions partially covered with fabric, as
well as the other elements, are but forms of construction
within the range of ordinary mechanical skill. There was
an utter absence of invention justifying the issue of this
patent.
Decree affirmed.
