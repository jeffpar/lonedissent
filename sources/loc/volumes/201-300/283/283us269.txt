to the surviving brothers and sisters, if any, none of whom
is a party to this suit. That question was not decided by
the state court, for the review of whose judgment certiorari was granted, and is not one which can be disposed
of on this record.
While, in such a situation, the writ may be dismissed,
see Kimball v. Kimball, 174 U. S. 158, the present is not a
proper case for such disposition, which might leave the
judgment to be enforced by the respondent administrator
without determination of his rights. In order that the
state court may be free to deal adequately with the questions which must be determined in order to make appropriate distribution of the fund involved, the judgment will
be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion. Missouri ex rel. Wabash Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 273 U. S. 126,

Assistant Attorney General Rugg, with whom Solicitor
General Thacher and Messrs. Claude R. Branch, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, Bradley B. Gilman,
and Ralph C. Williamson were on the brief, for the United
States.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This Court granted certiorari, 281 U. S.719, to review
a judgment of the Court of Claims, allowing recovery by
respondent of income and excess profits taxes alleged to
have been illegally exacted for the year 1917. 69 Ct. Cls.
204; 37 F. (2d) 977. It is conceded that respondent was
entitled to a deduction from gross income for that year on
account of exhaustion or obsolescence of patents, under
§ 203 of the Revenue Act of March 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1001;
§§ 4 and 206 of the Act of October 3, 1917, 40 Stat. 302,
305; § 12 (a) of the Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 767, which, if
allowed, would result in the refund demanded.
The sole objection to recovery urged by the Government is that the claim for refund filed by petitioner as a
prerequisite to suit did not comply with § 1318 of the
Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 314, and Article 1036 of
Treasury Regulations 62, under that Act.
Section 1318 provides that "no suit . . . shall be
maintained in any court for the recovery of any internalrevenue tax alleged to have been . . . illegally ...
collected . . . until a claim for refund or credit has been
duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the
regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury..
Article 1036, Treasury Regulations 62, provides that
claim for refund shall be made on Form 843 and that "all

the facts relied upon in support of the claim should be
clearly set forth under oath."
Respondent filed an application under oath for reduction of its 1917 tax liability and for a corresponding return
of taxes paid, on Form 843, which it designated a claim
"for refund of taxes illegally collected." But the sole
ground stated for the demanded reduction of tax was that
respondent had filed with the Commissioner an application for special relief from the amount of its excess profits
tax under § 210 of the Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 307.1
That section provides for a special method of assessment of excess profits taxes in any case where the Secretary of the Treasury is unable satisfactorily to determine
the invested capital of the taxpayer. It has no relation
to deductions from gross income on account of exhaustion
or obsolescence of patents. In support of its claim, which
was ultimately allowed in part, respondent prepared and
filed a brief, and an oral argument was held in the office
of the Commissioner; but neither in its claim for refund,
its brief, nor at the hearing, was mention made of the
deduction now claimed.
material part of the claim for refund is as follows:
"The taxpayer has filed with the commissioner a claim for special
relief under section 210 of the 1917 revenue act for the excess profits
tax assessed for this period.
"This claim is filed to protect all possible legal rights of the taxpayer, pending, and at the rate of, the settlement of the claim for
relief. Computation has been made as follows:
Total profits taxes paid ....................... $227,789.38
Less: Decrease in income taxes on account of
13,667.37
profits taxes credit .........................
1 The

Refund claimed .......................... $214, 122.01
"The taxpayer requests an oral hearing and the right of appeal
in the event of an adverse decision on the part of the unit and before
any formal rejection of the claim is made."

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The filing of a claim or demand as a prerequisite to a
suit to recover taxes paid is a familiar provision of the
revenue laws, compliance with which may be insisted
upon by the defendant, whether the collector or the
United States. Tucker v. Alexander, 275 U. S. 228;
Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 342,
353, 354; Kings County Savings Institution v. Blair, 116
U. S. 200; Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, 130.
One object of such requirements is to advise the appropriate officials of the demands or claims intended to be
asserted, so as to insure an orderly administration of the
revenue, Nichols v. United States, supra, p. 130, a purpose not accomplished with respect to the present demand by the bare declaration in respondent's claim that
it was filed "to protect all possible legal rights of the
taxpayer." The claim for refund, which § 1318 makes
prerequisite to suit, obviously relates to the claim which
may be asserted by the suit. Hence, quite apart from
the provisions of the Regulation, the statute is not satisfied by the filing of a paper which gives no notice of the
amount or nature of the claim for which the suit is
brought, and refers to no facts upon which it may be
founded.
The Court of Claims, in allowing recovery, relied upon
Tucker v. Alexander, supra, and upon the fact that, at the
time when respondent filed its return and its claim for refund, the Treasury had consistently refused to allow deductions from gross income for exhaustion of patents.
Consequently it held that the filing of a demand which
was certain to be refused was a futile and unnecessary
act. But in Tucker v. Alexander the right of the Government to insist upon compliance with the statutory requirement was emphasized. Only because that right was, recognized was it necessary to decide whether it could be
waived. The Court held that it could, and that in that
case it had been waived by the stipulation of the collector

filed in court. Here there was no compliance with the
statute nor was there a waiver of its condition, since the
Commissioner had no knowledge of the claim and took no
action with respect to it.
The necessity for filing a claim such as the statute requires is not dispensed with because the claim may be
rejected. It is the rejection which makes the suit necessary. An anticipated rejection of the claim, which the
statute contemplates, is not a ground for suspending its
operation. Even though formal, the condition upon
which the consent to suit is given is defined by the words
of the statute, and "they mark the conditions of the claimant's right." Rock Island R. R.v. United States, 254 U. S.
141, 143. Compliance may be dispensed with by waiver,
as an administrative act, Tucker v. Alexander, supra; but
it is not within the judicial province to read out of the
statute the requirement of its words. Rand v. United
States, 249 U. S. 503, 510.
