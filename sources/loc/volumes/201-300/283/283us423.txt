ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA
No. 19, original.

ET AL.

Argued March 9, 10, 1931.-Decided May 1S, 1931.

1. The United States has power to construct a dam across a navigable
river for the purpose of improving navigation, and need not first
obtain approval of its plans by the State in which the dam is to be
located, even though this be expressly required of it by a statute of
the State. P. 451.
2. On a motion to dismiss, equivalent to a demurrer, an allegation in
the bill that a river is not and never has been navigable is not taken
as an admitted fact if the court judicially knows the contrary.
P. 452.
3. Judicial notice taken (from the evidence of history) that a large
part of the Colorado River south of Black Canyon in Arizona was
formerly navigable, and that the main obstacles to navigation have
been the accumulations of silt coming from the upper reaches of the
river system, and the irregularity in the flow due to periods of low
water; and (from reports of Committees of Congress recommending
the project here in question) that, in the opinion of the government
engineers, the silt will be arrested by the dam, and, through use of
the stored water, irregularity in the flow below Black Canyon can be
largely overcome, and navigation for considerable distances both
above and below the dam will become feasible. P. 453.
4. Commercial disuse of a navigable river, resulting from changed
geographical conditions and a Congressional failure to deal with
them, does not amount to an abandonment of it as a navigable river
or prohibit future exertion of federal control over it. P. 454.
5. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, December 21, 1928, authorizes
the Secretary of the Interior, at the expense of the United States,
to construct at Black Canyon on the Colorado River, a dam, a
storage reservoir, and a hydroelectric plant; provides for their
control, management, 'and operation by the United States; and
declares that the authority is conferred "subject to the terms of
the Colorado River Compact," "for the purpose of controlling the
floods, improving navigation and regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored
waters thereof for reclamation of public lands and other beneficial
uses exclusively within the United States, and for the generation
of electrical energy as a means of making the project herein authorized a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking." The
compact referred to is an agreement for the apportionment of the
water of the river and its tributaries, entered into by all the States

in which they flow, except Arizona. The compact declares that
"inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for
commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would
seriously limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters
for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such
waters for domestic, agricultural, and power purposes." The
compact is approved by the Act. This was a suit by Arizona,
against the Secretary of the Interior and the States which made
the compact, to enjoin operations under the Act as invasions of
Arizona's interests in the river and as threatening existing and
future use of the water within her limits, principally for irrigation.
Held:
(1) The Court cannot inquire into the motives of the members
of Congress in passing the Act. P. 455.
(2) As the river is navigable and the means which the Act provides are not unrelated to the control of navigation, the erection and
maintenance of the dam and reservoir are clearly within the powers
conferred upon Congress. Whether the particular structures proposed are reasonably necessary, is not for the Court to determine.
Id.
(3) The fact that purposes other than navigation will also be
served could not invalidate the exercise of the authority conferred
by the Act, even if those other purposes, standing alone, would not
have justified an exercise of Congressional power. Id.
(4) Although the authority conferred by the Act is therein stated
to be "subject to the Colorado River Compact," which instrument
would make the improvement of navigation subservient to all other
purposes, yet the specific statement of primary purpose in the Act
governs the general references to the compact; and the Court may
not assume that Congress had no purpose to aid navigation, and
that itsreal intention was that the stored water shall be so used as
to defeat the declared primary purpose. P. 456.
(5) Possibility. that the power to regulate navigation may be
abused is not an argument against its existence. 457.
(6) There is no occasion to decide whether the authority to construct the dam and reservoir might not also have been constitutionally conferred for the specified purpose of irrigating public lands
of the United States, or for the specified purpose of regulating the
flow and preventing floods in this interstate river; or as a means
of conserving and apportioning its waters among the States
equitably entitled thereto, or for the purpose of performing international obligations. P. 457.

6. In support of the prayer for injunction, Arizona alleges that the
mere existence of the Act will invade her quasi-sovereign rights in
respect of the appropriation of waters within or on her borders;
that the State has great need of further appropriations from the
river for irrigation; that vested rights of appropriation under her
laws can be acquired only by diverting the water and applying
it to beneficial use; that, owing to topographical conditions, this
can only be accomplished through large and costly projects, involving large-scale financing that will be impossible unless it clearly
appear, at or before the time of constructing the requisite works,
that vested rights to permanent use of the water will be acquired;
that actual projects have been planned and approved under the
State's laws which look to appropriation of a large part of the
unappropriated water of the river, and which would irrigate an
immense area in the State, including a large area of state land;
that the needed appropriations will be prevented because, under
the Act, it is proposed to store the entire unappropriated flow at
the dam, and Arizona, and those claiming under her, will not be
permitted to take water from the reservoir, except upon agreeing
that the use shall be subject to the compact, by the terms of which
they will not be entitled to appropriate any water in excess of
that to which there are now perfected rights in Arizona; and that
the Act prevents Arizona, and those claiming under her, from
acquiring necessary rights of way over lands of the United States
for the irrigation of Arizona land, by subjecting such rights to
the compact. Held that there is no ground for an injunction,
because:
(1) The contention is based not upon any actual or threatened
impairment of Arizona's rights but upon assumed potential invasions. P. 462.
(2) The Act does not purport to affect any legal right of the
State or limit, in any way, the exercise of her legal right to appropriate water. Id.
(3) Section 18 of the Act declares that nothing in it "shall be
construed as interfering with such rights as the States now have
either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies
and enact such laws as they may deem necessary with respect to
the appropriation, control, and use of water within their borders,
except as modified " by interstate agreement. As Arizona has made
no such agreement, the Act leaves her legal rights unimpaired. Id.
(4) There is no allegation of definite physical acts of present or
future interference with the exercise of Arizona's right to appropri-

ate water by diversions above the dam, or with enjoyment of water
so appropriated; nor any specific allegation of physical acts impeding exercise of her right to make future appropriations by diversions
below the dam, or limiting enjoyment of rights so acquired, unless it
be by preventing an adequate flow in the river at any necessary
point of diversion. P. 462.
(5) If by operations at the dam, when completed, any then
perfected right of Arizona, or of those claiming under her, should
hereafter be interfered with, appropriate remedies will be available.
P. 463.
(6) There is no threatened physical interference with irrigation
projects approved under the Arizona law, and the Act interposes no
legal inhibition on their execution. Id.
(7) There is no occasion for determining now Arizona's rights to
interstate or local waters which have not yet been, and which may
never be, appropriated. P. 464.
(8) This Court cannot issue declaratory decrees. Id.
(9) Arizona has no constitutional right to use, in aid of appropriation, any land of the United States, and cannot complain
of the provision conditioffing the use of such public land. Id.
(10) The bill' should be dismissed without prejudice to an application for relief in case the stored water is used in such a way
as to interfere with the enjoyment by Arizona, or those claiming
under her, of any rights already perfected or with the right of
Arizona to make additional legal appropriations and to enjoy the
same. Id.

No vested rights of the complainant or of any of her
citizens will be invaded by the execution of the Act.
By their own terms, both the Act and the compact are
subordinated to all such rights; nor is there any interference, actual or threatened, with the right of Arizona,
or her inhabitants, to make appropriation from the unappropriated waters of the Colorado River.
On the contrary, California has agreed to limit the
total appropriations to 4,900,000 acre-feet, leaving 3,600,000 to. satisfy present diversions from the main stream
in Arizona not exceeding 600,000 acre-feet. The balance
of 3,000,000 acre-feet in the main stream thus will remain to satisfy present and future uses in Nevada and
future appropriations in Arizona. If Arizona's contentions are correct, the entire unappropriated flow of the
stream is now and will continue until appropriation
by others to be subject to appropriation by her citizens
without regard to the terms of the compact to which
she is not a party. Until the dam has been built and
the right of the State of Arizona or her citizens to make
appropriations adequate to her existing needs has been
invaded, or is presently threatened, there can be no basis
for relief.
The Act and the compact expressly recognize all existing rights to take water from the Colorado River and
its tributaries.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Argument for Wilbur.

283 U.B.

Where the thread of the river constitutes the boundary
between two States, neither State may reserve to itself
all the water from the stream for future appropriation.
The fact that a neighbor State proposes to divert to
another watershed a portion of the water to which it is
entitled is not material. Such diversions have been recognized as valid by this Court (Wyoming v. Colorado, 259
U. S. 419, 466; and see Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S.
496, 526), and they are so recognized by the six States
parties to the Colorado River Compact.
So far as the United States proposes to divert water
not theretofore appropriated, and to use it for the reclamation and irrigation of public lands, it cannot be restrained
by Arizona within whose borders those lands are situated
and under whose Organic Act such rights were expressly
reserved. United States v. Rio Grande Dam Co., 174
U. S. 690, 703; Enabling Act, c. 310, §§ 20, 28, 36 Stat.
557, 570, 575. The United States may make use of its
property for such purposes regardless of the wishes of
the State. Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 577.
See also Stearns v. Minnesota, 179 U. S. 223, 245; Utah
Power & L. Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 389, 403, 404;
United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54, 55;
Hunt v. United States, 278 U. S. 96, 100.
And so far as Congress orders the erection of structures in a stream for the facilitation of interstate navigation or for flood control of such a stream, it is empowered
to do so by the Constitution. Gibson v. United States,
166 U. S. 269; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co.,
229 U. S. 53; Greenleaf Lumber Co. v. Garrison,237 U. S.
251; Cubbins v. Mississippi River Comm., 241 U. S. 351,
369. See also Sanitary District v. United States, 266
U. S. 405, 426.
Where the land to be protected by flood control is the
property of the United States, Congress undoubtedly has
power to regulate the flow of the stream.

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for Wilbur.

It follows that the complaint, which merely alleges that
the United States and other States in the Colorado River
Basin are proposing to appropriate the unappropriated
waters of the Colorado River Basin to beneficial uses, cannot be sustained when no actual or presently threatened
invasion of any existing or vested right is alleged. Upon
the allegations of the bill it is apparent that this suit begins where the suit brought by Kansas against Colorado
ended-that is, with failure to show any injury, actual or
threatened, which can justify the intervention of a court
of equity. Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 117.
This Court has said repeatedly that it will not consider
merely abstract questions. New York v. Illinois, 274
U. S. 488, 489, 490; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328.
Congress has power under the commerce clause to order
the construction of the dam at Black Canyon.
The navigability of the Colorado between Laguna
Dam and Callville has been repeatedly recognized by
Congress and by territorial and state legislatures. Until
this bill was filed its navigability, so far as we have been
able to ascertain, has never been questioned. The authorities in Arizona prior to the commencement of this
litigation have consistently asserted its navigability.
And so we submit that its navigability below the proposed dam is a matter so notorious as not to require
proof, and to be clearly within the knowledge of the
'Court.
The aid to be given by the dam in improving navigability is obvious. The reservoir will hold back water
during time of flood and will allow an increased minimum
flow at other seasons of the year. The silt which is
flowing along with the water at the present time will be
retained in the reservoir, and the desilted water, flowing
with regularity in the channel of the lower river, will
steadily improve the condition of that channel.

This Court may take judicial notice of the navigability
of the stream. The Montello, 11 Wall. 411, 414; Muller
v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 421; The Planter, 7 Pet. 324,

United States, 267 U. S. 132, 159, 160.
When facts are averred which run counter to facts of
which the Court takes judicial notice, the averments are
disregarded. Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202, 215;
Pearcy v. Stranahan, 205 U. S. 257, 263; Middlesex
Transp. Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 82 N. J.. Eq. 550,
553; Heiskell v. Knox County, 132 Tenn. 180, 186; see
also McSween v. Live Stock Board, 97 Fla. 750, 774.
Even though there is but little if any transportation
on the river at the present time, Congress has not lost its
power to improve the stream. Economy Light & Power
Co. v. United States, 256 U. S. 113, 124.
In the face of its mandatory declaration of purpose, to
say that purposes other than the improvement of navigation are to be served by the construction of the dam
and reservoir will not suffice to defeat the Act as one
beyond the power of Congress. Congress might properly
give weight to the fact that by the same measures it would
secure additional desirable results without thereby infringing upon any rights of the complainant.
It is true that in the compact the States, which were
considering the river as a whole, said that it had ceased to
be navigable and that the use of its waters for purposes
of navigation should be subservient to other uses; but
the power of Congress to deal with it as a navigable stream
was clearly recognized so far as the river below the dam
is concerned. Congress has declared that its navigability

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for Wilbur.

is to be improved and its floods controlled by the construction of the dam. Other uses of the water may be
made to the extent which Congress has authorized in the
Act; but such uses are not inconsistent with the intent
of Congress to improve navigability, for Congress doubtless knew that while provision is made for appropriations
of water into the distant future, there will always be a
substantial flow of water in the lower reaches of the river
if only to satisfy the rights of appropriators in southern
Arizona, in the Imperial Valley of California, and, if any,
in Mexico. And Congress knew, of course, that the use
of the water for the generation of electrical energy would
not reduce the flow of the stream.
Regardless of the power of Congress under the commerce clause, the Act is constitutional. The United
States is the owner of nearly six hundred square miles of
irrigable public lands and Indian reservations along and
near the shores of the Colorado River in Arizona and in
California. As such owner, it is entitled to impound
water, to regulate its flow, and to consume a portion of it.
United States v. Rio Grande Co., 174 U. S.690, 703.
The State of California, whose jurisdiction extends to
the middle of the Colorado River, is entitled to receive
water from that stream. It is submitted that the Government may properly release to the State as much water
as the State is entitled to appropriate.
The flow of water is to be regulated and the water desilted, not only to improve navigation but in order to
save the Yuma, Palo Verde, and Imperial Valleys from
destruction.
Even where Congress has no power to enact regulatory
legislation as to a subject matter, it may make appropriations for the public welfare. It has done so ever since the
earliest years of the country's history.. Cf. Massachusetts
v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447. Even if the dam were to be
erected solely in order to save the Imperial Valley from

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

destruction, the Boulder Canyon Project Act would be
constitutional.
Mr. U. S. Webb, Attorney General of California, with
whom Messrs. W. B. Mathews and Charles L. Childers
were on the brief, for California.
Congress is presumed to have acted with full knowledge of the subject matter and in good faith. Its conclusion is not to be questioned. United States v. Des
Moines Nay. & R. Co., 142 U. S. 510, 544; Chesapeake &
Pot. Tel. Co. v. Manning, 186 U. S. 238, 245; Wisconsin
v. Duluth, 96 U. S. 379.
The means which Congress may adopt to a constitutional end is final.
Congress has absolute power to determine what is
or is not an obstruction of or an improvement to navigation.
The Colorado River is so notoriously navigable that the
Court will take judicial notice of that fact; but even
if it be not navigable at all, still the Act will not fail.
Congress has declared its intention to improve the navigability of this stream. The commerce clause of the
Constitution says nothing about the improvement of the
navigability of navigable streams. It refers to the regulation of commerce. Under this clause, Congress has
been sustained in the authorization of the construction
of a canal, Wisconsin v. Duluth, 96 U. S. 379; in the
building of a railroad, Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U. S. 24.
If this stream is not now navigable, Congress has authority to make it so. If private property is to be taken
or injured, ample authority is given in the Act itself
for the exercise of eminent domain.
The State has a right, in her quasi-sovereign capacity,
to sue or defend for the protection of her people, but
she must first show that her people or their property are
in immediate need of such protection. Until that i1

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for California.

shown, no case or controversy of which the Court will
take judicial cognizance is presented.
Arizona does not claim to own the running water, nor
could she do so. Only such water as is taken into possession and control is subject to ownership. Control of
these waters is an exercise of the police power, which is
another term for the power of government. Mutual
Loan Co. v. Martell, 222 U. S. 225. It is an exercise of
political power.
The right of the United States to exercise control over
the Colorado River for improvement of navigation or
otherwise is also the exercise of political power, United
States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 229 U. S. 53; Louis Oyster
Co. v. Briggs, 229 U. S.82, 88. It is thus a conflict between the political power of the State and the political
power of the Nation.
The Arizona Enabling Act and Constitution reserved
to the Nation a selection of lands along the river by the
Government for power purposes, which was made, and
includes the lands at Black Canyon. They also reserved
to the United States all rights and powers for carrying
out the Reclamation Act "to the same extent as if this
State had remained a territory."
Arizona tells the Court she has repealed this section
of her Constitution. Such attempted repeal, however, is
wholly ineffective. Stearns v. Minnesota, 179 U. S.223,
244.
The bill does not allege the non-existence of a flood
menace on the lower river and below Black Canyon.
The United States is the owner of nearly 600 square miles
of irrigable public lands adjacent to the lower river, and
below Black Canyon.
It has inherent power to protect its own property.
The United States is the owner of the Laguna Dam; it
has constructed the Yuma Reclamation Project at a cost
of many millions of dollars; it has constructed and is

maintaining extensive levee protective works along the
lower river. These works may all be destroyed by flood.
Storage and regulation of the flow of the river is the only
means of permanent protection of these properties from
floods. In the particular case the United States clearly:
has the right to construct flood control works under the
commerce clause.
The United States has the absolute power and control
of the public lands, as a proprietor and as a sovereign.
Mr. Thomas H. Gibson, with whom Messrs. John S.
Underwood, Attorney General of Colorado, E. K. Neumann, Attorney General of New Mexico, Gray Mashburn, Attorney General of Nevada, Clarence L. Irelandi
Delph E. Carpenter,L. Ward Bannister, and Francis C.
Wilson were on the brief, for Colorado, New Mexico, and
Nevada; and Messrs. George P. Parker,Attorney General
of Utah, and James A. Greenwood, Attorney General of
Wyoming, with whom Messrs. William W. Ray and William 0. Wilson were on the brief, for Utah and Wyoming.
The rights against the alleged invasion of which the
injunction is prayed, are purely political, upon the exist-'
ence of, and alleged injury to, which the complainant
attempts to raise a purely political issue. Of such an
issue this Court cannot take judicial cognizance.
Aside from these political rights, no private, civil, personal or property right of the State of Arizona or of anyone else is set forth or sought to be protected from injury.
No issuable fact, either in respect of the navigability
of the Colorado River or the reclamation of public lands,
is raised by the bill.
The allegations in respect of the navigability of the
stream and the reclamation of public lands were made
for the sole purpose, and with the specific intent, of laying a foundation for questioning the motives and purposes of Congress in enacting the Act. The actual facts,'

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for other States.

of which this Court can take judicial notice, are that the
stream is navigable in fact and in law. Jones v. United
States, 137 U. S. 202.
The Court is bound by the conclusive presumption
that any facts essential to the validity of the Act did,
in fact, exist at the time of its enactment and that if any
special finding of those facts was required to warrant
the passage of the Act, for the purposes of this case,
the fact that Congress enacted it and in so doing declared
its purpose to be the improvement of navigation, is the
equivalent of such a finding. United States v. Des
Moines, 142 U. S.544, 545; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.
v. Matthews, '174 U. S. 104; 6 R. C. L. 112, 113, 114.
The complaint is so fatally defective as to require dismissal with prejudice.
The Act is constitutional. The sections impressing
upon the management of the Boulder Canyon Project
and its water-users the interbasinal division of water'
made by the compact, and regulating the use of the public
lands of the two Basins, are valid as an exercise of the
power of Congress to regulate the use and to dispose
of the property of the United States. Constitution, Art.

Arizona is not a party to the Colorado River Compact
and is not in a position to question its constitutionality.
The compact is valid and constitutional. It is necessary to prevent litigation, strife and turmoil throughout
the entire Colorado River Basin and for protection of
the future development and general welfare of the six
approving States. It assures harmonious cob'peration
between federal and state governments.
The States have power to enter into compacts or agreements with other States or with the United States.

Consent of Congress having been obtained, the States
are, "in this respect restored to their original inherent

No form of compact is required. A compact may be
in form of a writing subscribed by the agreeing States,
or in form of concurrent legislation or by any other
method. The present compact, consisting of an approved
written document and concurring Acts of the Legislatures of the six approving States and of Congress, constitutes a valid compact even though the language used in
the several Acts may vary. Olin v. Kitzmiller, 259 U. S.

The bill presents a justiciable controversy within the
jurisdiction of this Court.
The right of Arizona to control the appropriation and
use of waters within its boundaries, including the erection
therein of storage and diversion works, and to preserve
such water and the use thereof for its people, are rights
which the State may protect by suit in this Court. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237; Kansas

New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 301-302; Colorado v. Toll, 268 U S. 228, 230-231.
The standing of Arizona to assert such rights of quasisovereignty in this Court is in no way diminished by
the fact that the Colorado River flows within or upon
the borders of other States as well as Arizona. Kansas v.
Colorado, 206 U. S. 46; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S.
419; Bean v. Morris, 221 U. S. 485.
These rights are not political rights, beyond the cognizance of this Court. Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50;
Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447.
Defendant Wilbur threatens to invade the quasi-sovereign rights of Arizona by building a dam within its
jurisdiction and diverting and using water from its jurisdiction in violation of its laws. Obvious and fundamental
considerations of preserving and wisely administering
the greatest resource of an arid State led to the enactment of these laws. They secure interests of the State
in persons and property as vital as any that it has.
If the bill stated no more than that acts of this defendant, done and threatened to be done in Arizona, under a
statute which was an unconstitutional interference with

OCTOBER TERM. 1930.

283 U.S.

rights reserved to the State, invaded the sovereign rights
of the State in the waters within its jurisdiction in contravention of its will manifested in statutes, it would be
a reasonable and proper means of asserting the quasisovereign rights of the State. Missouri v. Holland, 252
U. S. 416; Colorado v. Toll, 268 U. S. 228; Marshall
Dental Mfg. Co. v. Iowa, 226 U. S. 460.
Defendant Wilbur also threatens to prevent any use
in Arizona of unappropriated Colorado River water now
flowing there, and, at the same time, to deliver such
water for use in other States under contracts, adverse to
Arizona, for permanent service.
The Act, in § 5, provides that: "No person shall have
or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the
water stored as aforesaid except by contract made as
herein stated." The contracts are to be made by the
Secretary of the Interior, are to impose, except upon
users in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys in California,
such charges as he may determine, and are to provide
that all use of water so permitted is subject to the Colorado River compact. Section 8 (a) of the Act and the
defendant's water regulations explicitly so require.
Under the compact the only water of which the right
to exclusive beneficial use in perpetuity may be acquired
in the Lower Basin is the water apportioned to that
basin. Such apportionment is limited to 7,500,000 acrefeet of water per annum by Article III (a). The Colorado brief contends that paragraph (b) of Article III
operates to increase this apportionment to 8,500,000 for
the Lower Basin. This, we submit, is not the case. For
the purposes of the case it makes little difference whether
the apportionment to the Lower Basin is 7,500,000 or
8,500,000 acre-feet per annum. The existing appropriations of 6,500,000 acre-feet and the threatened delivery
of 1,050,000 acre-feet to Los Angeles will exhaust the

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for Arizona.

former, and out of the latter leave only 950,000 acre-feet
for the three Lower Basin States. There are immediate
needs in Arizona alone of 4,500,000 acre-feet. The bill
alleges the existence of actual projects to irrigate 1,000,000 acres of land in Arizona not now irrigated but susceptible of irrigation from the Colorado River. This will
require the appropriation of 4,500,000 acre-feet of water
annually. Permits to appropriate this water have been
granted by the State.
In Arizona, because of the expense of constructing and
operating diversion dams, canals and other works necessary for irrigation, irrigable tracts must be combined into
large projects operated and administered as a unit and
requiring financing on a large scale. This financing is
impossible unless water can be appropriated and the right
to its beneficial use in perpetuity acquired. Without
this right there is no security whatever for the financing.
The very purpose and effect of the Act and the defendant's water regulations and contract is to prevent the
citizens of Arizona from appropriating-i. e., acquiring
the right in perpetuity to exclusive beneficial use of-any
part of the unappropriated flow of the stream, and to
force them to accept from the defendant Wilbur a mere
license subject to the terms of the compact. To say, as
do the defendant States, that Arizona is not bound by the
compact is a mere sophistry. For it appears that these
States wrote the provisions of the Act here shown to be
so harmful to Arizona for the very purpose of subjecting
her to the compact. H. Rep. 1657, 69th Cong. 2d Sess.,
p. 10.
It is plain from the Act itself that its purpose and effect is "to enthrone the compact," and force Arizona and
its people, as a condition to any use of the unappropriated flow of the stream, to forego the right to its continued use in perpetuity granted by the laws of Arizona,

and surrender its use to subsequent appropriators in the
Upper Basin, in Mexico, or upon a further apportionment
made in the future.
It is not necessary that the bill should deny title in
the United States to any land necessary for appropriation of unappropriated water in Arizona.
The motions to dismiss admit Arizona's allegation that
the Colorado River is not navigable. This is an allegation of fact. Facts not appcaring 6n the face of the bill
cannot be considered in determining a demurrer or motion to dismiss. Payne v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., 255 U. S.
228, 232; Stewart v. Masterson, 131 U. S. 151, 158.
The Court cannot properly take judicial notice that the
Colorado River is navigable. The Montello, 11 Wall. 411,
s. c., 20 Wall. 430; United States v. Rio Grande Dam Co.,
174 U. S. 690; Economy Light & Power Co. v. United
States, 256 U. S. 113.
These cases establish the proposition that courts do
not take judicial notice of the navigability of a stream,
unless its navigability is a matter of common knowledge
and free from doubt. See also Donnelly v. United States,
228 U. S. 243; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 561. Similar questions were involved in St. Anthony Water Co. v.

By this Act Congress has attempted to exercise control of the Colorado River and its tributaries, not for the
improvement of navigation, but for other purposes, the
accomplishment of which would, if the river were navigable, destroy its navigability.
By approving and attempting to enforce the compact,
Congress has recognized and undertaken to protect
"present perfected rights" of water users in the Upper
and Lower Basins to divert and consume annually
9,000,000 acre-feet of water, which is one-half of the
total average annual flow of the Colorado River System.
Of this 9,000,000 acre-feet of appropriated .water the
Upper Basin has appropriated and is using 2,500,000 acrefeet and the Lower Basin 6,500,000 acre-feet annually.
By the diversion of this water and the creation of these
"present perfected rights," the Colorado River, if it ever
was navigable (which Arizona denies), has lost what little navigability it once possessed. Even in the '60s and
'70s of the last century, before any appreciable quantity
of water had been diverted from the river, the one great
and (even then) insuperable obstacle to its navigation
was lack of water. As diversions increased and present
rights became perfected, even the slight (so-called) navigation which once existed on the river disappeared. That
its disappearance was caused, in part at least, by the diversion and consumption of this 9,000,000 acre-feet of
water cannot be doubted. Does the Act provide that
the water thus lost to navigation shall be restored? On
the contrary, by approving the compact, it provides, in
effect, that the loss shall be made perpetual.

444

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Argument for Arizona.

283 U.S.

As to water not yet appropriated, the compact and the

Act clearly contemplate that eventually all the water of
the Colorado River System will be diverted and used
consumptively, and not for navigation. It is no answer
to say that the water will be used for navigation first, and
afterwards taken out and used consumptively. At least
one-half of it is to be used in the Upper Basin, hundreds
of miles above the site of the proposed dam and reservoir.
By the compact, which the Act approves, the-Upper
Basin is given the lion's share (five-sixths) of the apportioned water now remaining unappropriated. Whatever
excuse or justification there may have been for thus favoring the Upper Basin, it cannot be pretended that improvement of navigation was thereby aimed at or accomplished.
Instead of being designed to improve navigation, the
compact was drawn with the unmistakable intention of
dedicating the river to uses inconsistent with navigation.
That is not a mere speculation, but appears from the express language of the compact. The reason for this was
stated by the then Secretary of Commerce, Honorable
Herbert Hoover, federal representative on and chairman
of the Colorado River Commission, in his report transmitting the compact to Congress. H. Doc. 605, 67th
Cong., 4th Sess., p. 4.
By the terms of the Act itself, the recital therein that
one of its purposes is the improvement of navigation
must yield to and be controlled by the declaration in
the compact that "the Colorado River has ceased to be
navigable for commerce," and that "the use of its waters
for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the
uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural, and power
purposes."
Even if navigability were conceded, it would still be
true that the Act, by accepting and approving this decla-

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Argument for Arizona.

ration in the compact, shows on its face that improvement of navigation is not its purpose. Also, though
navigability were conceded, it would still be true that
the effect of the Act is not to improve, but to destroy
such navigability.
By §§ 1, 6, and 8 (a) of the Act, the construction, maintenance, operation and use of the project are made subject to the terms and provisions of the compact. Since,
in the case of conflict, the provisions of the Act must
yield to those of the compact, any use of the project
which may be inconsistent with the compact (though
apparently authorized by the, Act) is prohibited.
The Act specifies, definitely and concretely, only two
uses to which the project shall be put. One is the storage
and sale of water. The other is the generation and sale
of electrical power. Both uses would be hurtful rather
than helpful to navigation, if there were any navigation
to be hurt or helped.
It requires no argument to show that the navigation
of a river, which has become non-navigable from lack of
water, cannot be improved by taking more water out of
it. Yet that is what this Act proposes to do. All contracts for the sale and delivery of water are required to be
made subject to the Colorado River Compact, which subordinates navigation to other uses of the river. The Act
places no limit on the quantity of water which the Secretary may divert and sell, nor does it restrict him as to
the place of diversion or as to the place of consumption.
Under color of the Act, defendant Wilbur has actually
made a pretended contract whereby he undertakes to deliver to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, 1,050,000 acre-feet annually of the water to be
stored in the proposed reservoir. This great quantity of
water-more than one-eighth of the total unappropriated
flow at Black Canyon-is to be delivered at a point im-

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

283 U.S.

mediately below the dam or, at the option of the District,
it may be diverted directly from the reservoir. The District where this water is to be consumed is some 300 miles
from the Colorado River and outside of its watershed.
Even if the Colorado River were navigable, it could not
be pretended that navigation thereof would be improved
by the main canal and appurtenant structures connecting
Laguna Dam with the Imperial Valley. The whole purpose of -the canal is to take water out of the river, and to
take it out in greater quantities and at a point higher
up the river than now.
Even in the old days, when its normal flow (now reduced by one-half) had not been depleted, it was only
in seasons of high water that the Colorado River ever approached a condition of navigability-a condition which,
even then, it never quite attained. By storing the water
and using it for the generation of electric power, as proposed in the Act, the flow of the river will be "equated; "
there will be no more seasons of high water, and all possibility of navigation will be automatically ended.
As introduced, the bill did not contain the word "navigation." The words "improving navigation " and "improvement of navigation" were inserted as amendments,
upon recommendation of the House Committee'on Irrigation and Reclamation, after hearings, in the course of
which the constitutionality of the bill had been questioned. H. Rep. 918, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. No
other reference was inserted or proposed. Minority Report, 1.cit., p. 14.
By this Act, even assuming the river to be navigable,
Congress has exceeded its powers and has invaded rights
reserved to the State over navigable water. Martin v.

If and wherever navigable, the Colorado River belongs
to and is owned by the State in which it is situated. The
State in its sovereign capacity owns the water in the
river, the bed of the river, and its banks to high water
mark. This is a full proprietary ownership. It is subject
to the power of Congress to regulate commerce by improving navigation. It is not subject to any other restriction
or limitation. The State, being the owner, has the exclusive and unrestricted right to use and dispose of the
water in the river and the land under it, to authorize
the use thereof by others, and to regulate and control
such use in whatever manner and to whatever extent it
sees fit, subject only to the power of Congress in respect
to navigation.
Even assuming the Colorado River to be navigable, the
United States does not own it, and has no right to use it
or control it for any purpose, except that of regulating
commerce by improving navigation. Not being the owner,
the United States cannot, for any purpose or upon any
pretext, sell or dispose of the water in the river or the
land under it.
The fact that other States have rights in the Colorado
River adds nothing to the powers of Congress. Where
the river forms the boundary between Arizona and another
State, each owns to the middle of the stream. If they
disagree about the division or use of boundary waters,
their dispute, like any other interstate boundary dispute,
can be settled by a decree of this Court. Congress is
powerless to settle it or to make any division or appor-

46, 98; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S.419, 465.
The result, therefore, of assuming the Colorado River
to be navigable is to establish even more firmly Arizona's
right to appropriate and use its waters and to regulate and
control their appropriation and use by others.
The Act cannot be sustained as a regulation respecting
property of the United States under Article IV, § 3, c. 2,
of the Constitution. It is not pretended, and cannot be,
that this Act provides for the reclamation of any public
land.
The Act goes far beyond the power of Congress over the
public land.
The Act is not an exercise of any other power delegated
to Congress.

undertaking."
The Colorado River Compact is an agreement for the
apportionment of the water of the river and its tributaries.
After several years of preliminary informal discussion,
Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada,
and California-the seven States through which the river
system extends-appointed commissioners in 1921 to formulate an agreement; and Congress, upon request, gave
its assent, and authorized the appointment of a representative to act for the United States. Act of August 19, 1921,
c. 72, 42 Stat. 171. On November 24, 1922, these commissioners and the federal representative signed an agreement
to become effective when ratified by Congress and the
legislatures of all of these States. The Boulder Canyon
Project Act approved this agreement subject to certain
limitations and conditions, the approval to become effective upon the ratification of the compact, as so modified,
by the legislatures of California and at least five of the
six other States. The legislatures of all these States
except Arizona ratified the modified compact and the Act
was accordingly declared to be in effect. Proclamation

On October 13, 1930, Arizona filed this original bill of

Interior, and the States of California, Nevada, Utah, New
Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. It charges that Wilbur
is proceeding in violation of the laws of Arizona to invade
its quasi-sovereign rights by building at Black Canyon on
the Colorado River a dam, half of which is to be in Arizona, and a reservoir to store all the water of the river
flowing above it in Arizona, for the purpose of diverting
part of these waters from Arizona for consumptive use

elsewhere, and of preventing the beneficial consumptive
use in Arizona of the unappropriated water of the river
now flowing in that State; that these things are being done
under color of authority of the Boulder Canyon Project
Act; that this Act purports to authorize the construction
of the dam and reservoir, the diversion of the water from
Arizona, and its perpetual use elsewhere; that the Act
directs and requires Wilbur to permit no use or future
appropriation of the unappropriated water of the main
stream of the Colorado River, now flowing in Arizona and
to be stored by the said dam and reservoir, except subject
to the conditions and reservations contained in the Colorado River Compact; and that the Act thus attempts to
enforce as against Arizona, and to its irreparable injury,
the compact which it has refused to ratify. The bill
prays that the compact and the Act "and each and every
part thereof, be decreed to be unconstitutional, void and
of no effect; that the defendants and each of them be
permanently enjoined and restrained from enforcing or
carrying out said compact or said act, or any of the provisions thereof, and from carrying out the three pretended

the stored water and developed power after the project
shall have been completed] and from doing any other
act or thing pursuant to or under color of said Boulder
Canyon Project Act."
Process was made returnable on January 12, 1931; and
on that day all of the defendants moved that the bill be
dismissed. The grounds assigned in the motions are (1)
that the bill does not join the United States, an indispensable party; (2) that the bill does not present any case
or controversy of which the Court can take judicial cognizance; (3) that the proposed action of the defendants
will not invade any vested right of the plaintiff or of any

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Opinion of the Court.

of its citizens; (4) that the bill does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against any of the
defendants. The case was heard on these motions.
The wrongs against which redress is sought are, first, the
threatened invasion of the quasi-sovereignty of Arizona by
Wilbur in building the dam and reservoir without first securing the approval of the State Engineer as prescribed by
its laws; and, second, the threatened invasion of Arizona's
quasi-sovereign right to prohibit or to permit appropriation, under its own laws, of the unappropriated water of
the Colorado River flowing within the State. The latter
invasion, it is alleged, will consist in the exercise, under
the Act and the compact, of a claimed superior right to
store, divert, and use such water.
First. The claim that quasi-sovereign rights of Arizona
will be invaded by the mere construction of the dam and
reservoir rests upon the fact that both structures will be
located partly within the State. At Black Canyon, the
site of the dam, the middle channel of the river is the
boundary between Nevada and Arizona. The latter's
statutes prohibit the construction of any dam whatsoever
until written approval of plans and specifications shall
have been obtained from the State Engineer; and the
statutes declare in terms that this provision applies to
dams to be erected by the United States. Arizona Laws
1929, c. 102, §§ 1-4. See also Revised Code of 1928,
§§ 3280-3286. The United States has not secured such
approval; nor has any application been made by Wilbur,
who is proceeding to construct said dam in complete disregard of this law of Arizona.
The United States may perform its functions without
conforming to the police regulations of a State. Johnson
v. Maryland, 254 U. S. 51; Hunt v. United States, 278
U. S. 96. If Congress has power to authorize the construction of the dam and reservoir, Wilbur is under no obligation to submit the plans and specifications to the State

the power to create this obstruction in the river for the
purpose of improving navigation if the Colorado River
is navigable. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont

river is not navigable, and that it was not the purpose of
Congress to improve navigation.
The bill alleges that "the river has never been, and is
not now, a navigable river." The argument is that the
question whether a stream is navigable is one of fact; and
that hence the motion to dismiss admits the allegation
that the river is not navigable. It is true that whether a
stream is navigable in law depends upon whether it is
navigable in fact; United States v. Utah, ante, p. 64; 2
and that a motion to dismiss, like a demurrer, admits
every well-pleaded allegation of fact, Payne v. Central
Pacific Ry. Co., 255 U. S. 228, 232. But a court may take
judicial notice that a river within its jurisdiction is navigable. United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation

power plants, when completed, may not be subject to the taxing
power of Arizona, may be disregarded. The Act provides that the
title to such works shall remain forever in the United States, and
such exemption is but an ordinary incident of any public undertaking
by the Federal Government.

We know judicially, from the evidence of history, that a

navigation have been the accumulations of silt coming from

constructed. The dam will so regulate the flow as to make the
river very practicable of navigation for 200 miles below and impound water above which could easily be navigated for more than
75 miles." H. R. Rep. 918, supra, p. 22. Compare Hearings Before

tion" "is a mere subterfuge and false pretense." It
quotes a passage in Art. IV of the compact, to which the
Act is subject, which declares that "inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for commerce and
the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously
limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters
for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses
of such waters for domestic, agricultural, and power purposes;" and alleges that "even if said river were navigable, the diversion, sale and delivery of water therefrom
as authorized in said act, would not improve, but would
destroy, its navigable capacity." 6
Into the motives which induced members of Congress
to enact the Boulder Canyon Project Act, this Court may
not enquire. McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27, 5359; Weber v. Freed,239 U. S. 325, 329-30; Wilson v. New,

255 U. S. 180, 210." The Act declares that the authority to
construct the dam and reservoir is conferred, among other
things, for ihe purpose of "improving navigation and regulating the flow of the river." As the river is navigable
and the means which the Act provides are not unrelated
'Reliance is also had upon the fact that the bill as originally intro-

to the control of navigation, United States v. River Rouge
Improvement Co., 269 U. S. 411, 419, the erection and
maintenance of such dam and reservoir are clearly within
the powers conferred upon Congress. Whether the particular structures proposed are reasonably necessary, is
not for this Court to determine. Compare Fong Yue
Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 712-14; Oceanic
Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 340;

U. S. 53, 65, 72-73; Everard'sBreweries v. Day, 265 U. S.
545, 559. And the fact that purposes other than navigation will also be served could not invalidate the exercise of the authority conferred, even if those other purposes would not alone have justified an exercise of Congressional power. Compare Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8
Wall. 533, 548; Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay
& Mississippi Canal Co., 142 U. S. 254, 275; In re Kollock,
165 U. S. 526, 536; Weber v. Freed, supra; United States
v. Doremus, supra.
It is urged that the Court is not bound by the recital
of purposes in the Act; that we should determine the purpose from its probable effect; and that the effect of the
project will be to take out of the river, now non-navigable
through lack of water, the last half of its remaining average flow. But the Act specifies that the dam shall be
used: "First, for river regulation, improvement of navigation and flood control; second, for irrigation and
domestic uses and satisfaction of present perfected
rights . . .; and third, for power." It is true that
the authority conferred is stated to be "subject to the
Colorado River Compact," and that instrument makes
the improvement of navigation subservient to all other
purposes. But the specific statement of primary purpose
in the Act governs the general references to the compact.
This Court may not assume that Congress had no purpose

423

Opinion of the Court.

to aid navigation, and that its real intention was that the
stored water shall be so used as to defeat the declared
primary purpose. Moreover, unless and until the stored
water, which will consist largely of flood waters now
wasted, is consumed in new irrigation projects or in domestic use, substantially all of it will be available for the
improvement of navigation. The possible abuse of the
power to regulate navigation is not an argument against
its existence. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 363; Flint v.
Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 168-69; Wilson v. New,

supra; Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith,
255 U. S. 44, 48.
Since the grant of authority to build the dam and
reservoir is valid as an exercise of the Constitutional
power to improve navigation, we have no occasion to
decide whether the authority to construct the dam and
reservoir might not also have been constitutionally conferred for the specified purpose of irrigating public lands
of the United States.' Compare United States v. Rio

upon such reclamation. It is alleged that there are within
Arizona 2,000,000 acres not now irrigated which are susceptible of irrigation by further appropriations from the
Colorado River.1' To appropriate water means to take
and divert a specified quantity thereof and put it to beneficial use in accordance with the laws of the State where
such water is found, and, by so doing, to acquire under
such laws, a vested right to take and divert from the same
source, and to use and consume the same quantity of water
annually forever, subject only to the right of prior appropriations. Under the law of Arizona, the perfected vested
right to appropriate water flowing within the State cannot
be acquired without the performance of physical acts
through which the water is and will in fact be diverted
to beneficial use. Topographical conditions make it necessary that land in the State be irrigated in large projects.
The Colorado River flows, both on the boundary between
Arizona and Nevada, and in Arizona alone, through an
almost continuous series of deep canyons, the walls of
which rise in Arizona to a height varying from a few
hundred to more than 5,000 feet. The cost of installing
the dams, reservoirs, canals, and distributiQn works required to effect any diversion, will be very heavy;
and financing on a large scale is indispensable. Such
financing will be impossible unless it clearly appears
that, at or prior to the time of constructing such works,
vested rights to the permanent use of the water will be
acquired.
11 Of the total length of 1,293 miles of the Colorado River, 688
miles are within or on the boundaries of Arizona. After leaving
Utah, the main river flows for 292 miles wholly in Arizona. Then,
the middle of the channel forms the boundary between Arizona and
Nevada for 145 miles; and for 235 ntles, the boundary between
Arizona and California. Tributaries of the river flow within Arizona
for a combined length of 836 miles, and nost of these enter the main
stream below Black Canyon.

460

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The alleged interference with the right of the State to
control additional appropriations is based upon the following facts. The average annual flow of the Colorado
River system, including the tributaries, is 18,000,000 acrefeet.12 Only 9,000,000 acre-feet have been appropriated
by Arizona and the defendant States. Of this 3,500,000
acre-feet have been appropriated in Arizona under its
laws, and the remaining 5,500,000 acre-feet by the other
States. The 9,000,000 acre-feet unappropriated are now
subject to appropriation in Arizona under its laws. It is
alleged that there are numerous sites suitable for the construction, maintenance, and operation of dams and reservoirs required for the irrigation of land in Arizona; and
that actual projects have been planned for the irrigation
of 1,000,000 acres, including 100,000 acres owned by the
State. For this purpose 4,500,000 acre-feet annually will
be additionally required. Permits to appropriate this
water have been granted by the State; and definite plans
to carry out projects for the building of dams on that part
of the river flowing in or on the borders of Arizona have
been approved by the State Engineer. It is stated that
but for the passage of the Boulder Canyon Project Act,
construction work would long since have commenced.
It is conceded that the continued use of the 3,500,000
acre-feet of water already appropriated in Arizona is not
now threatened. And there is no allegation that at the
present time the enjoyment of these rights is being interfered with in any way. The claim strenuously urged is
that the existence of the Act, and the threatened exercise
of the authority to use the stored water pursuant to its
terms, will prevent Arizona from exercising its right to
control the making of further appropriations. It is argued
"'An acre-foot is the quantity of water required to cover an acre
to a depth of one foot-43,560 cubic feet. See Wyoming v. Colorado,
259 U. S. 419, 458.

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
423

Opinion of the Court.

that such needed additional appropriations will be prevented because Wilbur proposes to store the entire unappropriated flow of the main stream of the Colorado
River at the dam; that Arizona, and those claiming under
it, will not be permitted to take any water from the reservoir except upon agreeing that the use shall be subject to
the compact; that under the terms of the compact they
will not be entitled to appropriate any water in excess of
that to which there are now perfected rights in Arizona; 1"
and that in order to irrigate land in Arizona it is frequently necessary to utilize rights of way over lands of
the United States, and since the Act provides that all such
18 The allegation is in substance this. Of the average annual flow
of 18,000,000 acre-feet, the Act and compact permit the present
final appropriation of only 15,000,000. This quantity must satisfy
all existing appropriations as well as all future appropriations. Of
these 15,000,000, one-half is apportioned to the so-called Upper
Basin, which includes Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.
The remaining 7,500,000 acre-feet have been allotted to the so-called
Lower Basin, which includes Arizona and parts of Nevada and
California. Of the water thus allotted to the lower basin, 6,500,000
acre-feet have already been appropriated; and, under a contract
made by Wilbur with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California, the remaining 1,000,000 are to be diverted to it. Thus
it is argued that consistently with the Act and compact, it will
be impossible for Arizona to make any further appropriation, unless
it be under the following provision. The comlact provides that no
part of the 3,000,000 acre-feet of the estimated annual flow, not
now -apportioned, shall be appropriated until after October 1, 1963,
as such water may be required to satisfy rights of Mexico, through
which country the river flows after leaving the United States. If
the satisfaction of recognized Mexican rights reduces the unappropriated water below 1,000,000 acre-feet annually, the lower basin
States may require the upper basin States to deliver from their
apportionment, one-half of the amount required to meet the deficit.
It is claimed that Arizona thus may use, but not legally appropriate,
any unappropriated water which is available for use by it; and that
this restricted right does not justify the expenditures necessary for
putting the water to beneficial use in Arizona.

rights of way or other privileges to be granted by the
United States shall be upon the express condition and with
the express covenant that they shall be subject to the
compact, the Act in effect prevents Arizona and those
claiming under it from acquiring such rights.
This contention cannot prevail because it is based not
on any actual or threatened impairment of Arizona's
rights but upon assumed potential invasions. The Act
does not purport to affect any legal right of the State, or
to limit in any way the exercise of its legal right to appropriate any of the unappropriated 9,000,000 acre-feet
which may flow within or on its borders. On the contrary, section 18 specifically declares that nothing therein
"shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the
States now have either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they
may deem necessary with respect to the appropriation,
control, and use of water within their borders, except as
modified" by interstate agreement. As Arizona has
made no such agreement, the Act leaves its legal rights unimpaired. There is no allegation of definite physical acts
by which Wilbur is interfering, or will interfere, with the
exercise by Arizona of its right to make further appropriations by means of diversions above the dam or with
the enjoyment of water so appropriated. 1' Nor any
14 There is in the bill a further allegation that, under color of the
Act, Wilbur has seized and taken possession of all that part of the
Colorado River which flows in Arizona and on the boundary thereof,
and of the water now flowing therein, and of all the dam sites and
reservoir sites suitable for irrigation of the Arizona land and for the

specific allegation of physical acts impeding the exercise
of its right to make future appropriations by means of
diversions below the dam, or limiting the enjoyment of
rights so acquired, unless it be by preventing an adequate
quantity of water from flowing in the river at any necessary point of diversion.
When the bill was filed, the construction of the dam and
reservoir had not been commenced. Years must elapse
before the project is completed. If by operations at the
dam any then perfected right of Arizona, or of those
claiming under it, should hereafter be interfered with,
appropriate remedies will be available. Compare Kansas
v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 117. The bill alleges, that plans
have been drawn and permits granted for the taking of
additional water in Arizona pursuant to its laws. But
Wilbur threatens no physical interference with these
projects; and the Act interposes no legal inhibitions on
their execution."' There is no occasion for determining
the bill and from the argument, it is clear that there has been no
physical taking of possession of anything, and that Wilbur has not
trespassed on lands belonging either to Arizona or any of its citizens.
This allegation is thus merely a conclusion of law from the fact that
Wilbur, in conformity with the provisions of the Act, has made plans
for the construction of the dam and reservoir, promulgated regulations concerning the use of the water to be stored, and executed con-

tracts for the use of some of it.
I' It is also argued that of the 7,500,000 acre-feet allotted by the
compact to the upper basin States, only 2,500,000 have already been

appropriated, and that thus the presently unused surplus of 5,000,000
acre-feet cannot be appropriated in Arizona. But Arizona is not
bound by the compact as it has withheld ratification. If and when
withdrawals pursuant to the compact by the upper basin States
diminish the amount of water actually available for use in Arizona,
appropriate action may then be brought.
The allegation that the inclusion in the compact of the waters of
the Gila River (all of which are said to have been appropriated in
Arizona) operates to reduce the amount of water which may be
taken by that State, can likewise be disregarded. Not being bound

now Arizona's rights to interstate or local waters which
have not yet been, and which may never be, appropriated.
New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328, 338. This Court
cannot issue declaratory decrees. Compare Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 258 U. S. 158, 162;
Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, 273 U. S. 70, 74;
Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Assn., 277 U. S. 274, 28990. Arizona has, of course, no constitutional right to use,
in aid of appropriation, any land of the United States, and
it cannot complain of the provision conditioning the use of
such public land. Compare Utah Power & Light Co. v.
United States, 243 U. S. 389, 403-05.
As we hold that the grant of authority to construct the
dam and reservoir is a valid exercise of Congressional
power, that the Boulder Canyon Project Act does not
purport to abridge the right of Arizona to make, or permit,
additional appropriations of water flowing within the
State or on its boundaries, and that there is now no threat
by Wilbur, or any of the defendant States, to do any act
which will interfere with the enjoyment of any present or
future appropriation, we have no occasion to consider
other questions which have been argued. The bill is dismissed without prejudice to an application for relief in
case the stored water is used in such a way as to interfere
with the enjoyment by Arizona, or those claiming under
it, of any rights already perfected or with the right of
Arizona to make additional legal appropriations and to
enjoy the same.
Bill dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS is of

the opinion that the

motions to dismiss should be overruled and the defendants
required to answer.
by the compact, Arizona has not assented to this inclusion of the
Gila appropriations in the allotment to the lower basin; and there is
no allegation that Wilbur or any of the defendant States are interfering with perfected rights to the waters of that river, which enters
the Colorado 286 miles below Black Canyon.
