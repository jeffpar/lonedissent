EXECUTORS, v. COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE.

ET AL.,

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 455. Argued April 23, 1931.-Decided May 25, 1931.
1. Stockholders who have received the assets of a dissolved corporation may be compelled to discharge therefrom the unpaid federal
taxes on the income and excess profits of the corporation. P. 592.
2. Under the Revenue Act of 1926, § 280 (a) (1), and Act of May
29, 1928, this liability of the transferee, "at law or in equity,"
may be enforced summarily in the same manner as that of any
delinquent taxpayer, as well as by proceedings to enforce the tax
lien or by actions at law or in equity. Id.
3. The rule that the United States may collect its internal revenuc
by summary administrative proceedings if adequate opportunity
be afforded for a later determination of legal rights, applies to
taxes assessed against transferees of corporate property. P. 593.
4. The procedure provided in § 280 (a) (1) satisfies the requirements
of due process because two alternative methods of eventual judicial
review are available to the transferee; (a) he may contest his
liability by bringing an action, either against the United States or
the Collector, to recover the amount paid; or (b) he may avail
himself of the provisions for immediate redetermination of the
liability by the Board of Tax Appeals, and if dissatisfied, may have
a further review by the Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly by
this Court on certiorari. P. 597.

5. The review by the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court
of Appeals is not to be deemed constitutionally inadequate because
the tax may be collected while the case is before that court unless
a bond is filed, or because the Board's findings of fact are to be
treated by that court as final if there is any evidence to support
them. P. 599.
6. The right of the taxpayer to stay payment pending immediate
judicial review, by filing a bond, is a privilege granted by the
sovereign as an act of grace. Id.
7. Save as there may be an exception for issues presenting claims of
constitutional right, such administrative findings on issues of fact
are accepted by the court as conclusive if the evidence was legally
sufficient to sustain them and there wag no irregularity in the proceedings. P. 600.
8. The method of assessment and collection permitted by § 280 (a)
(1) was intended to apply, and is constitutionally applicable, where
the transfer of assets occurred before the enactment of the Revenue
Act, of 1926. P. 601.
9. Assuming that the liability "at law and in equity" of the transferees of corporate assets to meet federal taxes incurred by their
corporation may vary according to the laws of the States of incorpoTation, this does not make the tax provision invalid either as an
unconstitutional delegation of federal taxing power to the States
or as a departure from the requirement of geographical uniformity. P. 602.
10. The time within which the summary proceeding to enforce liability for the tax of a corporation may be taken against a stockholder transferee of its assets is determined by the federal Act and
not by the state statute of limitations on suits against stockholders.
P. 602.
11. One who receives corporate assets upon dissolution of the corporation is severally liable, to the extent of the assets received, for the
payment of income and excess-profits taxes of the corporation.
P. 603.
12. In a summary proceeding under § 280, Revenue Act of 1926, to
,collect such taxes from one such transferee, the Government is not
obliged to join other transferees and marshal the assets of the
corporation so as to adjust the rights of the various stockholders.

Benjamin Wiener, and Donald Bourne were on the brief,

Solicitor General Thacher, Mr. Sewall Key and Miss
Helen R. Carloss, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, and Messrs. Whitney North Seymour, Clarence M.

for respondent.
Mr. Oscar R. Ewing, and Messrs. James C. Denton and
Richard H. Wills, by special leave of Court, filed briefs
as amici curiae.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In 1919, the Coombe Garment Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, distributed all of its assets among its
stockholders, and then dissolved. Thereafter, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made deficiency assessments against it for income and profits taxes for the years
1918 and 1919. A small part of these assessments was
collected leaving an unpaid balance of $9,306.36. I. L.
Phillips of New York City, had owned one-fourth of the
company's stock and had received $17,139.61 ds his distributive dividend. Pursuant to § 280 (a) (1) of the
Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 61, the Commissioner sent due notice that he proposed to assess against,
and collect from, Phillips the entire remaining amount of
the deficiencies. No notice of such deficiencies was sent

to any of the other transferees, and no suit or proceedings
for collection was instituted against them. Upon petition
by Phillips' executors for a redetermination, the Board of
Tax Appeals held that the estate was liable for the full
amount. 15 B. T. A. 1218. Its order was affirmed by
the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. 42 F. (2d) 177. Because of conflict in the decisions of the lower courts 1 a writ of certiorari was granted.
282 U. S. 828.
Stockholders who have received the assets of a dissolved
corporation may confessedly be compelled, in an appropriate proceeding, to discharge unpaid corporate taxes.
Compare Pierce v. United States, 255 U. S. 398. Before
the enactment of § 280 (a) (1), such payment by the
stockholders could be enforced only by bill in equity or
action at law.' Section 280 (a) (1) provides that the
liability of the transferee for such taxes may be enforced
in the same manner as that of any delinquent taxpayer.'
The procedure prescribed for collection of the tax from
a stockholder is thus the same as that now followed when
payment is sought directly from the corporate taxpayer.
This procedure is now generally known, and some parts
of it will later be considered in detail. As applied directly
to the taxpayer, its constitutionality is not now assailed.
Compare Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U. S.
716. But it is contended that to apply it to stockholder
transferees violates several constitutional guaranties; that

additional obstacles are encountered if it is applied to
transfers made before the enactment of § 280 (a). (1);
that the specific liability here sought to be enforced is
governed by the law of Pennsylvania and barred by its
statute of limitations; and that, in no event, can the
stockholder be held liable for more than his pro rata share
of the unpaid corporate tax.
First. The contention mainly urged is that the summary
procedure permitted by the section violates the Constitution because it does not provide for a judicial deterinination of the transferee's liability at the outset. The arguKlausner, 25 F. (2d) 608; United States v. Armstrong, 26 F. (2d)

ment is that such liability (except where a lien had attached before the transfer) is dependent upon questions
of law and fact which have heretofore been adjudicated by
courts; that to confer upon the Commissioner power
to determine these questions in the first instance, offends
against the principle of the separation of the powers; and
that the inherent denial of due process is not saved by
the provisions for deferred review in a suit to recover taxes
paid, or, in the alternative, for an immediate appeal to
the Board of Tax Appeals with the right to review its
determination in the courts, because there are limitations
and conditions in either method of judicial review.
Section 280(a)(1) provides the United States with a
new remedy for enforcing the existing "liability at law
or in equity." The quoted words are employed in the
statute to describe the kind of liability to which the new
remedy is to be applied and to define the extent of such
liability. The obligation to be enforced is the liability
for the tax. Russell v. United States, 278 U. S. 181, 186;
United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489, 493-4. The proceeding is one to collect the revenue. That Congress
deemed the section necessary in order to make the taxcollecting system more effective, is established not only by
the fact of enactment but also by the reports of the
committees.'

would be treated." Compare H. Rep. No. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess.,

proved a very effective and necessary method of stopping tax evasion

Opinion of the Court.

The right of the United States to collect its internal
revenue by summary administrative proceedings has long
been settled.' Where, as here, adequate opportunity is
afforded for a later judicial determination of the legal
rights, summary proceedings to secure prompt performance of pecuniary obligations to the government have
been consistently sustained. Compare Cheatham v.
United States, 92 U. S. 85, 88-89; Springer v. United
States, 102 U. S. 586, 594; Hagarv. Reclamation District
No. 108, 111 U. S. 701, 708-709. Property rights must
yield provisionally to governmental need. Thus, while
protection of life and liberty from administrative action
alleged to be illegal, may be obtained promptly by the
writ of habeas corpus, UnitedStates v. Woo Jan, 245 U. S.
552; Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U. S. 276, the statutory
prohibition of any "suit for the purpose of restraining
the assessment or collection of any tax" postpones redress
through the various favorite methods recognized by everyone prior
to the 1926 Act. The enforcement of the liability through court
process had been ineffective and the amount of revenue lost througl
mala ide transfers or through corporate distribution of assets was
admittedly large."

Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 615; Springer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586,
593; Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U. S. 118, 120; Graham v. du Pont, 262
U. S. 234, 255. The earliest federal excise tax acts contained provisions for suit, or levy by distraint and sale. e. g., Act of March 3,
1791, c. 15, § 23, 1 Stat. 199, 204; Act of December 21, 1814,
c. 15, § 5, 3 Stat. 152, 154; Act of January 9, 1815, c. 21, § 26, 3
Stat. 164, 173; Act of January 18, 1815, c. 22, § 5, 3 Stat. 180, 182;
id., c. 23, § 9, 3 Stat. 186, 188. Similarly, a tax lien on lands and
chattels was early introduced. Act of July 22, 1813, a. 16, § 19, 3
Stat. 22, 30; Act of January 9, 1815, c. 21, § 24, 3 Stat. 164, 172.

for the alleged invasion of property rights if the exaction
is made under color of their offices by revenue officers

Proceedings more summary in character than that provided in § 280, and involving less directly the obligation of the taxpayer, were sustained in Murray's Lessee
v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272. It
is urged that the decision in the Murray case was based
upon the peculiar relationship of a collector of revenue
to his government. The underlying principle in that
case was not such relation, but the need of the government promptly to secure its revenues.
Where only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial enquiry is not a denial of due

v. Amsden, 56 Vt. 201, 206-07. Compare McMillen v. Anderson, 95
U. S. 41.
6 Rev. Stat. § 3224. There is no substantial relaxation of this
principle in the provision that, while an appeal is pending before the
Board of Tax Appeals, no proceeding by distraint may be taken, and,
notwithstanding Rev. Stat. § 3224, such proceeding may be enjoined. Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, § 274 (a), 44 Stat. 9, 55;
Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852, § 272 (a), 45 Stat. 791, 852; Peerless
Woolen Mills v. Rose, 28 F. (2d) 661. For even in such case, if
the Commissioner believes the assessment or collection of the tax
will be endangered by delay, he may make an immediate jeopardy
assessment and collect by distraint unless the taxpayer files a bond.
Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, § 279, 44 Stat. 9, 59; Act of May 29,

process, if the opportunity given for the ultimate judicial
determination of the liability is adequate. Springer v.
United States, 102 U. S. 586, 593; Scottish Union & National Ins. Co. v. Bowland, 196 U. S. 611, 631. Delay in
the judicial determination of property rights is not uncommon where it is essential that governmental needs be
immediately satisfied. For the protection of public
health, a State may order the summary destruction of
property by administrative authorities without antecedent
notice or hearing. Compare North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U. S. 306; Hutchinson v. Valdosta, 227 U. S. 303; Adams v. Milwaukee, 228 U. S. 572,

citizens may be summarily seized in war-time. Central
Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, 254 U. S. 554, 566; Stoehr v.

acquire property by eminent domain, without paying, or
determining the amount of the compensation before the
taking. Compare Kohl v. UnitedStates, 91 U. S. 367, 375;
United States v. Jones, 109 U. S. 513, 518; Crozier v.
Fried. Krupp Aktiengesellschaft, 224 U. S. 290, 306.'
The procedure provided in § 280 (a) (1) satisfies the
requirements of due process because two alternative
methods of eventual judicial review are available to the
transferee. He may contest his liability by bringing an
action, either against the United States or the collector, to
recover the amount paid. This remedy is available where
the transferee does not appeal from the determination of

the Commissioner, and the latter makes an assessment
and enforces payment by distraint; or where the transferee voluntarily pays the tax and is thereafter denied
administrative relief. Compare United States v. Emery,
Bird, Thayer Realty Co., 237 U. S. 28, 31; Wickwire v.
Reinecke, 275 U. S. 101, 105; Williamsport Wire Rope
Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 551, 560. Or the transferee may avail himself of the provisions for immediate
redetermination of the liability by the Board of Tax Appeals, since all provisions governing this mode of review
are made applicable by § 280. Compare Routzahn v.
Tyroler, 36 F. (2d) 208, 209. Thus within sixty days
after the Commissioner determines that the transferee is
liable for an unpaid deficiency, and gives due notice
thereof, the latter may file a petition with the Board of
Tax Appeals. Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, § 274 (a),
44 Stat. 9, 55; Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852, § 272 (a), 45
Stat. 791, 852. Formal notice of the tax liability is thus
given; the Commissioner is required to answer; and there
is a complete hearing de novo according to the rules of
evidence applicable in courts of equity of the District of
Columbia. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852, § 601, 45 Stat.
791, 872. Compare International Banding Machine Co.
v. Commissioner, 37 F. (2d) 660. This remedy may be
had before payment, without giving bond (unless the
Commissioner in his discretion deems a jeopardy assessment necessary). The transferee has the right to a preliminary examination of books, papers, and other evidence
of the taxpayer; and the burden of proof is on the Commissioner to show that the appellant is liable as a transferee of property, though not to show that the taxpayer
was liable for the tax. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852, § 602,

ment and collection meanwhile may be stayed by giving a bond to secure payment. Act of February 26,
1926, c. 27, § 1001, 44 Stat. 9, 109; Act of May 29,
1928, c. 852, § 603, 45 Stat. 791, 873. There may be
a further review by this Court on certiorari. These provisions amply protect the transferee against improper
administrative action.

Compare Hurwitz v. North, 271

U. S. 40.
It is argued that such review by the Board of Tax
Appeals and Circuit Court of Appeals is constitutionally
inadequate because of the conditions and limitations imposed. Specific objection is made to the provision that
collection will not be stayed while the case is pending
before the Circuit Court of Appeals, unless a bond is filed;
and also to the rule under which the Board's findings of
fact are treated by that court as final if there is any evidence to support them. As to the first of these objections, it has already been shown that the right of the
United States to exact immediate payment and to relegate
the taxpayer to a suit for recovery, is paramount. The
privilege of delaying payment pending immediate judicial
review, by filing a bond, was granted by the sovereign as
a matter of grace solely for the convenience of the tax1928, that is, after the 1928 Act was in effect, any allegcd defect
was cured.

this procedure is now thoroughly established.12 Questions of fact involved in proceedings against transferees

payer. 8 The alternative judicial review provided is
adequate in both cases.
Second. It is urged by amici curiae that the method of
assessment and collection permitted by § 280 (a) (1)
cannot be applied where, as in the case at bar, the transfer of assets, upon which the transferee's liability is based,
occurred prior to the enactment of the Revenue Act of
1926; and, moreover, that if applied retroactively to such
transfer, the section would be unconstitutional. The
power of Congress to provide an additional remedy for
the enforcement of existing liabilities is clear. Compare
Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 427. It is
clear also that Congress intended that the section should
be available for enforcing the liability of a transferee in
respect to taxes "imposed . . .by any prior income, excess-profits, or war-profits tax Act," irrespective of the
time at which the transfer was made. The need for a
more effective and expedient remedy was not limited to
liabilities of transferees thereafter arising. To have so
limited the operation of the section would, at least as to
earlier Acts, have seriously impaired the value of the new
remedy."

Casualty Co. v. Commissioner, 32 F. (2d) 940; Jacobs v. Commissioner, 34 F. (2d) 233; O'Meara v. Commissioner, 34 F. (2d) 390;

24 There is no suggestion in the Committee Reports on the 1926
Act that § 280 was to be so limited. A contrary intention is perhaps
indicated by subdivision (b) (2) which provided that where" the
period of limitation for assessement against the taxpayer expired
before the enactment of this Act but assessment against the taxpayer
was made within such period," the Commissioner should have six
years in which to make an assessment against the transferee, provided he could do so within one year after the enactment of the 1926

Third. It is contended that § 280 (a) (1) is invalid because the liability at law or in equity of a transferee is
dependent upon the law of the State of incorporation, and
that thus the section improperly delegates the federal taxing power to the state legislatures; and, further, that the
tax liability of the transferee, as thus assessed and collected, violates the constitutional requirement of uniformity because differences in state laws may affect such
liability. The extent and incidence of federal taxes not
infrequently are affected by differences in state laws; but
such variations do not infringe the constitutional prohibitions against delegation of the taxing power or the requirement of geographical uniformity. Florida v. Mellon, 273 U. S. 12, 17; Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U. S. 55;
Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U. S. 101, 117. Compare Head
Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 594; Clark Distilling Co. v.
Western Maryland Ry. Co. 242 U. S. 311, 327. We have,
therefore, no occasion to decide whether the right of the
United States to follow transferred assets is limited by
any state laws.
Fourth. It is contended that summary proceeding by
the United States to enforce the liability for the tax is
barred by the six months statute of limitations on suits
against stockholders provided by the Pennsylvania statute. Laws 1874, c. 32, § 15; Penn. Stat. (1920) § 5728.
The United States is not bound by state statutes of limiAct. Moreover, in all cases, an additional period of one year after
the expiration of the period for assessing the taxpayer, was given.
Compare H. R. Rep. No. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., February 22,
1926, p. 44. Subdivision (c) provides that in the case of corporations which had been dissolved, the period for assessment of the
transferee was to be the same as if such "termination of existence
had not occurred." These provisions clearly contemplated a dissolution and transfer of assets prior to the passage of the Act. Compare
United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489, 494. In the case at bar, two
assessments against the corporate taxpayer had been made prior to
1926.

States, 250 U. S. 123, 125; E. I. du Pont de Nemours &
Co. v. Davis, 264 U. S. 456, 462. The detailed limitation
periods specified in § 280 evidence the intention that they
alone shall be applicable to the proceedings therein
authorized.
Fifth. It is contended that, even if petitioners' are
liable, the amount determined is excessive; and that the
findings of the Board of Tax Appeals in the present case
are insufficient to support an assessment of the entire balance of the deficiencies. It is first urged that the estate
of Phillips can be assessed only for its pro rata share of
the deficiency, according to the ratio which the stock
held by him bore to the total outstanding stock of the
corporate taxpayer at the time of dissolution. The argument is that the federal Equity Rules require that all
stockholders be brought in as necessary parties and be
proportionately subjected to liability. While it is permissible for a respondent to bring in other stockholders
or transferees by a cross-bill,"5 this procedure is founded
upon the desire not to burden the courts with a multiplicity of suits. Compare Hatch v. Dana, 101 U. S. 205,
211. Such rule of convenience is not applicable in summary administrative proceedings like that provided by
§ 280 (a) (1). One who receives corporate assets upon
dissolution is severally liable, to the extent of assets received, for the payment of taxes of the corporation; and
other stockholders or transferees need not be joined. "

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

Non-joinder cannot affect or diminish the several liability
of the stockholder or transferee sued. Compare Benton
v. American National Bank, 276 Fed. 368." The individual several liability of Phillips may be fully enforced
by the United States in the present proceeding. Whatever the petitioners' right to contribution may be against
other stockholders who have also received shares of the
distributed assets, the Government is not required, in collecting its revenue, to marshal the assets of a dissolved
corporation so as to adjust the rights of the various stockholders. There is nothing in § 280 to indicate that Congress intended to limit the procedure in this way. And
any such requirement would seriously impair the efficiency
of the summary method provided.
Petitioners assert also that the finding of the Board
that the total assets of the corporation, amounting to
$68,588.35, were paid "to its stockholders between July
25, 1919 and September 27, 1919," is insufficient to support the assessment against the estate of the entire remaining deficiency of $9,306.36. The argument is that
there may have been several distributions within this
period; that since there was no finding as to the existence
of other creditors, it must be assumed that until the
assets had been depleted below the amount due for taxes,
the corporation was solvent; and that thus the stockholder-transferees did not become liable until the final
$9,306.36 of assets was distributed. Hence it is claimed
F. (2d) 321. See also Adams v. Perryman & Co., 202 Ala. 469; 80
So. 853; Singer v. Hutchinson, 183 Ill. 606, 620; 56 N. E. 388; Kimbrough v. Davies, 104 Miss. 722; 61 So. 697; Bartlett v. Drew, 57
N. Y. 587.
17 It was conceded below that if the other stockholders are insolvent,
or absent from the jurisdiction, or cannot be ascertained, they need
not be joined. Compare Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 506;
Second National Bank of Erie v. Georger, 246 Fed. 517, 520; United
States v. Armstrong, 26 F. (2d) 227, 233.

Syllabus.

that Phillips' liability for the tax is limited to a pro rata
share of the assets finally distributed, that is, to one quarter of the unpaid deficiency. But the plain import of the
findings is that there was a single distribution which took
several months to complete; and there is no question
that the entire assets were thereby distributed. Moreover, such argument, urged for the first time here, comes
too late. For while the burden was on the Commissioner
to prove before the Board that Phillips was liable as a
transferee, the facts in the case at bar were stipulated;
and it was agreed that the date of complete liquidation
was September 27, 1919, by which time petitioners' decedent had received his full share of the distributed assets.
Since it was stipulated that the final transfers of assets
were without consideration; that they, completely exhausted the corporate assets; that the balance of the deficiencies, assessed against the corporation, remains unpaid; and that the distributive dividend fceived by
Phillips was in excess of the remaining tax liability, the
burden resting upon the Commissioner was sustained.
Affirmed.
