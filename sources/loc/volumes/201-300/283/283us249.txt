Syllabus.

And, as the latter tax was in lieu of the capital stock tax
imposed by § 1000 of the 1918 Act, it reasonably may be
said that the income tax imposed by § 243 was intended
to be in lieu of the capital stock tax of § 1000 of the 1918
Act.
This income tax was one" corresponding" to the capital
stock tax under § 1000 of the 1918 Act within the meaning of § 1400 (b). And under that provision the last
mentioned tax remained in force until the former took
effect. The income tax imposed by § 243 was "for the
calendar year 1921." Section 1400 (b) makes it plain
that there was no intention to subject insurance companies
to both taxes for the same period. The 1921 Act operated
to cancel or remit the capital stock tax for that year. The
company is entitled to recover the amount collected for
that period.

APPEAL from a decree Of the District Court of three
judges dismissing a bill to enjoin the enforcement of
statutes regulating the size of freight train and switching crews.

Mr. Edward J. White, with whom Mr. Thos. B. Pryor
was on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Donald R. Richberg, with whom Messrs. Hal L.
Norwood, Attorney General of Arkansas, Joe Joiner,
ChesterHolland, and W. D. Jackson were on the brief, for
appellees.
MR. JUSTIcE BUrLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The company sued the attorney general and the prose-

cuting attorneys of two circuits of Arkansas to enjoin the
enforcement of statutes of that State regulating freight
train crews and switching crews upon the claim that they
are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United
States. On the complaint and supporting affidavits the
plaintiff applied for a temporary injunction. Defendants
moved to dismiss. The court, consisting of a circuit judge
and two district judges, held the complaint insufficient to
show any ground for relief and dismissed the case. 42 F.
(2d) 765.
The statutes so assailed are Laws, 1907, Act 116, and
Laws, 1913, Act 67 (§§ 8577-8579 and 8583-8586, Crawford & Moses' Digest, 1921) which so far as here material

are printed in the margin." The earlier Act requires railroad carriers whose lines are not less than 50 miles in
length to have not less than three brakemen in every crew
of freight trains of 25 cars or more. The later Act requires not less than three helpers in switch crews in yards
in cities of the first and second class operated by companies having lines of 100 miles or more.
The complaint asserts that each of these Acts violates
the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and the
'Arkansas

Laws, 1907, Act 116, provides:

"Section 1. No railroad company ... owning or operating any
line or lines of railroad in this State, and engaged in the transportation of freight over its line or lines shall equip any of its said
freight trains with a crew consisting of less than an engineer, a
fireman, a conductor and three brakemen, ....
"Section 2. This Act shall not apply to any railroad company
... whose line or lines are less than fifty miles in length, nor to
any railroad in this State, regardless of the length of the said lines,
where said freight train so operated shall consist of less than twenty-

five cars ...
"Section 3. Any railroad company ... violating any of the
provisions of this Act shall be fined for each offense not less than one
hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and each freight
train so illegally run shall constitute a separate offense ..
Arkansas Laws, 1913, Act 67, provides:
"Section 1. That no railroad company ... owning or operating any yards or terminals in the cities within this State, where
switching, pushing or transferring of cars are made across public
crossings within the city limits of the cities shall operate their switch
. .. crews with less than one engineer, a fireman, a foreman and
three helpers.
"Section 3. The provisions of this Act shall only apply to cities
of the first and second class and shall not apply to railroad companies or corporations operating railroads less than one hundred miles
in length.
"Section 4. Any railroad company or corporation violating the
provisions of this Act shall be fined for each separate offense not less
than fifty dollars and each crew so illegally operated shall constitute
a separate offense."

due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment and is repugnant to the Interstate Commerce
Act as amended in 19202 and to the Railway Labor Act.'
But they have been held valid by this court as against the
claim of repugnancy to these clauses of the Constitution.
See Chicago, R. I. & Pac.Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, 219 U. S.
453, 459, 465, affirming 86 Ark. 412; 111 S. W. 456, as to
the Act of 1907, and St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co. v.
Arkansas, 240 U. S. 518, affirming 114 Ark. 486; 170 S. W.
580, as to the Act of 1913.
The first of these cases was decided in 1911. The court
held that the Act of 1907 is not a regulation of interstate
commerce and that upon its face it must be taken as having been enacted in aid of, and for the protection of those
engaged in, such commerce. It said that Congress might
have taken entire charge of the subject, but that it had
not done so and had not enacted regulations in respect of
the number of employees to whom might be committed
the management of interstate trains and that until it does
the statutes of the State, not in their nature arbitrary,
must control. The court found that, while under the
evidence there was admittedly room for controversy as to
whether the statute was necessary, it could not be said
that it was so unreasonable as to justify the court in adjudging it an arbitrary exercise of power. And it held
that, being applicable alike to all belonging to the same
class, there was no basis for the contention that it denied
the company equal protection of the laws. The principles
governing that decision were followed in the later case,
decided in 1916, which upheld the Act of 1913. Both Acts
were sustained as valid exertions of police power for the
promotion of safety of employees and others.
The plaintiff says that, since these decisions, Congress
has occupied the field and has delegated to the Commis2 U.

sion and Labor Board full authority over the subject and
that the state laws under consideration are repugnant to
the comprehensive scheme of federal regulation prescribed
by the Interstate Commerce Act as amended and conflict
with §§ 1 (10) and (21), 13, 15 and 15a thereof and with
the spirit of the Railway Labor Act of 1926.
It maintains that the allegations of the complaint together with the facts set forth in the affidavits show that,
when applied to operating conditions on its lines in
Arkansas, these state laws are arbitrary and violative of
the Federal Constitution and laws. But the affidavits
filed in support of the application for a temporary injunction may not be considered in determining whether the
complaint states facts sufficient to constitute ground for
relief. Leo v. Union Pac. Ry. Co., 17 Fed. 273. United
States v. Marine Engineers' Assn., 277 Fed. 830, 834.
McGregor v. Great Northern R. Co., 42 N. D. 269, 280;
172 N. W. 841.
The substance of the pertinent allegations of the complaint follows:
Present railroad operating conditions on plaintiff's railroad in Arkansas and elsewhere, and on railroads generally
in this country, differ from those that existed in 1907 and
1913 when these laws were passed. Roads and equipment
have been so improved that longer and heaver trains may
be operated more safely now than much smaller trains
could then be operated. It is standard practice of railroads "wherever the density of traffic is sufficient, except
in the State of Arkansas, to operate freight and passenger
trains and switch engines with crews consisting of less
than the extra switchmen [meaning one less than required
by the 1913 Act] and extra brakemen [meaning one less
than required by the 1907 Act] provided by the Arkansas
laws."
Freight trains and switch engines are safely operated
on lines similar to those of plaintiff "wherever the traffic

Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

and circumstances make such operation advisable, without such extra switchmen and extra brakemen." By increasing lengths of their freight trains, the plaintiff and
other railroads in States "where such extra brakemen and
extra switchmen are not [by law] required" have been
able to effect great economies. But by the Arkansas laws
plaintiff is compelled there to employ more than the
standard crew and to pay for services and time not needed
or ,used for the operation of its freight trains.
The standard agreement between plaintiff and the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen provides for a switch
crew consisting of a foreman and two helpers and "also
provides for a . . . freight train crew, in through and
irregular freight service, of a conductor and two brakemen." Other railroads have similar agreements with the
Brotherhood "with the exception of the service in States
with laws similar to the above laws of the State of
Arkansas."
And it is alleged that, if plaintiff were permitted to
operate its freight trains without the extra brakemen
required by the Act of 1907, its expenses would be reduced
by $350,000 per year; and, if permitted to operate its
switch engines without the extra helper required by the
Act of 1913, its expenses would be reduced $250,000 per
year.
The complaint contains much by way of argument, assertions as to questions of law together with inferences
and conclusions of the pleader as to matters of fact. These
are not deemed to be admitted by motion to dismiss.

Oil Corp. v. Hope, 248 U. S. 498, 500. The state laws are
presumed valid. Moreover, in the cases here decided they
were held not repugnant to the commerce clause of the
Constitution or the due process or equal protection clause

of the Fourteenth Amendment. The burden is on the
plaintiff by candid and direct allegations to set forth in
its complaint facts sufficient plainly to show the asserted
invalidity. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, 275 U. S.440.
447, and cases there cited. N. 0. Public Service v. New
Orleans, 281 U. S. 682, 686. Beaumont, S. L. & W. Ry.
v. United States, 282 U. S. 74, 88.

There is no showing that the dangers against which
these laws were intended to safeguard employees and the
public no longer exist or have been lessened by the improvements in road and equipment or by the changes in
operating conditions there described. And, for aught that
appears from the facts that are alleged, the same or
greater need may now exist for the specified number of
brakemen and helpers in freight train and switching crews.
It is not made to appear that the expense of complying
with the state laws is now relatively more burdensome
than formerly. Greater train loading tends to lessen
operating expenses for brakemen. There is no statement
as to present efficiency of switching crews compared with
that when the 1913 Act was passed, but it reasonably may
be inferred that larger cars and heavier loading of today
make for a lower switching expense per car or ton. While
cost of complying with state laws enacted to promote
safety is an element properly to be taken into account in
determining whether such laws are arbitrary and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, (Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Commissioners, 278 U. S.
24, 34; Oregon R. R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild,224 U. S.510,
529), there is nothing alleged in that respect which is sufficient to distinguish this case from those in which we
have upheld the laws in question. And the claim that
"standard" crews are generally employed by the railroads of the United States is substantially impaired by
the qualified form of the allegations and also by the fact,

which we judicially notice, that other States have laws
somewhat similar to the Arkansas Act in question.' It is
clear that, so far as constitutionality is concerned, the
facts alleged are not sufficient to distinguish this case from
those in which this court has sustained these laws.
Has Congress prescribed, or authorized the Interstate
Commerce Commission to regulate, the number of brakemen to be employed for the operation of freight trains or
the number of helpers to be included in switching crews?
In the absence of a clearly expressed purpose so to do
Congress will not be held to have intended to prevent the
exertion of the police power of the States for the regulation of the number of men to be employed in such crews.

ject, insists that the Act does give the Commission juris-

diction over freight train and switching crews and so excludes the States from that field. It calls attention to a
number of provisions of the Act "and maintains that under
them the Commission is empowered to regulate the "practice" of carriers in respect of the "supply of trains" to be
provided by any carrier. But, assuming that the Act does
so authorize regulation in respect of such practice and supply, it is clear that the delegation of power would not
include the regulation of the number of brakemen or
helpers. The Act uses the word "practice" in connection
with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of
service to be rendered by the carriers, but these matters
differ widely in kind from the subject covered by the
Arkansas laws. That word is deemed to apply only to
acts or things belonging to the same class as those meant
by the words of the law that are associated with it. Baltimore & 0. R. Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 291, 300.
The Act does not use that word in respect of any subject.,
that reasonably may be thought similar to or classified
with the regulation of the number of men to be employed
in such crews. And it is also clear that there is nothing in,
the phrase "supply of trains" or in the purpose of the
Act to suggest that by it Congress intended to supersede
state laws like those under consideration. The plaintiff
further supports its contention by the claim that the Commission is authorized to regulate the expenditures of carriers. That claim is based on the provisions of the Act
empowering the Commission to regulate rates to be
charged and divisions of joint rates and to ascertain rate
levels that will yield the fair return provided for. But
manifestly there is no similarity between determining
what items of expense properly are to be taken into account in calculations made for such purposes and in the

prescribing of the number of employees or the compensation to be paid them. We think it very clear that Congress has not prescribed or empowered the Commission to
fix the number of men to be employed in train or switching
crews.
No analysis or discussion of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 is necessary to show that it does
not conflict with the Arkansas statutes under consideration.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 282.

Argued March 16, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. Section 281 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924, as amended March 3,
1925, provides that if a taxpayer has, on or before June 15, 1925,
filed a waiver of his right to have the tax due for the taxable year
1919 determined and assessed within five years after the return
was filed, then refund relating to such tax shall be made if claim
therefor is filed on or before April 1926. Held that it should be
construed liberally in favor of a taxpayer as to what amounts to
a claim for refund. P. 263.
2. Prior to the above amendment, the Commissioner had finally, upon
full information and consideration, determined that the taxpayer
had overpaid its tax in a stated amount, and he had then withheld a refund solely because the taxpayer had not complied with
§ 281 as it then stood. Soon after the amendment, the Commissioner notified the taxpayer that the overassessment could not
be allowed unless the taxpayer filed a waiver on or before June 15,
1925, as the amendment required, and he enclosed blanks for that
purpose. The taxpayer executed and returned the waiver before
that date, with a letter to the Commissioner saying that the
waiver was sent to him in accordance with his request. Held that
the Commissioner was warranted in accepting the waiver and the
letter transmitting it, with what went before, as amounting to the
filing of a claim within the meaning of the amendment. P. 263.
