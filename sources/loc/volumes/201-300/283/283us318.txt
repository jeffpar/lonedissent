the trial judge to ask prospective jurors something relative to racial prejudice. And certainly I am unable to
affirm that they were wrong.
Section 391 of the U. S. Code, I think, was intended to
prevent escape of culprits from prompt, deserved punishment in cases like this. Congress had clear right to put
the limitation on courts of review and the enactment
should be given effect according to its purpose.
Unhappily, the enforcement of our criminal laws is
scandalously ineffective. Crimes of violence multiply;
punishment walks lamely. Courts ought not to increase
the difficulties by magnifying theoretical possibilities. It
is their province to deal with matters actual and material;
to promote order, and not to hinder it by excessive theorizing of or by magnifying what in practice is not really
important.
I think the judgment below should be affirmed.

v. NEW, TRUSTEE IN BANK-

RUPTCY,

ET AL.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 137. Argued March 3, 1931.-Decided April 20, 1931.
1. Where creditors have obtained and docketed judgments constituting liens on the real estate of their debtor, and have instituted a
creditors' suit in a state court -to marshal the liens and enforce
them by a sale of the real estate, the bankruptcy of the
debtor, occurring more than four months after the institution
of the creditors' suit, does not oust the state court of jurisdiction,
nor vest in the court of bankruptcy power to enjoin further

proceedings in the state court. Pp. 320, 323.
2. The state court proceeding described in the certificate in this
case, when examined with the West Virginia statutes upon which
it is based, is found to be a suit by a judgment creditor for the
enforcement of the lien of his judgment on the debtor's real estate,

in which all liens of creditors on such real estate are ascertained
and marshalled and the realty sold for their satisfaction. It is
not of the class of proceedings under state insolvency laws which
are suspended by the Federal Bankruptcy Law. P. 327.

RESPONSE to a question certified, upon an appeal to
the court below from an order of the District Court, in
bankruptcy. The order enjoined commissioners of a
West Virginia court from selling certain real estate pursuant to its decree.

Mr. Randolph Bias for Straton et al.
Mr. Arthur F. Kingdon, with whom Mr. E. A. Hansbarger was on the brief, for New et al.
MR. JUSTIcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The District Court for Southern West Virginia entered
an order in the bankruptcy of the Fall Branch Coal Company enjoining commissioners appointed by a West Virginia state court from proceeding with the sale of certain
real estate of the bankrupt pursuant to a decree of that
court. The petitioners were the trustee in bankruptcy
and two mortgagees.
The petition alleged that the commissioners were advertising for sale only the property of the bankrupt in
West Virginia, that it would be advantageous to all parties
to have this property sold with property of the bankrupt
situate in Kentucky, and that the bankruptcy court had
exclusive jurisdiction to make the sale. The respondents
in their answer denied the right of the District Court to
enjoin -the proceedings in the state court, and appealed
from an order awarding an injunction.
April 11, 1927, one Alley obtained judgment against the
coal company in the Circuit Court of Mingo County, West
Virginia, which was docketed May 5, 1927, and thus be-

came a lien on its real estate in that county. Feoruary 20,
1928, Alley filed in the same court a judgment creditors'
suit against the coal company, and made parties thereto
all creditors having liens against its real estate, including
the two mortgagees who were co-petitioners with the
trustee in the bankruptcy court. In his bill he prayed
that the liens and assets be marshalled and that the company's real estate be sold and the proceeds distributed
among the lien claimants according to their respective
rights. The cause was duly matured and, at April term,
1928, was referred to a commissioner in chancery to report
the real estate owned by the debtor and the liens thereon.
At the July term, 1928, the commissioner presented his
report, and thereupon the respondents were appointed to
make sale of the property. August 4, 1928, sixteen months
after rendition of Alley's judgment, and five and one-half
months after the filing of the creditors' bill, the coal company filed its voluntary petition in bankruptcy, and on
October 11, 1928, while the commissioners of the state
court were proceeding to carry out its order of sale, the
petition was filed to enjoin them from further proceeding.
Upon these facts the question certified is:
Where creditors have obtained and docketed judgments
constituting liens on the real estate of defendant, and have
instituted a creditors' suit in a state court to marshal and
enforce the liens and sell the real estate subject thereto,
does the bankruptcy of defendant occurring more than
four months after the institution of the creditors' suit oust
the state court of jurisdiction, or vest in the court of
bankruptcy power to enjoin further proceedings in the
state court?
The purpose of the Bankruptcy Law, passed pursuant
to the power of Congress to establish a uniform system of
bankruptcy throughout the United States, is to place the
property of the bankrupt, wherever found, under the control of the court, for equal distribution among the

Opinion of the Court.

creditors. The filing of the petition is an assertion of
jurisdiction with a view to the determination of the status
of the bankrupt and a settlement and distribution of his
estate. This jurisdiction is exclusive within the field defined by the law, and is so far in rem that the estate is
regarded as in custodia legis from the filing of the petition.
Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., 222 U. S.

nor proceedings be had in other courts to reach the property, the district court having acquired the exclusive right
to administer all property in the bankrupt's possession.

Though a lien be not discharged by bankruptcy, its

more than four months old will be enjoined from enforcing its lien by suit brought after the date of the petition.!
And as the lien created by a judgment entered within
four months is avoided, the court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction to administer the property regardless of the lien
and will restrain the prosecution of an action to enforce it.,
The bankruptcy law contains no express provision preserving liens acquired by legal proceedings more than
four months before the petition is filed. But it is clearly
implied that they shall be saved from the operation of the
law, for ยง 67 (f)' voids only liens obtained by legal proceedings within that period. It has consequently been
held that those acquired earlier, if valid under state law,
are preserved, and will be accorded priority by the bankruptcy court in distribution of the estate, in accordance
with applicable local law."
There is no dispute concerning these propositions. Appellants, however, assert that the jurisdiction in bankruptcy to ascertain, marshal and enforce liens, is not
exclusive, but concurrent with that of other courts competent to that end, if the liens in question are not discharged but recognized as valid in bankruptcy, and that
the rule of comity is applicable that the court first lawfully
taking jurisdiction shall retain it. Wabash R. Co. v.

STRATON v. NEW.
318

Opinion of the Court.

Adelbert College, 208 U. S. 38. Harkin v. Brundage, 276
U. S. 36. They contend that when the petition was filed
in this case, the state court was proceeding in a suit within
its jurisdiction and had taken possession of the res for the
purpose of enforcing such a lien.
The certificate states that the judgment of the plaintiff
in the creditors' suit constituted a lien on real estate from
a date sixteen months prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding. It is obvious that it and any other
judgments involved in that suit, and the mortgage liens
which were to be marshalled in it, including those of the
two mortgagees who joined in the petition for injunction
against further action by the state court, were valid notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because the creditors' suit
was filed five and one-half months before the petition in
bankruptcy, and all such other judgments and liens must
then have been in existence and matured, or they would
not have been proper subjects for the state court's action.
If appellants are correct in their contention that the
creditors' suit was no more than a proceeding to enforce
liens saved from discharge by the subsequent bankruptcy
of the debtor, it follows, as they claim, that the District
Court sitting in bankruptcy had no power to enjoin that
action.
In Metcalf v. Barker, 187 U. S. 165, Lesser Brothers
were adjudged bankrupts on their own petition, on May
12, 1899. They had on October 2, 1896, being insolvent,
transferred all their property, partnership and individual,
to certain favored creditors. On October 22, 1896, and
October 29, 1896, Metcalf recovered judgments in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against the Lessers,
upon which executions were issued and returned unsatisfied. On December 17, 1896, Metcalf commenced a judgment creditors' action in the Supreme Court of New York,
which came to trial on December 17, 1897, as a result

OCTOBER TERM. 1930.

283 U.S.

whereof the transfers were adjudged fraudulent and void
as to plaintiff. The transfers had involved both personal
property and real estate. The judgment of the court set
aside the transfers of personal property and of the real
estate in favor of the plaintiff. Meantime receivers had
been appointed for the Lessers and the judgment of the
Supreme Court determined that the tangible property and
its proceeds then in the hands of the receivers, and certain
claims by the receivers, were to be administered by them
for the benefit of the creditors of the partnership, including Metcalf, while the real estate involved became subject to the lien of the judgments of Metcalf as of October
22 and 29, 1896.
From this judgment there were appeals, as a result of
which the decree in favor of Metcalf did not become final
until March 12, 1900. On March 8, 1900, the trustee in
bankruptcy procured from the United States District
Court an order on Metcalf to show cause why an injunction should not issue enjoining him from taking any
further proceedings under any judgment in the creditors'
action. Objection was made to the jurisdiction of the
court, which was overruled, and the injunction made
permanent. Metcalf presented a petition to revise to the
Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified to this Court
certain questions, amongst others, whether the District
Court had jurisdiction to make the injunction order, and
whether Metcalf, by the commencement of the creditors'
action, acquired a lien on the property of the bankrupts
superior to the title of the trustee. This Court answered
that the District Court had no jurisdiction, and that Metcalf did acquire such a lien.
The bill was a technical creditors' bill; its purpose was
to subject equitable assets to the lien of a judgment which
the judgment did not bind at law. This Court held that
the lien when established related back to the date of the
filing of the bill, which was much more than four months

Opinion of the Court.

before the initiation of the cause in bankruptcy. It was
urged that at the date of bankruptcy the claim was contingent and was only an equitable lien, and that in truth
and in substance the judgment was recovered within four
months of bankruptcy, and under ยง 67 (f) must be declared null and void. This Court overruled the contention, quoted ยง 67 (f), and said (p. 174):
"In our opinion the conclusion to be drawn from this
language is that it is the lien created by a levy, or a judgment, or an attachment, or otherwise, that is invalidated,
and that where the lien is obtained more than four months
prior to the filing of the petition, it is not only not to be
deemed to be null and void on adjudication, but its validity is recognized. . . . A judgment or decree in enforcement of an otherwise valid preexisting lien is not the
judgment denounced by'the statute, which is plainly confined to judgments creating liens."
In Clarke v. Larremore, 188 U. S. 486, a judgment was
recovered, but did not constitute a lien on the debtor's personal property. Within four months prior to the filing of
a bankruptcy petition the judgment creditor issued execution under which levy was made on the debtor's goods.
It was held that the levy and the sale thereunder were
avoided. The Court said: "The judgment in favor of
petitioner against Kenney was not like that in Metcalf v.
Barker, . . . one giving effect to a lien theretofore existing, but one which with the levy of an execution issued
thereon created the lien ... "
In Globe Bank v. Martin, 236 U. S. 288, the Court said:
"The difference, having the provisions of the act in view,
between the beginning of a proceeding to assert liens that
existed more than four months before the filing of the
petition in bankruptcy, and the attempt to create them
by attachment or other proceedings within four months,
has been recognized in decisions of this court" (citing
Metcalf v. Barker).

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

Following these cases the federal courts have with practical unanimity held that where a judgment which constitutes a lien on the debtor's real estate is recovered more
than four months prior to the filing of the petition, the
bankruptcy court is without jurisdiction to enjoin the
prosecution of the creditor's action, instituted prior to the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy, to bring about a judicial
sale of the real estate.6

Opinion of the Court.

The trustee in bankruptcy may intervene in such suits
to protect the interests of the estate.!
It is clear that if the action in the state court was merely
in the nature of an execution or proceeding to obtain the
avails of the judgment lien it should not have been
enjoined by the district court.
The appellees, however, insist that the purpose and
function of the creditors' bill was a general disposition
and distribution of the debtor's propert y; that it was a
winding up proceeding pursuant to state law, and was
therefore superseded by the bankruptcy. They invoke
the settled rule that state insolvency laws which are tantamount to bankruptcy because they provide for an administration of the debtor's assets and a winding up of
his affairs similar to that provided by the national act are
suspended while the latter remains in force, and proceedings under them are utterly null and void whether commenced within four months of the filing of a petition in
bankruptcy or before. Sturges v. Crowninshield,4 Wheat.

It was pointed out in Stellwagen v. Clum, supra, that
state laws which provide for sale and distribution of a
debtor's property may not amount to insolvency laws;
and it was there held that such laws, if not inconsistent
with the administration of the bankruptcy act, are available to litigants. Appellees must therefore show that the

statutory action in the state court is, in fact, an insolvency
proceeding. The certificate states no facts which lead to
such a conclusion, nor does it so denominate the creditors'
suit. Reference to the statutes of West Virginia, of which
we take judicial notice, demonstrates that it is not in that
category.
In that State a judgment is a lien on the debtor's real
estate as against all except bona fide purchasers for value
without notice, and as against the latter from the date of
docketing it in the county where the land lies.' The
debtor's real estate cannot be sold under execution. In re
McGraw, 254 Fed. 442. The plaintiff must resort for enforcement of his judgment against real estate to such a
proceeding as is described in the certificate.9 He may
do so without exhausting his legal remedies, as against
personal property.10 The statute provides for a course of
procedure such as is described in the certificate,-namely,
that the liens and the debtor's real estate shall be determined by a commissioner appointed by the court and, if

after an execution or fieri facias thereon has been duly returned to

Opinion of the Court.

the claims which he reports be not paid, a decree shall be
made for a sale of the real estate subject to the liens so
far as may be necessary to pay them according to their
priorities, if any. If a lien-holder, after notice has been
given of the proceeding as required by the statute, does
not appear and present his claims he is barred from participation, except that if a surplus remain after the payment of claims presented he may share in such surplus
upon proving his claim at any time before final decree.
There is also a provision for the presentation and participation of lien claims where judgment has been recovered
before final decree in the creditors' action. This statute
says nothing about a distribution of assets amongst general creditors. It contains no provision that lien claims
presented which cannot be paid because the proceeds of
the sale are insufficient shall be wiped out as debts of the
defendant. It doesnot purport to discharge the debtor
from his indebtedness generally. It is merely a proceeding in equity to do what would be done by a sheriff or
marshal under an appropriate writ for the sale of real
estate in execution at law. In re McGraw, supra. Such
officer upon receiving the proceeds of a judicial sale would
under the supervision of the court pay them to those
whose liens were discharged by the sale. He would marshal the liens against the proceeds precisely as this statute
directs the chancellor to do. The act is in no sense an
insolvency statute, and a proceeding thereunder is not
therefore avoided by the adjudication of the debtor as a
bankrupt. On the contrary, it is a mere proceeding to
enforce a valid lien or liens against the real estate bound
thereby, and falls within the rule announced in Metcalf v.
Barker, supra.11 This is the view of the Supreme Court
' The bill in Metcalf v. Barker was a true creditors' bill, seeking
to make available to a judgment creditor assets which could not be
reached by an execution at law. Jones v. Green, 1 Wall. 330; Dunphy

of West Virginia, which has held that the action is merely
one to enforce liens, and that where the bankruptcy of
the debtor occurred six months after its institution, it
need not be stayed, since the state court which had first
acquired jurisdiction was entitled to proceed to final decree. Abney Barnes Co. v. Davy-Pocahontas Coal Co.,
83 W. Va. 292; 98 S. E. 298.
It is suggested that the commissioners appointed by the
state court were in effect receivers, and it was stated in
argument that they did not qualify by giving bond until
within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and that therefore the state court action should
be enjoined and the property taken into possession of the
bankruptcy court. But as above said, the statute of West
Virginia merely substitutes these commissioners for the
usual judicial officer who makes a sale and reports the
result thereof to the court."
Assuming them to be receivers, their function is not
that of an officer charged with winding up the affairs of
the debtor, such as would cause a conflict with the bankruptcy law.1 Moreover, we find nothing in the certificate
to the effect that the commissioners had not qualified more
than four months prior to the filing of the petition in the
bankruptcy court.
The appellees rely upon In re Watts, 190 U. S. 1. But
that case does not support their contentions. It is suffiv. Kleinschmidt, 11 WaUl. 610, 614; Taylor v. Bowker, 111 U. S. 110,
116; National Tube Works Co. v. Ballou, 146 U. S. 517. The bill in
this case assumes the existence of the lien on the property and is a
mere measure to enforce it.

cient to say that, there a state court made an order appointing a general receiver for a corporation. He proceeded to
inventory and appraise the assets of the debtor, asked for
orders requiring the creditors to prove their claims, and
was proceeding to a complete winding up. Within a
month and a half after the appointment a petition in
bankruptcy was filed. This Court said:
"We do not understand it to be contended that the passage of the bankruptcy act in itself suspended the statute
of Indiana in relation to the appointment of receivers, but
only that when the proceedings for such appointment took
the form, as they did here, of winding up the affairs of the
insolvent corporation, the proceedings in bankruptcy displaced those in the sfate court and terminated the jurisdiction of the latter."
This was merely a statement of the well settled principle that a general winding up receivership is tantamount
to an insolvency proceeding which will be superseded by
bankruptcy, and, a fortiori, if, as in that case, the petition
is filed within four months of the appointment of the
receiver. The language quoted from that case by appellees respecting the paramount and exclusive jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy must be read in connection
with the facts on which it was predicated.
Most of the cases cited by the appellees to the effect
that the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings confers on
the district court jurisdiction to enjoin pending suits in
state courts deal with the situation where a lien was acquired within four months of the filing of the petition, or
where, after the filing of the petition an action was begun
to enforce a lien valid in bankruptcy. As heretofore
noted, there are a few cases which have held that the bankruptcy court may enjoin proceedings, brought prior to the
filing of the petition, to enforce valid liens which are more
than four months old at the date of bankruptcy; "' but
