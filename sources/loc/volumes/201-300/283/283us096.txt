APPEAL FROM AND CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
MISSISSIPPI.

No. 195.

Argued March 6, 9, 1931.--Decided April 13, 1931.

1. The protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against state action
is only for the benefit of those who are injured through the invasions of personal or property rights, or through the discriminations, which the Amendment forbids. The constitutional guaranty
does not extend to the mere interest of an official, as such, who
has not been deprived of his property without due process of law
or denied the equal protection of the laws. P. 99.
So held where a state official, suing a railway company in the
state court to collect a tax, which had been reduced by an amendatory law relied on by the company, attacked the amendment upon
the ground that the bill therefor had not been published as required by the state constitution, and where the state supreme
court, ignoring that contention, adjudged the amendment invalid
under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

MR. CHIEF JusTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
On behalf of the Mississippi Levee District, the State
Tax Collector of Mississippi sued the Columbus & Greenville Railway Company to collect a tax for the years 1926
and 1927, under chapter 282 of the Laws of Mississippi of
1914, at the rate of $350 a mile on its main line within the
District. The Railway Company had paid the tax at the
rate of $50 a mile, pursuant to the provisions of an amending act, chapter 259 of the Laws of 1926, which fixed the
tax at that rate for a railroad having less than twentyfive miles of main line within the district. The Railway
Company fell within the amendment, as its main line in
the district was only 18.41 miles in length. The Collector
alleged in his declaration that the Act of 1926 was unconstitutional and void because the bill providing therefor
had not been published, in advance of introduction, as
required by section 234 of the state constitution. Demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the Circuit Court

of Montgomery County, but its judgment was reversed
by the Supreme Court of the State upon the ground that
the classification by the Act of 1926 was "arbitrary and
unreasonable, and therefore in violation of the due process
and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution." 154 Miss. 317; 122
So. 366.
The Railway Company then pleaded that it was not
indebted, and gave notice that it would undertake to show.
that the classification of the Act of 1926 was valid, and,
further, that the statute laying the tax demanded by the
plaintiff, that is, the Act of 1914, was itself unreasonable
and violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon the
trial, evidence offered by the defendant in support of
these allegations was received subject to objection which
the Circuit Court finally sustained, and judgment was
entered for the amount of the tax on the basis of $350 a
mile. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court
of the State in the view that the case was ruled by its
previous opinion and that the excluded evidence, if competent, could not have changed the result. 127 So. 784.
An appeal was taken to this Court and a motion to dismiss or affirm was postponed to the hearing on the merits.
At the same time, this Court granted a writ of certiorari.

That part of the State of Mississippi, known as the
Mississippi Delta, is divided into two districts, the Mississippi Levee District and the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta
Levee District, to the end that each district may maintain
the levees necessary to protect the lands within it. The
Mississippi Levee District, created in 1865, comprises the
southern part of the Delta. It is said that four methods
of taxation are used to maintain this district, an acreage
tax, a cotton tax, an ad valorem tax on property generally, and a mileage tax on railroad companies which it
appears is in lieu of the ad valorem tax. Miller v. Yazoo
& Mississippi Valley R. Co., 160 Miss. -; 132 So. 597.

Opinion of the Court.

Prior legislation providing for the mileage tax on railroads was amended by chapter 282 of the Laws of 1914 so
as to impose a tax of $350 a mile on the main line of
standard gauge railroads within the district, $87.50 a mile
on narrow gauge railroads, and $210 a mile on standard
gauge branch lines. Chapter 259 of the Laws of 1926
added to the statute the following proviso: "provided
further that the tax per mile per annum on the main line
of any railroad company which does not own in excess of
twenty-five miles of railroad in the Mississippi Levee
District shall be $50 per annum." The Supreme Court of
the State, holding that this proviso was invalid under the
Fourteenth Amendment, did not deem it necessary to
decide whether this ruling invalidated merely the proviso
or the entire Act of 1926, as in either event the tax to be
paid would be the same.
We are not concerned with any question of the State's
policy in imposing taxes, or with the various methods employed in the levee district, apart from the application
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question as to the
validity of the Act of 1926 is raised only by the State Tax
Collector in his official capacity, as one acting solely under
the authority of the legislature whose requirement he contests. The only person taxed by the statute whose rights
are before the Court is the petitioner, which seeks to uphold the state legislation which defines its liability and
with which it has complied. The questions which the
Collector sought to raise under the state constitution have
not been passed upon by the state court. While, so far as
state practice is concerned, the authority of a public officer
to assail in the courts of the State the constitutional validity of a state statute is a local question,1 this fact does not
alter the fundamental principle, governing the determination of the federal question by this Court, that the protecSmith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138, 148; Huntington v. Worthen, 120

tion of the Fourteenth Amendment against state action
is only for the benefit of those who are injured through the
invasions of personal or property rights or through the
discriminations which the Amendment forbids.2 The constitutional guaranty does not extend to the mere interest
of an official, as such, who has not been deprived of his
property without due process of law or denied the equal
protection of the laws.'
Apart from this consideration, the only question presented is whether the Act of 1926 with its proviso, or the
proviso alone, is invalid upon its face. The evidence offered to support the classification was excluded, and was
treated as being in any event without effect, and the case
thus stood before the state court upon the bare terms of
the statute. If the facts shown by the evidence, thus excluded, were treated as established (Fairmont Creamery
Company v. Minnesota, 274 U. S. 1, 5), they would have
no tendency to invalidate the statute, but rather to sustain it. It appears that there are only two main lines of
railroad within the district, that of the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, extending north and
south through the entire levee district parallel .with the
Mississippi River, and that of the petitioner running east
from the Mississippi River. The petitioner sought to
show not only the difference in location but that the condition of its road and its equipment was inferior to that
of the other railroad. The petitioner also offered to
prove, and the fact was stipulated subject to objection,
that the State Tax Commission had assessed for ad va'Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114, 118; Standard Stock Co. v.

Opinion of the Court.

lorem taxes the railroad of the petitioner within the levee
district at $1,000 a mile, and that of the other railroad at
$32,000 a mile and, further, that in the classification of
railroads by the State Railroad Commission for the purpose of levying a privilege tax, the petitioner was placed
with respect to its main line in class three and the other
railroad in class one.
Without attempting to appraise the excluded evidence
with respect to the asserted differences between the two
railroads, it is sufficient to say that, if this evidence be
disregarded, the record shows no factual basis for holding
the classification of the statute invalid other than the
simple fact that the classification is according to mileage.
But the mere selection by the state legislature, in the
exercise of its broad discretion in the imposition of taxes,'
of a mileage basis, and the establishment of a particular
class of railroads having less than twenty-five miles of
main line within the district, cannot be regarded, in the
absence of any further showing, as arbitrary and as constituting a violation of the Federal Constitution. On
the contrary, a classification of this sort has frequently
been sustained. In Dow v. Beidelman, 125 U. S. 680, 691,
a statute classifying railroads according to mileage, with
respect to the passenger fares to be charged, was sustained. The Court said: "Whether the classification
shall be according to the amount of passengers and
freight carried, or of gross or net earnings, during a previous year, or according to the simpler and more constant
test of the length of the line of the railroad, is a matter
within the discretion of the legislature." To the same
effect is Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Conley, 230 U. S.
513. Similar rulings have been made in upholding other
regulatory statutes; e. g. a statute relating to the heating
of passenger cars but not applying to railroads less than

fifty miles in length (New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co. v. New York, 165 U. S. 628, 633, 634), and
statutes requiring a minimum number of men in train
crews but not applying to railroads of less than a stated
mileage. (Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v.

Southern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, 240 U. S. 518.) See, also,
Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 354.
As we find no ground for holding the Act of 1926 to be
invalid under the Federal Constitution, it is unnecessary
to consider the questions discussed in relation to the Act
of 1914.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

Argued March 13, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. Whether a gift inter vivos was made "in contemplation of death"
within the meaning of the Revenue Act of 1918, depends upon the

donor's motive, to be determined in each case from the circumstances, including his bodily and mental condition. Pp. 115, 119.
2. A gift is made "in contemplation of death" when the motive inducing it is of the sort that leads to testamentary disposition, but
not when the motive is merely to attain an object desirable to the
donor in his life, as where the immediate and moving cause of
transfers was the carrying out of a policy, long followed by the
decedent in dealing with his children, of making liberal gifts to them
during his lifetime. Pp. 117, 119.
3. A transfer may be "in contemplation of death" though not in-.
duced by a fear that death is near at hand. Pp. 113, 119.
4. Upon review of a judgment of the Court of Claims, the findings
of fact are to be treated like the verdict of a jury and cannot be
added to or modified by reference to that court's opinion. P. 120.
