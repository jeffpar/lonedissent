reversed for the reasons given in No. 92. It is objected
that the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals was not
stayed, but was issued to the District Court and spread
upon its records and that therefore the case is finished.
But that does not defeat the jurisdiction of this Court.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS OF
CONNECTICUT.
No. 235.

Argued March 12, 1931.-Decided March 23, 1931.

The Employers' Liability Act gives a right of action to the employee,
or, in case of his death, to his personal representative for the
benefit of the widow and children, and provides that no action
shall be maintained unless commenced within two years from the
day the cause of action accrued. Held that the right of the
representative is derivative and depends upon the continuance of a
right in the injured employee at the time of his death, so that
where the right of the employee was extinguished before he died,
by the lapse of the prescribed period, there was no right in his
executor, on behalf of his widow and children. P. 56.

action "accrues." Reading Co. v. Koons, 271 U. S. 58;
Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Wells-Dickey Tr. Co., 275 U. S.
161.
The Act does not, in express terms, make the personal
representative's right to maintain an action dependent
upon the existence of a right of action in the decedent
immediately before he dies. It intends that in all cases
there shall be but one recovery for the wrongful act, and
that the dependents' right shall not be barred unless the
deceased had received satisfaction in his lifetime either
by settlement and adjustment or by adjudication in the
courts. Mellon v. Goodyear, 277 U. S. 335, distinguished.
True, at the time of his death, the decedent had no
right of action; but this was not due to an affirmative
extinguishment of his right, but to lapse of time, affecting
his right of action alone. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v.
Oliver, 261 Fed. 1.
The Act declares two distinct and independent liabilities resting upon the common foundation of a wrongful
injury, and based upon altogether different principles.
The cause of action created for the benefit of the dependents of an employee who dies as a result of his injuries is
not a representative right, but a separate and distinct
right which is vested in certain designated dependents. It
includes no damages which the employee might have
recovered in an action brought by him during his lifetime. It is for the loss and damage sustained by the relatives dependent upon the decedent. Michigan Central

MR. JusTIcE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a suit under the Employers' Liability Act for
negligently causing the death of Edward L. Flynn,
brought on May 15, 1929, by Flynn's executor for the
benefit of Flynn's dependent widow and children. It is
alleged that the injury was suffered on December 4, 1923,
and that it caused Flynn's death on September 1, 1928.

OCTOBER TERM. 1930.
Opinion of the Court..

283 U.S.

The defendant, respondent here, demurred to the declaration on the ground that, more than two years having
elapsed since the date when Flynn's cause of action accrued, his right to sue was barred, and that therefore the
suit could not be maintained. Act of April 22, 1908, c.
149, §§1, 6, 35 Stat. 65, 66. Act of April 5, 1910, c. 143,
§ 1, 36 Stat. 291. Code, Tit. 45, §§ 51, 56. The demurrer,
and judgment for the defendant, were sustained by the
Supreme Court of Connecticut. 111 Conn. 196; 149 Atl.
682. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 282
U. S. 821.
The Act of 1908 gives a right of action to the employee
or, in case of his death, to his personal representative for
the benefit of the widow and children, and provides that
no action shall be maintained "unless commenced within
two years from the day the cause of action accrued." § 6.
Obviously Flynn's right of action was barred, but it is
argued that the right on behalf of the widow and children is distinct; that their cause of action could not arise
until Flynn's death, and that therefore the two years did
not begin to run until September 1, 1928. But the argument comes too late. It is established that the present
right, although not strictly representative, is derivative
and dependent upon the continuance of a right in the injured employee at the time of his death. Michigan Central R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 70. On this ground
an effective release by the employee makes it impossible
for his administrator to recover. Mellon v. Goodyear,277
U. S. 335, 344. The running of the two years from the
time when his cause of action accrued extinguishes it as
effectively as a release, Engel v. Davenport, 271 U. S. 33,
38, and the same consequence follows. Our conclusion
that this action could not be brought is required by the
former decisions of this Court.
Judgment affirmed.
