OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Statement of the Case.

283 U.S.

sailings of its ships, the place where goods would be received, and the amount of its charges for the water transportation, manifestly did not constitute a common arrangement with the railroad for that transportation. The
respondent could take delivery and pay the rail charges
upon delivery without sacrificing its right to make, as it
did make, its own separate contract directly with the shipper pursuant to which the goods were received and the
payment made. The Government stresses the fact that
circulars were issued by the railroads as to the respondent's method of shipping and that shippers were generally
informed as to the way in which shipments from interior
points destined to Florida ports would be handled. But
this information merely gave the facts and did not alter
the transaction. The respondent did not forfeit its independence merely by making its service convenient, still
less by advising both the railroads and shippers of the
terms of its service.
Judgment affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Thomas A. Kane and George C. Vournas submitted the cause for petitioner.
Mr. Claude R. Branch, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom Solicitor General Thacher and
Messrs. Harry S. Ridgely and W. Marvin Smith were on
the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioner was arrested in New York on December
19, 1928, and after a hearing was ordered to be deported
to Greece, on the ground that he had remained in the
United States for a longer time than permitted under the
Immigration Act of 1924 or the regulations made under
it. He is a native of Greece; shipped from that country
as a seaman and arrived at New York on September 10,
1925, when he deserted, and has remained in this country
ever since, that is, for more than three years before the
arrest. He sued out a writ of habeas corpus, setting up
the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, § 34, 39
Stat. 874, 896, as a statute of limitation entitling him to
remain. The writ was ordered to be dismissed by the
District Court and the order was affirmed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 37 F. (2d)
1015, citing United States ex rel. Piccolella v. Commissirner of Immigration, 36 F. (2d) 1022, which in turn
cites United States ex rel. Rios v. Day, 24 F. (2d) 654.
A contrary decision was reached by the Circuit Court for
the Ninth Circuit in Carr, Director of Immigration, v.
Zaja, 37 F. (2d) 1016, and writs of certiorari were granted
by this Court.
Section 34 of the Act of 1917 provides that "any alien
seaman who shall land in a port of the United States contrary to the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be
unlawfully in the United States, and shall, at any time

. be taken into cus-

tody" and upon the conditions there stated shall be
deported. It may be assumed that under this statute the
time within which a seaman can be arrested for deportation is limited to three years from the date of entry. But
by the Immigration Act of May 26, 1924, c. 190, § 14, 43
Stat. 153, 162, "Any alien who at any time after entering
the United States is found to have been at the time of
entry not entitled under this Act to enter the United
States, or to have remained therein for a longer time than
permitted under this Act, or regulations made thereunder," is to be deported in the same manner as provided
for in §§ 19, 20, of the Immigration Act of 1917. It is
argued elaborately for the petitioner, and is conceded by
the Government, that § 34 of the earlier Act is not repealed by the later one. See § 25 of the latter. For
the purposes of this case we may assume this to be true,
and that, in accordance with this § 25, the earlier Act
§ 34 is in force if not inapplicable. But we cannot accept
the conclusion that deserting alien seamen are thereby
made a favored class to be retained in this country when
other aliens would be compelled to leave. "Any alien "
in § 14 of the Act of 1924 includes alien seamen on its
face and by the definition in § 28, ibid. It is obvious that
the petitioner, whether he entered rightfully or wrongfully, remained in the United States longer than he was
permitted to by the law. He deserted after the Act of
1924 was in effect. The regulations under §§ 15 and 19
allowed only sixty days to alien seamen permitted to
enter. If he entered without permission he was not entitled to more. It seems to us too clear to need argument
that the limitation of three years in § 34 of the Act of
1917 does not override or qualify the clear and definite
terms of § 14 of the Act of 1924. Those terms must prevail. Zurbrick v. Trinkof], 38 F. (2d) 811. United
States ex rel. Cateches v. Day, 45 F. (2d) 142.
Judgment affirmed.
