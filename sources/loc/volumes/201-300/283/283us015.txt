STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 87.

Argued January 29, 1931.-Decided March 2, 1931.

1. A finding by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in assessing
an estate tax, that a gift made by the decedent in his lifetime was
made in contemplation of death, is controlling when the tax is .called
in question, if not challenged by any fact appearing of record.
P. 19.
2. The Revenue Act of 1918, § 402, applies to gifts in contemplation
of death made before its passage. P. 19.
3. The inclusion of gifts made in contemplation of death in a single
class with decedents' estates to secure equality of taxation, and
prevent evasion of estate taxes, is a permissible classification of an
appropriate subject of taxation. P. 20.
4. A tax is not necessarily and certainly arbitrary because retroactively applied, but may be justified and upheld in such application
because of the particular circumstances. P. 21.
5. A gift in contemplation of death was made while the 1916 Revenue
Act was in force; the donor died after the effective date of the Act
of 1918; in assessing his estate for transfer tax the value of the
gift at the time of his death was included; and the tax on the
whole was levied at the rates of the 1918 Act, which were higher
than those of the Act of 1916. Held that the application of the
later rates, as respects the gift, was not unreasonable or unconstitutional, in view of the relations of such gifts to transfers by death and
the legislative policy of both Acts concerning them, established
before the gift was made. P. 20.
6. The application of the higher rate of the 1918 Act to gifts made
in contemplation of death while the 1916 Act was in force, does not
destroy the character of the tax as one on privileges, and so render
it unconstitutional as an unapportioned direct tax. P. 24.

Argument for Petitioners.

283 U.S.

Section 402 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1918 construed
in the light of recent decisions does not apply to the transaction here at issue.
If construed to tax a transfer made before the passage
of the Act, the section is unconstitutional. Nichols v.
Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531.
The retroactive application of § 402 (c) cannot be supported-as a necessary adjunct to the enforcement of the
general provisions of the statute taxing the net estates of
decedents.
In any event, the provisions of the Act fixing the measure of the tax on transfers under § 402 (c) are so arbitrary
and capricious as to violate the Fifth Amendment. The
tax thus retroactively applied was imposed at a rate approximately two and one-half times as great as that provided by the 1916 Act in effect at the time the gift was
made, and, moreover, was imposed upon the property not
at its value at the time of the gift nor at any time when it
was in the possession of the decedent, but at its value at
the time of his death, over three years after he had parted
with all interest therein. The tax is thus imposed upon
one entity, the estate of the decedent, in respect of property belonging to an entirely different entity, the donee of
the antecedent gift, and on the basis of a value bearing no
relation to any value of the property at any time while
owned by the decedent.
The retroactive application amounts to an unapportioned direct tax forbidden by §§ 2 and 9 of Art. I of the
Constitution.
A tax imposed upon the estate of a decedent, measured
by the value of property which he has long since disposed
of, is a direct tax and cannot properly be considered an
excise upon the transfer of property by death, where the
transfer was made prior to the passage of the Act purporting to impose the tax. 37 Harv. L. R. 694, 695; 26 Col.
L. R. 852, 858.

MILLIKEN v. UNITED STATES.
Argument for the United States.

The outstanding feature of a direct tax, as distinguished
from duties, imposts, and excises, is that of an absolute
and unavoidable demand. See Thomas v. United States,
192 U. S. 363, 371; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107,
151-152; South Carolinav. United States, 39 Ct. Cls. 257,
affirmed, 199 U. S. 437. This absolute and unavoidable
demand clearly exists when an attempt is made to tax a
transfer effected prior to the adoption of the taxing
statute. Levy v. Wardell, 258 U. S. 542.
The determination of the nature of the tax must regard
the substance of the exaction-its operation and effect as
enforced-and cannot depend upon the manner in which
the taxing scheme has been characterized. Kansas City
Ry. v. Kansas, 240 U. S 227, 231, and many other cases.
The applicability of the principles in Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, is not affected by the fact that the transfer in
the present case was made subsequently to the passage of
the 1916 Act.
The saving clause contained in § 1400 (b) of the 1918
Act does not operate to impose a tax upon the transaction
here in question.
The repeal of the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917,
coupled with the enactment of the 1918 Act, containing
analogous taxing provisions, but at different rates, cannot
be so construed as to relieve the later Act from the taint
of retroactivity when applied to a transfer completed prior
to its adoption.

General Thacher and Messrs. Claude R. Branch, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, Fred K. Dyar, Bradley
B. Gilman, and Erwin N. Griswold were on the brief, for
the United States.
The language of the statute leaves no doubt but that
Congress intended to tax a transfer in contemplation of
death, whether the transfer was made before or after the

283 U.S.

passage of the Act. The petitioners' argument as to the
construction of this section was not raised in the court
below and is not open for argument in this Court.
The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment does
not invalidate the application of § 402 of the Revenue
Act of 1918 in this case. The transfer was in contemplation of death. The tax, if levied upon a transfer made
after the date of the enactment of the statute, is constitutional. The tax is upon the testamentary disposition
of the decedent's property. A gift in contemplation of
death is a part of this disposition.
The fact that the transfer was made before the enactment of the statute does not render it arbitrary. The
statute was a continuance of similar provisions in the Revenue Act of 1916 which was in force when the transfer
was made. No tax was placed upon an act non-taxable
when done. That the transferor could not calculate the
exact rate of the tax when he made the gift does not
make the tax unconstitutional.
In any case, the property transferred is taxable at the
lower rate prescribed by the Revenue Act of 1916. Congress intended the estate tax provisions of the 1916 Act
to remain in force in every case until the provisions of the
1918 Act applied to the estate in that case.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case certiorari was granted, 282 U. S. 817, to review a judgment of the Court of Claims denying to petitioners recovery of a tax alleged to have been illegally
exacted under the decedents' estates provisions of the
Revenue Act of 1918. 38 F. (2d) 381; Act of February
24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1097, 1149, 1150.
In December, 1916, while the Revenue Act of that year
was in force (Act of Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756,
777), petitioners' decedent gave to his children certain
shares of corporate stock. The donor died March 5, 1920,

MILLIKEN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

after the effective date of the 1918 Act. The Commissioner included the shares of stock in the decedent's estate
as a gift made in contemplation of death, § 402 (c)of
the 1918 Act, and assessed and collected the tax now in
suit, which was computed on the basis of the value of the
stock at the time of decedent's death, and at the rates in
the 1918 Act, which were higher than those fixed by the
corresponding provisions of the Act of 1916.
Section 401 of the 1918 Act imposed taxes at specified
rates upon transfers of estates by decedents. Under § 403,
the taxable estate was the "gross estate" less enumerated
deductions. Section 402 provided for the inclusion in the
gross estate of the value of property "(c) To the extent
of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any
time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at
any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his
death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created
before or after the passage of this act) . . ." The Act
of 1916, §§ 201, 202 (b), which had contained similar provisions for the taxing of decedents' estates, including gifts
in contemplation of death, but at lower rates, was repealed, with provisos not now material, by § 1400 of the
1918 Act.
The finding of the Commissioner that the present gift
was in contemplation of death is not questioned by petitioners, and is controlling here since it is not challenged
by any facts appearing of record. Niles Bement Pond Co.
v. United States, 281 U. S. 357, 361; Burnet v. Sanford &
Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359. Although antedating the enactment of § 402, the gift is embraced within its provisions,
which are in terms applicable to gifts in contemplation of
death made before the passage of the Act.
Petitioners' argument that § 402 does not apply is not
supported by their citations of Reinecke v. Northern Trust
Co., 278 U. S.339, and May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238. In

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 IT.S.

those cases the gifts inter vivos were not "in contemplation of death," and the only relevant question was one
of construction, whether some of them were of the class
intended by Congress to be taxable under § 402 (c) as
transfers "intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death." It was held that they were
not. But those gifts were not of the class now involved,
gifts in contemplation of death, made before the passage
of the .Act, which are expressly named by § 402 (c) as
subject to its provisions.
This Court has not passed directly on the constitutionality of the federal taxation of gifts made in contemplation of death. But taxation of transfers at death
has been upheld, Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, as
has, more recently, the taxation of gifts inter vivos, Bromley v. McCaughn, 280 U. S. 124; and we hold, as this
Court has several times intimated, that the inclusion of
this type of gifts in a single class with decedents' estates
to secure equality of taxation, and prevent evasion of
estate taxes, is a permissible classification of an appropriate subject of taxation. See Nichols v. Coolidge, 274
U. S. 531, 542; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, 505;
Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376, 378; Taft v. Bowers,
278 U. S. 470, 482; cf. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S.
230, 239.
The objection to the tax chiefly urged in brief and
argument, is that the taxing statute, as applied, is a denial
of due process of law because retroactive. It is said that
the statute is invalid not alone because it reaches a gift
made before its enactment, but because it measures the
tax by rates not in force when the gift was made, applied
to the value of the property not when given, but at the
uncertain later time of the death of the donor.
This Court has held the taxation of gifts made, and
completely vested beyond recall, before the passage of any
statute taxing them, to be so palpably arbitrary and un-

Opinion of the Court.

reasonable as to infringe the due process clause. Nichols
v. Coolidge, supra; Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440;
Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582.1 In Nichols v. Coolidge
it was held that § 402 of the 1918 Act could not constitutionally be applied to a gift inter vivos, not in contemplation of death, and made long before the adoption of
any congressional legislation imposing an estate tax or
taxing gifts to take effect 'in possession or enjoyment at or
after death. In 'Untermyer v. Anderson, supra, it was
held that the retroactive provision of the novel gift tax of
the Revenue Act of 1924 was invalid as applied to gifts
antedating the Act. In both the point was stressed, as
the basis of decision, that the nature and amount of the
tax burden imposed could not have been understood and
foreseen by the taxpayer at the time of the particular
voluntary act which was made the occasion of the tax.
See Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, p. 542; Untermyer v. Anderson, supra,p. 445. Upon similar grounds, in Coolidge
v. Long, supra, a state tax on successions was held invalid
as applied to the gift to the donor's children involved in
Nichols v. Coolidge, supra,because deemed to be a tax on
a succession to a gift completely vested before the enactment of the taxing act or of any other law taxing successions by lineal descendants of the donor.
But a tax is not necessarily and certainly arbitrary and
therefore invalid because retroactively applied, and taxing
acts having retroactive features have been upheld in view
of the particular circumstances disclosed and considered
by the Court. See Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, 20
Wall. 323, 331; Railroad Co. v. Rose, 95 U. S. 78, 80;
Railroad Co. v. United States, 101 U. S. 543, 549; Flint v.
Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107; Billings v. United States,
232 U. S. 261, 282; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co.,
In Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, four of the justices thought
the taxing statute inapplicable; and four that it applied, but was
unconstitutional because retroactive.

282 U. S. 409.
,Hence, in challenging the present tax it does not suffice
to say that the gift antedated the statute. It is necessary to consider the nature of the tax and of the decedent's
gift. When the gift was made it was subject to the pFovisions of the 1916 Revenue Act. By it, Congress had
adopted the well understood system of taxation of transfers of property at death, already in force in forty-two
states. Report No. 793, Senate Committee on Finance;
Report No. 922, House Committee on Ways and Means;
both on H. R. No. 16763, Sixty-fourth Congress. A
characteristic feature of the system was that incorporated
in §§ 202 (b) of the 1916 Act and 402 (c) of the 1918
Act, both of which imposed a tax on gifts made in contemplation of death, computed at the same value and
rate as though the property given had been a part of
the donor's estate passing at death.'
While we need not attempt at this time to define with
precision gifts in contemplation of death, their characteristic features have been sufficiently indicated by the various treasury regulations dealing with the subject. Regu2 In

1916, twenty-nine states and one territory imposed taxes on
gifts in contemplation of death at the same rate as on estates passing
at death. They were Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming,
and Hawaii. Most of these provided for appraisal of the value of
the property as of the date of decedent's death; but a few (Indiana,
Kansas, and Wisconsin) provided for valuation as of the date of
transfer. The statutes are collected in Gleason and Otis, Inheritance
Taxation (1st ed.).

MILLIKEN v. UNITED STATES.
15

Opinion of the Court.

lation 37 under the 1918 Act (Revised Aug. 8, 1919) is
typical. It provides (Art. 23): "The words 'in contemplation of death ' do not refer to the general expectation of death which all persons entertain. A transfer,
however, is made in contemplation of death wherever the
person making it is influenced to do so by such an expectation of death, arising from bodily or mental conditions, as prompts persons to dispose of their property to
those whom they deem proper objects of their bounty."
It is sufficient for present purposes, that such gifts are
motivated by the same considerations as lead to testamentary dispositions of property, and made as substitutes for such dispositions without awaiting death, when
transfers by will or inheritance become effective. Underlying the present statute is the policy of taxing such gifts
equally with testamentary dispositions, for which they
may be substituted, and the prevention of the evasion of
estate taxes by gifts made before, but in contemplation
of, death. It is thus an enactment in aid of, and an integral part of, the legislative scheme of taxation of transfers at death. Decedent's gift as a substitute for a testamentary disposition was thus brought within the operation of the 1916 Act taxing such gifts on the same basis,
with respect to rate and valuation, as transfers of property
at death. Not only was the decedent left in no uncertainty that the gift he was then making was subject to
the provisions of the existing statute, but in view of its
well understood purpose he should be regarded as taking
his chances of any increase in the tax burden which might
result from carrying out the established policy of taxation under which substitutes for testamentary gifts were
classed and taxed with them.
The reasonableness of the present application of the
increased rate of tax of the 1918 Act must be determined
in the light of the legislative policy which the 1916 Act
had established before the gift was made. Obviously that

policy would be set at naught if gifts made in contemplation of death, after the 1916 Act, were to be taxed more
favorably than transfers from the donor occurring at and
by reason of his death. As was apparent when the 1916
Act was adopted, that policy could be made effective only
if gifts made in contemplation of death, while that Act
was in force, were to be subject at the donor's death to
such rate as might at the time of that event be applicable
to the transfer of the donor's estate. The decedent, when
he made his gift, was as well warned that it might be
taxed on that basis as he was that it would be so taxed
if on that day he had made the same disposition of it by
will. A change in the rate applicable to transfers at death
necessitates a corresponding change in the rate applicable
to gifts made in contemplation of death, else the purpose
in taxing the latter would not be attained. That purpose,
as already indicated, was to put such gifts on the same
plane as testamentary disposals.
Only a word need be said of the suggestion that the
application of § 402 (c) to gifts made while the 1916 Act
was in force destroys the character of the tax as one on
privileges, and so renders it invalid as an unapportioned
direct tax forbidden by §§ 2 and 9 of Article I of the Constitution. See Levy v. Wardell, 258 U. S. 542, 545. The
present gift was subject to the excise when made; and for
reasons already indicated, we think a mere increase in the
tax, pursuant to a policy of which the donor was forewarned at the time he elected to exercise the privilege, did
not change its character. See Hecht v. Malley, supra, p.
164. Further, as an appropriate and indeed necessary
measure to secure the effective administration of a system
of death taxes, we think the present tax is to be supported
as an incident and in aid of the exercise of the constitutional power to levy a tax on the transfer of the decedent's
estate at death. See Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226
