BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. HOUSTON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 199. Argued March 12, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.
1. In the reorganization of a trust company in receivership, it was
agreed that directors of the company who subscribed to a fund for
administering and liquidating certain collateral should have an interest in what might be realized in excess of a value guaranteed
to the company. Held, that such an interest is "property." P. 226.
2. Under §§214 (a) (5) and 202 (a) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1918,
where a property interest acquired before March 1, 1913, in a transaction .entered into for profit is sold in the taxable year at a loss,
the loss deductible is limited by the value of the property on March
1, 1913, if that is less than original cost. P. 227.
3. A taxpayer claiming such deduction must prove, by the best available evidence that the circumstances and nature of the transaction
permit, the value of the property as of March 1, 1913, as well as
its cost. Id.
4. If proof of value as of March 1, 1913, be impossible, the claim of
a deduction can not be allowed upon a consideration of the other
factors of the statute. P.228.
5. It may not be presumed that cost of property acquired in 1906 was
its value in 1913, where non contat that the cost was the value
even at the time of acquisition. Id.
39 F. (2d) 351, reversed.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. William Clarke Mason, with whom Mr. John Russell, Jr., was on the brief, for respondent.
Messrs. James Craig Peacock and Gerald Ronon, by
special leave of Court, filed a brief as amici curiae.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The question in this case arises under § 214 (a) of the
Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1066, 1067, the
pertinent part of which is as follows:
"Sec. 214 (a). That in computing net income there
shall be allowed as deductions:
"(5) Losses sustained during the taxable year and not
compensated for by insurance or otherwise, if incurred in
any transaction entered into for profit, . .
The respondent, in making his tax return for 1920,
claimed a loss incurred in a transaction entered into in
the year 1906, by which he acquired certain rights of the
character, and in the manner, hereafter stated. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the claim, and
his determination was sustained by the Board of Tax
Appeals upon the ground that the taxpayer had failed to
show the value of the rights as of March 1, 1913. 13
B. T. A. 279. Upon a petition for review the Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the claim and reversed the action
of the Board of Tax Appeals. 39 F. (2d) 351.
The following are the facts: In 1906, owing to excessive
loans made to Adolph Segal, the Real Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia closed its doors, and a receiver was
appointed. Segal had deposited collateral, which possessed an "uncertain value" and could not readily be
liquidated. A plan of reorganization was proposed by the
receiver, which, among other things, contemplated the
creation of a fund of $2,500,000 to be subscribed by diree-

Opinion of the Court.

tors of the company to guarantee a value of $3,000,000 for
the Segal collateral--designated in the plan, "Segal matters." The subscribers to the fund were to receive any
excess over the amount of $3,000,000 which might be realized from the administration of the "Segal matters." No
limit of time was put upon the administration, or upon
the final disposition, of the assets embraced by the "Segal
matters." The plan became effective and the company
resumed business on November 1, 1906; and thereafter,
and until December 30, 1920, the "Segal matters" were
administered under the exclusive direction of the president
of the company, who theretofore had been the receiver.
The respondent, a director of the company, was a subscriber to the fund in the sum of $305,000. At the time
of the subscription respondent believed that the "Segal
matters" had a potential value which could be converted
into a sum sufficient to repay the subscribers the amount
of their subscriptions with interest, and possibly some
profit. The president, then receiver, expressed to the
directors the same belief.
Included in the Segal collateral were certain bonds and
shares of stock of the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company. At the time the subscriptions to the guarantee
fund were made, there was in contemplation the bringing
of a suit in behalf of that company against the American
Sugar Refining Company under the Sherman Antitrust
Act; and the value of the "Segal matters" depended to
some extent upon the successful prosecution of this suit.
In fact, two suits were brought, one in a federal district
court for $10,000,000, and another in a state court, the
latter on the ground that an agent of the American Sugar
Refining Company had made an agreement in restraint
of trade with Segal. The litigation was compromised in
January, 1910, upon the delivery to the Real Estate Trust
Company by the American Sugar Refining Company of
certain bonds, among which were bonds of the Pennsyl80705°-31-15

vania Sugar Refining Company. In 1912, the latter were
converted into 7,268 shares of stock in a reorganization
called Pennsylvania Sugar Company. Some question
having arisen in respect of the rights of the subscribers,
on May 5, 1916, a supplemental agreement was made to
the effect that when the 7,268 shares of stock in the Pennsylvania Sugar Company were disposed of, the contributors to the guarantee fund should receive one-fourth of
the proceeds. These shares, at that time and for a period
prior thereto, constituted the principal unliquidated assets
of the original "Segal matters."
In 1920, the parties concerned having concluded that
the remaining Segal assets would not soon increase in
value, the subscribers entered into agreements providing
for complete liquidation of the "Segal matters," and,
thereupon, for the distribution of one-fourth of the Pennsylvania Sugar Company stock to the subscribers in proportion respectively to the amounts of their subscriptions,
in full satisfaction of all agreements relating thereto.
Respondent, accordingly, received 222 shares of Pennsylvania Sugar Company stock, the fair market value of
which was $150 per share. Upon that basis, respondent,
in 1920, wrote off his books a loss of $271,700, a sum arrived at by deducting $33,300, the value of the stock
received, froim $305,000, the amount of his original subscription. In his return for 1920 the amount was deducted as a loss.
We assume, for the purposes of the case, that, within
the meaning of § 214 (a) (5), the facts establish a transaction entered into for profit by the subscribers to the
fund of $2,500,000. In this view each subscriber acquired
an interest in the amount which might be realized in excess
of $3,000,000 by the administration and disposition of the
"Segal matters." Such an interest falls within the meaning of the term "property." See Toumsend v. Ashepoo

Opinion of the Court.

Fertilizer Co., 212 Fed. 97, 101; Samet v. Farmer's& Merchants' Nat. Bank, 247 Fed. 669, 671; Presbrey v. Simpson, 290 Fed. 333, 335. Tested alone by the faut that the
cost to respondent in 1906 of his portion of this interest
was $305,000, and the fact that by the final settlement of
1920 he received only the sum of $33,300, the result was an
actual loss to the extent of the sum claimed. But this is
not enough. Section 202 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918,
supra, provides:
"That for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived
or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of
property, real, personal, or mixed, the basis shall be"(1) In the case of property acquired before March 1,
1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of
that date; . . ."
Under this provision, it is necessary to consider not only
the cost of the interest acquired by respondent in 1906
but also its fair market price or value as of March 1, 1913;
and whichever of these is found to be the lower must be
taken as the basis for determining the loss resulting from
the final disposition of the property. In other words, the
effect of the provision in respect of value on March 1,
1913, is to limit the deductible loss by that value if it be
less than the original cost. This is the effect of the prior
decisions of this court. United States v. Flannery, 268
U. S. 98, 103, and cases cited; Heiner v. Tindle, 276 U. S.
582, 587. And see Nichols v. Smith, 35 F. (2d) 938, 939;
Bloch v. Commissioner, 16 B. T. A. 425, affirmed, 42 F.
(2d) 1013.
The burden of proof to establish a deductible loss and
the amount of it, clearly, was upon the respondent.
Reinecke v. Spalding, 280 U. S. 227, 233; United States
v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 443. It was just as necessary
under the statute for the respondent to prove value as of
March 1, 1913, as it was to prove cost in 1906 and the

amount finally received by him in 1920. The court below,
after a review of the facts, disposed of the matter by
saying:
"To determine, in view of these variable factors, or lack
of factors, its true or approximate value on a given date,
as that of March 1, 1913, selected by the commissioner as
the basis of the tax calculation, was a sheer impossibility.
The only fixed factors in the situation were those of cost
in 1906 and return in 1920. It follows that the proper
basis for measuring the petitioner's admitted loss-because
the only possible basis-was that of cost and return."
We cannot agree that the impossibility of establishing
a specific fact, made essential by the statute as a prerequisite to the allowance of a loss, justifies a decision for
the taxpayer based upon a consideration only of the remaining factors which the statute contemplates. The
definite requirement of § 202 (a) (1) of the act is not
thus easily to be put aside. The impossibility of proving
a material fact upon which the right to relief depends,
simply leaves the claimant upon whom the burden rests
with an unenforcible claim, a misfortune to be borne by
him, as it must be borne in other cases, as the result of a
failure of proof. Compare Underwood v. Wing, 4 De Gex,
M. & G. 632, 660; Newel v. Nichols, 75 N. Y. 78, 90;
Estate of Ehle, 73 Wis. 445, 459-460; 41 N. W. 627; 2
Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence, § 970.
Neither can the presumption be indulged that the cost
of respondent's interest in 1906 was the value of that
interest in 1913, for non constat that such cost was the
value even in 1906.
Moreover, we think the record is far from demonstrating
the impossibility of supplying evidence from which the
required fact might be found. The 7,268 shares of stock
in the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, the distribution of
which in 1920 closed the transaction, had been received by
the Real Estate Trust Company as early as 1912. This

stock, together with certain bonds, not otherwise described, constituted on March 1, 1913, the entire available
assets remaining of the original "Segal matters." There
seems to have been no difficulty in ascertaining the value
of the stock in 1920; and it is hard to see why its value,
as well as the value of the bonds, could not have been, at
least approximately, determined as of March 1, 1913, and,
consequently, the approximate value of the contingent interest of each of the subscribers to the fund ascertained as
of that date. No reason is suggested by the record or
otherwise, and none occurs to us, for not seeking light on
the subject from those who had been in charge of the
liquidation of the "Segal matters." We cannot assume
that such an effort would have been fruitless. Respondent was bound to produce the best available evidence of value which the circumstances and nature of the
transaction permitted. It does not appear that he made
any attempt to do so.
