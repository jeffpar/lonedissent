filed in court. Here there was no compliance with the
statute nor was there a waiver of its condition, since the
Commissioner had no knowledge of the claim and took no
action with respect to it.
The necessity for filing a claim such as the statute requires is not dispensed with because the claim may be
rejected. It is the rejection which makes the suit necessary. An anticipated rejection of the claim, which the
statute contemplates, is not a ground for suspending its
operation. Even though formal, the condition upon
which the consent to suit is given is defined by the words
of the statute, and "they mark the conditions of the claimant's right." Rock Island R. R.v. United States, 254 U. S.
141, 143. Compliance may be dispensed with by waiver,
as an administrative act, Tucker v. Alexander, supra; but
it is not within the judicial province to read out of the
statute the requirement of its words. Rand v. United
States, 249 U. S. 503, 510.

CERTIORARI, 282 U. S. 822,

283 U.S.

to review judgments expung-

ing claims in bankruptcy based on endorsements of
promissory notes, some of which were payable within the
year after adjudication and others at later dates. The
District Court had sustained the claims.
Messrs. Randolph Bias and Wells Goodykoontz for petitioners.
Mr. Stanley Reed for respondent.
MR. JusncE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The bankrupts in these cases were endorsers of promissory notes payable to petitioners, some of them within the
year after adjudication, allowed by § 57 (n) of the Bankruptcy Act (July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 561) for
proof of claims, others at later dates. Petitioners filed
proofs of claim upon the endorsements, which were allowed. Proceedings were brought by the trustee to
expunge the claims as not provable.
Upon review, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit held that as none of the notes was due at the time
of the petition, and as neither presentment nor notice of
dishonor had been waived, the liability with respect to
each of the endorsements was not a provable claim, because contingent, and gave judgment accordingly, 40 F.
(2d) 17, following its earlier decision in First National
Bank v. Elliott, 19 F. (2d) 426. This Court granted certiorari, 282 U. S. 822, to resolve the conflict between the
decision below and those of other circuit courts of appeals,
in Moch v. Market Street National Bank, 107 Fed. 897
(C. C. A. 3rd), and in In re Semmer Glass Co., 135 Fed. 77
(C. C. A. 2d), appeal dismissed, 203 U. S. 141; see Colman
Co. v. Withoft, 195 Fed. 250, 253.
Section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act provides:
"(a) Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed
against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evi-

denced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition
against him, whether then payable or not, with. any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that
date or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not
then payable and did not bear interest; . . . (4) founded

upon an open account, or upon a contract express or
implied; . . .

"(b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may,
pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such
manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved
and allowed against his estate."
Section 17 provides that "A discharge in bankruptcy
shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable
debts

. .

." with exceptions not now material, and

§ 1 (11) that "' debt' shall include any debt, demand, or
claim provable in bankruptcy." Earlier acts provided for
the proof of various types of contingent liability specifically enumerated, including that of the endorser of negotiable paper, § 5, Act of August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440,
445; § 19, Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517, 525.
Although the omission of any reference to contingent
claims in § 63 of the present Act has led to some confusion
and uncertainty in the decisions, it is now settled that
claims founded upon contract, which at the time of the
bankruptcy are fixed in amount or susceptible of liquidation, may be proved under subdivision (a) (4) of that
section, although not absolutely owing when the petition
is filed. Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., 236 U. S.549;
Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, 240 U. S. 581.
The sole question now presented is whether the liability
of an endorser is of that class.
The obligation of an endorser is at least a "claim," and
hence a debt so far as defined by § 1 (11) ; and the language
of § 63, which permits proof of a claim "founded

.

.

upon a contract, express or implied," is broad enough to

embrace the liability of an endorser upon negotiable paper
which has not matured at the time of the adjudication.
Within three years after the enactment of the Bankruptcy
Act, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Moch v.
Market Street National Bank, supra,held that the liability
of a bankrupt endol'ser of commercial paper, which did
not mature until after the filing of the petition, was a
provable claim under § 63 (a) (4). This ruling was followed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
In re Semmer Glass Co., supra, and appears to have been
accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
Colman Co. v. Withoft, supra, p. 253, and by the district
courts generally. In re O'Donnell, 131 Fed. 150; In re
Rothenberg, 140 Fed. 798; In re Smith, 146 Fed. 923; In
re Dunlap Carpet Co., 163 Fed. 541; In re Caloris Mfg.
Co., 179 Fed. 722; In re Buzzini, 183 Fed. 827; In re
Refining Co., 192 Fed. 445; In re Keith-GaraCo., 203 Fed.
585; Heyman v. Third National Bank, 216 Fed. 685; In
re Amdur Shoe Co., 13 F. (2d) 147. See also Germania
Savings Bank v. Loeb, 188 Fed. 285, 289; Courtney v.
Trust Co., 219 Fed. 57, 66 (both C. C. A. 6th).
The rule thus announced seems not to have been seriously challenged until the decision, twenty-six years later,
of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in First
National Bank v. Elliott, supra. In Dunbar v. Dunbar,
190 U. S. 340, the Moch case was cited and distinguished
from the claim involved in that case, which was dependent
upon a contingency so uncertain, as the court held, that
its liquidation or valuation was impossible. In the meantime, leading text writers have stated that the liability of
an endorser, upon a note falling due after the petition, is
provable under § 63 (a) (4). 1 Loveland on Bankruptcy
(4th ed.) p. 609; 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (13th ed.) pp.

Opinion of the Court.

Only compelling language in the statute itself would
warrant the rejection of a construction so long and so generally accepted, especially where overturning the established practice would have such far reaching consequences
as in the present instance. But such language is wanting in § 63. That section purports to be an enumeration
of classes of provable claims-not an enumeration of
characteristics which must inhere in every claim proved.
Only by reading into subdivision (a) (4) the limitation
of subdivision (a) (1) that the claim must be absolutely
owing, would there be ground for rejecting a claim against
a bankrupt endorser as not complying with the former.
Respondent argues that (a) (4) must be so read, since,
otherwise, the limitation in (a) (1) would be practically
without effect. See In re Roth & Appel, 181 Fed. 667;
In re Hutchcraft,247 Fed. 187. But this contention was
rejected by the decision in Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co.,
supra; see Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium,
supra, pp. 592, 593, and is not supported, as respondent
contends, by Zavelo v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625. That case
held only that § 63, read in the light of the spirit and
purpose of the Act, did not authorize proof of claim upon
an obligation entered into by the bankrupt after the filing
of the petition. See In re Burka, 104 Fed. 326.
Possible doubts as to the meaning of the section should
be resolved in the light of the purpose of the Act "to convert the assets of the bankrupt into cash for distribution
among creditors and then to relieve the honest debtor
from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permit
him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes." Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., supra, p. 554; Central Trust
Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, supra, p. 591. If this purpose
be given its appropriate weight, a meaning cannot be
attributed to the plain words of subdivision (a) (4), which
would so restrict them as to preclude proof of claim upon

the liability of an endorser of commercial paper, and result in its survival of the bankrupt's discharge as an obligation enforcible against him.
That some contingent claims are deemed not provable
does not militate against this conclusion. The contingency of the bankrupt's obligation may be such as to render any claim upon it incapable of proof. It may be one
beyond the control of the creditor, and dependent upon
an event so fortuitous as to make it uncertain whether
liability will ever attach. In re Merrill & Baker, 186 Fed.
312. Such a claim could not be proved under the Act of
1841 although in terms permitting proof of contingent
claims. Riggin v. Magwire, 15 Wall. 549. Or, the contingency may be such as to make any valuation of the
claim impossible, even though liability has attached. Of
this latter class was the claim upon the bankrupt's contract to pay his divorced wife a specified amount annually
so long as she should remain unmarried, proof of which
was for that reason rejected in Dunbar v. Dunbar,supra;
see Atkins v. Wilcox, 105 Fed. 595.
But the liability of an endorser is of neither class. Its
amount is certain; and the contingency of notice of dishonor to the endorser is within the control of the creditor,
so as to place his claim, so far as its certainty of accrual
and its susceptibility of liquidation are concerned, upon
the same footing as the contract of indemnity which was
held provable in Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., supra,
although the claimant had done nothing at the time of the
bankruptcy to satisfy the liability for which the indemnity
was given. See also Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, supra, pp. 593, 594.
The claim against the endorser of paper not matured at
the time of the bankruptcy thus stands on the same plane
as contracts of suretyship or guarantee of payment of a
debt not due until after the bankruptcy. See In re Refining Co., supra; Collier on Bankruptcy, supra; Reming-

ton on Bankruptcy, supra. Even though not due until
after the year allowed for proof of claims, if proved in
time, such a claim may be liquidated as are other unmatured claims. In re Buzzini, supra, p. 830. As the
claim is provable, and as notice of dishonor after the petition is filed is necessary only to charge the endorser, in the
event he does not secure his discharge, the claimant need
not give notice of dishonor in order to share in the estate.
See Coleman Co. v. Withoft, supra, p. 253.
The application of respondent to expunge the claims
should be denied in each case. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in
accordance with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 425.

Argued February 26, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

Leases by the State of Texas to a private corporation granted, for
a term of years with privilege of renewal, the right to enter on
designated lands of the state public domain for the purpose of
drilling and operating for oil and gas and to erect and maintain
all necessary structures for the production, transportation and
storage of those products. They required the lessee or owner of
the rights conveyed to pay the State the value of one-eighth of
the oil produced and of one-tenth of the gas sold. As construed
by the State Supreme Court, such leases effect present sales to
the lessee of the oil and gas in place. Held, that the profits
derived by the lessee from the sale of oil and gas produced, after
deducting the State's royalties, are not immune from federal taxation upon the ground that the leases are state instrumentalities.
