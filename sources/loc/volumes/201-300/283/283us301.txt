BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. THOMPSON OIL & GAS COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO "THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 288. Argued March 16, 17, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.
Section 234 (a) (9) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that in
computing the net income of a corporation from oil-mining properties, there shall be deducted a reasonable allowance for depletion
based upon cost, and that in case of such properties acquired
before March 1, 1913, the fair market value of the property on that
date shall be taken in lieu of costs up to that date.
Held that in determining for the taxable year the capital value
recoverable through depletion allowance, there should be deducted
from the March 1, 1913, value of the property the amount of
depletion actually sustained in intervening years, even though the
deductions allowed for depletion in those years, under the Acts
then in force, were less than the actual depletion. P. 304.

the taxpayer's petition the Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner.1 An appeal was taken to the
Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the
Board, 40 F. (2d) 493. This court grafted certiorari,
282 U. S. 823.
The question presented is whether under ยง 234 (a) (9)
of the Revenue Act of 1918,2 in determining for any taxable year the capital value, recoverable through depletion
allowance, of oil mining properties acquired prior to
March 1, 1913, there should be deducted from the March
1, 1913 value of the properties the amount of depletion
actually sustained in earlier years, or only so much of
such depletion as was allowable as deductions under the
revenue acts in force in those years.
The Board of Tax Appeals found the following facts:
The taxpayer owned an oil and gas mining lease acquired
prior to March 1, 1913. On that date the recoverable oil
in the reserve embraced by the lease was 278,000 barrels,
and its value was $156,645, or $0.56347 per barrel. Between March 1, 1913 and December 31, 1915, it extracted
162,717 barrels of oil, so that at the unit rate mentioned
it sustained depletion amounting to $91,686.15. Its deduction for depletion in computing net income under the
115 B. T. A. 993.

2 40 Stat. 1077.

Sec. 234. (a) That in computing the net income
of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 there
shall be allowed as deductions: . . . (9) In the case of mines, oil
and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according
to the peculiar conditions in each case, based upon cost including cost
of development not otherwise deducted: Provided, That in the case
of such properties acquired prior to March 1, 1913, the fair market
value of the property (or the taxpayer's interest therein) on that
date shall be taken in lieu of costs up to that date: . . . such
reasonable allowance in all the above cases to be made under rules
and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner with the
approval of the Secretary. ...

BURNET v. THOMPSON OIL & G. CO.
301

Opinion of the Court.

Revenue Act of 1913 ' was computed not by reference to
the number of barrels extracted, or to the value of the
reserve on March 1, 1913, but by taking five per cent. of
the gross income from the sale of oil. The depletion allowance for 1913 to 1915, inclusive, computed by this method,
amounted to $6322.02.
In 1916 the taxpayer secured an extension of its lease
at a cost of $30,000, whereby its oil reserve was increased
by 300,000 barrels. There then remained of the original
reserve 115,283 barrels having a value as of March 1, 1913,
of $64,958.85. The Commissioner added to this depleted
value the cost of the extension of the lease, and added to
the remaining oil reserves of the original lease the additional 300,000 barrels then acquired. He thus ascertained
a new total recoverable reserve of 415,283 barrels having
a basic value or cost of $94,958.85, or $0.22866 per barrel.
There were no subsequent additions to the reserves.
In 1916 there were produced under the lease 49,452 barrels of oil, and in 1917, 39,204 barrels, leaving the reserve
at January 1, 1918, 326,627 barrels.
A new method of allowance for depletion was adopted
in the Revenue Act of 1916.' Depletion was sustained
under the formula therein prescribed in those two years,
8 c. 16, ยง II. B.; 38 Stat. 167. That in computing net income
. . . there shall be allowed as deductions: . . . sixth, a reasonable
allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out
of its use or employment in the business, not to exceed, in the case
of mines, 5 per centum of the gross value at the mine of the output
for the year for which the computation is made, . . .
' c. 463, 39 Stat. 767-768. Sec. 12 (a). In the case of a corporation . . . such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from

sustained and charged off within the year and not compensated by

production or regular flow; . . .

amounting to $20,272.08. It is agreed that this figure is
correct and represents the sustained depletion as well as
allowed depletion for those years.
During 1918 there were produced 33,697 barrels of oil.
At the unit price adopted by the Commissioner of $0.22866
per barrel, the depletion sustained and allowed for that
year was $7705.16. It is this depletion allowance for the
year 1918 which is here called in question.
In view of the fact that the depletion actually sustained
by the taxpayer between March 1, 1913 and December 31,
1915, was $91,686.15, whereas in conformity with the act
of 1913 the deduction actually allowed it as for depletion
was only $6322.02, the respondent contended that the unit
rate of depletion per barrel for 1918 should have been
based upon the original March 1, 1913 value of the reserves, plus the cost of the extension of the lease, and less
only that portion of the actually sustained depletion which
was in fact allowed pursuant to the terms of the 1913 act.
The Commissioner, on the other hand, subtracted from
the March 1, 1913, value plus the cost of the extension
of the lease, the sustained or actual depletion, holding that
the entire depletion actually sustained should be deducted
from the original March 1, 1913 value, regardless of
whether it was allowable as deductions from the gross income of the years 1913, 1914 and 1915. The Circuit
Court of Appeals decided in favor of the respondent.
The parties agree that respondent is not entitled as matter of right to make any deduction from annual income
for depletion of the oil extracted and sold during the year.
If it may take any such deduction, authority therefor must
be found in the statute.' It follows that the question for
decision is purely one of statutory construction.
It is clear that Congress intended that the lessee of an
oil well should be entitled to a reasonable allowance for
5

depletion based upon cost or March 1, 1913 value. It did
not however attempt to prescribe a formula for ascertaining it, but expressly delegated that function to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was to make rules
and regulations to that end. Pursuant to this authority,
regulations were made, which required the deduction of
depletion theretofore sustained in ascertaining the capital
remaining in any year recoverable by depletion deductions.' It is undisputed that the Commissioner calculated
the depletion deduction in this case in accordance with the
regulations.
The taxpayer contends, however, and the court below
held, that the allowance granted was not reasonable-as
the-act required it should be-because although it reflected

the actual depletion in the year 1918, considered by itself,
the result of the application of the regulation will fall
short of returning to the taxpayer its March 1, 1913, capital tax-free at the date of exhaustion of the oil reserve. It
is said that this was the intent of Congress as shown not
only by the terms of the act, but by the history of prior
legislation. Hence it is claimed that only the depletion
allowed under the act of 1913 should be deducted in ascertaining the depletable capital at January 1, 1918. Thus
respondent would recover its entire capital tax-free. The
Government contends that the depletion allowance provided by the regulations is reasonable.
It is evident that the act of 1913 did not allow enough
to return the capital on exhaustion of the reserve. The
deduction permitted by that act fell some $85,000 short of
OArt. 203. Capital recoverable through depletion deductions in the

case of lessee.--(a) In the case of a lessee, the capital remaining in
any year recoverable through depletion and depreciation deductions
is (1) the value as of the basic date of the lessee's equity in the
property plus (2) subsequent allowable capital additions but minus
(3) depletion and depreciation sustained, whether legally allowable or
not, from the basic date to the taxable year. ...

what was required in 1913-1915 for that purpose. Was
it then the intent of the act of 1918 to permit a deduction
from gross income for depletion which would represent not
only that year's sustained depletion, but make up for sustained but disallowed depletion in the earlier years? The
Government says, and we think rightly, that there is
nothing in the terms of the act to indicate any such purpose. The tax is an income tax for 1918, and in the
absence of express provision to the contrary, it is not to
be supposed that the taxpayer is authorized to deduct
from that year's income, depreciation, depletion, business
losses or other similar items attributable to other years.!
The very fact that Congress denied deductions equal to
the sustained depletion in the earlier years negatives an
intent that they should be allowed in later years, as if for
depletion then sustained. The construction adopted by
the court below in effect results in including in the taxable
year items referable to other years, and is contrary to the
theory of a tax for specific years.
The nature of the tax as one for annual periods has been
repeatedly mentioned in dealing with its application in
various situations." The taxable year 1918, and that only,
is involved, and deductions applicable to that year only
should be allowed.
The court below recognized that its decision resulted in
attributing an excessive value to the reserves remaining
in 1918, but thought that United States v. Ludey, 274
U. S. 295, required it so to hold. That case, however,
involved the determination of taxable gain or loss on the

sale of an oil property. To ascertain gain on a sale of a
capital asset, there must be subtracted from the sale price
a sum sufficient to restore the value at the date of acquisition (or March 1, 1913).' The remainder is income. So
in the Ludey case it was held that, in order to ascertain
the depleted cost, only the allowed depletion should be
deducted from the original cost. Allowed depletion
rather than sustained depletion was there the true measure of deduction. But here the question is what allowance Congress intended should be made from the gross
annual income of the operation of an oil well. In the one
case the question is how much of the capital has already
been returned tax-free; in the other how much of the
oil reserve remains at the beginning of a taxable year to
be depleted over the period remaining until exhaustion.
The court below relied on certain statements in the opinion in the Ludey case which were applicable in the
determination of gain on a sale, but which do not apply
in this case, for if the sale of each barrel of oil were a partial sale of the reserve (which it is not) to apply the rule
which respondent seeks to deduce from the Ludey case
would increase the cost or 1913 value of each barrel sold,
in determining gain or loss in 1918, beyond its actual cost
or 1913 value, taken for barrels sold in prior years. The
decision in the Ludey case has been adopted in the later
statutes as affecting sales of capital assets," but the provision for annual depletion allowance has remained substantially unchanged." This in itself is persuasive evi9 Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179.

dence that Congress has approved the executive construction embodied in the regulations.12
Respondent insists that the increasing liberality in the
statutory provisions for depletion allowances in the successive Revenue Acts, indicates that Congress never intended that the 1918 act should be so construed or administered as to deprive the taxpayer of the return of his
entire capital tax-free. But the increasing liberality was
to be applicable in calculating net income for the successive years and we can find no evidence either in the acts or
in the regulations, of any intent to increase future depletion allowances to redress the inadequacy of those previously permitted.
It follows that the judgment must be
