prescribing of the number of employees or the compensation to be paid them. We think it very clear that Congress has not prescribed or empowered the Commission to
fix the number of men to be employed in train or switching
crews.
No analysis or discussion of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 is necessary to show that it does
not conflict with the Arkansas statutes under consideration.

BONWIT TELLER & COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 282.

Argued March 16, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. Section 281 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924, as amended March 3,
1925, provides that if a taxpayer has, on or before June 15, 1925,
filed a waiver of his right to have the tax due for the taxable year
1919 determined and assessed within five years after the return
was filed, then refund relating to such tax shall be made if claim
therefor is filed on or before April 1926. Held that it should be
construed liberally in favor of a taxpayer as to what amounts to
a claim for refund. P. 263.
2. Prior to the above amendment, the Commissioner had finally, upon
full information and consideration, determined that the taxpayer
had overpaid its tax in a stated amount, and he had then withheld a refund solely because the taxpayer had not complied with
ยง 281 as it then stood. Soon after the amendment, the Commissioner notified the taxpayer that the overassessment could not
be allowed unless the taxpayer filed a waiver on or before June 15,
1925, as the amendment required, and he enclosed blanks for that
purpose. The taxpayer executed and returned the waiver before
that date, with a letter to the Commissioner saying that the
waiver was sent to him in accordance with his request. Held that
the Commissioner was warranted in accepting the waiver and the
letter transmitting it, with what went before, as amounting to the
filing of a claim within the meaning of the amendment. P. 263.

3. A suit based upon a determination and certification by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that the plaintiff is entitled to a

CERTIORARI, 282 U. S. 823, to review a judgment dismissing a claim to recover an overpayment of income tax.
Mr. Arthur B. Hyman for petitioner.
Assistant Attorney General Rugg, with whom Solicitor
General Thacher and Messrs. Claude R. Branch, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, George H. Foster,
Bradley B. Gilman, and Erwin N. Griswold were on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This action was brought to recover the amount of an
overpayment of income tax for the year ended January 31,
1919, as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and shown in his certificate, No. 990,988, issued to
plaintiff May 12, 1927. The Government first filed a
general traverse. But later, asserting lack of authority
on the part of the Commissioner to make the determination and refund, it filed a counterclaim for the amount of
a check sent plaintiff to pay the balance of the refund
remaining after deducting a part to pay an additional tax
assessed against it for the year ended January 31, 1917.
That tax was then, as it is now conceded, barred by a
statute of limitation. Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Co., 273 U. S. 346. On special findings the court
entered judgment dismissing plaintiff's complaint and the
Government's counterclaim but gave the latter judgment
for the cost of printing the record. 69 Ct. Cls. 638; 39 F.
(2d) 730. On plaintiff's petition we granted a writ of
certiorari. 282 U. S. 823.
The court found:

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

Plaintiff is a corporation engaged in the business of
selling merchandise at retail. Its fiscal year begins February 1. July 14, 1919, it filed its return for the year
ended January 31, 1919, reporting an income tax of $57,871.16 which was paid, one-half July 14 and the balance
December 13 following. Pending audit of the return, the
Commissioner fixed plaintiff's total tax liability for that
year at $225,165.75 and in April, 1924, made a jeopardy
assessment for $167,294.59, the excess over the amount returned and paid. The plaintiff promptly filed a claim for
abatement of the full amount of the additional assessment.
November 19, 1924, the bureau sent plaintiff a letter
containing a schedule disclosing the computation of its
tax for the year ended January 31, 1919, and showing a
total overassessment of $178,161.02. From this amount
there was deducted $10,866.43 found by the Commissioner
to have been erroneously included in plaintiff's return and
paid. The letter stated: "Inasmuch as the provisions of
section 281 of the revenue act of 19241 have not been
complied with [in] regard to the full amount of the above
' Section 281, 43 Stat. 301:
"(b) Except as provided in subdivision ...

(e)

. .

. no such

credit or refund shall be allowed or made after four years from the
time the tax was paid, unless before the expiration of such four years
a claim therefor is filed by the taxpayer....
"(e) If the taxpayer has, within five years from the time the
return for the taxable year 1917 was due, filed a waiver of his right to
have the taxes due for* such taxable year determined and assessed
within five years after the return was filed, or if he has, on or before
June 15, 1924, filed such a waiver in respect of the taxes due for the
taxable year 1918, then such credit or refund relating to the taxes
for the year in respect of which the waiver was filed shall be allowed
or made if claim therefor is filed either on or before April 1, 1925,
or within four years from the time the tax was paid.
"(f) This section shall not . . . (2) bar from allowance a claim in

respect of a tax for the taxable year 1919 or 1920, if such claim is
filed before the expiration of five years after the date the return
was due."

Opinion of the Court.

overassessment, a portion in the amount of $10,866.43
cannot be allowed." In accordance with that letter, the
Commissioner allowed plaintiff's claim for abatement.
May 16, 1925, the bureau wrote plaintiff that an examination of its income tax return for the year ended
January 31, 1919, disclosed an apparent overassessment,
and that it could not then be allowed" unless an income
and profits tax waiver is filed on or before June 15, 1925,
as provided by an Act of Congress dated March 3, 1925,
amending ยง 281 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924. Two
waiver forms are therefore enclosed in order that you may,
if you desire, execute and forward one of the forms to
this office." Plaintiff executed the waiver and May 22,
1925, returned it with a letter stating: "In accordance
with your request, we enclose you herewith waiver." On
the following day the waiver was received and accepted
in writing by the Commissioner.
December 11, 1926, counsel for plaintiff sent the bureau
a letter which quoted the substance, as above given, of the
letters of November 19, 1924, and May 16, 1925, and, in
reference to the letter of May 22, 1925, said: "Since that
time we have heard nothing further from you and there
has been no refund made to the taxpayer." February 5,
1927, the head of the audit division approved and recommended for allowance the certificate of overassessment No.
990,988. The record of the case was checked to determine
whether the plaintiff had filed a claim for refund prior
to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation.
And it was determined that the documents filed, which included the audit letter of November 19, 1924, showing
how the amount of the overpayment was ascertained, the
2

Act of March 3, 1925, 43 Stat. 1115, added to ยง 281 (e):
"If the taxpayer has, on or before June 15, 1925, filed such a waiver
-in respect of the taxes due for the taxable year 1919, then such credit
or refund relating to the taxes for the taxable year 1919 shall be
allowed or made if claim therefor is filed either on or before April 1,
1926, or within four years from the time the tax was paid."

letter of May 16, 1925, furnishing form of waiver, and
the plaintiff's answer of May 22 following, enclosing the
executed waiver, would be treated by the bureau as an
informal claim for refund filed May 23, 1925.
Plaintiff's letter of May 22, 1925, bears an undated
endorsement: "Inferential demand for the refund upon
basis of the schedule sent taxpayer under date of November 19, 1924 . . .Rules and Regulations. Mulligan,"
and another ,dated April 4, 1927: "Approved by Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Sherwood for scheduling as is. 0. Allen."
February 9, 1927, the bureau wrote plaintiff's counsel:
. . in order that the allowance of the overassessment
may be made, you are requested to file with this office a
claim on the enclosed Form 843 setting forth the basis of
the adjustment . . ." Accordingly, plaintiff executed the
form and thereon stated that the application should be
allowed for the reasons shown in the audit letter of November 19, 1924, a copy of which was attached. And
February 17, 1927, plaintiff returned the form with a letter
saying: ". . . we enclose herewith for filing, claim for
refund in the sum of $10,866.43 . . . on Form 843." The
claim was received and filed in the bureau February 19;
the Commissioner allowed the claim and on March 8
approved and scheduled to the collector the certificate of
overassessment.
On the margin of the bureau's record copy appear the
following certifications: "Waiver filed May 23, 1925. Informal claim for refund fied May 23, 1925, with waiver
perfected by claim Form 843. (Signed) 0. Allen, 3/4/27."
"Claim for refund filed May 23, 1925, waiver filed May
23, 1925." "This C. of 0. [certificate of overassessment]
approved for scheduling as is by W. T. S. (Signed)
0. Allen, 4/4/27."
The collector credited $9,846.06 against the additional
tax assessed for the year ending January 31, 1917. May
12, 1927, the Commissioner caused the certificate, show-

ing the deduction made by the collector, to be delivered to
plaintiff with a check for the balance of the overassessment
and interest, $1,462.99. Plaintiff objected to the application of any part of the refund against such additional
assessment on the ground that the 1917 tax was barred,
and declined to accept the check in full settlement but
offered to apply it in partial payment of the claim.
The Government, in support of the judgment below, insists that no claim for refund was filed by plaintiff prior to
April 1, 1926, the time permitted by the Act of March 3,
1925, 43 Stat. 1115, and that therefore the Commissioner
was without authority to allow the claim.
The provision involved amends ยง 281 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 302. It provides that if the
taxpayer has on or before June 15, 1925, filed a waiver of
his right to have the tax due for the taxable year 1919
determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, then refund relating to such tax shall be
made if claim therefor is filed on or before April 1, 1926.
The section is a part of a tax law giving to taxpayers
opportunity to secure refund of overpayments that had
become barred. Manifestly it is to be construed liberally
in favor of the taxpayers to give the relief it was intended
to provide. United States v. Merriam,263 U. S. 179, 187.
Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Co., supra, 350.
UnitedStates v. Updike, 281 U.S. 489,496. United States
v. Michel, 282 U. S. 656.
Plaintiff filed its waiver within time and, in consideration of that, it admittedly secured the right to claim the
refund. But it did not within the specified time formally
make a claim for it. The Government's point comes down
to the question whether the waiver and the letter transmitting it together with what went before amounted to
the filing of a claim within the meaning of the statute.
The Commissioner, prior to that amendment, had finally
determined that in 1919 plaintiff had overpaid its tax by

$10,866.43. That finding was made upon a consideration
of the plaintiff's tax return, its claim for abatement of the
jeopardy assessment and, presumably, all material details
of its business in the taxable year. The schedule contained in the audit letter of November 19, 1924, showed
the manner in which the bureau had computed the tax.
And the refund of the ascertained overpayment was withheld by the Commissioner solely because of plaintiff's lack
of compliance with ยง 281 as it then stood.
The letter of May 16, 1925, sent soon after ยง 281 was
amended, unmistakably referred to the overpayment that
the Commissioner had found and reported. That an
allowance of credit or refund was immediately intended
is shown by the statement that it could not then be
allowed unless waiver was filed as provided by the 1925
amendment. Plaintiff's prompt execution and return of
the waiver and the bureau's acceptance of it clearly show
that both considered the facts already found and reported
a sufficient basis for plaintiff's claim. That such was the
view of the Commissioner is fully confirmed by the notations made on the letter transmitting the waiver and upon
the office record of the certificate.
The question here is to be distinguished from that which
would have arisen if, contrary to the taxpayer's insistence,
the Commissioner had held that what was done did not
constitute a filing of a claim. No statute provides for review of the Commissioner's determinations in favor of taxpayers when made within the scope of his authority.
Such rulings are entitled to much weight. In this case he
had already found that in 1919 plaintiff had overpaid its
tax in the amount stated. He needed no additional information to enable him to determine whether credit or
refund should then be made. There is no suggestion that
the allowance was induced by or resulted from fraud or
mistake. The facts found disclose that there was a reasonable or substantial compliance with the amendment.

BONWIT TELLER & CO. v. UNITED STATES. 265
258

Opinion of the Court.

The Commissioner, within the time allowed, was advised
of the grounds on which plaintiff's right to refund rested,
and was not misled or deceived by plaintiff's failure to
file formal claim, and was fully warranted in holding that
the waiver and earlier documents were sufficient. Tucker
v. Alexander, 275 U. S. 228, 231.
The Government further contends that, even if the
Commissioner's allowance was authorized, this suit is
barred by R. S., ยง 3226, as amended. 26 U. S. C., ยง 156.3
It provides that no suit for the recovery of any internal
revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously collected
shall be begun after five years from the payment of such
tax. The overpayment made was more than five years
before the complaint was filed. This case is not within the
clause giving two years after disallowance, because here
the claim was allowed. Plaintiff pleads its claim in two
forms. The first is based upon the issue and delivery of
the Commissioner's certificate showing plaintiff entitled
to a refund in the amount specified. The second alleges
an account stated showing that there is due plaintiff the
amount claimed. The action is not for the overpayment
of the tax in 1919 but is grounded upon the determination
evidenced by the certificate issued by the Commissioner
May 12, 1927. Upon delivery of the certificate to plaintiff, there arose the cause of action on which this suit was
brought. United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 570.
United States v. Savings Bank, 104 U. S. 728. Bank of
Greencastle'sCase, 15 Ct. Cls. 25. There is no merit in the
contention that the suit is barred.
Judgment reversed.
B"No suit . . . for the recovery of any internal revenue tax
alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected . . .
shall be begun . . . after the expiration of five years from the date
of the payment of such tax . . . unless such suit . . is begun
within two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim to
which such suit . . . relates. .... "
