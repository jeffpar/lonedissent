PENNSYLV ANIA COAL CO. v. CASSATT.
207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

then the order prior to such action on the part of the court
was clearly interlocutory in the suit. Alexander v. United
States, 201 U. S. 117. If the provision of ยง 724 in respect of
disobedience' of such an order was exclusive, then, of course,
respondents were in no way aggrieved. Doyle v. London Guarantee Co., 204 U. S. 599.
Whether the order to produce was valid, and whether it
warranted judgment by default against the defendant company were matters in whic4 plaintiffs in error had no concern.
There was here no attachment for contempt, no judgment on
default, and no independent and collateral proceeding, the
order disposing of which could be considered as a final decree.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded with a direction to
'dismiss the worit of-error.
