tioned this form, it is extravagant to contend that the enactment would have been. void under the laws of the United
States. Yet that is a test. Seq Missouri v. Dockery, 191'U. S.
165, 171. The bill of rights for the Philippines giving the accused the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him does not fasten forever upon those islands the
inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand or accept a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of occurring to intelligence fired with
a desire to pervert.

Celimin, a policeman, who was trying to arrest him, and by
using vile, abusive and threatening language to the same
officer, contrary to Article 249, clause 2, of the Penal Code of
the Philippines. He was sentenced under Article 250, which
provides the punishment for such attempts. He was convicted in the court of first instance of the same facts, but was
sentenced under Article 252, which punishes those, who, without being included in Article 249, should resist the authorities
or their agents. He then appealed, whereupon the Supreme
Court decided that the offense fell within Article 249, and increased the sentence. The errors assigned are that the Supreme.
Court had no jurisdiction to increase the sentence, this being
stated in various forms, and that "The decision of the court
places the accused in jeopardy for the same offense according
to the. corresponding provisibns of Section 5 of the Act of
Congress of July 1, 1902." There is also the usual averment
that the decision deprives the accused of his liberty without
due process of law, but that may be passed over, as there is
nothing in the record to justify it. It is not necessary to consider what wquld amount to denial of due process of law. The
plaintiff in error was convicted after a full trial, with all the
usual forms, upon a specific and definite complaint and evidence warranting the result.
The objection to the power of the Supreme Court to increase
the sentence is disposed of by the recent decision in Trono v.
United States, 199 U. S.521. The only assignment of error that
needs a word is that which was intended to rely upon a previous
conviction that was pleaded and put in evidence. This was a
conviction by a municipal court of a violation of ordinances
of the city of Manila by disorderly conduct, a breach of the
peace, and the assault upon one Domingo Salvador at the
same time and place as the assault alleged in the complaint
before us. Perhaps it should be added that a second complaint under the ordinances for slanderous, threatening and
abusive language to Captain Jos( Crame of the Manila Police
Department was dismissed by the municipal judge on the

ground that the offense could not be split up. None of the
acts alleged in these complaints was the assault upon Celimin,

relied upon in the present case, and it does not appear that the
assault upon Celimin was relied on or proved as part of the
disorderly conduct for which the plaintiff in error was punished
in the municipal court. It is unnecessary to consider whether
the same conduct could be punished at the same time on the
same grounds by both a superior and subordinate authority
in the same jurisdiction. There is nothing in the Philippine
bill of rights that forbids assaults on two individuals being
treated as two offenses, even if they occur very near each other
in one continuing attempt to defy the law. *We cannot revise
the finding of the courts below that the two offenses were

distinct.
Judgment affirmed.

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 29.

Argued October 30, 1907.-Decided December 16, 1907.

Section 4965, Rev. Stat., as amended by the act of March 2, 1895, 28 Stat.
965, is penal in nature and cannot be extended by construction; it contemplates a single action for the recovery of plates and copies infringing a
copyright, and for the money penalty for the copies found. Such an action
is wholly statutory and all the remedies given by the statutes must be exhausted therein, and after the owner of the copyright has recovered judgment for possession of the plates and copies he cannot maintain a separate
action to recover the money penalty.
There is no requirement in ยง 4965, Rev. Stat., that the United States shall be
a party to the action provided for the recovery of plates and copies found
