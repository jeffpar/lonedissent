SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 80. Submitted October 14, 1924.-Decided November 24, 1924.
In the provision of the Act of 1916 (§ 14-a, Tit. I, Part II, 39 Stat.
756) adding the sum of 5% to delinquent income tax and "interest"
at the rate of 1% per month upon the tax from the time it became
due, the interest is not penal but compensatory, and its allowance,
on a claim by the Government against a bankrupt, is therefore consistent with § 57-j of the Bankruptcy Act. New York v. Jersawit,

The Government is entitled to interest upon its claim
at the rate of one per centum per month.
While § 57-j of the Bankruptcy Act forbids the allowance of penalties against the estate of a bankrupt, it
specifically allows "such interest as may have accrued

...according to law." The law allowing interest in
such cases as this is § 14(a) of the Revenue Act.
The word "interest" is clearly used here in contradistinction to the five per centum which manifestly belongs
to the category of penalties. The Treasury Department
has consistently so held. The distinction between "penalty" and "interest" is also recognized by the revenue
laws of other years.
The word "interest" is to be understood in its ordinary
sense.
United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496. To hold
that Congress intended to use the word in the sense of a
penalty is contrary to all rules of interpretation and invokes a special definition of the word "interest" that is
unwarranted. United States v. Guest, 143 Fed. 456;

Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

The United States is bound by the Bankruptcy Act.
GuaranteeCo. v. Title GuarantyCo., 224 U. S. 152; U. S.
Fidelity Co. v. Bray, 225 U. S. 205; United States v.
Wood, 290 Fed. 109; affd. 263 U. S. 680.
In the determination of the question as to whether federal taxes bear interest, § 63-a of the Bankruptcy Act
must likewise be considered. Debts do not bear interest
after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. Sexton v.
Dreyfus, 219 U. S.339. Section 57-j of the Bankruptcy
Act provides for the payment of "such interest as may
have accrued thereon according to law." What other law
could have been intended than the law that a debt
bears interest until the date of the filing of the petition in
bankruptcy? Swarts v. Hammer, 194 U. S.441, distinguished.
If the Government is entitled to interest on its claim
until paid, the rate of interest should not be more than 6
per cent. per annum. Sun PrintingAssn. v. Moore, 183

MR. JUSTICE McKENKA

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Collector of Internal Revenue of the Second District of New York filed a claim against the Trustee in
Bankruptcy of J. Menist Company, Inc., Edward H.
Childs, in the sum of $2,421.75, plus 5% penalty and 1%
interest per month thereon until paid. The claim was
for an additional income tax for the year 1917.
The justification for the claim, as stated by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, is: "Act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat.
300, sec. 212), making sec. 14(a) of the act of September
8, 1916 (39 Stat. 756), applicable to taxes under the 1917
act." By § 14(a) of Title I, Part II, of the Act of 1916,
it is provided that: ". . . to any sum or sums due and

Opinion of the Court.

unpaid after the fifteenth day of June in any year, or after
one hundred and five days from the date on which the return of income is required to be made by the taxpayer, and
after ten days' notice and demand thereof by the collector,
there shall be added the sum of five per centum on the
amount of tax unpaid and interest at the rate of one per
centum per month upon said tax from the time the same
becomes due."
As an element for consideration in connection with
§ 14(a) is § 57-j of the Bankruptcy Act. It reads as follows: "Debts owing to the United States, a State, a
county, a district, or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for the amount of the
pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with
reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such
interest as may have accrued thereon according to law."
The Government withdrew its claim for 5% penalty but
urged its claim for 1% interest.
The Referee, however, decided that the cited provisions
constitute a statutory characterization or definition
."
not only as to the 5% penalty but also in respect
to the 1% interest per month, and relieved the estate in
bankruptcy from its payment. He allowed the claim for
$2,421.75 with interest at 6% per anum to the date of payment.
The order was affirmed by the District Court. This was
affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and its action is
now here for review.
At the outset we are confronted with the difference between penalty and interest. A penalty is a means of punishment; interest a means of compensation. Bouvier defines it to be "a consideration paid for the use of money
or for forbearance in demanding it when due." This
Court has declined to give it peremptory definition, and
construing statutes considered that it could "safely de-

cline either to limit" the word debts "to existing dues, or
to extend its meaning so as to embrace all dues of whatever origin and description." Lane County v. Oregon, 7
Wall. 71, 79. See also New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S.
483, 493. To what conclusion does like liberty of construction conduct in the present case?
The imposition of a tax is certainly a function of government and creates an obligation, and the power that
creates the obligation can assign the measure of its delinquency-the detriment of delay in payment; and § 14(a)
has done so in this case, and explicitly done so. Five per
centum penalty is the cost of delinquency, and interest
upon the amount due at 1% per month-12% a year.
There is no ambiguity in the declaration nor the distinction made. Against their clearness and completeness
§ 57-j of the Bankruptcy Act is cited.
The Government yields as to the 5% penalty. It resists as to the 1% interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the 1% was involved as well, as being in effect penalty and not saved by its name, though it
was imposed by the legislature and within the legislative
power, and notwithstanding that taxes are treated as debts
within the~meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. In re Sherwoods, 210 Fed. 754, 758; Kaw Boiler Works v. Schull,
230 Fed. 587.
The Circuit Court of Appeals adjudged the tax in the
present case a debt and assigned against it interest at
6%; the court considering that that interest was compensation for the delinquency, anything in excess becoming
penalty and within the prohibition of § 57-j. The court
said, "On the point at bar [one per cent. interest as the
price of the delay being penalty] we are in accord with
Re Ashland, etc., 229 Fed. 829, and hold that there being
no evidence of any injury or damage to the Government
by the withholding of this tax except that which flows
from the nonpayment of a just debt, anything in excess of

UNITED STATES v. CHILDS.
304

Opinion of the Court.

the legal rate of interest is to be treated as a penalty and
not allowed."
We are unable to concur. It makes the rate of interest
that of a particular locality, differing with the localityin New York, as said by the Government, 6%, in the
middle West 8% and on the Pacific coast 10%,---and
abridges or controls a federal statute by a local law or
custom, and takes from it uniformity of operation. Besides, the federal statute is precise, and it is made pereinp.
tory by the distinction between "penalty" and "interest ", and if it may be conceded that the use of the
latter word would not save it from condemnation if it
were in effect the former, it cannot be conceded that 1%
per month-12% a year-gives it that illegal effect, certainly not against legislative declaration that is within
the legislative power, there being no ambiguity to resolve.
To this conclusion New York v. Jersawit, 263 U. S. 493,
is not antagonistic. There a statute of New York was
passed on which required "every domestic corporation"
to "annually pay in advance . . . an annual franchise tax" upon its net income for the year next preceding, and provided that, if the tax were not paid, the corporation should pay "in addition to the amount of such
tax . . . ten per centum of such. amount, plus one
per centum for each month the tax . . . remains unpaid." This liability the lower federal courts pronounced
a penalty and not to be allowed. In that conclusion this
Court concurred and decided that, being penalty, it was
disallowed by the Bankruptcy Act, § 57-j. And this not
only because the one per centum was "more than the
value of the use of the money" but because it was added
by the statute to the 10% to make a single sum and "must
be treated as part of one corpus and must fall with that."
The tax in this case is one on income; a burden imposed
for the support of the Government. Interest is put upon
it and so denominated, distinguished from the 5% as pen-
