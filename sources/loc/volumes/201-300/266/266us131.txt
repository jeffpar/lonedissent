Nos. 55 and 59.

Argued October 9, 1924.--Decided November 17,
1924.

1. An appeal is a proceeding in the original cause and the suit is
pending until the appeal is disposed of. P. 142.
2. Where the owner of corporate shares, the unendorsed certificate
for which was held by another as collateral to a note, at first prevailed in a suit brought by the latter in a Kentucky court to enforce the note and the lien, and, under permission of the judgment,
withdrew the stock certificate, filed as an exhibit, and procured the
shares to be transferred by the corporation to others, held:
(a) That a final judgment, entered after a reversal, sustaining the
plaintiff's claim, ordering that the shares be publicly sold, and
confirming a sale so made to the plaintiff, was binding, with respect to his ownership so acquired, upon the assignees of the shares,
who so took them pending the appeal, although the plaintiff had
obtained no supersedeas of the original judgment, and, owing to
the tactics pursued by his opponents, had bought them in at far
less than their true value. P. 143. '

(b) That Kentucky Civ. Code § 747, providing that "an appeal
shall not stay proceedings on the judgment unless a supersedeas be
issued," was inapplicable. P. 143.
(c) That the plaintiff's rights, under the state judgment, to have
the shares with accrued dividends or their value was absolute as
against the corporation, (which allowed the transfer with notice
of the suit,) and were not diminished in equity by his failure to
procure the supersedeas, or to pursue the assignees of the stock,
(since he was not bound to do either,) nor by the low price he
paid for the shares. Id.
286 Fed. 813, reversed.

on petitions of both sides, to review a
decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals which modified a
decree for the plaintiff, Mackenzie, in his suit to compel
the defendant corporation to deliver to him a certificate
for shares of its stock, or to pay him their value, and for
an accounting of all dividends declared since his purchase
of the shares at a judicial sale.
Mr. William Marshall Bullitt, with whom Mr. Samuel
B. King was on the brief, for Mackenzie.
Mackenzie became the full legal owner of the 130 shares
of stock, as purchaser at a valid judicial sale, duly confirmed by the state court.
The court could adjudge a lien on the shares of stock
without retaining the physical custody of the certificate
itself, which it had erroneously surrendered to Eschmann under the original judgment. When that judgment
was reversed, and Eschmaim's executors were decreed to
return the certificate to the court, their failure could not
affect the power of the court to adjudge a lien upon the
stock to secure the payment of the note on which it was
pledged. Sprague v. Cocheco Mfg. Co., Fed. Cas. No.
13,249.
The stock stands in the name of the original transferees
and no rights of bona fide purchasers for value, without
notice, have arisen.
CERTIoRARI,

MACKENZIE v. ENGELHARD CO.
131

Argument for Mackenzie.

Neither the judgment, order of sale, nor order of confirmation, was ever appealed from, and they cannot be
collaterally attacked here.
Whether (a) a lien could be created by pledging a
certificate of stock without endorsing it in blank, or (b)
the compulsory surrender of the possession of the pledged
thing under order of court destroys the lien, or (c) a
court's commissioner must have physical possession of
the thing sold at the time of the sale, or (d) corporate
stock could be sold and a bill of sale made therefor without having the mere evidence thereof in the shape of the
stock certificate present-were all matters which, whether
decided rightly or wrongly, could only affect the correctness of the judgment and not its validity.
Any rights acquired by Eschmann, or by his wife or
attorney through him, under the lower state court original
decree, were subject to be divested by a reversal.
The Engelhard Company's act in transferring the stock
pending the appeal was voluntary,-not done under or
pursuant to the judgment.
Putting to one side cases of purchasers under judicial
sales (where for reasons of public policy judicial sales are
protected even in the event of reversal, 96 Am. St. Rep.
136, note), the law is well settled that even if a bona fide
purchase, for value, is made after an appeal is taken, the
purchaser's title remains subject to the final decision of
the appellate court; and hence his title is lost if that results in a reversal. Kirkland v. Trott, 75 Ala. 321; Real
Estate Say. Co. v. Collonious, 63 Mo. 290; Carrv. Cates,

Argument for Mackenzie.

266 U. S.

An appeal is a mere continuation of the original suit,
so that the lis pendens established by the suit continues
until the expiration of the time for appeal; 'or, in the
event of appeal, until the final disposition of the case by
the appellate court. Golden v. Riverside Coal Co., 184
Ky. 200; Webb v. Webb's Guardian,178 Ky. 152. Fidelity Trust Co. v. Louisville Banking Co., 119 Ky. 675;
Langley v. Warner, 3 N. Y. 327; Bank of United States
v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 19; and Fidelity Mutual
Life Ins. Co. v. Clark, 203 U. S. 64, distinguished.
The basis of the decision in the Fidelity Trust Co. Case
was the difference between money and property, as is
shown by Webb v. Webb's Guardian,supra, and Golden
v. Riverside Coal Co., supra. See also, Phelps v. Elliott,
35 Fed. 455.
A creditor receiving payment out of money lawfully
in the plaintiff's hands, occupies a very different position
from a corporation which chooses to transfer corporate
stock upon its books at the request of an ostensible
owner, with full knowledge that another person is claiming title thereto.
Having procured the ruling dismissing it as a party,
the Engelhard Company is now estopped from claiming
that it should have been a party to the suit or that
Mackenzie should have pursued some other course.
Donivhan v. Gill, 1 B. Mon. 199; Taylor v. Cook, 136
Ala. 354; Kelly v. Norwich Co., 82 Ia. 137.
Mackenzie, having acquired title to the stock, was entitled to demand a transfer thereof on the company's
books, and when it refused he could maintain an action,
in equity, to compel a transfer of the stock to him and
an accounting for dividends paid since he became the
owner. St. Romes v. Cotton Press Co., 127 U. S. 614;

The law in Kentucky is to the same effect. Bank of
Kentucky v. Winn, 110 Ky. 140; see also Ramage v.
Gould, 176 Cal. 746.
To a suit of that kind, the corporation is the only
necessary party; and third persons claiming to hold certificates for the same stock are not necessary parties. St.
Romes v. Cotton Press Co., 127 U. S. 614; Skinner v.
Fort Wayne R. Ca., 58 Fed. 55.
When a corporation knows that there are rival claimants to a certificate of stock, which controversy is in litigation, it acts at its peril in deciding between them; and
if the corporation "guesses wrong" as to which will ultimately have the better title, it is responsible to the rightful owner. 1 Machen's Modern Law of Corporations,
§ 935; Miller.v. Doran, 245 Ill. 200.
The company could have protected itself-either by
interpleader or refusal to transfer the stock until the
appeal was decided, or by demanding a bond of indemnity. See note to O'Neil v. Wolcott Mining Co., 174
Fed. 527; 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 200, 201; Mundt v. Commercial Natl. Bank, supra,p. 1030, note 1; 7 R. C. L. 268.
If a corporation issue new certificates to one not the
true owner thereof, the owner can maintain a suit in
equity against the corporation to compel the issuance of
new certificates to him, or, in the alternative, to recover
the value of his stock. Black v. Zacharle & Co., 3 How.
483; Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, 97 U. S. 369; Moores
v. Citizens' Natl. Bank, 111 U. S. 156; St. Romes v.

The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in limiting Mackenzie's recovery to his original $7,500 debt and interest.

It, in effect, denied the full faith and credit to the state
court judgment, which by statute it is required to accord.
Rev. Stats., § 905; Cooper v. Newell, 173 U. S. 555;
Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Clarksdale, 257
U. S.10.
A federal court, in equity, is not entitled to decide a
case according to its individual ideas of what the result
should be, but it is bound by the fixed principles of
jurisprudence, one of which is that it must give to the
judgment of a state court, having personal jurisdiction
of the parties, the same effect as to the rights arising
therefrom, as would be accorded by the judgment in the
State where rendered. Cooper v. Newell, 173 U. S.555.
The Circuit Court of Appeals misconceived the nature
of the equitable principle invoked by it to justify its
disregard of Mackenzie's legal title to the stock and its
award of damages measured by a lien that had ceased to
exist. Magniac v. Thomson, 15 How. 281; Betzler v.
James, 227 Mo. 375. See also Old Colony Trust Co. v.
.M1edfieldStreet Ry. Co., 215 Mass. 156; York v. Trigg,
87 Okla. 214; Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat.
738.

Mr. J. Verser Conner, with whom Mr. Percy NV. Booth
was on the brief, for A. Engelhard & Sons Company.
The first judgment decreed that Mackenzie had no
cause of action against Eschmann and no lien on the
stock, and directed that the certificate be delivered to
Eschmann. More than two months thereafter, Eschmann withdrew the certificate from court, and more than
three and one-half months thereafter presented the certificate to the corporation and demanded its transfer.
Is the corporation liable for making such transfer? If
it is, its liability is, of course, wholly dependent upon
its knowledge of the litigation between Mackenzie and
Eschmann.

.MACKENZIE v. ENGELHARD CO.
131

Argument'for Engelhard Co.

Section 747 of the Civil Code of Kentucky: "An appeal
shall not stay proceedings on the judgment unless a supersedeas be issued."
The transferees who took while the first judgment was
in effect, took a good title. Fidelity Trust Co. v. Louisville Banking Co., 119 Ky. 675; Bank of United States v.
Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 19.
Admitting that the transferees knew of the litigation,
the fact is that they took title at a time when the title of
Eschmann to the stock was free from encumbrance by
virtue of the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court.
The notice, therefore, that Mackenzie might appeal
and get that judgment reversed could not be made to
take the place of a supersedeas bond. When the case was
reversed and the new judgment entered, Mackenzie acquired a perfectly valid right as against Eschmann, but no
right as against Eschmann's transferees.
A more recent decision of this Court illustrates the same
principle. Fidelity Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Clarke, 203
U. S.64; Langley v. Warner, 3 N: Y. 327; Wood's Administratorv. Nelson's Administrator,9 B. Mon. 600.
"Whatever is lawfully done under the judgment before
the supersedeas takes effect is valid and must stand." 37
Cyc. 602; 2 R. C. L., pp. 273, 291.
Consequently Mackenzie was bound by the judgment
of the court permitting Eschmann to withdraw the stock
and his alleged lien was lost thereby. His only chance to
save it was to supersede.that judgment. Hey v. Harding,
25 Ky. L. Rep. 1454; Garrettv. Jensen, 44 Cal. App. 99.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Argument for Engelhard Co.

266 U. S.

The corporation which was not a party to the litigation
in the lower court cannot be held liable for a tort in doing
an act which, when done, was justified by a subsisting
judgment. Bridges v. McAlister, 106 Ky. 791.
One who acts in a manner justified by a subsisting and
unsuperseded judgment is protected, even though the act
is not done by compulsion of the judgment. Porter v.
Small, 62 Oreg. 574; Hall v. Smith-McKenney Co., 162
Ky. 159; Stephens v. Willis, 21 Ky. L. Rep. 170.
An interpleader proceeding by the corporation would
have been useless, as the respective rights of Mackenzie
and Eschmann to the stock were res judicata when the
corporation transferred it. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort,
191 U. S. 499.
Eschmann had the right to demand that his stock be
transferred even though Mackenzie had a lien thereon.
First Natl. Bank v. Bowman, 168 Ky. 433; National City
Bank v. Wagner, 216 Fed. 473.
Had the corporation refused to transfer upon Eschmann's demand, it would have rendered itself liable in
damages. The possibility of an appeal from the judgment did not justify refusal of the corporation to act in
accordance with the judgment. American Natl. Bank v.
Douglas, 126 Ark. 7.
A corporation is not liable for registering a voidable
transfer. Casey v. Kastell, 237 N. Y. 305.
The corporation cannot inquire into the validity, as
between the parties, of a transfer of its stock. Having
lawfully transferred the stock in 1915, it was not liable
for refusal to reissue it in 1919. 6 Fletcher's Cyc. of
Corporations, p. 6412; Machen, Corporations, § 934.
Even if the transfer was wrongful, no liability attaches,
because (a) no loss is shown to have been suffered by
Mackenzie, and (b) the transfer on the books was not
essential to the transfer of title, and such transfer on the

MACKENZIE v. ENGELHARD CO.
131

Argument for Engelhard Co.

books was not the proximate cause of any loss suffered
by Mackenzie. Smith v. Railroad, 91 Tenn. 221.
The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding that
it was bound by the decisions of this Court to hold the
transfer on the corporate books to be the proximate
cause of loss to Mackenzie. Eschmann, being the owner,
had a right to demand and enforce, the transfer of his
stock on February 20, 1915, in spite of any lien of Mackenzie's. Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, 97 U. S. 369; St.
Romes v. Cotton Press Co., 127 U. S. 614, distinguished.
The distinction between the liability of a corporation
for making a transfer without authority from the true
owner, and its liability for making such transfer pursuant
to the direction of the true owner but in violation of some
equitable rights of third persons, was aptly pointed out
by Judge Lurton. Smith v. Railroad,91 Tenn. 221..
As for the refusal of the corporation to transfer the
stock to Mackenzie after his alleged purchase at the judicial sale, obviously, if the corporation acted lawfully.
when it transferred the stock to Eschmann's assignees, it
could not be liable for refusing to do an impossible thing,
that is, to issue the stock to Mackenzie four years thereafter. Engelhard Company was not a party to the litigation when the judgment relied on was entered and had
not been for something like six years. The judgment,
therefore, cannot bind the company as res judicata. McCallisterv. Bridges, 19 Ky. L. Rep. 107; Everidge v. Martin, 164 Ky. 497.
Mackenzie's title to the stock as purchaser has not been
adjudged. He took only the title which Eschmann had,
and that was no title. Beale v. Stroud, 191 Ky. 755.
By voluntarily relinquishing possession of the certificate through his failure to supersede the judgment,
Mackenzie lost his lien.

140

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

The attempted sale of the chattel not in the court's
possession, (the corporation not being a party) was
ineffective to convey title.
The order of sale and bill of sale did not describe the
thing sold sufficiently to effect a valid sale.
A court of equity will not enforce rights claimed under
a judgment unless it be shown that the enforcement of
such rights would produce equity. 23 Cyc. p. 1432;
Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Janesville Cotton Mills, 138 U. S.
552; Gay v. Parpart,106 U. S. 679; Wadhams v. Gay,
73 fll. 415.
This is the rule recognized, but we submit misapplied,
by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case at bar. If
Mackenzie could show, first, that he had been deprived
of the means of collecting his original debt, and second,
that he had been so deprived by the action of the corporation, and third, that the corporation was not justified
in making the transfer in reliance on the judgment, there
might be some ground to contend that a court of equity
should lend him its aid. In this case, he wants to punish
the corporation which acted in good faith and in reliance
on the judgment of the court; and he wants to gain for
himself a net profit of more than $30,000, though there
is no equity in his claim.
A federal court should decline to exercise its equitable
powers to enforce an inequitable claim based upon a state
court judgment. Hassall v. Wilcox, 130 U. S. 493; Gay
v. Parpart,supra.
The case should be remanded to the District Court
with directions to dismiss the petition.
MR. JUsTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a bill brought by Mackenzie to compel the defendant corporation, A. Engelhard & Sons Company, to
deliver to the plaintiff one hundred and thirty shares of

MACKENZIE v. ENGELHARD CO.
131

Opinion of the Court.

stock formerly represented by certificate numbered 24, to
the defendant, or to pay to him the value of the same,
and the amount of all dividends declared upon the shares
since July 15, 1918. The grounds are these.
The plaintiff, being holder of a note for $7,500 and of
the above mentioned certificate then standing in the
name of F. W. R. Eschmann and unendorsed but stated
in the note to be security, brought a suit against Eschmann, and others, makers of the note, and the corporation, in the Jefferson Circuit Court of Kentucky, to recover upon the note, to have it declared a lien upon the
said stock and to have the lien enforced. He filed the
certificate as an exhibit. The corporation was dismissed
from the suit upon its demurrer, but of course had notice
thereafter that the suit was pending and that the plaintiff claimed an interest in the stock.

Indeed, the plain-

tiff had previously sought to have the certificate that he
held transferred to him as pledgee but had been refused.
On November 7, 1914, judgment was rendered for the
defendants and it was further adjudged that the defendant F. W. R. Eschmann be "permitted" to withdraw the
certificate from the exhibits, leaving a copy in the record.
The plaintiff prayed an appeal but did not obtain a
supersedeas, as he might have by giving a bond.
Eschmann withdrew the certificate and on February 20,
1915, obtained in place of it new dertificates to his wife
and his attorney. On April 26, 1915, the plaintiff perfected his appeal to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.
On March 6, 1917, the Court of Appeals reversed the
judgment below, 174 Ky. 450; and on October 31, 1917,
final judgment was entered in the Jefferson Circuit Court
that the plaintiff should recover the sum demanded and
that he had a lien upon certificate No. 24, and the shares
represented by it and upon any certificates that might
have been issued by the corporation to the defendants,

142

266 U.S.

then the executors of F. W. R. Eschmann, deceased, in
lieu of No. 24, to secure the plaintiff in the payment of
the debt and costs. It was adjudged further that the
shares should be sold and that the defendants should return the certificate to the Court. On July 15, 1918, a
sale was had, but the attorney for the defendants, who
also is attorney for the corporation, attended and gave
notice that the certificate had been sold by Eschmann
and had been canceled. The plaintiff bought for one
hundred dollars and on October 30, 1918, the sale was
confirmed by the Court. Subsequently he demanded a
certificate from the corporation but was refused. All its
stock had been issued.
In the present case the District Court decreed that the
plaintiff recover his original debt and interest, with a
dividend declared after the purchase lSy the plaintiff, in
all $13,354.75, with interest from the date of the decree
until paid. Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court
of Appeals. That Court, while agreeing that the plaintiff was entitled to relief against the corporation, held
that as the plaintiff had not obtained a supersedeas to the
first judgment in the former suit and had taken no proceedings before the sale to establish what title would pass
by it, his relief in equity should be limited to the amount
of the debt, interest and costs in the other suit up to the
time of sale, although the plaintiff's right was absolute at
law. 286 Fed. 813. Writs of certiorari were issued on
the petitions of both sides. [262 U. S. 739.]
It does not seem to us to need argument to establish
that the sale to the plaintiff was effectual as against the
parties to the suit. The decree confirming the sale was
final and not appealed from. We believe the rule in
Kentucky to be that purchasers pendente lite would
stand in the defendant's shoes. An appeal is a proceeding in the original cause and the suit is pending until the

MACKENZIE v. ENGELHARD CO.
131

Opinion of the Court.

appeal is disposed of. Therefore, apart from more special considerations applicable here but not needing mention, the assignees of the stock stood no better than
Eschmann unless they were helped by the provision that
"an appeal shall not stay proceedings on the judgment
unless a supersedeas be issued" in the Kentucky Civil
Code. § 747. But there was no question here of any
proceedings on the judgment. When the final judgment
was reached it determined the rights of Eschmann ab
initio, and it seems to us impossible to believe that it
did not also determine the rights of the assignees. We
understand that this would be the view of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals. Golden v. Riverside Coal & Timber
Co., 184 Ky. 200, 205.
The liability of the corporation rightly was found to
exist by both Courts below. The company might be liable
even without fault, and if for any reason it were unable
to restore the stock it might be answerable for its value.
Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, 97 U. S. 369, 372. Moores
v. Citizens' National Bank, 111 U. S. 156, 166. But here,
as we have said, it had notice of the suit. It knew that
the first judgment might be reversed, as it was, upon
appeal, and was entitled to protect itself, as it might have
and for all that appears may have done, when it issued
the new certificates. We perceive no reason in the Kentucky Civil Code for distinguishing between its position
and that of the assignees.
We come then to the question whether equity requires
any diminution of the rights acquired by the plaintiff
under the judicial sale to him. It is adjudged that his
rights are absolute. It is a strong thing to cut down his
rights under the judgment of the State Court. The
parties stood upon equal ground. Without going .further
into the facts each seems to have been trying to get the
better of the other and neither can get much help from
atmospheric considerations. The plaintiff did not care

to assume the liabilities of a supersedeas bond, but if the
defendant .took no steps to protect itself it might have
done so. The plaintiff was not bound to pursue the assignees of the stock before looking to the corporation.
St. Romes v. Levee Steam Cotton Press Co., 127 U. S.
614, 620. It is immaterial what were the' limits of the
plaintiff's original interest; he comes before this Court as
absolutely entitled to the stock and the preliminaries to
his acquiring the title have no bearing on the case. He
got it at a better bargain than he would have done had
his adversaries taken a different course, but he got it and
his right is not to be impugned. See Miller v. Doran,245
