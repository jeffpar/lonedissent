2. Lewis & Fox Co. is a Massachusetts corporation conducting a general provision supply business including the
shipment and sale of original packages into and within
the State of New York. It is this situation which forms
the basis of the contention that the commerce clause is
violated. It is enough to say that the statutes now assailed are not aimed at interstate commerce, do not impose a direct burden upon such commerce, make no discrimination against it, are fairly within the range of the
police power of the State, bear a reasonable relation to
the legitimate purpose of the enactments, and do not
conflict with any congressional legislation. Under these
circumstances they are not invalid because they may incidentally affect interstate commerce. Sligh v. Kirkwood,

and merits cannot be reopened either by the District Court or

in disobeying an order made to enforce a mandate from the

APPEAL from an order of the District Court commanding the appellant to make a payment, as ordered by a
referee in bankruptcy, and fining the appellant for contumacy in having refused to do so. The referee's order

payable to the bank. August 16th following, a petition
in bankruptcy was filed against the Grain Company,
upon which it was adjudicated a bankrupt. After the
petition was filed the bankupt paid the amount of the
note, and, thereafter, appellant succeeded to all the
assets and rights and assumed all the liabilities of the
American National. Upon these facts the trustee in bankruptcy filed a motion with the referee to summarily require appellant to restore the amount of such payment.
Appellant, by proper pleading, denied the jurisdiction of
the referee, insisted that the trustee should proceed by a
plenary suit, and alleged that the note was secured by
property of the bankrupt and that the payee bank was
entitled to priority of payment. The referee found that
the note was not so secured, that appellant had no color
of right to the payment made. after the commencement
of the bankruptcy proceedings, and ordered appellant to
pay over to the trustee the amount received. The findings and conclusions of the referee were approved by an
order of the district court, and its order was affirmed upon
petition to revise by the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, 295 Fed. 120; and this court denied a petition for
certiorari. 264 U. S. 588. After the mandate had gone
down to the district court, the referee ordered appellant to
comply therewith, but appellant refused to do so, which
refusal was certified to the district court for its action. At
the same time the trustee moved the court for an order
to compel compliance with the mandate. After a hearing
the district court found appellant guilty of contempt, and,
in addition to commanding payment of the amount ordered by the referee, imposed a fine of $2,500, as punishment for appellant's contumacious behavior, one-half payable to the United States and one-half to the trustee in
bankruptcy. From this order appellant 'has not only
taken this appeal but also a petition to revise to the
circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

Appellee has submitted a motion to dismiss the appeal
or affirm the decree of the district court upon the grounds,
among others, that this court is without authority to
entertain the appeal, and that there is no substance in
the questions sought to be presented. The motion to dismiss must be granted.
Upon the appeal here appellant seeks a review of the
order adjudging appellant in contempt and also of the
jurisdictional issues disposed of by the original decree
approving the action of the referee which the circuit court
of appeals refused to disturb. All questions concerning
the validity and merits of that decree were finally disposed of by the decree of the circuit court of appeals and
the denial of the application for a certiorari by this court.
The district court was bound to give effect to the decision
of the circuit court of appeals; so that what, in effect, we
are asked to do is to review and reverse the decree of the
latter. The power here to review that decree has been
exhausted; but, in any event, it could not be exercised
upon direct appeal or error. Brown v. Alton Water Co.,
222 U. S. 325, 331-334; Carter v. Roberts, 177 U. S. 496,
500; Union Trust Co. v. Westhus, 228 U. S. 519, 522524; Metropolitan Co. v. Kaw Valley District, 223 U. E
519, 522-524; Shapiro v. United States, 235 U. S. 412,
415-417.
It follows that the only questions open for consideration are those arising from the contempt order. But
that order, being in part punitive, takes character from
its criminal feature and, ordinarily, such an order is not
open to review by this court upon direct appeal or error.

641-642. It may be said in passing that the case is here
upon appeal not upon writ of error, the appropriate mode
of review in criminal contempts; but that is unimportant
under c. 448, § 4, 39 Stat. 726, 727, requiring disregard of
such mistakes.
Appellant insists, however, that the jurisdiction of this
court attaches upon the grounds that the district court
was without jurisdiction to make the order and that
there was a denial of constitutional rights. See Grant v.
United States, 227 U. S. 74, 78-79. Jurisdiction of the
district court here over the person and over the subjectmatter of contempts is beyond question; and the challenge to the jurisdiction, as well as the assumed denial of
constitutional rights, apparently, are made to rest only
upon the assertion that it was not within the power of
the referee or the district court, as a court of bankruptcy,
to require the bank, by a summary order, to restore to the
trustee the amount of the payment in question; the contention being that the only remedy was by plenary action
with the right of trial by jury. Bu, since the decision of
the circuit court of appeals, as already stated, is conclusively against appellant upon that issue, and prevented
any further consideration of it by the district court, the
asserted basis for a direct resort to this court is without
any substance.
Appeal dismissed.
