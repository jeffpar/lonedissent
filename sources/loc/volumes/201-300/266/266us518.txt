evidence both courts below found the fact to be that
appellee, Larney, was the person to whom the commission's decision related and to whom the allotment was
made. The well-settled rule of this court is that where
two courts have reached the same conclusion upon a
question of fact it will be accepted here unless clearly
erroneous. Bodkin v. Edwards, 255 U. S. 221, 223;
Baker v. Schofield, 243 U. S. 114, 118. An examination
of the evidence not only fails to disclose such clear error
but; on the contrary, establishes the conclusion of the
lower courts by a clear preponderance.
Decree affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 78.

Argued October 15, 16, 1924.-Decided January 5, 1925.

1. Where by the terms and conditions set forth in the advertisement of a public sale of public property acceptance of a bid will
not be final until execution of a contract between the bidder and
the United States reserving to the Government the right to rescind
the sale within a time specified, the Government may exercise the
option by refusing to make such contract with the bidder to whom
the property has been knocked down, and such refusal gives the
bidder no cause of action against the United States. P. 520.
2. Rev. Stats., ยง 3744, requiring contracts to be reduced to writing
and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end
thereof, applies to public sales of surplus supplies by the Secretary
of War under the Act of July 11, 1919, 41 Stat. 105. P. 521.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, appeared for
the United States.
MR.JusTIcE BuTLE.R delivered the opinion of the Court.

The judgment appealed from sustained a demurrer to
plaintiff's petition and dismissed the case.
An act of Congress, approved July 11, 1919, 41 Stat.
105, authorized the Secretary of War to sell any surplus
supplies then owned by and in the possession of the Government for the use of the War Department "upon such
terms as may be deemed best." The petition alleged the
following facts: The Secretary of War advertised approximately 40,000 tons of nitrate of sodium for sale at public
auction at Washington, April 13, 1922. The advertisement stated that bidders would be required to make deposit of ten per cent. of the price of the nitrate purchased;
that acceptance of any bid would not be final until the
execution of a contract and bond and upon the failure by
purchaser within ten days after notice of the acceptance
of his bid to execute a contract, the United States might
withdraw such acceptance, make other disposition of the
nitrate, and retain the deposit as liquidated damages;
and that the purchaser would be required, upon acceptance of his bid and before delivery of any nitrate, to
enter into a written contract, providing that the Government "at its election may rescind said sale at any time
before August 1, 1922, in which event the purchaser shall
immediately

deliver to the Government

sodium nitrate in equal quantity with that theretofore
delivered by the Government to purchaser

.

.

.

and

the Government shall return to purchaser all money
theretofore received in payment for such nitrates, and
relieve him from any obligation for further payments
"

The auction was held, and plaintiff was the

highest bidder on three lots, amounting in all to 29,520

tons. The total of its bids was $711,500.' It deposited
more than ten per cent. of that amount. The three lots
were by the auctioneer knocked down and sold to plaintiff
for the amount of its bids and upon the terms and conditions of the advertisement. Plaintiff was ready to perform on its part, and demanded that the Secretary execute a contract of sale in accordance with the terms set
forth in the advertisement. But the Secretary refused
on the ground that the prices offered were inadequate.
Plaintiff's deposits were returned to it without prejudice
to any of its claims against the United States. The market value of the nitrate was $1,919,870. And, by the
petition, judgment was demanded for $1,208,370, the excess of market price over total of plaintiff's bids.
The terms and conditions of the sale as set forth in the
advertisement were binding alike upon the United States
and the bidders. If, after the receipt of plaintiff's bids,
the contemplated contract had been executed, the United
States thereby would have been authorized immediately
to rescind the sale and bring the matter to an end by return of the deposit. But the Secretary, unwilling to accept the bids, refused to execute a contract and returned
plaintiff's deposit. The right under the proposed contract
to rescind was the equivalent of a reservation, in the published terms and conditions of the auction sale, of the
right of vendor to reject any and all bids. Exercise of
the option to terminate the contract of sale would have
had the same effect and accomplished the same result as
the rejection of the bids. The Secretary was not bound
uselessly to execute the contract and then to rescind the
sale in order to give effect to his decision not to let plainSLot 1.

tiff have the nitrates at the prices offered. It follows that
the refusal of the Secretary to make the contract of sale
gave rise to no cause of action in favor of the plaintiff.
Moreover, ยง 3744, Revised Statutes, required the Secretary of War to cause every contract made by him, or by
officers under him appointed to make contracts, "to be
reduced to writing, and signed by thie contracting parties
with their names at the end thereof." The Act of July
11, 1919, authorizing the Secretary to sell surplus war
supplies, is not inconsistent with that section and does
not repeal or modify it. There is no reason why it should
not apply to contracts made in pursuance of the later
act. It must be held that, because of the failure to make
and sign a written contract as required by ยง 3744, the
United States was not bound. Clark v. United States, 95
U. S. 539, 541; South Boston Iron Co. v. United States,
