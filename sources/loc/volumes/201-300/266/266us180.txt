CROUCH, LEGAL GUARDIAN OF KONSTOVICH,
WIDOW, v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA, TRANSFERRED FROM
THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 61.

Argued October 10, 1924.-Decided November 17, 1924.

1. No authority exists to sue the United States for compensation
granted under the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917,
but terminated by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance upon the
ground of misconduct of the beneficiary. P. 181. Silberschein v.
United States, post, 221.
2. Where an action on a claim of insurance is brought in the District Court pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred by ยง 13 of
the War Risk Insurance Act, as amended by Act of May 20, 1918,
the judgment is reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but
a direct writ of error will not lie from this Court to the District
Court under the statutes applicable to this case. P. 182.
3. Section 19 of the World War Veterans' Act of June 7, 1924,
relating to the litigation of claims for insurance, was inapplicable

of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals, transferred to this Court under the Transfer Act, Jud. Code,
ยง 238 (a).
WRIT

Mr. James G. Martin and Mr. Ernest S. Merrill for
plaintiff in error.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, with whom
Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Harry S. Ridgely
were on the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Under the Act of Congress approved October 6, 1917,
c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, 409, the United States in February,
1918, issued to Stephen Konstovich a policy of insurance,

with Kathleen, his wife, as beneficiary. He went down
with the "Cyclops" March 31, 1918, and the full amount
of the policy, payable in monthly installments, was
awarded to plaintiff Crouch as her guardian. Another
award of twenty-five dollars per month was made to him,
as such guardian, on account of the husband's death.
Payments were regularly made until July 12, 1921,
when the Bureau of War Risk Insurance gave notice that
the beneficiary had terminated her claims for both insurance and compensation by misconduct. Thereupon
the guardian commenced this proceeding in the District
Court. The petition prays for judgment against the
United States and that they be directed to pay all installments which have or may accrue. The trial judge concluded that by misconduct the widow had terminated her
right to the insurance as of September 17, 1920; further,
that the United States had not consented to be sued upon
the award of compensation; and it dismissed the petition,
April 7, 1922. The cause went to the Circuit Court of
Appeals. That court, being of opinion that it was without jurisdiction, transferred the proceeding here. Act of
September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837.
Article III, Act of October 6, 1917, provides for compensation where death occurs in the line of duty. Section
305 declares, "That upon its own motion or upon application the bureau may at any time review an award,
and, in accordance with the facts found upon such review,
may end, diminish, or increase the compensation previously awarded, or, if compensation has been refused or
discontinued, may award compensation."
No authority to sue the United States for compensation
has been expressly granted, and that none exists under
circumstances like those here presented is determined by
Silberschein v. United States, decided today, past, 221.
Article IV, Act of October 6, 1917, provides generally
for the insurance of officers and enlisted men. Section

405--" That in the event of -disagreement as to a claim
under the contract of insurance between the bureau and
any beneficiary or beneficiaries thereunder, an action on
the claim may be brought against the United States in
the district court of the United States in and for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of them resides." Section 13, Act of 1917, as amended by the Act
of May 20, 1918, c. 77, 40 Stat. 555, 556, includes the
language just quoted from ยง 405.
In United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U. S. 457, we considered
the question of jurisdiction under a statute similar to the
one now before us and, in the course of discussion, pointed
out that the Act of May 20, 1918, conferred upon district
courts original jurisdiction over controversies arising out
of claims against the United States under contracts of
insurance. We adhere to the statement and hold that the
applicable statutes in force when the present proceedings
began did not authorize a direct writ of error from this
Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to
review the challenged judgment.
Section 19 of the Act approved June 7, 1924, c. 320,
43 Stat. 607, has no application to the present claim.
The cause must be returned to the Circuit Court of
Appeals with directions to proceed.
Case Transferred.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 60. Argued October 10, 1924.-Decided November 17, 1924.
A writ of certiorari will be dismissed if the case as relied on by the
petitioner in argument is not the case as presented in the petition
for the writ.
Writ of certiorari dismissed.
