Syllabus.

it-that it applies to cars with roofs and not to tenders,
they having no roofs. While the view of the Commission
is not conclusive with us, it is properly persuasive. We
agree with it. The trial court therefore erred in its charge
on the effect of the statute and as the verdict was general
with no special finding upon which the verdict could
stand without response to the statute, the case must go
back for a new trial.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
SANITARY DISTRICT OF CHICAGO v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 161.

Argued December 8, 9, 1924.-Decided January 5, 1925.

1. A suit to enjoin an agency of the State of Illinois from continuing diversions of water from Lake Michigan which lower that lake
and threaten the like effect upon other lakes and connecting waters
of the Great Lake System, including the St. Lawrence, is maintainable by the United States not only to remove obstruction to
interstate and foreign commerce, but also to carry out treaty
obligations to a foreign power. (Treaty of January 11, 1909, with
Great Britain, 36 Stat. 2448.) P. 425.
2. Semble that such a suit might also stand upon an ultimate sovereign interest in the Lakes. Id.
3. The suit may be brought by the Attorney General, in virtue of
his office, and it need not be authorized by a statute. P. 426.
4. The power of the United States to remove obstructions to interstate and foreign commerce is superior to that of the States to
provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants. Id.
5. Touching interstate and foreign commerce, in so far as the
States may act Congress can override what they have done; but,
in matters of imminent and direct national importance, they may
not act at all, even where Congress has -been silent. Id.

6. Irrespective of any international compact, a State cannot authorize diversions of water from the Great Lakes which will affect
their level, without the consent of Congress. P. 426.
7. Even if it were possible for the United States to estop itself by
grant or contract from exercising its power in matters of national
and international concern, its act must be strictly construed
against such a result. P. 427.
8. The Act of March 2, 1827, granting land to Illinois to open a
canal uniting the waters of the Illinois River with those of Lake
Michigan vested no irrevocable discretion in the State with
regard to the amount of water to be withdrawn from the Lake.
Id.
9. The withdrawal of water in this case, except in so far as it may
be authorized by the Secretary of War, is prohibited by the Act
of March 3, 1899, c. 425, § 10, 30 Stat 1151, as involving a change
in the condition of the Lakes and the Chicago River (admitted
to be navigable) and an obstruction to their navigable capacity.
P. 428.
10. Revocable licenses granted by the Secretary of War under the
above Act of 1899, concerning the appellant's canal and the quantity of water to be taken from Lake Michigan,-considered and
held no justification for the excessive diversions here complained
of by the Government. P. 429.
11. Refusal of the Secretary of War to license greater withdrawals
of water from Lake Michigan by the appellant through its canal,
for the sanitation of Chicago, did not infringe any rights of that
City arising from its investment in the canal property, or of
States bordering on the Mississippi based on their interest in
increasing the artificial flow; nor were those states or the city,
entitled to be heard before the license was refused. P. 431.
Affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court enjoining
the appellant from diverting water from Lake Michigan
in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute, the amount
authorized by the Secretary of War.

Clark, 272 Ill. 201, 213; Messages and Papers of the
Presidents, vol. 5, p. 3334.
Appellee, through its engineer officers and the Secretary of War, observed the action of the State of Illinois
and appellant pursuant to its authority in planning and
constructing the diversion works. The Secretary consented to the work necessary to accomplish the diversion
and authorized the opening of the main channel of the
district. He construed the Act of March 2, 1827, supra,
and the laws of Illinois, as affirmatively authorizing the
diversion.
The Secretary, charged with the duty of enforcing the
Rivers and Harbors Acts of 1890 and 1899, has thus construed a diversion to the capacity of appellant's canal,
to have been "affirmatively authorized by law" and
"affirmatively authorized by Congress." These acts of
the Secretary should have the force of judicial interpretation.
II. The permits of the Secretary of July 11, 1900, authorizing the work of deepening-and widening the channels of the Chicago River to provide for the diversion or
abstraction from Lake Michigan through them of the
amount of water required by the state law according to
the population of appellant, constituted all the authority
required by appellant from appellee, to divert said waters.

The Attorney General, under the Act of March 3, 1899,
is only authorized to institute suits for the removal of

to entertain this suit. Act of March 3, 1899, § 12; Ogden

The Secretary of War is only authorized to grant or
refuse a permit. He has no power to regulate the
diversion.
IV. The Illinois Act of May 29, 1889, was sufficient
legislative authority for appellant's diversion works and
for the diversion of water required by them. Cummings

Argument for Appellant.

The creation of appellant's canal and its other diversion
works, was "authorized by law" under the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 1890.' United States v. Bellingham Bay
Co., 176 U. S. 211.
The diversion is lawful under the police power without
the express consent of the Secretary of War. Any other
construction of the Act of March 3, 1899, would tend to
nullify appellant's acts in the interest of public health,
which cannot be where the congressional intention is not
expressed in plain and unmistakable terms. Columbus

As for the treaty between the United States and Great
Britain of January 11, 1909, relating to Canadian boundary waters,-when the treaty was made, the right to
divert this water by appellant and the State of Illinois
was recognized. That right was not in any respect curbed.
The treaty expressly eliminates from its terms by the
preliminary article, Lake Michigan. Lake Michigan is
not a boundary water, as defined by the treaty.
Article II of the treaty reserves to each of the parties,
or to the state governments, or provincial governments, as
the case may be, all rights over these nonboundary waters.
And again, in Art. III, it is stated: ". . . nor are
such provisions intended to interfere with the ordinary
use of such waters for domestic and sanitary purposes."
Article VIII expressly provides that the uses for domestic
and sanitary purposes shall be paramount.
The treaty thus completely protects the diversion at
Chicago. There was no dispute between the United
States and the Dominion of Canada as to the right to
divert 10,000 cubic seconds feet of water from Lake Michigan at Chicago. The International Waterways Commission, which was composed of representatives of the two

SANITARY DISTRICT v. UNITED STATES.

governments, settled that. Its two reports of May 3,
1906, and January 4, 1907, were signed by all the members of the Commission-three from the United States
and three from Canada. As to the diversion at Chicago,
the only question remaining unsettled was whether there
should be diverted more than 10,000 cubic seconds feet of
water.
Article II thus left unhampered the power of the sovereign over the waters that were not boundary waters
within the sovereign's territory, subject only-(1) to the
right of the citizens of one country to sue in the courts
of the other country for damages caused by a diversion
not then existing; (2) to the right merely of either party
to object to further diversions than those which existed,
to the injury of navigation. The Chicago diversion to
the amount of 10,000 seconds feet was found by the International Waterways Commission to be an existing diversion. The right of the sovereign having jurisdiction
over Lake Michigan, a nonboundary water, subject to
the conditions mentioned, was thus reserved. As to
those waters, the sovereign could do anything with them
it chose. The Exchange, 7 Cr. 116, 136. See also opinion of Judson Harmon on right of United States in the
Rio Grande, 21 Ops. Atty. Gen. 274, 280.
The waters which are diverted from Lake Michigan
at Chicago are wholly within the linits of the State of
Illinois.
The treaty is the law of the land, and may properly be
said to have been made, so far as the Chicago diversion
is concerned, for the benefit of the State of Illinois and
the appellant. The State or the appellant may compel
the recognition of such contract right. The treaty reserved the right of the sovereign-and the State is a
complete sovereign except as to those things delegated
to the Federal Government-over these waters. At
least the United States, by making the treaty, must be

construed to have acquiesced and consented to the diversions as they existed at the time, unless some definite
action were taken by Congress indicating a different intention.
VI. No witness was produced by appellee to testify
that lowering of the lake surfaces, or damage to commerce, was ever actually observed. Appellee's case depends entirely upon an inference of the unseen and the
subtle analyses of expert witnesses, which cannot form
the basis of an injunctional decree. Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 523; Joyce on Nuisances, 1906, ed.,
§§ 299 420; Salvin v. North Brancepeth Coal Co. L. R.
9, Ch. App. 705, 709; North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263
U. S. 365.
The injunction should not have been entered unless
the injury and damage to commerce was material and
the obstruction to navigation was unreasonable. United
States v. Rio Grande Co., 174 U. S. 690, 709; Corrigan
Transit Co. v. Sanitary District, 137 Fed. 851, 857; Lake
Shore etc. Ry. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285, 294; Cummings
v. Chicago, 188 U. S. 410, 428; Union Bridge Co. v.
United States, 204 U. S. 364, 365, 385, 400.
It must appear, in a case of this character, that an unreasonable obstruction and damage to commerce clearly
exist. New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 309;
Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 117; Attorney General v. Mayor, 13 Weekly Reporter, 1863-1865, 888;
Mississippi, etc. R. R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485, 495; 2
Story, Com. on Eq., 203, 204.
VII. If it appear that the granting of an injunction
would cause comparatively greater injury to the defendant than 'benefit to the complainant, a court of equity
will not hesitate to deny the relief. 1 Joyce on Injunctions, § § 20, 25; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46,

VIII. The statute does not authorize the Secretary to
make any findings or conclusions. If it did, they would
be subject to review. PhiladelphiaCo. v. Stimson, 223
U. S. 605, 620; Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S. 371; Rosenberger v. Harris, 136 Fed. 1001, 1002; United States v.
United Verde Copper Co., 196 U. S. 207, 215; School of
Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, 110.
In any event, Secretary Stimson's findings and conclusions were erroneous. Corrigan Transit Co. v. Sanitary
District, 137 Fed. 851, 855; Mortell v. Clark, 272 Ill. 201;
United States v. Rio Grande Co., 174 U. S. 690.
IX. The lower court should have granted the motion
that the appellant be enjoined from taking in excess of
10,000 cubic seconds feet of water from Lake Michigan
on condition that appellant pay the cost of constructing
such compensating or regulating works as the United
States should provide to be built to offset for the claimed
lowering of the lake surfaces and their connecting channels due to 10,000 seconds feet diversion at Chicago.
Admitting, for the sake of argument, only, all contentions of appellee to be true, appellant cannot be enjoined
from taking an amount of water materially less than
10,000 cubic seconds feet, until appellant and cities and
towns within its limits can, if at all, readjust their works
of sewage disposal and of purification of water supply
to suif the changed conditions.
The decree absolutely enjoined appellant from withdrawing from Lake Michigan in excess of 4,167 seconds
feet. The Secretary of War would be powerless under
it to authorize any further diversion.
This matter should be settled by Congress. New York

I. The Great Lakes, their connecting waters, and the
St. Lawrence River, are navigable waters of the United
States (The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443; United States
v. Rodgers, 150 U. S. 249; Illinois Cent. R. R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387,) and also "international waters, being
dedicated in perpetuity to the common navigation of all
the inhabitants" of the countries on both sides of- the
boundary, I Moore, Int. Law Dig., p. 675; I Hyde, Int.

Chandler-DunbarCo., 229 U. S. 53.
Their international character is confirmed by the
Boundary Waters Treaty of January 11, 1909. Lake
Michigan is likewise given an international character by
the covenant in Art. I, that the free and open navigation
provided for with respect to the boundary waters "shall
extend to the waters of Lake Michigan."

SANITARY DISTRICT v. UNITED STATES.

415

Argument for the United States.

II. The level of the Great Lakes and the diversion of
water from the St. Lawrence River basin to the Mississippi basin are both subjects of commerce regulation,
national (and also international) in character, such as
to require exclusive control by Congress. Independently, therefore, of any assertion of control by Congress,
the Illinois Act of 1889, in so far as it authorized and
directed the appellant to do the acts here complained
of without authorization of Congress, was void.
Appellant reiterates that its acts were "affirmatively
authorized by law" within the meaning of § 10 of the
Act of September 19, 1890;- but the Act of March 3,
1899, was enacted nearly a year before the appellant
(under the permit of May 8, 1899) accomplished a connection between its channel and the Chicago River and
thereby diverted water from Lake Michigan. The
basis for this contention, however, is a misapplication
of the decision in United tate&v. Bellingham Bay Co.,
176 U. S. 211,--which held that in the case of an obstruction of a navigable stream confined wholly within
the boundaries of a State, the words "affirmatively authorized by law" in the Act of 1890 included lawful
authorization by an act of the state legislature. Manifestly, an obstruction of a navigable water like Lake
Michigan or the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers could not
lawfully be authorized by legislation of a single State
either before or after the enactment of the Act of 1890.
It makes no difference whether interference with that
control proceeds from a state statute or from the acts of
individuals. Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. Kaw Valley District, 233 U. S. 75, 78.
Those subjects of interstate commerce which require a
general system or uniformity of regulation are national
in character, and as to such the power of Congress is exclusive; those admitting of diversity of treatment according to local conditions are local in character, and as to

such the States may act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act. Minnesota Rate
Cases, 230 U. S. 352; Covington Bridge Co. v. Kentucky,
154 U. S. 204; Wilmington Transp. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 236 U. S. 151.
Until Congress asserted its paramount control, the subject of obstructions to the navigable capacity of state
navigable waters, not affecting navigable waters without
the State, was deemed to be local in character and subject
to the authority of the State. See, (1), cases involving
dams across state navigable waters; Willson v. Black-bird
Creek Co., 2 Pet. 245; Pound v. Turck, 95 U. S. 459;
Huse v. Glover, 119 U. S. 543; and MonongahelaNay. Co.
v. United States, 148 U. S. 312; (2), cases involving
bridges across state navigable waters; Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713; Escanaba Co. v. Chicago, 107 U. S.
683; Cardwell v. American Bridge Co., 113 U. S. 205;

improvement of state navigable waters; Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84; Sands v. Manistee Co., 123 U. S. 288.
See Huse v. Glover, 119 U. S. 543.
The power of the States with respect to interstate navigable waters has at all times been limited to matters
purely local in character, incidental to and aiding commerce, and not affecting navigation elsewhere. The cases
fall into four fairly well-defined classes: (1), the regulation of pilotage, Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How.
299; (2), protection of coasts and improvement of harbors, bays, and streams, Mobile County v. Kimball, 102
U. S. 691; (3), quarantine and inspection laws and the
policing of harbors, Morgan's S. S. Co. v. Louisiana Board

obstructions over navigable waters entirely within the
boundaries of a single State.
The principle to be extracted from these cases is that
where the obstruction or restriction of navigability is
that of a state navigable water, the compact does not

apply; where it is of. an interstate navigable water such
as the Ohio River or the Great Lakes, the compact is, and
has always been in force.
The subject of the levels of and diversion of waters
from the Great Lakes is necessarily national because
international in character, and therefore for the exclusive
control of Congress. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar

By the Acts of 1890 and 1899 Congress made an effectual assertion of its paramount control over all navigable
waters of the United States and assumed jurisdiction of

The effect of § 10 of the Act of 1899 is to make the creation of such obstructions or modifications dependent
"upon the concurrent or joint assent of both the national
government and the state government." Cummings v.

Under § 10 of the Act of 1899, an act of Congress is
necessary to authorize the creation of an obstruction to
the navigable capacity of a navigable water of the
United States; for a modification of the condition, etc.,
of such navigable water, not amounting to an obstruction, the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers and
the authorization of the Secretary of War are necessary.

IV. Appellant has created and is maintaining an obstruction to the navigable capacity of navigable waters
of the United States in violation of § 10 of the Act of
Congress of March 3, 1899.
To constitute an obstruction, neither material injury
and damage to commerce nor unreasonable obstruction
to navigation are necessary. Economy 'Light Co. v.
United States, 256 U. S. 113; United States v. ChandlerDunbar Co., 229 U. S. 53; Pennsylvania v. Wheeling

v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46; Mississippi, etc. R. R. Co. v.
Ward, 2 Black, 485.
V. The obstructions have never been affirmatively authorized by Congress, as required by § 10 of the Act of
March 3, 1899.
The authority in the Acts of March 30, 1822, and
March 2, 1827, was for the construction of a particular
canal, the location of which was to be determined by law,
and for the purpose of navigation, not sanitation.
Sections 7 and 10 of the Act of September 19, 1890, and
§ 10 of the Act of March. 3, 1899, made unlawful any
greater diversion than was practiced in 1890. United
States v. Rio Grande Co., 174 U. S. 690.
The Niagara Falls Act of 1906 did not constitute such
authorization; if anything, it forbade the unauthorized
diversion.
The Canadian Boundary Waters Treaty of January
11, 1909, did not constitute such authorization; instead,
it forbade any diversion over 4,167 cubic seconds feet.
VI. Appellant's diversion in excess of 4,167 cubic seconds feet has not been recommended by the Chief of
Engineers nor authorized by the Secretary of War, as
required by § 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899.
Appellant, having applied for and accepted the various permits, is estopped.

The Secretary of War may impose conditions on permits granted by him under § 10 of the Act of March 3,
1899, and may revoke or modify such permits on nonfulfillment of these conditions. Southern Pac. Co. v.
Olympian Co., 260 U. S. 205.
VII. Appellant's unauthorized diversion cannot be
justified as an exercise of the police power.
On a subject of interstate commerce national in
character and requiring exclusive control by Congress,
there can be no reserved police power in the State to invade that control even for the protection of public health.
Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259; Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. Kaw Valley District, 233 U. S. 75.
On all other subjects of interstate commerce, when
Congress has asserted its paramount control, there is no
police power reserved in the State to invade it. Morgan's S. S. Co. v. Louisiana floard of Health, 118 U. S.

VIII. The right of appellee to an injunction is not
barred by laches, acquiescence, or estoppel.
Section 12 of the Act of March 3, 1899, is sufficient
authority for this suit. Economy Light Co. v. United
States, 256 Fed. 792, 793; s. c. 256 U. S. 113.
Congress intended by the Act of March 3, 1899, to
extend, not to limit, the scope of federal control over
obstructions and modifications of the navigable capacity
of navigable waters.
In the Act of 1890, § 10 provided that injunction proceedings might be instituted to enjoin obstructions. Section 12 of the Act of 1899 was intended to have a broader
scope and to cover all structures in violation of §§ 9, 10,
11, whether the structures amounted to, or caused, obstructions, or were merely unlawful modifications of the

condition of a navigable water, not amounting to obstructions.

the instant suit. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564; Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 13 How. 518; IUnited

Under the terms of the Treaty of January 11, 1909, the
construction of such compensating works as the appellant
proposes cannot be undertaken without the approval of
the International Joint Commission.
The decree which appellant proposes would be void and
inoperative, in that it would contain a condition which
the Court would be powerless to enforce. The construction of submerged weirs in the Niagara and St. Clair
Rivers may never be authorized by Congress. Even if so
authorized, they may never be permitted by the International Joint Commission. If authorized, they may cost
many times what the appellant has in mind or is able to
pay. Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. Kaw Valley District,

This is a bill in equity brought by the United States to
enjoin the Sanitary District of Chicago, a corporation of
Illinois, from diverting water from Lake Michigan in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute; the withdrawal of
that amount having been authorized by the Secretary of
War. It is alleged that the withdrawal of more, viz.,
from 400,000 to 600,000 cubic feet per minute, has lowered and will lower the level of the water of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Sault Ste. Marie, St. Mary's River, St. Clair River,
Detroit River, Niagara River, St. Lawrence River, and
all the harbors, &c., connected therewith, all of which
are alleged to be navigable waters of the United States,
and will thus create an obstruction to the navigable capacity of said waters; and that it will alter and modify
the condition and capacity of the above named and their
ports, &c., connected with them. The prohibition of
such alterations and obstructions in the Act of March 3,

266 U. S.

1899, c. 425, § 10; 30 Stat. 1121, 1151, is set out at length
aid relied upon but the frame of the bill does not exclude a, reliance upon more general principles if they
were needed in order to maintain it.
The withdrawal practised and threatened is through
an artificial channel that takes the place of the Chicago
River, formerly a little stream flowing into Lake Michigan, and of a part of its branches. The channel instead
of adding water to the Lake has been given an opposite
incline, takes its waters from the Lake, flows into the Desplaines River, which empties into the Illinois River,
which in its turn empties into the Mississippi. The
channel is at least twenty-five feet deep and at least one
hundred and sixty-two feet wide; and while its interest
to the defendant is primarily as a means to dispose of
the sewage of Chicago, Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496,
it has been an object of attention to the United States
as opening water communication between the Great
Lakes and the Mississippi and the Gulf.
The answer shows that the defendant is proceeding
under a state act of May 29, 1889, by which it was provided that a channel should be made of size sufficient to
take care of the sewage and drainage of Chicago as the
increase of population might require, with a capacity to
maintain an ultimate flow of not less than 600,000 cubic
feet of water per minute, and a continuous flow of not
less than 20,000 cubic feet for each 100,000 of the population within the sanitary district. It denies that the
defendant has abstracted from 400,000 to 600,000 feet
per minute, but as it alleges the great evils that would
ensue if the flow were limited to the amount fixed by the
Secretary of War or to any amount materially less than
that required by the state act of May 29, 1889, and. as it
admits present conditions to be good, the denial cannot
be taken very seriously. The act sufficiently indicates
what the State threatens and intends to do unless

SANITARY DISTRICT v. UNITED STATES.
405

425

Opinion of the Court.

stopped. The answer also denies that the abstraction
of water substantially in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per
minute will lower the levels of the Lakes and Rivers
concerned or create an obstruction to the navigable capacity of those waters. It goes into the details of the
construction of the channel; the expenses incurred; and
the impoitance of it to the health of the inhabitants of
Chicago, both for the removal of their sewage and avoiding the infection of their source of drinking water in
Lake Michigan which had been a serious evil before. It
shows the value of the channel for the great scheme of
navigation that we have mentioned; recites acts of Congress and of officers of the United States alleged to
authorize what has been done, and to estop the United
States from its present course, and finally takes the bull
by the horns and denies the right of the United States to
determine the amount of water that should flow through
the channel or the manner of the flow.
This brief summary of the pleadings is enough to show
the gravity and importance of the case. It concerns the
expenditure of great sums and the welfare of millions of
men. But cost and importance, while they add to the
solemnity of our duty, do not increase the difficulty of
decision except as they induce argument upon matters
that with less mighty interests no one would venture to
dispute. The law is clear, and when it is known the
material facts are few.
This is not a controversy between equals. The United
States is asserting its sovereign power to regulate commerce and to control the navigable waters within its jurisdiction. It has a standing in this suit not only to remove
obstruction to interstate and foreign commerce, the main
ground, which we will deal with last, but also to carry
out treaty obligations to a foreign power bordering upon
some of the Lakes concerned, and, it may be, also on the
footing of an ultimate sovereign interest in the Lakes.

266 U. S.

The Attorney General by virtue of his office may bring
this proceeding and no statute is necessary to authorize
the suit. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U. S.
273. With regard to the second ground, the Treaty of
January 11, 1909, with Great Britain, expressly provides
against uses 'affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters' without the authority of the United States or
the Dominion of Canada within their respective jurisdictions and the approval of the International Joint Commission agreed upon therein. As to its ultimate interest
in the Lakes the reasons seem to be stronger than those
that have established a similar standing for a State, as
the interests of the nation are more important than those
of any State. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 584, 585, 599.
Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230. Hudson
County Water Co. v. McCarter,209 U. S. 349, 355. Marshall Dental Manufacturing Co. v. Iowa, 226 U. S. 460,
462.
The main ground is the authority of the United States
to remove obstructions to interstate and foreign commerce. There is no question that this power is superior
to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants. In matters where the States
may act the action of Congress overrides what they have
done. Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U.
S. 177. Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S.
1, 53. But in matters where the national importance is
imminent and direct even where Congress has been silent
the States may not act at all. Kansas City Southern Ry.
Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District, 233 U. S. 75, 79.
Evidence is sufficient, if evidence is necessary, to show
that a withdrawal of water on the scale directed by the
statute of Illinois threatens and will affect the level of
the Lakes, and that is a matter which cannot be done
without the consent of the United States, even were
there no international covenant in the case.

SANITARY DISTRICT v. UNITEdD STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

But the defendant says that the United States has
given its assent to all that has been done and that it is
estopped to take the position that it now takes. A
State cannot estop itself by grant or contract from the
exercise of the police power. Texas & New Orleans R. R.
Co.v. Miller, 221 U. S.408, 414. Atlantic Coast Line R.
R. Co.v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 558. Denver & Rio
Grande R. R. Co. v. Denver, 250 U. S; 241, 244. It
would seem a strong thing to say that the United States
is subject to narrower restrictions in matters of national
and international concern. At least it is true that no such
result would be reached if a strict construction of the
Government's act would avoid it. This statement was
made and illustrated in a case where it was held that an
order of the Secretary of War under the Act of March 3,
1899, c. 425, the same'act in question here, directing an
alteration in a bridge must be obeyed, and obeyed without compensation, although the bridge had been built in
strict accord with an act of Congress declaring that if so
built it should be a lawful structure. Louisville Bridge
Co. v. United States, 242 U. S.409, 417. Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison,237 U. S. 251. It only remains to consider what the United States has done. And
it will be as well to bear in mind when considering it that
this suit is not for the purpose of doing away with the
channel, which the United States, we have no doubt,
would be most unwilling to see closed, but solely for the
purpose of limiting the amount of water to be taken
through it from Lake Michigan.
The defendant in the first place refers to two acts of
Congress: one of March 30, 1822, 3 Stat. 659, which became ineffectual because its conditions were not complied
with, and another of March 2, 1827, c. 51, 4 Stat. 234,
referred to, whether hastily or not, in Missouri v. Illinois,
200 U. S.496, 526, as an act in pursuance of which Illinois
brought Chicago into the Mississippi watershed. The

266 U. S.

act granted land to Illinois in aid of a canal to be opened
by the State for the purpose of uniting the waters of the
Illinois River with those of Lake Michigan, but if it has
any bearing on the present case it certainly vested no
irrevocable discretion in the State with regard to the
amount of water to be withdrawn from the Lake. It said
nothing on that subject. We repeat that we assume that
the United States desires to see the canal maintained and
therefore pass by as immaterial all evidence of its having
fostered the work. Even if it had approved the very size
and shape of the channel by act of Congress it would not
have compromised its right to control the amount of
water to be drawn from Lake Michigan. It seems that
a less amount than now passes through the canal would
suffice for the connection which the United States has
wished to establish and maintain.
In an appropriation Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425, § 10;
30 Stat. 1121, 1151; Congress provided "That the creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by
Congress, to the navigable capacity of any of the waters
of the United States is hereby prohibited; . . . and
it shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner
to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or
capacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal,
lake, harbor of refuge, or inclosure within the limits of
any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water
of the United -States, unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the
Secretary of War prior to beginning the same." By § 12
violation of the law is made a misdemeanor and punished, and the removal of prohibited structures may be
enforced by injunction of the proper Court of the United
States in a suit under the direction of the Attorney General. This statute repeatedly has been held to be constitutional in respect of the power given to the Secretary of
War. Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S.

409, 424. It is a broad expressioni of policy in unmistakable terms, advancing upon an earlier Act of September
19, 1890, c. 907, § 10; 26 Stat. 426, 454, which forbade obstruction to navigable capacity "not affirmatively authorized by law," and which had been held satisfied with regard to a boom across a river by authority from a State.
United States v. Bellingham Bay Boom Co., 176 U. S. 211.
There is neither reason nor opportunity for a construction
that would not cover the present case. As now applied it
concerns a change in the condition of the Lakes and the
Chicago River, admitted to be navigable, and, if that be
necessary, an obstruction to their navigable capacity,
United States v. Rio Grande Dam & IrrigationCo., 174
U. S. 690, without regard to remote questions of policy.
It is applied prospectively to the water henceforth to be
withdrawn. This withdrawal is prohibited by Congress,
except so far as it may be authorized by the Secretary
of War.
After this statute was passed the Secretary of War
granted various permits, which are relied on by the appellant although in their nature they all were revocable licenses. On May 8, 1899, the Secretary, on application of
the appellant, granted permission to open the channel, assumed in the recitals to have a flowage capacity of 300,000
cubic feet per minute with a velocity of one and onequarter miles an hour, on the conditions that the permit
should be subject to the action of Congress (which was
superfluous except as a warning); that if at any time the
current created proved to be unreasonably .obstructive to
navigation or injurious to property he reserved the right
to close or modify the discharge; and that the Sanitary
District must assume all responsibility for damages to
property and navigation interests by reason of the introduction of a current in Chicago River. On July 11, 1900,
improvements of the Chicago River were permitted with
the statement that the permission did not affect the

266 U. S.

right of the Secretary -to revoke the permit of May 8,
1899. On April 9, 1901, the Secretary, Mr. Root, directed
the Sanitary District to cut down the discharge to 200,000
cubic feet per minute. On July 23, 1901, at the appellant's request, he amended the order to permit a flow of
300,000 feet between 4 p. m. and twelve, midnight, subject to revocation. On December 5, 1901, again on the
application of the appellant, leave was given to discharge
not exceeding 250,000 feet per minute during the whole
twenty-four hours, but subject to such modification as
the Secretary might think that the public interests required. On January 17, 1903, the allowance was increased
to 350,000 feet until March 31, 1903, after which date it
was to be reduced again to 250,000 feet all subject to modification as before. On September 11, 1907,
and on June 30, 1910, permissions were granted to
make another connection with Lake Michigan and to
open a channel through Calumet River (this last refused
by Mr. Secretary Taft on March 14, 1907) on the understanding that the total quantity of water withdrawn from
the Lake should not exceed that already authorized by
the Secretary of War. Finally on February 5, 1912, the
appellant, setting forth that the population of the Sanitary District exceeded 2,500,000 and was increasing rapidly, and that the only method then available for disposing of the sewage of this population was by diluting
it with water flowing from Lake Michigan through the
canal, asked permission to withdraw not exceeding 10,000
cubic feet per second, subject to such restrictions and
supervision as might seem proper to the Secretary and
to revocation by him. On January 8, 1913, Mr. Secretary
Stimson carefully reviewed the situation, including the
obvious fact that so large a withdrawal would lower the
levels of the Lakes and the overwhelming evidence that
it would affect navigation, and held that he was not warranted in excepting the appellant from the prohibition of

Opinion of the Court.

Congress on the ground of even pressing sanitary needs.
It appears to us that the attempt to found a defence upon
the foregoing licenses is too futile to need reply.
States bordering on the Mississippi allowed to file
briefs as amici curiae suggest that they were not heard
and that rights have not been represented before the
Secretary of War. The City of Chicago makes a similar
complaint and argues that it is threatened with the loss
of a hundred million dollars. The interest that the River
States have in increasing the artificial flow from Lake
Michigan is not a right, but merely a consideration that
they may address to Congress, if they see fit, to induce
a modification of the law that now forbids that increase
unless approved as prescribed. The investment of property in the canal and the accompanying works took the
risk that Congress might render it valueloss by the exercise of paramount powers. It took the risk without even
taking the precaution of making it as sure as possible
what Congress might do. But we repeat that the Secretary by his action took no rights of any kind. He simply
refused an application of the Sanitary Board to remove
a prohibition that Congress imposed. It is doubtful at
least whether the Secretary was authorized to consider
the remote interests of the Mississippi States or the sanitary needs of Chicago. All interests seem in fact to have
been* copiously represented but he certainly was not
bound to give them a hearing upon the application upon
which he was requested to pass.
After the refusal, in January, 1913, to allow an increase
of flow, the appellant was notified by direction of the War
Department that it was drawing more water than was
allowed and was violating § 10 of the Act of March 3,
1899. In reply it intimated that it was bound by the
state law to which we have referred and in obedience to
it had been flowing 20,000 cubic feet per minute for each

100,000 of population and could not reduce that flow.
It suggested that its rights should be determined by a
suit, and accordingly this bill was filed on October 6, 1913.
An earlier suit had been brought on March 23, 1908, to
prevent the construction of a second channel from Lake
Michigan through the Calumet River to the appellant's
main channel, leave to do which had been refused as we
have seen by Mr. Secretary Taft. (The permit subsequently granted on June 30, 1910, was with the understanding that it should not affect or be used in the
'friendly suit' then pending to determine rights.) The
earlier suit was consolidated with the later present one,
and it was agreed that the evidence taken in that should
be used in this, so far as applicable. There was some
delay in concluding the case, which the defendant naturally would desire, but after it was submitted to the Judge
according to his own statement he kept it about six years
before delivering an oral opinion in favor of the Government on June 19, 1920. No valid excuse was offered for
the delay. There was a motion for reconsideration, but
the Judge took no further action of any kind until he
resigned in 1922. On June iS, 1923, another Judge
entered a decree for an injunction as prayed, with a stay
of six months to enable the defendant to present the
record to this Court.
The parties have come to this Court for the law, and
we have no doubt that as the law stands the injunction
prayed for must be granted. As we have indicated, a
large part of the evidence is irrelevant and immaterial to
the issues that we have to decide. Probably the dangers
to which the City of Chicago will be subjected if the
decree is carried out are exaggerated, but in any event
we are not at liberty to consider them here as against the
edict of a paramount power. The decree for an injunction as prayed is affirmed, to go into effect in sixty days-without prejudice to any permit that may be issued by
the Secretary of War according to law.
Affirmed.
