BEDDING CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

UNITED STATES BEDDING COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 143.

Argued December 11, 1924.-Decided January 5, 1925.

Plaintiff, alleging that it had retained possession of its goods because
of a circular of the War Industries Board requisitioning all such
goods for the Government, followed by abortive negotiations as
to price and by incipient proceedings to "commandeer" which
were abandoned because of the Armistice, and that it had sold
them thereafter for less than their previous market value, sued in
the Court of Claims for the difference. Held, that the suit could
not be maintained,(a) Under the Dent Act, since the agreement, if any, had not
been "performed in whole or in part," nor had "expenditures
been made or obligations incurred upon the faith of the same,"

(P. 493,)
(b) Nor as upon an express contract under the Tucker Act, because
the transaction was wholly executcry and was not "reduced to
writing and signed by the contracting parties with their names at
the end thereof," as required by Rev. Stats., § 3744, (Id.,)
(c) Nor as upon an implied contract under the Tucker Act, because
the only authority to requisition the goods was § 10 of the Lever
Act, and proceedings under that section are not based on contract
and must be brought in the District Court. Id.
58 Ct. Clms. 341, affirmed.

failure to state a cause of action. It alleges in substance
these facts: Cotton linters are used in the manufacture
of mattresses and bedding. They are also used as the
base of smokeless powder. The plaintiff had in stock, on
May 27, 1918, a lot of cotton inters. On that day, the
War Industries Board:' issued a circular "To dealers in
and users of cotton linters" notifying them for their
"information and guidance" that, because of the Government's requirements; all linters were requisitioned. On
July 10, 1918, it issued a further circular on the subject.
Later, the Board had direct dealing with the plaintiff
about taking over its linters at their actual value. A
price was offered which the plaintiff refused to accept.
The "Ordnance Department then began exercising the
right to commandeer by which the owner was to be given
an opportunity to establish the actual value of the inters
but before this commandeering process was completed
the Armistice was signed and the Government did not
then take the linters." Because of the Government's action, plaintiff had retained the inters. Because of the
release by the Government after the Armistice of all
linters held under such orders and regulations, the plaintiff's stock became worth less than it had cost the plaintiff
and less than its market value had been during the preceding summer. The resulting loss was $11,744.18.
Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to recover the
amount of this loss. The suit must have been brought
under the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272,
or under the Tucker Act, Judicial Code, § 145, upon the
ground that there was either an express executory contract to accept and pay the war value or that what occurred was a legal taking from which an implied agree'Itwas created by the Council of National Defense, with the approval of the President, July 28, 1917.

ment to pay arose, under the doctrine of United States
v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., 112 U. S. 645, and
later cases. We need not discuss the precise facts alleged
in the petition.' Whatever interpretation be given to
the action of the War Industries Board and the Ordnance
Department there set forth, the plaintiff must fail.
Recovery can not be had under the Dent Act, among
other reasons, because the agreement, if any, has not been
"performed in whole or in part" and no "expenditures
have been made or obligations incurred upon the faith
of the same. Compare PriceFire & Water Proofing Co.
v. United States, 261 U. S. 179. Nor is recovery possible
under the Tucker Act. It cannot be had as upon an express contract, because the transaction comes within Rev.
Stats., § 3744; was not "reduced to writing, and signed
by the contracting parties with their names at the end
thereof;" and was wholly executory. South Boston Iron
Co. v. United States, 118 U. S. 37; Erie Coal & Coke
Corporationv. United States, decided this day, post, 518.
Compare United States v. Andrews & Co., 207 U. S. 229,
243; St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United'States, 191
U. S. 159. Recovery cannot be had as upon an implied
contract, because the only authority to requisition the
linters was that conferred by § 10 of the Lever Act
(August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279); and proceedings under that section are not based on contract. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 299,
304. Moreover, they must be brought in the District
Court. United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U. S. 547.
We have no occasion, therefore, to consider whether
the United States could ever be liable under the Tucker

owner had retained possession of the property and the
