is a question as to which the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke our judgment. Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17,
22. If the case stood here as it stood before the court of
first instance it would present a grave question of constitutional law and we should be astute to avoid hindrances in the way of taking it up. But that is not the
situation. The rule promulgated by the Democratic Executive Committee was for a single election only that had
taken place long before the decision of the Appellate
Court. No constitutional rights of the plaintiffs in error
were infringed by holding that the cause of action had
ceased to exist. The bill was for an injunction that could
not be granted at that time. There was no constitutional
obligation to extend the remedy beyond what was prayed.

ARNDSTEIN.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 404, October Term, 1922. Petition for rehearing granted October
15, 1923; reargued November 27, 1923.-Decided October 20,
1924.
1. The right to examine the bankrupt in a bankruptcy proceeding,
for the purpose of obtaining possession of property belonging to his
estate, rests wholly upon ยง 21a of the Bankruptcy Act. P. 39.
2. That section, prescribing no rules for the examination, impliedly
adopts the general rules governing admissibility of evidence and
competency and compellabiity of witnesses; it indicates no intention to take from any witness the privilege against self-incrimination, and makes clear the purpose not to differentiate between the
bankrupt and other witnesses, nor between examinations relating to
property from those relating to his acts or conduct. Id.

civil proceedings; and, in this country, whatever the rule in Eng-

land, it may, in the absence of any statute affording him complete
immunity, be asserted by a bankrupt when being examined concerning his estate under ยง 21a of the Bankruptcy Act. Pp.
40,42.
4. Decisions requiring bankrupts to surrender books and papers
though containing incriminating evidence, rest on the substantive
obligation of bankrupts to surrender them as property; the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination relates to the adjective law. P. 41.
Judgment reaffirmed.
APPFAL from a judgment of the District Court in
habeas corpus, discharging Arndstein from custody under
a commitment for contempt based on his refusal to answer
questions propounded on his examination as a bankrupt.
The judgment was affirmed in McCarthy v. Arndstein,
262 U. S. 355. The present decision is upon a rehearing.
Mr. Selden Bacon for the National Surety Company.
At the common law, the privilege not to answer on the
ground that the answer would tend to incriminate the
witness did not extend to permitting a bankrupt to refuse
to discover his estate and effects or the particulars relating to them, even though that information might tend to
incriminate him. Ex parte Cossens, Buck's Cases, 531;

The Fifth Amendment protects a witness from testifying

The possible federal prosecution suggested is one under
the Bankruptcy Act for concealing assets. A rule that
bankrupts may refuse to disclose their concealed assets
because it is a crime to conceal them would encourage and
assist concealments. Johnson v. United States, 163 Fed.

In any case where the requirement that the bankrupt
answer is or may have been based on a ruling that the
claim of constitutional exemption is not made in good
faith, the question of the propriety of that ruling cannot
be raised on habeas corpus, but is peculiarly a subject
for review on appeal.
Where a claim of error in the decision on a question of
fact enters into the application for discharge, the commitment cannot be reviewed on habeas corpus. And the
petitioner for the writ has the burden of showing affirmatively that no such decision on the facts was involved.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In 1920, Arndstein was adjudged an involuntary bankrupt in the Southern District of New York. Pursuant to
a subpoena, he appeared before a special commissioner for
examination as to his assets under ยง 21a of the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 552, as
amended; was sworn as a witness; and freely answered
some questions. Others he refused to answer on the
ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him. Having persisted in this refusal, after the District Judge
ordered him to answer, Arndstein was committed for contempt. He did not appeal from the order or file a petition to revise. Instead, he applied to another judge sitting in the same court for a writ of habeas corpus. The
petition was denied on the ground that the bankrupt had

McCARTHY v. ARNDSTEIN.
Opinion of the Court.

34

waived his privilege by complying without objection to
the order that he file a schedule of his assets.' The judgment denying the writ was reversed by this Court; but
the mandate required merely that the lower court issue the
writ and then proceed as usual. Arndstein v. McCarthy,
254 U. S. 71 and 379.
Thereupon, the District Court issued the writ of habeas
corpus. The marshal made a return which included a
transcript of the entire proceedings. The court held that,
despite certain oral answers given, the bankrupt was entitled to cease disclosure. The judgment, which discharged the bankrupt from custody, was affirmed by this
Court. McCarthy v. Arndstei,, 262 U. S. 355, 357-8.
The case is now before us on rehearing, granted in order
to permit argument of the proposition, not presented by
counsel before, that the privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to an examination of the bankrupt
made for the purpose of obtaining possession of property
belonging to his estate. 263 U. S. 676.
The right to examine the bankrupt, here in question,
rests wholly on ยง 21a. This section provides that the court
may "require any designated person, including the bankrupt and his wife, to appear in court .
.
to be examined concerning the acts, conduct, or properfy of a
bankrupt whose estate is in process of administration.
The subject matter of the examination is thus
specifically prescribed by the act. There is no provision
prescribing the rules by which the examination is to be
governed. These are, impliedly, the general rules governing the admissibility of evidence and the competency and
compellability of witnesses. 2 The section contains no in."

dication of an intelition, on the part of Congress, to take
from any witness the privilege against self-incrimination.
Moreover, the section makes clear the purpose not to differentiate between the bankrupt and other witnesses, nor
to differentiate examinations which relate to the property
from those which relate to the acts or the conduct of the
bankrupt.' This Court has already decided that the privilege was not waived either by the bankrupt's filing the
schedule or by his answering orally certain questions. The
contention now is that the privilege against self-incrimination ought to have been disallowed because, under the
Constitution, it does not extend to the examination of a
bankrupt in a bankruptcy proceeding.
The Government insists, broadly, that the constitutional
privilege against self-incrimination does not apply in any
civil proceeding. The contrary must be accepted as
settled. The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon
the nature of the proceeding in which the testimony is
sought or is to be used. It applies alike to civil and
criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to
subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The
privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one
who is also a party defendant. It protects, likewise, the
owner'of goods which may be forfeited in a penal proceeding. See Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 563-4.
'Substantially the same provision was made in the Act of April 4,
1800, c. 19, ยงยง 14, 18, 24, 2 Stat. 25, 26, 28; in the Act of August 19,
1841, c. 9, ยง 4, 5 Stat. 440 (in part); Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176,
ยง 26, 14 Stat. 517, 529. See also Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487,
ยง 7, 32 Stat. 797, 798. The purpose may have been, in part, to render
the bankrupt and others competent as witnesses. Compare Ex parte
Haes, [1902] 1 K. B. 98. The bankrupt (and many other witnesses)
would, under the rules prevailing in the common law court at the time
the earlier bankrupt laws were enacted, have been incompetent as
witnesses, on the ground of interest, but for such a provision; and
the wife would have been incompetent because of her particular
relationship,

McCARTHY v. ARNDSTEIN.

Opinion of the Court.

The Government urges more strongly a narrower contention. It claims that the constitutional privilege does
not relieve a bankrupt from the duty to give information
which is sought for the purpose of discovering his estate.
It asserts that in England such an exception to the common law privilege prevails, and that the exception had
been established there prior to the Declaration of Independence.4 Whatever may be the rule in England, it is
clear that in America the constitutional prohibition of
compulsory self-incrimination has not been so limited.'
The cases which hold that a bankrupt must surrender
books and papers, although they contain incriminating
evidence, rest upon a principle different from that here
involved. Matter of Harris, 221 U. S. 274; Johnson v.
United States, 228 U. S. 457; Ex parte Fuller, 262 U. S.
91; Dier v. Banton, 262 U. S. 147. The law requires a
bankrupt to surrender his property. The books and
papers of a business are'a part of the bankrupt estate.
ยง 70 a(1). To permit him to retain possession, because
surrender might involve disclosure of a crime, would destroy a property right. The constitutional privilege relates to the adjective law. It does not relieve one from
compliance with the substantive obligation to surrender
property.

See Ex parte Meymot, 1 Atk. 196, 198, 200; Bx parte Cossens,

Buck's Cases, 531, 540; In re Heath, 2 D. & Ch. 214. The requirement under the English practice referred to is, perhaps, more like
the American requirement of the Miing of a schedule of assets under
ยง 7a(8), than the submission to examination as a witness provided

Section 21a, on the other hand, deals specifically and
solely with the adjective law-with evidence and witnesses. When the bankrupt appears before a commissioner under this section, he comes, like any other person,
merely to testify. In that connection he may, like any
other witness, assert the constitutional privilege; because
the present statute fails to afford complete immunity
from a prosecution. If Congress should hereafter conclude that a full disclosure of the bankrupt estate by the
witnesses is of greater importance than the possibility of
punishing them for some crime in the past, it can, as in
other cases, confer the power of unrestricted examination
by providing complete immunity. Compare Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591; Glickstein v. United States, 222
