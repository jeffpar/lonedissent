Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

Mr. Harry Brokaw, by leave of court, filed a brief on
behalf of the City of East Liverpool, Ohio, as amicus
curiae, in No. 26.
MR. JusTIcE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases were argued together. They present on
substantially similar facts the question whether interurban electric railroads engaged in interstate commerce are
subject generally to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Each case is a direct appeal, under the Act of October
22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, from a final decree of
the federal court for northern Ohio setting aside an order
of the Commission. In each the plaintiff below was an
Ohio municipality, and the carrier, who intervened as
defendant, an independent interurban electric railroad.
The carriers operate lines within and between Ohio
municipalities, and also between these and a city in an
adjoining State. The orders require the carriers to raise
intrastate interurban passenger fares which, as the Commission found, subject interstate commerce to unj'ust
discrimination. Fares within the Ohio municipalities are
not affected. Ohio Rates, Fares, and Charges, 64 I. C. C.
493; Ohio and Pennsylvania Rates, Fares, and Charges,
64 I. C. C. 517.
The Commission granted the relief under the rule of
The Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342, and Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
R. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563. The District Court held the
orders void, on the ground that the jurisdiction conferred
by Congress upon the Commission did not extend to interurban electric railroads of the character of those here
involved; that its jurisdiction was limited to those which
are operated as part of a general steam railroad system,

or which, if operated independently, are engaged in the
general transportation of freight, in addition to their passenger and express business; and that these carriers possessed neither of " these dominating characteristics."
Village of Hubbard, Ohio, v. United States, 278 Fed. 754;
City of Wellsville, Ohio, v. United States, 278 Fed. 769.
We have no occasion to enquire into the correctness of
the latter ruling, as we are of opinion that the Commission's jurisdiction to prevent unjust discrimination by
interurban electric railroads against interstate commerce
is not so limited."
In 1897, the Commission assumed jurisdiction over the
passenger fares of an electric railroad which operated between the District of Columbia and a neighboring village
in Maryland. Willson v. Rock Creek Ry. Co., 7 I. C. C.
83. The development of interurban roads became general about 1902.2 The authority to regulate them has
been consistently exercised by the Commission in many
cases and for many purposes. Since 1915, interurban
electric roads have been required to file with it annual reports of their finances and operations.s Jirisdictionover
Urban Electric Lines, 33 I. C. C. 536. In exercising authority over their passenger fares, no distinction has been
made between those interurban roads which were engaged
in the general transportation of freight in addition to their

It was also contended that because the intrastate fares had been
fixed by contract between the municipalities and the carriers (Interurban Railway & Terminal Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 98
Oh. St. 287), Congress was without power to authorize an increase
of the fares. The unsoundness of this contention was settled in New
York v. United States, 257 U. S. 591.

On the other hand the distinction suggested in Omaha &
Council Bluffs Street Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce
Commission, 230 U. S. 324, 337, between interurban railroads and urban or suburban street railways has been
carefully observed.
Neither in the Act to Regulate Commerce, February
4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, nor in any amendments
thereto prior to that of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539,
552, is there any specific reference to electric railroads.
The basis for the jurisdiction of the Commission over
them, is the generality of the language of the original
act, which declared in ยง 1 that its provisions "shall apply
to any common carrier or carriers engaged in the transporby railroad."

1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415, Denver & InterurbanRy. Co.
v. United States, 236 Fed. 685, were applied to interurban electric railroads.
The correctness of the Commnission's action in assuming jurisdiction over the interurban roads is confirmed by
the action of Congress which, in recent amendments of
the Act to Regulate Commerce, limited, in respect to certain subjects, the authority over them. The Commission entertained, in 1908, applications of interurban electric railroads to establish for freight through routes and
joint rates with steam railroads.5 The Act of June 18,
1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 551, 552, provided that "the
commission shall not . . . establish any through
route, classification, or rate between street electric passenger railways not engaged in

freight in addition to their passenger and express business and railroads of a different character." 6 Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, enlarged, in several
respects, the powers of the Commission, and dealt also
in other ways with carriers engaged in interstate commerce. In doing so, it provided expressly in five sections
for the exclusion of certain electric railways from the

operation of the powers conferred; and it also differentiated interurban, electric railways from street and suburban railways by specific reference to each, although a
distinction in treatment was made in only one case.'
These provisions indicate that Congress did not intend to
deny to the Commission the power to regulate interurban railways in other respects.

The separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS.
In Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Ry. Co. v. Interstate
Commerce Commission, 230 U. S. 324, decided June 9,
1913, this Court pointed out the radical difference between
street railroads and common carriers by railroad and, for
the potent reasons indicated, held the latter were within

suburban electric railways unless operated as a part of a general
steam railroad system of transportation, (c) interurban electric railways unless operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of
transportation or engaged in the general transportation of freight"
etc. Section 402, amending ยง 1, which provides for the issuance of
certificates of public convenience and necessity in the case of construction, extension or abandonment of a line, excludes, by paragraph
22, p. 478, "street, suburban, [and] or interurban electric railways,
which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation." Section 439, which inserts the new
ยง 20a, concerning the issue of securities, excludes, by par. 1, p.
494, "a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway which is
not operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of transportation." Section 209, concerning the guaranty to carriers after
the termination of federal control, excludes, by par. a, p. 464, "a
street or interurban electric railway not under Federal control at the
time Federal control terminates, which has as its principal source
of operating revenue urban, suburban, or interurban passenger traffic or sale of power," etc. Section 300, which deals with the Labor
Board, excludes by par. 1, p. 469, "a street, interurban, or suburban
electric railway not operating as part of a general steam railroad
system of transportation."

the Interstate Commerce Act and the former were not.
The distinction is certainly a sound one and, I think, it
was rightly observed by the court below.
Since the opinion in 1913 Congress has given much
consideration to the Interstate Commerce Act, but nowhere do I find expression of a definite purpose to disregard the limitations there approved. The question is
highly important; the subject matter is essentially local
in nature; the States can and should control until and
unless Congress, by clear language, shall indicate its
intent to regulate. The creators ought not be deprived
of power over their own creatures as to domestic traffic
permitted only under carefully considered contracts, because of detached and obscure sentences found here and
there in a general enactment designed for carriers whose
lines constitute integral parts of the great interstate railway system of the, country.

indispensable party, and it cannot be sued without consent of
