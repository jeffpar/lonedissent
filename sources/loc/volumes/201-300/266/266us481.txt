Syllabus.

the Interstate Commerce Act and the former were not.
The distinction is certainly a sound one and, I think, it
was rightly observed by the court below.
Since the opinion in 1913 Congress has given much
consideration to the Interstate Commerce Act, but nowhere do I find expression of a definite purpose to disregard the limitations there approved. The question is
highly important; the subject matter is essentially local
in nature; the States can and should control until and
unless Congress, by clear language, shall indicate its
intent to regulate. The creators ought not be deprived
of power over their own creatures as to domestic traffic
permitted only under carefully considered contracts, because of detached and obscure sentences found here and
there in a general enactment designed for carriers whose
lines constitute integral parts of the great interstate railway system of the, country.

OF THE INTERIOR, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.

No. 112. Argued October 24, 1924.-Decided January 5, 1925.
1. A suit to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and other executive
officers from carrying out acts of Congress upon the ground that
they unconstitutionally deprive the plaintiff and the other members of an Indian tribe of property held 'for them as individuals
by the United States, can not be entertained in the face of a
substantial defense that the property is in truth tribal property
subject to control by the United States as guardian of Indians,
since for the adjudication of this issue the United States is an
indispensable party, and it cannot be sued without consent of
Congress. P. 485.
2. Under Act of January 14, 1889, and by agreement with the
Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, reservation land was ceded to

the United States, which undertook to sell it, deposit the proceeds in the Treasury to the credit of those Ind'ans, pay interest,
in specified ways, to them and on their behalf and ultimately
divide the principal among the Indians then entitled. Held, that
one of the Indians has no standing to maintain a class suit to
restrain executive officials from alleged excess of their powers
in disposing of the funds and interest, since the trust is the
obligation of the United States, and the right of the Indians is
merely to have the United States administer it properly. P. 486.

with the performance of the functions committed to an executive
department of the Government, by a suit to which the United
States is not, and cannot be made, a party. Id.

Court.

By the Act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642,
and agreements made pursuant thereto approved by the
President March 4, 1890, the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota ceded to the United States their title to all lands

constituting their reservations in that State, except a

small portion of the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations.' The ceded lands were to be surveyed and classified
into pine and agricultural lands, and were to be sold
at a price not less than that fixed by the act; the proceeds were to be deposited in the Treasury of the United
States to the credit of the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota; and interest thereon was to be paid by the Government at the rate of five per cent. Part of this interest
was to be distributed annually in cash to heads of families and guardians of minor orphans; part thereof to
other classes of Indians; and the remainder was to be
applied, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, for the establishment and maintenance of free
schools for the Indians. At the end of fifty years the
so-called permanent fund was to be divided in equal
shares and paid to the Indians then entitled thereto.
The United States has exercised and is now exercising, in
respect to the property dealt with in said act and agreement, the powers of a guardian for these Indians and of
a trustee in possession.
This suit was brought in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia by Morrison, who alleges that he
is a member of the class of persons described as "all the
Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota," and sues
on behalf of himself and others similarly situated. The
defendants are the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Treasury. Relief is sought on eight distinct grounds. Four of them

rest upon charges that by six later acts 2 Congress undertook to modify or to ignore rights of the Chippewas
which had become fixed by the agreements approved
March 4, 1890; that by carrying out the provisions of
these later acts the defendants, in their official capacities,
have subjected these Chippewas to geat kiss, and
threaten further injury; and that each of the six acts
is void, because it deprives them of property in violation
of the Constitution. Three grounds of complaint rest
upon charges that the defendants, acting officially, have,
through mistaken and hence unauthorized exercise of
powers granted by the Act of 1889, inflicted, and threaten,
further injury. The eighth ground of complaint is that
loss has been inflicted and is threatened through failure
to perform duties imposed by that act. The specific
prayers are for an injunction to restrain each of the
threatened wrongs. There is also a prayer for general
relief. The defendants moved to dismiss the bill. The
motions were sustained; and leave was granted to amend.
An amended bill was filed; defendants again moved to
dismiss; a final decree of dismissal was entered by the
trial court; and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals
of the District. 290 Fed. 306. The case is here on appeal under ยง 250 of the Judicial Code.
. The objections presented by the motions to dismiss include lack of jurisdiction of the court over the subject
matter; lack of necessary parties plaintiff and defendant;

'Another ground of complaint relating to action of the Government in recognizing the claim of Minnesota under the Swamp Land

of what is alleged to be a change in the policy of the Secretary of
the Interior as indicated by the commencement of a suit in this
Court.

and lack of merits. Every objection made involves the
determination of the nature of the title of the Indians
to the property in suit and the nature of the interest of
Morrison therein. The differences in character of the
three classes of complaint included in the bill require that
each class be considered separately. But it is not necessary either to state in detail the facts concerning each of
the eight grounds of complaint, or to pass upon their
merits.
First. The four grounds of complaint which rest upon
the charge that the defendants are depriving these Chippewas of their property by carrying out the provisions of
the six later acts of Congress, have this in common. Each
complaint relates to some change made either in the
method of managing and disposing of the ceded lands or
in the disposition of the proceeds thereof. As to each,
it is claimed that the defendants' acts are unlawful because Congress was powerless to make the change without
the consent of the Chippewas. It is admitted that, as
regards tribal property subject to the control of the
United States as guardian of Indians, Congress may make
such changes in the management and disposition as it
deems necessary to promote their welfare. The United
States is now exercising, under the claim that the property is tribal, the. powers of a guardian and of a trustee
in possession. Morrison's contention is that, by virtue of
the Act of 1889 and the agreements made thereunder, the
ceded lands ceased to be tribal property and the rights
of the Indians in the lands and in the fund to be formed
became fixed as individual property. The Court of Appeals held this contention to be unfounded. We have
no occasion to determine whether it erred in so ruling.
The.claim of the United States is, at least, a substantial
one. To interfere with its management and dispositioii
of the lands or the funds by enjoining its officials, would
interfere with the performance of governmental functions

and vitally affect interests of the United States. It is,
therefore, an indispensable party to this suit.' It was not
joined as defendant. Nor could it have been, as Congress has not consented that it be sued.' The bill, so far
as it complains of acts done pursuant to the later legislation, was properly dismissed for this reason, among others.
Second. The three grounds of complaint which rest
upon charges that the defendants, acting under color of
authority granted by the Act of 1889, have inflicted and
threaten injury by the exercise of powers not conferred,
have this in common. Each complaint involves the
charge that the officials have erred either in construing
or in applying that act and the agreements approved
March 4, 1890. The Court of Appeals held all of these
charges to be unfounded. We need not consider the correctness of the rulings. Nor need we consider whether
the errors complained of were decisions by a head of an
executive department of the Government of the character not subject to judicial review.' The bill was properly dismissed, so far as concerns these three charges,
because the plaintiff is not in a position to litigate in this
proceeding the legality of the acts complained of.
The case at bar is unlike those in which relief by injunction has been granted against the head of an executive department, or other officer, of the Government to
enjoin an official act on the ground that it was not within
the authority conferred, or that it was an improper exercise of such authority, or that Congress lacked the power
to confer the authority exercised. In those cases the act

complained of either involved an invasion or denial of a
definite right of the plaintiff,' or it operated to cast a
cloud upon his property.' In some of those cases the
defendant would have'been liable individually in trespass
unless he could justify under authority conferred.' Morrison and the other Chippewas have no right of that character. The lands ceded are the property of the United
States. It has, confessedly, power to dispose of them. It
assumed the obligation of doing this properly, of accounting for the principal of the trust fund to be created
thereby, and of disbursing properly the interest accruing.
Each of these three grounds of complaint involves, in
essence, either the charge of failure to pay into the Treasury to the credit of the Chippewas money which should
be credited to them or the making of a payment from the
accruing interest for a purpose not authorized. If through
officials of the United States these lands, or the proceeds

thereof, or the accruing interest, are improperly disposed
of, it is the United States, not the officials, which is under
obligation to account to the Indians therefor. In other
words, the right of the Indians is merely to have the
United States administer properly the trust assumed. It
resembles the general right of every citizen to have the
Government administered according to law and the public moneys properly applied." Courts have no 'power,
under the circumstances here presented, to interfere with
the performance of the functions committed to an executive department of the Government by a suit to which
the United States is not, and cannot be made, a party.1
Third. A mandatory injunction is sought to compel
the Secretary of the Interior to permit the Red Lake Indians to receive allotments from the Red Lake Reservation, under ยง 2 of the General Allotment Act of February
8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388. The plaintiff does not claim
to be entitled to an allotment of any of this land. He
is not a Red Lake Indian. He is not seeking to enforce
the right of any Red Lake Indian to an allotment. Morrison's interest is an indirect one. His complaint appears
to be this:
Approximately 700,000 acres of land were reserved to
satisfy claims for allotment to the Red Lake Indians.
Under the agreements approved by the President these
allotments were to be made as soon as practicable after

Among the 59 cases passed upon by this Court in which a suit
to enjoin an officer of the United States was entertained but relief
was denied, there are two-Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50,
and Lane v. Morrison, 246 U. S. 214-in which the plaintiff appears
to have had only the same character of interest as is claimed by the
plaintiff in the present case. In these cases, relief was denied on the
ground that the action complained of was. within the scope of the
authority conferred, the question of the plaintiff's right to litigate
the matter not having been raised.

Opinion of the Court.

the taking of a census. The amount of land which will
actually be required to satisfy these claims for allotment
is far less than the 700,000 acres reserved. The surplus
land, when ascertained, will pass to the United States as
a part of the ceded lands. This surplus, like the other
lands, must be sold; and, when sold, the proceeds must
be paid into the trust fund for the benefit of all the Chippewas in Minnesota. If, and as soon as, the trust fund is
augmented by the sale of the surplus lands, a part of the
interest accruing on the addition so made to the trust
fund will be payable to all the Chippewas in Minnesota,
including the plaintiff. The prescribed census was completed 32 years before the filing of the bill No allotments have been made. The delay in making the allotments has postponed the determination of what are surplus lands, and consequently the sale of the same. The
delay in making sales has postponed the payment into the
trust fun:d of the expected proceeds-from sales. The delay
in making this payment has deferred the accruing of interest. Thus the plaintiff and others are deprived of part of
their expected annual income. The delay in making the
allotment has likewise deferred the commencement of the
running of the fifty-year period upon the expiration of
which the trust fund is to be distributed. The postponement of the period of distribution results in unnecessary
and illegal expenditure out of the income of the fund.
It is to avert such indirect losses that a mandatory injunction is sought to compel the Secretary to make the
allotments.
Morrison urges that he is seeking to enforce the performance of a merely ministerial duty. Relief was
denied by the Court .of Appeals on the ground that he is
not a member of the Red Lake Band and has shown no
authority to speak for them. Whether that ruling was
correct, whether the duty of the Secretary of the Interior
is merely ministerial, and whether the indirect or remote

266 U. S.

interest of the plaintiff in the performance of the particular duty is of a nature which could, in any event, entitle
him to compel its specific performance by judicial
process--these are questions which we have no occasion
to consider. A mandatory injunction, like a mandamus,
is an extraordinary remedial process which is granted,
not as a matter of right but in the exercise of a sound
judicial discretion. 2 It issues to remedy a wrong, not to
promote one. No facts are shown which justify its issue
in this case. It is alleged that the Secretary of the Interior has "refused and still refuses to allot a single Indian on the Red Lake Reservation lands, or to permit
any Indian to select or receive an allotment thereon." If
any Indian who is entitled to an allotment has vainly
requested that it be made to him, it is not necessary to
seek redress indirectly by this proceeding. Under the Act
of February 6, 1901, c. 217, 31 Stat. 760, any Indian who
claims to be entitled to an allotment under any act of
Congress, may bring suit therefor against the United
States in the appropriate district court. 3 Moreover, the
course pursued by the Secretary of the Interior has been
long acquiesced in by the Red Lake Indians and for
aught that appears it is in accord with the desires and
interest not only of that Band, but also of all the other
Chippewas in Minnesota except the plaintiff.
