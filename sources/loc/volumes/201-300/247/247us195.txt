delivered the opinion of the court.

In January, 1900, the refpondent purchased 30,000
shares of stock of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway
Company for $981,427.92, and sold them January 28,
1909, for $1,795,719-a profit of over $814,000. It included no portion of this profit in its return for the year
1909 under tlie Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5,

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

247 U. S.

1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, ยง 38, and the United States
brought this suit to recover the tax of 1 per cent. thereon.
The District Court directed a verdict in favor of plaintiff.
Upon review the Circuit Court of Appeals held the proceeds of sale of the stock could not be considered as income under the act except to the extent by which they
exceeded the market value of the stock on December 31,
19.08, ascertained to be $57 per share. It therefore reversed the judgment, and remanded the case with instruction to enter a new judgment to include a tax on
this account only upon the balance of the selling price
above $57 per share or $1,710,000 in all. 242 Fed. Rep.
18. A writ of certiorari was then allowed.
For reasons sufficiently stated in Doyle v. Mitchell
Brothers Co., and Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co.,
ante, pp. 179, 189, we concur in the view that defendant
was not taxable except- with respect' to so much. of the
profit upon the stock as accrued after December 31, 1908.
Just how this part is to be separated from that which
previously accrued is a matter of some nicety, as we have
shown: in the Hays Case. -The Circuit Court of Appeals
adopted the theory of an inventory taken as of the time
the act went into effect; and although the assets here under consideration were not acquired for. the purpose of
sale in the manner of merchandise, but were bought for
iiivestment, and hence were not inventoried on December
31, 1908, it accepted the stipulated fact that the stock
had a regular market value of $57 per share on that date
as supplying the lack of an inventory. This result accords -with .the views we have expressed in the cases
referred to.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JusTicE Hoimms took no part in the consideration

or decision of this case.
