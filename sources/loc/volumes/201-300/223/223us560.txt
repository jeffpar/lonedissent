SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY v.
UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 121.

Argued January 26, 1912.-Decided February 26, 1912.

The Southern Pacific Railroad Company is not entitled under the
Branch Line Land Grant Act of March 3, 1871, c. 122, ยง 23, 16
Stat. 573, 579, to select as lieu lands within the indemnity limits
specified in that act, any lands within the granted or indemnity
limits of the grant made to Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company
by the act of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 292, c. 278, and forfeited by
that road under the act of July 6, 1886, 24 Stat. 123, c. 637. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 168 U. S. 1, followed, and
Ryan v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 382, distinguished.
152 Fed. Rep. 314, and 167 Fed. Rep. 574, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve rights of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company under its branch line grant to lands
within the overlap of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad
Company grant, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Maxwell Evarts for appellants:
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company under its
branch line grant of March 3, 1871, was entitled to select
the lands in question in lieu of lands lost within the place
limits of its grant.
A railroad is entitled to select indemnity lands from
any lands within the indemnity limits of its grant which
at the time of selection are public lands. In Ryan v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 382, it was decided that whereas the
rights of the company under such a grant in respect to
lands within primary limits depend upon the status of the
lands as public lands or otherwise at the date of the act,

SOUTHERN PAC. R. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES. 561

Argument for Appellants.

and the time of definite location, the right to lands within
indemnity limits does not depend upon the status of such
lands at the date of the granting act, but upon their status
as public lands or otherwise at the time of selection.
The question is: What is the land now when selection
is sought to be made? Is it now public land or not? If
it is now public land, then it is of no importance whatever
what parties in the past may have had claims or rights
thereto. See also Alabama & ChattanoogaR. R. Co., 20
L. D. 408; Southern Pacific R. R, Co., 26 L. D. 452.
The status of lands within indemnity limits at the time
of selection determines entirely the right of the railroad
thereto. Allers v. Northern Pacific R. R. Co., 9 L. D. 452;
Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Halvorson, 10 L. D. 15;
Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Beal, 10 L. D. 504; Northern
Pacific R. R. Co. v. Moling, 11 L. D. 138; Hensley v. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co., 12 L. D. 19; Northern Pacific
R. R. Co. v. Bass, 13 L. D. 201; Hastings & Dakota Ry.
Co. v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry. Co., 13 L. D. 535; St. Paul,
M. & M. R. Co. v. Munz, 17 L. D. 288;. South & North
Alabama R. R. Co. v. Hall, 22 L. D. 273; Southern Pacific
R. R. Co. v. McKinley, 22 L. D. 493.
The Ryan Case has since its decision always been referred to with approval by this court. The decisions of
the Interior Department since the Ryan Case have been
in accord therewith. It is inconceivable that the doctrine
of the Ryan Case, so important in land grant law and so
long established, should be overturned by a decision of
this court in Which there was no discussion of, or reference
to, the Ryan Case. The Southern Pacific Railroad is now
entitled to select from within the indemnity limits of its
branch line grant lands granted to the Atlantic and
Pacific Railroad which were restored to the public domain
by the Forfeiture Act of 1886, and were public lands of
the United States, at the date of selection by the Southern
Pacific and the issue of the patents therefor.
VOL. ccxxiiu--36

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Argument for the United States.

223 U. S.

There is no pretense on the part of the Government
that the railroad company is not entitled to indemnity
lands to take the place of losses within its primary limits.
The ground alleged for the cancellation of the patents
issued in this case is that this court has already decided
that the Southern Pacific Railroad Company is not entitled to any indemnity land under its branch line grant
within the limits of the forfeited Atlantic and Pacific grant,
and the whole discussion centers upon the decision in
Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 168 U. S.1.
The lands in controversy in this suit were not within
the limitg which were involved in the suit in 168 U. S. 1.
The cases in 146 U. S.570; 146 U. S. 615, and 168 U. S.
1, determined one thing and one thing only, to wit, that
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company took no place
lands under its grant of March 3, 1871, which were in conflict with the Atlantic and Pacific grant.
This court, in 183 U. S.519, was careful to point out
that the only lands involved in 168 U. S.1, were "granted"
or place lands.
In no decision of this court has it been held that the
Southern Pacific Railroad has not the right to select its
indemnity lands from the forfeited limits of the Atlantic
and Pacific grant.
No reason is suggested and never has been, suggested
or passed upon by this court as to why this particular
grant should be deemed an exception to the general rule.
This proposition has never been discussed or decided by
this court.
The Solicitor General for the United States:
The Southern Pacific is not-now entitled under the indemnity provisions of its branch line grant of March 3,
1871, ยง 23, to select lands which at the time of that grant'
and of the filing and acceptance of its map and the withdrawals in pursuance thereof were subject to either the

SOUTHERN ,PAC. R. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES. 563
223U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

primary or indemnity provisions of the Atlantic and Pacific
grant of July 27, 1866, but which subsequently, by the
act of July 6, 1886, were forfeited for breach of condition
by the Atlantic and Pacific and festored to the public domain.
The question is res judicata because of the decision of
this court in Southern Pacific Railroad Company v. United
States, 168 U. S. 1.
Still further confirmation is had by reference to another
case between the same parties: Southern Pacific Railroad
Co. v. United States, 189 U. S. 447, 451, 452, notwithstanding the 'case of Ryan v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 382.
The same situafion as in 168 U. S. 1, was before the
court in the cases of Uiiited States v. Southern Pacific
Railroad Co., 184 U. S. 49, 53, and Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 200 U. S. 341. Those cases in
effect constitute a reaffirmance of the 168 U. S. case.
The proviso in ยง 23 of the branch line grant renders it
quite unnecessary to consider here any distinction that
might be based on the fact that cases Nos. 128 and 129
(post, p. 565) are concerned only with Atlantic and Pacific
primary lands. See United States v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 146 U. S. 615. Moreover, the Forfeiture
Act of 1886 hits lands of the Atlantic and Pacific embraced
within both the granted and indemnity limits.
No question is presented by the presence of the other
parties, the mortgagees stand in the same rights as the
gouthern Pacific.
The defendant purchaser has not appealed. In any
event his joinder injects no other question into the case,
for his position as not being a bonafide purchaser is settled
by the case in 184 U. S. 49.

patents for lands lying within the indemnity limits of the
grant made to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
by the act of March 3, 1871, c. 122, ยง 23, 16 Stat. 573, 579,
known as the branch line grant, and within the grant made
to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company by the
act of July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 292. The Atlantic
and Pacific road forfeited its grant, (act of July 6, 1886,
c. 637, 24 Stat. 123), and thereafter the Southern Pacific
selected the two parcels in question, as indemnity under
its branch line grant, one of them lying within the granted,
and the other within the indemnity limits of the'Atlantic
and Pacific. It relies on the general principle that whether
lands are subject to selection as indemnity depends upon
the state of the lands at the time the selection is made.
Ryan v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 382. The Circuit Court,
however, held that the right in this particular case had
been decided not to exist, 152 Fed. Rep. 314, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 167 Fed. Rep.
514. 93 C. C. A. 150.
We are of opinion that the decision was right. In Southern Pacific Railroad Company v. United States, 168 U. S.
1, the lands in controversy embraced among others, as
stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, "lands within the Southern
Pacific indemnity limits and the Atlantic and Pacific'
granted limits; [and] lands within the common indemnity
limits of both grants "-ibid. 47. It was held that the
forfeiture to the United States did not enlarge the right of
the Southern Pacific to select the lands in question and
the decree was for the United States. The proposition
laid down in United States v. Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, 146 U. S. 570, and United States v. Colton
Marble & Lime Co., 146 U. S. 615, was applied to Southern
Pacific branch line' indemnity lands. Whatever may be
thought of the grounds for making an exception to the
principle of Ryan v. RailroadCo., supra, the exception was
established for this case. An elaborate argument was

UNITED STATES v. SOUTHERN PAC. R. R. CO. 565
223 U. S.

Syllabus.

made on petition for rehearing that the decision could not
be extended to indemnity lartds, but the petition was
denied. In Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States,
183 U. S. 519, the dismissal of the bill without prejudice to
claims that by interpretation are said to include indemnity
claims, imports no limitation of the previously established
law, and on the other hand in Southern PacificRailroad Co.
v. United States, 189 U. S. 447, 451, 452, the case in 168
U. S. 1, was followed and the practice of the Land Department in accordance with that decision was mentioned as a
further ground. There may be distinctions between the
latest decision and this, but in view of the rightly established understanding it is too late to set them up now.
Decree affirmed.

An indemnity grant, like the residuary clause in a will, contemplates
the uncertain and looks to the future, and what the party entitled
may elect to select depends upon the state of the lands at the time
of selection. Ryan v. Railroad Company, 99 U. S. 382.
