exist at law. But we express no opinion on that point.
because the matter must be decided by Spanish law,
which prevailed during the 'time When the laches is supposed to have been shown.
The case is a hard one, no doubt, if the plaintiffs ultimately should prevail on the strength of the old law of
prescription for mortgages and subsequent recognitions.
It should be scrutinized with care, not only with reference
to the property covered by the lien, but the nature of the
recognitions during the time when the bond could not
be denied, and the law. As -wehave intimated, -the record
leaves some doubt as to material facts, no argument was
presented to us on behalf of the appellees, and upon the
whole we think it will be-more conducive to justice if the
case be remitted to the District Court for further consid-.
eration. To ,that end the decree will be reversed.
Decree reversed without prejudice.

UNITED STATES v. WONG YOU.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 597.

Argued January 12, 1912.-Decided January 22,.1912.

The Alien Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, § 36, 34
Stat. 898, 908, applies to Chinese laborers illegally coming to this
country'notwithstanding the special acts relating to the exclusion

of Chinese.
To allow a subsequent general act its literal effect does not .repeal,
alter, or amend an earlier special law when the later law expressly
provides that it shall not have that effect.

on the same subject, excluding certain classes from its operation,

and inserting a provision applicable to such classes, signifies that
Congress intended to include that class in the operation of the later
act, notwithstanding the existence of other special .legislation in
regard thereto.
181 Fed. Rep. 313; 104 C. C. A. 535, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of § 36 of the
Alien Immigration Act of 1907 are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Harr for the United

States:
The application of the immigration laws to Chinese
aliens is well settled. The immigration act of March 3,
1893, 27 Stat. 569, 571, provided: "That this act shall
not apply to Chinese persons." But in the immigration
act of March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1213, 1221, § 36, and in
the act of February 20, 1907, 34 Stat. 898, 911, this
clause was changed so as to read: "That this act shall
not be construed, to repeal, alter, or amend existing laws
relating to the immigration or exclusion of Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent." This change indicates
the intent of Congress that the immigration act should
apply to Chinese aliens, although not affecting the operation of the exclusion laws, and such has been the practical
and judicial construction of this legislation.
In the opinion rendered June 24, 1903, Attorney General
Knox held that the Alien Immigration Act of March 3,
1903, authorized the exclusion of a Chinese alien afflicted
with a dangerous and contagious disease. 24 Op. Atty.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of habeas corpus: It was dismissed by
the District Court, 176 Fed. Rep. 933, hut was sustained
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which ordered the par.ties concerned to be discharged from custody. 181 Fed.
Rep. 313. 104 C. C. A. 535. The parties are Chinamen
-who entered the United States surreptitiously, in a manner
prohibited by the immigration act of February 20, 1907,
c. 1134, § 36, 34 Stat. 898, 908, and the rules made in
pursuance of the same, if applicable to Chinese. They
Were arrested in transitu and ordered by the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor to be deported. §§ 20, 21. But
as it transpired in the evidence that they were laborers,
the Circuit Court of Appeals held that they could be
dealt With only under the Chinese exclusion acts of earlier
date. Those acts make it unlawful for any Chinese laborer
to come from any foreign place into the United States, or,
having so come,, to remain there, and provide a different
procedure for removing them. Hence it was concluded
that such persons were tacitly excepted from the general
provisions of the immigration ad, although broad enough
to include them and although of later date.
We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals
made a mistaken use of its principles of interpretation.
By the language of the act any alien that enters the country
unlawfully may be summarily deported by Order of the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor at any time within
three years. It seems to us unwarranted to except the
Chinese from this liability because there is an earlier more
cumbrous proceeding which this partially overlaps. The
existence of the earlier laws only indicates th6 special
solicitude of the -0overnnent to limit the entrance of
Chinese. It is the very reverse of a reason for denying to
the Government a better remedy against them alone of all
the world, now that one has been created in general terms.

OCTOBER TERM, 1011.
Syllabus.

223 U. 8.

To allow the immigration act its literal effect does not
repeal, alter, or amend the laws relating to the Chinese,
as it is provided that it shall not, in § 43. The present act
does not contain the clause found in the previous immigration act of March 3, 1893, 27 Stat. 569,. c. 206, that it
'Shall not apply to Chinese persons, and, on the other
hand, as it r9quires deportation' to the trans-Pacific ports
from which such aliens embarked for the United States,
§ 35, 'it
is rather hard to say that it has not the Chinese
specially in mind.
Judgment reversed.

F. W. COOK BREWING CO.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 64. Submitted November 13, 1911.-Decided January 22, 191Z7
This court has jurisdiction of an appeal from the Circuit Court of
Appeals in this case, as the jurisdiction oE the Circuit Court did not
depend only on diversity of citizenship, but the constitutionality of
a state law and the construction of a Federal statute were also
involved.
Where relief in equity may be admissible under any circumstances at
all, the objection of adequate remedy at law comes too late when.
made for the first time in this court.
Where a common carrier threatens to abjure its functions and duties
a such in regard to a commodity, equity can graut relief to a dealer
in such commodity whose business would be rifmed by such'con.tinual action by the common carrier.
Beer and other intoxicating liquors are a recognized and legitimate
subject of interstate commerce.
