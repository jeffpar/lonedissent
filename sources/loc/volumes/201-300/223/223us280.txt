ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE RAILWAY
COMPANY v. O'CONNOR.
ERROR TO THE .CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.

No. 162. Argued January 24,.25, 1912.-Decided February 19, 1912.
One denying the legality of a tax. should have a clear and certain
remedy; and vhere he cannot interfere by injunction, an action to
recover back is the alternative, unless he waits until the State commences an action and subjects himself to penalties and risks.
Courts haye been too slow to recognize implied duress, in payment of
taxes, where payment thereof would result disadvantageously.
Where, in addition to money penalties for delay in payment of a tax,
there is forfeiture of right to do business and risk of having cofttracts declared, illegal in case of non-payment of disputed tax, the
payment is made under duress.
Where a state officer receives money for a tax paid under duress with
notice of its illbgality, he has no right thereto and the name of the
State does not protect him from suit.
Where a state statute provides for refunding taxes erroneously paid
to a state officer, it contemplates a suit against such officer to recover the taxes paid under protest and duress.

THE facts, which involve the right' to recover payments

for taxes paid under 'duress and what constitutes duress,
are stated in the opinion.

When the railway ,company in 1899 paid to the State
of Colorado the fees required of foreign corporations by
the law of 1897, and otherwise complied with the laws then
in force, it obtained a vested or contract right to transact
its business as a foreign corporation within that State

and the subsequent law of 1907, which attempted to impose an additional annual license tax for the same privileges, impaired the obligation of the contract between
the railway company and the State created by virtue of
a compliance with the law of 1897. American Smelting

at the option of the attorney general, be instituted. Lamborn v. County Commissioners, 97 U. S. 181; Railroad Co.

The general rule is that where an unfounded and illegal
demand is made upon a person and the law furnishes him
with an adequate protection against it, or gives him an
adequate remedy, and instead of taking what the law gives
him or the remedy it furnishes, he pays what is demanded,
such payment is deemed to be a voluntary one. 30 Cyc.

The plaintiff could have enjoined any effort to enforce
the collection of the tax. Ludwig v. West Un. Tel. CO.,

The plaintiff should have waited until an action was
brought either to collect the tax or to suspend its right to
do business, -and should then in such action have raised
the questions which it is attempted to raise in this suit
as the basis of i right to recover, or should have proceeded
by injunction. The fact that it paid under protest does
not make the payment involuntary. Railroad Co. v.

ATCHISON &c. RY. CO. v. O'CONNOR:
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.,

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is an action to recover taxes paid 'under duress
and protest, the plaintiff contending that the law under
which the tax was levied is unconstitutional. A demurrer
to the declaration was sustained by the Circuit Court.
.The tax is a tax of two cents upon each one thousand
dollars of the plaintiff's capital stock. Session Laws of
Colorado, 1907, c. 211 (April 1, 1907). The plaintiff is a
Kansas corporation. The greater part of its property and
business is outside of the State of Colorado, and of the
business done within that State but a small proportion
is local, the greater part being commerce among the
States. Therefore it is obvious that the tax is of the kind
decided by this court to be unconstitutional, since the
decision below in the present case, even if the temporary
forfeiture of the right to do business declared by the stat-t
ute be confined by construction, as it seems to have been
below, to business wholly within the State. Western
Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1. Pullman Co.
v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 56. Ludwig y. Western Union Telegraph Co., 216 U. S. 146. The defendant did not argue
that 'the tax could be maintained,, but contended only
that the payment was voluntary and that the defendant
is not the proper person to be sued.
It is reasonable that a man who denies the legality of a
tax should have a clear and certain remedy. The rule
being established that apart from special circumstances
he cannot interfere by injunction with the State's collection of its revenues, an action at law to recover back what
he has paid is the alternative left. Of course we are speaking of those cases where the State is not put to an action
if the citizen refuses to pay. In these latter he can interpose his objections by way of defence, but when, as is
common, the State has a more summary remedy, such as

distress, and the party indicates by protest that he is
yielding to what he cannot prevent, courts sometimes
perhaps have been a little too slow to recognize the implied duress under which payment is made. But even if
the State is driven 'to an action, if at the same time the
citizen is put at a serious disadvantage in the assertion
of his legal, in this case of his constitutional, rights, by
defence in the suit, justice may require that he should
be at liberty to avoid those disadvantages by paying
promptly and bringing suit on his side. He is entitled to
assert his supposed right on reasonably equal terms. See
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 146. If he should seek an
injunction on the principle of that case and .of Western
Union Telegraph Co. v. Andrews; 216 U. S. 165, he would
run the same risk as if he waited to be sued.
In. this"case the law, beside giving an action of debt to
the State, provides that every. corporation that fails. to
pay the tax shall forfeit its right to do business within the
State until the tax is paid, and also shall pay a penalty
of ten per cent. foi every six months or fractional, part of
six months of default after May 1 of each year. It may
be that the forfeiture of the right to do business would
not be authoritatively established except -bY a quo warranto provided for in a following section, but before- or
without the proceeding the, effect of the forfeiture clause
upon the plaintiff's subsequent contracts and business
might be serious, (see Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph
Co.,216 U. S. 146), and in any event the penalty would
go on accruing during all the time that might be spent
before the validity of the defence could be adjudged. As
appears from the decision below, the plaintiff could have
had no certainty of ultimate success, and we are of opinion
that it was not called upon to take the risk of having its
contracts disputed and its business injured and of finding
the tax more or less nearly doubled in case it finally had
to pay. In other words, we are of opinion that the pay-

Opinion of the Court.

ment was made under duress. See Gaar, Scott & Co. v.
Shannon, decided this day, post; p. 468.
The other question. is whether the defendant is liable
to the suit. The defendant collected the money and it is
alleged that he still has it. He was notified when he received: it that the plaintiff disputed his right. if he had
no right, as he had not, to collect the money, his doing so
in the name of the State cannot protect him. Erskihe v.
Van Arsdale, 15 Wall. 75. See Virginia Coupon Cases,
114 U. S. 270. It is said that the money as soon as collected belonged to the State. Very likely it would have
but for the plaintiff's claim, assuming it to remain an
identified trust fund; but the plhintiff's claim was paramount to that of the State, and even if the collector of
the tax were authorized to appropriate the specific, money
and to make himself debtor for the amount, it would be
inconceivable that the State should attempt to hold him
after he had been required to repay the sum. Moreover
it would seem that the statute contemplated the course
taken by the plaintiff and provided against any difficulty
in which the Secretary of State otherwise might find himself in case of a disputed tax. For it provides by § 6 that
"if it shall be determined in any action at law or in equity
that any corporation has erroneously paid said tax to the
Secretary of State,' upon the filing of a certified copy of
the judgment the auditor may draw a warrant for the
refunding of the tax and the state treasurer may pay it.
We must presume that a judgment in the present action
would satisfy the law.
Judgment reversed.
