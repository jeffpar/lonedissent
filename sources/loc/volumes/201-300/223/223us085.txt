WASKEY v. HAMMER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 84. Argued December 7, 1911.-Decided January 22, 1912.
A discovery of mineral within the limits of a mining claim is essential
to its validity; proximity will not.suffice.
An original location is invalidated by readjusting the lines so as to
exclude the-point or place of the only prior discovery.
A readjusted location becomes effective as of the date of the readjustment as though it were a new one, and if the locator is disqualified
at the time of the readjustment, the location is invalid.
A prohibition against purchase of public lands by officers of the Land
Department and employ~s is to prevent abuse and inspire confidence
in administration of the land laws, and should be construed broadly
to include officials and employ~s of subordinate offices and all
methods of securing title to public -lands under the general laws.
A United States mineral surveyor is disqualified under § 452, Rev.
Stat., from making a mining location.
Although the opinion may possibly go beyond the necessities of the
case concerning the statute, if it states the natural effect to be given
to a statute, and that view is accepted and acted upon ,for many
years by the Department enforcing it, the construction should not
be disturbed.
The general rule of law that an act done in violation of statutory
prohibition is void and confers no right upon .the wrongdoer, held
applicable in this case and not.subject to the qualification that it
was the legislative intent that under the circumstances of the case
the statute should not apply.
The fact that a statute prescribes a penalty for the doing of a prohibited act does not, confine the scope of the statute to the prohibition, or make the prohibited act valid as against parties other than
the Government, and so held as to § 452, Rev. Stat.
170 Fed. Rep. 31, affrmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the mining
laws of the United.States and conflicting claims thereunder,
are stated in the opinion.

The cases arising under the National Banking Acts are
analogous, and this court has uniformly held that securities taken in violatic n.of law are enforceable by the banks,
when their validity has been questioned by private persons,
the same being voidable only at the instance of the Government on office found. National Bank v. Matthews, 98U. S. 621, 627; Oates v, NationalBank, 100 U. S. 239, 249;

While the construction so given by a Department of the
Government to any law affecting'its arrangements is certainly entitled to great respect, still, however, if it is not in
conformity to the true'intendment, and provisions of the
law, it cannot be permitted to conclude the judgment of a.

A deputy mineral surveyor., is not either an "officer,
clerk or employ6" in the, General Land Office. See § 10,
act of April 25, 1812, establishing a General Land Office,
2 Stats. 716; act of July 4, 1836, reorganizing the General
Land Office, 5 Stats. 107;.§§ 2207, 2319, 2334, Rev..Stat.;

A deputy 'mineral surveyor has no duties whatever
to perform outside of the surveying of 1the mining claims
owned-by private parties by whom he is employed.
A deputy mineral surveyor is not an officer within the
provisions of §452. UnitedStates v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385;
United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508; United States
v. Mouat, 124 U. 8. 303,'307; United States v. Smith, 124
U. S.525, 532.
A deputy mineral surveyor is not a clerk in the General
Land,0ffice. As to definition of 'clerk, see Bouvier's Law
Dictionary; People v. Fire Commissioners, 73 N. Y. 437,
442; Satterlea v. Pblice Board, .75N. Y..38; People v. Fire
Commissioners, 73 N. Y. 437, 442.
A deputy mineral surveyor is not an employ6 in the
General Land Office. As to definition of employ6 see
Century Dictionary; Standard. Dictionary; McCluskey v.
Cromwell, 1i.N. Y. 593.
A Uited. States mineral surveyor receives no compensation from the United States of any kind or character.

By any fair interpretation of its terms, § 432 does not
include United States deputy mineral surveyors. Where
a statute plainly points out the persons subject to its
provisions no others can by construction be brought within
the purview thereof. 26 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.),

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was an action of ejectment, the subject-matter of
which was the overlapping portions of two placer mining
claims in Alaska, one known as the Golden Bull and the
other as the Bon Voyage. The plaintiffs claimed the area
in conflict as. part of the Golden Bull, and the defendants
claimed it as part of the Bon Voyage. The facts, as
they must be accepted for present purposes, are these:
In 1902 the Bon Voyage was located by J. Potter Whittren, he having previously made a discovery of placer
gold within the ground which he included in the claim.
Although not intended to be excessive, the claim embraced
a trifle more than twenty acres, the maximum area permitted in a location by one person. In 1903 Whittren, upon
ascertaining that fact, drew ija two of the boundary lines sufficiently to exclude the excess, and in doing so left the point
or place of his only prior mineral discovery outside the readjusted lines. "Later in 1903, he made a discovery of placer
gold within the lines as readjusted. At the time of drawing
in the lines and making the subsequent discovery he was
an United States mineral surveyor, but was not such at
the time of the original location. In 1904 the Golden

Bull was located by B. Schwartz, and included a part of
the ground embraced in the Bon Voyage. Neither clairh
was carried to .atent or entry, and when the action was
begun the defendants were in possession. The plaintiffs
other than Schwartz claimed under him, and.the defendants other than Whittren claimed under'conveyances from
him mnade after 1904.
Upon the trial the court, at the instance of the plaintiffs, directed a verdict in their favor, 'substantially upon
.the following grounds, taken collectively: 1. A discovery of

mineral within the limits 0f14 mining claim is essential to
its validity;. 2. The original location of the Bon Voyage
-was invalidated by the readjustment of its lines whereby
the point orplace of the only prior discovery of mineral
was left without those lines; 3. The readjusted location
was invalid because at the time of the disc overy of mineral
therein Whitfren, being an United States mineral surveyor,.
•was disquaiified to/make a location under themining laws.
The jury. returned a verdict .as directed, judgment was
entered thereon, the. judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 170 Fed.
.Rep. 31, and the case is here upon certiorari. 216 U. S..
Conceding that the unintentional inclusion of a trifle
,,,more than twenty acres in the Bon Voyage as originally
located was an irregular-ity which did not vitiate the location, but merely made it necessary that the ,excess be
excluded when it became known (Richmond-Mining Co.
v. Rose, 114 U. S.. 576, 580; McIntosh v. Price, 121 Fed.
Rep. 716; Zimmerman v. Funchion, 161 Fed. Rep. 859),
we come to consider whether the location was invalidated
when, by the readjustment of its lines, it wasleft without a
.mineral discover therein. The mining laws,. Rev. Stat.
§§ 2320, 2329, make the discovery of mineral "within the
clam,
limits of the claim" a prerequisite to the location of a.
whether lode ,or placer, the purpose being to reward the,

Opinion of the Court.

discoverer and to prevent the location of land not found to
be mineral. A discovery without the limits of the claim,
no matter what its proximity, does not suffice. In giving
effect to this restriction, this court said, in Gwillim v.
Donnellan, 1-151U. S. 45, that the loss of that part of a
location which embraces the place of the only discovery
therein is "a loss of the location." Possibly what was said'
went beyond the necessities of that case, critically considered, but it illustrates what naturally would be taken to
be the effect of the statute; and as that view of it has been
accepted and acted upon for twenty-five years by the Land
Department and by the courts in the mining regions, it
should not be disturbed now. It follows that when, in
1903, Whittren excluded from the Bon Voyage the only.
place at which mineral had been discovered therein, he
lost the location. That his purpose was not to give up the
location, but only to eliminate the excess in area, is immaterial, because, althcugh free to exclude any other
part of the claim and to retain that embracing the discovery, he excluded the latter and thereby caused the
location to be without a discovery within its limits. Possibly, as was suggested in argument, the discovery was
excluded because it was not deemed sufficiently promising
to make its retention advisable, but, however that may
have been, its exclusion defeated the location and left the
-lands therein "open to exploration and subject to claim
for new discoveries." Gwillim v. Donnell.an, supra.
As no adverse right had intervened at the time of Whittren's-subsequent discovery of mineral within the limits
of the readjusted location, it must be conceded that that
location became effective as of that time, just as if he
had then marked those limits anew (2 Lindley on Mines,
§§ 328, 330), unless he was then disqualified to make a lo-'
cation by reason of his having become an United States
mineral surveyor; and so it is necessary to consider whether
such a surveyor is within the prohibition of Rev. Stat.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court,

223 U. S.

§ 452, and, if so, whether that prohibition made the re-

adjusted location void, or only voidable at the instance of
the Government. That section reads:
"The officers, clerks, and employ&s in the General
Land Office are prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing or becoming'interested in the purchase Of any of
the public land; and any personwho violates this section
shall forthwith be removed from his office."
Mineral surveyors are appointed by the surveyor general
under Rev. Stat., §2334, and their field of action is confined to the surveying of mi'ning claims and to matters
incident thereto. They act only at the solicitation of
owners of such claims, and are paid by the owners, not

by the Government; but their charges must be within
the maximum. fixed by the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, and their work must be done in conformity
to regulations prescribed by that officer. They are required to take an oath, and to execute a bond to the
United States, as are many public officers. Within the
limits of their authority they act in the stead of the surveyor general and under his direction, and in that sense
are his deputies. The work which they do is the work of
the Government, and the surveys which they 'make are
its surveys. The right performance of their duties is of
real concern, not merely to those at whose solicitation they
act, but also to the owners of adjacent and conflicting
claims and to the Government. Of the representatives of
the Government who have to do with the proceedings
incident to applications for patents to mining claims,
they alone come in contact with the land itself, and have
an opportunity to observe its situation and character,
and the extent and nature of the work done and improvements made thereon; and it is upon their reports that the
surveyor general makes the certificate required by Rev.
Stat., §2325, which is a prerequisite to the issuance of a
patent. See Mining Regulations of July 26, 1901, para-

graphs 90, 115-169, 31 Land Dec. 474, 489, 493; Gowdy
v. Kismet Gold Mining Co., 24 Land Dec. 191, 193. This
r~sum6* of their authority and duties, and of their relation to the surveyor general and the General Land Office,
satisfies us that they are within the prohibition of § 452.
That prohibition is addressed not merely to the officers of
the General Land Office, or to its officers and clerks, but
These words,
to its "officers, clerks and employ~s."
taken collectively, are very comprehensive and easily
embrace all persons holding positions under that office and
participating in the work assigned to it, as is the case with
mineral surveyors. The purpose of the prohibition is to
guard against the temptations and partiality- likely to
attend efforts to acquire public lands, or interests therein,
by persons so situated, and thereby to prevent abuse and
inspire confidence in the administration of the public-land
laws. So understanding the letter and purpose of the
prohibition, we think it embraces the location, of a mining
claim by a mineral surveyor.' True, it is addressed to
officers, clerks and employ~s "in the General Land Office"
and is directed against "the purchase of any of the public
land" by them, but in view of the terminology common
to public-land legislation, we- think the reference to the
General Land Office is inclusive of the subordinate offices-or,
branches maintained under its supervision, such as the
offices of the surveyors-general and the local land offices,.
and that the term "purchase" is inclusive of the various
modes of securing title to or rights in public lands under
the general laws regulating their disposal.
That the construction which we here place upon § 452
is the one prevailing in the Land Department is shown in
its circular of September 15,. 1890, 11 Land Dec. 348,
wherein it is said: "All officers, clerks and employds in
the offices of the surveyors general, the local land offices,
and the General Land Office, or any persons, wherever
located, employed under the supervision of the Coin-

missioner of the General Land Office, are, during such
employment, prohibited from entering or becoming interested, directly or indirectly, in any of the public lands
of the United States." The published decisions of the
Secretary of the Interior, although disclosing instances
in which that construction has been departed from or
doubted, Dennison and Willits, 11 -Copp's Land-Owner,
261; Lock Lode, 6 Land. Dec. 105; W. H. Lefflngwell, 30
Land Dec. 139, show that in the main it has been closely
followed. 'Herbert McMicken, 10 Land Dec. 97, and 11
Land Dec. 96 ;'Muller v. Coleman, 18 Land Dec. 394; John
S. M. Neill, 24 Land Dec. 393; Floyd v. Montgomery, 26
Land Dec. 122, 136; Frank A. Maxwell, 29 Land Dec. 76;
Alfred Baltzell, 29 Land Dec. 333; Seymour K. Bradford,
36 Land Dec. 61.
In principle, the recent case of Prosserv. Finn, 208 U. S.
67, goesfar to sustain the view here expressed. There a
special agent of the General Land Office, whose field of
duty was in the State of Washington, made an entry of
public land unde

the timber-culture law, and there-

after in all respects complied. with that law. But it was
held by this court that he was, in every substantial sense,
an employ6 in the General Land Office, and therefore was
within the prohibition of § 452.
The general rule of law is that an act done in violation
of a statufory prohibition is void and confers no right upon
the-wrongdoer, but this rule is subject to the qualification
that when, upon a survey of the statute,' its subject-matter
and the mischief sought to be prevented, it appears that
the legislature intended otherwise, effect- must be given to
that intention. Miller v. Ammon, 145 U. S. 421, 426;
Burck v" Taylor, 152 U. S. 634, 649; Connolly v. Union
'Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 548. Here we think the
general rule applies. The acts described -in §452 are expressly prohibited under:penalty of' dismissal. There is in
its language nothing indicating that its, Scope is to be con-

fined to the exaction of that penalty, Prosserv. Finn,8upra,
or that acts done in violation of it are to be valid against
all but the Government. Nor is there anything in its
subject-matter or in the mischief sought to be prevented
which militates against the application of the general rule.
On the contrary, it is reasonably inferable, from the language of the section and the situation with which it deals,
that it is intended that violations of it shall be attended
by the ordinary consequences of unlawful acts. We therefore are of opinion that the readjusted location was void.
