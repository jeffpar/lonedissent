Argument for Appellant.

LATIMER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR PORTO RICO.
No. 151.

Submitted January 15, 1912.-Decided February 19, 1912.

Congress, in framing a tariff law, will be presumed to use words of a
former tariff law as having the same meaning which this court has
already given to them.
This court, having held that "unmanufactured tobacco" as used in
the Tariff Act of 1883, included sweepings of factories and warehouses used after importation in manufacturing cigarettes and
stogies, the same meaning will be given to the same words as used
in the Tariff Act of 1897. Seeberger v. Castro, 153 U. S. 32.
"Waste" as used in a tariff act generally refbrs to remnants and
by-products of small value that have not the quality or utility either
of the finished product or of the raw material. "Scrap" does retain
the name and quality. Patton v. United States, 159 U. S. 503.
5 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 138, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the classification of tobacco
scraps under the Tariff Act of 1897, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Walter F. Welch, with whom Mr. Edward S. Hatch
was on the brief, 'for appellant:
The merchandise involved in this suit is waste.
Merchandise is classifiable for the purposes of duty in
its condition as imported. Worthington v. Robbins, 139
U. S. 337; Dwight v. Merritt, 140 U. S. 219; United States
v. Schoverling, 146 U. S. 82. It is not, therefore, a fact
material to the classification of this merchandise that
there are recoverable portions of it suitable, when recovered, for making cheap stogies.
All waste has a value through the recovery from it of
more or less valuable constituents. A levy of ten per

cent. ad valorem on waste under the Tariff Act presupposes
that waste materials are valuable.
Whether this waste is properly classifiable as waste or
as tobacco unmanufactured has never been authoritatively decided. Seeberger v. Castro, 153 U. S. 32, did not
decide that a tariff provision for unmanufactured tobacco
is more specific than a provision for waste. See United
States v. Baversdorfer, 126 Fed. Rep. 732.
The Seeberger Case is not an authority on the issue now
here for determination and is not binding in deciding this
case.
This court does not review, upon a writ of error, errors
of law which do not appear of record or by bill of exceptions. Clausen v. United States, 142 U. S. 140; Kreshower
v. United States, T. D. 27,826; Sears-Roebuck & Co. v.
United States, T. D. 32,055.
A decided case, holding goods dutiable under a particular paragraph of a tariff act, is not binding in a later
case which raises an issue as to the applicability of a paragraph not drawn to the attention of the court nor discussed in the decided case relied on.
The merchandise is more specifically provided for as
"waste" than as "tobacco unmanufactured."
As the issue stated in this point has never been decided
-by any court previous to the decision of the court below
herein, the question is open whether these tobacco sweepings are more appropriately classifiable and dutiable as
"waste" than as "tobacco unmanufactured." Brennan
v. United States, 136 Fed. Rep. 743.
The rule applied by the board in the case of cork bark
waste, marble waste, ramie waste, jute waste and mica
waste, should be applied equally to tobacco waste. United
States v. Reiss, 136 Fed. Rep. 741; Nairn Linoleum Co. v.
United States, 142 Fed. Rep. 214; T. D. 16,324, G. A.

LATIMER v. UNITED STATES.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

All doubtful questions must be resolved favorably to
the importer. Hartranft v. Wiegman, 121 U. S. 609, 616;
Powers v. Barney, 5 Blatchf. 202.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Wemple for the United
States.
MR.

JUSTICE LAMAR

delivered the opinion of the court.

In the process of manufacturing and handling tobacco
small pieces are broken from the brittle leaves, and fall to
the floor of the warehouse or factory. These scraps are
not treated as- worthless, but are swept up, and, when
cleaned, are used in the manufacture of a cheap grade of
cigarettes and stogies.
The plaintiff in error shipped to Porto Rico a quantity
of these sweepings, and the question arose as to whether
the shipment was dutiable at 10 per cent. ad valorem as
"waste, not specially provided for in this Act," under
ยง 463 of the Tariff Act of 1897; or, at 55 cents a pound
as "tobacco, manufactured or unmanufactured," under
ยง 215 of the same statute. (30 Stat. 194, 169.) The
customs officer classed it as "unmanufactured tobacco,"
and required the payment of a duty of 55 cents a pound.
The importer protested and a case was made to test the
question. On appeal the General Board' sustained the
collector. It was affirmed by the District Court of Porto
Rico, and to reverse that judgment the importer has
brought the case here.
There has been some difference of opinion as to the
proper classification of scrap 'tobacco under the various
tariff acts. In United States-v. Schroeder, 93 'Fed. Rep.
448, a higher -grade of scrap was held to be "waste" within
the meaning of the Tariff Act of 1890. In Seeberger v.
Castro, 153 U. S. 32, it was decided that the clippings from
the ends of -cigars were dutiable as unmanufactured
tobacco under the Tariff Act of 1883.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

The plaintiff claims that this decision has no application

here, because it related to clippings which were of a higher
grade than scrap, and for the further reason that, as the
importer there made no claim that it should be taxed as
waste, the court did not pass on that question. But it
did definitely decide that such material, by whatever
name called, was "unmanufactured tobacco."
The words' having received such a construction under
the act of 1883, must be given the same meaning when
used in the Tariff Act of 1897, on the theory that, in using
the phrase in the later statute, Congress adopted the construction already given it by this court. United States v.
Baruch, this day decided, ante, p. 191. That such was
the intention of Congress appears further from the fact
that the duty of "10 per cent. ad valorem on waste" is
found in "Schedule N-Sundries." The word as thus
used generally refers to remnants and by-products of
small value that have not the quality or utility either of
the finished product or of the raw material. Patton v.
United States, 159 U. S.500, 503. But the scrap here involved retains the name and quality of tobacco. It is
tobacco, and as such it is used for making cigarettes and
stogies. It was therefore taxable under Schedule F, which
fixes the duty on tobacco in all its forms-manufactured
or unmanufactured. The judgment is therefore
Affirmed.
