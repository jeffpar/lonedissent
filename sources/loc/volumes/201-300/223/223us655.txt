subject to certain requirements. Those requirements may
not be dispensed with, but they may be supplemented,
-certainly to the extent (and we need go no farther in this
case) prescribed by the Arizona statute. It is a provision
strictly "governing the location," and is not repugnant
either to the spirit or the letter of the mining laws of the
United States. Butte City Water Co. v. Baker, 196 U. S.

Judgment affirmed.

CEDAR RAPIDS GAS LIGHT COMPANY v. CITY
OF CEDAR RAPIDS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IOWA.
No. 163.

Argued February 29, 1912.-Decided March 11, 1912.

Where the general power reserved to regulate rates is only limited by
the Fourteenth Amendment, no franchise contract will be presumed
to imply that the municipality under its reserved right to regulate
rates must only reduce them to such a point that there will be a
margin to allow a discount for prompt payment.
A municipal ordingnce drawn in form of a contract to be accepted by
the franchisee, when accepted becomes a contract and is subject to
the reserved powers of the municipality as limited by the laws of
the State.
The practice and decisions of this court are that § 709 Rev. Stat.
does not give to a writ of error to the state court in a chancery case
the effect of an appeal from a judgment in such a case in the Federal courts and open the evidence for redxamination in this court.
Findings of the state court in cases either at law or in equity may depend upon questions that are redxaminable in this court, which, if
properly saved, must be answered; and this court may examine the
evidence in so far as necessary to do so in respect to rulings within
the appellate jurisdiction of this court. KansasCity Southern Railway

because it is too low to permit a further reduction in the way of
discount for cash payment.
The state court having treated a public utility corporation fairly as to
value of plant depreciation, and found that the net returns would
exceed six per cent, and given it leave to try the case again after
the legislative rate had been in effect, this court does not feel warranted in reversing on the ground that the rate is confiscatory because in some details this court might have treated the corporation
differently,

facts, which involve the validity, under the contract and due process provisions of the Constitution of
the United States, of an ordinance of the City of Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, fixing the price of gas at ninety cents per
thousand cubic feet, are stated in the opinion.
THE

Mr. James H. Trewin, with whom Mr. John N. Hughes'
and Mr. John M. Grim were on the brief, for plaintiff in
error:
There is no conflict in the evidence as to the value and
efficiency of. the discount provision of the franchise. The
ordinance granting the plaintiff in error a franchise is a
contract. Water Co. v. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 118 Iowa, 234;
Dartmouth College Case, 4 Wheat. 518.
An unconditional grant by a State constitutes a contract, which is entitled to protection under the Constitution just as fully as a grant made by an individual.

Plaintiff in error cannot provide for a discount below
ninety cents and earn any return on its property whatever. It -is, therefore, deprived by the ordinance of the
discount provision contained in its franchise. The company cannot impose a penalty for the violation of one of
:its regulations, nor refuse to furnish gas on the failure of
the consumer to pay the penalty. Shepard v. Milwaukee

The ninety cent rate ordinance abrogates the sliding
scale of prices for gas. It is lawful and proper to make
lower rates to large consumers based on a sliding scale
available to all. Skillman v. Board, 152 N. Y. 327; Wagoner v. Rock Island, 146 Illinois, 139; Brunswick Elec. v.

The ordinance takes plaintiff's property without just
compensation and due process of law. The evidence shows
that the ninety cent rate would not enable plaintiff to earn
fair and reasonable compensation upon its property.
The basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of
the rates to be charged by a corporation furnishing gas to
the public is the fair value of the property being so used
at the time of fixing the rate. Willcox v. Gas Co. of New

To deprive the plaintiff of a fair and reasonable earning
capacity, such as the citizen enjoys, as to his money and
as to all types of his property, is to deprive it of the equal
protection of the laws. C., M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418.

It is proper to apply the prescribed rate to the past
experience of the company, taking into consideration the

Annual income of 4.41 on value of property or 3.30 per

cents per M., and in refusing to allow as part of operating

This, court has jurisdiction of the questions raised

The questions under both constitutional provisions

Supreme Court of, Iowa. California Powder Works v.
Davis, 151 U. S.389; Armstrong v. Athens Co., 16 Pet. 281.
A decision of the Federal questi6n in terms is not essential. If a decision of such question was necessarily involved in the judgment rendered it is not a matter ofimportance that the state court avoided all reference to the
question. Chapman v. Goodnow, 123 U. S.540; Chicago'

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill brought by the plaintiff in error to restrain
the,enforcement of an ordinance fixing ninety cents per
thousand cubic feet as the highest price to be charged in
Cedar Rapids for gas. As the ordinance was passed in
1906 .and had not. yet been enforced, the Supreme Court
of the State dismissed the bill without prejudice to a later
suit after it should have been given a fair test. 144 Iowa,

223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

426. The plaintiff, having specially set up that the ordinance violated the contract clause of the Constitution,
(Art. I, § 10), and the Fourteenth Amendment, brings
the case here. There is a motion to dismiss, but the constitutional questions appear upon the record and are not
so frivolous as to warrant that summary course.
The supposed contract arises from a term in the ordinance under which the plaintiff was granted a renewal of
its franchise in 1896. By § 3, "in consideration: of the
privileges herein granted to said company, it shall furnish
to the inhabitants of said city gas for lighting at a price
not to exceed-$1.80 per thousand feet and 20 cents per
thousand .cubic feet discount if consumers pay on or before the 10th of each month'after consumption," &c. It
is admitted that under the laws of Iowa the rate could be
changed by the city, but it is argued that the quotedwords
import a contract that it shall not be changed to such an
extent as to make. impossible the offer of a discount for
prompt payment; that being the cheapest-and most efficient way of collecting the price of the gas. The state
court assumed that there was no contract in the case,
and in discussing what it treated as the sole question,
whether the plaintiff would be deprived of a fair compensation for its services, pointed out that the company could
secure payment by requiring a deposit in advance or by
making other reasonable rules.
We are of opinion that there was no contract on the
part of the citythat the price should be kept high enough
to allow a discount for prompt payment. The general
power reserved to regulate rates was limited only by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The words relied upon by the
plaintiff express its promise in consideration of the privileges granted, not a promise by the city. Knoxville Water
Co.. v. Knoxville, 189 U. S. 434, 437. It is true that the
contract was in the form of an ordinance, but the ordinance
was drawn as a contract to be accepted and it was ac-

cepted by the plaintiff; it contained reciprocal undertakings, the one in question being that of the plaintiff,
.,as we have said; and it was subject to the power retained
by the city ta regulate rates. That power, it was expressly
provided by the Iowa statute, was not to be abridged by
ordinance, 'resolution or contract. Code of 1897, § 725,
22 G. A. (1888) ch. 16.
:.Upon the issue under the Fourteenth Amendment, the
plaintiff argues on the strength of Rev. Stat., § 709, that
.the facts are open to reexamination here. By that section
it is provided that a writ of error to a state court "shall
have the same effect as if the judgment or decree complained of had been rendered or passed in a court of the
United States." It is argued that as the decree pf a state
court can. be reviewed only by writ of error the foregoing
words give to a writ of error in a chancery case the effect
of an appeal and open the evidence to reexamination to
the same extent as upon an appeal. A suggestion to that
effect wds'made in Republican River Bridge Co. v. Kansas
Pacific Ry. Co., 92 1J. S. 315, 317, but the practice and decisions from an early date have been the other way.

. But of course findings either at law or in equity may
depend upon questions that are rexaminable here. The
admissibility of evidence or its sufficiency to warrant the
conclusion reached may be denied; or the conclusion may
be a composite of fact and law, such as ownership or contract; or in. some way the record may disclose that the
finding necessarily involved a ruling within .the appellate
jurisdiction of this court. Such questions properly saved
must be answered, and, so far as it is necessary to examine

the evidence in order to answer them or to prevent an
evasion of real issues, the evidence will be examined.
Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. Albers Commission
Co., decided February 26, 1912, ante, p. 573. For instance
in this case the finding of the court that it was not prepared
to say that a ninety cent rate was confiscatory may perhaps be taken to have been made subject to the admission
that the rate Was too low to permit a discount for prompt
payment, and if so opens the question whether it was not
confiscatory on that accotmt, as matter of law. The plaintiff presents a number of such objections to the decision
of the cgurt-,below, although confused with arguments on
pure matter of fact.
It would require a very clear case to warrant the reversal of the decree of a state court which though final in
form merely postpones a decision upon the merits for
further experience. The present one is far from being
such a case. To refer in the first instance to the point
just mentioned, we cannot say as matter of law that at
ninety cents a thousand feet the company will be unable
to collect payment without losses that will amount to a
taking of its property. Then again, although it is argued
that the court excluded going value, the court expressly
took into account the fact that the plant was in successful
operation. What it excluded was :the good will or advantage incident to the possession of a monopoly, so far as
that might be supposed to give the plaintiff the power to
charge more than a reasonable price. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 52. An adjustment of this
sort under a power to regulate rates has to steer between
Scylla and Charybdis. On the one side if the franchise is
taken to mean that the most profitable return that could
be got, free from c6mpetition, is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, then the power to. regulate is null.
On the other hand if the power to regulate withdraws the
protection of the Amendment altogether, then the prop-

erty is nought. This is not a matter of economic theory,
but of fair interpretation of a bargain. Neither extreme
can have been meant. A midway between them must be

hit.
In this case the court fixed a value on the plant that
considerably exceeded its cost and estimated that under
the ordinance the return would be over 6 per cent. Its
9ttitude was-fair and we do not feel called upon to follow
the plaintiff into a nice discussion of details. We perhaps
should have adopted a rule as to depreciation somewhat
more favorable to the plaintiff, or, it iay be, might have
allowed this or that item that the state court struck out,
but there is nothing of which we can take notice in the
case that could warrant us in changing the result or in
saying that the plaintiff did not get as much as it could
expect when leave was reserved for it to try again.

No. 176..

Argued February 29, 1912.-Decided March 11, 1912.

Afterfiling of a bill for injunction, defendants proceed at their peril,
and even if no preliminary injunction is issued, if they inflict actionable wrong upon the plaintiff, the bill can be retained for assessment
of damages; but if the only ground left for further prosecution is
costs, the appeal will be dismissed.
Where pending trial below and hearing of appeal the object unsuccessfully, sought to be enjoined has been accomplished-in this case the
erection of a building by a bank-the only ground left for further
prosecution is costs, and the appeal will be dismissed.
