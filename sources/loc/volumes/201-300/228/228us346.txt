ward a final hearing and decree. Further proofs were
yet to be taken, and not until that was done could the
entire controversy presented by the pleadings be adjudicated. This was recognized by the retention of the case
for further orders and by the subsequent reference to a
special master to take the remaining proofs. Plainly
such a decree is not appealable. If it were, the case could
be taken to the appellate court in fragments by successive
appeals. But this the law wisely prevents by postponing
the right of appeal until there is a final decree disposing
of the whole case. Perkins v. Fourniquet, 6 How. 206;

MICHIGAN TRUST COMPANY v. FERRY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 200,*201.

Argued March 20, 1913.-Decided April 21, 1913.

While ordinarily jurisdiction over a person is based on the power of
the sovereign to seize and imprison*him, it is one of the decencies of
civilization that when the power exists and has been asserted at the
beginning of a, cause, the necessity of maintaining the physical power
is dispensed with.
Under the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution, if a
judicial proceeding is begun with jurisdiction over the .person of the
party concerned, it is within the power of the State to bind that

person by every subsequent order in the cause.

MICHIGAN TRUST CO. v. FERRY.
228 U. S.

Argument for Respondent.

A State may make the whole administration of the estate a single proceeding and provide that one undertaking it within the jurisdiction
shall be subject to the order of the court until the estate is closed,
and that he must account for all that he recovers by order of the
probate court.
Under the law of Michigan an executor who has been removed must
account to the administrator de bonis non for all property that has
come into his hands, and he is bound by a decree of the probate court
in a proceeding in which he has been personally served with notice
or appeared.
Courts of other jurisdictions owe great deference to what the court
concerned with the case has.done; the probabilities are that the local
procedure follows the traditions of the place.
This court will assume that the decree of a probate court charging an
executor with all the goods of the testator that had come into his
possession and with waste in neglect to pay over was within its
jurisdiction.
Want of power of the court making it to enforce a decree does not
affect its validity, and if the court had jurisdiction at the inception
of the case, courts of other States must give it full faith and credit.
Jurisdiction is power and is not affected by the insanity of one over
whom the court has acquired jurisdiction, and an executor against
whom a decree is entered after appearance, appointment of guardian
ad lit~m and full consideration of the case at the expense of the estate,
is not deprived of his property without due process of law by such
decree.
175 Fed. Rep. 667, 681, reversed.

credit to be given by the courts of one State to a decree
of the probate court of another State, ,are stated in the

Argument for Respondent.

228 U. S.

No court under our system of jurisprudence has power
to render a personal judgment against one who resides
beyond the territorial limits of the court upon constructive service of process on him in the place of his residence
and without personal service of process upon him within
the jurisdiction of the court, or after his voluntary appearance. Such action is beyond the jurisdiction of the
court, and any judgment so rendered is absolutely void,
and therefore not protected by the full faith and credit
clause of the Federal Constitution. The enforcement of
such a judgment in another jurisdiction would be a
deprivation of property without due process of law.

A personal judgment is without validity if rendered by
a state court in an action upon a money demand against
a non-resident of the State, upon whom no personal
service of process within the State was made, and who did
not appear. Goldey v. Morning News, 156 U. S. 518, 521;

In Utah a judgment in favor of an administrator de
bonis non against the former executor is absolutely void.
Reed v. Hume, 25 Utah, 248.
No court under our system of jurisprudence has power
to render a decree in excess of the claim for relief demanded
in the process and pleadings in the particular proceeding
before it. The enforcement of such a decree would violate
the due process clause of the Federal Constitution. In re

The probate court of Michigan is a court of limited

The decree of the probate court was not in favor of
the Michigan Trust Company, for it was not a party to
the proceeding upon which the decree was based and
therefore it had no right of action upon the decree. Louieiana Bank v. Whitney, 121 U. S. 284; Hookpayton v.

As the decree of the probate court was rendered in

2d ed., ยง 187; Stacy v. Thrasher,6 How. 60.
The decree also lacks the first essential element of a
final judgment because it neither concludes the right of
Edward P. Ferry to participate in the trust fund alleged to
be owing by him to the estate of his father nor determines
the extent of his participation. Martinez v. Int. Banking

There is no privity between a guardian appointed in one
State and a guardian appointed in another State to the
same mentally incompetent person. Therefore, an action
will not lie against the general guardians of Edward P.
Ferry or against Edward P. Ferry personally in Utah on
an alleged judgment obtained against him personally in a
proceeding in Michigan in which a guardian ad litem
attempted to act for him as executor. Vaughn v. Northup,

Neither the probate court in Michigan nor any other
court has power to create a guardian ad litem for a nonresident incompetent executor. The appointment of a
guardian ad litem can be made only where the proceeding
is against an infant or incompetent, personally, or against
his individual property, and then only after first having
obtained proper service of process. 15 Enc. of Law, 2d

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 435.
When the defendant removed from Michigan and judicially was declared mentally incompetent by the Utah
court and his person and property taken into the custody
of that court under general guardianship proceedings there,
his office as executor in Michigan became vacant, and the
probate court of Michigan lost all jurisdiction whatever
over him. It could not proceed to settle his accounts
as executor, even for unadministered assets of his father's
estate. Such an accounting could be had only in a suit
in equity in which the defendant's general guardians in
Utah would be given their day in court. Bush v. Lindsey,
44 California, 121; Farnsworth v. Oliphant, 19 Barb.

In the instant case there is a plain and adequate remedy,
and the law allows it. The residuary distributees of the
estate of William M. Ferry never have been prevented
from suing Edward P. Ferry in an action for an equitable
accounting in Utah where he easily can be found, and where
his representatives stand ready to respond to any just
demand against him. Salter v. Williamson, 2 N. J. Eq.

These are suits 'brought in the Circuit Court for the

Ottawa, Michigan. The defendant demurred to the complaints, the Circuit Court sustained the demurrers and

gave judgments for the defendant, and these judgments
were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 175 Fed.
Rep. 667. Id. 681. 99 C. C. A. 221. Id. 235. A short
statement of the facts alleged at great length in the complaints will be enough.
William 'M. Ferry died in 1867 domiciled in Ottawa
County, Michigan. His will was proved, and the defendant, Edward P. Ferry, was appointed executor by
the Ottawa Probate Court, qualified and entered upon
his duties. In 1878 he removed to Utah and becoming
incompetent was put under the guardianship of two sons,
W. Mont Ferry and Edward S. Ferry, in 1892. In 1903
residuary legatees and devisees petitioned the Michigan
Probate Court that the defendant be removed from his
office of executor, that he be ordered to account for the
unadministered residue of the estate and that the Michigan
Trust Company be aplgointed administrator de bonis non
with the will annexed. Notice of the petition and time and
place of the hearing was given by publication and also
was given to the defendant and his guardians personally
in Utah. The guardians by order of the Utah court
appeared and asked for the appointment of a guardian ad
litem, which -was made, and an answer and cross petition
praying for affirmative relief were filed. Lawyers were
refained and paid out of the defendant's estate by order
of the Utah court. There were various proceedings,
the end of which was that the plaintiff was appointed
administrator.de bonis non, the cross petition was denied,
and it was decreed that the defendant was indebted to
the estate for $1S,220,473.41. The defendant being entitled to one-fourth of the above sum as residuary legatee,
he was declared liable for $915,355.08 and ordered to
pay it overwithin sixty days to the Michigan Trust Company, The defendant also had been appointed by the
same court executor under his mother's will and ,after
proceedings like those that we have described was de-

Opinion of the Court.

clared liable for $16,458.81, which too he was ordered
to pay to the plaintiff within sixty days.
Ordinarily jurisdiction over a person is based on the
power of the sovereign asserting it to seize that person and
imprison him to await the sovereign's pleasure. But
when that power exists and is asserted by service at the
beginning of a cause, or if the party submits to the jurisdiction in whatever form may be required, we dispense
with the necessity of maintaining the physical power and
attribute the same force to the judgment or decree whether
the party remain within the jurisdiction or not. This is
one of the decencies of civilization that no one would dispute. It applies to Article IV, ยง 1, of the Constitution, so
that if a judicial proceeding is begun with jurisdiction
over the person of the party concerned it is within the
power of a State to bind him by every subsequent order
in the cause. Nations v. Johnson, 24 How. 195, 203, 204.
This is true not only of ordinary actions but of proceedings
like the present. It is within the power of a State to make
the whole administration of the estate a single proceeding,
to provide that one who has undertaken it within the
jurisdiction shall be subject to the order of -the court'in
the matter until the administration is closed by distribution, and, on the same principle, that he shall be required
to account for and distribute all that he receives, by the
order of the Probate Court.
The court below, admitting the power of the Michigan
court to adjudge the true state of the account of the
assets in the defendant's hands and to require him to
transfer them to his successor, denied its power to adjudge
him liable for assets converted to his own use and to decree
that he should pay the amount from his own property.
We believe that this is the law in some of the States;
United States v. Walker, 109 U. S. 258; but it is no less
well established in many that an executor must account
for all the property that has come to his hands, and the
VOL. ccxxvlii-23

228 U. S.

proceedings end with a decree that he pay over the sum
with whidh he is chargeable either to his successor or the
ultimate distributees, such a decree indeed being a condition precedent of the cumulative remedy on the bond.
Storer v. Storer, 6 Massachusetts, 390, 392, 393. Cobb v.
Kempton, 154 Massachusetts, 266, 269. Murray v. Wood,
144 Massachusetts, 195, 197. Probate Court v. Chapin,
31 Vermont, 373, 376. In Beall v. New Mexico, 16 Wall.
535, 540, it is recognized that some States have made it
the duty of an administrator who has been displaced to
account to the administrator de bonis non, and very many
decisions to that effect are cited correctly in 2 Woerner,
Adm., 2d ed., ยง 352, p. 748. Vide id., ยง536, pp. 1181, 1182.
As there can be no doubt of the power of the States to
give the larger scope to an account, which indeed is not
illogical in view of the fuller modern development of the
notion that an executor holds all the assets in a fiduciary
capacity, the only question in any case is what the State
has seen fit to do. Upon this question, courts of other
jurisdictions owe great deference to what the court concerned has done. It is a strong thing for another tribunal
to say that the local court did not know its own business
under its own laws. Even if no statute or decision of the
Supreme Court of the State is produced, the probability
is that the local procedure follows the traditions of the
place. Therefore we should feel bound to assume that
the Michigan decree was not too broad, in the absence of
statute or decision showing that it was wrong.
' But unless and until the Supreme Court of Michigan
shall decide otherwise we are of opinion that the Probate
Court was right. The statutes provide for charging an
executor in his account with the whole of the goods of the
deceased that come to his possession and with waste in
case of neglect to' pay over the money in his hands or of
loss to the persons interested. Liability on the bond is
stated as alternative. Compiled Laws, 1897, ยงยง 9428,

MICHIGAN TRUST CO. v. FERRY.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

9435. Compiled Laws, 1857, ยงยง 2977, 2984. It is said by
the Supreme Court that money received by an administrator and unjustifiably paid out is still in his hands in
contemplation of law, and that parties interested may
surcharge or falsify his account, Hall v. Grovier, 25 Michigan, 428, 432, 436; and again, that the assets of an estate
are not regarded as administered until they have been
collected and applied as required by law or the will of the
testator; until that time the jurisdiction of the Probate
Court remains. Lafferty v. People's Savings Bank, 76
Michigan, 35, 50. See farther Stevens v. Ottawa Probate
Judge, 156 Michigan, 526, 533, 534, arising out of this
case. In re Saier's Estate, 158 Michigan, 170, 173. In
short Michigan in a general way adopted the Massachusetts probate system, Campau v. Gillett, 1 Michigan,
416, 417, according to which assets are not administered
by being converted to the executor's own use, but must be
charged to him in his account. If the defendant properly
was charged in his account with all that came to his
hands and that was not distributed according to law, it
was within the power of the Probate Court to order him to
distribute that amount or to pay it to his successor in the
trust. Lafferty v. People's Savings Bank, 76 Michigan, 35,
71.
It follows from what we have said that a petition to the
Probate Court that the defendant be ordered to account
covered all his receipts as executor and that notice of the
petition was notice that the accounting would have that
scope. The decree upon the account was made with full
jurisdiction and apart from the insanity of the accountant
could be sued upon, Storer v. Storer, 6 Massachusetts, 390;
Cobb v. Kempton, 154 Massachusetts, 266, 269, and was entitled to full faith 'and credit elsewhere. Fitzsimmons v.
Johnson, 90 Tennessee, 614,428, 429,433. It is true that it
could not be enforced in Michigan while the defendant remained out of the State. But while the want of power to

Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

enforce a judgment or decree may afford a reason against
entertaining jurisdiction, Giles v. Harris,189 U. S. 475, 488,
it has nothing to do with the validity of a decree when
made. A decree in equity against a defendant who had left
the State after service upon him and had taken all his property vhith him would be entitled to full faith and credit
where he was found. The judgment of a court 'may be
complete and perfect and have full effect independent of
the right to issue execution.' Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch,
481, 485. Sep Kimball v. St. Louis & San FranciscoRy.
Co., 157 Massachusetts, 7, 8.
Jurisdiction is power, and the power of the Michigan
court was not affected by the insanity of Ferry. The
authority of the State to remove him and to require his
account to be settled at the same time remained, and
therefore, subject to any restrictions that might be imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment, it was for the State
to determin6 how he should be represented and what steps
:should be taken to protect his rights. As the jurisdiction
extended only to the cause and not to any independent
proceeding for guardianship, the orders made necessarily
were orders in the cause. 'But we do not perceive what
more could have been done to secure Ferry's rights. Still
less do we see any ground for declaring the decree invalid
because of the Fourteenth Amendment. The steps taken
were concurred in by the only courts that had anything
to say about it, the Utah court that controlled his person
and the-Michigan court that controlled the cause. On the
whole case our opinion is that the judgment should be
reversed.
Judgment reversed.
