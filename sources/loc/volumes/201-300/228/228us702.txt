ST. LOUIS, IRON MOUNTAIN & SOUTHERN RAILWAY. COMPANY v. HESTERLY, ADMINISTRATOR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.

No. 297.

Argued May 6, 1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

When the state court has overruled an objection that the Federal right
was not clearly presented, the objection is not open in this court.
Quwre, whether plaintiff can sue upon a statute of one jurisdiction when
the action can be maintained only on that of another.
In a suit for personal injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff's intestate, plaintiff sued an interstate carrier on two counts, one for
pecuniary loss to next of kin and the other for injury and pain sustained by the intestate before death. There was a recovery on both
counts which the Supreme Court of the State sustained on the
ground that the Employers' Liability Act was only supplementary
and the judgment could be upheld under the state law. Held error
and that:
In a suit for personal injuries against an interstate railway carrier, plaintiff, not defendant, has the election how the suit shall be
brought.
The Federal Employers' Liability Act supersedes state laws in
the matters with which it deals, including liability of carriers while
engaged in commerce between the States for defects of cars.
In case of death of an injured employ6, the only action under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act of 1908 is one for the benefit of
the next of kin; there can be no recovery for the pain suffered before death.
The Employers' Liability Act as amended in 1910 saves the rights of
the injured emplqy6 but allows only one recovery; the act as amended

not having a retroactive effect does not apply where the death occurred prior to the amendment.
98 Arkansas, 240, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 and the extent to which it
superseded state statutes, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. W. E. Hemingway, with whom Mr. Martin L.
Clardy and Mr. Thos. B. Pryor were on the brief, for
plaintiff in error.
Mr. Joseph M. Hill, Mr. James Brizzolara and Mr.
Henry L. Fitzhugh, for defendant in error, submitted.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the'opinion of the court.

This is an action for personal injuries resulting in the
death of the plaintiff's intestate. There are two counts, the
first for the. pecuniary loss to the next of kin, laid at
$5,000, the other for the injury and pain suffered by the
intestate, laid at $25,000. The death was caused by a
defect in a car on which the intestate was a brakeman, the
car being part of a train running from Van Buren, Arkansas, to Coffeyville, Kansas. The jury found a verdict for
the plaintiff for $2,000 on the first count and for $10,000
on the second. The Supreme Court of the State sustained
the judgment on condition of a remittitur of $5,000; this
was entered and judgment was rendered for $7,000. At
the trial the defendant asked for a ruling that the plaintiff
could not recover damages for pain under the second
count, which was denied subject to exception. The Supreme Court treated the request as intended to raise the
question whether the Employers' Liability Act of Congress of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, displaced the
state law, as undoubtedly it was; stated that the suit was

not based upon that act, and held that the act of Congress
was only supplementary, and that the judgment could
be upheld under the state law. 98 Arkansas, 240.
The plaintiff contends that the claim of right under the
law of the United States and against that under the law
of the State was not presented with clearness enough to
save it. But as the Supreme Court held the question sufficiently raised and decided it, that objection is not open
here. San Jos9 Land & Water Co. v. San Jos6 Ranch Co.,
189 U. S. 177, 180; Eau Claire Nat. Bank v. Jackman, 204
U. S. 522, 533.
The same answer may be given to the suggestion that
the defendant is estopped by having pleaded contributory
negligence and thus having relied upon the state law.
Moreover, the plaintiff, not the defendant, had the election how the suit should be brought, and as he relied upon
the state law, the defendant had no choice, if it was to
defend upon the facts. Whether the defendant could
have defeated the first count also on the ground that the
plaintiff was suing upon a statute of one jurisdiction,
whereas the action could be maintained only on that of
another, need not be decided, since the defendant asks
reversal of only so much of the judgment as rests on the
second count. Hence it is unnecessary to consider whether
the principle of Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wyler, 158 U. S.
285, or that of Missouri,Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf,
226 U. S. 570, 577, should be applied. See further Troxell
v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., 227 U. S.
434,442. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Slaght, 205 U. S. 122,
131. United States v. Dalcour, 203 U. S. 408, 423.
Coming to the merits it now is decided that the act of
Congress supersedes state laws in the matter with which
it deals. Mondou v. New York, New Haven & Hartford
R. R. Co., 223 U. S. 1, 53-55. Missouri,Kansas & Texas
Ry. Co. v. Wulf, 226 U. S. 570, 576. Michigan Central R.
R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 67. The act deals with

the liability of carriers, while engaged in commerce between the States, for defects in cars. Section 1. In the
case of death the only action is one for the benefit of the
next of kin. Section 1. Michigan Central R. R. Co. v.
Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 67, 68. American R. R. Co. v.
Didricksen,227 U. S. 145, 149. Gulf, Colorado & Santa F6
Ry. Co. v. Mcinnis, 228 U. S. 173, 175. Therefore the
ruling of the state court was wrong. The amendment of
April 5, 1910, c. 143, ยง 2, 36 Stat. 291, in like manner allows but one recovery, although it provides for survival of
the right of the injured person. The amendment, however, does not apply to this case, as the death occurred in
August, 1909.
Judgment reversed.

SANFORD v. AINSA, ADMINISTRATOR.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
ARIZONA.
No. 504.

Argued May 5, 1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

This court rarely disturbs local decisions of the territorial courts on
question of local practice.
The Supreme Court of the Territory, having held that undet ยง 10 of
Act 44 of 1899 of Arizona transferring cases from the District Court
of one county to the corresponding court of another county newly
organized, the former court retained jurisdiction until the conditions
of the transfer were fulfilled, this court follows that decision.
13 Arizona, 287, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
