Statement of the Case.

METROPOLIS

THEATRE COMPANY
OF CHICAGO.

v. CITY

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 181.

Argued March 12, 1913.-Decided April 7, 1913.

A classification of theatres for license fees based on, and graded according to, prices of admission is not arbitrary and unreasonable, even
though some of the theatres charging the higher admission may have
less revenue than those charging a smaller price of admission and
hence paying lower license fees; and so held that the Chicago theatre
license ordinance is not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law.
There is a natural relation between price of admission and revenue
that justifies a classification based ol the former.
This court will consider that a distinction between classes engaged
in the same business that obtains in all large cities must be a substantial basis for governmental action in classifying those engaged
in such business for taxation.
The fact that a law may be faulty does not demonstrate its invalidity
under the Federal Constitution; even though it may seem unjust
and oppressive it may be free from judicial interference.
Mere errors of government are not subject to judicial review by this
court; and only a palpably arbitrary exercise of authority can be
declared void under the Fourteenth Amendment.
246 Illinois, 20, affirmed.

BILL in equity brought in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, State of Illinois, to restrain the enforcement of
a certain ordinance of the city of Chicago, requiring
licenses for places of amusement. The ordinance divides
the places of amusement into twenty-one classes. The
entertainments offered by complainants fall within the
first class, which is defined as "all entertainments of a
theatrical, dramatic, vaudeville, variety or spectacular
character." The license fee is graded according to the
price of admission, exclusive of box seats, as follows:
If $1.00 or more, the fee is $1000; if it exceeds 50 cents

but is less than $1.00, $400; if it exceeds 30 cents but
is less than 50 cents, $300; if it exceeds 20 cents but not

more than 30 cents, $250; if it does not exceed 20 cents,
$200.
The foundation of the bill is that the ordinance, in so
far as it charges an annual license fee of $1000 upon
theatres charging $1.00 or more for any seat, exclusive
of box seats, violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States.
The city filed a demurrer to the bill, which was overruled, and, the city declining to plead further, a decree
was entered enjoining the enforcement of ยง 104 of the
ordinance. The decree was reversed by the Supreme
Court of the State and the case remanded with directions
to sustain the demurrer and dismiss the bill. This writ
of error was then sued out.
The bill describes the complainants as persons, firms
or corporations, and describes the theatres conducted
by each.of them as follows: The Colonial theatre, capacity
1482 seats; McVicker's theatre, 1868 seats; Illinois theatre,
1249 seats; Powers' theatre, 1115 seats; Studebaker
theatre, 1350 seats; Cort theatre, 962 seats; Grand Opera
House, 1379 seats, Great Northern theatre, 1205 seats;
LaSalle theatre, 770 seats; Princess theatre, 950; Chicago
Opera House, 1434 seats; Olympic theatre, 1532 seats;
Garrick theatre, 1259 seats; Whitney Opera House,
708 seats.
The following are the other pertinent facts: The theatres
cannot, under the ordinance, accommodate or grant admission to any number of persons in excess of the number
of the seats.
There have been given and produced at the theatres
respectively, excepting in the Cort theatre, for more than
two years last past, and in the Cort theatre for more
than two months last past, entertainments az d performances of the various kinds described in the ordinance,

METROPOLIS THEATRE CO. v. CHICAGO.

Statement of the Case.

and in some of the theatres the price of admission has not
exceeded $1.00 and in others it has not exceeded $2.00.
In some 'the minimum price of admission has been 50
cents and in some 25 cents. All the theatres, with the
exception of one or two, have at different times during
the last two years made, and intend in the future to make
different maximum and minimum prices of admission, dependent upon the location of seats and according to the
cost of production, the season of the year and. condition
of business. It is impossible to tell in qdvance the condition of business or the character of entertainment or
the highest or lowest prices of admission. At the present
time the highest price to some parts of each of the theatres
is $1.00 or over and the lowest price is much less. There
is not now and never has been any fixed rule or standard
among theatres in Chicago as to the number of seats in
any theatre for which an admission fee of $1.00 or over
is made. In some of the theatres owned and operated by
complainants, and in some theatres owned and operated
by others, there are more seats sold for more than $1.00
for a performance, than in others operated by complainants. The gross revenue per performance of complainants'
theatres and other theatres, if all of the seats were occupied
would differ and' vary according to the seating capacity
of the theatres, respectively, and also according to the
conditions -prevailing, including in the conditions 'the
charge made for admission, and the different prices of
admission to different parts of the theatres, there being
no theatres in Chicago wherein the prices of admission
to all parts of the theatre are identical with the prices
of admission charged for the same number of seats in any
other theatre.
The seating capacity of the largest theatre of complainants is 1868, and of the smallest, 708, the gross revenue
of the latter being, when fully occupied, less than $1000,
and of the former not more than $1500, figured on the

basis of' existing prices of admission to all parts of the
theatre. The largest theatre or place of amusement in
Chicago (the performance being of the kind described in
the ordinance and similar to those. given by complainants)
hks a seating capacity in excess of 4000, its highest price
.of admission is $1.00, and during many weeks of each
licensed period its gross revenue is in excess of $4000,
to-wit: $5000. And there are other theatres to which the
highest price of admission is less than $1.00, performances
in which are given twice a day, thereby increasing their
seating capacity; and the gross and 'net revenue thereof
is more than twice that of some of complainants' theatres.
In many other theatres, including those of complainants,
charging more than $1.00 for admission, eight performances only are given per week.
The complainants pay taxes upon their buildings and
personal property, and they have expended in excess of
$10,000 for the purpose of producing and giving entertainments of the kind described and in excess of $5000
in advertising. The good will and business of complainants are of great value, and if the theatres are not permitted to continue as places of amusements a large part
of the investment of complainants will be destroyed and
they will suffer great and irreparable damage, and in an
amount which cannot be adequately ascertained or compensated in an action at law.
The business of complainants is lawful and their theatres
have been approved by the authorities of the city and have
conformed in every particular to the ordinance of the city.
On December 17, 1909, an ordinance was passed which
the officers of the city threatened to enforce against complainants, whereupon a suit was brought by the latter
and Others to enjoin the same upon the grounds, among
others, that its provisions were discriminatory. The
ordinance in controversy was then passed.
There are theatres in Chicago other than those of com-

plainants with various seating capacities which, under the
ordinance of December 17, 1909, were obliged to pay a
license fee of $1000, but which under the ordinance in
controversy are required to pay only $400.
The income obtained by theatres of the second, third
and fourth classes of the amended ordinance is often
largely in excess of the income obtained by those of the
first class, and there are and for a long time have been
given entertainments at which large assemblages of persons
congregate and to which no admission fee is charged.
Complainants intend to give entertainments at their
theatres and have refused to pay the license required by
the ordinance, and, as such theatres are not impressed
with a public use, the city has no right to designate the
amount to be charged as admission thereto.
Many causes of action are threatened against complainants and many of their managers and officers.
Theatres and places of amusement in Chicago have paid
a license fee starting at $100, in 1881, and progressively
increasing during certain periods to January 1, 1910,
when it was fixed at $500, and complainants paid the
license fee exacted during the several periods.
The inspection and regulation of complainants' theatres
do not cost the city more than $50 per year.
The other provisions of the bill set forth in other ways
what is alleged to be the discriminatory character of the
ordinance arising from basing the license fee upon the
price of admission and an infringement of the constitution
of the State of Illinois and of the United States is charged.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court, after making the above statement.

The attack of complainants (we so call plaintiffs in error)
is upon the classification of the ordinance. It is contended
that the purpose of the ordinance is to raise revenue and
that its classification has no relation to such purpose and
therefbre is arbitrarily discriminatory, and thereby offends
the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. The character. ascribed to the ordinance
by the Supreme Court of the State is not-without uncertainty. But we may assume, as complainants assert, that
the court considered the ordinance as a revenue measure
only. The court said:; "The ordinance may be sustainable
under the taxing power alone, without reference to its

METROPOLIS THEATRE CO. v. CHICAGO.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

reasonableness as a regulatory measure." And, regarding
it as a revenue measure, complainants attack it as unreasonable'in basing its classification upon the price of
admission of a particular theatre and not upon the revenue
derived therefrom; and to exhibit the discrimination which
is asserted to result, a comparison is made between the
seating capacity of complainants' theatres and the number
of their performances within given periods and the theatres
of others in the same respects and the resulting revenues.
But there are accidental circumstances and dependent,
as the Supreme Court of the State said, upon the advantages of the particular theatre or choice of its owner, and
not determined by the ordinaiice. It will immediately
occur upon the most casual reflection that the distinction
the theatre itself makes is not artificial and must have
some relation to the success and ultimate profit of its
business. In other words, there is natural relation between the price of admission and revenue, some advantage
certainly that determines the choice. The distinction
obtains in every large city of the country. The reason for
it must therefore be substantial, and if it be so universal
in the practice of the business it would seem not unreasonable if it be adopted as the basis of governmental action.
If the action of government have such a basis it cannot be
declared to be so palpably arbitrary as to be repugnant
to the Fourteenth Amendment. This is the test of its
validity, as we have so many times said. We need not
cite the cases. It is enough to say that we have tried, so
far as that Amendment is concerned, to declare in words,
and the cases illustrate by examples, the wide range which
legislation has in classifying its objects. To be able to
find fault with a law is not to demonstrate its invalidity.
It may seem unjust and oppressive, yet be free from
judicial interference. The problems of government are
practical ones and may justify, if they do not require,
rough accommodations-illogical, it may be, and un-
