McDERMOTT v. STATE OF WISCONSIN.
GRADY v. SAME.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WISCONSIN.
Nos. 112, 113.

Argued January 17, 20, 1913.-Decided April 7, 1913.

State legislation in regard to labeling articles in interstate commerce
which are required to be branded under the Federal Pure Food and
Drugs Act, is void so far as it interferes with the provisions of such
act and imposes a burden on interstate commerce; and so held as to
certain provisions of the Wisconsin statute.
Congress not only has the right to pass laws regulating legitimate
commerce among the States and with foreign nations, but also has
full power to bar from the channels of such commerce illicit and
harmful articles.
Congress may itself determine the means appropriate to this purpose;
and, so long as they do no violence to the other provisions of the
Constitution, Congress is itself the judge of the means to be employed in exercising the powers conferred on it in this respect.
The Pure Food and Drugs Act must be construed in the light of the
purpose and power of Congress to exclude poisonous and adulterated
food from interstate commerce. Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States,
220 U. S. 45.
Articles, the shipment or delivery of which in interstate commerce is
prohibited by § 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, are those which are
adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act in the
light of those provisions of the act wherein adulteration and misbranding are defined.
"Package" or its equivalent, as used in § 7 of the Food and Drugs Act,
refers to the immediate container of the article which is intended for
consumption by the public. To limit the requirements of the act
to the outside box which is not seen by the purchasing public would
render nugatory one of the principal provisions of the act.
Qumre, and not necessary to decide in thi%case, what is the exact meaning of the terms "original unbroken package" and "broken package" as used in §§ 2, 3 and 10 of the Food and Drugs Act.
While the enactment by Congress of the Food and Drugs Act does not

prevent the State from making regulatIons, not in conflict therewith,
to protect its people against fraud or imposition by impure food and
drugs, Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, the State may not, under the
guise of exercising its police power, impose burdens upon interstate
commerce or enact legislation in conflict with the act of Congress on
the subject.
A state law on a subject within the domain of Congress must yield to
the superior power of Congress; to the extent that it interferes with or
frustrates the operation of the act of Congress a state statute is void.
Whether articles in interstate commerce have been branded in accordance with the terms of the Food and Drugs Act is not for the
State to determine but for the Federal courts in the maner indicated by Congress.
As the Federal Food and Drugs Act requires articles in interstate
commerce to be properly labeled, a State cannot require a label when
properly affixed under that statute to be removed and other labels
authorized by its own statute to be affixed to the package containing
the article so long as it remains unsold by the importer, whether it be
in the original case or not.
The doctrine of original packages was not intended to limit the right
of Congress, when it chose to assert it, as it has done in the Food and
Drugs Act, to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from
the carriage of injurious or fraudulently branded articles and to
choose appropriate means to that end.
State legislation cannot impair legislative means provided by Congress
in a Federal statute for the enforcement thereof.
The statute of Wisconsinof 1907 prescribing a label for corn syrup and
prohibiting all others is invalid so far as it relates to articles properly
branded on the immediate container thereof under the Federal Food
and Drugs Act and brought into the State in interstate commerce,
so long as they remain unsold by the importer, whether in the original
outside package or not.
143 Wisconsin, 18, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
Wisconsin syrup law and the construction of the Federal
Pure Food and Drug law, are stated in the opinion.

228 U. S.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

Butler, Mr. William R. Curkeet and Mr. Burr W. Jones
were on the brief, for defendant in error:
The Wisconsin act of 1907, is not invalid because in
violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution or of the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906.
In the absence of congressional action otherwise indicating, an article ceases to be the subject of interstate
commerce, and becomes subject to the police power of the
State, when the original package in which it is usually, and
in good faith shipped, has been received and broken by
the importer, or' when he has made the first sale thereof,
in the original package so received. Cook v. Marshall
County, 196 U. S. 261; Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343;
May v. New Orleans, 178 U. S. 496; Sponge Co. v. Drug Co.,
124 Wisconsin, 469.
The mere fact that Congress, in the exercise of its power
to regulate commerce, has legislated upon the general
subject of the transportation and sale of an article of
interstate commerce, does not, in itself, take away the
right of the State, in the exercise of its police power, to
make regulations concerning the same article as a subject of interstate commerce, at least so long as such
state regulations do not conflict with the Federal regulation.
Congressional regulation does not exclude state regulation except so far as the former, lawfully exercised, conflicts with the latter. Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S. 137;
Asbell v. Kansas, 209 U. S. 251; Crossman v. Lurman, 192
U. S. 189; State v. C., M. & St. P. Ry. Co., 136 Wisconsin,

Southern R. Co. v. Reid, 222 U. S. 424, 442; Savage v.
Jones, 225 U. S. 501.
The act of 1906 does not expressly or impliedly operate upon the original package of commerce, after it has
been broken, or after its first sale as such by the importer,
but on the contrary, the act clearly shows the congressional intention to leave the article subject to state regulation after it has so ceased to be the subject of interstate
commerce; and, therefore, there is no conflict between
the Federal act and the state law.
The terms "original, unbroken package" as used in
§§ 2 and 10 of the act, and "unbroken package" as used
in § 3 of the act, had prior to its adoption been judicially
treated as synonymous. Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29;
United States v. Fox, Fed. Cas. No. 15155.
Where a party, in transporting goods from one State
to another, selects an unusual method for the express
purpose of evading or defying the police laws of the latter
State, the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution
and an act of Congress cannot be invoked as a cover for
fraudulent dealings. Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343.
An original package within the meaning of the Food and
Drugs Act is the unit, complete in itself, delivered by the
shipper to the carrier addressed to the consignee, and received by him in the identical condition in which it was
sent, without separation of the contents in any manner.
Thornton, Foods and Drugs, p. 971.
The foregoing was the judicially accepted definition of
"original package," "original, unbroken package," and
"unbroken package," at the time of the adoption of the act
of 1906. Brown v.. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Low v.

Under the principles here announced-and they have
frequently been applied by this court-there should be no
difficulty in sustaining this act, even though the language
is broad enough to include both interstate and intrastate
commerce. It cannot be said that the idea of controlling
interstate commerce was even present to the mind of the
legislature, much less that it was the controlling inducement to the passage of the act for the purpose of controlling commerce within the State. Berea College v. Kentucky,

The Federal act is not to be construed as displacing
state authority to regulate the adulteration or branding
of foods which have been shipped from without the State,
and thereby become subject to the Federal law, but which
have been removed from the original package of shipment.
Armour & Co. v. Bird, 123 N. W. Rep. 580 (Dec., 1909);
Savage v. Scovell, 171 Fed. Rep. 566 (1908).
A ,construction of the act of 1906, which would make
it operate upon the contents of the original package of
shipment or upon such original package after its first
sale by the importer, would render the act, thus far at
least, invalid, as an unconstitutional invasion by Congress
of the power reserved to the States to regulate their own
internal affairs.
The regulation.of the internal affairs of a State by Congress is as unconstitutional as is the direct attempt by a
State to regulate interstate commerce. Ill. Cent. R. R. V.

Whether the statute in question shall be construed to
be applicable to intrastate commerce solely, or not, is
purely a question for the state court, and upon the proper
construction to be given, the statq courts are not restricted
by Federal decisions. In such cases the Federal courts
adopt the construction given by the state courts. Osborne:

The'Wisconsin statute in no way violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
The act in question falls clearly within the police power
of the State, and as such should be sustained. It is only.
when the bounds of reason have been so clearly exceeded
as to violate some constitutional prohibition, express or
implied, that, the- court has any power to interfere with
the exercise of this legislative power. State v. Redmon,

products as well as to the securing of wholesomeness in
such products'. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has, in
a number of cases, laid down the rule that the legislature,
in the exercise of its police power, may legislate as to all
matters appertaining to the lives, limbs, health, comfort,
good morals, peace and safety of society. Baker v. State,

The police power of the State is not limited to regulations necessary for the preservation of good order or the
public health and safety. The prevention of fraud and
deceit, cheating, and imposition are equally within the
power. People v. Freeman, 242 Illinois, 373; People v.

The provision of the Federal Constitution, invoked by
the defendants, was not designed to interfere with the
exercise of the police power by the States, and it has not
shorn the States of their power to regulate trades and
occupations so as to guard against injury to the public,
and to prevent deception and fraud in the manufacture
and sale of food product's. See in addition to cases cited

The claim that the article in question cannot be sold

is unfounded.
MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court,
The plaintiffs in error, George McDermott and T. H.
Grady, were severally convicted in the Circuit Court of
Dane County, in the State of Wisconsin, upon complaints
made against them by an Assistant Dairy and Food

McDERMOTT v. WISCONSIN.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Commissioner of that State for the violation of a statute
of Wisconsin relating to the sale of certain articles and
for the protection of the public health. The convictions
Were affirmed by the decision of the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin. 143 Wisconsin, 18.
The complaint against McDermott charged that on
March 2, 1908, at Oregon, in Dane County, he "did unlawfully have in his possession with intent to sell, and
did offer and expose for sale and did sell, a certain article,
product, compound and mixture composed of more than
seventy-five per cent. glucose and less than twenty-five
per cent. of cane syrup, said cane syrup being then and
there mixed with said glucose, and that the can containing
said compound and mixtue was then and there- unlawfully branded and labeled 'Karo Corn Syrup' and was
then and there further unlawfully branded and labeled
'10% Cane Syrup, 90% Corn Syrup,' contrary to the
statute in such case made and provided." As to Grady,
the complaint was similar to that against McDermott
except that the label designated the mixture as "Karo
Corn Syrup with Cane Flavor" and added "Corn Syrup,
85%." The statute of Wisconsin for the violation of
which -plaintiffs in error were convicted is found in Laws
of Wisconsin for 1907, § 4601 at page 646, being chapter 557, and the pertinent parts of it are as follows:
"Section 1. . . .
No person,
.
by himself

.

. or agent

shall sell, offer or ex-

....

pose for sale or have in his possession with intent to sell
any syrup, maple syrup, sugar-cane syrup, sugar syrup,
refiners' syrup, sorghum syrup or molasses, mixed with
)glucose, unless the barrel, cask, keg, can, pail or other
original container, containing the same be distinctly
branded or labeled so as to plainly show the true name of
each and all of the ingredients composing such mixture, as
follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
, Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

"Third. In case such mixture shall contain glucose in a
proportion exceeding 75 per cent. by weight, it shall be labeled and sold as 'Glucose flavored with Maple Syrup,'
'Glucose flavored with Sugar-cane Syrup,'
'Glucose flavored with Refiners' Syrup'
as
the case may be. The labels . . . shall bear the
name and address of the manufacturer or dealer. .
.
In all mixtures in which glucose is used in the proportion
of, more than 75 per cent. by weight, the name of the
syrup or. molasses which .is mixed with the glucose for
flavoring purposes and the words showing that. said
syrup or.molasses is used as a flavoring, as provided in
this section, shall be printed on the label of each container
of such mixture. . . . The mixtures or syrups designated in t! is section shall have no other designation or
brand than herein required that represents or is the name
of any article which contains a saccharine substance;
, nor shall any of the" aforesaid glucose, syrups,
molasses or mixtures contain any substance injurious
to health, nor any other article or substance otherwise
prohibited by law in articles of food."
The facts are that the plaintiffs in error were retail
merchants in Oregon, Dane County, Wisconsin; that
before the filing of the complaints against them each
had bought for himself for resale as such merchant from
wholesale grocers in Chicago and had receiveql by rail
from that city twelve half gallon tin cans or pails of the
articles designated in the complaints, each Shipment
being made in wooden boxes containing the cans, and
that when the goods were received at their stores the respective plaintiffs in error took tlie cans from the boxes,
placed them on the shelves for sale at retail, and destroyed
the boxes in which the goods were shipped to them, as
was, customary in such cases. From their nature, the
articles thus canned and offered to be sold, instead of
being labeled as they were, if labeled in accordance with

McDERMOTT v. WISCONSIN.

Opinion of the Court.

the state law, would have been branded with the words
"Glucose flavored with Refiner's Syrup,", and, as the
statute provides that the mixtures or syrups offered for
sale shall have upon them no designation or brand which
represents or contains the name of a saccharine substance
other than that required by the state law, the labels upon
the cans must be removed, if the state authority is recognized.
Plaintiffs in error contend that the cans were labeled
in accordance with the Food and Drugs Act passed by
Congress, June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 768, c. 3915, and that
that fact is evidenced by the decision of the Secretaries
of the Treasury, Agriculture and Commerce and Labor
made under the claimed authority of that act, which is
as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C., February 13, 1908.
"We have each given careful consideration to the labeling, under the Pure Food Law, of the thick, viscous
syrup obtained by the incomplete hydrolysis of the starch
of corn, and composed essentially of dextrose, maltose
and dextrin. In our opinion it is lawful to label this
syrup as corn syrup, and if to the corn syrup there is
added - a small percentage of refiner's syrup, a product
of cane; the mixture in our judgment is not misbranded
if labeled 'corn syrup with cane flavor.'
George B. Cortelyou, Secretary of the Treasury.
James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture.
Oscar H- Strauss, Secretary of Commerce and Labor."

And it is insisted that the Federal Food and Drugs Act
passed-under the authority of the Constitution has taken
possession of this field of regulation and that the state
act is a wrongful interference with the exclusive power
of Congress over interstate commerce, in which, it appears,
the gobds in question were shipped. The case present .

among other questions, the constitutional question
whether the state act in permitting the sale of this article
only when labeled according to the state law is open to
the objection just indicated.
That Congress has ample power in this connection is
no longer open to question. That body has the right
not only to pass laws which shall regulate legitimate
commerce among the States and with foreign nations,
but has full power to keep the channels of such commerce
free from the transportation of illicit or harmful articles,
to make such as are injurious to the public health outlaws
of such commerce and to bar them from the facilities
and privileges thereof. Congress may itself determine
the means appropriate to this purpose, and so long as
they do no violence to other provisions of the Constitution it is itself the judge of the means to be employed in
exercising the powers conferred upon it in this respect.

U. S. 45; Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308.
The Food and Drugs Act was passed by Congress,
under its authority to exclude from interstate commerce
impure and adulterated food and drugs and to prevent
the facilities of such commerce being used to enable such
articles to be transported throughout the country from
their place of manufacture to the people who consume
and use them, and it is in the light of the purpose and of
the power exerted in its passage by Congress that this act
must be considered and construed. Hipolite Egg Co. v.
United States, supra.
Section 2 of the act provides that "the introduction
into any State or Territory or the District of Columbia
from any other State or Territory or the District of
Columbia . . . of any article of food or drugs which
is adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of
this Act, is hereby prohibited; and any person who shall

228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ship or deliver for shipment from any State or Territory
or the District of Columbia to any other State or Territory or the District of Columbia . .
any such
article so adulterated or misbranded within the meaning
of this Act, . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
and for such offense be fined," etc. The article of food
or drugs, the shipment or delivery for shipment in interstate commerce of which is prohibited and punished, is
such as is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning
of the act. What it is to adulterate or misbrand food or
drugs within the meaning of the act requires a consideration of its other provisions, wherein such adulteration
or misbranding is defined.
According to the terms of § 7 drugs are "adulterated"
where, if they are sold under a name recognized in the
United States Pharmacopoeia and differ from the standard
of strength therein laid down, the standard of strength,
etc., is not plainly stated upon the bottle, box, or other
container; and food is "adulterated" where it contains
an added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient
which may render it injurious, except that, where directions are printed on the covering or the package for the
necessary removal of such preservative, the provisions of
the act shall apply only when the food is ready for consumption. Turning to § 8, we find that the term "misbranded," as used in the statute, shall apply to all drugs
or articles of food, the package or label of Which shall bear
any statement, design or device regarding such article, or
the ingredients or substances contained therein, which is
false or misleading in any particular, and to any food or
drug product which is falsely branded as to the State, etc.,
in which it was manufactured; and in the case of drugs it
is provided that, if the contents of the package as originally
put up shall have been removed in whole or in part and
other contents placed in such package, or, if the package
fail to bear a statement on the label as required, the drugs
VOL. ccxxvuI-9

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.,
Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

shall be deemed misbranded; and as to food, if it shall be
labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead a purchaser
or purport to be a foreign product when not so, or, if the
contents of the package as originally put up shall have
been removed in whole or in part and other contents
placed in such package, or, if the package fail to bear a
statement on the label as required, or, if in package form
and the contents are stated in terms of weight or measure
and they are not plainly and correctly stated on the outside of the package, or, if the package, containing it or its
label contain any design or device regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein which are false
or misleading in character, the food shall be deemed misbranded.
That the word "package" or its equivalent expression,
as used by Congress in sections 7 and 8 in defining what
shall constitute adulteration and what shall constitute
misbranding within the meaning of the act, clearly refers to the immediate container of the article which is
intended for consumption by the public, there can be no
question. And it is sufficient, for the decision of these
cases, that we consider the extent of the word package as
thus used only, and we therefore have no occasion, and
do not attempt, to decide what Congress included in the
terms "original unbroken package" as used in the second
and tenth sections and "unbroken package ' in the third
section. Within the limitations of its right to regulate
interstate commerce, Congress manifestly is Aiming at the
contents of the package as it shall reach the consumer, for
whose protection the act was .primarily passed, and it is
the branding upon the package which contains the article
intended for consumption itself which is the subjectmatter of regulation. Limiting the Tequirements of the
act as to adulteration and misbranding simply to the' outside wrapping or box containing the packages intended to
be purchased-by the consumer, so that the importer, by

McDERMOTT v. WISCONSIN.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

removing and destroying such covering, could prevent
the operation of the law on the imported article yet unsold, would render the act nugatory and its provisions
wholly inadequate to accomplish the purposes for which
it was passed.
The object of the statute is to prevent the misuse of the
facilities of interstate commerce in conveying to and placing before the consumer misbranded and adulterated articles of medicine or food, and in order that its protection
may be afforded to those who are intended to receive its
benefits the brands regulated must be upon the packages
intended to reach the purchaser. This is the only practical
or sensible construction of the act, and, for the reasons we
have stated, we think the requirements of the act as so construed clearly within the powers of Congress over the facilities of interstate commerce, and such has been the construction generally placed upon the act by the Federal courts.

While these regulations are within the power of Congress, it by no means follows that the State is not permitted
to make regulations, with a view to the protection of its
people against fraud or imposition by impure food or
drugs. This subject was fully considered by this court in
Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, in which the power of the
State to make regulations concerning the same subjectmatter, reasonable in their terms and not in conflict with
the acts of Congress, was recognized and stated, and certain regulations of the State of Indiana were held not to be
inconsistent with the Food and Drugs Act of Congress.
While this is true, it is equally well settled that the State

228 U. S.

may not, under the guise of exercising its police power or
otherwise, impose burdens upon or discriminate against
interstate commerce, nor may it enact legislation in conflict with the statutes of Congress passed for the regulation
of the subject, and if it does, to the extent that the state
law interferes with or frustrates the operation of the acts
of Congress, its provisions must yield to the superior
Federal power given to Congress by the Constitution.

Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1; Savage v. Jones,
supra, 533.
Having in view the interpretation we have given the
Food and Drugs Act and applying the doctrine just
stated to the instant cases, how does the matter stand?
When delivered for shipment and when received through
the channels of interstate commerce the cans in question
bore'brands or labels which were supposed to comply
with the requirements of the act of Congress. Whether
the Secretaries had the power under the Food and Drugs
Act to make the regulation set out above is not now before
-us. It is enough for the present purpose to say that, so for
as this record discloses, it was undertaken in good faith
to label the articles in compliance with the act of Congress,
and, if they were not so labeled, by § 2 provision is made for
the enforcement of the act by criminal prosecution and
by § 10 by proceedings in rem. Whether the labels complied with the Federal law was not for the State to determine, This was a matter provided for by the act of
Congress and to be determined as therein indicated by
proper proceedings in the Federal courts.
The label upon the unsold article is in the one case the
evidence of the shipper that he has complied with the act
of Congress, while in the other, by its misleading and false
chaxacter, it furnishes the proof upon which the Federal

McDERMOTT v. WISCONSIN.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

authorities depend to reach and punish the shipper and
to condemn the goods. If truly labeled within the meaning
of the act his goods are immune from seizure by Federal
authority; if the label is false or misleading within the
terms of the law the goods may be seized and condemned.
In other words the label is the means of vindication or the
basis of punishment in determining the character of the
interstate shipment dealt with by Congress. While in
this situation, the goods being unsold, as a condition of
their legitimate sale within the State' and also of their
being in the possession of the importer for the purpose of
sale and of being exposed and offered for sale by him, the
Wisconsin statute provides that they shall bear the label
required by the state law and none other (which represents
a saccharine substance, as do the ]abels in these cases).
In other words, it is essential to a legal exercise of possession of and traffic in such goods under the state law that
labels which presumably meet with the requirements of
the Federal law and for the determination of the correctness of which. Congress has provided effectual means, shall
be removed from the packages before the first sale by the
finporter. In this connection it might be noted that as a
practical matter, at least, the first time the opportunity
of inspection by the Federal authorities arises in cases
like the present is when the goods, after having been manufactured, put up in package form and boxed in one State
and having been transported in interstate commerce,
arrive at their destination, are delivered to the consignee,
unboxed, and placed by him upon the shelves of his store
for sale. Conceding to the State the authority to make
regulations consistent with the Federal law for the further
protection of its citizens against impure and misbranded
food and drugs, we think to permit such regulation as is
embodied in this statute is to permit a State to discredit
and burden legitimate Federal regulations of interstate
commerce, to destroy rights arising out of the Federal

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

statute which have accrued both to the Government and
the shipper, and to impair. the effect of a Federal law which
has been enacted under the Constitutional power of Congress over the subject.
To require the removal or destruction before the goods
are sold of the evidence which Congress has, by the Food
and Drugs Act, as we shall see, provided may be examined
to determine the compliance or noncompliance with the
regulations of the Federal law, is beyond the power of
the State. The Wisconsin act which permits the sale of
articles subject to the regulations of interstate commerce
only upon condition that they contain the exclusive labels
required by the statute is an act in excess of its legitimate
power.
It is insisted, however, that, since at the time when the
state act undertook to regulate the branding of these goods,
namely, when in the possession of the plaintiffs in error
and held upon their shelves for sale, the cans had been
removed from the boxes in which they were shipped in
interstate commerce, they had therefore passed beyond
the jurisdiction of Congress, and their regulation was
exclusively a matter for state legislation. This assertion
is based upon the original package doctrine as it is said
to have been laid down in the former decisions of this
court. The term "original package " had its origin in
Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, in which this court had
to consider the extent of the protection given under Federal authority to articles imported into this country from
abroad for sale, and it was there held that (p. 441):
"When the importer has so acted upon the thing
imported, that it 'has become incorporated and mixed
up with the mass of property in the country, it has,
perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and
has become subject to the taxing power of the State;
butr-while remaining the property of the importer, in his
warehouse, in the original form or package in which it

McDERMOTT v. WISCONSIN.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the Constitution."
That doctrine has*been many times applied in the decisions of this court in defining the line of demarcation
which shall separate the Federal from the state authority
where the sovereign power of the Nation or State is
involved in dealing with property. And where it has been
found necessary to decide the boundary of Federal authority it has been generally held that, where goods prepared and packed for shipment in interstate commerce are
transported in such commerce and delivered to the consignee and the package by him separated into its component parts, the power of Federal regulation has ceased
and that of the State may be asserted. Some of the cases
in which this doctrine has been considered will be found
in the margin.' In the view, however, which we take of
this case it is unnecessary to enter upon any extended
consideration of the nature and scope of the principles
involved in determining what is an original package.
For, as we have said, keeping within its Constitutional
limitations of authority, Congress may determine for
itself the character of the means necessary to make its
purpose effectual in preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of articles of a harmful character, and
to this end may provide the means of inspection, examination and seizure necessary to enforce the prohibitions of the
act, and when § 2 has been violated the Federal authority,
in enforcing either § 2 or § 10, may follow the adulterated
or misbranded article at least to the shelf of the importer.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

Congress having made adulterated and misbranded
articles contraband of interstate commerce, in the manner
we have already pointed out, provides in § 10 of the act
that such articles may be proceeded against and seized
for confiscation and condemnation while being transported
from one State, Territory, district, or insular possession
to another for sale, or, having been transported, remaining
"unloaded, unsold, or in original unbroken packages,"
and the subsequent provisions of the section regulate the
disposition of the articles seized. To make the provisions
of the act effectual, Congress has provided not only for
the seizure of the goods while being actually transported
in interstate commerce, but has also provided for such
seizure after such transportation and while the goods remain "unloaded, unsold, or in original unbroken packages."
The opportunity for inspection en route may be very inadequate. The real opportunity of Government inspection may only arise when, as in the present case, the goods
as packed have been removed from the outside box in
which they were shipped and remain, as the act provides, "unsold." It is enough, by the terms of the act,
if the articles are unsold, whether in original packages
or not. Bearing in mind the authority of Congress to
make effectual regulations to keep impure or misbranded
articles out of the channels of interstate commerce, we
think the provisions of § 10 are clearly within its power.
Indeed it seems evident that they are measures essential to the accomplishment of the purpose of the
act.
The doctrine of original packages had its origin in the
opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in Brown v. Maryland,
already referred to. It was intended to protect the importer in the right to sell the imported goods which was
the real object and purpose of importation. To determine
the time when an article passes out of interstate into
state jurisdiction for the purpose of taxation is entirely

BOGART v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY. 137

Syllabus.

different from deciding when an article which has violated a Federal prohibition becomes immune. The doctrine was not intended to limit the right of Congress,
now asserted, to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from the carriage of injurious or fraudulently
branded articles and to choose appropriate means to
that end. The legislative means provided in the Federal
law for its own enforcement may not be thwarted by
state legislation having a direct effect to impair the effectual exercise of such means.
For the reasons stated, the statute of Wisconsin, in
forbidding all labels other than the one it prescribed, is
invalid, and it follows that the judgments of the state
court affirming the convictions of the plaintiffs in error
for selling the articles in question without the exclusive
brand required by 1le State, must be
Reversed, and the cases are remanded to the state court for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
