EVERETT, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF JUDSON, v. JUDSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPLALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 595.

Argued March 13, 1913.-Decided Ar dl 28, 1913.

Burlingham v. Crouse, ante, p. 459, followed to effec that under § 70a
of the Bankruptcy Act the trustee only takes furrender value of
insurance policies on the bankrupt's life, or, in case loans have been
made by the company issuing the policies, only the excess of surrender value over the amount of the loan.
Under § 70a of the Bankruptcy Act the bankrupt is entitled to the
policy by paying the amount of the cash surrender value or excess
thereof over loans as of the date of the filing of the petition, and in
case of the maturity of the policy before the adjudication he or his
legal representative is entitled to the proceeds of the policy over
and above such amount.
Congress, by the proviso in § 70a, fixed the date of filing the petition
as the line of cleavage as between the trustee and the bankrupt in
regard to life insurance policies, and this is not affected by subsequent events such as the maturity of the policy by the suicide of the
bankrupt, even though prior to adjudication.

JUSTICE

DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case involves the title to the proceeds of certain
insurance policies upon the life of Alfred M. Judson,
bankrupt, deceased, collected by the trustee in bankruptcy. The executor of Judson's estate brought suit
against the trustee in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, asserting title to such
funds. The District Court ordered that the proceeds of
the policies, less their cash surrender value, be paid to the
executor (188 Fed. Rep. 702); the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit, upon petition to revise, affirmed
that order (192 Fed. Rep. 834), and the case comes here
on certiorari.

EVERETT v. JUDSON.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

A petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against
the firm of Judson & Judson and its members, Alfred M.
Judson being one, on December 17, 1910, and on December 23, 1910, Judson entered a notice of his appearance in
the proceedings. On January 9, 1911, the firm and its
members were adjudged bankrupts, and on February 9,
1911, Everett qualified as trustee. Judson owned certain
life insurance policies, at the time of the institution of the
bankrupt proceedings, and thereafter and until his death
payable to his executors, administrators or assigns. So
far as this case is concerned, at the time of the filing of the
petition in bankruptcy, these policies, with cash surrender
values and subject to loans, were as follows: One policy
for $5,000, having a cash surrender value of $2,291.49 and
subject to a loan of $2,238; another for $1,000, having a
cash surrender value of $332.31 and subject to a loan of
$322; and another for $10,000, having a cash surrender
value of $5,030 and subject to a loan of $5,240. It therefore appears that the cash surrender value of the policies on
December 17, 1910, was $63.80.
On January 4, 1911, Judson committed suicide. Notice
was served on the trustee that the executor claimed the
right, under § 70a of the Bankruptcy Act to pay to the
trustee the cash surrender value of the policies when
ascertained, but the trustee denied such right and also the
right of the executor to the balance of the proceeds of
the policies. Under agreement, the insurance companies
paid to the trustee $8,675.14 upon the policies. The
executor asserted title to the difference between the sum
realized on the policies and the cash surrender value,
namely, $8,611.34. The District Court, upon the authority of Burlingham v. Crouse, 181 Fed. Rep. 479, held'that
the proceeds of the policies, over and above the cash surrender value as of the date of the filing of the petition,
passed to the executor. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the order of the District Court, holding that the

time when the interest of the bankrupt estate in the
policies passed to the trustee was the date of the filing of
the petition, •and further, also upon the authority of
Burlingham v. Crouse, 181 Fed. Rep. 479, that the interest
of the trustee in the policies extended only to their cash
surrender value.
The present case was argued at the same time as the case
of Burlingham v. Crouse, ante, p. 459, and in so far as it is
like that case the principles therein laid down are controlling. - The present case has, however, a feature not
directly involved in the case of Burlingham v. Crouse,
because Judson, the insured, committed suicide before the
adjudication in bankruptcy, although after the filing of
the petition, and it is the contention of the petitioner that
the Bankruptcy Act vested the title to the property in the
trustee as of the time of the adjudication and that the
death of the bankrupt between the filing of the petition
and the date of the adjudication made the proceeds of the
policies-assets in the hands of the trustee.
While it is true that § 70a provides that the trustee,
upon his appointment and qualification, becomes vested
by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt as of the
date he was adjudged a bankrupt, there are other provisions of the statute which, we think, evidence the intention to vest in the trustee the title to such property as it
was at the time of the filing of the petition. This subject
was considered in Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber
Co., 222 UI. S. 300, wherein it was held that, pending the
bankrupt proceedings and after the filing of the petition,
no creditor could obtain by attachment a lien upon the
property which would defeat the general purpose of the
law to dedicate the property to all creditors alike. Section 70a vests all the property in the trustee, which, prior
to the filing of the petition, the bankrupt could by any
means have transferred or which might have been levied
upon and sold under judicial process against him. The

Syllabus.

bankrupt's discharge is from all provable debts and claims
which existed on the day on which the petition for adjudication was filed. Zavelo v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625, 630-1.
The schedule that the bankrupt is required to file, showing
the location and value of his property, must be filed with
his petition.
We think that the purpose of the law was to fix the line
of cleavage with reference to the condition of the bankrupt
estate as of the time at which the petition was filed and
that the property which vests in the trustee at the time of
adjudication is that which the bankrupt owned at the
time of the filing of the petition. And it is as of that date
that the surrender value of the insurance policies mentioned in § 70a should be ascertained. The subsequent
suicide of the bankrupt before the adjudication was an
unlooked-for circumstance which does not change the
result in the light of the construction which we give the
statute.
It follows that the judgment should be
Affirmed.
