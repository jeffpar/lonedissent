said, as matter of law, that defendant had undertaken
any duty requiring him to make special study or inquiry
respecting plaintiff's condition or the possibility of injury
to her, or to advise her of such possibility of injury; for
there was testimony, already referred to, that would have
warranted a finding that Dr. Kerr had assumed the responsibility of advising the plaintiff respecting the propriety of her submitting to the operation.

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.'
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 97.

Argued December 18, 1912.-Decided April 7, 1913.

From an early period Congress has accorded to the Executive a large
discretion about setting apart and reserving portions of the public
domain in aid of particular public purposes.
Section 2 of the act of April 8, 1864, conferring power on-the Executive
to set apart reservations for Indians, was a continuing power and
was not exhausted by the first order establishing reservations thereunder.
The extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation- made by Executive
Order of October 16, 1891, including a tract of country in California
one mile in width on each side of the Klamath River, was lawfully
established pursuant to the act of 1864.
In view of the history of the case, the custom of the Klamath Indians
for whose benefit the Hoopa Valley Reservation was established, the
Government ownership of the territory and its acquisition from
Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, as well as the
statutes, and decisions of the courts, of California to the effect that
the Klamath River is a non-navigable stream, held that such reservation included the bed of the Klamath River.
What are navigable streams within the meaning of the local rules of

Statement of the Case.

property is for the determination of the States; and where a State
by statute enumerates the navigable streams within its borders
those not enumerated are non-navigable in law.
The prime requisites for the validity of a mining claim are discovery of
a valuable mineral deposit, an actual taking possession thereof, and
the performance of the requisite amount of development work;
where the record does not disclose facts showing the existence of
these elements a finding cannot be supported that valid rights against
the Government existed.
The creation and maintenance of a school district by the State of
California within the public domain and not in section 16 or 36 could
not impair the right of the Federal Goveinment tb dispose of that
domain.
The words "sole and exclusive jurisdiction" as used in § 2145, Rev.
Stat., do not mean that the United States must have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the Indian country in order that such section
may'apply to it; those words are used in order to describe the laws
of the United States which by that section are extended to the Indian country. In re Wilson, 140 U. S. 573.
The term "Indian country" as used in §§ 2145, 2146, Rev. Stat., is not
confined to lands to which the Indians retain their original right of
possession, but includes those set apart out of the public domain as
reservations for, and not previously occupied by, the Indians.
The killing of an Indian by one not of Indian blood, when committed
upon an Indian reservation within the State of California, is punishable, under §§ 2145 and 5339, Rev. Stat., in the Federal courts.
Hearsay evidence with a few well-recognized exceptions, is excluded
by courts that adhere to the principles of the common law.
After reviewing numerous authorities, held that, in this case, the court
properly excluded hearsay evidence relating to the confession of a
third party, then deceased, of guilt of the crime with which defendant
was charged.
In this country there is a great and practically unanimous weight of
authority in the state courts against admitting evidence of confessions of third parties made out of court and tending to exonerate
the accused.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a conviction
and sentence of a white man for murder of an Indian on

the Klamath River within the Hoopa Valley Reservation,
are stated in the opinion.

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mr. John F. Quinn, with whom Mr. W. F. Clyborne was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
To give the United States court jurisdiction the indictment must allege that plaintiff in error was an Indian.
Draperv. United States, 164 U. S. 241.
Federal courts have jurisdiction of offenses committed
within the limits of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation
only under § 9 of the act of 1885, which act distinctly
provides that Indians shall be amenable to the courts of
the United States for the commission of the crime of
murder against the person of an Indian or other person.
But only Indians can be proceeded against under this act.
See § 5339, Rev. Stat.
The crime charged was not committed within the limits
of any of the places enumerated in that section and consequently the United States courts would not have jurisdiction as the Hoopa Valley Reservation is not a place
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.
The State, not the United States, has jurisdiction of the
crime of murder committed within the limits of an Indian
reservation within the boundaries of a State by a white
person against a white person. United States v. McBratney, 104 U. S. 621; United States v. Draper, 164 U. S. 240;
United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 385.
It is not charged in the indictment that the reservation
or the place of the alleged crime is Indian country. This
reservation is not and never has been Indian country
since California became part of the United States.
In order to be Indian country the Indians must retain
their original title to the soil, and this extension does not
include any land to which the original Indian title has
never been extinguished. Bates v. Clark, 95 U. S. 204,
209; United States v. Celestine, 215 U. S. 285.
There is no treaty with any tribe of Indians as to the
jurisdiction over the land involved in this case. Neither
is-there any treaty or act of Congress defining it to be

228 U. S.

or giving it the character of Indian country. Under the
act of 1864 and the executive orders the United States
simply set apart for the purposes of an Indian reservation
land to which it already had title. If an Indian reservation within a State is. Indian country, the Federal courts
would have had jurisdiction in the Draper and McBratney
Cases, under the act of June 30, 1834, and as amended in
1864 (§ 2145, Rev. Stat.), and under Westmoreland v.
United States, 155 U. S. 547, which held that the court had
jurisdiction of a white person. The only way in which the
Draper and McBratney Cases can be reconciled with the
Westmoreland Case is that an Indian reservation within
the boundaries of a State is not Indian country.
It is essential to allege in the indictment and prove on
the trial that the accused is an Indian. United States v.
Hadley, 99 Fed. Rep. 437; United States v. Logan, 105
Fed. Rep. 240; State v. Campbell, 53 Minnesota, 354.
The United States never reserved any jurisdiction over
the land included within the Hoopa Reservation either
in the act admitting California into the Union or in any
other act. Neither did the State of California at any time
cede to the United States any jurisdiction over such land
or disclaim in any manner jurisdiction over the same.
No treaty or other compact was ever entered into between the United States or any band or tribe of Indians
in reference to such land. The State of California had
absolute criminal jurisdiction over this land for 41 years,
and even if an Indian had killed another Indian on the
land mentioned in the indictment on October 15, 1891, or
any time prior thereto, the state and not the Federal
courts would have had jurisdiction.
The executive order of President Harrison issued
October 16, 1891, creating the extension to the Hoopa
Valley Reservation, is absolutely void, not being authorized by any act of Congress. There is now no legal
extension to the Hoopa Valley Reservation and there

can be none until there is an act of Congress authorizing it.
But even if the extension of the reservation was lawfully
created, the alleged crime was committed on the Klamath
River which is outside the limits of the extension. The
description excludes the river, and even if the order had
attempted to include it, it would have been void to that
extent, as California was admitted into the Union upon
the condition that the navigable rivers should be public
highways as to the citizens of all States. 9 Stat. 453; Lux
v. Haggin, 69 California, 335.
The Klamath River is a navigable stream and the
alleged crime occurred at a point on the river where it was
actually used for the purposes of commerce.
The court will take judicial notice that the tide ebbs
and flows on the Klamath near its mouth. See United
States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297; The Apollon, 9
Wheat. 374; Peyroux v. Howard, 7 Pet. 341; 1 Greene
Ev., § 6.
As the Klamath River flows into the Pacific Ocean, the
court will take judicial notice that it is a tidal river at
least near its mouth.
President Harrison recognizing then the sovereignty of
the States over navigable waters purposely excluded the
Klamath River from the limits of the reservation he attempted to create by his executive order of October 16,
1891.
The alleged crime was committed on the Klamath
River. The Government's testimony proves this.
It was the theory of the Government at the trial as
before stated that Chickasaw was shot while in bathing
and that his slayer occupied the clump of willows on the
sand or gravel bar when he fired the fatal shot.
The alleged crime took place below ordinary high water.
A river is composed of its banks, bed, and water. It

stitute a river. Ravenwood v. Fleming, 22 W. Va. 52;
Ellis v. Gerbing, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 337.
Prior to the attempted establishment of the reservation
a mining claim had been located and a school district
established at the place where the crime was alleged to
have been committed, so that, under the executive order,
that particular place was excepted from the reservation.
There was error in excluding evidence as to the confession of Joe Dick. See where Wigmore on Evidence in
§§ 1476 et seq. attacks the principle that would accept
declarations against a pecuniary or a proprietary interest,
but not a penal interest and shows the injustice of prohibiting the, confession of a person, deceased or otherwise,
unavailable as witness, of a crime for which another person
is being tried.
.There was error in denying motion for a new trial and in
arrest of judgment.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison for the United
States:

228 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

Revised Statutes, § 2145, applies to crimes either by or
against Indians within the Indian country. UnitedStates v.
McBratney, 104 U. S. 621 and Draperv. United States, 164
U. S. 240, decided merely that crimes by whites against
whites were subjects of state jurisdiction, but left open
the question here involved as to crimes by or against
Indians.
These latter crimes, being a part of the intercourse
between the two races, are fundamentally within the
scope of regulation by Congress rather than by the States.
Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 557, and see act of
July 22, 1790, c. 33; 1 Stat. 137; of March 1, 1793, 1 Stat.

1854, 10 Stat. 269, 270; §§ 2145, 2146, Rev. Stat.
The protection of the Indians from crimes by whites
intruding on their reservations is a part of the Federal
function founded both on the prevention of Indian outbreaks, Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. p. 552, and the duty
of the United States to protect the Indians as its wards.
See Kagama v. United States, 118 U. S. 375; United States
v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432, 437; Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S.

161 Fed. Rep. 835; Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S.
413; United States v. Sutton, supra. This is implied in the
very fact of the creation of the reservation for the exclusive and undisturbed use of the Indians. Worcester v.
Georgia, supra; Rainbow v. Young, 161 Fed. Rep. 835.
See also Rev. Stat., § 2114, and the other sections under
the titles "Government and protection of Indians," and

The act of March 3, 1885, does not repeal Rev. Stat.,

An "Indian Reservation" is "Indian Country," even
though the reservation has been carved out of the public
domain. In re Wilson, 140 U. S. 575; United States v.

The extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation was
lawful.- It was an extension, not only of the Hoopa
Valley Reservation, but of the Klamath River Reservation, and so came within the express language of the act
of April 8, 1864. See 33 L. D., p. 205.
In any event, the executive had the power to set apart
the reservation. In re Wilson, 140 U. S. 575; Spalding

228 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

Congress was advised of its creation and has continued
its appropriation undisturbed.
The point that the place of the crime was covered by a
valid mining claim, and was, therefore, not within the
reservation, is not properly raised by the bill of exceptions.

Rep. 694; Richardson v. United States, 181 Fed. Rep. 1.
The fact that there is nothing in the record to show
otherwise does not prove the mining claim had been
made good or "was valid." Black v. Elkhorn Mining Co.,

The place of the crime was not excluded from the extension because of the existence of a state school district;
that point is not sound on the merits, nor was it properly
raised. United States v. Thomas, 151 U. S. 577, p. 583, and

collecting the authorities, but the evidence was properly
excluded.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
Plaintiff in error was convicted in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Northern District of California,
upon an indictment for murder, and, having been sentenced to life imprisonment, ues out this writ of error.
The indictment charged him with the murder of one Chickasaw, an Indian, within the limits of an Indian reservation
known ag the Extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation,
in the County of Humboldt, in the State and Northern
District of California. The evidence tended to show that
Chickasaw, who was an Indian and a member of the
Klamath Tribe, was shot through thd body and mortally
wounded while he was in or near the edge of the water of
the Klamath River, at a place within the exterior limits
of the Extension.
The trial proceeded upon the theory that the crime was
committed within the river bed and below ordinary high.water mark-a theory favorable to the plaintiff in error,
in that it furnishes the basis for one of the principal contentions made in his behalf. The indictment does not
allege, nor did the Government undertake to prove, that
plaintiff in error was of Indian blood; there was evidence
tending to show that he was a white man; and the trial
judge instructed the jury in effect that this question was
immaterial. It was contended that the Circuit Court was
without jurisdiction, first, because the place of the commission of the alleged offense was not within the limits of
the Extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, but was
upon the Klamath River, and therefore outside of those
limits; and, secondly, because it did not appear that the
defendant was an Indian. These contentions, having
been overruled below, are renewed here, and some other

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

jurisdictional questions are raised. In addition, it is contended that the Circuit Court erred in refusing to permit
the plaintiff in error to introduce evidence tending to show
that one Joe Dick, a deceased Indian, had confessed just
before his death that it was he who had shot and killed
the Indian Chickasaw.
The bounds of the Hoopa Valley Reservation were first
established by executive order of President Grant, dated
June 23, 1876, made under authority of "An act to provide
for the better organization of Indian affairs in California;"
approved April 8, 1864; 13 Stat. 39, c. 48. The reservation, as thus delimited, comprised a tract of country in
Humboldt County, about 89,000 acres in extent, lying
on both sides of the Trinity River, above its junction with
the Klamath. Exec. Ord. Ind. Reserv. (ed. 1912), p. 38;
1 Kappler, 815.
What is known as the Extension of the Hoopa Valley
Reservation was made by executive order of President'
Harrison, dated October 16, 1891, and included "a tract
of country one mile in width on each side of the Klamath
River, and extending from the present limits of the said
Hoopa Valley Reservation to the Pacific Ocean," with a
proviso to be mentioned hereafter. Exec. Ord. Ind. Reserv.
(ed. 1912), p. 39; 1 Kappler, 815. The extension as thus
described took in the original Klamath River Reservation
(established by President Pierce in 1855; Ex. Ord. Ind.
Reserv. 1912, p. 41), that extended along the river for a
distance of twenty miles from the -ocean. This portion
was, by act of June 17, 1892, 27 Stat. 52, c. 120, opened
to settlement, entry and purchase. The locus in quo is
not within the part thus opened, but is at a point higher
up the river.
The indictment and conviction are based upon § 2145,
Rev. Stat., providing that certain general laws of the
United States as to the punishment of crimes committed
in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

the United States, except the District of Columbia, "shall

Stat., which enacts that any person who commits murder
in any place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States shall suffer death. These sections, together with
§ 2146, Rev. Stat., and § 9 of an act of March 3, 1885, 23
Stat. 362, 385, c. 341, being all pertinent to the discussion

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The record presents the following questions, and it
will be assumed that, in view of the course taken at the
trial, they must all be answered favorably to the Government in order that the conviction may be sustained.
(1) Was the Extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation lawfully established?
(2) Does it include the bed of the Klamath River?
(3) Is the place of the homicide, for particular reasons
to be mentioned, not a part of the reservation?
(4) Is the Extension (if lawfully established) "Indian
country" within the meaning of § 2145, Rev. Stat.?
(5) Is the killing of an Indian by one who is not of
Indian blood, when committed upon an Indian reservation
within the State of California, punishable in the Federal
courts?
(6) Was the evidence offered to show an alleged confession by Joe Dick properly excluded?
1. It is contended in behalf of the plaintiff in error that
the authority conferred upon the Executive by Congress
in the act of April 8, 1864 (13 Stat. 39, c. 48), was exhausted in the creation by President Grant of the Hoopa
Valley Reservation in 1876. Section 2 of that act provides
as follows: "Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That there
shall be set apart by the President, and at his discretion,
not exceeding four tracts of land, within the limits of said
State, to be retained by the United States for the purposes of Indian Reservations, which shall be of suitable
extent for the accommodation of the Indians of said State,
and shall be located as remote from white settlements as
may be found practicable, having due regard to their
adaptation to the purposes for which they are intended;
Provided, That at least one of said tracts shall be located
Bame laws, tried in the same courts and in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties as are all other persons committing any of
the above crimes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.

in what has heretofore been known as the northern
district; . . . and Provided,further, That said tracts
to be set apart as aforesaid may, or may not, as in the
discretion of the President may be deemed for the best
interests' of the Indians to be provided for, include any of
the Indian Reservations heretofore set apart in said state,
and that in case any such reservation is so included, the
same may be enlarged to such an extent as in the opinion
of the President may be necessary, in order to its complete
adaptation to the purposes for which, t is intended."
The terms of this enactment show that Congress intended to confer a discretionary power, and from an early
period Congress has customarily accorded to the Executive a large discretion about setting apart and reserving

We have made a somewhat exhaustive examination of
the history of the Indian reservations of California and
what has been done by the executive and legislative
departments of the Federal Government respecting them,
and as a result we are convinced, first, that the situation of
Indian affairs in that State in the year 1864 was such
that Congress could not reasonably have supposed that
the President would~be able to accomplish the beneficent
purposes of the enactment if he were obliged to act, once
for all, with respect to the establishment of the several
new reservations that were provided for, and were left

Opinion of the Court.

powerless to alter and enlarge the reservations from time
to time in the light of experience. To mention but one
obstacle that must have been within the contemplation of
Congress: the Klamath and Hoopa-or Trinity Indians
were at war with the forces of the United States at the
time of the passage of the act of 1864, and had been so for
some years. Indian Report, 1864, pp. 123, 127, 130, 133,
134-138. Secondly, beginning shortly after its passage,
and continuing for a period of at least thirty years thereafter, Congress and the Executive practically construed
the act of 1864 as conferring a continuing authority
upon the latter, and a large discretion about exercising it.
Congress itself recognized the Hoopa Valley Reservation as lawfully existing, at least as early as July 27, 1868
(15 Stat. 198, 221, c. 248), when it appropriated money
"to pay the settlers of Hoopa Valley for their personal
property left upon the Hoopa Valley Reservation at the
time the Government took possession;" and also "for
removing the Indians from Smith's River Reservation to
Hoopa Valley and Round Valley Reservations .
and the Smith River Reservation is hereby discontinued;"
and again, in the following year, (act of April 10, 1869,
16 Stat. 13, 37, c. 16), when it appropriated money for
the pay of a miller upon the Hoopa Valley Reservation,
and "to supply a deficiency for removing the Indians from
Smith's River Reservation to Hoopa Valley and Round
Valley Reservations." Yet no formal executive order had
as yet been made setting aside the Hoopa Valley Reservation or fixing its bounds; and its status as a reservation
rested upon a mere public notice given by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California, under date August 21,
1864, to the effect that under the act of April 8, 1864,
and under instructions from the Interior Department, he
had located a reservation in the Hoop'a Valley, and that
settlers should not make further improvements upon their

places (Rep. Ind'n Com'r, 1864, pp. 123, 138; Exec. Ord.
Ind. Reserv., 1912, p. 38; 1 Kappler, 815).
In the year following President Harrison's order the
Extension.was reported upon by the Indian agent to the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs as being occupied by the
Lower Klamath Tribe. House Executive Documents,
2d Sess., 52d Cong., 1892-1893, Vol. 13 (Indian Report),
p. 230. And a similar report was made in the year 1894.
House Executive Documents, 3d Sess., 53d Cong., 18941895, Vol. 15 (Indian Report), p. 117. These reports
were officially communicated by the Secretary of the
Interior to Congress, and there is nothing to show any
disapproval of the status of the Extension as an Indian
reservation.
But, further, the Hoopa Valley Reservation was only
one of four that were authorized by the act of 1864.
Other reservations established thereunder were known
as the Tule River, Round Valley, and Mission Reservations. Upon the question of practical construction, the
action taken by the Executive and by Congress respecting
these is as significant as that taken with respect to the
Hoopa Valley Reservation itself. A sufficient summary
of their history is given in Crichton v. Shelton, 33 L. D.
205, 209, 213. The executive orders respecting them are
to be found in Exec. Ord. Ind. Reserv. 1912, pp. 43, 55,
61, etc. It will be seen that Presidents Grant, Hayes,
Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland., and Harrison, successively,
acted with respect to one or more of these reservations
upon the theory that the act of 1864 conferred a continuing discretion upon the Executive; orders were made for
altering and enlarging the bounds of the reservations,
restoring portions of their territory to the public domain,
and abolishing reservations once made and establishing
others in their stead; and in numerous instances Congress
in effect ratified such action. In view of all this, we feel
bound to hold that President Harrison's order of Octo-

ber 16, 1891, extending the Hoopa Valley Reservation,
was within the authority of the act of .1864.
2. Does the reservation include the bed of the Klamath
River? The descriptive words of the order are "a tract
of country one mile in. width on each side of the Klamath
River and extending," etc. It seems to us clear that if
the United States was the owner of the river bed, a reasonable construction of this language requires that the
river be considered as included within the reservation.
Indeed, in view of all the circumstances, it would be absurd to treat the order as intended to include the uplands
to the width of one mile on each side of the river, and
at the same time to exclude the river. As a matter of
history it plainly appears that the Klamath Indians established themselves along the river in order to gain a
subsistence by fishing. The repprts of the local Indian
agents and superintendents to the Commissioners of
Indian Affairs abound in references to fishing as their
principal subsistence, and the river is described as running
in a narrow canyon through a broken country, the Indians As dwelling in small villages close to its banks. (Indian Reports, 1856, p. 238; 1857, p. 391; 1858, pp. 286287; 1859, p. 437; 1861, p. 147; 1864, p. 122; 1866, p. 238;
1885, p. 264; 1888, p. 10; 1892, p. 230; 1894, p. 117; and
see 33 L. D. 216.)
Upon the question of Government ownership, it is
a matter of history that the entire territory in question
was a part of the public domain that was transferred by
Mexico to the United States in the year 1848 by the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. February 2, 1848, 9 Stat.
922; United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S.375, 381.
By act of September 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 452, c. 50, California was admitted into the Union "on an equal footing
with the original States in all respects whatever." By
§ 3 of the same act it was provided: "That the said State
of California is admitted into the Union upon the express

condition that the people of said State, through their
legislature or otherwise; shall never interfere with the
primary disposal of the public lands within its limits,
and shall pass no law and do no act whereby the title of
the United States to, 'and right to dispose of, the same
shall be impaired or questioned;
.
and that all
the navigable waters within the said State shall be common
highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants
of said State as to the citizens of the.United States, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor."
it is insisted that the Klamath is a navigable river;
and there is evidence in the record tending to show that
the stream is navigable in fact, at certain seasons, 'from
Requa (near its mouth) up to and above the locus in quo.'
But, in the view we take of the present case, the question
of its navigability, in fact or in law, is, immaterial ecept as it bears upon the title of the United States to the
bed of the stream. The present question is whether that
bed was a part of an Indian reservation, and that depends
upon the question of ownership. The jurisdiction to
punish the 'laintiff in error for the murder of an Indian
upon the reservation depends upon other considerations,
as will appear hereafter.
In passing upon the effect of the act admitting Alabama
into the Union, this -court held, in Pollard's Lessee v.
Hagan, 3 How. 212, that the State had the 'same rights,
sovereignty, and jurisdiction over the navigable waters
as the original States, and could exercise all the powers
of government which belong to and may be exercised
by them, excepting with respect to control over public
lands owned by the United States; and that the title of
the navigable waters, and the soil beneath them, was in
the State and subject to its sovereignty and jurisdiction.
In Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, it was settled
that for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction the tidal test,
prevailing in England for determining what is navigable

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

water, is not applicable to this country. In Barney v.
Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338, it was held that it is for the
States to establish for themselves such rules of property
as they may deem expedient with respect to the navigable
waters within their borders and the riparian lands adjacent
thereto. The court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, said (94 U. S.338): "The confusion of navigable with
tide water, found in the monuments of the common-law,
long prevailed in this country, notwithstanding the
broad differences existing between the extent and topography of the British island and that of the American
continent. It had the influence for two generations of
excluding the admiralty jurisdiction from our great
rivers and inland seas; and under the like influence it
laid the foundation in many States of doctrines with regard to the ownership of the soil in navigable waters
above tide-water at variance with sound principles of
public policy. Whether, as rules of property, it would now
be safe to change these doctrines where they have been applied,
as before remarked, is for the several States themselves to
determine. If they choose to resign to the riparianproprietor
rights which properly belong to them in their sovereign capacity, it is not for others to raise objections. In our view of the
subject the correct principles were laid down in Martin v.
Waddell, 16 Pet. 367; Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How.
212; and Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 Id. 471. These cases related
to tide-water, it is true; but they enunciate principles
which are equally applicable to all navigable waters.
And since this court, in the case of The Genesee Chief,
12 Id. 443, has declaredthat the Great Lakes and other
navigable waters of the country, above as well as below
the flow of the tide, are, in the strictest sense, entitled
to the denomination of navigable waters, and amenable
to the admiralty jurisdiction, there seems to be no sound
reason for adhering to the old rule as to the proprietorship
.of the beds and shores of such waters. It properly belongs

to the States by their inherent sovereignty, and the United
States has wisely abstained from extending (if it could
extend) its survey and grants beyond the limits of high
water. The cases in which this court has seemed to hold
a contrary view depended, as most cases must depend,
on the local laws of the States in which the lands were
situated'."
The doctrine thus enunciated has since been adhered to.
Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 669; Hardin v. Jordan,
140 U. S. 371, 382; Shively v. Bowlby,.152 U. S. 1, 40, 58;
St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. Water Commissioners,
168 U. S. 349, 358; Scott v. Lattig, 227 If. S. 229, 243.
The question of the navigability in fact of non-tidal
streams is sometimes a doubtful one. It has been held
in effect that what are navigable waters of the United
States, within the meaning of the act of Congress, in
contradistinction to the navigable waters of the States,
depends upon whether the stream in its ordinary condition affords a channel for useful commerce. The Montello,
20 Wall. 430; Leovy v. United States, 177 U. S.621, 632;
United States v. Rio Grande, 174 U. S.690, 698; South Carolina v. Georgia,93 U. S.4, 10; The Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 28.
But it results from the principles already referred to
that :what shall be deemed a navigable water within the
meaning of the local rules of property is for the determination of the several States. Thus the State of California,
if she sees fit, may confer upon the riparian owners the
title to the bed of any navigable stream within her borders.
Now, a California statute of April 23, 1880, c. 122,
Laws 1880, p. 136,1 declared the Klaimath River to be
navigable from its mouth to the town of Orleans Bar,
which is above the locus in quo. But this was repealed
by act of February 24, 1891, c. 14, Laws 1891, p. 10; and
by an act of March 11, 1891, c. 92, Laws 1891, p. 96
(Political Code, § 2349), an enumeration was made of all

Opinion of the Court.

the navigable rivers of the State. This is held by the
Supreme Court of that State to be exclusive, so that no
other rivers are navigable under the laws of California.
Cardwell v. County of Sacramento, 79 California, 347, 349.
The Klamath River is not among those thus enumerated,
and it must therefore be treated as not navigable in law.
And it will be observed that it was thus placed in the
category of non-navigable streams prior to President
Harrison's order of October 16, 1891, by which the Extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation was established.
In the important case of Lux v. Haggin (1886), 69
California, 255, 335, 337, the Supreme Court of California,
after pointing out that upon the admission of that State
into the Union "upon an equal footing" with the original
thirteen States, she became seised of all the rights of
sovereignty, jurisdiction, and eminent domain which those
States possessed, and that under § 3 of the act of Admission (9 Stat. 452, c, 50) the lands of the United States not
reserved or purchased for fortifications, etc., are held as
are held the lands of private persons, with the exception
that the State cannot interfere with the primary disposal
of them nor tax them, and that the navigable waters are
common highways, free to the inhabitants of the State and
to citizens of the United States-proceeded to declare
that whether this act did or did not operate as an immediate transfer of the property in non-navigable rivers
to the Federal Government, the legislature of the State,
on April 13, 1850, passed an act adopting the common law
of England, so far as not repugnant to or inconsistent with
the Constitution of the United States or the constitution
or laws of the State of California, as the rule of decision
in all courts of the State, and that in view of the subsequent judicial history of the State this act must be held
to have operated, at least from the admission of the State
into the Union, as a transfer to all riparian proprietors,
including the United States, of the property of the State,

228 U. S.

if any she had, in the non-navigable streams and the soil
beneath them. The authority of this decision was recognized in Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S.661, 669. We are not
able to find that the doctrine declared in it has since been
departed from by the courts of the State.
It thus appears, from the course of legislation and adjudication by the appropriate authorities of California, not
only that the Klamath River has been placed in the category of non-navigable streams, but that the title of the
United States to the bed of it where it runs through the public lands has been distinctly recognized. In short, by the
acts of legislation mentioned, as construed by the highest
court of the State-(a) the act of 1850, adopting the common law and thereby transferring to all riparian proprietors (or confirming in them) the ownership of the nonnavigable streams and their beds, and (b) the acts of
February 24 and of March 11, 1891, declaring in effect
that the Klamath River is a non-navigable streamCalifornia has vested in the United States, as riparian
owner, the title to the bed of the Klamath, if in fact it be a
navigable river. If in fact it be non-navigable, it isobvious that the same result flows from the mere adoption
of the common law.
From this it results that whether the river be or be not
navigable in fact, the river bed is to be deemed as included
within the Extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation.
3. But the order establishing the Extension as a reservation (Exec. Ord. Ind. Reserv. 1912, p. 39, 1 Kappler, 815),
contained the proviso-" That any tract or tracts included
within the above described boundaries, to which valid
rights have attached under the laws of the United States,
are hereby excluded from the reservation as hereby extended."
Upon the trial a certified copy of a notice of the location
of a "mining claim" filed October 20, 1888, in the Recorder's office of Humboldt County, was introduced in

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

evidence, wherein notice was given by eight persons named
therein-" that the undersigned, having complied with
the requirements of Chapter A of Title 32, of the Revised
Statutes of the United States, and the local customs, laws,
and regulations, have located twenty acres each of placer
mining ground, situated in the County of Humboldt and
State of California, and described as follows." Then
followed a description showing exterior limits conforming
to legal subdivisions of the public lands; and from other
evidence it appeared that the land thus claimed bordered
upon, but did not include, the river at the locus in quo.
There is no other evidence respecting this mining claim
or location excepting the testimony of a witness to the
effect that there was "a mine" in the vicinity of the
Indian village where the crime occurred; the character or
location of the mine not being otherwise described.
It is-doubtful whether there is any evidence that would
have supported a finding that the crime was committed
elsewhere than within the river bed. Waiving this point,
however, we will consider the effect of the mining location,
upon the theory that the crime may have occurred within
the limits of the claim.
By § 2329, Rev. Stat., placer claims are "subject to
entry and patent, under like circumstances and conditions,
and upon similar proceedings, as are provided for vein
or lode claims." By § 2330, "two or more persons, or
associations of persons, having contiguous claims .
may make joint entry thereof; but no location of a placerclaim, made after the ninth day of July, eighteen hundred
and seventy, shall exceed one hundred and sixty acres for
any one person or association of persons, which location
shall conform to the United States surveys." By § 2331,
placer-claims upon surveyed lands, and conforming to
legal subdivisions, require no further survey or plat, and
no such location shall include more than twenty acre.3
for each individual claimant. By § 2332, where such per-

sons or associations have held and worked their claim for a
period equal to the time prescribed by the statute of limitations for mining-claims by the local law, evidence of such
possession and working shall establish a right to patent,
in the absence of adverse claim. The circumstances, conditions, and proceedings referred to in § 2329 are those
set forth in the preceding sections beginning with § 2318.
The chief requirements are,-the discovery of a valuable
mineral deposit within the limits of the claim (§§ 23182320); the claimants must be citizens of the United States,
or must have declared their intention to become such
(§§ 2319, 2321); "the location must be distinctly marked
on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced"
(§ 2324); and a certain amount of work must be done in
accordance with local regulations, and "on each claim
located after the tenth day of May, 1872, and until a
patent has been issued therefor, not less than one hundred
dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year" (§ 2324).
The prime requisites are, the discovery of a valuable
mineral deposit, an actual taking possession thereof, and
the performance of the requisite amount of development
work. Erhardt v. Boaro, 113 U. S. 527, 535; Black v.
Elkhorn Mining Co., 163 U. S. 445, 450; Chrisman v.
Miller, 197 U. S. 313, 321.
The history of the legislation of Congress upon the subject, and the effect thereof, are referred to in numerous
decisions of this court, among them Belk v. Meagher, 104

Opinion of the Court.

Of course, under this legislative scheme,' a mining claim
may be abandoned by failure to do the required development work. Chambers v. Harrington, 111 U. S. 350, 353;
Black v. Elkhorn Mining Co., 163 U. S.445, 450; Erhardt
v. Boaro, 113 U. S. 527, 535.
The evidence in the record is altogether too meagre and
indefinite to furnish support for a finding that at the time
of the Executive Order of October 16, 1891, or at any
time, valid rights had attached to the placer-claim above
referred to.
Next, it appears from the evidence that prior to October, 1891, the Board of Supervisors of Humboldt County
created a school district which included within its bounds
the place where the homicide occurred, and that after
October, 1891, the county created, out of the district
mentioned, a second school district, Which included the
place in question. It was in evidence that this school district was maintained by the county, and not by the Government, down to the time of the trial herein. From this
it is argued that the State and county had assumed jurisdiction over the land on each side of the Klamath River
for school purposes before the enlargement of the Hoopa
Valley Reservation, and that the State still exercises the
right to maintain a school there.
But we are clear that the creation and maintenance of
such a school district by the State could not in anywise
impair the title of the United States to the lands included
in such district, or limit the authority of the United
States over such lands when set apart for an Indian reservation. The Act of Admission, September 9, 1850; 9
Stat. 452, c. 50, § 3 provided- "That the said State of
California is admitted into the Union upon the express
condition that the people of said State, through their
legislature or otherwise, shall never interfere with the
primary disposal of the public lands within its limits,
and shall pass no law and do no act whereby the title of

228 U. S.

the United States to, and right to dispose of, the same shall
be impaired or questioned;" etc. By act of March 3,
1853, 10 Stat. 244, 246, c. 145, § 6, Congress granted to
the State for the purposes of public schools sections 16
and 36 in each township. And by act of July 23, 1866, 14
Stat. 218, 220, c. 219, § 6, Congress gave to the State
"the right to select for school purposes other lands in lieu
of such sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections as were settled
upon prior to survey, reserved for public uses, covered by
grants made under Spanish or Mexican authority, or by
other private claims," etc. It affirmatively appears, however, that the locus in quo was not within either the sixteenth or the thirty-sixth section, and it does not appear
that it was selected by the State as "lieu" lands. Therefore the existence of the state school district is without
present significance. For, as was pointed out in the Wilson
Case, 140 U. S. p. 578, the words "sole and exclusive jurisdiction," as employed in § 2145, Rev. Stat., do not mean
that the United States must have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the Indian country in order that that section
may apply to it; the words are used in order to describe
the laws of the United States which by that section are
extended to the Indian country.
4. It is contended for plaintiff in error that the term
"Indian country" is confined to lands to which the Indians retain their original right of possession, and is not
applicable to those set apart as an Indian reservation out
of the public domain, and not previously occupied by the
Indians.
Sections 2145 and 2146 are found in Title XXVIII of the
Revised Statutes, which title relates to Indians, and
within chap. 4, the sub-title of which is "Government of
Indian Country." Section 'after-section. in that chapter
contains provisions of law applicable only to Indian
country, and yet the act contains no definition of that
term. In the Indian Intercourse'Act of June 30, 1834, 4

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Stat. 729, c. 161, the first section defined the "Indian
country" for the purposes of that act. But this section w s
not reenacted in the Revised Statutes, and it was therefore repealed by § 5596, Rev. Stat. Ex parte Crow Dog,
109 U. S.556, 561; United States v. LeBris, 121 U. S. 278,
280; Clairmont v. United States, 225 U. S.551, 557. Under
these decisions the definition as contained in the act of
1834 may still "be referred to in connection with the
provisions of its original context that remain in force, and
may be considered in connection with the changes which
have taken place in our situation, with a view of determining from time to time what must be regarded as
Indian country where it is spoken of in the statutes."
With reference to country that was formerly subject to
the Indian occupancy, the cases cited furnish a criterion
for determining what is "Indian country." But "the
changes which have taken place in our situation" are so
.numerous and so material, that the term cannot now be
confined to land formerly held by the Indians, and to
which their title remains unextinguished. And, in our
judgment, nothing can more appropriately be deemed
"Indian country," within the meaning of those provisions
of the Revised Statutes that relate to the regulation of
the Indians and the government of the Indian country,
than a tract of land that, being a part of the public domain, is lawfully set apart as an Indian reservation.
5. Is the killing of an Indian by a person not of Indian
blood, when committed upon an Indian reservation within
the limits of a State, cognizable in the Federal courts?
It is insisted by plaintiff in error that § 9 of -the act of
March 3, 1885 (set forth in full in the marginal note,
above), which declares that "all such Indians committing
any of the above crimes (including murder) against the
person or property of another Indian or other person
within the boundaries of any State of the United States,
and within the limits of any Indian reservation, shall be

228 U. S.

subject to the same laws, tried in the same courts and in
the same manner, and subject to the same penalties as
are all other persons committing any of the above crimes
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States"constitutes the only legislation of Congress providing for
punishing the crime of murder when committed upon an
Indian within the limits of an Indian reservation. The
argument is that this act operated to repeal § 2145, Rev.
Stat., which extended to the Indian country certain
general laws of the United States as to the punishment of
crimes. This argument is plainly untenable. The act of
1885, of itself, provides for the.punishment of crimes committed by Indians only. So far from impliedly repealing
§ 2145, Rev. Stat., it manifestly repeals in part the limitation that was imposed by § 2146 upon the effect of § 2145.
It was pointed out by this court in Ex parte Crow Dog
(1883), 109 U. S.556, 571, that "The provisions now contained in §§ 2145 and 2146 of the Revised Statutes were
first enacted in § 25 of the Indian Intercourse Act of
June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729, 733, c. 161. Prior to that, by
the act of May 19, 1796, 1 Stat. 469, c. 30, and the act of
March 30, 1802, 2 Stat. 139, c. 13, offenses committed
by Indians against white persons, and by white persons
against Indians, were specifically enumerated and defined,
and those by Indians against each other were left to be
dealt with by each tribe for itself, according to its local
customs. The policy of the government in that respect
has been uniform." The point decided was that certain
general expressions in the treaty with the Sioux Jndians
made in 1868 had not the effect of impliedly repealing the
express limitation contained in § 2146. As a result, Crow
Dog went unpunished by the Federal authority for the
murder of Spotted Tail, another Indian. And this no
doubt was one of the causes that led to the enactment of
§ 9 of the act of March 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 385, as was
pointed out in United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375,

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

383, where § 9 was sustained as valid and constitutional
in both its branches, namely, that which provides for the
punishment of the crimes enumerated when committed
by Indians within the Territories, and that which provides for the punishment of the same crimes when committed by an Indian on an Indian reservation within a
State of the Union; and see In re Wilson, 140 U. S. 575,
578.
Section 2145, Rev. Stat., in connection with § 5339,
plainly includes within its terms the offense of murder
committed against the person of an Indian within an
Indian reservation by a person not of Indian blood, but
it is contended that the admission of California into the
Union "on an equal footing with the original States,"
without any express reservation by Congress of governmental jurisdiction over the public lands contained within
her borders, conferred upon the State undivided authority
to punish crimes committed upon those lands, even when
set apart for an Indian reservation, excepting crimes committed by the Indians. Reference is made to the cases of
United States v. McBratney, 104 U. S. 621, and Draperv.
United States, 164 U. S. 240, where it was held, in effect,
that the organization and admission of States qualified
the former Federal jurisdiction over Indian country included therein by withdrawing from the United States
and conferring upon the States the control of offenses
committed by white people against whites, in the absence
of some law or treaty to the contrary. In both cases,
however, the question was reserved as to the effect of the
admission of the State into the Union upon the Federal
jurisdiction over crimes committed by or against the Indians themselves. (104 U. S. 624; 164 U. S. 247.) Upon
full consideration we are satisfied that offenses committed
by or against Indians are not within the principle of the
McBratney and Draper Cases. This was in effect held, as
to crimes committed by the Indians, in the Kagama Case,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

228 U. S.

118 U. S. 375, 383, where the constitutionality of the
second branch of § 9 of the act of March 3, 1885, 23 Stat.
385, was sustained upon the ground that the Indian tribes
are the wards of the nation. This same reason appliesperhaps a fortiori-with respect to crimes committed by
white men against the persons or property of the Indian
tribes while occupying reservations set apart for the very
purpose of segregating them from the whites and others
not of Indian blood.'
The result is that, in our opinion, the offense with which
the plaintiff in error was charged was punishable in the
Federal courts under §§ 2145 and 5339, Rev. Stat.
6. The only remaining question arises out of the exclusion by the trial judge of testimony offered by the plaintiff
in error for the purpose of showing that one Joe Dick, an
Indian, since deceased, had confessed that it was he who
had shot Chickasaw. Since the circumstances of the
crime, as detailed in the evidence for the Government,
strongly tended to exclude the theory that more than one
person participated in the shooting, the Dick confession,
if admissible, would have directly tended to exculpate the
plaintiff in error. By way of foundation for the offer,
plaintiff in error showed at the trial that Dick was dead,
thereby accounting for his not being called as a witness,
and showed in addition certain circumstances that, it
was claimed, pointed to him as the guilty man, viz., that
he lived in the vicinity and therefore presumably knew
the habits of Chickasaw; that the human tracks upon a
sand bar at the scene of the crime led in the direction of
an acorn camp where Dick was stopping at the time,
rather than in the direction of the home of the plaintiff in
error; and that beside the track there was at one point an
impression as of a person sitting down, indicating, as
claimed, a stop caused by shortness of breath, which would
be natural to Dick, who was shown to have been a sufferer
from consumption.

DONNELLY v. UNITED STATES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Hearsay evidence, with a few well recognized exceptions, is excluded by courts that adhere to the principles
of the common law. The chief grounds of its exclusion
are, that the reported declaration (if in fact made) is
made without the sanction of an oath, with no responsibility on the part of the declarant for error or falsification,
without opportunity for the court, jury, or parties to observe the demeanor and temperament of the witness, and
to search his motives and test his accuracy and veracity
by cross-examination, these being most important safeguards of the truth, where a witness testifies in person,
and as of his own knowledge; and, moreover, he who
swears in court to the extra-judicial declaration does so
(especially where the alleged declarant is dead) free from
the embarrassment of present contradiction and with
little or no danger of successful prosecution for perjury.
It is commonly recognized that this double relaxation of
the ordinary safeguards must very greatly multiply the
probabilities of error, and that hearsay evidence is an
unsafe reliance in a court of justice.
One of the exceptions to the rule excluding it is that
which permits the reception, under certain circumstances
and for limited purposes, of declarations of third parties
made contrary to their own interest; but it is almost universally held that this must be an interest of a pecuniary
character; and the fact that the declaration, alleged to
have been thus extra-judicially made, would probably
subject the declarant to a criminal liability is held not
to be sufficient to constitute it an exception to the rule
against hearsay evidence. So it was held in two notable
cases in the House of Lords- Berkeley Peerage Case (1811),
4 Camp. 401; Sussex Peerage Case (1844), 11 Cl. & Fin. 85,
103, 109; 8 Eng. Reprint, 1034, 1042,-recognized as of
controlling authority in the courts of England.

Opinion of the Court.

declarant was shown to be deceased at the time of the
trial. In West v. State the defendant offered to prove by
a witness that he heard one Jones say on his death bed
that he had killed Wilson, the deceased. The Supreme
Court sustained the ruling of the trial judge excluding
the evidence. In Davis v. Commonwealth, the offer excluded was to prove by a witness that one Pearl confessed
to him on his death bed that he had killed the person for
whose murder Davis was on trial. The Court of Appeals
of Kentucky affirmed the conviction. In People v. Hall it
appeared that defendant and one Kingsberry were arrested together for an alleged burglary, attempted to
escape, were fired upon and wounded by one of the captors;
that a physician was sent for to treat them, and that
Kingsberry died from the effects of his wound before any
complaint was filed against either of the parties. "In his
own behalf the defendant offered to prove that after a
careful examination the physician was satisfied that Kingsberry's wounds were necessarily fatal, and that he so informed him at the time; that Kingsberry admitted to the
physician that he fully realized that he was mortally
wounded and was on the point of death, and had given
up all hope of ever getting well; that he was conscious of
death, and that thus having a sense of impending death,
and without hope of reward, he made a full, free, and complete confession to said physician in relation to this alleged crime, stating that he himself had planned the entire
scheme, and that Hall had nothing to do with it and was
not connected with the guilt, and was in all respects innocent of any criminal act or intent in the matter." This
evidence was excluded, and the Supreme Court of California sustained the ruling, saying: "The rule is settled
beyond controversy that in a prosecution for crime the
declaration of another person that he committed the
crime is not admissible. Proof of such declarationg is
mere hearsay evidence, and is always excluded, whether

the person making it be dead or not" (citing cases that
are among those included in the note).
We do not considei it necessary to further review the
authorities, for we deem it settled by repeated decisions of
this court, commencing at an early period, that declarations of this character are to be excluded as hearsay.
Mima Queen and Child v. Hepburn (1813), 7 Cranch,
290, 295, 296, 297, was a suit in which the petitioners
claimed freedom, and certain depositions were rejected by
the trial court as hearsay. This court, speaking through
Chief Justice Marshall, said: "These several opinions of
the court (meaning the trial court) depend on one general
principle. The decision of which determines them all.
It is this: that hearsay evidence is incompetent to establish any specific fact, which fact is in its nature susceptible
of being proved by witnesses who speak from their own
knowledge. . . . It was very justly observed by a
great judge 1 that 'all questions upon the rules of evidence
are of vast importance to all orders and degrees of men;
our lives, our liberty, and our property are all concerned in
the support of these rules, which have been matured by
the wisdom of ages, and are now revered from their
antiquity and the good sense in which they are founded.'
One of these rules is that 'hearsay' evidence is in its own
nature inadmissible. That this species of testimony supposes some better testimony which might be adduced in
the particular case, is not the sole ground of its exclusion.
Its intrinsic weakness, its incompetency to satisfy the
mind of the existence of the fact, and the frauds which
might be practiced under its cover combine to support the
rule that hearsay evidence is totally inadmissible. . .
The danger of admitting hearsay evidence is sufficient to
admonish courts of justice against lightly yielding to the

introduction of fresh exceptions to an old and wellestablished rule; the value of which is felt and acknowledged by all. If the circumstance that the eye witnesses
of any fact be dead should justify the introduction of
testimony to establish that fact from hearsay, no man
could feel safe in any property, a claim to which might
be supported by proof so easily obtained. . . . This
court is not inclined to extend the exceptions further than
they have already been carried."
This decision was adhered to in Davis v. Wood (1816), 1
Wheat. 6, 8; Lessee of Scott v. Ratliffe (1831), 5 Pet. 81,
86; Ellicott v. Pearl (1836), 10 Pet. 412, 436, 437; Wilson

The confession of Joe Dick, since deceased, that he
committed the murder for which the plaintiff in error
was tried, coupled with circumstances pointing to its
truth, would have a very strong tendency to make any
one outside of a court of justice believe that Donnelly did
not commit the crime. I say this, of course, on the supposition that it should be proved that the confession really
was made, and that there was no ground for connecting

law. There is no decision by this court against the admissibility of such' a confession; the English cases since
the separation of the two countries do not bind us; the
exception to the hearsay rule in the case of declarations
against interest is well known; no other statement is so
much against interest as a confession of murder, it is far
more calculated to convince than dying declarations,
which would be let in to hang a man, Mattox v. United
States, 146 U. S. 140; and when we surround the accused
with so many safeguards, some of which seem to me excessive, I think we ought to give him the benefit of a fact
that, if proved, commonly would have such weight. The
history of the law and the arguments against the English
doctrine are so well and fully stated by Mr. Wigmore
that there is no need ,to set them forth at greater length.

An order of the United States Circuit Court remanding the cause to
the state court is not reviewable here, Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Fitzgerald, 160 U. S. 556, nor can this object be accomplished by indirection.
Where the state court, in denying a second petition for removal, simply
bows to the decision of the Federal court when it remanded the
record after the first attempt to remove, it does not deny any Federal
right of the petitioner within the meaning of § 709, Rev. Stat.
Where the second petition to remove presents no different question
from that presented by the first, it is proper for the state court to
follow the decision of the Federal court remanding the record and

deny the petition.
