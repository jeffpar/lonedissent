ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS.

Nos. 254, 255, 256.

Argued April 24, 1913.-Decided May 5, 1913.

Where, the act originally purports to be done in the name and by the
authority of the State, a defect in that authority may be cured by
the subsequent adoption of the act.
The deportation of a Chinaman from the Philippine Islands by the
Governor General prior to an act of the legislature authorizing such
deportation is to be considered as having been ordered in pursuance
of such statute.
Sovereign states have inherent power to deport aliens, and Congress
is not deprived of this power by the Constitution of the United

States.
The ground on which the power to deport aliens rests necessitates that
it may have to be exercised in a summary manner by executive
officers.
Congress not being prevented y the Constitution from deporting

aliens, the Philippine Govenrment cannot be prevented from so
doing by the Bill of Rights incorporated in the act of July 1, 1902.
The deportation of aliens in this case, by the Philippine Government
was not a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.
,The local governmeht of the Philippine Islands has all civil and judicial
power necessary to govern the Islands, and this includes the power
to deport aliens.
The extension by Congress of the Chinese Exclusion and Immigration
Laws to the Philippine Islands does not prevent the Government of
the Islands passing an act removing aliens therefroin.
The English rule is that an act of state is not cognizable in any municipal court. It is within the power of the legislature of the Philippine Islands to declare an act of the executive Which is within its
power to authorize to be not subject to question or review.
A statute which protects the executive protects the subordinates as
well as the chief executive.
Quwre whether the Governor of the Philippine Islands has authorit, by
virtue of his office alone to deport aliens, or immunity from action for
a deportation made in good faith whether he had the power or not.
Quwre whether, historically speaking, prohibition was the proper
remedy; but in this case this court should not interfere with the local
practice in a matter relating to the administration of local statutes
except for good cause shown.
The act of the Philippine legislature passed April 19, 1910, ratifying
the action of the Governor General in ordering the deportation of
plaintiffs, Chinamen, and declaring it to have been an exercise of
authority vested in him '-y law in all respects legal and not subject
to question or review, was within the power of the legislature, and
took from the court, in wh- . an action had been brought to enjoin
the deportation, jurisdiction to try the case, and the judgment granting a writ of prohibition is affirmed.

T~m facts, which involve the power of the Philippine
Government to deport aliens, are stated in the opinion.

The Philippine Government, however, is not a sovereign community, at least in an international sense, but a
mere dependency of the United States, limited to the
exercise of such powers only as.those with which it is
vested by its organic act. Act of Congress July 1, 1902;

Since the source of all power in the government of the
Philippine Islands is the Congress of the United States,
it must follow that if it has the power to expel aliens it
must have been granted that power by Congress, either
directly or by necessary implication.
While Congress may assign to Federal officers, either
in the United States or the Philippine Islands, the power
to execute the provisions of such acts as Congress may
pass regulating the exclusion or expulsion of foreigners
from territory subject to the dominion of the United
States, it is at least extremely doubtful whether it could

delegate to the Philippine government its sovereign power
to exclude aliens. Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, 121 U. S. 141.
In any event this power could only be exercised subject
to the limitation of the due-process clause of the Federal
Constitution and the Philippine Bill of Rights.
Congress has not delegated to the Philippine Government the power to exclude or expel foreigners.
The power was not delegated by the President's instructions to the Commission of April 7, 1900; the Executive
Order of June 21, 1901; the Spooner Amendment; or the
Organic Act of July 1, 1902. See 26 Ops. Atty. Gen.,
Dec. 10, 1906, pp. 91, 96; 24 Ops. Atty. Gen., pp. 534, 541.
Congress had already acted.
Aside from the absence of authority to be found in the
organic act of the Philippines conferring the right, Congress, both prior to and after the passage of the organic
act, had legislated for the Philippines regarding the regulation of the admission and exclusion of foreigners. See
act of April 29, 1902, making all the Chinese exclusion
laws in force in the United States applicable to the Philippi-ies; also § 33 of the Immigration Act of March 3, 1903;
§ 33 of the present Immigration Act in force; § 6 of the
act of February 6, 1905.
The regulation of the admission or exclusion of all
aliens into or from the Philippine Islands was a subject
never entrusted to that government or its officers (except
to the extent of enforcing the immigration and exclusion
laws of the United States applicable to the Philippines).
In re Allen, 2 Phil. Rep. p. 630.
The regulation of the conditions under which foreigners may enter into and reside in the territory of the
United States is incidental to the general and exclusive
power vested in Congress. to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580; Ekiu V.

Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

The Governor General of the Philippines has no such
power. United States v. Heinszen & Co., 206 U. S. 370;
O'Reilly v. Brooke, 142 Fed. Rep. 859, affirmed 209 U. S.
45, distinguished.
There being no power in the Philippine legislature to
legislate regarding the exclusion of foreigners from the
Philippines in the first instance, their action could not
constitute a ratification of what was done by the Governor
General.
The deportation of the plaintiffs in error was without
due process of law.
The subject of the exclusion or expulsion of foreigners
from any portion of the vast domains of the United States
is one over which Congress has complete control. Oceanic
S. Nay. Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 340, and other
cases cited supra.
Congress would not concede to a dependent community
powers inherent in the United States as a sovereign
member of the family of nations, and powers which the
various States of the Union have essayed in vain to exercise. Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283; Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U. S. 275; People v. Compagnie Trans., 107 U. S.
59.
The plaintiffs in error were entitled to maintain their
residence in the Philippines under the Chinese Exclusion
Laws and for these and other reasons their deportation,
was illegal and without due process of law.

Gordon and Mr. George A. Malcolm were on the brief,, for

Opinion of the Court.

General of the Philippines, Trowbridge Chief of te.
Secret Service of Manila and Harding Chief of Police of
the same; that the plaintiff was a Chinese person lawfully
resident in the Philippines, and' that the defendants forcibly deported the plaintiff to China and forcibly prevented
his return for some months; that -the plaintiff returned
on March 29, 1910, and that the defendants threatened
and were trying to expel the plaintiff again-Trowbridge
and Harding acting throughout under the order of the
defendant Forbes. There was a prayer for an injunction
and damages. The defendants demurred but the demurrer
was overruled and a temporary injunction granted.
Thereupon Forbes, Harding and Trowbridge sued for
writs of prohibition .against the judge and the-respective
plaintiffs, alleging that the expulsion was carried out in
the public interest and at the request of the proper representative of the Chinese Government in the Philippines,
and was immediately reported to the Secretary of War.
The complaints were demurred to, but the Supreme Court
overruled the demurrers, granted the prohibition, and
ordered the actions dismissed. The judge having declined
to join in the applications for writs of error, was made a
respondent, and the cases are here on the ground that the
plaintiffs have been deprived of liberty without due process of law. Act of Congress, July 1, 1902, c. 1369, § 5. 32
Stat. 691, 692.
The purpose of the first suits, of course, was to make
the Governor General personally answerable in damages
for acts done by him by color of his office and in pursuance
of what he deemed to be his duty, as well as to prevent
his exercising similar power in the future. This sufficiently
appears by the declarations, -which suggest and do not,
exclude official action, and is alleged in the complaints
for prohibition. On April 19, 1910 (Acts of Phil. Leg.,
No. 1986) in less than three weeks after the original suits
were brought, the Philippine legislature passed an act

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

which, reciting that the Governor General had authorized
the deportation 'in the exercise of authority vested in
him by law,' enacted, that his action was "approved,
ratified, confirmed, and in all respects declared legal and
not subject to question or review." So that if ratification
by that body can dispose of the matter no court has authority to entertain the suits.
The first doubt that naturally would occur is whether if
a right of action had vested previously it could be taken
away by such a statute. But it generally is recognized
that in cases like the present, where the act originally
purports to be done in the name and by the authority of
the state, a defect in that authority may be cured by the
subsequent adoption of the act. The person who has
assumed to represent the will and person of the superior
power is given the benefit of the representation if it turns
out that his assumption was correct. O'Reilly v. Brooke,
209 U. S. 45, 52.

U. S. 370, 382. The Paquete Habana, 189 U. S. 453, 465.

Co., 219 U. S.92. Dunbarv. Boston & Providence R. R. Co.,
181 Massachusetts, 383, 385, 386.
Therefore the deportation is to be considered as having
been ordered by the Governor General in pursuance of a
statute of the Philippine legislature directing it, under
their combined powers, and it is unnecessary to consider
whether he had authority by virtue of his office alone, as
declared by the statute, or whether, if he had not, he had
immunity from suit for such an official act done in good
faith. The former matter now is regulated by a later
statute providing for a hearing, etc. No. 2113. February 1, 1912. On the question thus narrowed the preliminaries are plain. It is admitted that sovereign states
have ,inherent power to deport aliens, and seemingly that

TIACO v. FORBES.
228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Congress is not deprived of this power by the C6nstitution
of the United States. Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
149 U. S. 698, 707, 728. Wong Wing v. United States, 163
U. S. 228, 231. Fok Yung Yo v. United States, 185 U. S.
296, 302. Turner v. Williams, 194 U. S. 279, 289, 290.
Furthermore, the very ground of the power in the necessities of public welfare shows that it may have to be exz
ercised in a summary way through executive officers.
Fong Yue Ting v. United States, supra. United States v.
Ju Toy, 198 U. S.253, 263. Moyer v: Peabody, 212 U. S.
78, 84, 85. So that the question is narrowed further to
the inquiry whether the Philippine Government cannot
do what unquestionably Congress might.
As Congress is not prevented by the Constitution, the
Philippine Government cannot be prevented by the Philippine Bill of Rights alone. Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1369,
§ 5. 32 Stat. 691, 692. Deporting the plaintiffs was not
depriving them of liberty without due process of law,
unless on other grounds the local government was acting
beyond its powers. But the local government has all civil
and judicial power necessary to govern the Islands. Act
of March 2, 1901, c. 803. 31 Stat. 895, 910. Act of July 1,
1902, c. 1369, § 1. 32 Stat. 691. The forms are different,
but as in Hawaii the proximate source of private rights
is local, whether they spring by inheritance from Spain or
are created by Philippine legislation. See Kawananakoa
v. Polyblank, 205 U. S.349, 354; Perez v. Fernandez, 202
U. S.80, 91, 92. It would be strange if a government so
remote should be held bound to wait for the action of
Congress in a matter that might touch its life unless dealt
with at once and on the spot. On the contrary we are of
opinion that it had the power as an incident of the selfdetermination, however limited, given to it by the United
States.
By § 86 of the act of July 1, 1902, all laws passed by the
Philippine Government are to be reported to Congress,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

228 U. S.

which reserves power to annul them. It is worthy of
mention that the law under consideration was reported
to Congress and has not been annulled. The extension of
the Chinese exclusion and immigration laws to the Philippine Islands has no bearing on the matter. The right to
remain, for instance, under the act of April 29, 1902, c. 641,
§ 4, 32 Stat. 176, does not prevail over a removal as an act
of state.
It is held in England that an act of state is a matter
not cognizable in any municipal court. Musgrave v.
Pulido, 5 App. Cas. 103, 108. And that was the purport
of the Philippine act declaring the deportation hot subject
to question or review. As the bill of rights did not stand
in the way and the implied powers of the government
sanctioned by Congress permitted it, there is no reason
why the statute should not have full effect. It protected
the subordinates as well as the Governor General and took
jurisdiction from the court that attempted to try the case.
Whether prohibition is technically the proper remedy
historically speaking, we need not inquire. On such a
matter we should not interfere with local practice except
for good cause shown. In substance the decision of the
Supreme Court was right.
Judgment affirmed.
