failure to serve within the State. We are of opinion that
the record does not disclose an appearance by the defendant, or any submission to the jurisdiction that it
sought and had a right to avoid.

UNITED STATES v. NOVECK.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 169.

Argued January 25, 1926.-Decided May 10, 1926.

1. That part of Rev. Stats. § 1044, as amended November 17, 1921,
which provides a six year period of limitation "in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States," does
not apply where such fraud is not an element of tbe offense as
defined by the penal statute on which the indictment is based.
P. 202.
2. The Act of July 5, 1SS4, as amended, and Rev. Stats. § 1046,
fixing limitations for offenses arising under the internal revenue
laws, do not apply to perjury under Criminal Code, § 125. P. 203.
3. Section 125 of the Criminal Code, defining perjury, does not make
intent to defraud the United States an element of the crime. Id.
4. Therefore, a prosecution for perjury under § 125 is subject to the
three year limitation of Rev. Stats. § 1044, and is not made subject to the six year limitation by allegations of the indictment
showing that the false oath was made in an income tax return for
the purpose of defrauding the United States. Id.
Affirmed.

OCTOBER TERII, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

Mr. Ben A. Matthews for defendant in error.
M. JusTIcE BurIER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Defendant in error was indicted November 5, 1923.
The first count alleges the commission of perjury on
March 13, 1920,-more than three years before indictment. The District Court quashed that count on the
ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of
limitations. The case is here under the Criminal Appeals
Act of 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
The count charges "the crime of perjury as defined by
section 125 of the United States Criminal Code." That
section provides: "Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case
in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath
to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose,
or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true,
shall willfully and contrary to such oath state or subscribe
any material matter which he does not believe to be true,
is guilty of perjury, .
."
35 Stat. 1088, 1111. The
substance of the charge is that defendant in error on oath
stated that the income tax due from S. Noveck & Co.,
Inc., for 1919, was $1,484.84 on an income of $16,251.66,
whereas in fact the tax due was $45,664.91 on an income
of $124,127.13. And it is alleged that the perjury was
committed "for the purpose of defrauding the United
States."
Section 1044 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by
the Act of November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220, provides: "No person shall be prosecuted, . . . for any
offense, not capital, except as provided in section 1046,
unless the indictment is found . . . within three years
next after such offense shall have been committed: Provided, however, That in offenses involving the defrauding
or attempts to defraud the United States . . . the period

Opinion of the Court.

of limitation shall be six years." The amendatory Act
added the proviso. Section 1046, Revised Statutes, declares that no person shall be prosecuted for any crime
arising under the revenue laws unless the indictment is
found within five years after the committing of such
crime. The Act of July 5, 1884, c. 225, 23 Stat. 122, as
amended by the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat.
227, 315, fixes a three-year period of limitation for offenses
arising under the internal revenue laws of the United
States. Section 125 of the Criminal Code, under which
the indictment was found, is not a part of and does not
refer to the revenue laws. The limitations fixed in respect of offenses arising under those laws do not apply.
See United States v. Hirsch, 100 U. S.33; United States
v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78.
Plaintiff in error contends that, as the perjury in this
case is charged to have been committed in the making of
an income tax return, and is specially alleged to have been
committed for the purpose of defrauding the United
States, the offense is brought within the proviso to §1044,
and that the six year period of limitation applies. But
the alleged purpose to defraud the United States is not
an element of the crime defined in § 125, on which the
indictment is based. That allegation does not affect the
charge; it need not be proved and may be rejected as
mere surplusage. In re Lane, 135 U. S. 443, 448. The
construction of §§ 125 and 1044 contended for by the
Government divides perjury into two classes. It makes
one include offenses having the elements specified in § 125
and the other to include those containing the further element of purpose to defraud the United States. And that
would apply similarly to every offense to which the three
year period fixed by § 1044 was applicable before the
proviso was added. The effect is to create offenses separate and distinct from those defined by specific enactments. Obviously that was not intended. The Act of

204

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Counsel for Parties.

271 U. S.

November 17, 1921, merely added a proviso to a statute
of limitations. Statutes will not be read to create crimes,
or new degrees or classes of crime, unless the purpose so
to do is plain. The language in question does not require
the construction contended for. Indeed it is not at all
appropriate for the making of such classifications or the
creation of offenses. Its purpose is to apply the six year
period to every case in which defrauding or an attempt to
defraud the United States is an ingredient under the
statute defining the offense. There are several such
offenses. Section 37 affords an illustration. But perjury
as defined by § 125 does not contain any such element.
Judgment affirmed.
LEITER ET AL., TRUSTEES, v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 251.

Argued April 19, 1926.-Decided May 10, 1926.

1. A lease to the Government for a term of years, made without
specific authority of law, under an appropriation for but one fiscal
year, is binding on the Government only for that year. Rev.
Stats. § 3732; § 3679, as amended February 27, 1906. P. 206.
2. To make such a lease binding for any subsequent year, it is
necessary, not only that an appropriation be made available for
the payment of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly
authorized officers, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the original
lease, making a new lease under the authority of such appropriation for the subsequent year. P. 207.
59 Ct. Cls. 907, affirmed.
