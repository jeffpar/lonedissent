the saving clause in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and in the
two sections of the Judicial Code, and that the more
reasonable view is that it is intended to regulate venue
and not to deal with jurisdiction as between federal and
state courts. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, pp.
384, 391; Re East River Co., 266 U. S. 355, 368; Engel
v. Davenport, ante, p. 33.
We well might have rested our decision here on the
conclusion reached in Engel v. Davenport, where we said,
"It is clear that the state courts have jurisdiction, concurrently with the federal courts, to enforce the right
of action established by the Merchant Marine Act as a
part of the maritime law." But out of deference to the
elaborate presentation of the question in this case we have
stated and dealt with the several points advanced as
making for a different conclusion.
Judgment affirmed.
BERIZZI BROTHERS COMPANY v. STEAMSHIP
PESARO.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 334.

Argued May 7, 1926.---Decided June 7, 1926.

A ship owned and possessed by a friendly foreign government, and
operated by it in the carriage of merchandise for hire, in the interest
and service of the nation, is a public ship and is immune from
arrest under process based on a libel in rem by a private suitor;
and the District Court has no jurisdiction of the case under Jud.
Code, ยง 24, cl. 3, granting that court jurisdiction of "all civil
causes of admirality and maritime jurisdiction." P. 570.
Affirmed.

dismissing a libel in rem against a ship owned, possessed.
and operated for trade purposes by the Italian Government, for want of jurisdiction. See 277 Fed. 473.

tERIZZI BROS. CO. v. S. S. PESARO.
562

Argument for Appellant.

Mr. Oscar R. Houston, with whom Messrs. D. Roger
Englar and Ezra G. Benedict Fox were on the brief, for
appellant.
The distinction between the operations of a government
in its sovereign capacity while carrying on national
objects, and its operations in its commercial capacity,
for profit, has been recognized by the courts from
the earliest times. The Exchange, 7 Cr. 116; United
States v. Wilder, 3-Sumn. 308; Briggs v. Light Boats, 11
Allen 157; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152; The Davis, 10 Wall.
15; Long v. The Tam pico, 16 Fed. 491; In re Muir, 254
U. S. 522; The Pesaro, 255 U. S. 216; The Carlo Poma,
255 U. S. 219; Ex parte Hussein Lufti Bey, 256 U. S.
616; Ex parte City of New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490;
Ex parte City of New York, No. 2, 256 U. S. 503; The
Western Maid, 257 U. S. 419; The Sao Vicente, 260 U. S.
151; The Gul Djenial, 264 U. S. 90; Ex parte Transportes
Maritimos, 264 U. S. 105. This distinction, apparent
in all the above admiralty cases, exists also in other
branches of the law. Bank of United States v. Planters
Bank, 9 Wheat. 904; South Carolina v. United States,
199 U. S. 437; Los Angeles v. Los Angeles Gas Corp.,
251 U. S. 32; Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S. 458;
Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles, 262 U. S. 700; Bank of Kentucky v. Wistar, 3 Pet. 431; Penn. v. Bridge Co., 13 How.
518; Curran v. Arkansas, 15 How. 304; Vilas v. City of
Manila, 220 U. S. 345. Furthermore, in admiralty actions
this distinction between commercial and sovereign functions is all the easier to make and apply, and is in reality
fundamental; for in this country, under our theory of
actions in rem, the ownership of the vessel is in reality
immaterial, it being a well established "principle of the
maritime law that the ship, by whomsoever owned and
navigated, is considered as herself the wrongdoer liable
for the tort." The John G. Stevens, 170 U. S. 113.

564

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Argument for Appellant.

271 U. S.

That the immunity allowed property of a foreign
government is to be determined by the immunity which
this government demands for itself in regard to similar
property, is shown by The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat.
283; Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519; RussianSoviet
Republic v. Cibrario,235 N. Y. 255.
The policy of the United States, as shown in the Acts
of Congress, has been to subject government owned merchant ships to the same laws, regulations, and liabilities
as privately owned ships. The Lake llfonroe, 250 U. S.
246; Nahmeh v. United States, 267 U. S. 122; Shewan &
Sons v. United States, 266 U. S. 108; The Attualita, 238
Fed. 909; Workman v. City of New York, 179 U. S. 552;
United States v. Wilder, 3 Sumn. 308. Under the Italian
law no immunity is afforded to merchant ships. It would
certainly seem an anomaly to grant to the Pesaro an
immunity in our courts which she would not have in her
own country and which a similar ship, owned and operated by the United States, would not enjoy either in the
United States or in Italy.
A remedy in rem in admiralty against the property of
a sovereign may quite properly be recognized even though
" suit in personam would not lie against the same sovereign. United States v. Wilder, 3 Sumn. 308; The Davis,
10 Wall. 15; The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 283;
The Appam, 243 U. S. 124; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152;
United States v. The Thekla, 266 U. S. 328; Workman v.
City of New York, 179 U. S. 552.
It must be remembered that the conception of a maritime lien in England is quite different from the conception in this country. In England it is considered to be a
jus ad rem while in America it is held to be a jus in re.
See The Young M'eckanic, 2 Curtis 404. The difference
is fundamental and is well illustrated by the reasoning
of the court of appeal in The Parlement Belge (1880) 5
Prob. 197, the leading case in England upon the general

BERIZZI BROS. CO. v. S. S. PESARO.
562

Argument for Appellee.

question of sovereign immunity in admiralty. In fact,
that case is the very foundation of all the later English
decisions upon the subject. This difference has been
noted and accepted by our courts. Ramsdell Co. v. C.
G. T., 182 U. S. 406; The Eugene F. Moran, 212 U. S.
466. In England, the vessel is not liable for torts committed while in charge of a compulsory pilot, The Maria,
1 W. Rob. 95, whereas in this country the vessel is held
responsible. The China, 7 Wall. 53, and others. The
English theory, is that a right in ren is only a power in
the creditor to have the debtor's res sold in order to havie
the claim paid out of the proceeds. The ship is merely
security for the owner's liability. On the other hand,
in this country a right in rein is considered as a jus in re,
rather than a jus ad ren. The Youing Mechanic, 2 Curtis
404; The John G. Stevens, 170 U. S. 113. See also Brig
Mflekt Adhel, 2 How. 210.
Mr. Homer L. Loomis for appellee.
The question is whether ch. 20 of the Act of September
24, 1789, 1 Stat. 76, as now found in the Judicial Code,
ยง 24, cl. 3, conferring admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
on the District Courts of the United States includes, in its
grant of power, jurisdiction to proceed in rein against a
vessel of the type of the Pesaro; whether the Pesaro,
under that grant of jurisdiction, was subject to a maritime
lien. The Pesaro, 255 U. S. 216; The Carlo Poma, 255
U. S. 219. This is materially different from the question
whether the Pesaro, when in the port of New York, was
subject to the local jurisdiction. Tucker v. Alexandroif,
183 U. S. 424.
At the time of the adoption of the Act of September 24,
1789, it was a principle of law accepted.among all civilized
nations that sovereignty was not subject to suit, and it
was recognized and agreed by the founders that grants of
jurisdictional power embodied in the Federal Constitution

of the non-suability of a sovereign power was also then
considered as extending to the sovereign's property.

Exchange, 7 Cr. 116.
The grant of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
in 1789 has ever since been narrowly construed and never
extended by implication to cover a sovereign or his property. It has been construed as excluding jurisdiction
over suits brought, in the absence of consent, against sovereigns in personam. .Blamberg Bros. v. United States,

The legislative history of the United States confirms
the exclusion from the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of any remedies in rein against the public property
of a sovereign power. United States v. Morgan, 99 Fed.

States, 266 U. S. 108; Nahmneh v. United States, 267 U. S.
122; The Isononia, 285 Fed. 516. It follows that the
Pesaro, a public merchant ship of a foreign sovereign, is
exempt from the process in rem of the District Court.

17 Wall. 515; The Attualita, 238 Fed. 909; Ex parte

The Tervaete (C. A.) (1922), P. 259.
When a res is merely being employed to render public
service in the possession of a private person, pursuant to
some contract with the sovereign, no such difficulty exists.
Goodwin v. United States, 17 Wall. 515; New OrleansBelize S. S. Co. v. United States, 239 U. S. 202; Ackerlind

immunity can obviously cause no hardship. On the other
hand, to upset the determinative character, for purposes
of rights in rem, of possession and ownership, is to desert
old land-marks that have proved entirely safe and trustworthy guides in the past and follow a lead that, because

of the very vagueness and indefiniteness of the term" public service," apart from the substantial considerations
above discussed, may take us into endless confusion.

Wall. 15; Long v. The Tampico, 16 Fed. 491; United
States v. Wilder, 3 Sumn. 308; The Johnson Lighterage
Co., No. 24, 231 Fed. 365.
The Pesaro was necessarily employed in the pursuit of
public purposes or national objects; just as is any of the
merchant vessels owned and operated as such by the
United States. National objects embrace many ends
other than those of war and peace. To promote the general welfare is universally regarded as a national object,
and is specifically mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution as one of the six great national aims that the
founders saw in drafting that instrument. Cf. Vattel,
Bk. I, ยงยง 86-87. The national character of the objects
that a public, government-owned, merchant marine is
calculated to procure was recognized by Congress in enacting the law providing therefor, as those objects are
set forth in the preamble of that Act. Title Guarantee
& Trust Co. v. Crane Co., 219 U. S. 24; United States v.
Ansonia Brass Co., 218 U. S. 452; Tucker v. Alexandroff,
183 U. S. 424. Those cases distinguishing between the
public and private activities of municipalities are not here
in point. A real sovereign, a state, a nation, is always
sovereign. In none of its activities is it ever subject to
a higher human will, individual or collective.
The government-owned merchant ships of the United
States have been recognized to be public property engaged in public business and requiring to be immune from

Italy.
Courts other than those of admiralty have construed
their various jurisdictions as likewise excluding any power
to issue process against the persons of sovereigns or to
attach their property.

This was a libel in.

carriage to the port of New York. The usual process
issued, on which the vessel was arrested; and subsequently
she was released, a bond being given for her return, or the
payment of the libellant's claim, if the court had jurisdiction and the claim was established. In the libel the vessel was described as a general ship engaged in the common
carriage of merchandise for hire. The Italian Ambassador to the United States appeared and on behalf of the
Italian Government specially set forth that the vessel at
the time of her arrest was owned and possessed by that
government, was operated by it in its service and interest; and therefore was immune from process of the courts
of the United States. At the hearing it was stipulated
that the vessel when arrested was owned, possessed and
controlled by the Italian Government, was not connected
with its naval or military forces, was employed in tho
carriage of merchandise for hire between Italian ports and
ports in other countries, including the port of New York,
and was so employed in the service and interest of the
whole Italian nation as distinguished from any individual
member thereof, private or official; and that the Italian
Government never had consented that the vessel be seized
or proceeded against by judicial process. On the facts so
appearing the court sustained the plea of immunity and
on that ground entered a decree dismissing the libel for
want of jurisdiction. This direct appeal is from that
de~ee and was taken before the Act of February 13, 1925,
became effective.
The single question presented for decision by us is
whether a ship owned and possessed by a foreign government, and operated by it in the carriage of merchandise for hire, is immune from arrest under process based
on a libel in rem by a private suitor in a federal district
court exercising admiralty jurisdiction.
This precise question never has been considered by this
Court before. Several efforts to present it have been made

BERIZZI BROS. CO. v. S. S. PESARO.
562

Opinion of the Court.

in recent years, but always in circumstances which did
not require its consideration. The nearest approach to it
in this Court's decisions is found in The Exchange, 7
Cranch 116, where the opinion was delivered by Chief
Justice Marshall. There a libel was brought by citizens
of this country against an armed vessel in the possession
of French naval officers, the libellants' claim being that
they were the true owners, that the vessel had been wrongfully taken from them and then converted into an armed
vessel, and that they were entitled to have it restored
to them through a proceeding in admiralty. Diplomatic
correspondence resulted in the presentation by a law officer of this government of a formal suggestion in the suit to
the effect that at the time of the arrest under the libel the
vessel was claimed and possessed by the French Governinent as a war ship, was temporarily within our waters for
a lawful purpose, and therefore was immune from the
process whereon she was arrested. In the opinion the
Chief Justice attributed to every nation an exclusive and
absolute jurisdiction within its own territory subject to
no limitation not having its consent, observed 'that the
consent might be either express or implied, and then said
(p. 136):
"The world being composed of distinct sovereignties,
possessing equal rights and equal independence, whose
mutual benefit is promoted by intercourse with each other,
and by an interchange of those good offices which humanity dictates and its wants require, all sovereigns have
consented to a relaxation, in practice, in cases under certain peculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective territories which
sovereignty confers.
"This consent may, in some instances, be tested by conmon usage, and by common opinion, growing out of that
usage.
"A nation would justly be considered as violating its
faith, although that faith might not be expressly plighted,

572

271 U.S.

which should suddenly and without previous notice, exercise its territorial powers in a manner not consonant to
the usages and received obligations of the civilized world.
"This full and absolute territorial jurisdiction being
alike the attribute of every sovereign, and being incapable
of conferring extra-territorial power, would not seem to
contemplate foreign sovereigns nor their sovereign rights
as its objects. One sovereign being in no respect amenable to another; and being bound by obligations of the
highest character not to degrade the dignity of his nation,
by placing himself or its sovereign rights within the jurisdiction of another, can be supposed to enter a foreign
territory only under an express license, or in the confidence that the immunities belonging to his independent
sovereign station, though not expressly stipulated, are
reserved by implication, and will be extended to him.
"This perfect equality and absolute independence of
sovereigns, and this common interest impelling them to
mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices
with each other, have given rise to a class of cases in
which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise
of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every
nation."
After discussing the status of a sovereign, his ministers
and his troops when they or any of them enter the territory of another sovereign, he proceeded (p. 141):
"If there be no treaty applicable to the case, and the
sovereign, from motives deemed adequate by himself,
permits his ports to remain open to the public ships of
foreign friendly powers, the conclusion seems irresistible,
that they enter by his assent. And if they enter by his
assent, necessarily implied, no just reason is perceived
by the court, for distinguishing their case from that of
vessels which enter by express assent.
"In all the cases of exemption which have been reviewed, much has been implied, but the obligation of

BERIZZI BROS. CO. v. S. S. PESARO.
562

Opinion of the Court.

what was implied has been found equal to the obligation
of that which was expressed. Are there reasons for denying the application of this principle to ships of war?"
And then, after suggesting that there is a wide difference between the status of private individuals who enter
foreign territory, or send their private ships there for
purposes of trade, and the status of public war vessels
when in foreign waters, he further said (p. 145):
"It seems, then, to the court, to be a principle of public law, that national ships of war, entering the port of a
friendly power, open for their reception, are to be considered as exempted by the consent of that power from
its jurisdiction.
"Without doubt, the sovereign of the place is capable
of destroying this implication. He may claim and exercise jurisdiction, either by employing force, or by subjecting such vessels to the ordinary tribunals. But until
such power be exerted in a manner not to be misunderstood, the sovereign cannot be considered as having imparted to the ordinary tribunals a jurisdiction, which it
would be a breach of faith to exercise. Those general
statutory provisions, therefore, which are descriptive of
the ordinary jurisdiction of the judicial tribunals, which
give an individual whose property has been wrested from
him, a right to clahn that property in the courts of the
country in which it is found, ought not, in the opinion
of this court, to be so construed, as to give them jurisdiction in a case, in which the sovereign power has impliedly consented to waive its jurisdiction."
It will be perceived that the opinion, although dealing
comprehensively with the general subject, contains no
reference to merchant ships owned and operated by a
government. But the omission is not of special significance, for in 1812, when the decision was given, merchant
ships were operated only by private owners and there was
little thought of .governments engaging in such operations. That came much later.

574

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U.S.

The decision in The Exchange therefore cannot be
taken as excluding merchant ships held and used by a
government from the principles there announced. On
the contrary, if such ships come within those principles,
they must be held to have the same immunity as war
ships, in the absence of a treaty or statute of the United
States evincing a different purpose. No such treaty or
statute has been brought to our attention.
We think the principles are applicable alike to all ships
held and used by a government for a public purpose, and
that when, for the purpose of advancing the trade of its
people or providing revenue for its treasury, a government acquires, mans and operates ships in the carrying
trade, they are public ships in the same sense that war
ships are. We know of no international usage which
regards the maintenance and advancement of the economic welfare of a people in time of peace as any less
a public purpose than the maintenance and training of
a naval force.
The subsequent course of decision in other courts gives
strong support to our conclusion.
In Briggs v. Light Boats, 11 Allen 157, there was involved a proceeding against three vessels to subject them
to a lien and to satisfy it through their seizure and sale.
The boats had been recently acquired by the United
States and were destined for use as floating lights to aid
navigation. Whether their ownership and intended use
rendered them immune from such a proceeding and
seizure was the principal question. In answering it in
the affirmative the state court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Gray, afterwards a member of this Court, said
(p. 163): "These vessels were not held by the United
States, as property might perhaps be held by a monarch,
in a private or personal, rather than in a public or political character.

.

.

.

They were, in the precise and

emphatic language of the plea to the jurisdiction, held

BERIZZI BROS. CO. v. S. S. PESARO.
562

Opinion of the Court.

and owned by the United States for public uses." And
again (p. 165): "The immunity from such interference
arises, not because they are instruments of war, but because they are instruments of sovereignty; and does not
depend on the extent or manner of their actual use at
any particular moment, but on the purpose to which they
are devoted."
In The Parlement Belge, L. R. 5 P. D. 197, the question
was whether a. vessel belonging to Belgium and used by
that government in carrying the mail and in transporting
passengers and freight for hire could be subjected to a
libel in rem in the admiralty court of Great Britain. The
Court of Appeal gave a negative answer and put its
ruling on two grounds, one being that the vessel was
public property of a foreign government in use for national purposes. After reviewing many cases bearing on
the question, including The Exchange, the court said:
"The principle to be deduced from all these cases is
that, as a consequence of the absolute independence of
every sovereign authority, and of the international comity
which induces every sovereign state to respect the independence and dignity of every other sovereign state, each
and every one declines to exercise by means of its Courts
any of its territorial jurisdiction over the person of any
sovereign or ambassador of any other state, or over the
public property of any state which is destined to public
use, or over the property of any ambassador, though such
sovereign, ambassador, or property be within its territory, and, therefore, but for the common agreement,
subject to its jurisdiction."
Sometimes it is said of that decision that it was put on
the ground that a libel in rent under the British admiralty
practice is not a proceeding solely against property, but
one directly or indirectly impleading the owner-in that
instance the Belgian Government. But this latter was
given as an additional and independent ground, as is
expressly stated in the opinion at page 217.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

The ruling in that case has been consistently followed
and applied in England from 1880, when it was made,
to the present day. Young v. The Scotia, 1903 A. C. 501;
The Jassy, L. R. 1906 P. D. 270; The Gagara, L. R. 1919,
P. D. 95; The Porto Alexandre, L. R. 1920, P. D. 30;
The Jupiter,L. R. 1924, P. D. 236.
In the lower federal courts there has been some diversity of opinion on the question, but the prevailing
view has been that merchant ships owned and operated
by a foreign government have the same immunity that
warships have. Among the cases so holding is The Maipo,
252 Fed. 627, and 259 Fed. 367. The principal case announcing the other view is The Pesaro, 277 Fed. 473.
That was a preliminary decision in the present case, but
it is not the one now under review, which came later and
was the other way.
We conclude that the general words of section 24,
clause 3, of the Judicial Code investing the district courts
with jurisdiction of "all civil causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction" must be construed, in keeping
with the last paragraph before quoted from The Exchange,
as not intended to include a libel in rem against a public
ship, such- as the "Pesaro," of a friendly foreign government. It results from this that the court below rightly
dismissed the libel for want of jurisdiction.
Decree affirmed.
