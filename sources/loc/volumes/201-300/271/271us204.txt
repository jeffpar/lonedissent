OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Counsel for Parties.

271 U. S.

November 17, 1921, merely added a proviso to a statute
of limitations. Statutes will not be read to create crimes,
or new degrees or classes of crime, unless the purpose so
to do is plain. The language in question does not require
the construction contended for. Indeed it is not at all
appropriate for the making of such classifications or the
creation of offenses. Its purpose is to apply the six year
period to every case in which defrauding or an attempt to
defraud the United States is an ingredient under the
statute defining the offense. There are several such
offenses. Section 37 affords an illustration. But perjury
as defined by § 125 does not contain any such element.
Judgment affirmed.
LEITER ET AL., TRUSTEES, v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 251.

Argued April 19, 1926.-Decided May 10, 1926.

1. A lease to the Government for a term of years, made without
specific authority of law, under an appropriation for but one fiscal
year, is binding on the Government only for that year. Rev.
Stats. § 3732; § 3679, as amended February 27, 1906. P. 206.
2. To make such a lease binding for any subsequent year, it is
necessary, not only that an appropriation be made available for
the payment of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly
authorized officers, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the original
lease, making a new lease under the authority of such appropriation for the subsequent year. P. 207.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This action was brought by the trustees of the Levi Z.
Leiter estate, under the Tucker Act,' to recover rentals
under four leases to the United States. The petition was
dismissed, on demurrer, for failure to state a cause of
action. 59 Ct. Cls. 907. The appeal was taken in January, 1925.
The leases, which were for space in an office building,
were made by the trustees and the Treasury Department,
in 1920 and 1921, for terms of four and five years, for the
use of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance and other federal agencies that were subsequently merged, in August,
1921, in the Veterans' Bureau. 2 The leases provided for
stipulated annual rentals, to be paid in monthly installments. At the time they were made, however, there were
no appropriations available for the payment of the rent
after the first fiscal year during the term of each lease;
and each provided that the term of occupancy should
extend to June 30, 1925, "contingent upon" the making
available by Congress of appropriations out of which the
rent might be paid after the current fiscal year; and that,
if such appropriation was not made for any fiscal year,
the lease should terminate as of June 30 of the year for
which an appropriation was last available.
On May 29, 1922,-before any appropriation had been
made out of which the rent could be paid for the next
fiscal year-the Director of the Veterans' Bureau gave
written notice to the trustees that the premises described
in the leases would be "vacated, relinquished and returned" to them on June 30. On June 1 the trustees
wrote to the Bureau denying the right of the Government
to terminate the leases, and stating that the surrender

would not be accepted and claim would be made against
the Government for their full period, whether the premises were occupied or not. By an Act of June 12, 1922,1
a lump sum appropriation was made for the expenses of
the Bureau, including rentals, for the next fiscal year,
commencing July 1. On June 30, however, the Bureau
vacated the premises in accordance with its previous
notice. All rentals due to and including that date were
duly paid. Thereafter, the trustees, being unable to
re-lease the premises, presented to the Bureau bills for
the rentals for July and succeeding months, the payment
of which was refused; and these claims were also disallowed by the Comptroller General. The trustees thereafter instituted the present action to recover the rent
claimed to be due from July 1, 1922 to June 30, 1923.
inclusive.
We are of opinion that the demurrer to the petition was
rightly sustained.
Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes provides, with
certain exceptions not here material, that: "No contract
or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made
unless the same is authorized by law or is under an
appropriation adequate to its fulfillment. . ...
And
§ 3679 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of
February 27, 1906, c. 510,' provides that "No Executive
Department or other Government establishment of the
United States shall expend, in any one fiscal year, any
sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for
that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money
in excess of such appropriations unless such contract or
obligation is authorized by law."
It is not alleged or claimed that these leases were made
under any specific authority of law. And since at the

Opinion of the Court.

time they were made there was no appropriation available for the payment of rent after the first fiscal year,
it is clear that in so far as their terms extended beyond
that year they were in violation of the express provisions
of the Revised Statutes; and, being to that extent executed without authority of law, they created no binding
obligation against the United States after the first year.
See Chase v. United States, 155 U. S. 489, 502, 503;
Sutta v. UnitedStates, 256 U. S. 575, 579; United States
v. Doullut (C. C. A.), 213 Fed. 729, 737; and Abbott v.
United States (C. C.), 66 Fed. 447, 448. A lease to the
Government for a term of years, when entered into under
an appropriation available for but one fiscal year, is binding on the Government only for that year. McCollum v.
United States, 17 Ct. Cls. 92, 104; Smoot v. United States,
38 Ct. Cls. 418, 427. And it is plain that, to make it
binding for any subsequent year, it is necessary, not only
that an appropriation be made available for the payment
of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly authorized officers, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the
original lease, making a new lease under the authority of
such appropriation for the subsequent year. This conclusion is in entire accord with Bradley v. United States,
98 U. S. 104, 114, 115. There, a building having been
leased to the Post Office Department for three years at
a stipulated annual rental of $4,200, subject to an appropriation by Congress for payment of the rental, and
Congress, before the expiration of the second year, having
made a specific appropriation of $1,800 only for the payment of rent for the third year, and the Department
having continued to occupy the building for the third
year, it was held the lessor could recover only the amount
thus specifically appropriated for the occupancy of the
building during the third year, and not the full amount
of the rent stipulated in the lease.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Statement of the Case.

271 U. S.

In the present case, in accordance with the notice of the
Veterans' Bureau that it would surrender the premises
on June 30, 1922, the Government did not occupy the
premises after that date. That is, although a lump sum
appropriation had meanwhile been made for the rental
expenses of the Veterans' Bureau for the next fiscal yearin which no reference was made to these specific leasesthe leases were not continued under this appropriation
for the next year, either by a specific agreement to that
effect or by the occupation of the premises. So, the Government did not become liable for the payment of rent
after the surrender of the premises.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is
Affirmed.
BOOTH FISHERIES COMPANY ET AL. v. INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.

No. 313.

Argued May 5, 1926.--Decided May 24, 1926.

1. The Wisconsin Workmen's Compensation Act, (Ls. 1921, §§ 239419,) which makes the findings of fact of the Industrial Commission
conclusive if there be any evidence to support them, does not
thereby violate the rights of an employer under the Fourteenth
Amendment by depriving him of a judicial review of the facts on
which an award is made against him, because the Act is elective
and does not bind an employer who has not voluntarily accepted
its provisions. P. 210.
2. An employer who has made such election, accepting the burdens
of the Act with its benefits and immunities, is estopped from
questioning its constitutionality. P. 211.
3. Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S. 287, distinguished. P. 211.
