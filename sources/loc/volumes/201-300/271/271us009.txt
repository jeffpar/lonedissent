the state courts. Compare Harriganv. Bergdoll, 270 U. S.
560. And we are of opinion that the transfer tax is deductible. It was primarily payable by the respondent
out of moneys and other property of the estate; and it
was so paid by her. While this lessens the amount for
distribution among the heirs, it cannot be said that they
bore any part of that tax. As well might it be claimed
that they paid the funeral expenses and debts, if any,
of the intestate. No part of the transfer tax so paid could
be taken by the heirs as a deduction in calculating their
federal income taxes. It follows that the amount of the
transfer tax paid in 1917 by the respondent was deductible in ascertaining the taxable income of the estate
received by her in that year.

EXECUTORS.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 470.

Argued March 18, 19, 1926.-Decided April 12, 1926.

1. In calculating the income tax on an estate during administration,
under the Revenue Act of 1918, federal estate taxes are deductible
from gross income. United States v. Woodward, 256 U. S. 632.
P. 11.
2. But where the estate tax, though it accrued during the income
tax year, was not paid until later, and the tax-payer's books were
kept upon the basis of actual receipts and disbursements-not the
"accrual" basis-, and the return showed such income only as was
received during the tax year, the estate tax was not deductible in
computing the taxable income of that year. United States v.
Anderson, 269 U. S. 422. Woodward Case, supra, distinguished.
Id.
3. Where claimants' right to recover money paid as income taxes
depended on their books having been kept on the accrual basis, the
burden was on them to prove that the books were so kept. P. 12.

to be regarded as decided merely because it might have been raised
and decided on the record. P. 14.

held deductible in computing the federal income tax of the estate
under Revenue Law of 1918. Keith v. Johnson, ante, p. 1.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Claims for an
amount paid as income tax.

Solicitor General Mitchell, with whom Messrs. A. W.
Gregg, Solicitor df Internal Revenue, and T. H. Lewis, Jr.,
were on brief, for the United States.
Mr. A. L. Humes, with whom Mr. Stafford Smith was
on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JusTicE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

November 28, 1918, Dellora R. Gates, a resident of
Texas, died testate; and, January 6, 1919, the County
Court of Jefferson County granted letters testamentary to
appellees. The federal estate tax accrued one year after
her death; and, November 26, 1919, the executors made a
return showing $2,927,762.64 due the United States under
the Revenue Act of 1916.1 They did not pay any part
of the tax in 1919, but paid $1,000,000, February 25, 1920,
and the balance May 27, of that year. Under the Revenue Act of 1918,2 the executors, March 14, 1920, made an
income tax return for the estate for 1919, showing a balance due of $905,225.73. If the estate tax had been

deducted there would have been no taxable income for
that year. In 1919, the executors paid an inheritance tax
of $357,739.34, which was imposed and became due in that
year under the laws of Texas.' If that amount had been
deducted, the income tax of the estate for that year would
have been reduced by $261,149.72. When the return was
made, the rulings and regulations of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the Secretary of the Treasury did
not permit the deduction of the federal estate tax or the
state inheritance tax; and for that reason the executors
did not claim that either should be deducted, and paid
the amount shown by the return. After the decision of
this court in United States v. Woodward (1921), 256 U. S.
632, the executors filed a claim for refund which was denied. The Bureau of Internal Revenue offered to allow
them to deduct the estate tax paid in 1920 from gross
income, in calculating the income tax on the estate, for
that year. The executors refused to do so and brought
this action in which they seek to recover the full amount
of the 1919 income tax paid. And, in the event that the
estate tax shall be held not deductible, they seek to recover $261,149.72, the amount by which the income tax
would have been lessened if the Texas inheritance tax
paid in that year had been deducted. The Court of
Claims held the estate tax deductible, and gave judgment
for the full amount.
It is established that, in calculating the income tax on
an estate during administration under the Revenue Act
of 1918, § 214(a) (3), federal estate taxes are deductible.
UnitedStates v. Woodward, supra. But the question presented by this case is whether, in calculating the income
tax for 1919, the executors were entitled to deduct from
the gross income actually received in that year the estate

tax which was not paid until 1920. The executors maintain that under § 214(a) (3) estate taxes are deductible if
paid or if accrued within the taxable year; and that the
estate tax, accruing in 1919 and paid in 1920, was deductible from gross income actually received in 1919.
When regard is had to other provisions of the Act, it is
clear that this contention is not admissible. Section 200
declares that "paid" means "paid or accrued," and that
the phrase "paid or accrued" shall be construed according
to the method of accounting upon the basis on which the
net income is computed under § 212. And § 212 provides that net income shall be computed on the basis of
the taxpayer's annual accounting period in accordance
with the method of accounting regularly employed in
keeping the books of the taxpayer (United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422); but if no such method has been
employed, or if the method employed does not reflect the
income, the computation shall be made upon a basis and
in a manner that, in the opinion of the Commissioner,
does clearly reflect the income. The return shows that it
was made on the basis of income actually received in 1919.
This indicates that the accounts were kept on the basis of
actual receipts and disbursements, and there is nothing in
the record to show that any other method was employed.
The burden is on the executors to establish the invalidity
of the tax. United States v. Anderson, supra. -They
have not shown that their books were kept on the accrual
basis. Assuming, as we must, that the accounts of the
estate were kept on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, the executors were required to make return
on that basis. Notwithstanding the option given taxpayers, it is the purpose of the Act to require returns that
clearly reflect taxable income. That purpose will not be
accomplished unless income received and deductible disbursements made are treated consistently. It was not
the purpose of the Act to permit gross income actually

Opinion of the Court.

received to be diminished by taxes or other deductible
items disbursed in a later year, even if accrued in the
taxable year. It is a reasonable construction of the law
that the same method be applied to both sides of the
account.
Appellees contend that United States v. Woodward,
supra, governs this case. The provisions of the Revenue
Act of 1916 and of the Revenue Act of 1918 which are
here involved were considered in that case. The cases are
much alike. Woodward died December 15, 1917, and the
estate tax became due one year later, but it was not paid
until February 8, 1919. It may be assumed that the return for 1918 included only the income actually received
in that year. The rules and regulations then in force did
not permit the deduction of the estate tax. If that deduction had been made there would have been no taxable
income. The executors paid the tax under duress, and
brought suit for the amount paid. The Court of Claims
held them entitled to recover, and this court affirmed the
judgment. The question considered and decided was
whether in ascertaining net taxable income the estate tax
was deductible. The opinion referred to the provision
which imposes the tax upon incomes of estates and that
part of § 214 which authorizes the deduction of "taxes
paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by
the authority of the United States, except income, warprofits and excess-profits taxes," and, in discussing the
clause defining the deductions permitted to be made, the
court said (p. 634), "The words of its major clause are
comprehensive and include every tax which is charged
against the estate by the authority of the United States.
The excepting clause specifically enumerates what is to
be excepted. The implication from the latter is that the
taxes which it enumerates would be within the major
clause were they not expressly excepted, and also that
there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes

were as well known at the time the provision was framed
Thus their
as the ones particularly excepted. . .
omission from the excepting clause means that Congress
did not intend to except them. The Act of 1916 calls the
estate tax a 'tax' and particularly denominates it an
'estate tax.' This court recently has recognized that it
is a duty or excise and is imposed in the exertion of the
taxing power of the United States. New York Trust Co.
v. Eisner, ante, 345." The question decided concerned the
character of the exaction; that is, whether the so-called
federal "estate taxes" were "taxes" within the meaning
of that word as used in the clause of § 214 quoted. The
government did not contend that, if deductible at all, the
estate taxes could not be deducted in that case because
the return was made on the basis of income actually received in 1918, whereas the estate tax, accruing in that
year, was not paid until 1919. That question was not
presented to the court for decision, and no such question
was considered or decided. It is not to be thought that
a question not raised by counsel or discussed in the
opinion of the court has been decided merely because it
existed in the record and might have been raised and considered. Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511. The Woodward Case does not support the contention that, where
the estate income tax return is made on the basis of income actually received in the taxable year, there may be
deducted the estate tax accruing in that year but paid in
the following year.
It remains to be considered whether, in calculating the
tax on the income of the estate, the inheritance tax imposed by the law of Texas and paid by appellees in 1919
is deductible from the gross income received in that year.
That law provides that all property, which shall pass by
will or by the laws of descent, shall upon passing to or for
the use of any person (with certain exceptions) be subject to a tax for the benefit of the State. We are of
