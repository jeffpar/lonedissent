Argument for Appellants.

BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS
ET AL. v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

No. 567. Argued January 18, 19, 1926.-Decided April 12, 1926.
1. The just compensation safeguarded to a public utility by the Fourteenth Amendment is a reasonable return on the value of the
property used, at the time that it is being used, for the public
service. And rates not sufficient to yield that return are confiscatory. P. 31.
2. Constitutional protection against confiscation does not depend on
the source of the money used to purchase property; it is enough
that the property is used to render the service. Id.
3. The relation between a public utility and its customers is not that
of partners, or agent and principal, or trustee and beneficiary.
The amount of money remaining after paying taxes and operating
expenses including the expense of depreciation is the company's
compensation for the use of its property. Id.
4. The law does not require the company to give up for the benefit
of future subscribers any part of its accumulations from past
operations. P. 32.
5. Assets of a public utility represented by a credit balance in the
reserve for depreciation can not be used to make up the deficiency
in current rates which are not sufficient to yield a just return
after paying taxes and operating expenses including a proper
allowance for current depreciation. Id.
Affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court granting a

temporary injunction, in a suit by the Telephone Company to restrain the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, of New Jersey, from enforcing confiscatory rates.
Mr. Thomas Brown for appellants.
Depreciation expense is a charge made against earnings
periodically to care for depreciation of the utility's property not covered by current repairs. Depreciation reserve
is the fund accumulated from such depreciation charges.
Knoxville v. Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, makes it clear that

271 U. S.

the allowance in expense for depreciation is required in
the interest of the bond and stockholders, on the one
hand, and the public, concerned with continuously adequate and proper service, on the other hand. It likewise
makes it clear that the measure of allowance is the sum
required to assure that "the original investment remains
as it was at the beginning," and that its purpose is "the
making good the depreciation" and replacing the units
of property "when they come to the end of their life."
It also makes it clear that the allowance cannot be considered profit, for it is taken by the utility before and in
addition to profit for the specific purpose above indicated.
It follows that the depreciation reserve is built up, not
merely in protection of the integrity of the investment of
the bond and stockholders, but in the protection of the
interest of the public in continuously adequate service as
well. This reserve is the property of the company only
in the sense that the legal title thereto rests in it, but its
right of property therein is qualified by the public interest in protection of which the reserve is built up.
If it were profit it could be added to capital or disbursed
to the stockholders in dividends, but it cannot be so used,
nor is it to be considered as part of the property of the
company which the latter absolutely owns. Louisiana

U. S. 410.
It must be remembered that in this case the court
assumed that the company was getting a fair return on
its property during the years when the excess in the depreciation reserve fund was being accumulated. This excess was accumulated unnecessarily, if not improperly,
and at the expense of the rate payers. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U. S. 165, distinguished. The
action of the Board is in accordance with the general
practice regarding the treatment of excessive reserves for
depreciation. Georgia.Ry. & Pr.Co. v. Railroad Comm.,

The court erred in holding that the appellants were estopped from inquiring whether there was an excess in
the depreciation reserve; and, finding such excess, from
requiring that such excess be absorbed.
Messrs. Charles M. Bracelen and Thomas G. Haight,
with whom Messrs. Charles T. Russell and Frankland
Briggs were on the brief, for appellee.
The requirement that the Company overcome an admitted deficit in its annual earnings by revising retroactively the depreciation expense actually charged in the
past is illegal, and would confiscate the property of the
Company.
In order to get rid of the shortage below a fair annual
return, the Board allows the Company, as an annual
depreciation expense, a sum substantially less than the
Board itself finds to be the actual, normal, currently
accruing depreciation, until an alleged excess of $4,750,000
in its " depreciation reserve" shall have been "absorbed."
The Company denies the existence of any excess. Moreover, the present balance in this account was built up
prior to the Board's order under service rates lawful at
the time when charged and during a period when no
depreciation expense rates had been prescribed by the
appellants or their predecessors in office.
There is no justification in law or equity for any such
treatment of the Company's past expenses. Newton v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

The Company's charges for depreciation expense are
regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and
its jurisdiction is exclusive; the order of the Board is,
therefore, invalid and its enforcement was properly
enjoined.
MR. JUSTICE BuTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the district courtthree judges sitting, ยง 266, Judicial Code-which granted
a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of
certain telephone rates.
The company owns and operates a telephone system in
New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. In the territory
served in New Jersey there is a number of local areas.
Service between telephones in the same area is exchange
service, and that between telephones in different areas is
toll service. The latter includes both intrastate and interstate business. The system is used to give exchange and
toll service to all subscribers. For about 10 years prior
to the commencement of this suit the rates in New Jersey
remained at substantially the same level. March 6, 1924,
the company filed with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, to take effect April 1, 1924, a schedule providing for an increase of rates for exchange service in New
Jersey. The Board suspended the proposed rates pending
an investigation as to their reasonableness. December 31,
1924, the increase was disallowed, and the company was
required to continue to serve at the existing rates. The
Board found that the value of the company's property in
New Jersey, as of June 30, 1924, was $76,370,000; that a
rate of return of 7.53 per cent. producing from $5,750,000
to $6,000,000 would be a fair return for that year; that
the amount charged by the company in 1924 for depreciation, $3,452,000, was excessive, and that $2,678,000 was
sufficient. And the Board found that net earnings in 1924
would be $4,449,000,-less than the fair return by at least

$1,300,000.

BOARD OF COMMRS. v. N. Y. TEL. CO.
23

Opinion of the Court.

The company's accounts are kept according to the uniform system of accounts for telephone companies prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Charges
are made to cover the depreciation in the elements of the
plant which for one cause or another will go out of use.
These charges are made month by month against depreciation in the operating expense accounts, and corresponding credits are entered in the depreciation reserve account.
When a unit or element of the property is retired, there
is no charge to operating expense, but its original cost less
salvage is charged to the reserve account. December 31,
1923, the company's books showed a credit balance in
depreciation reserve accounts of $16,902,530. This was
not set aside or kept in a separate fund, but was invested
in the company's telephone plant. The Board prescribed
a rule for the determination of depreciation expenses to
be charged by the company in 1925 and subsequent years.
It declared that the credit balance was more than required
for the maintenance of the property, and directed that
$4,750,000 of that amount be used by the company to
make up deficits in any year when earnings are less than.
a reasonable return as found by the Board. And it said,
"But having made such charges in the past, future
charges beginning January 1st, 1925 may be deducted
from the normal charge until such time as at least $4,750,000 of the excess is absorbed as hereinafter provided."
The effect of the order is to require that if total operating expenses deducted from revenues leaves less than
a reasonable return in 1925 or a subsequent year, there
shall be deducted from the expense of depreciation in that
year and added to the net earnings a sum sufficient to
make up the deficiency; then, by appropriate book entries,
the resulting shortage in depreciation expense is to be
made good out of the balance in the reserve account built
up in prior years.
On the application for a temporary injunction, the
company attacked the findings of the Board as to rate

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.

of return, property value, and expense of depreciation.
And it contended that the charges on account of depreciation in earlier years were not excessive, and that in any
event the company could not be compelled to make up
deficits in future net 6arnings out of the depreciation
reserves accumulated in thle past*
The record shows that the rates in effect prior to the
temporary injunction were not sufficient to produce revenue enough to pay necessary operating expenses and a
just rate of return on the value of the property. There

and included in its decision, giving a comparison of re1

Opinion of the Court.

which set forth in detail the estimated results for 1925
based on the same rates. The affidavit shows net additions to the company's property in New Jersey in 1924,
amounting to more than $13,000,000; and the Board calculates the return on $88,417,448 as the reasonable value
of the property. The calculation is made on three bases:
(1) depreciation taken at the company's figure, $4,128,000, (2) depreciation as found by the Board, $3,314,716,
and (3) depreciation allowed by the Board's order,
$683,430. The effect of the order is to deduct $2,631,286 from operating expenses found by the Board properly.chargeable for depreciation in 1925. This deduction
ismade at the expense of the property of the company
paid for out of depreciation reserves built up in prior
years. And it has the same effect on net earnings as
would the addition of the same amount of revenue received
for service. On the basis of the company's estimate of depreciation expense, the return is 4.12 per cent.; on the
Board's estimate it is 4.93 per cent.; and by increasing
net earnings $2,631,286, as directed by the order, it is made
7.53 per cent. It is conceded that unless, as directed by
the Board, depreciation expense is reduced below what
the Board itself found necessary, and net earnings are
correspondingly increased, the rates cannot be sustained
against attack on the ground that they are unreasonably
low and confiscatory. Appellants do not contend that
the rate of return from the intrastate business is or will
be higher than that resulting from the company's business as a whole in New Jersey. And the record supports
the claim of the company that the intrastate business, or
that covered by the exchange rates complained of, is not
relatively more profitable than the other business of the
company.
It may be assumed, as found by the Board, that in
prior years the company charged excessive amounts to
depreciation expense and so created in the reserve account

BOARD OF COMMRS. v. N. Y. TEL. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

balances greater than required adequately to maintain
the property. It remains to be considered whether the
company may be compelled to apply any part of the
property or money represented by such balances to overcome deficits in present or future earnings and to sustain
rates which otherwise could not be sustained.
The just compensation safeguarded to the utility by
the Fourteenth Amendment is a reasonable return on the
value of the property used at the time that it is being
used for the public service. And rates not sufficient to
yield that return are confiscatory. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 41; Bluefield Co. v. Public
Service Commission, 262 U. S. 679, 692. Constitutional
protection against confiscation does not depend on the
source of the money used to purchase the property. It is
enough that it is used to render the service. San Joaquin
Co. v. Stanislaus County, 233 U. S. 454, 459; Gas Light
Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 144 Ia. 426, 434, affirmed, 223 U. S.
655; ConsolidatedGas Co. v. New York, 157 Fed. 849, 858,
affirmed 212 U. S. 19; Ames v. Union,Pacific Railway Co.,
64 Fed. 165, 176. The customers are entitled to demand
service and the company must comply. The company is
entitled to just compensation and, to have the service, the
customers must pay for it. The relation between the company and its customers is not that of partners, agent and
principal, or trustee and beneficiary. Cf. Fall River Gas
Works v. Gas & Electric Light Com'rs, 214 Mass. 529, 538.
The revenue paid by the customers for service belongs to
the company. The amount, if any, remaining after paying taxes and operating expenses, including the expense of
depreciation, is the company's compensation for the use of
its property. If there is no return, or if the amount is less
than a reasonable return, the company must bear the
loss. Past losses cannot be used to enhance the value of
the property or to support a claim that rates for the future
are confiscatory. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston,

271 U. S.

258 U. S. 388, 395;'GeorgiaRy. v. R. R. Comm., 262
U. S. 625, 632. And the law does not require the company to give up for the benefit of future subscribers any
part of its accumulations from past operations. Profits
of the past cannot be used to sustain confiscatory rates
for the future. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258
U. S. 165, 175; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra,
396; Monroe Gaslight & Fuel Co. v. Michigan Public
Utilities Commission, 292 Fed. 139, 147; City of Minneapolis v. Rand, 285 Fed. 818, 823; GeorgiaRy. & Power

Commission, 277 Fed. 970, 980; Garden City v. Telephone
Company, 236 Fed. 693, 696.
Customers pay for service, not for the property used
to render it. Their payments are not contributions to
depreciation or other operating expenses, or to capital of
the company. By paying bills for service they do not
acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the property
used for their convenience or in the funds of the company.
Property paid for out of moneys received for service belongs to the company, just as does that purchased out of
proceeds of its bonds and stock. It is conceded that the
exchange rates complained of are not sufficient to yield
a just return after paying taxes and operating expenses,
including a proper allowance for current depreciation.
The property or money of the company represented by
the credit balance in the reserve for depreciation cannot
be used to make up the deficiency.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE took no part in the consideration
of this case.
