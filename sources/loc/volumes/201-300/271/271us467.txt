these questions is the constitutionality of the state statutes involved; and a substantial claim of unconstitutionality is necessary for the application of § 266. See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Garrett,231 U. S. 298, 304.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The defendants in error, two white men, were charged,
by an indictment returned in the court below, with the
murder of one Henry Roan, a full-blood Osage Indian
and a legal member of the Osage Tribe, committed "in
Osage County, in said district, in the Indian country
and in and upon the reservation theretofore and then
established by law of the United States for the Osage
Tribe of Indians, on and in a certain tract of land therein
which was then and there under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and comprised a restricted surplus allotment, theretofore made under and according to

UNITED STATES v. RAMSEY.
467

Opinion of the Court.

the act of Congress approved June 28, 1906,
the
title to which said allotment
.
was held in trust
by the United States and was inalienable" by the allottee, who had never had issued to her a certificate of competency authorizing her to sell the allotment. The indictment is drawn under § 2145 R. S., which extends the
general laws of the United States as to the punishment
of crimes committed in any place within the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, to the Indian country, with certain exceptions not material here.
The court below sustained a demurrer to this indictment
upon the ground that the allotment described in the
indictment as the locus of the crime was not Indian
country within the meaning of § 2145. Thereupon, the
construction of the statute upon which the indictment is
drawn being involved, the case was brought here on writ
of error under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2,
1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
The authority of the United States under § 2145 to
punish crimes occurring within the State of Oklahoma,
not committed by or against Indians, was ended by the
grant of statehood. United States v. McBratney, 104
U. S. 621, 624; Draper v. United States, 164 U. S. 240.
But authority in respect of crimes committed by or
against Indians continued after the admission of the state
as it was before, Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S.
243, 271, in virtue of the long-settled rule that such
Indians are wards of the nation in respect of whom there
is devolved upon the Federal Government "the duty of
protection, and with it the power." United States v.
Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 384. The guardianship of the
United States over the Osage Indians has not been abandoned; they are still the wards of the nation, United
States v. Osage County, 251 U. S.128, 133; United States
v. Nice, 241 U. S. 591, 598; and it rests with Congress
alone to determine when that relationship shall cease.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

Mlatter of Heff, 197 U. S. 488, 499; United States v. Celestine, 215 U. S. 278, 290.
The sole question for our determination, therefore, is
whether the place of the crime is Indian country within
the meaning of § 2145. The place is a tract of land
constituting an Indian allotment, carved out of the Osage
Indian reservation and conveyed in fee to the allottee
named in the indictment, subject to a restriction against
alienation for a period of 25 years. That period has not
elapsed, nor has the allottee ever received a certificate of
competency authorizing her to sell. As pointed out in
United States v. Bowling, 256 U. S. 484, 486, there are
two modes by which Indians are prevented from improvidently disposing of their allotments. One is by means of
a certificate, called a trust patent, by the terms of which
the Government holds the land for a period of years in
trust for the allottee with an agreement to convey at the
end of the trust period. The other mode is to issue a patent conveying to the allottee the land in fee but prohibiting its alienation for a stated period. Both have the same
effect so far as the power of alienation is concerned, but
one is commonly called a trust allotment and the other
a restricted allotment. The judgment of the court below
turns upon this narrow difference.
In United States v. Pelican, 232 U. S. 442, a case involving the murder of an Indian upon a trust allotment,
this court held (p. 449) that trust allotments retain
"during the trust period a distinctively Indian character,
being devoted to Indian occupancy under the limitations
imposed by Federal legislation," and that they are embraced within the term "Indian country" as used in
§ 2145. But the opinion makes it clear that the difference between a trust allotment and a restricted allotment,
so far as that difference may affect the status of the
allotment as Indian country, was not regarded as important. The court said:

UNITED STATES v. RAMSEY.
467

Opinion of the Court.

"The explicit provision in the act of 1897, as to allotments,* we do not regard as pointing a distinction but
rather as emphasizing the intent of Congress in carrying
out its policy with respect to allotments in severalty
where these have been accompanied with restrifctions upon
alienation or provision for trusteeship on the part of the
Government. .
.
The allottees were permitted to
enjoy . more secure tenure and provision was made
for their ultimate ownership without restrictions. But,
meanwhile, the lands remained Indian lands set apart for
Indians under governmental care; and we are unable to
find ground for the conclusion that they became other
than Indian country through the distribution into separate holdings, the Government retaining control."
The essential identity of the two kinds of allotmentsso far as the question here under consideration may be
affected-was recognized in the Bowling Case, where it
was said (p. 487) that in one class as much as the other
"the United States possesses a supervisory control over
the land and may take appropriate measures to make
sure that it inures to the sole use and benefit of the allottee and his heirs throughout the original or any extended period of restriction." In practical effect, the
control of Congress, until the expiration of the trust or
the restricted period, is the same.
Since Congress possesses the broad power of legislating
for the protection of the Indians wherever they may be
within the territory of the United States, the question
presented is not one of power but wholly one of statutory
construction. Viewed from that premise, it would be
refers to c. 109, 29 Stat. 506, an act to prohibit the sale of
intoxicating drinks to Indians. It provides that the term Indian
country "shall include any Indian allotment, while the title to the
same shall be held in trust by the Government, or while the same
shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the
United States,
."

quite unreasonable to attribute to Congress an intention
to extend the protection of the criminal law to an Indian
upon a trust allotment and withhold it from one upon a
restricted allotment; and we find nothing in the nature
of the subject matter or in the words of the statute which
would justify us in applying the term Indian country to
one and not to the other.
It follows that the judgment sustaining the demurrer
to the indictment is erroneous and must be
Reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.

No. 268. Argued April 26, 1926.-Decided June 1, 1926.
1. Upon review of a judgment of a state court in a case under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act, this Court will examine the
record, and if it is found that, as a matter of law, the evidence is
not sufficient to sustain a finding that the carrier's negligence was
a cause of the death, judgment against the carrier will be reversed. P. 474.
2. Evidence considered and found to lend no substantial support to
the contention that the death of plaintiff's intestate, a brakeman
who was run over by a car in a train, which was in process of being
made up and coupled, was caused or contributed to by a pipe
near the rail, which the railroad company had negligently permitted
to remain in a bent condition. P. 474.
3. When circumstantial evidence is relied on to prove a fact, the circumstances must be proved, and not themselves presumed. P. 477.
4. It is the duty of the trial judge to direct a verdict for one of the
parties when the testimony and all the inferences which the jury
reasonably may draw therefrom would be insufficient to support a
different finding. P. 478.
