perjury without perjury. From this it follows that the
indictment does not state a crime, since it appears on its
face that the false oath stated to have been suborned was
taken in bankruptcy. The evidence does not prove subornation of perjury, but of a false oath in bankruptcy.

528-529; 2 Bishop New Crim. Law, § 1197a, § 1014.
Congress not unfrequently has defined instances where
false oaths are punishable, but not as perjury.
The perjury statute was in effect as R. S. 5392 when
the Bankruptcy Act was enacted. Thus we have an
earlier general act, followed by a later special act, each
act comprising a definition of an offense and prescribing
a penalty for it. The later special act removes such
offenses as are covered by it from the operation of the
earlier general act. United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88;
Lewis' Sutherland on Statutory Construction, pp. 480481. Then, too, the later act (Bankruptcy Act) fixed the
lesser penalty, and "in construing penal statutes, it is the
rule that later enactments repeal former ones practically
covering the same acts, but fixing a lesser penalty."
United States v. Yuginovich, 256 U. S. 450. It may not
be speaking with precision to refer to the Bankruptcy
Act as having pro tanto "repealed" the perjury statute,
because at the time the later statute was enacted the perjury statute did not cover false oaths in bankruptcy proceedings, for the good reason that there were no bankruptcy proceedings-there had not been a bankruptcy
act in effect since 1878, 20 Stat. 99, repealing Bankruptcy
Act of 1867. But the same principle of interpretation
applies. It indicates a legislative purpose to create a
new offense, and not to create a new species of the
existing crime of perjury. Looking at the section as

a whole, we see that the purpose was to create a scheme,
complete in itself, without requiring reference to any
other statute, for the punishment of every kind of misconduct in bankruptcy. The scheme was to create three
offenses.

If a false oath in bankruptcy can be prosecuted as perjury, then the rules of evidence governing perjury prosecutions apply. One of these rules is that the falsity of
the oath cannot be proved by the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness. Quong Ting v. United States,

theory of testimony is not a sound reason for the rule in
perjury cases. We believe that the question is practically concluded in this Court by the decision in United
States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430. Moreover, if the quantitative theory of evidence is the true basis of the rule of evidence, the modern decisions which permit the falsity of
an oath to be proved by circumstantial or documentary
evidence should require that such evidence be equally
strong and convincing as the direct testimony which
would be regarded as sufficient proof. Yet many cases
permitting proof by circumstantial or documentary evidence hold that the ordinary rule of evidence in perjury
cases is not applicable in such a case, and permit conviction whenever the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt. People v. Doody, 172 N. Y. 165; State v. Wilhelm, 114 Kan. 349; Walker v. State, 19 Ga. App. 98;

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner was indicted on three counts in the Southern
District of New York. A verdict of not guilty as to the
first and third was directed by the court. The jury found
him guilty on the second; and the court sentenced him to
the penitentiary for a year and ten months. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. 6 F. (2d) 786.
The second count sets forth that Annie Hammer was
adjudged a bankrupt on April 28, 1923, and that the
proceeding was referred to one of the referees in bankruptcy in that district. The substance of the charge is
that, October 25, 1923, petitioner suborned and induced
Louis H. Trinz to take an oath before the referee and
there falsely to testify that, prior to April 18, 1923, he had
loaned $500 to the bankrupt and that she had given him
a note therefor.

HAMMER v. UNITED STATES.

625

Opinion of the Court.

The petitioner contends that the making of a false oath
in bankruptcy is not perjury; and that, without perjury
there cannot be subornation of perjury. Section 125 of
the Criminal Code provides that whoever, having taken
an oath before a competent officer in any case in which a
law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered that he will testify truly, shall state any material
matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of
perjury and shall be fined not more than $2,000 and imprisoned for not more than five years. Section 29 b of
the Bankruptcy Act, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 554, provides
that a person shall be punished by imprisonment not to
exceed two years upon conviction of the offense of having
knowingly made a false oath in any proceeding in bankruptcy. Section 126 of the Criminal Code provides that
whoever shall procure another to commit any perjury is
guilty of subornation of perjury and punishable as provided in § 125.
It is plain that the offense charged includes perjury as
defined by § 125. That section is in general terms and is
broad enough to apply to persons sworn in bankruptcy
proceedings. The facts alleged include all the elements
of that offense as well as the making of a false oath in
bankruptcy; and they show a violation of both sections.
The indictment does not specify the section under which
it is drawn, but the omission is immaterial. The offense
charged is to be determined by the allegations. Williams
v. United States, 168 U. S. 382, 389. And it follows that
petitioner was accused of subornation of perjury. Cf.
Wechsler v. United States, 158 Fed. 579; Epstein v.
United States, 196 Fed. 354; Kahn v. United States, 214
Fed. 54; Ulmer v. United States, 219 Fed. 641; Schonfeld
v. United States, 277 Fed. 934. We need not consider
whether perjury committed in bankruptcy proceedings
may be punished by more than the maximum fixed by
§ 29 b, as the sentence imposed on the petitioner is less

271 U.S.

than that. Nor need we consider whether every false
oath in bankruptcy is perjury under § 125.
Petitioner also contends that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the judgment.
At the trial of petitioner, it was satisfactorily shown
that Trinz was sworn in the bankruptcy proceeding and
there gave the testimony alleged to have been false and
suborned. Trinz was the only witness called to prove the
falsity and subornation. He testified that he gave the
testimony alleged in the indictment; that it was not true,
and that petitioner suborned him. At the close of all the
evidence the petitioner moved the court to direct a verdict
in his favor on the ground that the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz was not sufficient to warrant a finding of
guilt. The motion was denied. And, on! the request of
the prosecution, the court charged the jury that the law
did not require any corrobation of that testimony; and
that, if believed, it was sufficient.
The question of law presented is whether the unsupported oath of Trinz at the trial of petitioner is sufficient
to justify a finding that the testimony given by him before
the referee was false. The general rule in prosecutions
for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness
is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of
the accused set forth in the indictment as perjury. The
application of that rule in federal and state courts is well
nigh universal.* The rule has long prevailed, and no
enactment in derogation of it has come to our attention.

HAMMER v. UNITED STATES.
620

Opinion of the Court.

The absence of such legislation indicates that it is sound
and has been found satisfactory in practice. On the issue
of falsity the case presented is this. On the first occasion
Trinz testified that he had loaned money to the bankrupt

and that she had given him a note. At the trial he swore
that his statement before the referee was not true. The
contest is between the two oaths with nothing to support
either of them. The question is not the same as that
arising in a prosecution for perjury where the defendant's
own acts, business transactions, documents or correspondence are brought forward to establish the falsity of his
oath alleged as perjury. That, in some cases, the falsity
charged may be shown by evidence other than the testimony of living witnesses is forcibly shown by the opinion
of this court in United States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430, 443.
That case shows that the rule, which forbids conviction on
the unsupported testimony of one witness as to falsity
of the matter alleged as perjury, does not relate to the
kind or amount of other evidence required to establish
that fact. Undoubtedly in some cases documents emanating from the accused and the attending circumstances
may constitute better evidence of such falsity than any
amount of oral testimony.

628

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

As petitioner cannot be guilty of subornation unless
Trinz committed perjury before the referee, the evidence
must be sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt
the falsity of his oath alleged as perjury. The question
is not whether the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz is
enough to sustain a finding that he was suborned by the
petitioner. It is whether, as against the petitioner, his
testimony at the trial is enough to sustain a finding that
his oath before the referee was false. Clearly the case is
not as strong for the prosecution as where a witness, presumed to be honest and by the government vouched for as
worthy of belief, is called to testify to the falsity of the
oath of defendant set forth as perjury in the indictment.
Here the sole reliance of the government is the unsupported testimony of one for whose character it cannot
vouch-a dishonest man guilty of perjury on one occasion
or the other. There is no reason why the testimony of
such a one should be permitted to have greater weight
than that of a witness not so discredited. People v.
Evans, 40 N. Y. 1, 3.
To hold to the rule in perjury and to deny its application in subornation cases would lead to unreasonable resuilts. Section 332 of the Criminal Code abolishes the
distinction between principals and accessories and makes
them all principals. One who induces another to commit
perjury is guilty of subornation under § 126 and, by force
of § 332, is also guilty of perjury. In substance subornation is the same as perjury. And one accused of perjury
and another accused of subornation may be indicted and
tried together. Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U. S.
480; Commonwealth v. Devine, 155 Mass. 224. Obviously the same rule of evidence in respect of establishing the falsity of the matter alleged as perjury must apply
to both. Evidence that is not sufficient to warrant a
finding of that fact as against the one accused of perjury
cannot reasonably be held to be enough as against the

ARKANSAS v. TENNESSEE.
620

Decree.

other who is accused of suborning the perjury. No such
distinction can be maintained. The rule that the uncorroborated testimony of one witness is not enough to
establish falsity applies in subornation as well as in perjury cases. People v. Evans, supra. Falsity is as essential in one as in the other. It is the corpus delicti in
both.
The trial court should have directed the jury to return
a verdict of not guilty on the ground that the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz at the trial was not sufficient
as against petitioner to establish the falsity of the oath
alleged as perjury. We need not consider whether his
testimony was sufficient to establish the fact of subornation.
Judgment reversed.
