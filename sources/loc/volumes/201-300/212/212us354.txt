to create a presumption in respect to the want of foundation
of an asserted, defense against a defendant who suppresses or
fails to produce evidence when legally called upon to give or
produce, our opinion is that the contention that the section
was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States is without foundation. In so deciding our conclusion is of course
based upon the legality and sufficiency of the order to produce,
made under § 8 of the act, and as our decision on that subject
rests upon the extent of the visitorial power which the State
had the right to exercise ever. a corporation subject to its control, our. ruling as to the legality of the call under § 8 is confined to the case before us.
Affirmed.

. THE FOLMINA.'
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 84.

Argued January' 21, 22, 1909.-Decided February 23, 1909.

When goods whi'ch were received in good order on board a vessel under
a bill of lading agreeing to deliver them,.at termination of the voyage,
in like good order and condition are damaged on the voyage, the

burden is on the carrier to show that the damage was occasioned by
a peril for which he was not responsible. Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How.
272.

Merely proving that damage to cargo was by sea water does not establish that such damage was caused by peril of the sea within the exception of the bill of lading; in such a case conjecture cannot take
the place of proof. The 0. R. Booth, 171 U. S. 450.

but in effect calls for a decision of the whole case, this court need not,
and in this case does not, answer it. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. v. Williams, 205 U. S. 444.
The question "whether damage to the cargo of an apparently seaworthy ship, through the unexplained admission of sea water, in the
absence of any proof of fault on the part of the officers or crew of the-.
ship, is of itself a sea peril within the meaning of an exception in a
bill of lading exempting the carrier from the act of God
loss or damage from . . . explosion, heat or fire on board
risk of craft or hulk or transshipment, and all and every the dangers
and accidents of the seas, rivers and canals and of navigation of
whatever nature and kind" answered in the negative..
The question "whether the ship is relieved from liability in consequence
of said exception," not presenting a distinct issue of law, not answered.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. FrederickM. Brown for Jahn et al.:

The questions submitted to this court for answer in this
cause are favorably controlled by The G. R. Booth, 171 U. S.
450. The only differences between the facts in that case and
the facts in the instant case are differences which make the

owner of cargo on the Folmina more clearly entitled to redress
than the owners of the cargo of the Booth. In. the Booth case
the carrier fully explained the entrance of the sea water; in the

present case the carrier either cannot or will not explain how
the sea water entered. In the Booth case the Circuit Court of
Appeals certified as a -fact that the steamer was actually seaworthy; in the present case it merely certified that there was
an appearance of-seaworthiness and that competent surveyors
could not discover any defect. In the Booth case the facts certi-

fied by the Circuit Court of Appeals excluded the hypothesis
of negligence on the part of the carrier or his crew; in the present
case the Circuit Court of Appeals has only certified that the

record contains no evidence showing negligence or fault on the
part of the Folmina's crew.
No other point of difference between the two cases has been
discovered.
It is just as certain in the case of the Folmina as in the case

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Argument for Jahn et al.

212 U. S.

of the Booth 'that there must. have been an efficient agency
or cause, permitting the sea water to enter. So long as that
efficient cause remains undisclosed, the courts cannot know
whether the damage comes within the scope of the sea peril
exception or not. As it is the obligation of the carrier, upon
fundamental principles, to bring the case within some contractual exception or.' statutory exemption from liability in
order to exonerate himself, it follows that the Folmina must
be liable, and the questions certiiied must be answered in the
negative. See also The Tlrunscoe (1897), Prob. 301.
Carriers should not escape liability for cargo damage without
establishing clearly and satisfactorily the cause of damage and
their right to exoneration. See The Mohler, 21 Wall. 230, 233;
Propeller Niagarav. Cordes, 21 How. 7, 25; The Caledonia, 157
U. S. 124, 144; Forward v. Pittard (1785), 1 Durnford & East,
27; The Edwin I. Morrison, 153 U. S. 214; The Mascot, 48 Fed.
Rep. 119; S. C., 51 Fed. Rep. 605.
Once. the carrier is able to show with the requisite degree of
clearness that the damage is of an excepted character, the prevailing rule is that he need go no further to establish affirmatively that he was free from negligence ,in the premises; the
shipper in this event having the- burden 6f proving negligence.
Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272.
Nevertheless, there is a very respectable body of authority to
the effect that even in this case it is contrary to public policy
to impose upon the cargo owner a burden of proof which he is,
from his inherent position, so ill adapted to bear. Pittsburg

The only inference properly drawn from the facts certified
is that sea water entered the Folmina, not owing to any sea
peril, but owing to the steamer's latent unseaworthiness or
owing to some undiscovered internal mishap similar to that
which occurred in the Booth case owing to some other cause for
which the steamer is liable.
The carrier having the burden of explanation, the legal inference from failure to explain is that sea water found entrance
to the hold of the Folmina owing to some cause for which the
carrier is legally liable. Nelson v. Woodruff, 1 Black, 156, 160;

that the, steamship was seaworthy and that the damage to the
cargo occurred without the fault of the master, officers or crew.
The language of the certificate is conclusive on the above
point. See also The Folmina, 143 Fed. Rep. 636.
The damage to cargo found to have been caused by the entrance of sea water into a seaworthy ship, without the ship's
fault, is "a loss by a danger or accident of the sea or of navigation," Within the meaning of the exception, even though it
cannot be determined, under the special circumstances, just
how the water got in. Montoya et al. v. London Assurance Co.

The true intent and purpose of the rule which ordinarily requies the carrier to give an explanation of damage to cargo, is
to require him to furnish such information as he may possess,
with regard :to it, in order that the court may be satisfied that
the loss has not resulted from his negligence or from the unseaworthiness of the ship.
Where, as in this. case, it is found that a cargo damage has
been caused by the entrance of sea water into the ship, during
the voyage, without the negligence of the ship's officers or crew,
and that the ship was seaworthy for the voyage; a prima facie

case of a loss by "a danger or accident of the seas or of navigation" is made out, and the reason of the rule is satisfied, even
though in the special circumstances, neither the carrier nor the
most expert of surveyors could determine how the water got
in the ship.
In the absence of any allegation of unseaworthiness by the
shipper, or of any attempted proof of it, or of faqlt on the ship's
part, the loss should be considered'to be within the exception.
MR.

JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

Upon the hearing of an appeal from a decree of the District
Court, Eastern District of New York, dismissing a libel, the*
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified to this
court for decision, pursuant to § 6 of the judiciary act of 1891,
the following questions:
1. Whether damage to the cargQ of an apparently seaworthy
ship, through the unexplained admission of sea water, in the
absence of any proof-of fault on the part of the officers or crew
of the ship, is of itself a sea peril within the meaning of an exception in a bill of lading exempting the carrier from "The act
of God . . . loss or damage from ....
explosion,
heat, or fire on board . .
risk of craft or hulk or trans-

shipment, -and all and every the dangers and accidents of the
seas, rivers and canals and of navigation of whatever nature or
kind."
2. Whether the ship is relieved from liability in consequence
of said exception?
The facts upon which. the questions arose were thus stated in
the certificate:
The steamship Folmina sailed from Kobe, Japan, for New
York with'a large shipment of rice on board in No. 3 hold, under
a bill of lading 'which contained the exception set out in the
first of the foregoing questions, and also a provision that the
ship "is not liable for sweat, rust, decay, vermin, rain or
spray."

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

212 U. S.

The rice was in g66d order when put on board, but when
discharged in New York a large part -of it stowed on the starboard side of the hold was found damaged. The area of injury
was downward from the first six tiers of bags to the bottom of
the hold, which was dry, forward from about the after end of
the hatchway nearly to the bulkhead, and inboard about threeor four bags. The damage was caused by water and consequent
heat.
A majority of the court are satisfied that the damage was
caused by sea water and that it was not shown that the vessel
encountered sufficient stress of weather to warrant the inference
that it came in because of the action of external causes. There
was no evidence tending to show any negligence, fault or error
on the part of the ship's officers or crew; the cargo was well
stowed and ventilated.
The Folmina was a steel steamship of the highest class in
Lloyd's register. Before starting for Japan she was in dry dock
at New -York and was there surveyed by Lloyd's surveyor.
Some time before she had been in dry dock at Cardiff, where
some repairs were made to the rudder, rudder quadrant and a
ventilator. The master testified to the general good condition
of the steamer at the time she sailed from Kobe.
During and after the delivery of the cargo the main deck, the
between deck, the pipes leading to or connected with No. 3 hold
and the shell plating in the wing of No. 3 hold were carefully
examined by the officers of the ship, by surveyors representing
the libellants and their underwriters, and it was afterwards
examined by competent and experienced surveyors representing both parties. The decks, hull, side plating and rivets of the
ship were found to be sound, intact and free from leaks. No
evidence (other than the mere circumstance that the damage
Was by sea water, if that be considered evidence) was found
that"there had been leaks in part of the frame, structure, side
plating, riveting, pipes or appurtenances of the ship, through
which water might have reached that part of No. 3 hold where
the damage was done. No adequate means of access of sea

Opinion of the Court.

water were found, nor any defect in the steamer which then appeared to be seaworthy.
The answer to be given to the first question will be fixed by
determining upon whom rests the burden of proof to show the
cause of the damage, when goods which have been received by a
carrier in good order are by him delivered in a damaged condition.
As said in Liverpool & Great Western S. S. Co. v. Phenix Ins.
Co., 129 U. S. 397, 437:
"By the settled law, in the absence of some valid agreement
to the contrary, the owner of a general ship, carrying goods for
hire, whether employed in internal, in coasting, or in foreign
commerce, is a common carrier, -with the liability of an insurer
against all losses, except only such two irresistible causes ai the
act of God and public enemies. Molloy, Bk. 2, c. 2, § 2; Bac.
Abr. Carrier,A; Barclay v. Cuculla y Gana,3 Doug. 389; 2 Kent,
Com. 598, 599; Story on Bailments, § 501; The Niagara, 21
How. 7, 23; The Lady Pike, 21 Wall. 1, 14."
And as observed in the same case:
"Special contracts between the carrier and the customer,
the terms of which are just and reasonable and not contrary to
public policy, are upheld-such as those exempting the carrier
from responsibility for losses happening from accident, or from
dangers of navigation that no human skill or diligence can
guard against.

"

It was long since settled in Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272,
that where goods are received in good order on board of a vessel
under a bill of lading agreeing to deliver them, at the termination of the voyage, in like good order and condition, and the
goods are damaged on the voyage, in a proceeding to recover
for the breach of the contract of affreightment, after the amount
of damage has been established, the burden lies upon the carrier
to show that it was occasioned by one of the perils for which he
was not responsible. But, as illustrated in the case of The
G.R. Booth, 171 U. S.450, proof merely of damage to cargo by
sea water does not. necessarily tend to establish that such dam-

212 U. S.

age was caused by a peril or danger of the seas. In that case
the facts were that the explosion of a case of detonators, which
were part of a cargo, burst open the side of the ship below the
water line,. and, the sea water rapidly flowing in through the
opening made by the explosion, injured the plaintiff's sugar.
It was held that although the explosion and the inflow of the
water.were concurrent causes of the damage, yet "the explosion, and-not the sea water, was the proximate cause of damage, and that this damage was not occasioned by the perils of
the sea within the exceptions in the bill of lading." As well observed by counsel in the argument at bar, the efficient cause of
the damage sustained by the rice on board the Folmina must
be sought in those conditions or events which caused or permitted the entrance of sea water; It cannot in reason be said
that sea water was the efficient, the proximate cause of the
cargo damage, because no other cause for that damage has been
disclosed. As there must have been an efficient cause permitting the sea water to enter, so long as that cause remains undisclosed it cannot be said that the damage has been shown to
have resulted from causes within the scope of. a sea peril. Of
course, where goods are delivered in a damaged condition,
plainly caused by breakage, rust or decay, their condition
brings them within an exception exempting from that character
of loss, as the very fact of the nature of the injury shows the
damage to be prima facie within the exception, and hence the.
burden is upon the shipper to establish that the goods are removed from its operation because of the negligence of the
carrier. But in a case like the one before us, where showing an
injury by sea water does not in and of itself operate to bring the
damage within the exception against dangers and accidents of
the sea, it follows that it is the duty of the carrier to sustain the
burden of proof by showing a connection between damage by
the sea water and the exception against sea perils. For the
distinction between the two see The Henry B. Hyde, 90 Fed.
Rep. 114, 116; The Lennox, 90 Fed. Rep. 308, 309; The Patria,
132 Fed. Rep. 971, 972.

THE FOLMINA.
212 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The inability of the court below to determine the cause of the
entrance of the sea water would imply that the evidence did
not disclose in any manner how the sea water came into the
ship. In other words, while there was a certainty from the
proof of a damage by sea water, there was a failure of the proof
to determine whether the presence of the sea water in the ship
was occasioned by an accident of the sea, by negligence, or by
any other cause. Manifestly, however, the presence of the sea
water must have resulted from some cause, and it would be
mere conjecture to assume simply from the fact that damage
was done by sea water that therefore it was occasioned by a
peril of the sea. As the burden of showing that the damage
arose from one of the excepted causes was upon the carrier, and
the evidence, although establishing the damage, left its efficient cause wholly unaseertained, it follows that the doubt
as to the cause of the entrance of the sea water must be resolved
against the carrier. The Edwin I. Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, 212.
And see further the following cases, applying the principle just
stated, and holding that because the damage to cargo was
shown to have been occasioned by sea water without any
satisfactory proof as to the cause of its presence, in view of the
burden resting upon the carrier, conjecture would not be permitted to take the place of proof. The Sloga, 10 Ben. 315; The
Compta, 4 Sawyer, 375; Bearse v. Ropes, 1 Sprague, 331; The
Zone, 2 Sprague, 19; The Svend, 1 Fed. Rep. 54; The Centennial, 7 Fed. Rep. 601; The Lydian Monarch, 23 Fed. Rep. 298;

653; The Presque Isle, 140 Fed. Rep. 202, 205.
So far as the second question is concerned, it does not propound a distinct issue of law, but in effect calls for a decision of
the whole case, and therefore need not be answered. Chicago,
B. & Q. Ry. v. 'Williams, 205 U. S. 444, 452, and cases cited.
The first question is answered No, and the second is not answered.
