we have said, rests with the complainant to prQve its case, and
it has not performed its obligation when this fact as to the disposition of the so-called depreciation fund is left so wholly in
doubt. What is the amount reserved for payments for depreciation? 'What, if any. of it, has been carried into capital?
How much of the floating debt would carry interest which
might be charged as against the amount of the depreciation
fund actually used for extensions and additions and charged
to capital? All these are questions not answered by the evidence in the case, and which should be made as clear as possible
before an attempt ought to be made to answer the question as
to rates. The whole case should, therefore, be opened, so that
both sides can, on a new trial, bring out all the material facts
upon which a decision can finally be based.
We, therefore, reverse the decree and direct a new trial.
Reversed.

McDANIEL v. TRAYLOR.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT CqURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.

โข

No. 70. Submitted January 12, 1909.-Decided February 23, 1909.

Where a number of claims are so'tied together by combination or conspiracy as to make the. relief sought in regardthereto one claim, the
aggregate amount of such claims will be the test of jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court; but if the plaintiff fails to prove such combination
or conspiracy each. claim must' be regarded as separate, and, as to
those which are less than $2,000, the Circuit Court has not jurisdiction.

An attorney must bp the agent of all to bind all'; and a plaintiff charging a conspiracy between certain claimants and an administrator

Argument for Appellants.

cannot satisfy the burden of proof which is on him to show that all
conspired, by showing that the same person was attorney for several
of the defendants, as no presumption exists that he was attorney
for all from the fact that, as attorney for the administrator, he advised the payment of all the claims.

THE facts are stated in the opinion,
Mr. G. B. Webster and Mr. J. R. Beasley for appellants:
The Circuit Court erred in holding that it had no jurisdiction because the confplainants failed to prove any joint act of
two or more of the defendants tending to procure the fraudulent allowance of their claims.
The gravamen of the charge in the bill was that the defendants conspired with the administrator and thereby procured
the allowances which otherwise would not have been made.
The evidence was that the attorney for the administrator
advised the latter to allow all the claims while he was, unbeknown to the administrator, acting as attorney for one of the
claimants. The present record discloses Williams as the attorney for all of those claimants, including that one which he
then secretly represented. These facts justify the conclusion
that in procuring the adninistrator to allow as expenses of administration what were not valid claims of any nature, he was
acting for all whose claims were so allowed,. If he was, then
his act was their joint act because done in their business and
for their benefit. Bethel Church v. Carmack, 2 Md. Ch. 143;

63 N. Y. 653; Griswold v. Gebbie, 126 Pa. St. 353; Craig v.
Ward, 2 Keyes, 287.
The law only requires the highest quality of proof possible.
Where the fact to be proved rests in the knowledge of the other
party and he stands silent when evidence is given of other
facts from which the ultimate fact to be proved may reasonably be inferred, it is to be considered as sufficiently proven.

In a case of this nature the value of the property upon which
the invalid lien rests rather than the amount involved in the
lien, is the true test of jurisdiction, The judgment allowing
these claims is a cloud i pon complainants' title. Smith v.

MR.

JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is the second appeal in this case. The first appeal was
on a question of jurisdiction, and is reported in 196 U. S. 415.
The object of the suit.is to set aside and to declare invalid the
liens of certain. judgments of the Probate Court of St. Francis County, Arkansas, upon certain real estate, and that the
defendants be enjoined from enforcing such judgments. The
judgments were, rendered upon claims against the estate of
Hiram Evans, deceased.

McDANIEL v. TRAYLOR.
212 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

James Evans was appointed administrator of the estate.
Among the assets which came to his hands was a drug store,
with its stock of goods, fixtures, book accounts and other
things, which he sold to John Evans on the first of May, 1891.
The latter conducted the business in his own name and incurred
obligations to the defendants aggregating $3,000.00, as well
as debts and obligations to other persons, but no single one of
his debts exceeded $2,000.00. John Evans became insolvent,
and on May 27, 1892, transferred to the administrator the
drug store and all that remained of the goods, fixtures and
book accounts. The bill alleged that the defendants "conspired, colluded and confederated together with John Evans
and the administrator to secure the payment of their claims
and demands against John Evans out ,f the estate of Hiram
Evans, deceased," and, "so conspiring and confederating,"
they presented to the Probate Court their several claims and
demands, and that the administrator, James Evans, fraud,ulently and illegally approved them for allowance against the
estate of Hiram Evans. And for like purpose, it was alleged,
they procured the judgment of the Probate Court, establishing
their claims by concealing from the court that they were debts
and obligations of John Evans and "cloaking the same under
the name of expenses of administration of the said estate, all
of which transactions were a part of the same scheme and
were participated in by each and all of the said defendants and
by said John Evans and James Evans, administrator." It was
further alleged that the judgments were wholly the result of
the conspiracy and confederation set out and the fraud practiced in pursuance thereof, and are in equity and good conscience void and ineffectual for any purpose whatever, and
ought not to be enforced, but that, nevertheless, the same arc
at law "liens upon the real estate" ddscribed in the bill, "and
charges against the respective interests of the plaintiffs."
There were other allegations showing that plaintiffs could
only obtain relief in equity.
The Circuit Court sustained a demurrer to the bill, being of

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

212 U. S.

opinion that the value of the matter in dispute was not sufficient to give jurisdiction. On appeal to this court, we said,
defining the matter in dispute and its value:
"The matter in dispute is whether the lands in which the
plaintiffs haye a joint undivided interest of one-half can be
sold, to pay all the claims, in the aggregate, which the defendants, by combination and conspiracy, procured the Probate
Court to allow against the estate of Hiram Evans. The essence of the suit is the alleged fraudulent combination and
conspiracy to fasten upon that estate a liability for debts of
John Evans, which were held by the defendants and which
they, acting in combination, procured, in co6peration with
James Evans, to be allowed as claims against the estate of
Hiram Evans. By reason of that combination, resulting in
the allowance of all those claims in the Probate Court, as ex-,
penses of administering the estate of Hiram Evans, the defendants. have so tied their respective claims together as to
make them, so far as the Plaintiffs and the relief sought by
them are concerned, one claim."
And we further said:
"That it was competent for the Circuit Court upon the case
made by the bill to deprive the defendants, acting in combination and claiming the benefit of the orders made in the Probate
Court allowing their respective claims. That the value of the
matter in dispute in the Circuit Court was the 'aggregate
amount of all the claims so allowed against the estate of Hiram
Evans."
The decree of the Circuit Court was reversed with directions
to set aside the order dismissing the bill and to overrule the demurrer.
Upon the return of the case to the Circuit Court defendants
answered, and the court, after hearing evidence, found that
there was a "total failure toestablish the fact alleged in the
bill, that the said defendants or any two or more of them, whose
claims in the aggregate exceeded the sum of $2,.0On exclusive
of interest, conspired and confederated together in procuring

Opinion of the Court.

the allowance of said claims, and therefore the court is without
jurisdiction."
On this ruling errors are assigned, and it is contended (1)
that an actual conspiracy was not necessary where the action
and conduct of the defendants,, acting by and through their
attorneys with the attorney of the administrator, were such as
to procure the fraudulent allowance of the claims; (2) that the
true test of jurisdiction in a proceeding of this kind is the
value of the property upon which the inequitable liens rest,
and not the amount of such liens.
The first proposition was decided adversely to appellants'
contention on the former appeal. As we have already seen,
it was the fraudulent combination and conspiracy which united
the claims and made the aggregate of the claims the matter in
dispute. By reason of that combination we decided the claims
were "so tied" together as to make them; "so far as the plaintiffs and the relief sought by them are concerned, one claim."
We further decided, "the validity of all the claims depends
upon the same facts. The lien on the lands which is asserted
by each defendant has its origin as well in the combination to
which all were parties as in the orders of the Probate Court,
which, in furtherance of that combination, were procured by
their joint action. Those orders were conclusive against the
plaintiffs, as to all the claims, if the claims could be allowed at
all against the estate of Hiram Evans. A comprehensive decree by which the plaintiff can be protected against those orders will avoid a multiplicity of suits, save great expense and
do justice. If the plaintiffs do not prove such a combination
and conspiracy, in respect, at least, of so many of the specified claims as in the aggregate will be of the required amount,
then their suit must fail for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit
Court; for, in the absence of the alleged combination, the claim
of each defendant must, according to our decisions, be regarded,
for purposes of jurisdiction, as separate from all the others:"
With this ruling the decision of the Circuit Court was accurately in accord.

But the finding of the court, that there was no combination
between defendants having claims to the jurisdictional amount,
is contested. "The specific and material charge is," counsel
say, "that there was an agreement or understanding between
the defendants on the one hand and the administrator on the
other." And it is contended further that parties may "conspire through their attorneys as well as in person." This may
be conceded, but the attorney must be the agent of all to bind
all, and the testimony does not establish such agency. It
shows only that the attorney for one of the claimants was also
the attorney for the administrator and advised him to allow
all the claims. It is not shown that he was the attorney of any
other claimant. It is, however, contended that it must be presumed that he was attorney' for all from the fact of his having
advised the payment of all, and from the fact that he is the
attorney for several of the claimants in this case. The presumption cannot be made. It was easy for appellants to have
shown that he was the attorney for the other claimants. He
and they were available witnesses, and as the burden was upon
appellants to establish the charge of the conspiracy, which
was the foundation of the suit, the presumptions are against
appellants' contention rather than for it.
Decree affirmed.

No. 100.

Submitted January 4, 1909.-Decided February 23, 1909.

When the Secretary of the Interior has jurisdiction of a land contest
and grants a rehearing he is not, nor is this court, bound by the facts
found by his predecessor on the original hearing, Potter v. Hall, 189
U. S. 292; after such a rehearing and when, as in this case, new testimony is allowed, the decision then made is the ultimate action of the
department.
