application to the courts of the United States or to the courts
of the State of Tennessee. But as the case now stands there
is no such certainty that the rates .prescribed will necessarily
have the effect of denying to the company such a return as
would avoid confiscation. For these reasonsThe decree is reversed and the case remanded to the court below

Rates, when fixed by legislative authority, for public service corporations, should allow a fair return upon the reasonable value of the
property at the time it is being used, but the legislative act will not be
issued stock. The consolidation was effected pursuant to the state
statute and the State has never questioned the validity or fairness of
the valuation. Since the consolidation the stock so issued has been
dealt in up to the present time as valid stock of the consolidated company, capitalized pursuant to the statute at not more than the fair
aggregate value of the property, franchises and rights of its constituent
companies. The State should not now be heard to question the value
of the franvhises at the time of the consolidation. The method of arriving at the value of these kinds of franchises, and how they should
generally be tested in the fixing of rates, are questions not now before
the court and are left undecided. The ease before the. court is decided
upon its own peculiar facts.
Second. The estimated increase in the value of these franchises as
made by the trial court at the time of the commencement of this suit
is only an estimate and is not based upon evidence sufficient to warrant the finding of any increase whatever over he. amount agreed upon
at the consolidation.
Third. The evidence leaves it in doubt whether the value of the
property used by the company in its business is as great as found by
the trial court after reducing the value of the franchises to the sum
agreed upon at consolidation.
Fourth. But taking the value as found by the court, after reducing
the -value of the franchises the result gives a return of almost 51 per
cent. A reduction in the value of the real estate, plants, etc., of a small
amount only would bring the return to, if not more than 6_per cent..
A possible increased consumption of gas would probably increase the
earning of the company without a corresponding increase of cost.
Under all the circumstances the complainant has failed to make out its
case with that degree of clearness necessary to warrant the interference
of a court of equity before an actual and bona fide test has been made
under the practical operation of supplying gas at the rates mentioned
in the statutes.,
Fifth. There is no rule as to any particular rate which any corporation subject to legislative control in the matter has a right to obtain
without legislative interference. It depends upon circumstances and
locality. In this particular case with reference to the risk attending
the businee and the locality where it is 'carried on, the. complainant

decl.a d invalid by the courts unless the rates .are so unreasonably
low that.their enforcement would amount to taking the property for
public use without compensation. San Diego Land and Town Co.
Cases, 174 U. S. 739; 189 U. S. 439.
Except in very clear cases, courts should not interfere with state rate
is entitled to a return, if it is possible; of 6 per cent upon the fair value
of its property actually used in its business of supplying gas.
Sixth. There is no discrimination between the individual consumerand the city, by fixing the price of gas for the city at five cents per
thousand'cubic feet less than is permitted in the case of individual consumers, so far at least as the complainant is concerned. If the amount
obtained from the total gas sold to the city and the individual is enough
to secure the requisite return upon the property, it is all the complainant can require and the question of discrimination between city and
individual is one in which the complainant can have no interest.
Seventh. The rate proposed must be with. reference to the value of
the property at the time when the rate takes effect. The company is
entitled to the benefit of any increase in value at that time. This at
least is the general rule, and if there be any exception to the rule, this
case does not come within it.
Eighth. Any increased expense arising from the increased candle
power of the light demanded by the statutes, was included substantially
in the expenses of the year (1905) with reference to which the inquiry
was made.
Ninth. The provision in the acts requiring a certain pressure is unconstitutional. The proof unquestionably shows great possible if not
probable danger of explosion in the mains or other pipes, if the pressure
demanded were applied to them as they now are. To eliminate such
danger would require strengthening all the mains and -other pipes,
which would involve an expenditure of many millions of dollars upon
which no return.could be obtained at the rates prescribed by the acts.
The provision can be separated, however, from the rest of the statute
and the balance thereof made valid. The pressure must-be sufficient
to produce a light of the candle power mentioned in the acts.
Tenth. If the court below is right in its construction of the penalties,
as to their amount, etc., such penalties are void, but are separable from
the rest of the acts and the balance can be effectually carried out. i.
Eleventh. This is not a case for the valuation of good will. The
complainant has in fact a substantial monopoly of the gas business in
the city of New York and those who wish to use gas must take it from
complainant. In this case, as there is no possibility of competition there
should be no allowance for good will.

legislation before the legislation goes into effect. Knoxville v. Water
Co., ante, p. 1.
Value of the property employed being an essential element in determining whether a rate is or is not confiscatory, and. being also largely a
matter of opinion, where the determination of the question depends
upon such value, a court of equity should hesitate to interfere by injunction to suspend the rate before it goes into operation and a fair
trial has been made.
Franchises of public service corporations are property and cannot be
takdn or used by others without compensation, and, where a State
has by legislative enactment permitted such corporations to capitalize.
.such franchises, their value. at the time of such capitalization should
be included in the value of the property as an element for fixing rates;
but no in'creased value of such franchises should be allowed.
Public service corporations, such as gas companies, are subject to the
legislative right to fix rates which permit not more than a fair return
on the property used.
Whether a rate yields such a fair return as not to be confiscatory depends upon circumstances, locality and risk, and no particular rate
can be established for all cases.
Under all the circumstances of this case this court concurs with the court
below that six per cent is a fair return on the value of property employed in supplying gas in the city of New York, and a rate yielding
that return is not confiscatory.
In estimating value of franchises for the purpose of fixingrates, it is immaterial that the corporation is taxed on a greater value than that
allowed if it charges its taxes as operating expenses in determining net
income.
.Where a public service corporation has a monopoly, such as of supplying gas in a large city, "good will " cannot be considered as an element
of value of the property employed.
For purpose of fixing rates the value of property employed should be
determined as of the time when the inquiry is made, and, as a general
rule, the corporation is entitled to the benefit of increased valu-e since
acquisition.
Twelfth. As it may possibly be that a practical experience of the
effect of the acts by actual operation under them might prevent the
complainant from obtaining a fair and just return upon its property
used in its business of supplying gas, the complainant, in that event,
ought to have the opportunity of again presenting its case to the court.
Therefore the decree is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill without prejudice.

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.
212 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

A provision in a state statute, requiring a public service corporation to
perform its service in such a manner that its entire plant would have
to be rebuilt at a cost on which no return could be obtained at the rate
fixed, deprives the company of its ability to secure such return and is
unconstitutional and void.
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, followed as to the unconstitutionality of
provisions in a state statute for penalties for violations so enormous
as to be overwhelming.
Provisions in a gas rate bill for rate, pressure and penalties for violation,
may be, as held in this case, separable and the unconstitutionality of
the provisions as to pressure and penalties will not affect the provisions as to rate.
Provision in a gas rate act establishing one rate for the municipality and
another for individual consumers is not an unreasonable classification
and does not render the act unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Where none of the different classes of consumers complain of different
rates the corporation cannot complain of such differences provided
the total receipts are sufficient to yield an adequate return.
Where, as 'in this case, in an action brought before the rate takes effect,
complainant fails to sustain the burden of clearly showing that a rate
act is confiscatory, the bill should be dismissed without prejudice to
right of the complainant to bring another action after the rate goes
into effect if it then proves to be confiscatory.
So held in regard to the New York Eighty-Cent Gas Law.
157 Fed. Rep. 849, reversed.

THE appellee, complainant below, filed its bill May 1, 1906,
in the United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of
New York against the city of New York, the Attorney General
of the State, the District Attorney of New York County and
the Gas.Commission of the State, to enjoin the enforcement
of certain acts of the legislature of the State, as well as of an
order made by the Gas Commission, February 23, 1906, to take
effect May 1, 1906, relative to rates for gas in New York City.
Since the commencement of the suit the Gas Commission has
been abolished and the Public Service Commission has been
created by the legislature in its stead. The official term of
Attorney General Mayer has also expired, and Attorney General Jackson. his successor, has been substituted in his place.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Statement of the Case.

212 U. S.

The ground for the relief asked for in the bill was the alleged
unconstitutionality of the acts and the order, because the rates
fixed were so low as. to be confiscatory. Upon filing the bill
a preliminary injunction was granted (146 Fed. Rep. 150), and
after issue was joined the case was referred to one of the standing masters of the court to take testimony, in conformity to the
practice indicated in Railroad v. Tompkins, 176 U. S. 167, 179.
A hearing was had before the master, who reported in favor
'of the complainant. The case then came before the Circuit
Court, and, after argument, a final decree was entered, restraining defendants from enforcing the provisions of the acts and
the order- relating to rates or penalties. 157 Fed. Rep. 849.
These various defendants, except the District Attorney, have
taken separate appeals directly to this court from the decree so
entered. The acts which are declared void as unconstitutional
are chapter 736 of the Laws of 190&, which limits the price of
gas sold to the city of New York to a sum not to exceed 75 cents
per thousand cubic feet. The act also requires that the gas
sold shall have a specified illuminating power, and a certain
pressure at all distances from the place of manufacture. Penaities are attachedto a violation of the act. The other act is
chapter 125 of the Laws of 1906, limiting the prices of gas in
the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, to other consumers
than the city of New York, to 80 cents per thousand 'cubic
feet, with like penalties as in the act of 1905, and with the same
provisions as to illuminating power and the pressure in the
service mains. The order which was declared invalid was one
made by the Gas Commission created under and by virtue
of chapter 737 of the Laws of 1905, the order providing that
the price of gas in the city should be not more than 80 cents to
consumers other than the city of New York. The order had
the same provisions, as to illuminating power and pressure as
the acts above mentioned. The master and the court below.
found that the 80-cent rate was so 16w as to amount to confiscation, and hence the acts and the order were invalid as in
violation of the Federal Constitution.

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.
212 U. S.

Argument for Appellants in No. 396.

Mr. Edward B. Whitney, with whom Mr. George S. Coleman
was on the brief, for appellants Willcox et al: "
A simple allegation that a statute is unconstitutional is no
exception to the rule that equity can only be resorted to when
there is no adequate remedy at law. Cruickshank v. Bidwell,
176 U. S. 73; Indiana Manufacturing Co. v. Koehne, 188 U. S.
681, 684. The suit canfiot be maintained on the ground that
it prevents multiplicity of actions, since no representative consumers were made parties, as in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.
123, .129. See Richman v. ConsolidatedGas Co, 114 N. Y. App.
Div- 216, 224; S.C., 186 N. Y. 409. -A statute should never if
possible be construed so as to be unconstitutional or absurd.
Oates v. National Bank, 100 U. S. 244; Grenada County v.
Brogden, 112 U. S.268. Penalty laws are strictly construed.
France v. United States, 164 U. S.676, 682; Bolles v- Outing
Co., 175 U. S. 262, 265; United States v. One Bay Horse, 128
Fed. Rep. 207. 'The penalty clause in this act was not properly construed by the court below, but as properly construed
is reasonable. Cox v. Paul, 175 N. Y. 328; Griffin v. Interurban Street Railway Co., 179 N. Y. 438, 448-449; S. C., 180,
N. Y. 538; see cases cited in In re Snow, 120 U. 8. 286; United States v. Patty, 2 Fed. Rep. 664; Armour Packing Co. v.
United States, 209 U. S.56, 77; United States v. Eagan, 30 Fed.
Rep. 498; Taft v. Stephens Lithographic Co., 38 Fed. Rep. 28;
Creeps v. Durden, Cowp. 640; Central R. R. Co. v. Green, 86
Pa. St. 427. Assuming equity to have had jurisdiction, it
should have, been declined and the controversy remitted to
the state courts.
The 75-cent rate as to the city is not an unconstitutional
discrimination. On the contrary, since the 75-cent statute
was passed in .1905, and under it the complainant could still
earn nearly ten per cent according to the Circuit Court figures,
it was valid when enacted, and therefore could not be made
invalid by the passage of a subsequent law,. even if the latter
were unconstitutional;

392 (derived from Wellington, Petitioners, 16 Pick. 87, 96-97,
and Talbot v. Hudson, 16 Gray, 417, 422), and the test laid
down in San Diego Land Co. v. Jasper, 189 U. S. 439, 441442, as between two unimpeached and qualified expert witnesses, the valuations most favorable to defendant must be
adopted; a statute cannot be declared unconstitutional upon
testimony of experts or employds (see Chicago & Grand Trunk
Railway Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S.339), unless the State admits its correctness; complainant is entitled to no higher valuations than those which it has itself fixed under oath; and
items incapable of exact valuation must be put down at the
minimum 'amount that a fair minded state court could fix.
At least as to all items of capitalization over and above the
actual cost of the property, the test must be this: Is it logical
or equitable that the consumer should pay more cents per
thousand cubic feet of the gas he burns because of the inclusion of this item?
The period to which attention must be directed is the month
of May, .1906, when the suit was -begun. If conditions thereafter change, the remedy. is under Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.
466, 549-550.
The basis of valuation of the land occupied by complainant's plants should not exceed its cost to the company. Of
two gas companies, long established in the same community,
neither should be permitted to charge a higher rate than the
other to its consumers for the sole reason that, on account
of movements of population uninfluenced by either company,
the site of its plant would be the more valuable if vacated and
sold. The fortunate company is entitled to obtain full value
of the land when sold, but meanwhile the unrealized profit
does not represent profit used in the manufacture and distribution of gas; it represents wealth which the manufacture
and distribution of gas keeps out of use. But if the basis of.
valuation is to exceed the cost of the land it should still not
with other land capaexceed the estimated cost of replacing .it
ble of accomplishing the same result.

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.
212 U. S.

Argument for Appellants in No. 396.

The manufacturing plants should be valued not at what it
would cost to reproduce them as they stand, but at what It
would cost to produce a modern construction which could do
the same amount of work. The complainant is estopped from
disputing in such a case as this the valuation which it has itself
given to the state tax officers and investigating committee.
The complainant is not entitled to any allowance of increased
value over original cost of the pipes in the streets, due to the
fact that the streets have been repaved with money raised by
assessments upon the consumers, complainant being excused
under the state law from paying assessments.
A franchise with; is to be distinguished from a franchise
without, the right to'charge a minimum toll or earn a minimum
dividend. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148
U. S. 312, belongs to the latter class (see original record in
that. case, pp. 33, 39, 50, 53, and brief for appellee therein).
A revocable franchise is not entitled to be valued at a substantial sum. Kingsland v. The Mayor, 110 N. Y. 569, 583.
The franchises claimed by complainant are either unconstitutional, or not complainant's property, or revocable immediately, or upon short notice. Moreover, a franchise to build
and operate, without any special contract guaranteeing a minimum rate, has ho value cognizable in rate-making or condemnation proceedings except that it gives the company the valuable right to have its tangible assets valued as portions of a
profitable going concern, instead of merely as a job lot of
secondhand material. See People ex rel. Metropolitan Street
Railway Co. v. Tax Commissioners, 174 N. Y. 417; Brunswick
Water District v. Maine Water Co., 99 Maine, 371, 375-381.
Such a franchise must be construed as having been granted
subject to the fixing of a reasonable maximum rate. There is
an implied understanding that the tolls shall be high enough.
to give the company a fair return. A fair return on what?
What would counsel advise a proposed purchaser about it,
the day after the company opened for business? According
to our contention it would be calculated upon the capital in-

vested. Moreover, the State can at any time authorize or dire t the city to build its own lighting plant. If this be done,
the company must drop its claim for a profit on its alleged
franchise or lose all its customers. Skaneateles Water Case, 161
N. Y. 154; S.'C., 184 U. S. 354, and the Newburypert Cases,
168 Massachusetts, 541, 555; 103 Fed. Rep. 584; 193 U.S.
561.
The basis of the maximum rate regulation should not be a
figure exceeding the capital actually invested. At the time of
the granting of the franchise the impliediunderstanding is that
a reasonable return will be all6wed upon'the capitalT invested,
in view of the special risk of the enterprise. If assured that
the public will protect him to the extent of allowing him to
make, if successful, a profit upon that investment proportionate to that risk, the investor will take it.
As to the rate of return, it has been. already decided that
six per cent, including an allowance for depreciation, is sufficient. San Diego Co. v. Japer, 189 U. S. 439, 446. But it is
submitted that property is not taken under the Fourteenth
Amendment if the owner is allowed, over and above a proper
contingent fund, a sum sufficient to cover the elements known
in political economy as interest on capital and wages of superintendence; the element of insurance against the special risks
of the business not being protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but one as to which the responsibility is upon' the State.
Mill's Political Economy, Book I, Ch. 15, Â§ 1; J. L. Laughlin's
Elements.of Political Economy, ed. 1902, pp. 202, 206; Marshall's Principles of Economy, Book VI, Ch. 6, Â§Â§ 4, 5.: If
complainant is. entitled to six per cent upon any part bf its'
investment, it is. not so entitled as to the whole of the investment; for companies so situated could borrow in ordinary times
at considerably lower rate to the extent of half the tangible
property, nor is there evidence justifying the return at any
particular rate upon the franchise item.
The bill should be dismissed because the experience of the
other companies doing business in the same territory, as well

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.

Argument for Appellant in No. 397.

as of this complainant, should have been shown. If one of two
companies doing business in the same territory can make a
reasonable profit at the statutory rate, then that rate is constitutional as to both companies, since to apply it to that
company alone would violate its rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment. See Gill Case, 156 U. S.657; Cotting Case, 183
U. S.114. Applying the same rate to the company less well
equipped would not violate its rights, although it might force
reconstruction, temporarily cutting off any return. Moeschen
v. Tenement House Department, 89 N. Y. App. Div. 526, 538;
179 N. Y. 325, 330; 203 U. S.583.
Assuming that an injunction were proper in this case, it
should have been conditioned upon complainant's reducing its

The court below erred in assigning to the franchises acquired by. the appellee under the consolidation agreement a

of $12,000,000 for these franchises that the court decreed the
enactments to be unconstitutional in respect of the rates fixed.
Whatever monetary value might, for any purpose, be assigned
to these franchises, it disappears when the rate of charge for

service is so reduced as to yield no more than a fair and reasonable return on the investment in the means employed in
rendering the service; the court having found $47,831,435
as the value of the tangible assets employed by the appellee,
and six per cent to be a reasonable return, and that the return the appellee would probably realize at the reduced rate
would be $3,024,592.45, which is more than six per cent on
the valuation so found-the court erred in adding to that. valuation $12,000,000 for franchises, thus increasing the investment to $59,831,435, on which the probable return would be
less than six per cent, though the return would even then be.
reasonable.
The court below erred in assigning to the tangible assets any
value in excess of their original cost to the constituent corporations of the appellee and the cost of any additions thereto
since 1884, the time of consolidation. The entire cost of the
real estate employed in its business by the appellee was only
$4,118,267.38 as against $11,985,435 allowed by the decree,
being a difference of $7,867,167.62,. Which, being deducted
from the total valuation of $47,831,435, would reduce that
total to $39,964,268.38, on which the return, of 83,024,592.45
would be-more than seven per cent. Further, if the
valuation for franchises be excluded, whether we take original cost
to constituent corporations, or 'appraised valuation by the
constituent corporations in 1884 for the purposes of consolidation and'additions thereto since then, or even present values as found by the master and approved by the court, the
result is the same; the net return of $3,024,592.45 exceeds
six per centum; when the item franchises, valued by the corporations in 1884 at $7,781,000, and not separately: valued
by the master, but increased by the court, through a process of reasoning, to $12,000,000 is added that even then
the return is over five per centum. And further, $5,555,761.63
.has been unwarrantably added for reproductive cost of mains
and services and deducting this sum and the excessive allowance for real estate from the total found by the court, the

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.

31

Argument for Appellant in No. 398.

return to the appellee on its investment would be more than
eight per cent.
The return of six per cent adopted by the court, is more
than a fair return to the appellee, that is more than is usually
obtained or expected from equally safe investments.
The finding 'of the court as to the impossibility of the appellee fulfilling the requirement as to pressure in its mains is
predicated of the erroneous Valuations of the property of the
appellee, and these being corrected the appellee would be able
to make the requisite changes and still have a fair return; and
the requirement is separable from the other provisions.
The legislation complained of is not unjustly discriminatory;
the discrimination is just and reasonable, the city standing in
the relation of a wholesale consumer or buyer; the cost of supplying the city is greatly less than the cost of supplying other
.consumers; and the difference of five cents per thousand feet
in favor of the city when spread over the entire sales of the
appellee results in a difference of only fifteen one-hundreths of
a cent per thousand feet in favor of the city.
The appellee has an adequate defense at law against proceedings to-enforce performance of any of the provisions of the
statute, if they are not enforcible, and, by injunction, against
the separable provisions for penalties.
Mr. William S. Jackson, Attorney General of the State of
New York, for appellant in No. 398:
The evidence fails to show that it was impossible for the
legislature fair-mindedly to come to the results reached.
The legislative acts were based upon evidence presented by
complainant.
The legislative acts were invalidated by improper methods
of valuation, involing property not entitled to a return, gross
over-valuations and duplications. For purposes of rate regulation, neither franchise nor g 3od-will can be valued' separitely from tangible property. The valuation of franchises
and good-will would nullify the State's power to reduce rates

The maximum rate fixed by chapter 125 of the Laws of 1906,
will permit complainant to earn a fair return upon the property employed by it in its gas business.
A statute which permits a public service corporation to earn
a return of five and five-tenths (5.5) per cent per annum upon
investment in constantly appreciating realty, in plant and
property in the streets protected against depreciation, and
upon intangible property, which is constantly appreciating in
value, does not constitute confiscation of that property.

We submit that all this allowance in excess of 7.70 cents for

Assuming that compliance with the pressure provisions was
at all practicable, it would involve the expenditure of at least
$4,000,000, a substantial increase in operating charges and a
reconstruction of the company's distributing system throughout the city; such compliance was physically impossible before
the act became operative and the penalties for non-compliance
accrued; nor could such increased fixed charges and operating
expenses be incurred under the eighty-cent gas rate, and leave
a fair return.
The penalties for failure to comply would aggregate at $5,000
per day, $1,800,000 per year under complainant's distributing
system as now existing and in operation.
The subjects of price, quality and pressure are so interwoven
in these statutes that the requirements as to pressure cannot be
severed from the other provisions so that the court can reasonably believe that the legislature would have enacted the provisions as to price and candle power with the provision as to
pressure eliminated, and this being so, the whole scheme of
legislation is invalidated. The legislative history of the statutes plainly shows the interdependence of the provisions.
This court is under no obligation to determine for the legislature which of two impossible alternatives is to be eliminated.
Non constat that the legislature-may not prefer to retain the
old maximum price of $1 to enable the complainant to reconstruct its plant; non constat that it may not prefer to repeal the
provisions is to pressure in order that the price of gas may be
reduced.
The cases cited by counsel for appellants upon the question
of severability do not sustain their contentions. Pollock v.

pressure provision is not severable from the body of the statute. See People v. Porter, 90 N. Y. 68; Trustees Saratoga
Springs v. Gas Co., 191 N. Y. 123.
The provisions of said acts as to penalties are uncoititutional on their face and invalidate both statutes. Such penalties operate as a denial of the equal protection of the laws.
Cotting v. Stockyards Co., 183 U. S. 79; Ex parte Young, 209

Both statutes are unduly discriminatory, and therefore unconstitutional upon their face.
This corporation has, as every one has, the liberty of contract
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Lochner v. New
York, 198 U. S.53; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S.589. The
State, therefore, has no general and unlimited right to interfere
between the producer and the consumer as to the price upon
which they would otherwise mutually agree, and while, as to
public utility corporations the supervisory power of the State,
subject to the guarantees of the Constitution, has been recognized since Munn v. Illinois, yet the State, when it seeks to
interfere with the rights of property and the liberty of the citizen to contract for the sale of the products of his labor, only
has power to prevent extortion by maximum charges of general
and uniform application.
Under the police power to regulate rates, the State is without power to direct a public utility corporation to sell to one
customer at a less price than to another. Its power to step
between the public service corporation and its customers is
exhausted when it fixes a general ahd uniform maximum price
for the public service. Lake Shore R. R. Co. v. Smith, 173U. S.

The rate fixing-power is one of prohibition. In strictness, it
does not fix rates, but simply provides that any sum beyond

When, therefore, the State provides that as to all other consumers, 80 cents per thousand feet is a reasonable charge, and
provides that, as to one consumer, no greater charge than 75
cents shall -be made, it in effect declares that to the favored
consumer gas must be sold at less than a reasonable rate.
This the State cannot do.
The finding of the Circuit Court that the rates prescribed
would yield the complainant less than a just and reasonable
rate of return is a finding of fact and not a conclusion of law,
and this court should therefore give to such finding the controlling weight of a special verdict of a jury and not reverse
such finding except for clear and indubitable error. Turnpike

While- the point has not been directly passed upon by this
court, yet, wherever it has been referred to in the general discussion of the subject of rate regulation, it has been stated or

by counsel for the appellants, the Public Service Commission, in
their brief in this court. They assume to criticise that court
for taking jurisdiction of this case, as precipitate, as if it were
a question of discretion or comity, whether or not that court
should have heard the case. On the contrary, there was no
discretion or comity about it. When a Federal court is properly appealed to in a case over which it has by law jurisdiction,
it is its duty to take such jurisdiction (Cohens v. Virginia, 6
Wheat. 264, 404), and in taking it that court cannot be truthfully spoken of as precipitate in its conduct. That the case may
be one of local interest only is entirely immaterial, so long as
the parties are citizens of different States or a question is involved which by law brings the case within the jurisdiction of
a Federal court. The right of a party plaintiff to choose a Federal court where there is a choice cannot be properly denied.
In re Metropolitan Railway Receiverthip, 208 U. S. 90-110;
Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line et al., 211 U. S. 210. In the latter
case it was said that a plaintiff could not be forbidden to try
the facts upon which his right to relief is'based before a court
of his own choice, if otherwise competent. It is true an application for. an injunction was denied- in that case because the
plaintiff should in our opinion have taken the appeal allowed
him by the law of Virginia while the rate of fare in litigation was
still at the legislative stage, so as to make it absolutely certain
that the officials of the State would try to establish and enforce
an unconstitutional rule.
The case before us is not like that. It involves the constitutionality, with reference to the Federal Constitution, of two
acts of the legislature of New York, and it is one Qver which the
Circuit Court undoubtedly had jurisdiction -under the act of
Congress, and. its action in taking and hearing the case cannot
be the subject of proper criticism.
An examination of the record herein, with reference to the
questions involved in the meriis, shows that the act under
which the Gas Commission was appointed was subsequently to
the commencement and trial of this suit, declared, on grounds

Opinion of the Court.

not here mauerial, to be unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals of New York. 191 N. Y. 123, February 18, 1908. The
order made by the commission must therefore be regarded as
invalid. -Itis not important in this case, because the act of
the legislature of 1906, makes the same provision as to the price
of gas to consumers other than the city 'that the order does.
We have as remaining to be considered- the above-mentioned
two acts.of the legislature.
The question arising is as to the validity of the acts limiting
the rates for gas to the prices therein stated. The rule by which
to determine the question is pretty well established in this
court. The rates must be plainly unreasonable to the extent
that their enforcement would be equivalent to the taking of
property for public use without such compensition as under the
circumstances is just both to the owner and the public. There
must be a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. San Diego Land
& Town Company v. National City, 174 U. S. 739, 757; Same
v. Jasper, 189 U. S. 439, 442.
Many of the cases are cited in Knoxville v. Water Co., just decided, ante, p. 1. The case must be a clear one before the courts
ought to be asked to interfere with state legislation upon the
subject of rates, especially before there has been any actual experience of the practical result of such rates. In this case the
rates have not been enforced as yet, because the bill herein-was
filed and an injunction obtained restraining their enforcement
before they came into actual operation.
In order to determine the rate of return upon the reasonable
value of the property at the time it is being used for the public,
it, of course, becomes necessary to ascertain what that value is.
A very great amount of evidence was taken before the master
upon that subject, which is included in five large volumes of
the record. Valuations by expert witnesses were given as to
the value of the real estate owned by the complainant, and as
to the value of the mains, service pipes, plants, meters and
miscellaneous personal property.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

212 U. S.

The value of real estate and plant is to a considerable extent
matter of opinion, and the same may be said of personal estate
when not based upon the actual cost of material and construction. Deterioration of the value of the plant, mains, and pipes
is also to some extent based upon opinion. All these matters
make questions of value somewhat uncertain; while added to
this is an alleged prospective loss of income from a reduced
rate, a matter also of much uncertainty, depending upon the
extent of the reduction and the probable increased consumption, and we have a problem as to the character of a rate which
is difficult to answer without a practical test from actual operation of the rate. Of course, there may be cases where the
rate is so low, upon any reasonable basis of valuation, that
there can be no just doubt as to its confiscatory nature, and in
that event there should be no hesitation in so deciding and in
enjoining its enforcement without waiting for the damage
which must inevitably accompany the operation of the business under the objectionable rate. But where the rate complained of shows iii any event a very narrow line of division
between possible confiscation and proper regulation, as based
upon the value of the property found by the court below, and
the division depends upon opinions as to value, which differ
considerably among the witnesses, and also upon the results in
the future of operating under the rate objected to, so that the
material fact of value is left in much doubt, a court of equity
ought not to interfere by injunction before a fair trial has been
made of continuing the business under that rate. and thus
eliminating, as far as is possible, the doubt arising from opinions as opposed to facts.
A short history of the complainant, as to its incorporation
and its capital, and the method by which the value of its franchises was arrived at, will render the further examination of
the case more intelligible.
Prior to 1884 there were seven gaslight companies in New
York City, each operated under separate charters, granted at
different times between the years 1823 and 1865 or 1871. They

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.
212 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

each had the right to use the streets of certain portions of the
city for the purpose of laying their mains and service pipes in
order to furnish gas to the city and the citizens. Not one of
the companies had ever been called upon to pay a penny for
such right, but the grant to each was in that aspect a gratuity.
It was not, at the time of granting franchises such as these, the
custom to pay for them.
In 1884, by chapter 367 of the laws of that year, authority
to consolidate manufacturing corporations was granted upon
conditions mentioned in the act. The directors of the corporations proposing to consolidate were to make an agreement.
for consolidation, embracing, among other things, the amount
of capital and the number of shares of stock into which it
should be divided, the capital not to be in amount more "than
the fair aggregate value of the property, franchises and rights
of the several companies to be consolidated." The agreement
was not to be valid until submitted to the stockholders of each
of the companies and approved by two-thirds of each. The
constituent companies, which were afterwards consolidated under their agreement, and pursuant to the act mentioned, were
six in number, the seventh, the Mutual Company, withdrawing.
The companies agreed upon the valuation of their property,
which was to be paid for in the stock of the consolidated company, and the original stock held by the stockholders of each
company was surrendered to the consolidated company. The
value, of the franchises of all the companies was set at the
figure of $7,781,000. The court below said that the master reported there was little direct evidence before him as to the
value of the franchises, to which the court added that if the
master, by direct evidence, meant testimony of the same kind
regarding their value as had been offered regarding every item
of tangible property, there was none at all.
The court further stated "that it does not appear in the evidence how the valuation of the franchises was measured, or
why the figures selected were chosen, but that it was true that
when complainant was organized, in 1884, under the consolida-

tion statute, which in terms permitted it to acquire the property and franchises of the other companies, it issued stock of
the par value of $7,781,000, representing the franchises it then
acquired and nothing else, and that the stock was held by purchasers, who, I am compelled to think, had a right to rely upon
legal protection for legally issued stock." It is not, of course,
contended there was special stock issued for this particular item,
but it was included in the total sum for which the consolidated
company issued its stock and upon its receipt the stockholders
in the various companies surrendered their stock in those companies. The result was that the amount of the stock issued by
the consolidated company was increased by $7,781,000, representing a value of franchises which was agreed upon by the
stockholders in the companies, and which had never cost any
of them a single penny.
It cannot be disputed that franchises of this nature are property and cannot be taken or used by others without compensation. Monongahela Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312; People
v. O'Brien, 111 N. Y. 1, and cases cited. The important question is always one of value. Taking their value in this case as
arrived at by agreement of their owners, at the time of the consolidation, that value has been increased by the finding of the
court below to the sum of $12,000,000 at the time of the commencement of this suit. The trial court said: "If, however,
complainant's franchises were worth $7,781,000 in 1884, and
its tangible property, at the same time, was appraised (as appears in evidence), at $30,000,000 $in round figures), then since
complaiaant's business (in sales volume) has, in twenty-three
years, almost quadrupled, and its tangible assets grown to
$47,000,000, it appears to me that a fair method of fixing value
of the franchises in 1905 is to assume the same growth in value
for the franchises as is demonstrated by the evidence in the
case of tangible property. If, therefore, the franchise valuation of 1884 was proportioned to personalty and realty of
$30,000,000, a franchise valuation proportioned to $47,000,000
in 1905 would be over $12,000,000. This, I think, a logical re-

Opinion of the Court.

sult from the -assumption I am compelled to start with, i.e.,
that franchises have a separate and independent value. But
there is, however, no method of valuing franchises, except by
a consideration of earnings; earnings must be proportioned to
assets; and both kinds of assets, tangible and intangible, must
stand upon the same plane of valuation; having, therefore, a
measure of growth of tangible assets from 1884 to 1905, the
franchise assets must be assumed to have grown in the same
proportion. I find that the value of complainant's franchises
at the date of inquiry was not less than $12,000,000, making a
total valuation of $59,000,000, upon which the probable return
is $3,030,000, or very considerably less than .6 per cent." The
judge stated his own views as opposed to including these franchises in the property upon the value of which a return is to
be calculated in fixing the amount of rates, but held that he
was bound by decided cases to hold against his personal views.
We are not prepared. to hold with the court below as to the
increased value which it attributes to the franchises. It is not
only too much a matter of pure speculation, but we think it is
also opposed to the principle upon which such valuation should
be made. This corporation is one of that class which is subject
to regulation by the legislature in the matter of rates, provided
they are not made so low as to be confiscatory. The franchises
granted the various companies and held by, complainant consisted in the right to open the streets of the city and lay down
mains and use them to supply gas, subject to the legislative
right to so regulate the price for the gas as to permit not more
than a fair return (regard being had to the risk of the business)
upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is
being used for the public.
The evidence shows that from their creation, down to the
consolidation, in 1884, these companies had been free from legislative regulation upon the amount of the rates to be charged
for gas. They had been most prosperous and had divided very
large earnings in the shape of dividends to their stockholders,
dividends which are characterized by the Senate committee,

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Op dion of the Court.

212 U. S.

appointed in 1885 to investigate the facts surrounding the consolidation, as enormous. The report of that committee shows
that several of the companies had averaged, from their creation, dividends over sixteen per cent, and the six companies in
the year 1884 paid a dividend upon capital which had been
increased by earnings, as in the case of the Manhattan and the
New York, of eighteen per cent, and, had it been upon the
money actually paid in, it would have been nearly twentyfive per cent.
The committee also said in the same report that these "franchises were in force November 10, 1884, the time of the consolidation, and the money invested in them was earning the
same enormous dividends. So far as the evidence shows, there
was nothing in the condition of affairs on the 10th of November to indicate that these franchises would not be as valuable
for the next twenty years as they had been in the past. There
were gas companies enough in the city with a capacity capable
of supplying the demands for the next twenty years. A law
was on our statute books that virtually prohibited the laying
:of any more gas pipes in the streets. The gas comlianies had
an agreement among themselves, fixing the price of gas at a
figure that paid these dividends. The people were paying this
price, as they had in the past, without objection or protest.
This price may have been too high, and the dividends were
excessive, but they were not illegal, and the valuation of the
franchises computed upon these dividends, and that state of
facts cannot be called a violation of a law that expressly
authorized it to be done, unless such valuation was too
high."'
The committee, upon these facts, were of opinion that the
valuation of $7,781,000 for the franchises was not more than
their fair aggregate value.
Assuming, as the committee did, that the company would
be permitted to charge the same prices in the future which in
the past had resulted in these "enormous or "excessive" dividends, it need not be matter of surprise that a franchise by

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

means of which such dividends had been possible was not regarded as overvalued at the sum stated in 1884.
We think that under the above facts the courts ought to accept the valuation of the franchises fixed and agreed upon under the act of 1884 as conclusive at 'that time. The valuation
was provided for in the act, which was followed by the coinpanies, and the agreement regarding it has been always recognized as valid, and the stock has been largely dealt in for more
than twenty years past 'on the basis of the validity of the valuation and of the stock issued by the company.
But although the State ought, for these reasons, to be bound
to recognize the value agreed upon in 1884 as part of the property upon which a reasonable return can be demanded, We do
not think an increase in that valuation ought to be allowed
upon the theory suggested by the court below. Because the
amount of gas supplied has increased to the extent stated, and
the other and tangible property of the corporations has increased so largely in value, is not, as it seems to us, any reason
for attributing a like proportional increase in the value of the
franchises. Real estate may have increased in value very
largely, as also the personal property, without any necessary
increase in the value of the franchises. Its past value was
founded, upon the opportunity of obtaining these enormous
and excessive returns upon the property of the company, without legislative interference with the price for the supply of gas,
but that immunity for the future was, of course, uncertain, and
the moment it ceased and the legislature reduced the earnings
to a reasonable sum the great value of the franchises would be
at once and unfavorably affected, but how much so it is not
possible for uA now to see. The value would most certainly not
increase. The question of the regulation of rates did from
time to time thereafter arise in the- legislature, and finally
culminated in these acts which were in existence when the
court below found -this increased value of the franchises.
WV cannot, in any view of the case, concur., in that finding.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

212 U. S.

This increase in value did, however, form part of the sum
upon which the court below held the complainant was entitled
to a return. That court found the value of the tangible assets
actually employed at the time of the commencement of this
suit in the business of supplying gas by the complainant to be
$47,831,435, to which it added the $12,000,000 as the value
of the franchises as found by it, making the total of $59,831,435,
upon which it held- that the company was entitled to a return
of 6 per cent, being $3,589,886.10. It also found its total net
income for the year 1905 amounted to $5,881,192.45, almost 10
per cent upon the sum above named. Altering the finding of
the court so far only as to place the value of the franchises at
the time agreed upon in 1884, $7,781,000, the total value upon
that basis of the property employed by the company would be
$55,612,435, upon which 6 per cent would be $3,336,746.10,
while the sum, estiiated as the return on 80 cent gas would
have been $3,024,592.14, which is nearly 5j per cent on the
above total of $55,612,435.
What has been said herein regarding the value of the franchises in this case has been necessarily founded upon its own
peculiar facts, and the decision thereon can form no precedent
in regard to the valuation of franchises generally, where the
facts are not similar to those in the case before us. We simply
accept the sum named as the value under the circumstances
stated.
There is no particular rate of compensation which must in
all cases and in all parts of the country be regarded as sufficient
for capital invested in business enterprises. Such compensation must depend greatly upon circumstances and locality;
among other things, the amount of risk in the business is a
most important factor, as well as the locality where the business
is conducted and the rate expected and usually realized there
upon investments of a somewhat similar nature with regard to
the risk attending them.. There may be other matters which
in some cases might also be properly taken into account in
determining the rate which an investor might properly expect

Opinion of the Court.

or hope to receive and which he would be entitled to without
legislative interference. The less risk, the less right to any
unusual returns upon the investments. One who invests his
money in a business of a somewhat hazardous character is very
properly held to have the right to a larger return without legislative interference, than can be obtained from an investment
in Government bonds or other perfectly safe security. The
man that invested in gas stock in 1823 had a right to look for
and obtain, if possible, a much greater rate upon his investment than he who invested in such property in the city of
New York. years after the risk and danger involved had been
almost, entirely eliminated.
In an investment in a gas company, such as complainant's,
the risk is reduced almost to a minimum. It is a corporation,
which in fact, as the court below remarks, monopolizes the gas
service of the largest city in America, and is secure against
competition 'under the circumstances in which it is placed,
because it is a proposition almost unthinkable that the city of
New York would, for purposes of making competition, permit
the streets of the city to be again torn up in order to allow the
mains of another company to be laid all through them to supply.
gas which the present company can adequately supply. And,
so far as it is given us to look into the future, it seems as certain as anything of such a nature can be, that the demand for
gas will increase, and, at the reduced price, increase to a considerable extent. An interest in such a business is as near a
safe and secure investment as can be imagined with regard to
any private manufacturing business, although it is recognized
at the same time that there is a possible element of risk, even
in such a business. The court below regarded it as the most
favorably situated gas business in America, and added that
all gas business is inherently subject tomany of the vicissitudes
of manufacturing. Under the circumstances, the court held
that a rate which would permit a return of six per cent would
be enough to avoid the charge of confiscation, and for the reason
that a return of such an amount was the return ordinarily

sought and obtained on investments of that degree of safety
in the city of New York.
Taking all facts into consideration, we concur with the court
below on this question, and think complainant is entitled to six
per cent on the fair value Of its property devoted to the public
use. But assuming that the company is entitled to six per cent
upon the value of its property actually used for the public, the
total value fixed by the court below is, as we have seen, much
too large. We must first strike out the increased value of the
franchises asserted by the court over the amount agreed upon
in 1884, when the companies were consolidated. We also find
that the total value of the tangible property is made up of
several items, two of which areReal estate.......... *...................
$11,985,435
Plants .................................
15,000,000
Both depend largely upon the opinions of expert witnesses as
to the value of that kind of property. Where a large amount
of the total value of a mass of different properties consists in
the value of real estate, which is only ascertained by the varying opinions of expert witnesses, and where the opinions of
the plaintiffs' witnesses differ quite radically from those of
the defendants', it is apparent that the total value must necessarily be more or less in doubt. It, in other words, becomes
matter of speculation or conjecture to a great extent. It may
be, as already suggested, that in many cases the rates objected
to might be so low that there could be no reasonable doubt of
their inadequacy upon any fair estimate of the value of the
property. In such event the enforcement of the rates should
be enjoined even in a case where the value of the property depends upon the value to be assigned to real estate by the evidence of experts. But there may be other cases where the
evidence as to the probable result of the rates in controversy
would show they were so nearly adequate that nothing but a
practical test could satisfy the doubt as to their sufficiency.
In, this case a slight reduction. in the estimated value of the
real estate, plants and mains, as given by the witnesses for

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

complainant, would give a six per cent return upon the total.
value of the property as above stated. And again, increased
consumption at the lower rate might result in increased earnings, as the cost of furnishing the gas would not increase in
proportion to the increased amount of gas furnished. The elevated railroads in New York when first built charged
ten cents for each passenger, but when the rate was reduced to
five cents it is common knowledge that their receipts were not
cut in two, but that from increased, patronage the earnings increased from year to year, and soon surpassed the highest sum
ever received upon the ten cent rate.
â€¢Of course, there is always a point below which a rate could
not be reduced and at the same time permit the proper return
on the value of the property-, but it is equally true that a reduction in rates will not always reduce the net earnings, but
on the contrary may increase them. The question of how
much an increased consumption under a less rate will increase
the earnings of complainant, if at all, at a cost not proportioned
to the former cost, can be answered only by a practical test.
In such a case as this, where the other data upon which the
computation of the rate of return must be based, are from the
evidence so uncertain, and where the margin between possible
confiscation and valid regulation is so narrow we cannot say
there is no fair or just doubt about the truth of the allegation
that the rates are insufficient.
The complainant also contends that the State having taxed
it upon'its franchises cannot be heard to deny their existence
or their value as taxed.
The fact that the State has taxed the company upon its
franchises at a greater value than is awarded them here, is not
material. Those taxes, even if founded upon an erroneous
valuation, were properly treated by the company .as part of
its operating expenses, to be paid out of its earnings before
the net amount could be arrived at applicable to dividends,
and if such latter sums were not sufficient to permit the proper
return on the property used by the company for the public,

52

212 U. S.

then the rate would be inadequate. The future assessment of
the value of the franchises, it is presumed, will be much lessened
if it is seen that the .great profits upon which that value was
based are largely reduced by legislative action. In that way
the consumer will be benefited by paying a reduced sum (although indirectly) for taxes.
We are also of opinion that it is not a case for a valuation of
"good will." The master combined the franchise value with
that of good will, and estimated the total value at $20,000,000.
The complainant has a monoply in fact, and a consumer must
take gas from it or go without. He will resort to the "old
stand," because he cannot get gas anywhere else. The court
below excluded that item, and we concur in that action.
And we concur with- the court below in holding that the
value of the property is to be determined as of the time when
the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property, which
legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates,
has increased in value *since it was acquired, the company is
entitled .to the benefit of such increase.. This is, at any rate,
the general rule. We do not say there may not possibly be an
exception to it, where the property may have increased so enormously in value as to render a rate permitting a reasonable return upon such increased value unjust to the public. How such
facts should be treated is not a question now before us, as this
case does not present it. .We refer to fhe matter only for the
purpose of stating that the decision herein does not prevent an
inquiry into the question when, if ever, it should be necessarily
presented.
The matter of the increased cost of the gas, resulting from
the provisions of the acts, as to making the gas equal to 22
candle-power, is also alleged as a reason for inadequacy of
'rate.
It appears that the average candle-power actually produced
in the first six months of the year 1905 was 22, while but 20
candle-power was exacted by law, and for the last six months
of that year, while 22 candle-power was'exacted, the average

WILLCOX v. CONSOLIDATED GAS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

amount was 24.19. This expense was included in the operating expense of that year, which resulted in the net earnings
above mentioned, while the company was complying with the
requirements of the act in this particular.
It is unnecessary, therefore, to further inquire as to the additional expense caused by this requirement.
Again, it has been asserted that the laws areiinconstitutional,
because of the provision as to pressure, and also by reason of
the penalties which a violation of the acts may render a corporation .liable to.
.The acts provide that the pressure of the gas in the service
mains at any distance from the place of manufacture shall not
be less than one inch nor more than two and a half inches.
The evidence shows that to put a pressure such as is demanded by the acts upon the mains and other service pipes in
their present condition would be to run a great risk of explosion, and consequent disaster. Before compliance with this
provision would be safe the mains and other pipes would have
to be strengthened throughout their whole extent, and at an
expenditure of many millions of dollars, from which-no return
could be obtained at the rates provided in the acts. This
would take from the complainant the ability to secure the
return to which it is entitled upon its property, used for supplying gas, and the provision as to the amount of pressure is
therefore void. This particular duty imposed by the acts is,
however, clearly separable from the enactments as to rates,
and we have no doubt that the remainder of the statute would
have been enacted, even with that provision omitted.
The obligation would remain upon the company to have a
,pressure sufficient to insure a light of 22 candle-power, as pro.
vided in the acts.
We are of the same opinion as to the penalties provided for
a violation of the acts. They are not a necessary or inseparable
part of the acts, without which they' would not have been
passed. If these provisions as to penalties have been properly
construed by the court below; they are undoubtedly void,

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

212 U. S.

within the principle decided in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.'123,
*and the cases there cited, because so enormous and overwhelming in their amount..
When the objectionable part of a statute is eliminated, if the
balance is valid and capable of being carried out, and if the
court can conclude it would have been enacted if that portion
which is illegal had been omitted, the remainder of the statute thus treated is good. Reagan v. Trust Co., 154 U. S.362,
395; Berea College v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 211 U. S.45,
54. This is a familiar principle.
Lastly, it is objected that there is an illegal discrimination as
between the city and the consumers individually. We see no
discrimination which is illegal or for which good reasons could
not be given. But neither the city nor the consumers are finding any fault with it, and the only interest of the complainant
in, the question is to find out whether, by the reduced price to
the city, the complainant is upon the whole unable to realize
a return sufficient to comply with what it has the right to de" mand. What we have already said applies to the facts now in
question.
We cannot see from the whole evidence that the price fixed
for gas supplied to the city by the wholesale, so to speak, would
so reduce the profits from the total of the gas supplied as to
thereby render such total profits insufficient as a return upon
the property used by the complainant. So long as the total is
enough to furnish such return it is not important that with relation to some customers the price is not enough. Minneapolis
&c. v. Minnesota, 186 U. S. 257; Atlantic Coast Line v. North
Carolina Commission, 206 U. S. 1.
. Upon a careful consideration of the case before us we are of
opinion that the complainant has failed to sustain the burden
cast upon it of showing beyond any just or fair doubt that the
acts of the legislature of the State 'of New York are in fact confiscatory.
* It may possibly be, however, that a practical experience
of
the effect of the acts by actual operation under them might

prevent the complainant from obtaining a fair return, as already
described, and in that event complainant ought to have the
opportunity of again presenting its case to the court. To that
end we'reverse the decree, with directions to dismiss the bill
