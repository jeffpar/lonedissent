CERTIORARI to a

On the allegations of the bill,
the Butterworth-Judson
Company was insolvent in the bankruptcy sense, to-wit:
the aggregate of all its property was wholly insufficient
to pay its debts. That is admitted as true on the motion
to dismiss, and establishes the fact of insolvency in the
bankruptcy sense required by § 3466, Rev. Stats. United
States v. Oklahoma, 261 U. S. 253.
The "consent receivership" was a "voluntary assignment." What Congress had in mind was to secure a

priority of payment when an insolvent debtor's property
was subject to involuntary seizure under the bankruptcy
laws, or when the debtor voluntarily assigned it to another. The term "voluntary assignment" denotes not
only the instrument by which property is conveyed, but
also the act of transfer; and in these different senses, i. e.,
means and results, it is variously applied in law. Burrill
on Assignments, 6th Ed.'§ 1. There are many cases where
transactions have been held to be general assignments
without the execution of a formal instrument. (n re
Green, 106 Fed. 313; Moody v. Clinton Wire Cloth Co.,
246 Fed. 653; In re Hersey, 171 Fed. 998; In re Salmon &
Salmon, 143 Fed. 395; Gill v. Farmers Bank, 189 Mo.
App. 401.
The Company's action was voluntary, in every possible
sense of the word. No receiver could have been appointed
at the instance of a simple contract creditor. Hollins v.
Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371. All that the
company had to, do, to secure a dismissal of the bill and
prevent the receivership, was to move to dismiss on the
ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law.
Id; American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., 260 U. S.
360. Instead of resisting the effort to transfer all of its
property to receivers for application and distribution to
the claims of creditors, the Company voluntarily waived
its right to object, affirmatively consented to the receivership, and thereby voluntarily enabled the receivers to be
appointed, without which acquiescence no court could or
would have appointed them. The appointment of the
receivers divested the Company from the possession and
control of all its property.
The modern "consent receivership" is the plan by
which bank creditors and a failing corporation usually
co~perate to accomplish the following results, which
could not be accomplished except by such coaperation and
the voluntary consent of the debtor: (1)"Avoidance of

bankruptcy proceedings. (2) Securing the benefit of an
equity receivership under which there can be the broadest and most flexible operation of the business as a going
concern, absolutely free from harassment or annoyance
from creditors seeking to collect their debts. (3) A protective bankruptcy proceeding (frequently).
It is a commonplace of corporate practice that an
equity receivership, combined with a protective bankruptcy, enables a reorganization committee to delay indefinitely non-assenting creditors, to operate the property as a going concern, and to take their own time about
the reorganization. This can only be done, however,
when there is complete agreement between certain creditors and the insolvent debtor. All this goes to show that
the "consent receivership" is a "voluntary assignment"
and also an " act of bankruptcy" which it is attempted to
camouflage, in order to prevent winding up in bankruptcy. The Government is the one creditor who suffers
by this arrangement, as it gets neither (1) its priority for
taxes in the bankruptcy proceedings nor (2) its priority
under § 3466.
Under the original Bankruptcy Act of 1898, a general
assignment -was an "act of bankruptcy," even if the
debtor was solvent. Therefore, if a" consent receivership"
had been held equivalent to a general assignment, such
"consent receivership" would have been an act of bankruptcy, though the debtor were perfectly solvent, but
only temporarily embarrassed; and solvent concerns could
have been thrown into bankruptcy and wound up. Such
a construction of the Bankruptcy Act would have stopped
all "consent receiverships," apd the courts frequently
held that as the Bankruptcy Act was passed for the benefit
of 'debtors, and was in derogation of the common law, it
should be strictly construed and that "consent receiverships" were not equivalent to a general assignment, and
hence not acts of bankruptcy.

UNITED STATES v. BUTTERWORTH CORP.
504

507

Argument for the United States.

On the other hand, the priority statute was based on
public policy, was declaratory of the common law, and was
passed for the benefit of the United States. It should be
liberally construed. United States v. State Bank of North
Carolina,6 Pet. 29. Under § 3466 it is necessary, not only
that there should be a "voluntary assignment," i. e., a
"consent receivership," but there must be also insolvency
in the bankruptcy sense. The courts should give a liberal
construction to the phrase "voluntary assignment," so
as to hold that a "consent receivership" is the equivalent
to a "voluntary assignment." The Circuit Courts of
Appeals of the First, Fifth and Ninth Circuits hold that a
"consent receivership" is the equivalent of a "voluntar3i
assignment;" and the Fifth and Ninth Circuits hold that
it also constitutes an "act of bankruptcy." Davis v.
Pullen, 277 Fed. 650; Davis v. Miller-Link Lumber Co.,
296 Fed. 649; Bramwell v. U. S. F. & G. Co., 299 Fed. 705;
United States v. Oklahoma, 261 U. S. 253; United States
v. Parker, 120 U. S. 89; Equitable Trust Co. v. Conn.
Brass & Mfg. Co., 290 Fed. 712; Davis v. Michigan Trust
Co., 2 Fed. (2d) 194.
The "consent receivership" was an "act of bankruptcy" committed by the Company, and hence Rev.
Stats. § 3466 became operative and the Government was
entitled to a priority of payment. As there was no national bankruptcy act in existence during the years 17901799, the repeated use of the phrase "act of bankruptcy"
or "act of legal bankruptcy" in these priority statutes,
referred, not to acts of bankruptcy under the English law
(Conard v. Nicoll, 4 Pet. 291; 1 Kent Com. 343, note 1,)
but to acts of bankruptcy under the then existing state
statutes, or under any future bankruptcy laws that might
be passed by Congress. Davis v. Michigan Trust Co.,
2 Fed. (2d) 194. Under the' original Bankruptcy Act of
1898, there was no provision by which the appointment
of a receiver for a debtor could be considered an "act

508

Argument for the United States.

269 U. S.

of bankruptcy." To remedy that situation, Congress
amended the Bankruptcy Act in 1903 (32 Stat. 797) by
adding to § 3a (4) a provision defining it as an act of
bankruptcy where a person," being insolvent, applied for
a Receiver or Trustee for his property, or because of insolvency, a Receiver or Trustee has been put in charge of
his property under the laws of a State, of a territory, or
of the United States."
The operation of § 3466 is certainly defeated, if a
debtor, insolvent in the bankruptcy sense, can, by agreement with a creditor, have the creditor file a suit for a
receiver, with an allegation of a lesser kind of insolvency,
obtain the appointment of a receiver by consent and then
successfully claim that no act of bankruptcy has been
committed-when the only reason for the receivership
was that the debtor was actually insolvent in the bankruptcy sense. The question presented is whether the
Glovernment's priority under § 3466 can be defeated by
an agreement, between a creditor and a debtor, to call the
debtor's financial condition one thing when the receiver
is appointed, whereas, in point of fact, the debtor's condition is something very different; and if that different
condition had'been truthfully alleged, it would have been
an act of bankruptcy and § 3466 would have come into
play. The later authorities hold that if a receiver is appointed upon the ground that the debtor is simply unable
to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, when
it later develops that the debtor was in fact then insolvent
in the bankruptcy sense, such appointment constitutes
an "act of bankruptcy." Hilb v. Am. Smelting & Refining Co., 235 Fed. 384; Re Sedalia Farmers Produce Co.,
268 Fed. 898; Davis v. Michigan Trust Co., 2 Fed. (2d)
194. The theory of those cases is that if it subsequently
develops that, at the time of the application for a receiver,
the debtor was insolvent in the bankruptcy sense, then it
was insolvency, whether recognized at the time* or not,

UNITED STATES v. BUTTERWORTH CORP.

which brought about the receivership. The Bankruptcy
Act provides that an "act of bankruptcy" by any person
shall consist of his having, "being insolvent, applied for
a receiver or trustee for his property." Although the
Company did not, in one sense, apply for a receiver, yet,
in substance, that is exactly what it did. The Court
would never have appointed the receivers, if the debtor
had objected on the ground that the creditor had an adequate remedy at law. It was only by their affirmative
co-operation that the court appointed a receiver.

Henr'y Root Stern and Bertram F. Shipman were on the

in favor of debts due to the United States under § 3466

Under the provisions of § 3466 Rev. Stats. debts due
the United States are not entitled to priority in consent

Mr. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

April 22, 1922, respondent, a New York corporation,
was insolvent within the meaning of R. S. § 3466, and as
defined by the Bankruptcy Act. Its debts amounted to
approximately $3,000,000, and included $1,154,450 due to
the United States. The value of its assets was not in excess of $1,500,000. On that day, the Hay Foundry and
Iron Works, a simple contract creditor, on behalf of itself
and other creditors, brought suit against the respndent
in the District Court for the Southern Distriot of New
York. Among the facts alleged are these: Respondent

owed plaintiff $7,988.43 for labor and materials furnished,
and was without money to pay its debts then due. The
value of its property, if properly and prudently realized
on, would be more than enough to pay its obligations.
Some of its creditors were threatening to bring suits on
their claims; and resulting forced sales of the property
would cause great loss to the creditors. Plaintiff believed
that the property could be preserved for equitable distribution among those entitled thereto only upon the granting of equitable relief including the appointment of receivers, and that, unless the court would deal with the
property as a trust fund for the payment of creditors, it
would be sacrificed to the great loss of creditors. More
would be realized from a sale if the business was being
casried on. The prayer was for the appointment of re-.
ceivers, and that when found to be just and proper the
properties be sold and the proceeds distributed among
those entitled thereto. By its answer filed on the same
day, respondent admitted all the allegations of the complaint, and, with its consent, the court thereupon made an
crder appointing receivers. The order recited that it was
necessary -for the protection of the respective rights and
equities of creditors that the property and business be
administered through receivers, and gave to them the exclusive possession, custody and control; they were authorized to continue the business until the further order of
the court, to make disbursements necessary to preserve
the property, and to pay debts entitled to priority.
September 1, 1922, the United States filed proof of
the debt due from respondent and claimed priority under
§ 3466, and later filed its intervening petition, setting
forth the facts above stated, and prayed to be adjudged
entitled to priority. Respondent moved to dismiss. The
District Court granted the motion. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is here
on certiorari under § 240, Judicial Code.

UNITED STATES v. BUTTERWORTH CORP.

Opinion of the Court.

The question is whether .§ 3466 applies. That section
and § 3467, in pari materia, are quoted in Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & GuarantyCompany, ante,
p. 483. The intervening petition shows that respondent
was insolvent when the creditor's suit was begun, and the
question of priority is to be determined on that basis, notwithstanding the complaint alleged and the answer admitted that respondent was solvent. Respondent's answer
admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent
to the court's order constituted a necessary step in the
proceedings for the appointment of receivers. Re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, 208 U. S. 90, 109, 110;
Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261 U. S. 491, 500. So,
with the consent and coperation of the insolvent debtor,
the possession and control of all its property were handed
over to be administered by the court through the receivers
for the benefit of those whom the court found entitled
to it. Porterv. Sabin, 149 U. S. 473, 479. To induce the
action taken by the court, the complaint represented that,
if respondent's property was not dealt with as a trust
fund for the payment of creditors, they would suffer great
loss. It is established that, when a court of equity takes
into its possession the assets of an insolvent corporation,
it will administer them on the theory that in equity they
belong to the creditors and shareholders rather than to
the corporation itself. See Hollins v. Brierfield Coal &
Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371, 383; Graham v. Railroad Company, 102 U. S. 148, 161. Here, the fund being less than
the debts, the creditors are entitled to have all of it distributed among them according to their rights and
priorities.
Taken in connection with its insolvency, now conceded,
respondent's answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent to the decree appointing receivers
amounted to the handing over of all its property and busi-

ness to the receivers to be administered, under the direction of the court, as a trust fund to pay respondent's debts.
In substance, the things done by respondent amounted to
a voluntary assignment of all its property within the
meaning of § 3466. The United States is entitled to
priority. 'Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, supra, affirming 299 Fed. 705; Davis v.
