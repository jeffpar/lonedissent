Solicitor General Mitchell, with whom Messrs. Robert
P. Reeder and Frederick W. Dewart, Special Assistants to
the Attorney General, and A. W. Gregg, Solicitor of
Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for the Uuited
States.
The proper method of approaching the question is to
ascertain the nature of the wife's interest in community
income in California, by finding what rights of ownership
she may exercise over it under California law. The decisions of the California courts as to the extent of the
wife's interest in the community income and her want of
power to exercise proprietary rights over it are binding
on the federal courts. A general review of the decisions
of the California courts discloses that under the so-called
community system applicable to the community property
here involved, the wife during the. existence of the community had no estate, title, or ownership in the community income, and the husband had absolute ownership and
power of disposition of the income, restricted only by a
prohibition against gifts. Panaud v. Jones, 1 Cal. 488;
Chance v. Kobsted, 226 Pac. 632; Van Marvn v. Johnson,

Disregarding descriptive phrases and terminology,
the California statutes and decisions applicable to the
property here involved have never yielded to the wife
any semblance of a proprietary interest or ownership in
the community property prior to dissolution of the community. The husband has complete and absolute dominidn, possession, and control of the community prop-

income as he pleases, wastefully and for his own pleasure,
without infringing the wife's rights. Spreckels v. Spreckels, 116 Cal. 339; Garrozi v. Dastas, 204 U. S. 64. The
only restrictions on the exercise of absolute ownership by
the husband are a prohibition against gifts without the
wife's consent (which has been held to vest no interest in
her) and a prohibition (enacted in 1917 and not applicable to the property involved here) requiring the wife to
join in a conveyance of community real estate. Roberts
v. Wehmeyer, supra; Spreckels v. Spreckels, 172 Cal. 775.
During the community the wife has no right to expend
or have expended for her benefit any part of the community property. The obligation of the husband to provide support and necessaries is a personal one arising out
of the marital relation, h'aving no relation to the community property, and is a charge upon him and his separate
as well as the community estate, and not based on the
theory that the wife owns an interest in the community.

On dissolution of the community by her death her
inchoate interest disappears. Absolute ownership remains in the husband. She leaves no estate in the community subject to administration, nor is it liable for her
debts or expenses of administration, nor does the husband
take by succession or descent. California Civil Code,
§ 1401; In re Rowland, 74 Cal. 523; In re Burdick, 112
Cal. 387. If she survives her husband, the wife succeeds
to one-half of whatever may then remain of the community property, subject to payment of his debts, and expenses of administration. The entire community property forms part of his estate and is administered as such.
The wife takes as heir, and her succession is subject to
imposition of inheritance taxes. The Act of 1917, relieving the interest of the surviving wife from inheritance
tax is merely an exemption and does not alter the nature
or extent of the wife's interest. In.re Moffitt's Estate,
153 Cal. 359; Civil Code § 1402; In re Burdick, 112 Cal.
387; Sharp v. Loupe, 120 Cal. 89; Cunha v. Hughes, 122
Cal. 111; Moffitt v. Kelly, 218 U. S. 400.
The statutory restriction on gifts by the husband has
been held to vest no interest or ownership in the wife, and
no case has yet held that she may, before dissolution of
the community, sue to set aside a gift made without her
consent. Spreckels v. Spreckels, 172 Cal. 775; Dargie v.
Patterson, 176 Cal. 714; Winchester v. Winchester, 175

Cummings, 2 Cal. Unrep. 774.
On dissolution of the community by divorce, the community property is distributed by the divorce court, and
in the absence of adultery or cruel treatment is divided
equally. If such misconduct has occurred, the court distributes the community property according to what appears to be just and proper. Gould v. Gould, 63 Cal.
App. 172; Taylor v. Taylor, 192 Cal. 71,

Argument for the -United States.

The community property is not liable for debts of the
wife contracted after marriage. It is liable for her debts
contracted dum sola, not because of her ownership in the
community property, but because her husband became
liable for her debts on marriage, and only his separate
estate is exempted by statute. The freedom of the community property from liability for the wife's debts would
prevent the United States from satisfying -a claim against
the wife for income taxes out of the community property.
The United States could not lawfully compel the wife to
pay an income tax on any share of the community income
because it is not hers, but is the income and property of
her husband. Van. Maren v. Johnson, 15 Cal. 308; Civil
Code, § 167; Schuyler v. Broughton, 70 Cal. 282;
Svetinich v. Sheean, 124 Cal. 216.
The case of Blum v. Wardell, 270 Fed. 309 and 276
Fed. 226, may be distinguished, because it dealt with the
nature of the wife's interest in the community property
after dissolution of the community and not with her
interest in the income during the community. If not
distinguished, it should be disapproved, because it misconceived the nature of the Act of 1917, exempting the
wife's succession from state inheritance tax, and treated
it as changing the wife's interest, although it merely
exempted it. It also mistakenly applied the Act of 1917,
requiring the wife to join in a conveyance of real estate,
to property acquired prior to 1917.
The amendments to the California laws affecting the
wife's interest in the community property adopted in
1917 and later are not pertinent here, because all the
property here involved was acquired prior to 1917, and
under California decisions these amendments do not
affect property acquired before their passage. Roberts v.
Wehm yer, 191 Cal. 601; Spreckels v. Spreckels, 116 Cal.

484, Garrozi v. Dastas,204 U. S. 64, and Arnett v. Reade,
220 U. S. 311, do not deal with the California system and
the California court has held that Arnett v.Reade does
not describe the community system prevailing there.
Opinions of text writers, including law writers from California law schools, completely refute the claim that in
California the wife has any ownership in the community
property and the claim that the system in California is
like that in all the other States where a system of "community" property prevails. McKay, Community Property; Pomeroy, in West Coast Rep. Vol. 4, p. 390; "California Jurisprudence," Vol. 5, p. 330, (McMurray); 35
Harvard L. Rev. p. 48, (Evans.)
A comparison of the nature and extent of the wife's
interest in the community property in California with
the nature and extent of the wife's interest in the separate
property and income of the husband in States where the
community system does not prevail, shows that in California she is no more the owner of half the community
income than is the wife an owner ina share of the separate property and income of.the husband in States having a statutory substitute for common law dower. McKay, Community Property; Griswold v. McGee, 102

States, it may be said that to permit the wife in California to reduce the surtaxes on what is really her husband's income by returning half of the community income
as her own would be the most direct discrimination
against husbands and wives in some forty States of the
Union, where, in order to split their incomes between
husband and wife to avoid high surtaxes, husbands must
convey part of their property outright to their wives,
paying a gift tax in the process.

Argument for Defendants in Error.

The policy of the legislation of California has been
consistent from the beginning, to establish the wife's
vested interest on a parity with the like interest of the
husband, and to hedge it round with one safeguard after
another. The decisions of the courts have not been
without conflict. The vested interest of the wife, in far
the great number of decisions, from Beard v. Knox, 5
Cal. 252, (1855,) to the last expression of the Supreme
Court of the State, in Estate of Jolly, 238 Pac. 353, has
been sustained upon the firm grouna that she was a
co-partner and equal owner with her husband in the
community estate, and that, upon his death, she took
her half of the dissolved community, not as the heir
of a husband who was exclusive owner, but in her own
right, as survivor of the matrimonial partnership.
There are conflicting cases,-in point of number a minority; and'in point of authority, largely dicta; with perhaps a single exception, all dicta. These are the dicta
which apply to the wife's interest the attenuating similitude of an " expectancy "-the expectancy of an heir apparent in the property of his ancestor. The remark fell
prixfiarily from Mr. Justice Field, obiter, in Van Maren v.
Johnson, 15 Cal. 308, written in 1860. In his decisions,
before and after, Mr. Justice Field upheld the vested and
equal interest of the wife.

thing may be deemed settled by the Supreme Court of
California, in the law of community property, it is to be
found in its latest decision as in its first, separated by an
interval of seventy, years,-that the community system
rests dominatingly and basically on a matrimonial partnership, t6 the assets of which the wife conclusively contributes on an equality with her husband, and in which,
from the moment of the marriage, she has a "present,
defined, certain interest," as co-owner and co-partner.
The voluntary partnership, so familiar in everyday life,
pays income tax on the just principle that taxation is
correlated with ownership. One partner pays the tax on
the share of the income which belongs to him, not on the
share which belongs to his co-partner. If it be said that
the husband, the managing partner, pays the tax of his
co-partner out of community funds, the discrimination is
not redressed. The tax upon partnership income is not
computed upon the aggregated revenue, with reference to
the higher surtax bracket, and the larger exaction; it is
computed, for each partner, upon his share. It would be
so computed in the case of a brother and sister, succeeding
to the undivided ownership of an income-bearing property; it is so computed by the Treasury, it has been so
computed by the Treasury for a period of years, in respect
to seven out of eight community-property States. (Solicitor's Opinion, 121; T. B. 31-21-1845). Congress, in two
general revisions of the Revenue Law, refused to alter the
method of computation; once, at large, as to the community-property States, as well one as the other; again,
in the specific case of California. But the discriminatiorn
against California still persists, though the highest law
officer of the Government has advised to the contrary.

Robbins was married and the income taxed came frqm
community property in California., acquired before 1917,
when some changes were made in the law, and from the
earnings of Mr. Robbins. He was required by the Treasury Department to return and pay the tax upon the
whole income, against the effort of Mr. and Mrs. Robbins
to file returns each of one-half. The result was that he
had to pay the amount sued for, above what would have
had to be paid if his contention had been allowed. The
District Court found the facts as agreed by the parties
and upon them ruled that the plaintiffs, the executors of
Robbins, were entitled to recover as matter of law. 5

Stat. 936, went into effect. Greenport Basin & Construction Company v. United States, 260 U. S. 512, 514.
Elaborate argument was devoted to the question
whether the interest of a wife in community property has
the relatively substantial character in California that it
has in some other States. That she has vested rights has
been determined by this Court with reference to some
jurisdictions, Warburton v. White, 176 U. S. 484; Arnett
v. Reade, 220 U. S. 311; and the Treasury Department
has carried those rights to the point of allowing a division
in the return of community income in other States where
the community system prevails. Regulations 65 relating
to the Income Tax under the Revenue Act of 1924, Art.
31. Its adoption of a' different rule for California was
based, we presume, upon the notion that in that State a
wife had a mere expectancy while the husband was alive.
If on the whole this notion seems to us to be adopted
by the California courts it is our duty to follow it, so far
as material, even if contrary expressions should be found
here or there in the books; and it is no concern of ours
whether the prevailing decision is a legitimate descendant
from its parent the Spanish law or otherwise.-We can see
no sufficient reason to dotbt that the settled opinion of

UNITED STATES v: ROBBINS.
315

Opinion of the Court.

the Supreme Court of California, at least with reference to
the time before the later statutes, is that the wife had a
mere expectancy while living with her husband. The
latest decision that we have seen dealing directly with the
matter explicitly takes that view, says that it is a rule
of property that has been settled for more than sixty
years, and shovs that Arnett v. Reade, 220 U. S. 311,
would not be followed in that State. Roberts v. Wehmeyer, 191 Cal. 601, 611, 614. In so doing it accords
with the intimations of earlier cases, and does no more
than embody the commonly prevailing understanding
with regard to California law as shown by commentators
and the action of the Treasury Department, as well as by
the declarations of the Court. McKay, Community

But the question before us is with regard to the power
and intent of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,
Title II, Part II, §§ 210, 211; 40 Stat. 1057, 1062. Even
if we are wrong as to the law of California and assume
that the wife had an interest in the community income
that Congress could tax if so minded, it does not follow
that Congress could not tax the husband for the whole.
Although restricted in the matter of gifts, &c., he alone
has the disposition of the fund. He may spend it substantially as he chooses, and if he wastes it in debauchery
the wife has no redress. See Garrozi v. Dastas, 204 U. S.
64. His liability for his wife's support comes from a
different source and exists whether there is community
property or not. That he may be taxed for such a fund
seems to us to need no argument. The same and further
considerations lead to the conclusion that it was intended
to tax him for the whole. For not only should he who
has all the power bear the burden, and not only is the

husband the most obvious target for the shaft, but the
fund taxed, while liable to be taken for his debts, is not
liable to be taken for the wife's, Civil Code, § 167, so that
the remedy for her failure to pay might be hard to find.
The reasons for holding him are at least as strong as those
for holding trustees in the cases where they are liable
under the law. § 219. See Regulations 65, Art. 341.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND dissents.

NEW JERSEY v. SARGENT, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
No. 20, Original.

ET AL.

Submitted October 5, 1925.-Decided. January 4,
1926.

1. A bill by a State for an injunction against federal officers charged
with the administration of a federal statute can not be entertained
by this Court, where the bill does not show that any right of the
State which in itself is an appropriate subject of judicial cognizance, is being, or is about to be, affected prejudicially by the application or enforcement of the Act, but seeks merely to obtain a
judicial declaration that, in certain features, the Act exceeds the
authority of Congress and encroaches upon that of the State.
P. 330.
2. The bill in this case, which seeks to draw in question the constitutionality of parts of the Federal Water Power Act in their relation to waters within or bordering on the complaining State, fails
to present any case or controversy appropriate for exertion of the
judicial power. P. 334.
3. The power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce includes the power to control, for the purposes of such commerce, all navigable waters accessible to it and within the United
States, and to that end to adopt all appropriate measures to free
such waters from obstructions to navigation and to preserve, and
even enlarge, their navigable capacity; and the authority and rights
of a State in respect of such waters within its limits are subordinate
to this power of Congress. P. 337.
Bill dismissed.
