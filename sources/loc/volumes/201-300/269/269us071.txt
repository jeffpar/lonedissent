Nos. 80 and 81. Argued October 22, 23, 1925.-Decided November

16, 1925.
1. In an action under the Trading with the Enemy Act to recover on
the debt of a German to an American citizen, which was due and
payable here in German marks before this country entered the late
war, the damages are to be measured by the value of marks in
dollars as of the time when default occurred. P. 80.
2. The liability to damages having become absolute before the war
began, interest should include the time covered by the war. P. 81.

The district court in calculating the amount of the
German firm's indebtedness in United States money
should have adopted the rate of exchange existing at the
date of the entry of the final decree. This question arises
principally because a court in the United States can not

The following cases either directly or inferentially hold
that the proper rate of exchange to be adopted is the
rate existing at the date of judgment. They seem to represent the weight of authority in the American courts
upon the subject prior to the Great War. Taan v. LeGaux

There were American cases, however, decided prior to
the war which seem to take a contrary view. Amongst
these are: Spreckles v. The Weatherly (1891), 48 Fed.

The text writers, in so far as they adopt any rule,
adopt the rule that the proper rate of exchange is the
rate existing at the date of the trial or at the date of the
actual payment of the money. Sutherland on Damages,

Adol., 78; Delegal v. Naylor (1831), 7 Bing. 460; Cash v.
Kennin (1805), 11 Vesey 314. Coming down to more
recent decisions, the last English case upon the subject
prior to the very recent cases, was Manners v. Pearson
(1898), 1 Ch.Div. 581, which in its proper interpretation,
clearly lays down the rule that the rate of exchange
prevalent at the date of judgment is to be adopted under
circumstances such as the present.
The recent American decisions are not in accord upon
this question, some favoring the date of breach, others
the date of judgment. In the latter cases, the decisions
result mostly from following S. S. Celia v. S. S. Volturno,
(1921), L. R. 2 App. Cas. 544, which was a case sounding in tort. See The Hurona, 268 Fed. 910; The Verdi,

The English courts, since the outbreak of the Great
War, have finally adopted the rule that the rate of exchange existing at the date of the breach of the contract
to pay or the commission of the tort, is the proper rate
to be used in computing in the money of the forum the
amount of a debt or tort in foreign currency. Kirsch &

The following American cases, besides the ones already
cited, adopt the breach date rule: Simonoff v. Bank (1917),
279 II. 248; Rasst v. Morris (1919), 135 Md. 243;
Katcher v. American Express Co. (1920), 94 N. J. Law
165; Wormser v. Marroquin, 249 Fed. 428; Dante v.
Miniggio (1924), 298 Fed. 845; Wichita Mill & Elevator
Co. v. Naamlooze, etc., 3 Fed. (2d) 931. The nearest approach to a consideration of the question by this Court is
found in Birge-ForbesCo. v. Heye, 251 U. S. 317.
It will, of course, be apparent from an examination of
the cases cited above, which have been decided since the
outbreak of the Great War, that the decided weight of
authority is in favor of the rule that the rate of exchange
existing at the date of the breach of the contract is the
proper one. On the other hand, it would seem, in so far
as the cases prior to the war are'helpful, that the rule
prior to that time was that the rate of exchange prevalent
at the date of judgment is the correct one. And it is
interesting to note that some of the old cases which adopt
the latter rule gave the same reason for adopting it as
do many of the modern cases for adopting the former,
namely, that the plaintiff should not be penalized for the
failure of the defendant to pay his obligation, the situation being in the qlder cases that it was more advantageous to the plaintiff to have the rate existing at the time
of the breach of obligation used. There must be a correct rule based upon reasoning which will be applicable
under all circumstances. In a suit to recover the amount
of an obligation owing in marks or any other foreign
currency, the plaintiff is not suing to recover loss he has
incurred by reason of the failure of the defendant to deliver a commodity, and it is perfectly apparent that the
general rule of damages will not apply, for the very reason
that there is no contract price of the marks to be delivered. Hence, the difference between the contract price
of the so-called commodity and the market price can not

HICKS v. GUINNESS.
71

Argument for Respondents.

be found. As a matter of fact the parties did not make
their contract with a view to treating the currency dealt
with in the contract as a commodity. The parties intended the foreign currency to be treated as money.
Gluck, "The Rate of Exchange in the Law of Damages,"
22 Columbia L. Rev., p. 217. There may be much reason
in a suit to recover damages for tort injuries where the
amount of the damages is expressed in foreign currency,
to adopt the rate of exchange existing at the date of the
commission of the tort, as the proper rate, since in such
instances the court is endeavoring to secure the payment
to the plaintiff of compensation for the injuries done.
In the case of a breach of contract to pay money the
situation is somewhat different. While it may be true
that in the case of a breach of contract to, pay money a
new right, namely, the right of damages, is created by
the breach, and it is not a question of enforcing the payment provided for in the contract, it is also quite true
that, while there may be a right of action for damages
under such circumstances, the damages to be recovered
are merely nominal. I Chitty on Pleading, (16th ed.),
p. 121.
The only recompense which the law recognizes for
failure to pay the amount of a debt is the payment of
interest. When the parties made their contract they contracted with respect to a specific currency. The mere
fact that a court in the United States, for reasons of
policy, can not give judgment in marks should not affect
the fundamental nature of the obligation. The obligation of the defendant is to pay marks; and although he
may have committed a breach of contract for failure to
pay the marks on the date'tliey were due, the right of
action which accrued is in its nature a right of action to
recover damages expressed in marks, and while there may
be damages for failure to pay, these damages, as Chitty
remarks, are merely nominal. The right of action to

76

269 U. S.

recover marks continues on down to the very time that
the judgment is to be entered. The court in the trial
of the action must find first how many marks are due
as a result of the breach. The court, in the very nature
of things, must consider the action as an action to recover
marks, and it is impossible to arrive at a result without
taking into consideration the number of marks that are
due. When the court proceeds to enter judgment it
should then consider the subject as if the defendant were
about to pay his obligation, which payment would be
made in marks, and the valub of those marks as of that
moment in American money is the amount the plaintiffs
should recover in American money.
For comments upon the subject see notes in the following publications: 29 Harv. L. Rev. 873; 34 Id. 422
and 435; 20 Columbia L. Rev. 914 and 922; 31 Yale L.
Jour. 198; 19 Michigan L. Rev., 652; 68 Pennsylvania
L. Rev. (59 American Law Register), 395; 37 Law Quarterly Rev. 38.
The plaintiffs are not entitled to recover interest upon
their debt for the period between April 6, 1917, and July
14, 1919. The common law is that interest upon such
obligations is suspended during the period of war, because it is then impossible for the debtor legally to discharge his obligation. Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall. 177;
Hoare v. Allen, 2 Dallas, 102; Jackson Ins. Co. v. Stewart,
1 Hughes, 310; Mayer v. Reed, 37 Ga. 482; Roberts,
Adm., v. Cocks, 28 Gratt. 207; Biglar v. Waller, Chase,
316.
The only provision in the Trading with the Enemy Act
which permits the discharge of a debt owing by an enemy
to a citizen of the United States is the provision of ยง 9,
permitting the filing of a claim by the creditor and the
collection of the obligation out of property of the eneny
seized by the Alien Property Custodian. Unless the com-,
mon-law rule is adhered to in all cases, to permit interest

HICKS v. GUINNESS.
71

Argument for Carl Joerger.

to run during the period of the war on debts which are
collected pursuant to ยง 9 of the Trading with the Enemy
Act would be to adopt one rule as to interest where a
particular German debtor had property in the United
States, which had been seized, and to adopt another rule
in those cases where a German debtor had no property
in the United States which was subject to seizure. Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S. 243; New York Life Ins. Co. v.
Davis, 95 U. S. 425, distinguished. In the present case
there is no evidence, and it is apparently not a fact, that
the enemy debtor had any agent in this country.
The treaty of peace between the United States and Germany, signed on August 25, 1921, has no application to
the questions involved in this case.
Mr. Thomas G. Haight, with whom Mr. Amos J. Peaslee was on the brief, for respondents, Carl Joerger et al.
The rate of exchange prevailing when judgment is entered should be used in converting foreign currency indebtedness into.currency of the country of the forum. In
addition to authorities cited by the Government on this
head, see Metcalf v. Mayer, App. Div. N. Y., October 2,
1925.
Interest should not be allowed for the period while this
nation and Germany were at war. The provisions of the
treaty of Versailles which were made a part of the treaty
between the United States and Germany do not affect the
rate of exchange to be used or interest to be allowed in
suits under ยง 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act.
There is nothing in the Trading with the Enemy Act
itself which requires the universal application of any
particular rate of exchange to all suits brought under it.
If it is necessary to consider the provisions of the treaty
of Versailles, then it is apparent from the history and
language of the Trading with the Enemy Act and the
treaties that creditors, in suits under ยง 9 of the Trading
with the Enemy Act, are entitled to enforce only their

78

common law contractual rights, and that ยง 9 was never
intended to give to a few American creditors the right
to enforce an extra-contractual claim, which is in essence
a claim against the German Government, for losses resulting from the unusual depreciation of the German
mark.
By the reservations in the Congressional resolution and
the treaty of Berlin which incorporated certain provisions
of the treaty of Versailles, American nationals were protected in their claims against the German government
for losses from depreciation of the German mark, and
they can enforce and collect them through the Mixed
Claims Commission under the general award which has
already been made by that Commission. The plaintiffs'
claim for exactly this same debt has been filed with the
Commission and no possible injustice can result from an
interpretation, of the Trading with the'Enemy Act in
the way in which it was obviously intended to operate.
Congress may, if it so elects, utilize the sequestered
German property, after the contractual common law
claims of their creditors have been satisfied out of it, as
well as all other German sequestered property, for the
payment of all claims of all American creditors. and all
other claimants; but up to the present time Congress has
not yet determined whether it will apply the sequestered
property for this purpose or whether it will arrange to
satisfy these claims by some other means. On the contrary, Congress has expressly declared that the sequestered property shall stand as security for all American
claimants. The claimants in the case at bar have no right
to preferential treatment respecting the portion of their
claim which is, in essence, a claim against the government
of Germany.

MR. JuSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These are cross petitions based upon a suit brought
against the Alien Property Custodian by Guinness and
others, doing business under the firm name of Ladenburg,
Thalmann & Co., in New York. The facts are not in
dispute. A German firm, Joerger and others doing business under the nme of Delbriick, Schickler & Co., was
indebted to the American firm under an account stated on
December 31, 1916, for 1079.35 marks, subject to a setoff
of $35.35. The debt was not paid when the war between
Germany and the United States began, April 6, 1917.
The Alien Property Custodian had taken property of the
German firm of a value greater than the debt and the
American firm brought this suit in equity to recover what
was due to it, as provided by the Trading with the
Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106, ยง 9; 40 Stat. 411,
419, amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 241; 41 Stat.
977. The only questions raised and argued here are
whether interest is to be allowed for the time covered by
the war, from April 6, 1917, to July 14, 1919, and at what
date the value of the mark is to be estimated in dollars
in order to fix the amount of the decree. The District
Court held that interest was suspended during the war,
291 Fed. Rep. 768, and that the value of the mark at the
time when the debt should have been paid was the proper
measure. (This value is fixed as 171/ cents.) 291 Fed.
Rep. 769. The decree was affirmed by the, Circuit Court
of Appeals. 299 Fed. Rep. 538. The Alien Property
Custodian in the interest of the German debtors seeks to
reverse the latter ruling, in No. 80, and the American
firm seeks to reverse the former ruling, in No. 81.

80

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

269 U. S.

We take up the second question first as the principles
that govern it have some bearing upon the matter of interest also. We are of opinion that the Courts below were
right in holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover
the value in dollars that the mark had when the account
was stated. The debt was due to an American creditor
and was to be paid in the United States. When the contract was broken by a failure to pay, the American firm
had a claim here, not for the debt, but, at its.option, for
damages in dollars. It no longer could be compelled to
accept marks. It had a right to say to the debtors "You
are too late to perform what you have promised, and we
want the dollars to which we have a right by the law here
in force. Gould v. Banks, 8 Wend. 562, 567. The event
has come to'pass upon which your liability becomes absolute as fixed by law." Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., 190 U. S. 540, 543. There is no doubt that
this rule prevails in actions for a tort, Preston v. Prather,
137 U. S. 604, and in actions for the failure to deliver
merchandise. Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat. 109. The principle is the same in a contract for the payment of marks.
The loss for which the plaintiff is entitled to be indemnified is "the loss of what the contractor would have lhd if
the contract had been performed," Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., 253 U. S. 97,
100; it happens at the moment when the contract is
broken, just as it does when a tort is committed, and the
plaintiff's claim is for the amount of that loss valued in
money at that time. The inconveniences and speculations that would be the result of a different rule have been
pointed out in arguments and decisions, and on the other
hand the momentary interest of the country of the forum
may be in favor of taking the date of the judgment, but
the conclusion to which we come seems to us to flow
from fundamental theory and not to need other support.
It is in accord with the decisions of several State Courts

HICKS v. GUINNESS.
71

Opinion of the Court.

and Circuit Courts of Appeals as well as of the English
House of Lords. Hoppe v. Russo-Asiatic Bank, 235 N. Y.

171. Simonoff v. Granite City National Bank, 279 Ill.

Industrie, 3 Fed. (2d) 931; S. S. Celia v. S. S. Volturno
[1921] 2 A. C. 544.
The denial of interest for the time covered by the war
seems to us wrong. The cause of action had accrued before the war began, Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall. 562, and
after it had accrued the question was no longer one of excuse for not performing a contract, but of the continuance
of a liability for damages that had become fixed. The
obligation of a contract is subject to implied exceptions,
but when a liability is incurred by wrong or default it is
absolute. Interest is due as one of its incidentals, and
inability to pay it no more excuses from that than it does
from the principal amount. Of course while the damages
remain unpaid, interest during one time is as necessary as
interest during another to effect the indemnification to
which the delinquent is held by the law. There are indications that local and momentary interests have led to
a diversity of decisions, but here again'what we regard
as principle has prevailed in later days, Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S. 243; Hugh Stevenson & Sons, Ltd. v.
Aktiengesellschaft fiir Cartonnagen-Industrie, [1918] A.
C. 239, 245; s. c. [1917] 1 K. B. 842, 850. The case of
Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall. 177, although criticized in the
last cited decision, is consistent on its facts with the principle adopted here, since war existed at the time when
the cause of action otherwise would have accrued, and it
very postibly might be held that war excuses the performanc% of a contract although it does not impair or
diminish a liability already fixed by law. Our decision
makes it unnecessary to consider arguments drawn from

prior to the Jurisdictional Act of February 13, 1925, was not affec.ted by that Act. P. 87.
2. Under Jud. Code ยงยง 128, 241, a decree of the Circuit Court of

3. Upon a motion to affirm, questions determined on a former appeal
of the case, after a full hearing followed by denial of a petition for
rehearing, and which were so determined by reaffirming and applying earlier decisions which covered the questions-can not
reasonably be regarded as debatable. P. 88.
4. On the former appeal in this case (236 U. S. 635) this Court held,
in substance:
(a) The purpose of the Act of May 23, 1828, c. 70, 4 Stat., 284,
in confirming the land grant in controversy, was not to create a
new right, but to recognize, in fulfilment of treaty obligations, a
right conferred by Spain while the land was under her dominion;
(b) As the grant contained a less acreage than a league square,
the confirmation by that Act was subject only to a needed survey
giving precision to the boundaries of the grant;
(c) When the survey was made, and received the approval of
the Surveyor General in 1851, the confirmation was complete and
the land was thenceforth effectively separated from the public
domain and subject to the taxing power of the State;
