of all the bank's property to be converted into money to
pay the bank's debts. The act of the directors made the
bank's insolvency notorious. The established rule of liberal construction requires that the priority act be applied
having regard to the public good it was intended to advance. Its application is not to be narrowly restricted to
the cases within the literal and technical meaning of the
words used. The things done in this case are not different in their substance from the things specified as the
ways in which insolvency is required to be made manifest.
It must be held that, within the meaning of the priority
act, the bank made a voluntary assignment of its property; and that, because of the bank's insolvency, a trustee was put in charge of its property under a state law
within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.

1. Taxes due the United States are "debts" within the meaning of
Rev. Stats. § 3466, giving the United States priority in certain
cases. P. 499.

3. The joining by a defendant corporation in securing a receivership
in a suit by a simple contract creditor, to take over the defendant's
property and business for the purpose of conserving them and paying creditors, amounts to a voluntary assignment, within the meaning of § 3466, Rev. Stats., where the business is in a failing condition and turns out to be insolvent so that the assets are a trust

receiver to pay claims of the United States as priority
claims. See Liberty Mutual Co. v. Johnson Shipyards,
6 Fed. (2d) 752; Stripe v. United States, post, p. 503.
Mr. Godfrey Goldmark, for petitioner.
The priority of the United States does not stand upon
any sovereign prerogative, but exclusively upon the provisions of the statute. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cr. 358;
United States v. Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29;
United States v. Canal Bank, 3 Story, 79 Fed. Cas. No. 14,
715; United States v. Oklahoma, 261 U. S. 253.
An examination of the earlier statutes, now §§ 3466
and 3467, in the light of their underlying purpose, will
reveal that they were intended primarily to secure the
prior payment of revenue Vhere the debtor was divested
of his property in the methods provided, and only later
were extended to secure prior payment of all obligations
to the United States, whatever their nature, and were intended to impose a personal liability upon executors and
trustees, in the event that the priority was ignored.
Whether revenues are collected through or without the
exaction of a bond, in either case, the statute measures
the extent of the priority. United States v. Chamberlain,
219 U. S. 250.
Lane v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 and Meriwether v. Garrett,
102 U. S. 472, distinguished.
In this case, the debtor has not been divested of its
property in any of the methods which the statute prescribes. Therefore, the priority created by § 3466 is inapplicable.
Section 3466 does not create a'priority for ordinary
debts or for taxes, where the assets of a corporation are
distributed in a judgment creditor's suit or equity receivership. United States v. Oklahoma, 261 U..S. 253;
[United F. & G. Co. v. Strain, 264 U. S. 570.
The appointment of a receiver on a judgment creditor's
bill is not a divesting of the debtor's title to all his prop-

Metropolitan St. Ry. Receivership, 208 U. S. 90; Luhrig
Collieriesv. InterstateCoal Co., 281 Fed. 265. The present suit is not the equivalent of a general assignment.

Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, 262 U. S. 77; Zacher v.
Fidelity Trust Co., 106 Fed. 593.
The admission of the allegations of the bill and the consent to the appointment of a receiver are not the commission of acts of bankruptcy within the meaning of § 3466.
The defendant has not committed an act of bankruptcy
within the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898.
There is no proof that insolvency existed at the time of
the filing of the bill or that the bill was filed because of
this condition. This being so, United States v. Oklahoma
and Strain v. United States, supra, are conclusive to the
effect that the receiver was not appointed because of insolvency. To the same effect are: Matter of Spalding,
139 Fed. 244; Matter of Valentine Pohl Co., 224 Fed.
685; Matter of William S. Butler & Co., 207 Fed. 705.
The fact that the defendant consented does not make the
suit collusive or other than the ordinary law suit in which
the defendant corporation is the defendant and not the
plaintiff. Even if the defendant did commit an act of
bankruptcy under the 1898 Bankruptcy Act, the United
States would not be entitled to priority, inasmuch as the
defendant has not been divested of its property in any
proceeding based upon the alleged act of bankruptcy.
Congress has by the Revised Statutes provided a comprehensive method for the collection of taxes and has
provided for a lien and distraint; and as the provisions
of Rev. Stats. §§ 3186, et seq. as amended in 1913,

PRICE v. UNITED STATES.

were not complied with in this case prior to the receivership, a tax claim is not entitled to priority. The facts
that the suit was instituted by one creditor on behalf of
all, a judgfient waived, and the other creditors enjoined
from proceeding to judgment, cannot increase the rights
of the United States. American & British Securities Co.
v. Mfg. Co., 275 Fed. 121.
This suit is a mere equitable levy in favor of all creditors, and they all have the same rights as if they were
separate judgment creditors, namely, the right to satisfy
their claims ahead of the Government, because the latter
did not comply with § 3186 as amended in 1913. As the
two common law prerogatives are embodied in §§ 3466
and 3186, et seq., and as no priority exists under the terms
of either, there can be no priority at all.
Solicitor General Mitchell and Messrs. Jerome Michael,
Henry Gale, and Ralph F. Fuchs, Special Assistants to the
Attorney General, for the United States.
By virtue of Rev. Stats. 3466 the Government is entitled to payment of its taxes in advance of the claims
of general creditors in an equity receivership proceeding
instituted with the defendant's consent.
The income tax involved in this case was entitled to
priority, of payment by virtue of the provisions of the
Revenue Acts by which it was levied and under which
it was assessed, by virtue of the provisions of Rev. Stats.
3186, and because, Congress having established an extrajudicial system for the collection of the internal revenue
which was designed to insure, and which in the absence of
judicial interference will normally result in, its prior payment, it is the plain duty of the courts either to permit
that system to function or, in the alternative, to direct
the payment of taxes in advance of the claims of general
creditors. If further evidence is required that Congress
intended the provisions of the Revenue Acts to apply

equally to all corporations, whether solvent or insolvent,
whether in receivership or under the management of the
corporate officers, it is to be found in those sections of
the Revenue Acts which requir6 a receiver who is operating the property or business of a corporation to make
returns for such corporation, and provide that any tax
due thereon is to be collected "in the same manner as if
collected from the corporation." Swarts v. Hammer, 194
U. S. 441.
If receivership proceedings had not intervened, the
Government would have acquired a lien upon all the property of the Gidding Company which would have been
valid against its general creditors. It is equally clear
that the appointment of a receiver can not render the
Government impotent to assess or to demand the payment of taxes. But if the Government can demand the
payment of a tax, it can also acquire a lien therefor in
spite of a receivership, for the result of a demand followed by failure to pay is prescribed by statute. It can
not be prescribed by the courts.
The argument that a statutory lien for taxes can and
does attach after the appointment of a receivet is fortified by the fact that even before assessment and demand
the Government's lien is inchoate. Henderson v. Mayer,
225 U. S. 631; Kane & Co. v. Kinney, 174 N. Y. 69;
Hildreth Granite Co. v. City of Watervliet (N. Y.), 161
App. Div. 420; Crane Co. v. Pneumatic Signal Co. (N.
Y.), 94 App. Div. 53. Neither the complainant, nor any
other general creditor, nor the receiver, is a judgment
creditor within 'the meaning of R. S. 3186.There is nothing in the doctrine of equitable execution
or in the character or purpose of a receivership proceeding initiated by general creditors, to prevent the creation
or perfection of statutory liens, including tax liens, after
the bill is filed. PennsylvaniaSteel Co. v. New York City

If, as this Court held in Re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164, it is the
duty of tax collectors to refrain from the seizure and sale
of property in the custody of the courts, it would seem to
be equally the duty of the courts to direct the prior payment of the Government's taxes. A receivership may
justify a variation of the means; it can not justify a
change in the result. The application of the doctrine that
a court of equity must direct the prior payment of taxes
in -a receivership proceeding if it stops the executive
machinery for their collection, extends as well to past as
to current taxes, as well to taxes which have not become,
as to taxes which are, liens-on the property in the court's
possession. Ledoux v. La Bee, 83 Fed. 761; Coy v. Title

Say. Bank, 98 Mo. 458; George v. St. Louis Ry. Co.,
44 Fed. 117; Gaitherv. Stockbridge, 67 Md. 222.
Independently of statute, the United States were entitled to priority of payment of both the customs duties
and the income tax involved in this case, because priority
of payment inheres in the very concept of a tax and the
right to priority of payment of taxes is an attribute of
the sovereignty of the Government. In levying taxes,
the Government is exercising one of the most important
of its sovereign powers. Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509.
A tax is not a debt. It is an impost levied for the support of the Government. It operates in invitum. Meriwether v. Garret, 102 U. S. 472; Crabtree v. Madden, 54
Fed. 426; City of Camden v. Allen, 26 N. J. L. 398. Taxes
are of higher order than debts, even than debts due the
Government, and in respect to them the Government is
not a creditor. United States v. Eggleston, Fed. Cas. No.

While the Government does not claim to be possessed
of the right to priority of payment of its taxes as a heritage from the British Crown, there is nevertheless a solid
foundation for the proposition that the United States
possess as sovereign rights those prerogatives of the kings
of England which the latter enjoyed as representatives of
the English people and which are not incongruous with
our republican form of Government. United States v.
Thompson, 98 U. S. 486; Dollar Savings Bank v. United
States, 19.Wall. 227. The fact that the Government has
no sovereign right to priority of payment of its debts is
immaterial. Food Controller v. Cork, (1923) A. C. 647;
Comm'rs ofTaxes v. Palmer (1907) A. C. 179; Baxter v.
Baxter, 23 S. C. 114; State v. Rowse, 49 Mo. 586. The
fact that the Government has never adopted the common
law is immaterial. Rev. Stats. 3466 does not measure the
Government's right to priority for taxes.
Mr. JUSTICE

BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court'

October 2, 1923, Charles H. Mears, a simple contract
creditor, brought suit on behalf of himself and other
creditors against J. M. Gidding & Company, a New York
corporation. Among the facts alleged in the complaint
are these. Defendant was engaged in the business of importing and selling wearing apparel at retail in New York
and four other cities. It owed plaintiff $10,000 on apromissory note; its debts were large, and it was without
money to pay those then due and shortly to become due.

PRICE v. UNITED STATES.
492

Opinion of the Court.

If its assets could be sold in the usual course of business
fhey would be in excess of its debts. Some of the creditors were pressing their claims, and others had commenced suit; and, if the assets were not taken into judicial
custody, some creditors might obtain inequitable preferences as against plaintiff and other creditors; and the
assets might not to be enough to pay all. And, averring
no adequate remedy at law, the complaint prayed the
court to determine the rights of all creditors, and to appoint a receiver to take possession and control of all defendant's assets, and that, when just and proper, the
assets be ordered sold and the proceeds distributed to
those entitled thereto. On the same day, defendant filed
its answer admitting the allegations and joining in the
prayer of the complaint. The court immediately entered
its decree granting the relief prayed, and appointed appellant temporary receiver with authority to take possession and control of, and to make disbursements to preserve, the assets. January 9, 1924, the court pppointed
appellant permanent receiver. Thereupon, the assets
were found insufficient to pay all the claims; general
creditors will not recover more than 40 per cent.
The United States filed proof of claims for income taxes
for the year 1920, and for unpaid customs duties. A special master sustained the claim of the United States to
priority, and fixed the amount of the income tax at
$11,331.07, and the amount of the duties at $1,086.70.
The District Court directed appellant, out of the assets
of defendant, to pay these amounts as priority claims.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree on the
authority of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Johnson Shipyards Corporation,6 Fed. (2d) 752. The case
is here on writ of certiorari. § 240, Judicial Code.
The word "debts" as used in R. S. § 3466 includes
taxes.
The claim of the United States does not rest upon any
sovereign prerogative; but the priority statutes were

500

enacted to advance the same public policy which governs
in the cases of royal prerogative; that is, to secure adequate public revenue to sustain the public burdens.
United States v. The State Bank of North Carolina,'6
Pet. 29, 35. And to that end, § 3466 is to be construed
liberally. Its purpose is not to be defeated by unnecessarily restricting the application of the word "debts"
within a narrow or technical meaning. Cf. Miller v.
Robertson, 266 U. S. 243, 248. The meaning properly
to be attributed to that word depends upon the connection in which it is used in the particular statute and the
purpose to be accomplished.
In the absence of another remedy made- exclusive, an
action of debt lies to recover taxes where the amount due
is certain or readily may be made certain. United States
v. Chamberlain, 219 U. S. 250, 262; Savings Bank v.
United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239; Stockwell v. United
States, 13 Wall. 531, 542; Meredith v. 'United States, 13
Pet. 486, 493; United States v. Washington Mills, 2 Cliff.
601, 607; United States v. Pacific Railroad, 4 Dill. 66.
Section 3466 of the Revised Statutes is derived from
early statutes enacted for the collection of taxes.* The
Act of 1789 permitted bonds to be given for payment of
* "An Act to regulate the Collection of the Duties imposed by law
on the tonnage of ships or vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandises imported into the United States," approved July 31, 1789, §
21, c. 5, 1 Stat. 29, 42. "An Act to provide more effectually for the
collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or
vessels," approved August 4, 1790, § 45, c. 35, 1 Stat. 145, 169. "An
Act for raising a farther sum of money for the protection of the frontiers, and for other purposes therein mentioned," approved May 2,
1792, § 18, c. 27, 1 Stat. 259, 263. "An Act to provide more effectually for the Settlement of Accounts between the United States, and
Receivers of public Money," approved March 3, 1797, § 5, c. 20, 1
Stat. 512, 515. "An Act to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage," approved March 2, 1799, § 65, c. 22, 1 Stat.

customs duties, and provided that in case of default the
collector should prosecute suits for recovery, and that in
all cases of insolvency, or where any estate in the hands
of executors or administrators should be insufficient to pay
all the debts of the deceased, the debt due to the United
States on any such bonds should be first satisfied. The
Act of 1790 superseded the earlier Act, but retained the
same priority provision'. The Act of 1792 gave to sureties
the right of subrogation (see R. S. § 3468); and it limited priority to cases in which insolvency should be manifested in one of the modes stated. Prior to the passage
of the Act of 1797, an internal revenue had been established and extensive transactions had taken place, in the
course of which many persons had become indebted to the
United States. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cr. 358, 392.
Up to that time, the priority applied only to cases of default on customs bonds. By that Act, it was extended to
cases involving "any revenue officer or other person hereafter becoming indebted to the United States by bond or
otherwise." The Act of 1799 introduced the provision
making every executor, administrator, assignee or other
person answerable for failure to pay the United States
first. See R. S. § 3467. The revision did not involve any
substantial change of phraseology and did not work any
change in the purpose or meaning of the priority acts.
Buck Stove Company v. Vickers, 226 U. S. 205, 213.
There is no reason for any distinction in respect of priority
between taxes and other amounts owing to the United
States. Indeed, it would be quite without reason to deny
priority in case of claims for taxes due from taxpayers,
and to give priority to claims against revenue officers and
others on account of taxes collected by them.
Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, and Meriwether v.
Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, are sometimes cited, and expressions found in the opinions are quoted, to show that taxes
are not debts. But when regard is had to the questions

269 U. S.

decided in these cases, it is clear that they do not sustain
the view that, as used in § 3466, the word "debts" does
not include taxes due the United States. The question
in Lane County v. Oregon was whether under the Acts of
Congress making United States notes "legal tender in
payment of all debts," the State was bound to accept such
notes in payment of taxes required by its own laws to
be paid in gold and silver coin. The court held that the
Acts had no reference to taxes imposed by state authority.
There were two clattses which were intended to give currency to the notes. In one of them, taxes were plainly
distinguished from debts; and it was held that the word
"debts" in the other was not intended to include taxes.
In Meriwether v. Garrett, it was held that taxes levied
before the repeal of a city charter-other than those
levied under lawful contract or judicial direction--could
not be continued in force by the court after the repeal
of the charter; that they had none of the elements of
property and could not be seized by judicial process,
and could only be collected under authority from the
legislature.
Defendant made a voluntary assignment of its property within the meaning of § 3466.
By answering and joining in the prayer of the complaint, defendant co6perated with the plaintiff to secure
the appointment of a receiver to whom it immediately
handed over possession and control of all its property
and business. While in effect the complaint alleged that
defendant was solvent, the facts set forth indicate that
it was in a failing condition. And it was found to be insolvent within a short time after the appointment of the
receiver. When the assets turned out to be less than the
debts, the creditors were entitled to have them dealt with
as a trust fund and distributed among them according to
their rights and priorities. Under the statute, claims of
the .United States must first be satisfied. Bramwell V.

In this case there is presented the question whether, in
the distribution of the assets of Johnson Shipyards Corporation among its creditors by receivers appointed in an
equity suit, the United States under R. S. § 3466 is en-'
titled to have its claim against the corporation for taxes
first satisfied. The facts (300 Fed. 952) are in all respects
similar to those in Price v. United States, ante, p. 492.
