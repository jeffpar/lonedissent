Statement of the Case.

explicitly enjoined upon the jury that there must be a
proximate and causal relation between the damages and
the negligence of the company and the reference to the
sum of $35,000 was a limitation of the amount stated in
the declaration. There could have been no misunderstanding of the purpose of the instruction.

PACIFIC MAIL STEAMSHIP COMPANY v.
SCHMIDT.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 323.

Argued April 25, 26, 1916.-Decided May 22, 1916.

Where the writ of certiorari was granted to review the question of law,
and evidently would not have been granted simply to reopen the
inquiry into the facts, this court will assume the lower courts were
right where they agreed upon the construction of the facts even
though otherwise it might hesitate to do so.
This court will not assume that Congress intended to cut off an opportunity to revise doubtful questions of law and fact by imposing
a penalty for reasonable delay in payment caused by an appeal based
on sufficient cause.
Under § 4529, Rev. Stat., as amended December 1, 1898, a shipowner
is not liable for the penalty for delay in payment of a seaman's
wages during the period between judgnaent in the District Court
and affirmance thereof by the Circuit Court of Appeals where, as
in this case, there was reasonable cause for prosecuting the appeal.
214 Fed. Rep. 513, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and applica-

tion of Rev. Stat., § 4529, as amended by the Act of December 21, 1898, are stated in the opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Argument for Respondent.

241 U. S.

Mr. William R. Harr, with whom Mr. Charles H. Bates,
Mr. George A. Knight and Mr. CharlesJ. Heggerty were on
the brief, for the petitioner.
Mr. James W. Ryan, by special leave, with whom Mr.
John L. McNab was on the brief, for the respondent:
Respondent rendered services as a seaman.
The respondent was under shipping articles, because
the articles were for a definite time and the respondent's
duties under the articles had not been completely performed.
The vessel was bound to a foreign port, because she was
bound to any part of the world and was registered for the
foreign trade, and Ancon, Canal Zone, is a foreign port.
The petitioner continuously refused, without any reasonable ground for dispute, to pay respondent the wages
actually earned and could have prevented the wages from
continuing.
The measure of damages decreed by the Court of Appeals is that provided by §4529, Rev. Stat., and victualling
money is a part of wages..
The Court of Appeals had power to give effect to the
statute by making the rate of interest on the decree of the
District Court such that the interest would equal the sum
which the statute provided should be recoverable by the
seaman.
The rate of interest in the admiralty is determinable at
the discretion of the appellate court.
There was a manifest error of law apparent upon the
face of the record in this case.
An appeal in admiralty from a District Court to the
Circuit Court of Appeals opens .the whole case for trial de
novo in the appellate court.
The appellate jurisdiction df the Circuit Court of
Appeals is the same as that of the Supreme Court from
1803 to 1875.

PACIFIC MAIL S. S. CO. v. SCHMIDT.
241 U. S.

Argument for Respondent.

The appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals is the same as that of the old Circuit Courts on appeals from the District Courts.
A seaman's wages continue until actually paid, notwithstanding intervening decrees of inferior courts.
The decree of the Court of Appeals should be modified
so that the respondent may recover two days' pay for
every day since November 4, 1915.

MR. JUsTIcE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a libel in personam for $30.33, wages and victualling money from September 24 to October 1, 1913, and
for a sum equal to one day's pay for every day during
which payment had been or should be delayed. The libel
was filed on October 20, 1913. On November 5, 1913,
the District Court entered a decree for $151.59 with
interest from the date of its decree and $36.25 costs.
209 Fed. Rep. 264. The libellee, the present petitioner,
appealed, but without success, and on May 18, 1914, the
decree was affirmed with directions to add one day's pay
for every day since the former decree. On October 6, 1914,
.an order was made by the Circuit Court of Appeals that
the petitioner should pay to the proctor for the appellee
the amount of the judgment of the District Court with
costs and proctor's fee as allowed, and should pay to the
Clerk of the District Court the additional amount to the
date of deposit of the penalty adjudged to be continuing;
to abide the result of an application to this court for a
writ of certiorari, and that upon such payment the running of the penalty should cease so far as the judgment
of the Circuit Court of Appeals was concerned.
The facts are these: On July 24, 1913, the libellant
shipped as chief steward, under articles, from San Francisco to Ancon, Canal Zone, and such other ports as the
master might direct and back to a final port of discharge
in San Francisco, for a term of time not exceeding six
calendar months. The vessel returned to San Francisco

PACIFIC MAIL S. S. CO. v. SCHMIDT.

241 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

on September 23, and on September 24, 1913, the libellant
was paid in full by the Shipping Commissioner and that
date noted as the date of termination of voyage on the
articles. As seems to have been usual, however, the libellant remained on board working and in the ordinary
course probably would have signed new articles for the
next voyage, but on October 1 was notified that he was
discharged. On his demanding his wages for his services
in port he was told that silverware to the amount of
$32.90 was missing, that he was accountable for it and
this sum offset his claim. There is no doubt that this
offset, which was alleged again in the pleadings, was set
up in good faith, but as both the courts below have found
that it was not made out we assume that it was not proved.
The statute under which the penalty was imposed is

Rev. Stat., §4529, as amended by the act of December 21,
1898, c. 28, § 4; 30 Stat. 756. By that act "the master or
owner of any vessel making coasting voyages shall pay
to every seaman his wages within two days after the
termination of the agreement under which he shipped,
or at the time such seaman is discharged, whichever first
happens; and in the case of vessels making foreign voyages,
or from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or
vice versa, within twenty-four hours after the cargo has
been discharged, or within four days after the seaman
has been discharged, whichever first happens. .
Every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make
payment in manner hereinbefore mentioned without
sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to
one day's pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods." We
assume, not only as we have said that the claim of offset
was not established, but the more doubtful proposition
that it did not furnish sufficient cause for the delay. We
assume therefore that the petitioner did not sufficiently
justify putting the libellant to a suit.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

But it is far less clear that the District Court was justified in treating the case as within the penalties of the act.
The statute deals with voyages. The voyage for which
the libellant shipped was at an end, viz., from San Francisco out and back to that port, or till the end of six
months, whichever first happened. On the return to
San Francisco within the time the libellant was paid all
that was due to him, and he himself lays his employment
as beginning in San Francisco on September 25 after the
voyage described in the articles was at an end. No new
articles had been signed and it would seem on the allegations of the libel coupled with the admitted facts that
the libellant's legal standing was under an oral contract
for a few days in port while hoping to be reshipped.
It seems to us a very strong thing to say that any fair
construction of the facts brings the case within the act.
But as the two courts have agreed upon this proposition also and as the writ would not have been granted
to reopen the inquiry into those particular facts we assume that upon this also they were right.
It is a very different thing, however, to say that the
delay occasioned by the appeal was not for sufficient cause.
Even on the assumption that the petitioner was wrong
it had strong and reasonable ground for believing that
the statute ought not to be held to apply. So that the
question before us is whether we are to construe the act
of Congress as imposing this penalty during a reasonable
attempt to secure a revision of doubtful questions of'law
and fact, although its language is 'neglect . . . without sufficient cause.' The question answers itself. We
are not to assume that Congress would attempt to cut
off the reasonable assertion of supposed rights by devices
that have had to be met by stringent measures when
practiced by the States. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123.
There was sufficient cause for the neglect to pay after
the decree of the District Court, since the payment of

PACIFIC MAIL S. S. CO. v. SCHMIDT.

.251

Opinion of the Court.

the original wages without the penalty that was reasonably in dispute would neither have been accepted nor
allowed.
Not only so, but there was further reasonable cause
for the delay by appeal in the fact that victualling money
was included in the wages by which the penalty was
measured. Seeing that the petitioner was held as if the
articles still were in force the question arises how the wages
could be estimated at more than the articles fixed. The
so-called port pay which added a dollar a day for food
was an arrangement altogether outside the articles, and
the demand for it and the allowance of it not only raised
a new question but intensified the doubt as to how it
could be said that the voyage was not ended and that the
penalty could be applied. See PalaceShipping Co., Ltd., v.
Caine, [1907] A. C. 386. We shall allow the decree of the
District Court to stand, as we have stated, but there
was ample justification for the appeal and on both the
above grounds sufficient reason for the delay. We need
not consider whether if there had been no such reason
there would be any escape from Massachusettsv. West. Un.
Tel. Co., 141 U. S. 40, where under a similar statute it
seems to have been held that the penalty stopped with
the decree below.
Decree reversed.
Decree of District Court affirmed.
