APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 24. Argued January 26, 1916.-Decided May 1, 1916.
In determining whether the. admiralty has jurisdiction over an incompleted structure in navigable waters to be used when completed as
a governmental aid to navigation; its location and purpose are controlling from the time it was begun. •
The jurisdiction that admiralty has over an incompleted structure in
course of construction extends to that'which is a mer6 incident to
such construction.
.The admiralty has jurisdiction of a libel in rem against a vessel for
damages caused by its colliding with an incompleted beacon in
course of construction in, and surrotinded by, navigable waters aftd
which when completed is to be used solely as a governmental aid to
navigation.
186 Fed. Rep. 849, reversed in part.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction J.
,in admiralty
of the District Court of a libel in rem against a vessel

for damages caused by its colliding with an incompleted

beacon in navigable water, are stated in the opinion.

THE RAITHMOOR:
241 U. S.

Argument for Appellee.

An unfinished structure, for whatever purpose intended,
is not an aid to navigation. So far as it has anything to
do with navigation, it is an obstruction and a source of
danger. Neither is it subject to admiralty jurisdiction unless it is an instrumentality of the Government. These
two elements must coexist in order to bring the case
within the rule laid down by The Blackheath.
A drawbridge is an aid to navigation. It has no other
purpose. It is a disadvantage to the bridge itself. It is
never employed except where vessels have a right to pass.
It is thus an aid to navigation just as truly as a beacon
is, though in a different way. Yet an injury to it is not
cognizable in admiralty. The John C. Sweeney, 55 Fed.
Rep. 540; Martin v. West, 222 U. S.191. So also a swinging bridge. Milwaukee v. The Curtis, 37 Fed. Rep. 705.
The reason is obvious. The drawbridge is not a Government aid to navigation.
Since The Blackheath was reported, two cases, Cleveland
Terminal Co. v. Steamship Co., 208 U. S. 316, and The
Troy, Id. 321, have come before this court, and it has
decided that the doctrine of The Plymouth is still in force,
unaffected by The Blackheath.
Although the injury was committed in navigable water
there is no case actually deciding that the sole test of
jurisdiction in cases of tort is locality. The true meaning
of the rule of locality in cases of maritime torts is that
the wrong -and injury complained of must have been
committed wholly upon the high seas or navigable waters.
The rule goes no farther than this. The Plymouth, 3
Wall. 34.
A tort must be committed wholly upon navigable
waters, but the converse is not true. It is not the law
that everything that takes place upon navigable waters
is cognizable in admiralty. Such a doctrine would lead
to absurd consequences. If a malicious or negligent act
were committed by a bather in the surf at Atlantic City,

causing the death of another by drowning, the widow
would proceed to obtain redress by filing a libel, on the
ground that the cause of action arose wholly in navigable
water.
Whether a certain tort is maritime must be resolved
according to the character and locality of the injured
thing. Martin v. West, 222 U. S. 191, 197; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52; Campbell v. Hackfeld
Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 696; Cleveland Terminal R. R. v. Cleveland S. S. Co., 208 U. S.316, 321.
The temporary platform was placed around the building which was under construction solely for the purpose
of aiding in the work; and, in its legal aspect was on the
same footing as the tools used by the laborers. It was
not maritime in its character or in its object.
The jurisdiction of the Federal courts in admiralty
cases is given by the Constitution. Not even Congress
has power to add anything to it. If a subject is not within
this class, the courts can take no cognizance of it, whether
or not it is connected, as to time and place, with some
others which they clearly have power to adjudicate.
The St. David, 209 Fed. Rep. 985.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The appellant filed a libel in rem in the admiralty
against the steamship "Raithmoor" to recover damages
for tort. The steamship, coming up the Delaware River
on the evening of July 18, 1909, collided with a scow
and pile dr-ver belonging to the appellant, and also with
a structure which the appellant was erecting for the United
States to serve as a beacon, and with a temporary platform used in connection with the work of construction.
For the injury to the scow and pile driver, a decree was
entered in favor of the libellant. But the District Court

THE RAITHMOOR.
241 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

held that there was no jurisdiction in the admiralty of
the claim for the damage to the structure and platform,
and the libellant appeals. The Raithmoor, 186 Fed. Rep.
849.
The District Court thus states the character and location of the structure:
"The company" (the appellant) "was executing an
independent contract with the United States, which
bound them to furnish the necessary materials, labor,
plant, etc., and to erect in place a foundation pier to
receive a gas beacon. The work was under the continual
supervision of a government official, but had neither been
finished nor accepted. The structure was to consist of
three cylindrical piles of reinforced concrete to be sunk
about 19-2 feet into the bottom of the river, and to
project 12 feet above mean high water, these to be covered with a sheet steel cap. The piles were to be encased
in steel arid to be protected also by depositing rip-rap
around them to a specified height. When completed,
the pier was to be used solely as a beacon on the edge of
a navigable channel that has not yet been made ready,
and the government was to install upon the cap a lamp
and other appliances. The site is three-fourths of a mile
from the eastern or New Jersey shore, and about two
miles from the western or Delaware shore, of the river,
and is surrounded by navigable water, about twentyseven feet deep at low tide. The work was begun in June,
and at the time of the collision was approaching comple-"
tion. The piles were in place, and not much remained
to be done except to put the metal cap into place and
deposit the rip-rap. The necessities of the work required
a temporary platform to be built close to the concrete
piles. This was of wood, about 15 feet square, and rested
upon wooden piling driven into the bottom of the river."
Id., p. 850.
The decisions of this court with respect to the jurisdic-

Opinion of the Court.

241U. S.

tion of the admiralty in cases of tort make the question
to be determined a very narrow one. In The Plymouth,
3 Wall. 20, 36, it was broadly declared that "the whole,
or at least the substantial cause of action, arising out of
the .wrong, must be complete within the locality upon
which the jurisdiction depends--on the high seas or the
navigable waters." Accordingly it was held that a libel
for damage to a wharf and storehouses caused by a fire
started on a vessel through negligence was beyond the
limit of admiralty cognizance, as the damage was wholly
done, and the wrong was thus consummated, upon the
land. Upon this ground, the jurisdiction of the District
Court to entertain a petition for the limitation of the
liability of the ship owner in such a case was denied in
Ex parte Phenix Insurance Co., 118 U. S. 610. The prinCiple was restated in Johnson v. Chicago &c. Elevator
Co., 119 U. S. 388, 397. And see Knapp, Stout & Co. v.
McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638, 643; Homer, Ramsdell Co. v.
La Compagnie (bntrale Tran.satlantique, 182 U. S. 406,
411. But in The Blackheath, 195 U. S. 361, a distinction
was drawn, and the jurisdiction of the admiralty was
upheld in the case of an injury caused by a vessel in negligently running into a beacon which stood fifteen or
twenty feet from the channel of Mobile river, or bay,
in water twelve or fifteen feet deep, and was built on piles
driven firmly into the bottom. The court pointed out
the essential basis of the decision, in saying: "It is enough
to say that we now are dealing with an injury to a government aid to navigation from ancient times subject to the
admiralty, a beacon emerging from the water, injured by
the motion of the vessel, by a continuous act beginning
and consummated upon navigable water, and giving character to the effects upon a point which is only technically
land, through a connection at the bottom of the sea."
(Id., p. 367.) It was suggested in the concurring opinion
of Mr. Justice Brown (Id., p. 368) that the decision

THE RAITHMOOR.
241 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

practically overruled the earlier cases, and that it recognized the principle of the English statute extending the
jurisdiction of the admiralty court to "any claim for
damages by any ship." This consequence, however, was
expressly denied in Cleveland Terminal R. R. v. Cleveland Steamship Co., 208 U. S. 316, 320. In that case it
was decided that the admiralty did not have jurisdiction
of a claim for damages caused by a vessel adrift, through
its alleged fault, to the center pier of a bridge spanning a
navigable river and to a shore abutment and dock. Referring to The Blackheath, and drawing the distinction we
have noted, the court said: "The damage" (that is, in
The Blackheath) "was to property located in navigable
waters, solely an aid to navigation and maritime in nature,
and having no other purpose or function. . . . But
the bridges, shore docks, protection piling, piers, etc.," (of
the Cleveland Terminal Company) "pertained to the
land. They were structures connected with the shore
and immediately concerned bommerce upon land. None
of these structures were aids to navigation in the maritime
sense, but extensions of the shore and aids to commerce
on land as such." The decision in The Troy, 208 U. S,
321, was to the same effect. The steamer Troy had
collided with the center pier of a swinging span over the
St. Louis river, a navigable stream, and the jurisdiction
of the admiralty of a libel for the injury was denied. See,
also, Phaonix Construction Co. v. The Poughkeepsie, 212
U. S.558; Martin'v. West, 222,U. S. 191, 197.
If then, in the present instance, the metal cap of the
beacon had been in place, the rip-rap deposited, and the
beacon put into actual service, the case would fall exactly
within the ruling of The Blackheath and the admiralty
would have jurisdiction although the structure was attached to the bottom. There would be no difference in
the two cases which would afford the slightest ground for
argument. If, on the other hand, simply because of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

incompleteness of the beacon, it is to be exclusively identified with the land and its intended purpose is to be disregarded, the admiralty would have no jurisdiction. We
think that a distinction based solely on the fact that the
beacon was not fully completed would be a needless refinement,-a nicety in analysis not required by reason or
precedent. We regard the location and purpose of the
structure as controlling from the time the structure was
begun. It was not being built on shore and awaiting the
assumption of a maritime relation. It was in course of
construction in navigable waters, that is, at a place where
the jurisdiction of admiralty in cases of tort normally
attached,-at least in all cases where the wrong was of
a maritime character. See The Plymouth, supra; Atlantic
Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52, 58-61, and cases
there cited. The relation of the structure to the land was
of the Imost technical sort, merely through the attachment
to the bottom; it had no connection, either actual or
anticipated, with commerce on land. It was simply to
serve as an aid to navigation, and while it had not yet
been finished and accepted, it was being erected under
the constant supervision of a Government inspector acting
under the authority of the United States in the improvement and protection of navigation. It is urged that the
Government might abandon its plan; but there has been
no abandonment. The question is not as to an abandoned
mass, but as to a beacon in course of erection. Even a
completed beacon might be abandoned and whatever
question might arise in such a case is not presented here.
Again, an analogy is suggested to the case of a vessel which
is being constructed on shore, but the argument falls short,
as it is to be remembered that as soon as a vessel is
launched, although still incomplete, it is subject to the
admiralty jurisdiction. Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S.
424, 438. This is not the case of a structure which at any
time was identified with the shore, but from the beginning

of construction locality and design gave it a distinctively
maritime relation. When completed and in use, its injury
by a colliding ship would interfere, or tend to interfere,
with its service to navigation; and, while still incomplete,
such an injury would tend to postpone that service. We
know of no substantial reason why the jurisdiction of the
admiralty should be sustained in the one case and denied
in the other.
With respect to the temporary platform, it is to be
observed that this was a mere incident to the structure
and as such the jurisdiction would extend to the claim
for the damage to it.
The decree, so far as it dismissed the libel for want of
jurisdiction, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
