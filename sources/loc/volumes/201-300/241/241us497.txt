SPOKANE & INLAND EMPIRE RAILROAD COMPANY v. CAMPBELL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 325. Argued April 26, 1916.-Decided June 12, 1916.
In an action under the Employers' Liability Act brought by an engineer
of an interstate electric road, for injuries resulting from a collision
the jury found a general verdict fdr plaintiff; and, in accordance with
the practice of the State, made special findings that the violation by
plaintiff of orders received before starting was the proximate cause of
the collision and that immediately before the collision the brakes on
the train were insufficient to enable him to control the speed of the
train. Held that:
On the record the jury must have found that the defective ait
brakes were a proximate cause of the collision.
Under the Safety Appliance Act, if the equipment was defective
or out of repair the question of whether it was attributable to the
company's negligence or not is immaterial.
An electric interstate road is not exempted from the requirements of the Safety Appliance Act-because its terminals run over
street railways. Spokane &c. v. United State8, ante, p. 344.
The fact that an employee may have violated an order does not
take him from the protection of the Safety Appliance Act; if, as an
actual fact, the brakes were defective and such defectiveness was
a proximate cause of the injury.
Proof that an employee violated an order is not proof that he did
so'wilfully; and where wilfulness is not found such violation is only
negligence and not a departure from the course of employment.
The right of an employe e of an interstate carrier by rail to recover for an injury depends upon the Acts of Congress, to which
all state legislation affecting the subject-matter yields.
Where the contributory negligence of the injured employee and
the defendant's violation of the Safety Appliance Act are concurrent proximate causes the Employers' Liability Act requires
the former to be disregarded.
Quewre whether under the conformity act (Rev. Stat. 914) the
Federal trial court is required to adhere to the state practice governing the effect of a general verdict and special findings.

Mr. B. H. Kiser were on the brief, for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. H. Lowndes Maury, with whom Mr. E. H. Belden,
Mr. W. C. Losey and Mr. H. R. Newton were on the brief,
for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE

PITNEY

delivered the opinion of the court.

This action was brought by Campbell in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington to recover damages for personal injuries, and was
based upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act of
April 22, 1908 (c. 149; 35 Stat. 65), and the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, as amended March 2, 1903
(c. 196; 27 Stat. 531; c. 976; 32 Stat. 943). A judgment
in plaintiff's favor was affirmed by the.Circuit Court of
Appeals (217 Fed. Rep. 518), and the case comes here on
writ of error.
At the time of Campbell's injury, July 31, 1909, the
company was operating a single track electric railway
between the city of Spokane in the State of Washington
and the town of Cceur d'Alene in the State of Idaho. It
was operated under standard railroad rules. The running time of regular trains was fixed by a time table,
upon which they were designated by numbers. Special
trains were run by telegraphic orders given by a train
dispatcher, whose office was in Spokane. Under the rules,
regular trains were superior to special trains, and specials
were required to look out for and keep out of the way of

SPOKANE & INLAND R. R. v. CAMPBELL.

Opinion of the Court.

the regulars. Unless a special train had orders from the
train dispatcher fixing a meeting point with the regular
train, or in some other way giving it a right to disregard
the time when the latter was due according to the time
table, it was required to be clear of the main line at any
point five minutes before the regular train was due at
that point according to the time table. Campbell was
an experienced motorman, had been in the company's
employ for several years, and was conversant with its
rules and its methods of train operation. On the day
he was injured he was the motorman in charge of a special
train running between Spokane and Cceur d'Alene, made
up of a combined motor and passenger car and two trailers,
and referred to in the train orders as Motor 5, that being
the number of the motor car. The train was equipped
with Westinghouse air brakes. After several trips between the termini, it was at Ccetir d'Alene about 4.30
o'clock in the afternoon, ready to start for Spokane when
ordered to do so. Regular train No. 20 was about due to
arrive. Under orders presently to be mentioned, the
nature of which was in dispute, Campbell started his
train west from Cceur d'Alene, and had proceeded some
distance when he discovered a train approaching on the
same track from the opposite direction. Upon seeing
this he applied the brakes, Without success, and there
was a collision, in which he received serious personal
injuries. The train with which he collided was regular
No. 20.
His complaint in the action counted upon two grounds
of recovery: (a) That the company, through its agents
and employees, negligently instructed him to proceed
with his train from Ccur d'Alene to Spokane, and to.
meet and pass No. 20 at the town of Alan, a station west
of the point of collision; and (b) That the collision was
directly due to the failure of the company to furnish him
with a motor and train supplied with proper air brakes

in working condition. The action was tried before the
District Court and a jury, when evidence was introduced
to the following effect:
Campbell testified that having arrived in Cceur d'Alene
with his train about 4.20 p. in., and brought it into position to return to Spokane, he received through the conductor, Whittlesey, orders both written and oral for the
running of the train; that the written order said that
"Motor 5 would run special Coeur d'Alene to Spokane
and would meet Number 20 at Alan;" that when the
written order was received Campbell was in his cab, ready
to start, and that the conductor on delivering the order
to him, said: "All right, go ahead; get out of town."
Campbell was unable to produce the written order. If
its contents were as-he testified, he was justified in at
once leaving Coeur d'Alene and running to Alan, the
order giving him a right of way over all trains to that
point. But defendant's evidence was to the effect that
the written order actually read: "Motor 5 will run spl.
C. d'Alene to Spokane, meet spl. 4 east at Man." Campbell admitted that if this was in fact the order it did not
authorize him to leave Cceur d'Alene before No. 20 came
in, for it made no mention of that train, and did not supersede the' right given to it by rules and time table. Nor
was it contended in his behalf that the conductor's verbal
order could in any way modify the written order. It
appeared that there was a land registration in progress
at Cceur d'Alene, and because of the resulting rush of
travel incoming trains stopped at the west end of the
yard and went on a Y switch, where the train was turned
and then backed down to the Cceur d'Alene station, while
trains ready to leave Cceur d'Alene upon the arrival of an
incoming train would run to the end of the yard between
the legs of the Y, wait there for the incoming train, and
pull out as soon as it headed in on the Y. Whittlesey
testified that he intended the train to go to the Y and

Opinion of the Court.

wait there for No. 20. Because, as Campbell testified,
his orders were to go to Alan to meet No. 20, he did not
stop at the Y. He testified that soon after passing this
point, and while running at about 30 miles per hour
(there was a slight descending grade), he saw an eastbound train (it was proved to be No. 20), coming on the
same track at a distance which from his testimony and
that of others might have been found to be upwards of
800 feet. He immediately shut off the power, and then
"dynamited her," that is, threw his air brake into emergency so as to apply the air pressure upon the train brakes
to the full capacity. He testified in effect that the brakes
took hold properly, and held for approximately 35 or
40 feet, when the air released (another witness said it
"leaked off"), and after that there was nothing he could
do to stop the train except to reverse, which he endeavored
to do but without success. There was no hand brake.
He testified that if the air brakes had worked properly
he could have stopped his train and avoided a collision;
that when they took hold they reduced the speed to about
20 miles per hour; that when released the train shot forward at approximately 18 or 20 miles an hour; "then I
stopped it a little bit with my reverse, so that at the
moment of collision I think we were going about fifteen
miles an hour." No. 20 meanwhile had been brought
almost if not quite to a stop.
Under instructions from the trial court the jury, besides returning a general verdict, which was in favor of
the plaintiff with $7,500 damages, made three special
findings in writing: (1) That Campbell before leaving
Coeur d'Alene received a train order reading as follows:
"Motor 5 will run Spl. C. d'Alene to Spokane, meet
special 4 east at Alan;" (2) that the air brakes on Campbell's train immediately before the collision were insufficient to enable him to control the speed of the train; (3)
that Campbell's leaving Coeur d'Alene in violation of

his orders was the proximate cause of the accident. There
was a motion for judgment in favor of defendant on the
special findings notwithstanding the general verdict,
which was denied, and it is to this ruling as well as to
certain instructions given and refused to be given that
the assignments of error are addressed.
The general verdict and the special findings were taken
pursuant to the state practice prescribed by certain sections of the Code permitting the trial judge to instruct
the jury, if they render a general verdict, to find upon
particular questions of fact to be stated in writing, and
providing that "When a special finding of facts shall be
inconsistent with the general verdict, the former shall
control the latter, and the court shall give judgment
accordingly." 1 Rem. & B. Ann. Code, §§ 364, 365. The
rule established by decisions of the Supreme Court of the
State is that where the general verdict and the special
findings can be harmonized by taking into consideration
the entire record of the cause including the evidence and
the instructions to the jury, and construing it liberally
for that purpose, it is the duty of the court to harmonize
them, and that where a special finding is susceptible of
two constructions, one of which will support the general
verdict and the other will not, that construction shall
be adopted which will support the general verdict. Pepperall v. City Park Transit Co., 15 Washington, 176,
180, 183; Mercier v. Travelers Ins. Co., 24 Washington,
147, 153, 154; McCorkle v. Mallory, 30 Washington, 632,

Sudden & Christenson v. Morse, 55 Washington, 372, 375;
Cameron v. Stack-Gibbs Lumber Co., 68 Washington, 539,
544.
Whether under the Conformity Act (Rev. Stat., § 914)
the trial court was required to adhere to the state practice
governing the effect of the general verdict and the special
findings may not be free from doubt. See Nudd v. Bur-

Rep. 368, 372.
The Court of Appeals held (217 Fed. Rep. 523) that the
Federal courts are not bound by local rules of practice
with respect to submitting special findings along with a
general verdict, or with respect to interpreting such verdicts; and that in this case it must be determined, as
matter of law, and without reference to the testimony,
whether the special findings entitled defendant to judgment notwithstanding the general verdict.
We find it unnecessary to decide the question of practice, and laying aside all technicalities will assume, in
favor of plaintiff in error, that the verdict is to be interpreted according to the local rule-that is, by reading
the special findings in the light of the issues and the
evidence, but in the light also of the general verdict, so
as to arrive at the true intent and meaning of the jury.
So considered, the findings establish that there was no
negligence on the part of the company in giving Campbell
his running orders; that he received the order to meet
Special 4 east at Alan, which, according to the admitted
effect of the rules of the company, meant that he should
not leave Cceur d'Alene until the arrival of regular No. 20;
that he left Cceur d'Alene in disregard or violation of his
orders, and that this was "the proximate cause" of the
accident. At the same time, the special findings establish
that the air brakes on his train immediately before the
collision were insufficient to enable him to control the
speed of the train. And the general verdict, so far as

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

it is 9upported by the evidence, must be taken as establishing every other fact in issue, not eliminated by the
instructions Of the trial court, that may be necessary to
sustain the recovery. To quote from the brief of plaintiff
in error: "The special findings establish that the general
'verdict was based solely upon the theory of negligence in
the air brake equipment of the train." But the general
verdict, interpreted in the light of the instructions given
by the trial court to the jury, means not merely that the
braking equipment was defective, but that this was a
proximate cause of he collision. The instruction upon
this point was: "If .
.
you find from a preponderance of the testimony that the air brakes on the car and
train operated by the plaintiff were defective and out of
repair at and immediately prior to the time of the collision,
and that the defective condition of the air brakes was the
direct and proximate cause of the collision, or contributed directly and proximately to the collision, and to
the injury to the plaintiff, your verdict will be for the
plaintiff. .
. And before you can return a verdict
for the plaintiff based on the allegation that the brakes
were defective and out of :repair, you must be satisfied
from a preponderance of the testimony not only that the
brakes were in fact defective or out of repair, but that
their defective condition was the direct or proximate
cause of the collision, as I have defined that term to you."
It is true !that other parts of the charge indicate that the
trial court entettained the view that the proximate cause
must be either Campbell's disobedience of orders or the
defective air brake equipment, and that these two things
could not concur as proximate causes. But he did not
bind the jury by instructions to that effect; and viewing
the general verdict and the special findings together, in
the light of the issues, the evidence, and the entire charge,
it is evident, we repeat, that the jury"must have found
that the defective air brakes were a proximate cause of

SPOKANE & INLAND R. R. v. CAMPBELL.,
241 U. S.

505

Opinion of the Court.

the collision. In view of the testimony already mentioned,
to the effect that Campbell, after discovering train No. 20,
would have had ample time to avoid the collision had the
train brake equipment been adequate, the conclusion of
the jury was in this respect not unreasonable.
It is insisted that there was no evidence that the provision of the Safety Appliance Act respecting train brakes
was violated. It is of course settled that if the equipment was in fact defective or out of repair, the question
whether this was attributable to the company's negligence is immaterial. St. Louis &c. Ry. v. Taylor, 210
U. S. 281, 294; Chicago &c. Ry. v. United States, 220
U. S. 559, 575; Tex. & Pac.Ry. v. Rigsby, ante, pp. 33, 43.
Hence' the argument is that, according to all of the evidence, the equipment was not defective or out of repair.
It appeared without dispute that it consisted of the Westinghouse standard automatic air brake, such as is in general
use throughout the country upon passenger trains. A
witness in defendant's employ testified that shortly before Campbell took the train out from Cceur d'Alene on
te trip in question he inspected the air brakes and found
them in perfect order. But there was much evidence
besides that of Campbell himself to the effect that when he
applied the emergency the brakes took hold and then
leaked off so as to release the brakes. The jury was
warranted in finding from the testimony as a whole that
Campbell properly applied the air when 600 feet or more
from the place where the collision occurred, and that the
brakes refused to work. Expert: witnesses called by defendant testified in effect that the train could have been
stopped inside of 300 feet if the brakes had been in proper
order. The air brake equipment was wrecked in the collision, so that there was no explanation of the cause of its
failure to operate properly; but it was a reasonable inference that there was some defect or want of repair in
the valves or packing.

241 U. S.

Next, it is insisted that Campbell's train was not such
as the Safety Appliance ActA require to be equipped with
air brakes. In Spokane & Inland Empire R. R. Co. v.
United States, decided June 5, 1916, ante, p. 344, we held
that this same railroad, with respect to its interurban
traffic, is subject to the provisions of those Acts respecting
automatic couplers, and hand-holds or grab-irons at the
ends of the cars. In that case the particular reliance of
the company was upon the concluding clause of the first
section of the 1903 amendment (32 Stat. 943), which
excepts trains, cars,, etc., "which are used upon street
railways." In the present case a distinction is sought to
be drawn between steam and electric roads, the argument
being that the provision requiring power brakes, when
read in connection with the context, indicates that trains
drawn by steam locomotives and operated by a locomotive engineer were alone within the contemplation of
Congress. It is true that in the Act of 1893 the provision
was closely associated with the mention of a locomotive
engine as the motive power; the words of § 1 being: "
"It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged
in interstate commerce by railroad to use on its line any
locomotive engine in moving interstate traffic not equipped
with a power driving-wheel brake and appliances for
operating the train-brake system, or to run any train
in such traffic [after a specified date] that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or
train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing
such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose."
Section 6, prescribing penalties, also uses the words
"locomotive engine" and "locomotives." But the 1903
amendment, which, as frequently pointed out, was enacted
for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the Act (Southern Ry. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20, 26; Southern Ry.
v. Crockett, 234 U. S. 725, 735), in its first section declares

SPOKANE & INLAND R. R. v. CAMPBELL.
241 U. S.

507

Opinion of the Court.

that the provisions relating to train brakes (among others)
shall be held to apply to "all trains, locomotives, tenders,
cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged
in interstate commerce . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith," subject to exceptions not now pertinent. The second section declares that whenever any
train is operated with power or train brakes, "not less
than fifty per centum of the cars of such train shall have
their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the
locomotive drawing such train." Of course, an important
object of having a train equipped with a system of brakes
under the single control of the engineer is to permit of a
prompt and effective reduction of speed when the man
driving the train is notified of danger. The importance
of this is precisely the same whatever be the motive
power, and, in view of the beneficial purpose of the Act
and the evident intent of Congress to enlarge its scope
so far as necessary to guard against the dangers in view,
the term "similar vehicles" must be held to have the
effect of bringing electric motors and trains drawn bythem within the provision respecting power or train
brakes. The very exemption of trains, cars, and locomotives "used upon street railways" indicates that
electric cars were in contemplation. And see Omaha
Street Ry. v, Interstate Com. Comm., 230 U. S. 324, 337;
Kansas City Ry. v. McAdow, 240 U. S. 51, 54.
It is said that, conceding the power brake provision
applies to electric trains, the duty imposed was not owed
to Campbell under the special circumstances established
by the jury's findings. The argument is that the purpose
of the brake requirements is to place control of the train
in the hands of the engineer so that the safety of passengers
and employees may be conserved, not that the engineer
should be able to escape injury from peril to which he had
wrongfully exposed himself; and that Campbell cannot

Opinion of the-Court.

241 U. S.

bring himself within the class intended to be protected .by
pointing out that the situation created by his disobedienoe
of orders was one that Congress contemplated as possible
and the consequences of which it desired to guard against.
This gives altogether too narrow a meaning to the Safety
Appliance Act, and is iftconsistent with the provisions of
the Employers' Liability Act, as we shall see.
It is most earnestly insisted that the findings establish
that Campbell was not in the course of his employment
when he was injured, and consequently that judgment
could not properly be entered in his favor upon the cause
of action established by the general verdict. This invokes
the doctrine that where an employee voluntarily and
without necessity growing out of his work abandons the
employment and steps entirely aside from the line of his
duty, he suspends the relation of employer and employee
and puts himself in the attitude of a stranger or a licensee.
The cases cited are those where an employee intentionally
has gone outside of the scope of his employment or departed from the place of duty. The present case is not
of that character; for Campbell, as the j*ury might and
presumably did find, had no thought of stepping aside
from the line of his duty. From the fact that he disregarded and in effect violated the order as actually communicated to him it of course does not necessarily follow
that he did this willfully. The jury was not bound to
presume-it would hardly be reasonable to presumethat he deliberately and intentionally ran his train out
upon a single track on which 'he knew an incoming train
with superior rights was then due. However plain his
mistake, the jury reasonably might find it to be -no more
than a mistake attributable to mental aberration, or inattention, or failure for some other reason to apprehend or
comprehend the order communicated to him. In its legal
effect this was nothing more than negligence on his part,
and not a departure from the course of his employment.

SPOKANE & INLAND R. R. v. CAMPBELL.
241 U. S.

509

Opinion of the Court.

To hold otherwise would have startling consequences.
The running of trains on telegraphic orders is an everyday occurrence on every railroad in the country. Thousands of cases occur every day and every night where a
failure by conductor or engineer to comprehend or to
remember the message of the train dispatcher may endanger the lives of employees and passengers. We are not
aware that in any case it has been seriously contended
that because an engineer violated the orders he went
outside of the scope of the employment. If he did so, in
the sense of absolving the employer from the duty of
exercising care for his safety, it is not easy to see upon
what principle the employer's liability to passengers or to
fellow employees for the consequences of his negligence
could be maintained. The unsoundness of the contention
is so apparent that further discussion is unnecessary.
Plaintiff in error refers to the fact that the wreck occurred in Idaho, and cites two sections of the Criminal
Code of that State, one rendering a willful violation or
omission of duty on the part of one in Campbell's position,
whereby human life or safety is endangered, punishable
as a misdemeanor; the other making willful or negligent
conduct which causes a collision of trains, and the resulting death of a human being, a criminal offense. 2 Idaho
Rev. Code, §§ 6926, 6909. Whether Campbell was or is
punishable criminally under either of these sections we
are not called upon to say. But his right to recover
against his employer depends upon the acts of Congress,
to which all state legislation affecting the subject-matter
must yield. Tex. & Pac. Ry. v. Rigsby, ante, pp. 33, 41.
Upon the whole case, we have no difficulty in sustaining his right of action under the Employers' Liability
Act. That Act (§ 1; 35 Stat. 65) imposes a liability for
injury to an employee "resulting in whole or in part from
the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of
such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due

241 U. S.

to its negligence in its cars, engines, appliances,
or other equipment." As was held in San Antonio &
Aransas Pass Ry. v. Wagner, decided June 5, 1916, ante,
p. 476, a violation of the Safety Appliance Act is "negligence" within the meaning of the Liability Act. And by
.the proviso to § 3 of the latter Act, no employee injured
or killed shall be held to have been guilty of contributory
.negligence in any case where a violation of the Safety
Appliance Act "contributed to the injury or death of such
employee." It is too plain for argument that under this
legislation the violation of the Safety Appliance Act
need not be the sole efficient cause, in order that an action
may lie. The Circuit Court of Appeals (217 Fed. Rep.
524) held that the element of proximate cause is eliminated
where concurring acts of the employer and employee' contribute to the injury or death of the employee. We agree
with this, except that we find it unnecessary to say the
effect of the statute is wholly to eliminate the question
of proximate cause. But where, as in this case, plaintiff's
contributory negligence and defendant's violation of a
provision of the Safety Appliance Act are concurring
proximate causes, it is plain that the Employers' Liability
Act requires the former to be disregarded.
The assignments of error that are based upon the instructions given and refused to be given to the jury raise
no question other than those which have been disposed of.
Judgment affirmed.
