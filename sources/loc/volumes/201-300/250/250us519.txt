AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

CENTRAL OF GEORGIA RAILWAY COMPANY v.
WRIGHT, COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE
STATE OF GEORGIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.

No. 30. Reargued October 13, 14, 1919.-Decided October 27, 1919.
The provisions in the charters granted in 1845 to the Southwestern
and Muscogee Railroads limiting their tax liabilities to a certain
per cent. of net income are to be construed like similar provisions
in the earlier charters of the Augusta & Waynesboro (1838) et al.
(Cf. s. c., 248 U. S. 525; Wright v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 236
U. S. 674) as extending to a lessee; there being no ground to hold
that the policy of the legislature had changed in the interim, although
provisions in the earlier charters affording express evidence that it
contemplated the income derived from letting as well as that from
using and sharing the railroads are absent from the later charters.
P. 523.
The policy remained the same when express power to let was given
in 1852. P. 524.
Merger of the Muscogee with the Southwestern under an act of 1856
did not affect the tax exemption. Id.
The court finds nothing in the later statutes or constitutions of Georgia
that attempts to supplant or impair the tax limitations in the charters of the Southwestern and Muscogee Railroads. Id.
146 Georgia, 406, reversed.

IN this case a rehearing was granted "in so far as the
validity of the tax in question is involved in or depends
upon the charters of the Southwestern and the Muscogee
Railroad and the subsequent relevant legislation." As to
all other questions, leave to file the application for rehearing was denied. 249 U. S. 590.
The judicial history of the charter tax exemptions is to
be found in the following cases: Central R. R. & Banking
Co. v. Macon (1871), 43 Georgia, 605; Central R. R. &
Banking Co. v. State (1874), 54 Georgia, 401; Southwestern
R. R. Co. v. State (1874), 54 Georgia, 401; CentralR. R. &
Banking Co. v. Georgia (1875), 92 U. S. 665; Southwestern
R. R. Co. v. Georgia (1875), 92U. S. 676; Wright v. Southwestern R. R. Co., 64 Georgia, 783; Southwestern R. R. Co.
v. Wright (1886), 116 U. S. 231; Central R. R. & Banking
Co. v. Wright (1896), 164 U. S. 327; Wright v. Central of
Georgia By. Co. (1915), 236 U. S. 674; Central of Georgia
Ry. Co. v. Wright (1919), 248 U. S. 525.
Mr. T. M. Cunningham, Jr., and Mr. A. R. Lawton for
plaintiff in error.
Mr. Warren Grice for defendant in error:
The original charters of the Southwestern and Muscogee
Railroads, unlike the charter of the Georgia R. R. & Banking Company, construed by this court in 236 U. S. 687,
and that of the Augusta and Waynesboro (afterwards
Augusta and Savannah), construed in the previous decision
of this case, 248 U. S. 525, contain no reference to a renting, lease or other disposition of the railroads beyond
operation by the grantee corporations. The tax immunity
was purely personal. It can not be said of either charter
that it "contemplated" or "permitted" any extension of
the tax contract to another. They fall, therefore, within
the general rule confining the immunity to the immediate
grantee in the absence of express words to the contrary,

and this distinction was fully recognized in Morris Canal
Co. v. Baird, 239 U. S. 132, and Rochester Ry. Co. v. Rochester, 205 U. S. 247.
The Act of January 22, 1852, Laws 1851-1852, p. 119,
authorized the Central R. R. & Banking Company to
lease certain connecting railroads, namely the Augusta
and Savannah and the Southwestern, and authorized them
to lease to the Central, for a term of years or during their
respective charters. This act did not include the Muscogee, which never connected with the Central. The Act of
1856, Laws 1856, p. 187, provided for the consolidation of
the Muscogee and the Southwestern companies under the
charter of the latter. Neither of these acts referred to
taxation or to immunity from taxation. The bare privilege to lease given was not acted on till June, 1869. If the
Act of 1852 had attempted to extend the exemption to the
lessee, it would be of importance to consider that in the
meanwhile the Georgia Code of 1863 had gone into effect
which made sweeping changes in the status of corporations
(see Atlantic & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Georgia,98 U. S. 359), and
the Constitution of 1868 had been adopted, making uniform ad valorem taxation the system of the State; and the
question would have been whether the Act of 1852, which
was a mere offer on the part of the State until acted on,
should not be considered as modified by all the subsequent
legislation affecting the subject of taxation. That there
was no contract till acceptance in 1869, see Southwestern
R. R. Co. v. State, 54 Georgia, 402; Buffalo Railroad Co. v.
Falconer, 103 U. S. 821. And that all the then body of
laws was part of the contract, see Great Northern Ry. Co.
v. Minnesota, 216 U. S. 206, and cases cited.
But the whole question is removed by noting that the
Act of 1852 makes no attempt to extend any immunity to
the lessee. And an immunity from taxing power never
arises from silence or by implication, but only from express
terms that admit of no other reasonable construction.

Yazoo & Mssissippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Adams, 180 U. S.
1, 22; Phenix Insurance Co. v. Tennessee, 161 U. S. 174;
Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, 161 U. S. 134, 146; Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Wright, 116 U. S. 231.
While the interest remaining in the lessor was still protected by the personal contract against taxation higher
than one-half per cent. on its net annual income, to wit,
the reserved rental on the road; the interest acquired by
the lessee remained, under the general law, liable to be
taxed as the property of the lessee. It is true that in 1869
there existed no law for the separate taxation of the leasehold interest in property, unless the provisions of the
Constitution of 1868 and the Code in requiring all property
to be taxed uniformly ad valorem, implied it. But that
fact did not fetter the legislature, or prevent the passage
of laws for its taxation. Jetton v. University of the South,
208 U. S. 500.
But the present plaintiff was organized in 1895 under the
general railroad incorporation law of 1892, Code 1911,
ยง 872 et seq., by those who purchased the property of the
Central R. R. & Banking Company, including the lease
of the Southwestern Railroad, at foreclosure, and took the
new lease, here in controversy, of the Southwestern and
Muscogee Railroads, made by the Southwestern Company,
in substitution for the old one. By the express terms of
its charter it took its existence and its right to run these
railroads "subject to Article 4 of the Constitution of the
State, and all the laws governing railroad companies at
the date hereof or that may hereafter come of force," etc.
That article established uniform ad valorem taxation of all
property, and forbade special immunities and exemptions.
The laws then in existence separately taxed all "interests
less than the fee" to the owners. This new charter is as
much a contract as any other, and the agreements in it in
favor of the State are as much to be enforced and respected
as those in favor of the corporation. Having thus agreed

Opinion of the Court.

to pay taxes according to the constitution and laws, and
been allowed existence on that express condition, the
corporation would be estopped to assert an exemption if
it had acquired one. It would be waived.
The statute under which the charter was granted, being
by an elementary principle part of the charter, also in
express terms excepted "any exemption from taxation,
either State, County or Municipal," doubly emphasizing
the State's insistence that no corporation formed under
it should exercise any such immunity. Rochester Ry. Co.
v. Rochester, 205 U. S. 254, 255; Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
Minnesota, 216 U. S.229.
The provision in question is not in the nature of a
commuted tax on property. But if it were, the general
principle confining the exemption to the grantee would be
applicable. Stearns v. Minnesota, 179 U. S. 255; Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Wright, 116 U. S. 231.
The right to lease was not an original right of the Southwestern and Muscogee Companies. It seems never to
have been given the Muscogee Company, since it was not
named or described in the Act of 1852. No extension of
the exemption of the lessor to the lessee as to its interest
acquired by the lease is to be implied from the mere permission to lease. Jetton v. University of the South, 208
U. S.501.
Taxing the lessee separately on its interest can not
result in double taxation.
Confusion of earnings waived the exemption. Railroad
Co. v. Maine, 96 U. S.499.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case it was decided at the last term that the
plaintiff in error, the railway company, was exempt from
liability to taxation as lessee of certain roads, 248 U. S.
525, as it had been decided a few terms earlier that it was
exempt from taxation upon the fee of the same roads.

Opinion of the Court.

250 U. S.

236 U. S. 674. A rehearing was granted on the question
whether the exemption thus adjudged to exist extends to
portions of the plaintiff in error's road let to it by the
Southwestern Railroad and the Muscogee Railroad, which
were assumed to be embraced in the decision but were not
specially discussed. The consideration of the court was
directed especially to the charter of the Augusta and
Waynesboro Rail Road granted in 1838 and having features characteristic of the conception of railroads then
entertained. 236 U. S. 678, 679. It is argued that the
charters of the other lessors just named, granted at a later
date, even when limiting the corporation's liability to taxation in similar words, should be construed in a different way.
The charters of the Southwestern and the Muscogee
Railroads were not granted until 1845, and while like the
earlier ones they provided that the said railway and its
appurtenances and all property therewith connected, or the
capital stock of the said Rail Road Company, should not be
subject to be taxed higher than one-half of one per cent.
upon its annual net income, they did not contain the provisions that showed the legislature in 1838 to contemplate
indifferently a revenue derived from using, from sharing,
or from letting the special privileges granted-provisions
that were of weight in the decision of the court.
But we are satisfied that between 1838 and 1845 there
had been no such change in the policy of Georgia as to require the same words to be given a different meaning at the
later date from that which we have decided that they had
at the former. Circumstances had not changed when
express power to let was given in 1852. The Muscogee
was merged in the Southwestern under an act of 1856, but
the exemption remained superior to legislative change.
Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Georgia, 92 U. S. 676. As remarked by Chief Justice Waite in a like suit between the
same parties, the language of the exempting clause is
somewhat unusual, and means the railroad specified in the

Syllabus.

charter and none other. Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Wright,
116 U. S. 231. But conversely it means that that road
shall be exempt while owned by this corporation whether
used or demised.
We see nothing in the later statutes or constitutions
that attempts to substitute a new contract or to impair the
obligation of the one originally made. Different opinions
were entertained on the main question which this rehearing does not reopen; but taking that as settled we cannot
believe that any real distinction can be made between the
charter of the Augusta and Waynesboro and those of the
Southwestern and Muscogee roads.
The decree of last term must stand and that of the state
court must be reversed.
Decree reversed.
