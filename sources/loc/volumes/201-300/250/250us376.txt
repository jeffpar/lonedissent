OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Argument for DeGanay.

250 U. S.

DEGANAY v. LEDERER, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 319.

Argued April 23, 1919.-Decided June 9, 1919.

Stocks and bonds issued by domestic corporations, and mortgages
secured on domestic real estate, were owned by an alien nonresident
but were in the hands of an agent in this country, empowered to sell,
assign and transfer any of them and to invest and reinvest the proceeds as it might deem best in the management of the business
affairs of the owner. Held, that the income was subject to tax under
the Income Tax Law of October 3, 1913, c. 16, ยง II, A, subdiv. 1,
38 Stat. 166, as income from "property owned . . . in the
United States by persons residing elsewhere." P. 380.
Bonds, mortgages and certificates of stock are ordinarily regarded as
"property"; and that term is presumed to have been used in the
statute with its ordinary sense, nothing to the contrary appearing.
Id.
It is well settled that such property may have a situs for taxation at a,
place other than the owner's domicile. P. 381.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. James Wilson Bayard for DeGanay:
Intangible personal property has its situs at the domicile of the owner and, in the absence of special statutory
provisions, is not subject to taxation elsewhere. Kirtland
v. Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491; State Tax on Foreign Held
Bonds, 15 Wall. 300; Tappan v. Merchants' National
Bank, 19 Wall. 490; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v.

Kentucky, 239 U. S. 103; Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co.
v. Louisville, 245 U. S. 54; Buck v. Beach, 206 U. S. 392.
There are no special words in this statute which indicate
the intent to reach any particular classes of property.

Argument for Lederer.

It would follow, therefore, that the words "property
owned in the United States" should be taken in their

ordinary legal meaning, and that they should not be
extended to include intangible property owned by an
alien not resident in the United States, because such intangible personal property, under the general rule we have
above quoted, has for its situs the domicile of that alien
nonresident. 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 230; id. 273. The provisions of the act should not be extended beyond the
clear import of its terms. Gould v. Gould, 245 U. S. 151.
See also the instructions of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue of August 12, 1914, 16 T. D., Int. Rev., 118,
and December 28, 1914, id. 305, following the above
opinions of the Attorney General, and the Revenue Acts
of September 8, 1916, ยง 1, 39 Stat. 756, and February 24,
1919, ยง 213 (c), 40 Stat. 1057, 1066.
The plaintiff is subject to taxation in the country of her
residence and the presumption is against a construction
which would result in double taxation.

W. C. Herron was on the brief, for Lederer:

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

The Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, ยง II, A, subdivision 1,
38 Stat. 166, provides:
"That there shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid
annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing
from all sources in the preceding calendar year to every
citizen of the United States, whether residing at home or
abroad, and to every person residing in the United States,
though not a citizen thereof, a tax of 1 per centum per
annum upon such income, except as hereinafter provided;
and a like tax shall be assessed, levied, collected, and
paid annually upon the entire net income from all property
owned and of every business, trade, or profession carried
on in the United States by persons residing elsewhere."
Under this statutory provision a question arose as to
the taxability of income from certain securities of Emily
R. DeGanay, a citizen and resident of France. The District Court of the United States for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania held the income from the securities taxable. 239 Fed. Rep. 568. The case is here upon certificate
from the Circuit Court of Appeals, from which it appears:
That Emily R. DeGanay is a citizen of France, and re-

sides in that country. That her father was an American
citizen domiciled in Pennsylvania, and died in 1885,
having devised one-fourth of his residuary estate, consisting of real property, to the Pennsylvania Company
for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities, in trust
to pay the net income thereof to her. She also inherited
from her father a large amount of personal property in
her own right free from any trust. This personal property is invested in stocks and bonds of corporations organized under laws of the United States and in bonds
and mortgages secured upon property in Pennsylvania.
Since 1885 the Pennsylvania Company has been acting
as her agent under power of attorney, and has invested
and reinvested her property, and has collected and remitted to her the net income therefrom. The certificates
of stocks, bonds and mortgages had been and were in
1913 in the Company's possession in its offices in Philadelphia. The Company made a return of the income
collected for the plaintiff for the year 1913 both from her
real estate, which is not in controversy here, and her net
income from corporate stocks and bonds and the bonds
and mortgages held by her in her own right. The tax was
paid under protest and recovery was sought by the proper
action.
The question certified is limited to the net income
collected by virtue of the power of attorney from the
personal property owned by the plaintiff in her own right.
The power of attorney, which is attached to the certificate, authorizes the agent:
"To sell, assign, transfer any stocks, bonds, loans, or
other securities now standing or that may hereafter stand
in my name on the books of any and all corporations,
national, state, municipal or private, to enter satisfaction upon the record of any indenture or mortgage now
or hereafter in my name, or to sell and assign the same
and to transfer policies of insurance, and the proceeds,

also any other moneys to invest and reinvest in such
securities as they may in their discretion deem safe and
judicious to hold for my account; to collect and receipt
for all interest and dividends, loans, stocks, or other
securities now or hereafter belonging to me, to endorse
checks payable to my order and to make or enter into any
agreement or agreements they may deem necessary and
best for my interest in the management of my business
and affairs, also to represent me and in my behalf, to
vote and act for me at all meetings connected with any
company in which I may own stocks or bonds or be
interested in any way whatever, with power also as
attorney or attorneys under it for that purpose to make
and substitute, and to do all lawful acts requisite for
effecting the premises, hereby ratifying and confirming
all that the said attorney or substitute or substitutes
shall do therein by virtue of these presents."
The question certified is: "If an alien non-resident own
stocks, bonds, and mortgages secured upon property in
the United States or payable by persons or corporations
there domiciled; and if the income therefrom is collected
for and remitted to such non-resident by an agent domiciled in the United States; and if the agent has physical
possession of the certificates of stock, the bonds and the
mortgages; is such income subject to an income tax under
the Act of October 3d, 1913?"
The question submitted comes to this: Is the income
from the stock, bonds and mortgages, held by the Pennsylvania Company, derived from property owned in the
United States? A learned argument is made to the effect
that the stock certificates, bonds and mortgages are not
property, that they are but evidences of the ownership
of interests which are property; that the property, in a
legal sense, represented by the securities, would exist if
the physical evidences thereof were destroyed. But we
are of opinion that these refinements are not decisive of

Opinion of the Court.

the congressional intent in using the term "property" in
this statute. Unless the contrary appears, statutory words
are presumed to be used in their ordinary and usual sense,
and with the meaning commonly attributable to them.
To the general understanding and with the common
meaning usually attached to such descriptive terms, bonds,
mortgages, and certificates of stock are regarded as property. By state and federal statutes they are often treated
as property, not as mere evidences of the interest which
they represent. In Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189,
206, this court held that a deposit by a citizen of Illinois
in a trust company in the City of New York was subject
to the transfer tax of the State or New York and said:
"There is no conflict between our views and the point
decided in the case reported under the name of State Tax
on Foreign Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300. The taxation in
that case was on the interest on bonds held out of the
State. Bonds and negotiable instruments are more than
merely evidences of debt. The debt is inseparable from
the paper which declares and constitutes it, by a tradition
which comes down from more archaic conditions. Bacon
v. Hooker, 177 Massachusetts, 335, 337."
The Court of Appeals of New York, recognizing the
same principle, treated such instruments as property in
People ex. rel. Jefferson v. Smith, 88 N. Y. 576, 585:
"It is clear from the statutes referred to and the authorities cited and from the understanding of business men in
commercial transactions, as well as of jurists and legislators, that mortgages, bonds, bills and notes have for
many purposes come to be regarded as property and not
as the mere evidences of debts, and that they may thus
have a situs at the place where they are found like other
visible, tangible chattels."
We have no doubt that the securities, herein involved,
are property. Are they property within the United States?
It is insisted that the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam

applies in this instance, and that the situs of the property
was at the domicile of the owner in France. But this
court has frequently declared that the maxim, a fiction
at most, must yield to the facts and circumstances of
cases which require it; and that notes, bonds and mortgages may acquire a situs at a place other than the domicile of the owner, and be there reached by the taxing
authority. It is only necessary to refer to some of the
decisions of this court. New Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U.
S. 309; Bristol v. Washington County, 177 U. S. 133;
Blackstone v. Miller, supra; State Board of Assessors v.
Comptoir National d'Escompte, 191 U. S. 388; Carstairs
v. Cochran, 193 U. S. 10; Scottish Union & National Ins.
Co. v. Bowland, 196 U. S. 611; Wheeler v. New York, 233
U. S. 434, 439; Iowa v. Slimmer, 248 U. S. 115, 120.
Shares of stock in national banks, this court has held, for
the purpose of taxation may be separated from the domicile of the owner, and taxed at the place where held.
Tappanv. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall. 490.
In the case under consideration the stocks and bonds
were those of corporations organized under the laws
of the United States, and the bonds and mortgages were
secured upon property in Pennsylvania. The certificates
of stock, the bonds and mortgages were in the Pennsylvania Company's offices in Philadelphia. Not only is
this so, but the stocks, bonds and mortgages were held
under a power of attorney which gave authority to the
agent to sell, assign, or transfer any of them, and to invest
and reinvest the proceeds of such sales as it might deem
best in the management of the business and affairs of the
principal. It is difficult to conceive how property could
be more completely localized in the United States. There
can be no question of the power of Congress to tax the
income from such securities. Thus situated and held, and
with the authority given to the local agent over them,
we think the income derived is clearly from property
