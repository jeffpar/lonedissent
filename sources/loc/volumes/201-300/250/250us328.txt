v. Portland& Kennebec R. R. Co., 94 U. S. 806, 811. Between 1892 and 1905 plaintiff did nothing to enforce his
alleged rights except to commence in 1893 a suit which
he did not prosecute. His lack of diligence is wholly
unexcused; and both the nature of the claim and the
situation of the parties was such as to call for diligence.

UNITED STATES v. BABCOCK.
UNITED STATES v. HAYDEN.
APPEALS FROM TRY, COURT OF CLAIMS.
Nos. 708, 915. Argued April 15, 1919.-Decided June 2, 1919.
The Act of March 3, 1885, c. 335, 23 Stat. 350, authorizing payment,
after examination and determination by the accounting officers of
the Treasury, of claims for property belonging to officers and enlisted men and lost or destroyed in the military service under certain
circumstances, provides "that any claim which shall be presented
and acted on under authority of this act shall be held as finally
determined, and shall never thereafter be reopened or considered."
Held, that this proviso clearly confers exclusive and final jurisdiction on the Treasury Department, so that claims under the act are
not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. P. 331. United
States v. Laughlin, 249 U. S. 440, distinguished.
Under the Acts of January 9, 1883, c. 15, 22 Stat. 401, and August 13,
1888, c. 868, 25 Stat. 437, the right to present claims for the loss,
etc., of horses in the military service, under ยง 3482, Rev. Stats.,
as amended by the Act of June 22, 1874, c. 395, 18 Stat. 193, expired

delivered the opinion of the

court.
These cases, which were argued together, are appeals
by the United States from judgments entered in the
Court of Claims. In each an officer in the army recovered
compensation under the Act of March 3, 1885, c. 335,
23 Stat. 350, for the loss, while in the service, without
fault or negligence on his part, of privately owned personal property. In each case the claim had been duly
presented within two years of the occurrence of the loss,
and the Secretary of War had decided that the articles
in question were "reasonable, useful, necessary, and
proper for" such officer "while in quarters, engaged in
the public service, in line of duty."
In the Babcock case the horse of a captain stationed at
the Presidio died in 1910 of strangulation because the
Government furnished as the forage ration barley with
the awns on it. In the Hayden case, a lieutenant stationed at Texas City, Texas, lost in 1915 his personal
effects during a hurricane and inundation, while he was
endeavoring to save the property of the Government and
of others as well as his own. The claim for the horse had
been disallowed by the Auditor of the War Department
on the ground that "the death of officer's horse was not
caused by any exigency of the service, nor from a cause
incident to or produced by the military service." He had
disallowed the claim for the personal effects because "the

property was not lost or destroyed by being shipped on an
unseaworthy vessel, nor by reason of the claimant giving
his attention to saving property belonging to the United
States"; and the Auditor's decision was affirmed on appeal
by the Comptroller of the Treasury. The Auditor made
no finding as to the value of the property lost. This was
fixed by the Court of Claims at $200 for the horse and
$333 for the personal effects; and for these amounts it
entered judgments on the authority of Newcomber v.
United States, 51 Ct. Clms. 408, and Andrews v. United
States, 52 Ct. Clms. 373. The loss in each case occurred
prior to April 5, 1917, so that the rights of the parties are
not affected by the provisions of the Act of March 28,
1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 459, 479-480; or Chapter VI of the
Act of July 9, 1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 845, 880-1.
The questions whether the Act of March 3, 1885,
authorizes recovery for horses under any circumstances
and under what circumstances it authorizes recovery
for other personal property have long been the subject
of controversy in the Auditing Department and in that
of the Comptroller of the Treasury. See 20 Decisions of
the Comptroller, 238. But here we are confronted with
the preliminary enquiry: Has Congress conferred upon
the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine in any case
whether recovery may be had under that statute for an
article lost or destroyed? The right asserted is based
upon the provision which declares, "That the proper
accounting officers of the Treasury be, and they are
hereby, authorized and directed to examine into, ascertain, and determine the value of the private property
belonging to officers and enlisted men in the military
service of the United States which has been, or may hereafter be, lost or destroyed in the military service, under
the following circumstances:

.

.

.", and that "the

amount of such loss so ascertained and determined shall
be paid out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise

appropriated, and shall be in full for all such loss or
damage."
These general rules are well settled: (1) That the United
States, when it creates rights in individuals against
itself, is under no obligation to provide a remedy through
the courts. United States ex rel. Dunlap v. Black, 128
U. S. 40; Ex parte Atocha, 17 Wall. 439; Gordon v. United
States, 7 Wall. 188, 195; DeGrootv. United States, 5 Wall.
419, 431-433; Comegys v. Vasse, 1 Pet. 193, 212. (2)
That where a statute creates a right and provides a
special remedy, that remedy is exclusive. Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn ProductsRefining Co., 236 U. S. 165,
174-175; Arnson v. Murphy, 109 U. S. 238; Barnet v.
National Bank, 98 U. S.555, 558; Farmers' & Mechanics'
National Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S.29, 35. Still the fact
that the right and the remedy are thus intertwined might
not, if the provision stood alone, require us to hold that
the remedy expressly given excludes a right of review by
the Court of Claims, where the decision of the special
tribunal involved no disputed question of fact and the
denial of compensation was rested wholly upon the construction of the act. See Medbury v. United States, 173
U. S.492, 498; Parish v. MacVeagh, 214 U. S. 124; McLean v. United States, 226 U. S. 374; United States v.
Laughlin, 249 U. S. 440. But here Congress has provided, "That any claim which shall be presented and
acted on under authority of this act shall be held as
finally determined, and shall never thereafter be reopened
or considered." These words express clearly the intention to confer upon the Treasury Department exclusive
jurisdiction and to make its decision final. The case of
United States v. Harmon, 147 U. S.268, strongly relied
upon by claimants, has no application. Compare D. M.
Ferry & Co. v. United States, 85 Fed. Rep. 550, 557.
In the Babcock case claimant insists also that ยง 3482
of the Revised Statutes, as amended by Act of June 22,

1874, c. 395, 18 Stat. 193, affords a basis for the recovery.
That section provided for reimbursement for horses lost
in the military service, among other things "in consequence of the United States failing to supply sufficient
forage." The 1874 amendment provided for reimbursement in any case "where the loss resulted from any exigency or necessity of the military service, unless it was
caused by the fault or negligence of such officers or enlisted men." Even if these statutes were applicable to
facts like those presented here, there could be no recovery; because under the Acts of January 9, 1883, c. 15,
22 Stat. 401, and August 13, 1888, c. 868, 25 Stat. 437,
the right to present claims under ยง 3482 of the Revised
Statutes as amended finally expired in 1891. See Griffis
v. United States, 52 Ct. Clms. 1, 170.
The Court of Claims was without jurisdiction in either
case, and the judgments are

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY ET
AL. v. PUGET SOUND & WILLAPA HARBOR
RAILWAY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON.
No. 327.

Argued April 28, 1919.-Decided June 2, 1919.

A railroad company by constructing its road gains no vested right to
the retention of a general rule of law, then in existence, laying the expense of installing and maintaining required safety devices, where one
railroad exercises its right to cross another, upon the company making the crossing; and it is not deprived of its property without due
process by a change of the rule under which it is required to share
such expense equally with a junior company. P. 335.
94 Washington, 10; 97 id. 701, affirmed.
