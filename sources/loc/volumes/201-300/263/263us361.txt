KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON, v. SEATTLE
SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT .OF APPEALS. FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
.No. 30.

Argued April 13, 1923-Decided December 3, 1923.

1. A suit is within the jurisdiction of the District Court as a controversy arising'under the laws of the United 'States, Jud. Code,
§ 24, where the right- and title set up by the plaintiff depend
upon the construction of an act of Congress: P. 363.
2. The Act of Congress of May 23, 1908, directing that 25% of all
money received from each forest reserve shall be paid to the State
in which the reserve is situated, "to be extended as the State
...
legislature may prescribe for the benefit of the public
schools and public roads of the county or counties in which the
forest reserve is situated," does- not create a trust, but results in
a sacred obligation imposed on the public faith of the donee State.
P. 364.
3. The act does not prescribe how the moneys shall be divided as
between the two purposes named, but leaves this to the State. Id.
4. Where a state law authorizes and directs county commissioners
to expend the moneys received by their county, 'under te above
act of Congress, for the benefit of the public schools and public
roads thereof, a school district has no standing to call a county to
account when more of the funds are used for the one than for the
other purpose, since equal division between the two is not contemplated or required by the act, and the rule that a grant to
several, without specification of interests, conveys equal interests,
does not apply. P. 365.

accounting.
Mr. Howard A. Hanson, with whom Mr. Malcolm
Douglas was on the briefs, for appellant.
Mr. Henry W. Pennock, with whom Mr. Dallas V.
Halverstadt was on the brief, for appellee.
MB. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Act of Congress of May 23, 1908, c. 192, 35 Stat.
260,1 directs that twenty-five per cent. of all money received from each forest reserve during any fiscal year
shall be paid at the end thereof by the Secretary of the
Treasury to the State in which the reserve is situated
"to be expended as the State
.
legislature 'may
*prescribe for the benefit of the public schools and public
roads of the county or counties in which the forest reserve
is situated," and it is provided that when any forest reserve is in more than one State or Territory or coufilty
the distributive share to'each from the proceeds of said reserve shall be proportional to its area therein. A statute
of Washington (Laws of 1907, c. 185, p. 406) directs-the
state treasurer to turn over to the county treasurers the
amounts of such money belonging to the respective counties; and provides that "county commissioners of the
respective counties to which the money is distributed are
hereby authorized and directed to expend said money
for the benefit. of the public schools and public roads
*thereof,-and not otherwise."
The Secretary of the Treasury paid over to the State
the proper amounts for the years from 1908 to 1918,
inclusive. A part of the Snoqualmie Forest Reserve is
in King County, and the proportionate amounts for these

years, aggregating $20,106.07, were turned over by the
State to the county treasurer. For each of the years,
1908, 1916, 1917, and 1918, the county commissioners
directed that one-half of the amount be apportioned to
the county school fund and one-half to the road and
bridge fund; and for each of the years from 1909 to
1915, inclusive, directed that all be assigned to the road
and bridge fund. The county treasurer made' the distributions as directed. Out of the total amount above
mentioned, there was assigned $18,481.43 to the road and
bridge fund and $1,624.64 to the county school fund. The
latter is $8,428.40 less than one-half the total received
by the county. The appellee is one of the school districts
,of the county and claims to be entitled to such proportion
of one-half the amount received in each year by the
county as the annual school attendance in the district
bore to the total attendance in all the districts of the
county. The amounts so claimed make a total of $6,789.22.
This suit was brought by the appellee, Seattle School
District No. 1, to have King County and its treasurer
declared to be trustees, to require" them to account, and
to recover the sum so claimed. The complaint set forth
the facts substantially as above stated. The county moved
to dismiss on the grounds that the court was without
jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a cause
of action. The motion was denied, and, the appellant
declining to plead further, a decree was entered in favor
of the appellee as prayed; this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Section 24 of the Judicial Code provides that the district courts shall have -original jurisdiction where the
matter in controversy arises under the laws of the United
States. In this case the right and title set up by the appellee depends upon the act of Congress. There is involved the question whether that act permits the money
so received by the county to be expended by the county

commissioners as directed by state legislation, or requires
an equal distribution annually for the benefit of public
schoolg and public roads of the county. Appellee contended for the latter construction, and the courts below
sustained its claim. If this is not a correct construction
of the act appellee has no cause of action. See Northern
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U. S. 526, "528; Shulthis
v. McDougal,225 U. S. 561, 569. The District Court had
jurisdiction.
When turned over to the State, the money belongs to
it absolutely. There is no limitation upon the power of
the legislature-to prescribe how the expenditures shall
be made for the purposes stated, though, by the act of
Congress, "there is a sacred obligation imposed on its
public faith.". Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 182;
Alabama v. Schmidt, 232 U. S. 168, 173; Mills County v.
Railroad Companies, 107 U. S. 557, 566; Hagarv. Recla•mation District, 111 U. S. 701, 713. No trust for the
benefit of appellee is created by the grant. But, assumimg the moneys paid over to the State are charged with
a trust that there shall be expended annually one-half
for schools and one-half for roads, the appellee has no
right to enforce the trust. Congress alone can inquire
into the manner of its execution by the State. United
States v. Louisiana, 127 U. S. 182, 185-192; Mills County
v. Railroad Companies, sitpra; Emigrant Co. v. County
of Adams, 100 U. S. 61, 69; Barrett v. Brooks, 21 Ia. 144,
148. See also Stearns v. Minnesota, 179 U. S. 223, 231.
The act does not direct any. division of the money between schools and roads. Its language above quoted indicates an intention on the part of Congress that the
State in its discretiofi may prescribe by legislation how
the money is to be expended. No distribution to the appellee or any other school district is required. The public
schools and public roads are provided and maintained by
'the State or its subdivisions, and the moneys granted by

the United States are assets in fhe hands of the State
to be used for the, specified purposes as it deems best.
See State v. Callvert, 34 Wash. 58, 61.
The rule that, where a grant to two or more persons
does not state the interest of each, their estates are presumed to be equal,2 does not apply. Under the act of
Congress, it was competent for the legislature of Washington to authorize county commissioners to expend the
money for public schools and public roads. Equal division
-annually between the two purposes is not required or
contemplated by the act. The appellee has no standing
to object to the distributions made by the county commissioners.
