Opinioik of the Court.

STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA v. STATE OF
MINNESOTA.
IN EQUITY.

No. 10, Original.

Instruction to the Clerk.-Opinion rendered
January 21, 1924.

In an original suit between States, the practice has been to divide
the costs between the parties where the matter was a governmental
question in which each had a real, yet not a litigious, interest; but
where the proceeding is clearly litigious, 6onducted on behalf and,
apparently, at the expense of private individuals, the costs should
be adjudged against the defeated plaintiff.
Costs taxed against plaintiff. See ante, p. 365.

MR. CHRF JUSTICE TAFT

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Clerk has asked instruction concerning the taxation
of costs.
By far the greater number of suits between States have
been brought for. the purpose of settling boundaries.' In
the first, Rhode Island y. Massachusetts,4 How. 591, 639,
the bill was dismissed. There was no provision as to costs
in the decree and the record of fees is not available. In

Opinion of the Court.

263 U. S.

Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 -Wall. 395, the bill was dismissed~with costs, from which we infer that the defeated
party paid them. In the remaining thirteen the costs were
equally divided.
In Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S.. 359, 370, Mr. Justice
Brewer, speaking for the Court, said: "The costs of this
suit will be divided between the two States, because the
matter involved is one of those governmental qijestions in
"which eacha party has a real and vital, and ,et not a
'litigious, interest." And in Maryland v. West Virginia,
217 U. S. 577, 582, Mr. Justice Day delivering the opinion'
of the Court, said:
".The matter involved is governmental in character, in
which each party has a real and yet not a litigious interest.
The object to be obtained is the settlement of a boundary
line between sovereign States in the interest, not only of
property rights, but also in the promotion of the peace
and good order- of the dommunities, and is one .which the
States have a common interest to bring to a satisfactory
and final conclusion. Where such is the nature of the
cause we think the expenses should be borne in common,
so far as may be, and we therefore adopt somuch of the
.decree proposed by the State of Maryland as makes provision for the cost of the surveys made under the order of
this court."
The same rule; however, does not apply to cases in
'which the parties have a litigious interest. In New Hampshire v. Louisiana and New York v. Louisiana, 108 U. S.
76; 91, the complainant States brought suits upon bonds
of Louisiana assigned to them by their citizens for the purpose of avoiding the inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment. The suits were dismissed with costs adutged
against the complainants.
In South Dakota v. North Carolina,192 U. S. 286, 321,'
the suit was onbonds of North Carolina donated by the
original purchasers t? South Dakota and there was judg-

ment for South Dakota for the amournt due with costs of
suit.
In Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S.496, 526, which was a
bill to restrain Illinois and her subordinate agency, the
Chicago Sanitary District, from discharging sewage into
the Mississippi and exposing the people of Missouri to
danger of typhoid fever from germs in their drinking
water, the bill was dismissed without prejudice but the
costs were adjudged against the complainant State.
In New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S.296, 313, the bill
sought to restrain the pollution of the harbor of New York.
The bill was dismissed without prejudice, but the coats
were adjudged against New York.
In Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S.46, 117, the suit was
brought to enjoin diversion of flowing water. Apparently the Court regarded the issue as a non-litigious one
the settlement of which would be useful to both States
and, following the boundary cases, divided the costs. In
Wyoming v. Colorado,259 U. S.496; 260 U. S.1, 3, where
the issue was similar, the costs were adjudged one-third to
Wyoming, one-third to Colorado, and one-third to two
corporate defendants at whose expense the case had been
defended by Colorado.
The present proceeding is clearly a litigious one. The
persons whose lands were overflowed raised a fund to
conduct the litigation. The bill of North Dakota asked
for a decree of injunction with $5,000 for damages to
state property and 81,000,000 for damages to residents
of North Dakota with the purpose, presumably, of distributing the latter sum to injuredreSidents, contributors
to the fund. The exact agreement as to the use of the
funds thus raised does not appear in the record. When
the State Engineer of North Dakota;.-Mr. Ralph, the
chief witness for the State, 7ws cross-examined in respect
to it, he refused to answer by advice of counsel for North
Dakota.- The natural inference is that the fund was being

used in the conduct of the litigation. We think that the
circumstances put this case in the category with New
Hampshire v. Louisiana, Missouri v. Illinois, and New
York v. New Jersey, and that the costs should be taxed
