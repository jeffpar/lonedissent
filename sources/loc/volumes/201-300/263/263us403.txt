NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WINDOW. GLASS
MANUFACTURERS ET AL. v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.

No. 353. Argued November 22, 23, 1923.-Decided December 10,
1923.
1. Whether an agreement between all the manufacturers of a commodity and a union representing all the labor obtainable for its
manufacture, violates the Sherman Law, when it concerns only
the way in which the labor shall be employed in production, and
not sales or distribution, depends upon the particular facts. P. 411.
2. The manufacturers of hand-blown window glass,-an article costing twice as much to produce, but sold at the same price, as
window glass made with the aid of machines, the price of the
latter necessarily fixing the price of the former,-finding the
supply of workmen in their industry insufficient to run their
factories continuously during-the working season, and being unable
to run undermanned without serious loss, made an arrangement
with the workmen, through their union, whereby, in effect, all the
available labor was apportioned to part of the factories for part
of the season and to the others for the remainder, so that all the
workmen were secured the advantage of continuous employment
through all the season, and each factory secured its share of labor
for one period and closed down during the other. Held, not a
combination in unreasonable restraint of trade, assuming that it
might affect interstate commerce. P. 412.

Mr. Solicitor General Beck, with whom Mr. Robert P.
'Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on
the brief, for the United States.
I. The restraint is for an unlawful purpose. No more
complete or indefensible monopoly was ever established
in any anti-trust case. It controls. substantially all of
the hand-blown glass industry-a necessary material in
the building industry.
The exigencies of the war required the Government to
make a partial restriction in the production 6f glass, but
when the war had ended the exigency passed. Unfortunately in that period of restriction both manufacturers
and the employees in this industry temporarily realized
the advantages to them of limiting production. On the
one hand, the manufacturers found that if production
could be restricted below the demand of the public, the
question of price was in their control and, thus basing
an artificial price upon an artificial scarcity, they believed
that they -could make more money on a lessened production than if they met the demands of the market.
Similarly, those who controlled the glass workers' union
erroneously believed that a compulsory restriction of production would increase the demand for the product and
therefore the wages of labor. To centralize power, the.
constitution of the union was interpreted as a virtual
power of attorney to the wage committee to act as it
pleased, without respect to the wishes of the members
of the union. NQ other committee or officer had any
authority in the matter, except that, after the wage agree-

263 U. S.

ment was made, the executive board applied it to each
manufacturer by allotting to him the first or second
period, or both, if he were willing to operate two distinct
plants. Even a referendum to the members of the union
was powerless to overrule the arbitrary action of the wage
committee.
II. The restraint has been imposed against the wishes
of many of the manufacturers and of a large majority of
the workers.
Both employer and employee were denied any freedom
of action. No free labor market existed. The union had
surrounded the industry with a wall, that no one could
surmount. No manufacturer could operate without the
consent of the union. The whole industry, employer and
employee alike, only existed by the sufferance of a wage
committee.
If it be true, as is claimed, that this alleged "dying
industry" can not survive without the restrictions in
question, then it is intolerable that the public should pay
on capital expenditure for a whole year and only get in
return-a very -restricted production of eighteen weeks.
Such. a proposition is economically indefensible. That
suph is not the case is clearly indicated by the fact that,
until the industry was put on half-time during the war,
it not only survived but, measured by the number of employees, was growing.
The -testimony shows that hand-made glass is better
.in quality than machine glass, and presumably there will
always be a market for the better quality. It is, *however, unnecessary to theorize on this subject. The law
of competition requires that the ability of any industry
to survive should be put to the practical and unrestricted
test.
The Government made little of the question of prices,
for another indefensible featur6 of this monopoly was that
there was no competition even in sales. The testimony

WINDOW GLASS MFRS. v. U. S.
403

Argument for the United States.

of the manufacturers themselves was that, having originally pooled their sales through a common selling agency,.
they subsequently and apparently by concerted action
sold at the price fixed by the leading factory in the machine glass industry. Thus there was as little competition in selling price as there was in production.
III. The existing deficiency in the labor supply is not
natural but is due to restrictions imposed upon those who
wish to work in the industry. The record discloses that
the great reduction in the number of workers has occurred
since the installation of the two-period system and that
a large majority of the members of the union are opposed
to that system. "
The shortage of labor was also due to the restrictions
upon the manufacturers in the securing of the necessary
workers.
IV. The plan restrains interstate commerce. The actions of this union, in agreeing or refusing to agree with
separate manufacturrs were steps in the execution of
an illegal plan upon which there had been an earlier agreement or understanding between the manufacturers' association and the union. The manufacturers' association
comprised the major portion of the manufacturers of
hand-blown window glass, and controlled all, and theunion comprised substantially all of the workers in the
industry. It was alleged and proved that a large portion
of the glass manufactured was shipped in interstate commerce, that dealers in the glass were not able to fill all
of their orders for interstate shipment, and that interstate
commerce was very materially restrained by the severe
time limits which were imposed by virtue of the agreement between the manufacturers' association and the
union. The restraint was not merely minor and incidental, but great and intentional. Distinguishing: United"

United States v. American Oil Co., 262 U. S. 371.
V. The Clayton Act does not exempt the agreements
involved from the anti-trust laws. United Mine Workers
v. CoronadoCo., 259 U. S. 344.
Just as this Court has held that, while owners of patents and copyrights possess special privileges, they cannot go beyond those privileges and limit resale prices
without violating the Anti-Trust Act (StandardSanitary
Co. v. United States, 226 U. S. 20; see also Miles Medical
Co. v-. Park & Sons C&., 220 U. S. 273; Boston Store v.
American Graphophone Co., 246 U. S. 8), so, also, it has
held that, while workers may organize to attain the normal
and "legitimate" objects of a labor organization, they
may not so extend the activities protected under § 6 of the
Clayton Act as to defeat the general purposes of the antitrust laws. Duplex Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443.
. The Government does not contend that the National
Window Glass Workers is in itself an illegal combination.
It challenges simply one provision of the agreement or
understanding between the union and the National Association of Window Glass Manufacturers, and the subsequent proceedings in execution of that portion of the
agreement.
VI. The intentions of the defendants when thus restraining interstate commerce are immaterial. Addyston

blown window glass in the United States is required to

industry, no matter how eager he may be to manufacture
or how earnestly the men in his plant may wish to continue in his employ. Addyston Co. v. United States, 175

I. The wage scale under attack has not curtailed or in
any way lessened the production of hand-blown window
glass, and has, therefore, not restrained trade. Nash v.
United States, 229 U. S. 373.

and necessary regulation; it is the legitimate outgrowth
of the peculiar business conditions confronting the industry. United States v. Reardon, 191 Fed. 454; 6 R. C. L.

IV. The right to negotiate a,wage scale is one of the
rights guaranteed to a labor union by § 6 of the Clayton
Act. The chief function of a labor union is the fixing of a
wage scale covering periods of labor and wages. If the
fixing of this scale is deemed a restraint of commerce, the
right of labor to form and operate the labor union becomes an empty right, and § 6 of the Clayton Act is in
effect vitiated and the benefits conferred by the act taken
away. Carew v. Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1; United States

MR. JUSTICE HOLMEs delivered, the opinion of the
Court.
This is a proceeding brought by the United States under
the Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, § 4; 26 Stat. 209, to prevent
an alleged violation of § 1, which forbids combinations
in restraint of trade among the States. The defendants
are all the manufacturers of handblown window glass,
with certain of their officers, and the National Window
Glass Workers, a voluntary association, its officers and
members, embracing all the labor to be had for this work
in the United States. The defendants established a wage
scale to be in effect from September 25, 1922, to January
27, 1923, and from January 29, 1923, to June- 11, 1923;
and the feature that is the object of the present attack
is that this scale would be issued to one set of factories
for the first period and to another for the second, but that
no factory could get it for both, and without it they could
not get labor and therefore must stop work. After a
hearing a final decree was entered enjoining the defendants from carrying out the above or any similar agreements so far as they might limit and 'prescribe the time
during which the defendant manufacturers should operate
their factories for handblown window glass. 287 Fed. 228.
This agreement does not concern sales or distribution,
it is directed only to the way in which union labor, the
only labor obtainable it is true, shall be employed inproduction. If such an agreement can be within the Sherman Act at least it is not necessarily so. United Mine
Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344,
408. To determine-its legality requires a consideration

412

263 U. S.

of the particular facts. Board of Trade of Chicago v.
United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238.
The dominant fact in this case is that in the last quarter
of a century machines have been brought into use that
dispense. with the employment of the highly trained blowers and the trained gatherers needed for the handmade
glass and in that and other ways have eiabled the factories using machines to produce window glass at half the
cost of the handmade. The price for the two kinds is
the same. It -has followed of course that the companies
using machines- fix the price, that they make much the
greater part of the glass in the market, and probably, as
was testified for the defendaiits, that the handmakers are
able to keep on only by the sufferance of the others and
by working longer hours. The defendants say, and it is
altogether likely, that the conditions thus brought about
and the nature of tile work have driven many laborers
away and made it impossible. to get new ones. For the
work is very trying, requires considerable training, and
is always liable to a reduction of wages if the machine
industry lowers the price. The only chance for the handwbrkers has been when and where they could get cheap
fuel and therefore their. tendency has been to follow the
discoveries of natural gas.. The defendants contend with
a good deal of force that it is absurd to speak of their
arrangements as possibly having any effect upon commerce among the States, when manufacturers of this kind
obviously are not able to do more than struggle to survive
a little longer before they disappear, as human effort
always disappears when it is not needed to direct the force
that can be got more cheaply from water or coal.
.,But that is not all of the defendants' case. There are
nottwenty-five hundred men dt present in the industry.
The \Government says that this is the fault of the union;
the defendants with much greater probability that it is
the inevitable coming to pass. But wherever the fault, if

ROOKER v. FIDELITY TRUST CO.

Syllabus.

there is any, that is the fact with which the defendants
had to deal. There were not men enough to enable the
factories to run continuously during the working season,
leaving out the two or three summer months in which the.
heat makes it impossible to go on. To work undermanned costs the same in fuel and overhead expenses as.
to work fully manned, and therefore means a serious loss.
On the other hand the men are less well off with the uncertainties that such a situation brings. The purpose of
the arrangement is to secure employment for all the men
during the whole of the two seasons, thus to give all the
labor available to the factories, and to divide it equally
among them. From'the view that we take we think it
unnecessary to explain how the present system sprang
from experience during the war when the Government
restricted production to one-half of what it had been and
an accident was found to work well, or to do more than
advert to the defendants' contention that with the means
available the production is increased. It is enough that
we see no combination in unreasonable restraint of trade
in the arrangements made to meet the short supply of

men.
