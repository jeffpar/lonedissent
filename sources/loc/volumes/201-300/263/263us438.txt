APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI, TRANSFERRED
FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
Nos. 167 and 168. Motions to dismiss and to remand submittedOctober:- 8, 1923:-Decided January 7, 1924.
1. A case in which the jurisdiction of the District Court was. invoked
by the plaintiff upon the sole ground of a constitutional question,
is appealable to this Court exclusively (Jud. Code, §.238); and the
presence of other questions, that are not federal questions adequate
in themselves to support the original jurisdiction, can afford nQ
ground for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 440.
2. Where a final decree of the District Court which is reviewable
only by direct appeal to this Court has been erroneously talken to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, it cannot be transferred to this
Court under the Act of September 14, 1922, Jud. Cod&, § 238a,
if the time (3 months) allowed for direct appeal here from the
District Court had expired when the appeal to the Circuit Court
of Appeals was taken. P. 442.

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE 'TAFT delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These were two bills in equity in the United States
District Court brought by citizens of Missouri to enjoin
citizens of the same State from proceeding to collect spe7cial assessments, of the necessary jurisdictional amount
in each case, against complainants' lands in Kansas City
for a public improvement, on'the ground that the city
charter and laws under which the assessments were levied
were in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of th6
Federal Constitution. This was the only basis for the
jurisdiction of the District Court. The bills also averred
that the assessments did not comply with the laws under
which they purported to be levied. The defendants in
their answers, in addition to a denial of the averments
upon which the. relief was asked, pleaded a former adjudication of the same causes of action in a MKsouri
State Court.
The District Court. held with the' complainants that
the charter and laws as carried out in levying the assessments violated the Fourteenth Amendment, overruled
the plea of res judicata and granted the injunction as
prayed. Appeals were perfected, to the Circuit Court
of Appeals. The appellees moved 'to dismiss the appeals.
They contended that the jurisdiction of the appeals was
exclusively in this Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed with them in this, but declined to dismiss the

appdals because of an Act of Congress approvel September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837, amending § 238 Jud.
Code, by adding a new § 238a, in part as follows:
"If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be
taken to, or issued out of, any circuit court of appeals
in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should
have been taken to or issued out of the Supreme Court;
. . . such appeal. or writ of error shall not for such reason
be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper cofirt,
which shall thereupon be possessed of the same and shall
proceed to the determination thereof, with the same force
and effect as if such appeal or writ of error had been
duly taken to, or issued out of, the court to which it is
so transferred."
An order was accordingly. made transferring the
appeals to this Court. The final decrees of the District
Court were entered of record July 7, 1921. The three
months in which an appeal could have been taken from
that court to this expired on the following October 7
(39 Stat. 727, c. 448, § 6). The appeals to the Circuit
Court of Appeals were allowed January 4, 1922,
The appellants move to remand the appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals with direction to consider them on
their merits. The appellees insist that the new § 238a,
does not apply to the appeals, that they were improperly
transferred, and should be remanded with instructions
to dismiss.
Two questions are thus presented for our decision:
1st, Did the Circuit Court of Appeals have jurisdiction
of the appeals?
2nd, If not, shQuld it have dismissed them instead of
transferring them to this Court?
First. The Circuit Courts of Appeals were created by
the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826. The
division of the appellate business between fhe new courts
and this Court was oiginally provided for in §§ 5 and 6 of

McMILLAN C0. v. ABERNATHY.

Opinion of the Court.

that act. Thar substance, with amendments not here.
material, is now embodied in §§ 238, 128, 239, 240 and
241 of the Judicial Code. Section 238 provides for direct
appeals from the District Court to this Court in certified
questions of jurisdiction" of the District Court, in prize
cases, and in all cases in which federal constitutiofnal or
treaty questions are involved. Section 128 gives the
Circuit Courts of Appeals appellate jurisdiction in all
cases other than those in which direct appeals may be
taken to this Court under § 238, "unless otherwise provided by law." Except where under § 239 a questioli may
be certified to this Court by a Circuit Court of Appeals,or when under § 240" this Court may bring up a case
from the Circuit Court of Appeds by certiorari, the
judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals in cases
in which jurisdiction of the District Court is dependent
entirely on the diverse citizenship of the parties, in
patent and copyright cases, in revenue cases, in criminal
cases and in admiralty cases, are made final by § 128.
Certain other cases specified in the Act of January 28,
1915, c. 22, § 2, 38 Stat. 803, amending § 128, and in
the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, § 3, 39 Stat. 726,
are also made final in the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals not thus made
final and in which more than $1,000 is involved, may be
appealed to this Court under § 241.
The Act of 1891 was passed to relieve this Court from a
discouraging congestion of business. It was evidently intended that the Circuit Court of Appeals should do a large*
part of the appellate business. The act was not happily
drawn in defining the division of it between those courts
and this Court 'and' many difficulties have arisen.- It
suffices here to say that, under an unbroken line of authorities, when the plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of
the Federal District Court on the sole ground that his
case is one in which a substantial federal constitutional

442

or treaty question arises, this Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction thereof under § 238. American Refining
Co. v. New Orleans, 181 U. S. 277, 281; Huguley Mfg. Co.
v. Galeton Cotton Mills, 184 .U. S. 290,.295; Union &
Planters' Bank v. Memphis, 189 U. S. 71, 73; Spreckels
Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, '192 U. S. 397, 407; Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, 240 U. S. 305, 318;
Raton Water Works Co. v. Raton, 249 U. S. 552, 553;
Lemke v. FarmersGrain Co., 258 U. S. 50, 52.
It is said that there were two other questions involved
in these present cases in the District Court in addition to
the federal constitutional question, one of conformity of
the assessments to the city charter.and state law and the
other of res judicata. But they were not federal questions upon which the jurisdiction of the federal trial court
could rest, and therefore could furnish no ground for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals under § 128 or other
provision of law. To avoid the exclusive appellate jirisdiction of this Court over such an appeal in constitutional
or treaty questions "under§ 238, there must be diversity of
citizenship of the parties or the. other questions involved
must be federal and adequate themselves to support the
original jurisdiction. This was expressly ruled in Lemke
v. Farmers Grain Co., 258 U. S. 50, 53; s. c. sub nomine
Farmers' Grain Co. v. Langer, 273 Fed. 635; and obviously follows from the decisions in Lovell v. Newman &
Son, 227 U. S. 412; City of Pomona v. Sunset Telephone
Co., 224 U. S. 330, and Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v.
McClain, 192 U. S. 397, 407.
We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction of the appeals in these cases and that they
should have been dismissed, unless the Act of September
14, 1922, required that court to transfer them.
Second. When the Act of September 14, 1922, was
passed, the three months allowed for appeals to this Court
in these cases had expired. Appellees urge that. even if

the act in terms must be held to apply to these cases, it
would be beyond the power of Congress thus to'deprive
the appellees of their property in the decrees which had
vested when the three months had expired.
We do not find it necessary to consider this question or
the kindred one whether the Act of 1922 ought to be construed to be prospective and so not to include these appeals. We prefer to put our conclusion on a construction
of the act which shall have general application and of
which all litigants may have early notice, The time
allowed by law for appeals from the District Court to the
Circuit Courts of Appeals is in general six months (§ 11,
Act of March 3, 1801, 26 Stat. 826, 829, c. 517) or double
that allowed for appeals to this Court. We do not think
the Act of 1922 applies to any case in which the appeal to
the Circuit Court of Appeals is taken after the period for
appeals to this Court has expired. Otherwise the act will
enable one who negligently has allowed his right of appeal
to this Court to go by, to take his appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals and by transfer get 'into this Court, and
thus lengthen the time for direct appeals to this Court
from three to six months. This result we can not assume
Congress intended.
As the appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were not
taken within three months after the decrees appealed
from were entered, that court had no power to order a
transfer to this Court.
The cases are, therefore, remanded to the Circuit Court
of Appeals.
