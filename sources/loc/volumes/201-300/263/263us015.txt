The courts cannot limit the meaning of the words used
".so as to carve out a crime, by construing the statute to
mean that it applies only under certain conditions of
fact which are not expressed, and thus render it constitutional. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76;

MR. JusTIcE HOLNIES delivered the, opinion of the
Court.
This is an indictment in three counts. The first
charges a conspiracy to commit an offense against the
United States by making and presenting for payment a
fraudulent claim against the United States Emergency
Fleet Corporation, a corporation formed under the laws
of the District of Columbia, of which the United States
owned all the stock. The second count charges a like
conspiracy to obtain the payment of fraudulent claims
against the same corporation. The third count charges
a conspiracy to defraud the United States. All the
counts are based upon the same facts, and the first two
are brought under the Act of October 23, f918, c. 194;
40 Stat. 1015; amending § 35 of the Criminal Code and,

taken with § 37, making it a, crime to conspire to present
for, or to obtain, payment of a frbudulent claim against
"any corporation in which the United States of America
is a stockholder." The.third count is based upon § 37 of
the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321; 35 Stat.
1088, punishing conspiracy "to defraud the United States
in any manner or for any purpose." A demurrer to all
the counts was sustained by the District Court on the
grounds that the Act of 1918 must be taken literally, as
embracing any corporation in which the United States
owned a single share of stook, and so construed went
beyond the power of Congress, and that under United
States v. Strang, 254 U. S. 491, the fraud alleged was-not
a fraud upon the United States.
Taking up first the Act of 1918, it was enacted after
Congress contemplating the possibility of the war-that
ensued had authorized the formation of the Fleet Corporation under laws deriving their authority from earlier
statutes of the United States. We are not informed
whether at that time the United States owned stock in
corporations other than the instrumentalities created with
reference to the needs of that war, but we cannot doubt
that the act was passed with a special view to them.
United States v. Bowman, 260 U. S. 94, 101, 102. The
United States can protect its property by criminal laws,
and its constitutional power would not be affected if it
saw fit to create a corporation of its own for purposes of
the Government, under laws emanating directly or indirectly from itself, and turned the property over to its
creature. The creator would not be subordinated to its
own machinery. That is the case before us. If the law
in terms dealt only with the Emerkency'Fleet Corporation it would be beyond question. See United States
Grain Corporationv. Phillips, 261 U. S. 106, 113' It is
said however that the words "any corporation in which

the United States of America is a stockholder" are too
clear to be cut down. Butts v. Merchants Transportation Co., 230 U. S. 126, 136, 137. But against the cases
that decline to limit the generality of words in order to
save the constitutionality of an act are many others that
imply a limit, and, when the circumstances permit, the
latter course will be adopted. Language as absolute as
that before us was limited in The Abby Dodge, 223 U. S.
166, 172: "Any sponges taken . . .from the waters of the
Gulf of Mexico or Straits of Florida." See Texas v. Eastern.Texas R. R. Co., 258 U. S.204, 217. We are of opinion that the Act of 1918 should be construed to refer only
io corporations like the Fleet Corporation that are instrumentalities of the government and in which for that
reason it owns stock. In Uiited States v. Bowman, 260
U. S.94, the present objection was not raised by counsel
or by the .Court.
As to the third count, while it is true that the corporation is not the United States, United States v. Strang,
254 U. S.491, the contemplated fraud upon the corporation if successful would have resulted directly in a pecuniary loss to the United States, and even more immediately would have impaired the efficiency of its very important instrument. We are of opinion that it was
within the words of § 37, "defraud the United States in
any manner," and that on this as on the other point the
decision below was wrong. Haas v. Hencel, 216 U. S.
479, 480. United States v. Barnow, 239 U. S. 74, 79.
Judgment reversed.
