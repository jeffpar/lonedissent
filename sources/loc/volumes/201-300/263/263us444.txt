TIDAL OIL COMPANY ET AL. v. FLANAGAN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 179.

Motion to dismass or affirm submitted November 19,
1923.-Decided January 7, 1924.

1. An Act of February 17, 1922, amending Jud. Code, ยง 237, provides: "In any suit involving the validity of a contract wherein
it is clsimed that a change in the rule of law or construction of
statutes by the highest court of a State applicable to such contract would be repugnant, to the Constitution of the United States,
the Supreme Court shall, upon writ of error, reexamine, reverse,
or affirm the final judgment of the highest court of a State in
which a decision in the suit could be had, if said claim is made
in said court at any time before said final judgment is entered and
if the decision is against the claim so made."
Construed, as not seeking to add to the general appellate jurisdiction
of this Court, existing under prior legislation, but to permit review
by writ of error of the class of cases therein mentioned, in which
the defeated party claims that his constitutional rights have been
violated by the judgment of the state court itself; and to permit
the objection to be raised, in the state court, after the handing
down of its opinion, and to be raised here even though petition
for rehearing be denied by the state court without opinion. Pp.
450, 454.
2. The mere fact that a state Supreme Court decides against a
party's claim of property or contract right by reversing its earlier
decision of the law applicable to such cases, does not deprive him
of his property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, nor amount -to the passing of "any law " impairing the obligation of contracts, contrary to the contract clause
of the Constitution. Pp. 450, 451.
3. This has been c- often adjudged by the Court, that contenaons to
the contrary are without substance and a writ of error dependent on
them must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Pp. 450, 455.
4. Cases distinguished in which it has been held, that federal courts,
exercising jurisdiction based on diverse citizenship, to avoid injustice, but without invoking the contract clause, may decide and
enforce the state laNa as laid down by decisions of the state court
governing when a contract was made, rather than by its later
decisions; and those involving alleged impairment of contract by a

the state court is accepted, but the existence, Validity and scope
of the contract, (and, therein, the meaning of the state statutes
forming part of it,) and the effect upon the 6ontract.of the subsequent statute, are determined by this Court for itself. P. 451.

Insofar as Tidal Oil Company is concerned, it is conceded that the writ of error may only be sustained under
the Act of February 17, 1922, 42 Stat. 366, amending ยง 237,
Jud. Code.
The record presents this situation: The parties on
both sides claim through Marshall, a minor, to whom the
land was allotted. On June 30, 1913, the allottee, by his
guardian, entered into an agreement with one Arnold, in
settlement and compromise of certain controversies existing between them relative to the ownership of the allotment. On petition filed by the guardian in the probate
court of his appointment, that court approved and confirmed the agreement. The Oil Company claims as assignee of the lease, recognized and adopted by the guardian on behalf of the allottee with the approval of the
proper probate court.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

263 U. S.

Under the statutes of Oklahoma, as construed by its
highest court at the time the lease was so adopted and approved, the only requisite to the validity of this lease was,
that it be sanctioned or approved by the probate court
having jurisdiction of the guardianship. Duff v. Keaton,
33 Okla. 92; Allen v. Midway Oil Co., 33 Okla. 91; Cowles
v. Lee, 35 Okla. 159. See also Papoose Oil Co.v. Swindler, March 27, 1923, pending on rehearing and unreported.
. In its decision in the present case, the state Supreme
Court recognizes that guardians may lease lands of their
wards for oil and gas mining purposes, provided they are
made in the manner prescribed by law and under the
rules of this court which have been held to have the
force and effect* of a statute where the same are not ii
conflict with a statute," and cites its decisions in Winona
Oil Co. v. Barnes, 83 Qkla. 248, and Carlile v. National
Oil Co., 83 Okla. 217. In these decisions, rendered in
1921, the court had held, for the first time, and in conflict
with its prior decisions, that in order for the guardian of
a minor to make a valid lease on the ward's land, such.,
leases must be put up and sold at public auction to the
highest bidder.
The record shows that Marshall was a freedman allottee
of the Creek Nation, and all restrictions on his allotment
were.removed by Act of May 27, 1908, ยง 1, 35 Stat. 312.
The same act provides, in ยง 6, that such minor allottees
.are subject to the jurisdiction of the probate courts of
Oklahoma.
So that, in determining whether or not the lease, as
adopted by the guardian with approval of the probate
court, was valid or invalid, the only question involved was
the proper construction of the state statutes regulating the
procedure in such cases in the probate courts. Necessariy, therefore, by basing its decision on the Winona and
Carlile Cases, the court below followed the rule announced
in those cases, rather than the rule which applied under

TIDAL OIL CO. v. FLANAGAN.
444

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

its decisions as they stood at the time the transaction was
had. While the reasoning of the court on this point is
not Very clear, its effect as changing the rule of construction of the. applicable state statutes cannot be disputed.
This Court is not concerned with the reasoning, but with
its effect. McCullough v. 'Virginia, 172 U. S. 102. This
Court has repeatedly held that the obligation of contracts'
may be impaired by a change of judicial decision.
Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175;' Douglass v. Pike
County, 101 U. S. 677; Anderson v. Santa Anna, 116 U. S.
356; German Savings Bank v. FianklinCounty, 128 U. S.
526; Los Angeles.v. Los Angeles Water Co., 177 U. S. 558.
The Court has held, however, under the codes prior to
the amendment of February 17, 1922, that it- had no appellate jurisdiction to review this character of question on
writ of error to a state court. This, as we understand it,
is the rule announced in the cases cited by defendant in
error, such as: CentralLand Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103;
Bacon v. Texas, 163 U_ S. 207, and Rooker v. Fidelity
Trust Co., 261 U. S. 114. Evidently the amendment of
February 17, 1922, was for the express purpose of extending the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to cover cases
involving the impairment' of contract obligations by
change of' judicial decision in the construction of .applicable statutes. This is the plain language of the act.
It is contended, in the motion to dismiss, that plaintiff
in error has no right to a review under this act because
the federal question, if any exists, was presented to the-.
state court for the first time in the application for rehearing, and the application was denied without opinion. It
will be observed the act specifies that the claim of a"
change in the rule of construction may be made at any
time before final judgment is entered. The claim does
not have to be made before judgment is,'rendered. Because of the very purpose of the act, Congress must have
had in mind the distinction between the rendition of i

263 U. S.

judgment and- its entry. In the present case, as in all
others that may come within the amendment, the federal
question firgt arose when the state court rendered its
decision holding void the contract which, under prior construction' was valid. With just such a situation in view,
Congress evidently intended that the claim might b6 made
at any time before the cause had been finally disposed of
and closed in the state court.
There is no statute of the State specifically providing
for the entry or recording of judgments of the Supreme
Court. Under its rules, a case is not finally closed until
the petition for rehearing has been disposed of, or the
time has expired within which petition may be filed and
none has been filed. The record shows that the petition
for rehearing was filed withian extension of time granted
by the Supreme Court, and that itwas set down for oral
argument, argued and submitted.
IR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFr

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
J. P. Flanagan sued the Tidal Oil Company and
Eleanor Arnold in the District Court of Creek County;
Oklahoma, to quiet his title to two tracts of land therein
of eighty acres each. His title was based on a quitclaim
deed of Robert Marshall, an 'allottee and citizen of the
Creek Nation, executed in October, 1916, after Marshall
had attained his majority and had been discharged from
guardianship. The defendants derived their title from
the same allottee, but the deed under which they claimed
was made by Marshall when he was 14 years old and
married, and after he had been granted majority rights
by the District Court. He subsequently sought to have
this deed cancelled in a suit in the same court brought
by his guardian, but judgment went against him.
Defendants insisted that this judgment was conclusive
in the case at bar against the plaintiff as- subsequent

grantee of Marshall. After this judgment, and by way
of compromise,. gas and oil leases and contracts to convey were made in favor of defendants or their'grantors
by the guardian and approved by the County Court, and
these were also relie-t on to defeat plaintiff's title. The
District Court gave judgment in favor of Flanagan for
the lands and included a heavy recovery for mesne
lprofits. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed this
but somewhat reduced'the amount of recovery., It held
that the deed. and agreements and leases under which
defendants claimed were void because Marshall was a
minor when they were made; that the judgment of the
District Court against him and his guardian in their suit
to cancel the first deed was void because it appeared on
the face of the record that Marshall was then a minor
and that these were allotted lands, of the title to which
he could not be divested except in a Probate Court
under procedure required by, a state' statute and not.
complied with. The errors here assignbd are, first, that
the judgment deprived the defendants of their property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment; and, second, that the Supreme
Court of the State, in holding the judgment and conz
firmations of the District and County Courts to be void,
reversed its previous decisidns and changed a rule of
property of the State upon the faith of which the deed,
leases and 'other contracts set up by defendants-were
made, and thus impaired their obligation in violation of
ยง 10; Article I, of the Federal Constitution.
-A motion to dismiss is made by the defendant in error,
'because the federal questions were too late, in that they
were raised for the first time in petitions for rehearing
which the court denied without opinion. The record
does not sustain this ground in respect to, the objection
based on the Fourteenth Amendment, because that appears in the assignment of errors filed on the appeal from

the District Court to the State Supreme Court. The
assignment, however, has no substance in it. The parties
to this action have been fully heard in the state court
in the regular course of judicial proceedings and in such
a case the mere fact that the state court reversed a
former decision to the.tprejudice of one party does not
take away his property without due process of law. This
was expressly held in the case of Central Land Co. v.
Laidley, 159 U. S. 103, 112. See also Morley v. Lake

A ground for dismissal urged is that the validity of
no federal or state statute or authority exercised under
the ,f nited States or the State, was drawn in. question
in the state court on the ground of a 'repugnance to the
Federal Constitution, and hence there is no right to a
writ of error under ยง 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended
by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, and
that the only remedy available to the plaintiffs in error
was an application to this Court for certiorari because
they had been denied a right, title, privilege, or immunity,
granted by the' Federal Constitution. In answer, the
plaintiffs in euror invite attention to an Act of Congress
of February 17, 1922, c. 54, 42 Stat. 366, again amending
ยง 237, reading-as follows:
"In any suit involving the validity of a contract wherein
it is claimed that a change in ihe rule of law or construction of statutes by the highest court of a State applicable to such contract would be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, the Supreme Court shall,
upon writ of error, reexamine, reverse, or affirm the final
judgment of the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had, if said claim is made in said

TIDAL OIL CO. v. FLANAGAN.
444

Opinion of the Court.

court at any time before said final judgment is entered and
if the decision is against the claim so made."
The case before us seems clearly within the foregoing.
It does involve the validity of a contract, it is claimed that
a change in the rule of law by the highest court of the
State applicable to the contract is repugnant to the Federal Constitution, and the decision of that c6urt was
against the claim.
It has been settled by a long line of decisions,: that the
provision of ยง 10, Article I, of the Federal Constitution,
protecting the obligation of contracts against state action,'
is directed only against impairment by legislation and not
by judgments of courts. The language-" No State shall

pass any

.

law impairing the obligation

of contracts "-plainly requires such a conclusion. However, the fact that it has been necessary for this Court to
decide the question so maiiy times is evidence of nersistent
error in regard to it. Among the cases relied on to sustain the error, are Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175; Butz

Los Angeles City Water Co., 177 U. S, 558. These cases
were not writs of error to the Supreme Court of a State.
They were appeals or writs of error to federal 'bourts
where recovery was sought 'upon municipal or county
bbnds or some other form of contracts, the validity of
which had been sustained by decisions of the Supreme
Court of'a State prior to their execution, and had been denied by the same court 'after their issue or making, In
such cases the federal courts exercising jurisdiction between citizens of different States held themselves free to
decide What the state law was, and to enforce it as laid
down by the State Supreme Court before the contracts
were made rather than in later d~cision. They did not
base this conclusion on Article I, ยง 10, of the Federal Constitution, but on -thestate law as they determined it, which,
in diverse citizenship cases, under the third Article of the
Federal Co~stitution'they were empowered to do. Burgess
v Seligman, 107 U. S. 20. In such cases, as a general rule,,
they, in the interest of comity and .uniformity, followed
the decisions of state courts as to ,the state law, but where
gross injustice would be otherwise done, they followed the
earlier rather than the later decisions as to what it was.
Had'such cases been decided by -the state courts, however,
and had it been attempted to bring them here by writ of
error to the State Supreme Court, they would have presented no federal question, and this Court must have dis-'
missed the writs for lack both of power and jurisdiction.'
This is well illustrated by the cases of Gelpcke v. Dubuque,
1 Wall. 175, and Railroad Co. v. McClure, 10 Wall. 511.
'In the former, bonds sued on in the Circuit Court of 'the
United States, were collected under judgment of this
Court. In the latter, like bonds sued on in a state court
were held invalid, and a writ of error to the State Supreme
Court was dismissed.
.Other cases cited are Louisiana v. Pilsbury, 105 U. S;
278, and Muhlker v. New 1,ork & Harlem R. R. Co., 197

TIDAL OIL CO. v. FLANAGAN.

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 544, but in each of them a statute had been passed
subsequently to the contract involved and was held to
impair it. In such a case this Court accepts the meaning
put upon the impairing statute by the state court as authoritative, but it is the statute as enforced by the State
through its courts which impairs the contract, not the
judgment of the court.
There is another class of cases relied on to maintain'this
writ of error. They are those in which this Court has held
that in determining whether a state law has impaired a
contract, it must decide for itself whether there was a
contract and whether the- law as enforcedby the state
court impairs it. It often happens that a law of the State
constitutes part of the contract and, to make the constitutional inhibition effective, this Court must exercise an independent judgment in deciding as to the validity and
construction of the w and the existence and terms of the
contract. Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436,
443; Bridge Proprietorsv. Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 1.16, 145;
Wright v. Nagle, 101 U. S. 791, 793; and McGahey v.
Virginia, 135 U. S. 662, 667.
Then there are cases like McCullough v. Virginia, 172
U. S. 102; Houston & Texas Central R. R. Co. v. Texls,
177 U. S. 66, 76, 77; Hubert v. New Orleans, 215 U. S.
170, 175; Carondelet Canat Co. v. Louisiana, 233 U. S.
362, 376, and Louisiana Ry., & Nay. Co. v. New Orleans,
235 U. S. 164, 171. In each of. them the judgment of
the State- Supreme Court seemed from its opinion
merely to be a reversal- of -a previous construction by it
of a statute upon the faith of which the contract had
been wade.. In fact, however, the judgment merely gave*
effect to an existing subsequent statute impairing the
obligation of the contract which was thus a law passed in
violation of Article I,'ยง 10.
The difference'between all these classes of cases and the
present one wherein'it*is.claimed that a state court judg-

meni alone, and without any la~v, impairs'tile obligation
of a contract, has, been arefiflty pointed out in Central
Land Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103, 111, 112, in Bacon v.
Texas, 163'U. S. 207, 221, 223, and in Ross v. Oregon,
227 U. S. 150, 161. Certain unguarded language in
Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 206; Butz v. Muscatine,. 8 Wall. 575, 583, and in Douglass v. Pike County,
101 U. S. 677, 686-687, and in so.me other cases, has
caused confusion, although thdse cases did not really involv'e the contract impairment clause of the Constitution.
We come then to the last point made on behalf of plaintiffs in error. It may be best stated in the words of their
brief. After referring to Gelpcke v. Dubuque, supra,
Douglassv. Pike County, supra, Anderson v. Santa Anna,
supra, and German Savings Bank v. Franklin County,
supra, counsel say:
" The court has held, however, under the codes 'prior to
the amendment of February 17, 1922, that it had no appellate jurisdiction to review this character of question on
writ of error to a state court. This, as we understand it, is
the rule announcgd in the cases cited by defendant in
error, such as: Central Land Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103,
Bacon v. Texas, 163 U. S. 207, and Rooker v. Fidelity
Trust Co., 261 U. S. 114.
'Evidently the amendment of February 17, 1922, to
section 237 of the Judicial Code, was for the express purpose of extending the appellate jurisdiction of this court
to cover cases involving the impairment of contract obli* gations by change of judicial decision in the construction
of applicable statutes. This is the plain language of
the act."
The ihtention of Congress was not, we think, to add to
the ge~ieral appellate jurisdiction of this Court existing
under -prior legislation, lut rather to permit a review on
writ of error in a paricular class of cases in which the
defeated party claimsfhat his federal constitutional rights

have been violated by the judgment of the state court itself, and further to permit the raising of the objection
after the handing down of the opinion. This Court has
always held it a prerequisite to the consideration here of
a federal question in a case coming from a state court that
the question should have been raised in that court before
decision, or that it should have been actually entertained
aid considered upon petition to rehear. A mere denial
of the petition by the state court without opinion, is not
'enough. Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal, 251 U: S. 179, 181;
Bilby v. Stewart, 246 U.. S. 255; Missouri Pacific lRy. Co.

Carolina, 181 U. S. 580, 592; Pim v. St. Louis, 165
..U. S. 273.
It was the purpose of the Act of 1922 to change the rule
established by this formidable array of authorities as to
the class of cases therein described. The question in such
cases could not well be raised until the handing down of
the opinio.ft indicating that the objectionable judgment
was to follow. This act w s intended to secure to the defeated party the right to raise' the question here if the
state court denied the petition for rehearing withofit
opinion.
. We-can not assume that Congress attempted to give to
this Court appellate jurisdiction beyond the judicial
power accorded t6 the United States by the Constitution.
The there reversal by a state court of its previous decision,
as in this case before us, whatever its effect upon contracts, does not, as we have seen, violate any clause of the
Federal Constitution. Plaintiffs claim, therefore, does
not rise a substantial federal question. This has been

the power to foster, protect and control it, with proper regard for
the welfare of those who are immediately concerned as well as of
the public at large. P. 478.
2. Section 422 of the' Transportation Act 1920, by the new section,

the carriers, as a whole, or by rate groups 'or territories fixed by

to a general railroad revolving fund, to be inaintained by theCommission, (par. 6); that the carrier may use such reserve to pay
dividends, interest on securities, or rent for leased roads, to the
extent that. its net operating ific6m6 for any year is less than 6%,
