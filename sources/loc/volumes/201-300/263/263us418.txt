PARRAMORE, AS WIDOW AND GUARDIAN,
ETC., ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPRETE COURT OF THE STATE OF UTAH.
No. 107. Argued November 14, 1923.-Decided December 10, 1923.
1. Agreeably to the principles sustaining state workmen's compensation laws as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, an employer may be required to compensate his employee for an injury
of which his employment is a substantially contributory cause,
though not the sole or proximate one. P. 422.
2. Whether an accident is so related to the employment that exaction
of compensation may escape condemnation as clearly arbitrary and
unreasonable, must depend upon the particuldir' circumstances of
the case. P. 424.
3. An employee, going to work at his employer's factory by the customary and only practicable way, was killed by a locomotive while
crossing, on a public road, a railroad adjacent to the plant, a few
minutes before the time when his day's service as a stationary
engineer was to begin. Held, that imposition of liability on the employer for the benefit of the workman's dependents by a state
compensation law, was constitutional. P. 426.

MR.JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case arises under the provisions of the Utah Workmen's Compensation Act, which provides for the payment
of compensation -for personal injury or death of an employee b . ccident "arising out of or in the course of his
employment." Compiled Laws, Utah, 1917, ยง 3113, and
amendment, Laws, Utah, 1919, c. 63.
The Cudahy Packing Company, on August 9, 1921, and
prior thereto, owned and operated a m~at packing plant
at a point about six miles north of Salt Lake City. Its
employees generally resided in that city and in villages
located north-andsouth of 'the plant, only a few living in
the immediate vicinity thereof.
In 'going to and from the plant the workmen proceeded
along a main highway running north and south and passing the plant at a distance of about half a mile to the east.
From this point a public road runs west to and beyond the
plant, crossed, before reaching the plant, by three lines of
railroad, one of which, the Rio Grande Western, lies immediatel r adjacent to, and from which switches lead directly
into, the plant. The only practicable way of ingress and
egress for employees was along this road and across these
railroad tracks, and that was the way customarily used.
Joseph Parramore was, and for a considerable time had
been, employed at the plant at a weekly salary as a stationary engineer, lie lived a%Salt Lake City. On' the
morning of August 9, 1921, he rode to the plant in the
automobile *of another employee, for the purpose of going
'to work., The aigtomobile crossed over two of the railroad
tracks and when upon that of the Rio Grande was struck
by an engine and Parramore was instantly killed. This
happened about seven minutes before the time when his

service as an engineer was to begin. Upon these facts the
Utah Industrial Commission awarded compensation to.
Parramore's dependents. The Supreme Court of the State,
upon a review, affirmed the award and held that the accident was one within the terms of the statute. 60
Utah, 161.
By this construction and application of the statute we
are bound and the case must be considered as though the
statute had, in specific terms, provided for liability upon
the precise facts hereinbefore recited. Ward-& Gow v.
Krinsky, 259 U. S. 503, 510. The question sdv~d in the
state court and presented here is whether the statute; as
thus construed and applied, is valid under the provisions
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Defendants in error have submitted a motion to dismiss
the writ of error on the ground that no federal question is
involved, but it is clearly without substance, and is overruled.
That the statute is constitutional upon its face is established by previous decisions of this Court (New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, 243 U. S. 188; Hawkins v. Bleakly,
Id. 210; Mountain Timer Co. v. Washington, Id. 219;
Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, 250 U. S: 400; Madera Co. v. IndustrialAccident Commission,262 U. S. 499)
and the only inquiry we need make is whether it is constitutional as applied and enforced in respect of the facts
of the instant case. See Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v.
Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282, 288-289. It is settled by the
decisions of this Court and by an overwhelming array of
state decisions, that such statutes are not open to constitutional objection because they abrogate common law
defenses or impose liability without fault. But the contention here, shortly stated, is that the accident was one
which occurred off the premises of the employer on a
pubhi road, outside the hours of employment and while
the employee was not engaged in any business of the em-

ployer; that it was not the result of any industrial risk
but arose from a common peril to which the public generally 'was exposed; and that conseqiuently liability is imposed arbitrarily and capriciously., It may be assumed
that where an accident is in no manner related to the employment, an attempt to make the employer liable would
be so clearly unreasonable and arbitrary as to subject it to
the ban of the Constitution; but where the accident has
anr such relation we should be cautious about declaring
a state statute creating liability against the employer
invalid upon that ground. The modern development and
growth of industry, with the consequent changes in the
relations of employer and employee, have been so profound in character and degree as to take away, in large
measure, the applicability of the doctrines upon Which
rest the common law liability of the master for personal
injuries to a servant, leaving of necessity a field of debatable ground where a good deal must be cofaceded in
favor of forms of legislation, calculated to establish new
bases of liability more in harmony with these changed
conditions. Workmen's Compensation legislation rests
upon the idea of status, not upon that of implied contract;
that is, upon the coheption that the injured workman is
entitled to, compensation for an injury sustained in the
service of an industry to whose operations he contributes
his work as the owner contributes his capital-the one for
the sake of the wages and the other for the sake of the
profits.. The liability is based, not upon any act or onission of the employer, but upon the existence of the relationship which the employee bears to the employment because of and in the. course of which he has been injured.
And this is not to impose liability upon one person for an
injury sustained by another with which the former has no
connection; but it is to say that it is enough if there be a
causal connection between the injury and the business
in which he employs the latter-a connection substan-

tially contributory though it need not be the sole or prox-.
imate cause. Legislation which imposes liability for an
injury thus related to the employment, among other justifying circumstances, has a tendency to promote a -more
equitable distribution of the economic burdens in cases of
personal injury or death resulting, from accidents in the
course of industrial employment, and -is
a matter of sufficient public concern (Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, supra, p. 239) to escape, condemnation as arbitrary,
capricious or clearly unreasonable. Whether a given accident is so related or incident to the business must depend
-uponits own particular circumstances. No exact formula
can be laid down which will automatically solve every
case. The fact that the accident happens upon a public
road or at a railroad crossing and that the danger is one
to which the general public is likewise exposed is not conclusive against the existence of such causal relationship,
if the danger be one to which the employee, bk reason of
and in connection with his employment, is subjected peculiarly or to an abnormal degree.
Upon this question of causal relationship, the English
decisions are instructive., In Pierce v. Provident Clothing and Supply Co., Limited, [1911], 1 K. B. 997, where a
collector of the company, while riding a bicycle, in the
course of his employment, with the acquiescence of the
company, was knocked down and killed by a tramcar,'the
employer was held. liable because, by reason of his duties,
the employee was more exposed.to the risks, of the streets
than ordinary.rnembers of the public.. In the opinion by
Buckley, L. J., it is said (p. 1003): "An accidentarises out
of the employment where it results from a risk incidental
to the employment, as distinguished from a iisk common
to all mankind, although-the risk incidental to the employment may include a f'isk common to all mankind."
See also Martin v. J. Lovibond & Sons, Limited, [1914],

place and unddr circumstances exposing him to more than
ordinary risk of injury by lightning, such an injury 'was
held to be one arising out of the employment. Andrew v.
FailsworthIndustrialSociety, Limited, [1904], 2 K. B. 32.
In Anderson & Co., Limited, v. Adamson, 50 Scottish
Law Reporter, 855, Where a workman engaged during a
violent gale in erecting a structure was injured by a slate
blown from the roof of an adjoining building, a risk that
all persons Were more or less exposed to, it was held that
as the workman was obliged to work in a stooping position
and therefore could -not see the slate coming,, he. was exposed beyond the normal risk, and could recover. The
court said: "If it is the normal risk merely which causes
the accident, the answer'must be that the accident did not
arise out of the employment. But if the position Which
the workman must necessarily occupy in connection with
his work results in excessive exposure to the common risk
(cf. Ismay's case, [1908] A. C. 437; Rodger, 1912 S. C.,
584), or' if the continuity or exceptional amount of exposure aggravates the common riik (cf. M'Neice, 1911
S. C. '12; Warner [1912] A. C. 35), then it is open to conclude that the accident did not arise out of the common
risk but out of the employment."
The same ductrine has been declared, under the Anerican statutes, by many of the state courts. See, for example: Procaccino v. E. Horton & Sons, 95 -Conn. .408;
Empire Health & Accident Ins. Co.. v. Purcell, 76 Ind.
App. 551; Judson Manufacturing Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 181 Cal. 300; In re Bolman, 73 Ind.
App. 46; Lumbermen's Reciprocal Ass'n v. Behnken,
(Tex.) 226 S. W. 154, [aff'd 112 Tex. 103]; De Constantin
v. Public Service Commission, 75 W. Va. 32. The basis
of these decisions is that. under the special facts of each
case the employment itself involved peculiar and abnormal exposure to a cohmon peril, which was annexed as a
risk incident to the employment.

263 U. S.

Here the location of the plant was at a place so situated
as to make the customary and only practicable way of
-immediate ingress and egress one of hazard. Parramore
could not, at the point of the accident, select his way.
'He had no other choice than to go over the railway tracks
in order to get to his work; and he was in effect invited
by his, employer to do so. And this he wa. obliged to do
regularly and continuously as a necessary concomitant of
his employment, resulting in a degree of exposure to the
common risk beyond that to which the general -publicwas
subjected. The railroad over which the way extended
was not only immediately-adjacent to the plant but, by
means of switches, was connected with it and in principle
it was as though upon the actual premises of the employer.
We attach no importance to the fact that the accident
happened a few minutes before the time Parramore was to
begin work and was, therefore, to that extent, outside the
specified hours of employment. The employment contemplated his entry upon and departure from the premises
as much as it contemplated his working there, and must
include a reasonable interval of time for that purpose.
See Gane v. Norton Hill Colliery Co., [1909] 2 K. B. 539,
544; DeConstantinv. Public' ervice Commission, supra.
In view of the facts and circumstances peculiar to this
case it was fairly open to the State Supreme Court to conclude that the necessary causal relation between the employment and the accident sufficiently appeared to save it
from the constitutional objection; and its judgment is
accordingly.
Affirmed.
