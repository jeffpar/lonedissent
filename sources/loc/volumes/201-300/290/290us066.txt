365.
In Porter v. Davidson, 62 Fed. 626, 629, a similar cone.1,sion was reached under a North Carolina statute.
That court, after stating the rule laid down in Freemanv.
Howe, supra, Covell v. Heyman, supra, and other cases,
held that these decisions went only to the possession of
the res, and that the remedy might be pursued against
the sheriff for damages in any court. "The proceedings
of the plaintiff in this case by which he took from the possession of the sheriff the chattels levied on was ancillary,
not in any way affecting the merits of the original case.
That can go on without conflicting with any of the cases
quoted above."
The court of appeals did not consider the question
whether petitioner had made out a case of actual posses,ion in Oregon. Nor can we say from the very general
words of the judge in granting respondent's motion and'
in discharging the jury that this precise question of fact
was passed upon by the trial court. We, therefore, do
not consider it, but leave it to be disposed of in
the further proceedings which must be had in the district court.
Judgments reversed and cause remanded to the district
court for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.

FIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO. OF MARYLAND v.
ARENZ.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 1. Argued October 10, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.
1. By means of materially false written statements in respect to his
financial condition, a contractor induced a surety company to
execute a surety bond conditioned on his performance of a state

highway contract. Upon default by the contractor, the surety
became obligated upon a judgment obtained against them jointly
by one who had furnished labor and materials entering into the
work. The surety paid and took an assignment of the judgment.
The contractor subsvquently was adjudged bankrupt, and upon his
application for discharge from his debts, including that due the
surety, the latter filed objections. Held:
(1) The obligation of the surety according to the terms of the
bond to pay the contractor's debt was "property" within the
meaning of § 14 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended (11 U.S.C., §
32 (b) (3)) barring discharge where the,bankrupt " obtained money
or property on credit . ..by making . . . a materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition." P. 69.
(2) The bankrupt obtained, and the surety gave, the bond and
obligation "on credit" within the meaning of the section. P. 69.
(3) The application for discharge should have been denied.
P. 70.
2. The word "property," when used without qualification, may
reasonably be construed to include obligations, rights and other
intangibles, as well as physical things. P. 68.
61 F. (2d) 607, reversed.

CERTIORARi, 288 U.S. 597, to review a judgment affirming an order of the District Court granting a discharge
in bankruptcy.
Mr. John Lichty, with whom Mr. Elton Watkins was
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. John C. Veatch submitted for respondent.
MR. JUsTIcE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1929 respondent, for the purpose of procuring a contract with Oregon for highway construction and in compliance with applicable statutes (§§ 49-701 and 67-1101,
Oregon Code, 1930), gave to the State a bond on which
petitioner was surety conditioned that he would pay for
labor and material entering into the work. He failed,
and one who had furnished him labor and material sued
on the bond and obtained a judgment for $10,000 against

principal and surety jointly. Petitioner paid and took an
assignment of the judgment. In 1931 respondent, having been adjudged bankrupt, applied for discharge from
his debts including that due petitioner on account of such
payment. Petitioner filed objections showing that respondent induced it to become surety by means of materially false written statements in respect of his financial
condition. Respondent demurred. The district court
sustained the demurrer and entered a decree of discharge.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 61 F. (2d) 607,
following decisions of district courts in that circuit. In re
Tanner, 192 Fed. 572, and In re Ford, 14 F. (2d) 848.
The Bankruptcy Act, § 14 as amended, 11 U.S.C., § 32
(b) (3), requires denial of discharge if the bankrupt
"obtained money or property on credit .. . by making

It was a means by which he procured the contract and
was security for the payment of his indebtedness incurred
for labor or material required to do the work. But respondent insists that the bond is not property and that his
fraud in obtaining it is not within the condemnation of
clause (3). "Property" is a word of very broad meaning,
and when used without qualification, expressly made or
plainly implied, it reasonably may be construed to include
obligations, rights and other intangibles as well as physical things. Delassus v. United States, 9 Pet. 117, 133.

Opinion of the Court.

Cincinnati v. Halfer, 49 Oh. St. 60, 65; 30 N.E. 197. Dillingham v. Insurance Co., 120 Tenn. 302, 315; 108 S.W.
1148. For the meaning rightly here to be given the word,
regard is to be had to the statute and connection in which
it is found. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Tennessee,
262 U.S. 318, 323. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Jersey City, 207
Fed. 871, 876. The Act, while making discharge of bankrupts the general rule, conditions the grant upon adherence by every applicant to the standards of honesty and
fair dealing in business transactions that are required or
reflected in § 32 (b) (1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7). The
fraud perpetrated by respondent is of the kind condemned.
Giving effect to the rule that legislative intent controls, it
is plain that " property" includes petitioner's obligation
according to the terms of the bond to pay respondent's
debts., Matter of Dunfee, supra. Gaddy v. Witt (Tex.,
Civ. App.) 142 S.W. 926. Royal Indemnity Co. v. Cooper,
supra. In Gleason v. Thaw, 236 U.S. 558, this court held
that the professional services of an attorney were not
within § 17 (2), which excepts from the general discharge
liabilities for property obtained by false pretenses. That
was a close case. See 185 Fed. 345, 196 Fed. 359. The
principle of construction there applied may not reasonably be extended to this one.
It remains to be considered whether the respondent obtained petitioner's obligation "on credit." Principal and
surety must be held to have had in contemplation all liabilities that naturally might arise from such a contract.
Matter of Dunfee, supra. Respondent was bound by
agreement, implied by law if not expressly made, that he
would make good to petitioner whatever the latter as such
surety might be required to pay. Petitioner gave its obligation, not for the premium alone, but also in consideration of respondent's promie to reimburse it. Having regard to the results that at the beginning the parties were
reasonably bound to anticipate, it is clear that respondent

obtained, and peitioner gave, the bond and obligation on
credit. See Swarts v. Siegel, 117 Fed. 13, 17. Kobusch v.
Hand, 156 Fed. 660, 662. While clause (3) seems aimed
particularly at false pretenses made by borrowers and purchasers to obtain money or goods on credit (Firestone v.
Harvey, 174 Fed. 574, 577), it is not limited to such transactions. Respondent's application for discharge should
have been denied.

UNITED STATES ET AL. v. LOUISIANA ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 17.

Argued October 13, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

1. Section 13 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which empowersthe Commission 'to remove unjust discrimination by intrastate
rates against interstate commerce by prescribing minimum intrastate rates, is to be taken as supplementing § 15a (2), and, so construed, empowers it to raise intrastate rates so that the intrastate
traffic may produce its fair share of the revenue required to meet
maintenance and operating costs and to yield a fair return on the
value of property devoted to the transportation service, both interstate and intrastate. P. 75.
2. In the performance of its duty, under § 15a (2), of providing adequate revenue for groups of carriers, the Commission is not obliged
to undertake the impossible task of finding in advance of the order
raising rates, the reasonableness of each individual rate; it is
enough if, with proper procedure and supported by evidence, it find
that the increases to be allowed, when applied to members of a
group, will generally not exceed reasonable maxima, reserving to all
interested parties the right to secure modification of any particular
rates which, when challenged, may be found to be unjust or unreasonable. P. 75.
3. This same principle applies when intrastate rates are raised, under
§ 13 (4), to the level of interstate rates increased under § 15a (2).
P. 78.
4. Findings of the Commission, read with its reports, held sufficient
as findings that, through failure to contribute such increased
