SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT,
No. 50.

Argued October 9, 10, 1933.--Decided November 6, 1933.

1. To make out a dying declaration the declarant must have spoken
without hope of recovery and in the shadow of impending death,
and this state of mind must be exhibited in the evidence and
not left to conjecture. P. 99.
2. On a trial for murder by poison, where the defense was suicide,
a statement that deceased had made, accising the defendant of
having poisoned her, and which was offered and erroneously let
in as a dying declaration so that it must have been considered by
the jury as testimony to the act of poisoning, can not be treated
on appeal as properly in the case because, as evidence of the
declarant's state of mind, it tended to rebut defensive evidence
of suicidal intention. P. 102.
3. A trial may become unfair if testimony offered and erroneously
accepted for one purpose, is used in an appellate court as though
admitted for a different purpose, unavowed and unsuspected. P. 103.
4. Evidence having a dual tendency, inadmissible and gravely prejudicial for one purpose but not objectionable for another if separately considered, should be excluded from the jury where the
feat of ignoring it in the one aspect while considering it in the
other is too subtle for the ordinary mind apd the risk of confusion
is so great as to upset the balance of practical advantage. P. 103
5. The declarations of deceased persons (short of dying declarations)
which may be used to show their intentions for the future must
be sharply distinguished from declarations of memory merely and
from those that recite the past conduct of other persons. P. 106.

The statement by the deceased that her husband
poisoned her was a statement of a fact and not her
opinion.
Were the declarations of the deceased competent as
tending to show her state of mind and rebut the theory
of suicide, and was it error not to restrict the evidence
to that purpose? We have found nothing of substantial
value to add to the discussion of this question by the
court below.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioner, Charles A. Shepard, a major in the
medical corps of the United States army, has been convicted of the murder of his wife, Zenana Shepard, at Fort
Riley, Kansas, a United States military reservation. The
jury having qualified their verdict by adding thereto the
words " without capital punishment" (18 U.S.C. § 567),
the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for life.
The judgment of the United States District Court has
been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit, one of the judges of that court dissenting.
62 F. (2d) 683; 64 F. (2d) 641. A writ of certiorari
brings the case here.
The crime is charged to have been committed by
poisoning the victim with bichloride of mercury. The
defendant was in love with another woman, and wished
to make her his wife. There is circumstantial evidence

to sustain a finding by the jury that to win himself his
freedom he turned to poison and murder. Even so, guilt
was contested and conflicting inferences are possible.
The defendant asks us to hold that by the acceptance of
incompetent evidence the scales were weighted to his
prejudice and in the end to his undoing.
The evidence complained of was offered by the Government in rebuttal when the trial was nearly over. On
May 22, 1929, there was a conversation in the absence of
the defendant between Mrs. Shepard, then ill in bed, and
Clara Brown, her nurse. The patient asked the nurse to
go to the closet in the defendant's room and bring a bottle
of whisky that would be found upon a shelf. When the
bottle was produced, she said that this was the liquor she
had taken just before collapsing. She asked whether
enough was left .to make a test for the presence of poison,
insisting that the smell and taste were strange. And then
she added the words "Dr. Shepard has poisoned me."
The conversation was proved twice. After the first
proof of it, the Government asked to strike it out, being
doubtful of its competence, and this request was granted.
A little later, however, the offer was renewea, the nurse
having then testified to statements by Mrs. Shepard as
-to the prospect of recovery. "She said she was not going
to get well; she was going to die." With the aid of this
new evidence, the conversation already summarized was
proved a second time. There was a timely challenge of
the ruling.
She said, "Dr. Shepard has poisoned me." The admission of this declaration, if erronleous, was more than unsubstantial error. As to that the parties are agreed. The
voice of the dead wife was heard in accusation of her
husband, and the accusation was accepted as evidence of
guilt. If the evidence was incompetent, the verdict may
not stand.

SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES.
96

Opinion of the Court.

1. Upon the hearing in this court the Government finds
its iman prop in the position that what was said by Mrs.
Shepard was -admissible as a dying declaration. This is
manifestly the theory upon which it was offered and received. The prop, however, is a broken reed. To make
out a dying declaration the declarant must have spoken
without hope of recovery and in the shadow of impending
death. The record furnishes no proof of that indispensable condition. So, indeed it was ruled by all the judges
of the court below, though the majority held the view that
the testimony was competent for quite another purpose,
which will be considered later on.
We have said that the declarant was-not shown to have
spoken without hope of recovery and in the shadow of
impending death. Her illness began on May 20. She
was found in -a state of collapse, delirious, in pain, the
pupils of her eyes dilated, and the retina suffused with
blood. The conversation with the nurse occurred two
days later. At that time her mind had cleared up, and
her speech was rational and orderly. There was as yet no
thought by any of her physicians that she was dangerously
ill, still less that her case was hopeless. To all seeming
she had greatly improved, and was moving forward to
recovery. There had been no diagnosis of poison as the
cause of her distress. Not till about a week afterwards
was there a relapse, accompanied by an infection of the
mouth, renewed congestion of the eyes, and later hemorrhages of the bowels. Death followed on June 15.
Nothing -inthe condition of the patient on May 22
gives fair support to the conclusion that hope had then
been lost. She may have thought she was going to die and
have said so to her nurse, but this was consistent with
hope, which could not have been put aside without more
to quench it. Indeed, a fortnight later, she said to one
of her physicians, though her condition was then grave,

OCTOBER TERM, 1933:Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

"You will get me well, won't you?" Fear or even belief
that illness will end in death will not avail of itself to
make a dying declaration. There must be "a settled hopeless expectation" (Willes, J. in Reg. v. Peel, 2 F. & F. 21,
22) that death is near at hand, and what is said must have
been spoken in the hush of its impending presence. Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 151; Carver v. United
States, 160 U.S. 553; 164 U.S. 694; Rex v. Perry, [1909]
2 K.B. 697; People v. Sarzano, 212 N.Y. 231, 235; 106
N.E. 87; 3 Wigmore on Evidence, §§ 1440, 1441, 1442, collating the decisions. Despair of recovery may indeed be
gathered from the circumstances if the facts support the
inference. Carverv. United States, supra;Wigmore, Evidence, § 1442. There is no unyielding ritual of words to
be spoken by the dying. Despair may even be gathered
though the period of survival outruns the bounds of expectation. Wigmore, § 1441. What is decisive is the state
of mind. Even so, the state of mind must be exhibited in
the evidence, and not left to conjecture. The patient
must have spoken with the consciousness of a swift and
certain doom.
What was said by this patient was not spoken in that
mood. There was no warning to her in the circumstances
that her words would be repeated and accepted as those
of a dying wife, charging murder to her husband, and
charging it deliberately and solemnly as a fact within her
knowledge. To the focus of that responsibility her mind
was never brought. She spoke as one ill, giving voice to
the beliefs and perhaps the conjectures of the moment.
The liquor was to be tested, to see whether her beliefs were
sound. She did not speak as one dying, announcing to
the survivors a definitive conviction, a legacy of knowledge
on which the world might act when she had gone.
The petitioner insists that the form of the declaration
exhibits other defects that call for its exclusion, apart
from the objection that death was not imminent and that

SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

hope was still alive. Homicide may not be imputed to a
defendant on the basis of mere suspicions, though they are
the suspicions of the dying. To let the declaration in, the
inference must be permissible that there was knowledge
or the opportunity for knowledge as to the acts that are
declared. Wigmore, § 1445 (2). The argument is pressed
upon us that knowledge and opportunity are excluded
when the declaration in question is read in the setting of
the circumstances. On the one side are such cases as
Berry v. State, 63 Ark. 382; 38 S.W. 1038; State v. Wi.k8,
278 Mo. 481; 213 S.W. 118; State v. Williams, 67 N.C. .12;
State v. Jefferson, 125 N.C. 712; 34 S.E. 648; Shaw v. People, 3 Hun 272; 63 N.Y. 36; Stewart v. Commonwealth,
235 Ky. 670, 679; 32 S.W. (2d) 29; and Commonwealth
v. Griffith, 149 Ky. 405; 149 S.W. 825; on the other, Shenkenberger v. State, 154 Ind. 630; 57 N.E. 519; State v.
Kuhn, 117 Ia. 216, 228; 90 N.W. 733; Fults v. State, 83
Tex. Cr. 602; 204 S.W. 108; Cook v. State, 90 Tex. Cr. 424;
235 S.W. 875; cf. the cases cited in 11 A.L.R. 567, note,
and 25 A.L.R. 1370, note. The form is not decisive, though
it be that of a conclusion, a statement of the result with
the antecedent steps omitted. Wigmore, § 1447. "He
murdered me," does not cease to be competent as a dying
declaration because in the statement of the act there is
also an appraisal of the crime. State v. Mace, 118 N.C.
1244; 24 S.E. 798; State v. Kuhn, 8upra. One does not
hold the dying to the observance of all the niceties of
speech to which conformity is exacted from a witness on
the stand. What is decisive is something deeper and more
fundamental than any difference of form. The declaration is kept out if the setting of the occasion satisfies the
judge, or in reason ought to satisfy him, that the speaker
is giving expression to suspicion or conjecture, and not to
known facts. The difficulty is not so much in respect of
the governing principle as in its application to varying and
equivocal conditions. In this case, the ruling that there

was a failure to make out the imminence of death and
the abandonment of hope relieves us of the duty of determining whether it is a legitimate inference that there wao
the opportunity for knowledge. We leave that question
open.
2. We pass to the question whether the statements to
the nurse, though incompetent as dying declarations, were
admissible on other grounds.
The Circuit Court of Appeals determined that, they
were. Witnesses for the defendant had testified to declarations by Mrs. Shepard which suggested a mind bent
upon suicide, or at any rate were thought by the defendant -to carry that suggestion. More than once before her
illness she had stated in the hearing of these witnesses
that she had no wish to live, and had nothing to live for,
and on one occasion she added that she expected some d@y
to make an end to her life. This testimony opened the
door, so it is argued, to declarations in rebuttal that she
had been poisoned by her husband. They were admissible, in that view, not as evidence of the truth of what
was said, but as betokening a state of mind inconsistent
with the presence of suicidal intent.
(a) The testimony was neither offered nor received foir
the strained and narrow purpose now suggested as legitimate. It was offered and received as proof of a dying
declaration. What was said by Mrs. Shepard lying ill
upon hex deathbed was to be weighed as if a like statement had been made upon the stand. The course of the
trial makes this an inescapable conclusion. The Government withdrew the testimony when it was unaccompanied
by proof that the declarant expected to die. Only when
proof of her expectation had been supplied was the offer
renewed and the testimony received again. For the reasons already considered, the proof was inadequate to show
a consciousness of impending death and the abandonment
of hope; but inadequate though it was, there can be no

SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES.
96

Opinion of the Court.

doubt of the purpose that it was understood to serve.
There is no disguise of that purpose by counsel for the
Government. They concede in all candor that Mrs.
Shepard's accusation of her husband, when it was finally
let in, was received upon the footing of a dying declaration, and not merely as indicative of the persistence of a
will to live. Beyond question the jury considered it for
the broader purpose, as the court intended that they
should. -A different situation would be here if we could
fairly say in the light of the whole record that the purpose
had been left at large, without identifying token. There
would then be room for argument' that demand -should
have been made for an explanatory ruling. Here the
course of the trial put the defendant off his guard. The
testimony was received by the trial judge and offered by
the Government with the plain understanding that it was
to be used for an illegitimate purpose, gravely prejudicial.
A trial becomes unfair if testimony thus accepted may be
used in an appellate court as though admitted for a different purpose, unavowed and unsuspected. People v.
Zackowitz, 254 N.Y. 192, 200; 172 N.E. 466. Such at all
events is the result when the purpose in reserve is so obscure and artificial that it would be unlikely to occur to
the minds of uninstructed jurors, and even if it did, would
be swallowed up and lost in the one that was disclosed.
(b) Aside, however, from this objection, the accusatory
declaration must have been rejected as evidence of a state
of mind, though the purpose thus to limit it had been
brought to light upon the trial. The defendant had tried
to show by Mrs. Shepard's declarations to her friends that
she had exhibited a weariness of life and a readiness to
end it, the testimony giving plausibility to the hypothesis
of suicide. Wigmore, § 1726; Commonwealth v. Trefethen, 157 Mass. 180; 31 N.E. 961. By the proof of these
declarations evincing an unhappy state of mind the defendant opened the door to the offer by the Government

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

of declarations evincing a different state of mind, declarations consistent with the persistence of a will to live. The
defendant would have no grievance if the testimony in
rebuttal had been narrowed to that point. What the Gov ernment put in evidence, however, was something very
different. It did not use the declarations by Mrs. Shepard
to prove her present thoughts and feelings, or even her
thoughts and feelings in times past. It used the declarations as proof of an act committed by some one else, as
evidence that she was dying of poison given by her husband. This fact, if fact it was, the Government was free
to prove, but not by hearsay declarations. It will not do
to say that the jury might accept the declarations for any
light that they cast upon the existence of a vital urge, and
reject them to the extent that they charged the death to
some one else. Discrimination so subtle is a feat beyond
the compass of ordinary minds. The reverberating clang
of those accusatory words would drown all weaker sounds.
It is for ordinary minds, and not for psychoanalysts, that
our rules of evidence are framed. They have their source
very often in considerations of administrative convenience,
of practical expediency, and not in rules of logic. When
the risk of confusion is so great as to upset the balance of
advantage, the evidence goes out. Thayer, Preliminary
Treatise on the Law of Evidence, 266, 516; Wigmore,
Evidence, §§ 1421, 1422, 1714.
These precepts of caution are a guide to judgment
here. There are times when a state of mind, if relevant,
may be proved by contemporaneous declarations of feeling or intent. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, 145 U.S.
285, 295; Shailer v. Bumstead, 99 Mass. 112; Wigmore,
§§ 1725, 1726, 1730. Thus, in proceedings for the probate
of a will, where the issue is undue influence, the declarations of a testator are competent to prove his feelings for
his relatives, but are incompetent as evidence of his conduct or of theirs. Throckmorton v. Holt, 180 U.S. 552,

suits for the al'ination of affections, letters passing between the spouses are admissible in aid of a like purpose,
Wigmore, § 1730; Ash v. Prunier, 105 Fed. 722; Mutual

426; 102-S.E. 769; Curtis v. Miller, 269 Pa. 509, 512; 112
Atl. 747. In damage suits for personal injuries, declarations
by the patient to bystanders or physicians are evidence of
sufferings or symptoms (Wigmore, §§ 1718, 1719), but are
not received to prove the acts, the external circumstances,
through which the injuries came about. Wigmore,
§ 1722; Amys v. Barton, [1912] 1 K.B. 40; C. & A. R. Co.
v. Industrial Board, 274 Ill. 336; 113 N.E. 629; Peoria

v. Maryland Casualty Co., 172 Wis. 350; 178 N.W. 749.
Even statements of past sufferings or symptoms are generally excluded, (Wigmore, § 1722 [b]; Cashin v. N. Y.,
N. H. & H. R. Co., 185 Mass. 543; 70 N.E. 930), though
an exception is at times allowed when they are made to a
physician. Roosa v. Loan Co., 132 Mass. 439, 440;
C. C. C. & I. R. Co. v. Newell, 104 Ind. 264, 271; 3 N.E.
836; contra, Davidson v. Cornell, 132 N.Y. 228, 237; 30
N.E. 573. So also in suits upon insurance policies, declarations by an insured that he intends to go upon a journey
with another, may be evidence of a state of mind lending
probability to the conclusion that the purpose was fulfilled. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, supra. The ruling in that case marks thehigh water line beyond which
courts have been unwilling to go. It has developed a
substantial body of criticism and commentary.* Decla*Maguire, The Hillmon Case, 38 Harvard L. Rev., 709, 721, 727;

rations of intention, casting light upon the future, have
been sharply distinguished from declarations of memory,
pointing backwards to the past. There would be an end,
or nearly that, to the rule against hearsay if the distinction were ignored.
The testimony now questioned faced backward and not
forward. This at least it did in its most obvious implications. -What is even more important, it spoke to a past
act, and more than that, to an act by some one not the
speaker.. Other tendency, if it had any, was a filament too
fine to be disentangled by a jury.
The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in
accordance with this opinion.

DASHER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 30.

Argued October 18, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

A turnover order addressed to the president of a bankrupt corporation who has fraudulently concealed and is withholding the goods,
is not to be held invalid for want of a sufficient description if the
one given, though general, is clear enough to be understood by
him and is as definite as possible under the circumstances. P. 108.
The goods in question were part of the stock in trade of a drug
business. Their cost had been computed by deducting from the
cost of all goods owned by the bankrupt in the life of the business,
the total amount of sales, less gross profits, and the cost value
of the goods that had come to the trusteb or receiver. The
description in the order was as follows: "balance of merchandise
in the hands of the said R. F. Dasher at the time of bankruptcy
at a cost price value of $19,157.66, of a class of merchandise
shown by the proofs of claim to have been purchased on the credit
of the bankrupt corporation and delivered to it, and of such a
