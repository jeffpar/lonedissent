ALASKA STEAMSHIP CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 56. Argued November 15, 1933.-Decided December 4, 1933.
1. The provision of Rev. Stat., § 4578, for compensating vessel
owners who bring home destitute seamen, though in terms applicable only where the transportation is by agreement with a consular officer and under his certificate, applies, by long administrative and legislative construction, to transportation from Alaska
(where there are no consular officers) upon agreements and certificates of the local collector or deputy collector of customs. P. 259.
2. Courts are slow to disturb the settled administrative construction
of a statute long and consistently adhered to, especially where the
declared will of the legislative body could not be carried out without the construction adopted. P. 262.
3. The administrative construction must be accepted in the present
case, since it has received congressional approval, implicit in the
annual appropriations over a perioa of thirty-five years, the expenditure of which was effected by resort to the administrative
practice, and in amendments by Congress to the statutes relating
to transportation of destitute seamen without modification of that
practice. P. 262.
4. Under the Acts of Congress, the duty of providing transportation
for shipwrecked mariners rests upon the Government; it is not a
duty incumbent upon the owner of the shipwrecked vessel, and he
is entitled to the statutory compensation for this service. P. 262.
5. The practice that aids as an administrative construction is the practice of the Department charged with carrying out the statute, in
this case the practice of the Department of Commerce. P. 264.
6. Rulings of the Comptroller General resting upon a -proposition
plainly contrary to law and in conflict with the unambiguou statute in question, are without weight as administrative constructions. P. 264.

to review the affirmance .of a judgment

dismissing a suit- against the United States under the
Tucker Act. Opinion of the District Court: 60 F. (2d)
135.
Mr. Norman M. Littell, with whom Mr. Cassius E.
Gates was on the brief, for petitioner.
Assistant Solioitor General MacLean, with whom
Solicitor General Biggs and Mr. J. Frank Staley were on
the brief, for the United States.
This suit, by the pleadings, was rested solely upon the
certificate issued by the deputy collector of customs under
assumed authority of Rev. Stat., §§ 4577, 4578, as
amended, U.S.C., Title 45, §§ 678, 679, as establishing the
indebtedness. Since deputy collectors of customs are not
consular officers, no right to payment can be sustained by
the certificate itself.
The Comptroller General, since the question first received consideration, has uniformly ruled that when the
owner of a wrecked vessel returns the members of the
crew by another of his vessels, he may not be reimbursed
from public funds for the costs of transportation. Subsequentl to these rulings, Congress rebnacted the previously related statutes. Consistent construction in the
administration of these statutes by the fiscal officer should
be regarded as the authoritative interpretation. See
Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 288
U.S. 269, 273; Castanzo v. Tillinghast, 287 U.S. 341, 345;

H. R. Co., 287 U.S. 178, 110.
In returning the seamen, '-e petitioner only performed
an obligation which the law imposed upon it. It is not
entitled to be reimbursed for the expense. This follows
the practice in Great Britain. It is stated that the obligation is modified by the last sentence of § 4526, Rev

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this suit, brought under the Tucker Act, 24 Stat.
505, in the District Court for Western Washington, petitioner sought compensation at an agreed rate for the
transportation of certain destitute seamen from Ketchikan, Alaska, to Seattle, under the provisions of § 4578
R.S., as amended, 46 U.S.C. § 679. That section imposes
on masters of United States vessels homeward bound the
duty, upon request of consular officers, to receive and
carry destitute seamen to the port of destination at such
compensation not exceeding a specified amount as may
be agreed upon by the master with a consular officer, and
authorizes the consular officer to issue certificates for such
transportation "which shall be assignable for collection." By § 4526 R.S., 17 Stat. 269, as amended December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 46 U.S.C., § 593, seamen, whose
term of service is terminated by loss or wreck of their
vessel, are "destitute seamen," and are requited to be
transported as provided in § 4578.
The demand in the present case was for compensation
for the transportation of the crew of the S.S. Depere,

ALASKA STEAMSHIP CO. v. U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

owned by petitioner, which had been wrecked on the
Alaska coast and for that reason had been unable to complete her voyage. The crew was received 'and carried
to Seattle on petitioner's S.S. Yukon, on certificate of the
deputy customs collector of Alaska that he had agreed
with the master for their transportation at a specified
rate. The Comptroller General refused payment upon
the certificate on the sole ground that it was the duty of
petitioner to transport to the United States the crew of its
own wrecked vessel, and that the Congressional appropriation for the relief of American seamen was not available to compensate the owner for performing that duty.
Judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint,
60 F. (2d) 135, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, on the ground that the certificate of
the deputy collector authorizing the transportation did
not satisfy the requirement of the statute that the certificate should be that of a consular officer. 63 F. (2d) 398.
This court granted certiorari.
The government, conceding that the statute by long
administrative practice has been construed as authorizing
payment for transportation of seamen from Alaska on the
certificate of deputy customs collectors, insists that it
does not authorize payment to the owner for the transportation of the crew of his own wrecked vessel and that
such has been its administrative construction.
1. If the statutory language is to be taken literally,
the certificate, which by R.S. § 4578 is authority for the
transportation and evidence of the right of the vessel to
compensation, must be that of a consular officer. Deputy
collectors of customs are not consular officers and there
are no consular officers in Alaska. If the right to compensation is dependent upon certification by a consular
officer the statutes providing for transportation of destitute seamen can be given no effect in Alaska. But the
meaning of this provision must be ascertained by reading

it with related statutes and in the light of a long and consistent administrative practice.
Since 1792 the statutes of the United States have made
provision for the return of destitute seamen to this
country upon suitable action taken by consular officers
of the United States.' And since 1803 the government
has undertaken to compensate for their transportation.'
Beginning in 1896, Congress has made provision for the
relief of American seamen shipwrecked in Alaska in
annual appropriation bills for the maintenance of the
diplomatic and consular service. The appropriation bill
for that year, 29 Stat. 186, and every later one has extended the benefits of the appropriation for the relief of
American seamen in foreign countries to "American seamen shipwrecked in Alaska." ' -The appropriation for
1922 and 1923, c. 204, 42 Stat. 599, 603; c. 21, 42 Stat.
1068, 1072, contained the proviso, not appearing in previous acts, that no part of the appropriation should be
available for payment for transportation in excess of a
specified rate agreed upon by a consular officer and the
master of the vessel. The proviso did not appear in subsequent appropriation acts, but by Act of January 3,
1923, 43 Stat. 1072, it was transferred to its proper place
in the shipping laws, where it now appears in § 680 of
Title 46 of the United States Code. The Act of 1929, 45
Stat. 1098, applicable when the seamen in the present
case were transported, appropriated $70,000 " for relief,
'Act of April 14, 1792, c. 24, 1 Stat. 254, 256.
Act of February 28, 1803, U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 2, 204.
The substance of these statutes was carried forward as R.S. §§ 4577,
4578, 4579. These sections were amended by § 9 of the Act of June
26, 1884, c. 121, 23 Stat. 53, 55; as amended, they became §§ 679,
680 and 681 of Title 46, U.S.C.
'Before 1896 the provision in the appropriation bill wlas stated to
be for the relief and protection of American seamen in foreign countries, Acts of 1892 and 1893, 27 Stat. 233, 506; Acts of 1894 and 1895,

Opinion of the Court.

protection and burial of American seamen in foreign
countries, in the Panama Canal Zone, and in the Philippine
Islands, and shipwrecked American seamen in the Territory of Alaska, in the Hawaiian Islands, in Porto Rico
and in the Virgin Islands." By the amendment of R.S.
§ 5226 of December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 46 U.S.C.,
§ 593, it was provided that where the service of a seaman
terminates by reason of the loss or wreck of the vessel,
"he shall not be entitled to wages for any period beyond
such termination of the service and shall be considered as
a destitute seaman, and shall be treated and transported
to port of shipment," as provided in R.S. § 4578. No
exception is made in the case of transportation of seamen
from Alaska or other dependencies of the United States.
Thus, from 1896 to the present time) there has been a
definite obligation on the part of the government to provide transportation for shipwrecked seamen without ref-.
erence to the place where shipwrecked, and funds have
been annually appropriated for the purpose of carrying out
that obligation in the case of seamen shipwrecked in
Alaska. As appears from the findings of the trial court,
not challenged here, the appropriations have been expended for the transportation of shipwrecked seamen from
Alaska, in conformity to a practice established and consistently followed at least since 1900. Certificates for the
transportation of shipwrecked seamen have been regularly
signed and issued by the collector of customs or the deputy
collector in Alaska upon forms provided by the Bureau of
Navigation of the Department of Commerce. That Bureau, which has a general superintendence over merchant
seamen of the United States, 46 U.S.C., § § 1 and 2, has
regularly supplied its customs officials and its agents in
Alaska with these forms, with instructions that they were
to be used in arranging transportation of shipwrecked seamen to the United States, as provided by the sections of
the statute to which reference has been made. The stipu-

lated amounts due for the transportation, as certified, have
been regularly paid without objection upon presentation
of the certificate to the disbursing officer of the United
States.
Courts are slow to disturb the settled administrative
construction of a statute long and consistently adhered to.
Brown v. United States, 113 U.S. 568, 571; United States
v. Philbrick, 120 U.S. 52, 59; United States v. G. Falk &
Bro., 204 U.s. 143, 151. This is especially the case where,
as here, the declared will of the legislative body could not
be carried out without the construction adopted. That
construction must be accepted and applied by the courts
when, as in the present case, it has received Congressional
approval, implicit in the annual appropriations over a
period of thirty-five years, the expenditure of which was
effected by resort to the administrative practice, and in
amendments by Congress to the statutes relating to transportation of destitute seamen without modification of that
practice. United States v. G. Falk & Bro., supra; compare United States v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 278 U.S.
269.
2. The rejection of petitioner's claim by the Comptroller
General rests upon the supposed duty of the owner to
transport to the home port the seamen of its own wrecked
vessel." Diligent search by counsel of the ancient learning
of the admiralty has failed to disclose the existence of any
such duty. At most, in the absence of statutory command
or of stipulations in the shipping articles providing otherwise, the rights of the seamen after shipwreck, preventing
the completion of the voyage, appear to have been limited
to wages payable from freight earned on the voyage or to
'Similar rulings appear to have been made in the following cases:

wages or salvage from the vessel they have helped to save.'
It is unnecessary for us to consider to what extent these
rights have survived the statutes regulating the duties of
the owner toward the seamen or what bearing they may
have on the duty of the owner to transport the seamen.
For there is no finding and no evidence in the present case
that the wrecked vessel had earned freight on her voyage
or had been salvaged either with or without the aid of her
seamen. Under those statutes we think it plain that no
duty is imposed on the owner to provide transportation for
seamen of his own wrecked vessel and that the statutory
undertaking of the government is not upon condition that
destitute seamen shall be transported upon vessels other
than those of the owner of the wrecked vessel.
There are numerous instances in which the statutes of
the United States specifically impose on the master the
duty to provide seamen with transportation if he does not
secure employment for them on another vessel.' But
there is no statute imposing any duty on the vessel or
owner to provide transportation for seamen who may be
shipwrecked or who are discharged because incapacitated
for further service. See R.S. § 4581, 46 U.S.C., § 683.

1744, 249; Abbott, Laws of Shipping, Am. Ed. by Justice Story,
1854, 780. But see The Elizabeth, 2 Dods. 403, 412.
'The following instances may be noted: Where a seaman leaves a
vessel because she was previously sent to sea in an unseaworthy state
by neglect or design of the owner, R.S. § 4561, 18 U.S.C. § 658;
where a seaman is discharged because his vessel is sold abroad, R.S.

§ 4582, 46 U.S.C. § 684; where a seaman leaves the vessel because the
voyage is continued contrary to agreement, or because the vessel is
badly provisioned or unseaworthy, or because he had been subjected
to cruel treatment, R.S. § 4583, 46 U.S.C. § 685; see also R.S.
§ 4522, 46 U.S.C. § 703.

264

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Syllabus.

290 U.S.

The statutes terminate seamen's right to wages with the
termination of their service by the shipwreck, and without
qualification impose on the government the obligation to
transport them. It cannot be supposed that the performance of this obligation, which since the early days of
the government has been treated by Congress as a public
duty, was intended to be conditional upon the ability of
seamen, left destitute in a distant land, to induce the shipowner to transport them in performance of a supposed
duty which the statute neither imposes nor mentions.
The Department of Commerce, not the Comptroller
General, is charged with the administration of the statute,
4 Comptroller General Rep., 252, 253, and its administrative practice should be followed if thought to be controlling. But in any case, there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute with respect to the point urged by
the government, and, in carrying it out as written, there
is no administrative difficulty which would call for construction. The rulings of the Comptroller General rest
upon a proposition so plainly contrary to law and so
plainly in conflict with the statute as to leave them without weight as adIninistrative constructions of it. United
