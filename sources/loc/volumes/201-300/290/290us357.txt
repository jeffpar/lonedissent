exempt. We see no token of a purpose to extend a like
immunity to permanent investments or the fruits of business enterprises. Veterans who choose to trade in land or
in merchandise, in bonds or in shares of stock, must pay
their tribute to the state. If immunity is to be theirs, the
statute conceding it must speak in clearer terms than the
one before us here.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee disallowing the exemption has support in other courts. State

FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO.

No. 162.

Argued November 6, 7, 1933.-Decided December 11, 1933.

1. The term "Indian country," as used in the Act of June 30, 1834,
regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, was intended to include any unceded lands owned or occupied by. an
Indian nation or tribe of Indians; and it continues to have that
meaning, save in instances where the context of the Act shows
that a different meaning is intended. P. 364.
2. The people of the Pueblo of Isleta are Indian wards of the United
States, and the lands owned and occupied by them under their
ancient grant are "Indian country" within the meaning of U.S.C.,

APPEAL under the Criminal Appeals Act from a judgment of the District Court which sustained a demurrer
to an indictment.
Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General MacLean and Messrs. Harry S. Ridgely and W.
Marvin Smith were on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. George R. Craig submitted the cause and Mr.
David A. Grammer filed a brief for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the Court.
By indictment in the federal district court for New
Mexico, Gregorio Chavez and Jose Maria Chavez, described as "non-Indians," were charged with the larceny,
on January 3, 1932, "at and within the limits of the
Pueblo of Isleta, the same being Indian Country, in the
State and district of New Mexico," of certain live-stock
belonging to designated Indians of that Pueblo. By a
demurrer the defendants challenged the indictment as
not stating an offense against the United States, and in
support of the challenge asserted (1) that the Pueblo of
Isleta is not Indian country within the meaning of the
statutes whereon the indictment is founded, and (2)

Opinion of the Court.

that, even if the Pueblo be Indian country, larceny committed therein by one who is not an Indian is not within
those statutes. The court sustained the demurrer, dismissed the indictment and gave a certificate declaring in
effect that the judgment was put entirely on the ground
that when the statutes underlying the indictment are
properly construed-and particularly when construed in
the light of the act enabling New Mexico to become a
State-they do not make larceny within the Pueblo of
Isleta by one not an Indian, even of property belonging
to an Indian, an offense against the United States, but
leave the same to be dealt with exclusively by and under
the laws of the State.
The case is here on appeal by the United States under
the criminal appeals law. 1
By §§ 451 and 466, Title 18, U.S.C.,2 larceny committed
in any place " under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States" is made an offense against the United
States, the punishment described varying according to
the value of the property stolen; and by § 217, Title 25,
U.S.C.,' the general laws of the United States relating to
the punishment of crimes committed in any place within
its exclusive jurisdiction are extended, with exceptions
not material here, to " the Indian country." These are
the statutes on which the present indictment is founded.
By the enabling act of June 20, 1910,' and two subsequent joint resolutions,' Congress provided forthe admission of New Mexico into the Union as a State "on aft

equal footing with the original States." Compliance with
stated conditions was made a prerequisite to the admission, and these conditions were complied with. The admission became effective through a proclamation' of the
President on January 6, 1912.0 One of the conditions
related to Indians and Indian lands and to the respective
relations thereto of the United States and the State. The
provisions embodying this condition are copied in an
appended note.!
The lands of the Pueblo of Isleta, like those of other
pueblos of New Mexico, are held and occupied by the
people of the pueblo in communal ownership under a
grant which was made during the Spanish sovereignty,
037 Stat. 1723.

'Section 2 of the enabling act prescribed that the convention called
to form a constitution for the proposed State should provide by ordinance made a part of the constitution" First. That . . . the sale, barter, or giving of intoxicating liquors
to Indians and the introduction of liquors into Indian country, which
term shall also include all lands now owned or occupied by the Pueblo
Indians of New Mexico, are forever prohibited.
"Second. That the people inhabiting said proposed State do agree
and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title . . . to all
lands lying within said boundaries owned or held by any Indian or
Indian tribes the right or title to which shall have been acquired
through or from the United States or any prior sovereignty, and that
until the title of such Indian or Indian tribes shall have been extinguished the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition and
under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the
United States; . . . but nothing herein . . . shall preclude the said
State from taxing, as other lands and other property are taxed, any
lands and other property outside of an Indian reservation owned or
held by any Indian, save and except such lands as have been granted
or acquired as aforesaid or as may be granted or confirmed to any
Indian or Indians under any Act of Congress, but . . . all such lands
shall be exempt from taxation by said State so long and to such extent
as Congress has prescribed or may hereafter prescribe.

Indian reservations or allotments in said proposed State shall be

was recognized during the Mexican dominion and has
since been confirmed by the United States.
The people of these pueblos, although sedentary rather
than nomadic, and disposed to peace and industry, are
Indians in race, customs and domestic government. Always living in separate communities, adhering to primitive modes of life, largely influenced by superstition and
fetichism, and chiefly governed according to crude customs inherited from their ancestors, they are essentially a
simple, uninformed and dependent people, easily victimized and ill-prepared to cope with the superior intelligence
and cunning of others. By a uniform course of action,
beginning as early as 1854 and continued up to the present time, the legislative and executive branches of the
Government have regarded and treated them as dependent
Indian communities requiring and entitled to its aid and
protection, like other Indian tribes.8
In 1904 the territorial court, finding no congressional
enactment expressly declaring these people in a state
of tutelage or assuming direct control of their property,
held their lands taxable like the lands of others.' But
Congress quickly forbade such taxation by providing: 11
" That the lands now held by the various villages or
pueblos of Pueblo Indians, or by individual members
thereof, within Pueblo reservations or lands, in the Territory of New Mexico, and all personal property furnished
allotted, sold, reserved, or otherwise disposed of, they shall be subject
for a period of twenty-five years after such allotment, sale, reservation,
or other disposal to all the laws of the United States prohibiting the
introduction of liquor into the Indian country; and the terms 'Indian' and ' Indian country' shall include the Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico and the lands now owned or occupied by them."
'See United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, and United States v.
Candelaria, 271 U.S. 432, where the matters bearing on the history,
characteristics, status and past treatment of the Pueblo Indians of
New Mexico are extensively stated and reviewed.

said Indians by the United States, or used in cultivating
said lands, and any cattle and sheep now possessed or
that may hereafter be acquired by said Indians shall be
free and exempt from taxation of any sort whatsoever, including taxes heretofore levied, if any, until Congress
shall otherwise provide."
In 1907 the territorial court, for a like reason, held that
the Pueblo Indians were not wards of the Government in
the sense of the legislation forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquor to Indians and its introduction into the
Indian country.11 But that decision was soon followed by
the declaration, in the enabling act of 1910, that "the
terms 'Indian' and 'Indian country' shall include the
Pueblo Indians of New Mexico and the lands now owned
or occupied by them." And in 1924 Congress, in taking
measures to protect these Indians in their land titles, expressly asserted for the United States the status and
powers belonging to it "as guardian of said Pueblo
Indians." 12
In United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, this Court,
after full examination of the subject, held that the status
of the Indians of the several pueblos in New Mexico is
that of dependent Indian tribes under the guardianship
of the United States and that by reason of this status
they and their lands are subject to the legislation of Congress enacted for the protection of tribal Indians and their
property. We there said (pp. 45, 46):
"Not only does the Constitution expressly authorize
Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes,
but long continued legislative and executive usage and an
unbroken current of judicial decisions have attributed to
the United States as a superior and civilized nation the
power and the duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its
" United States v. Mares, 14 N.M. 1: 88 Pac. 1128.

Opinion of the Court.

borders, whether within its original territory or territory
subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the
limits of a State....
"Of course, it is not meant by this that Congress may
bring a community or body of people within the range
of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe,
but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities
the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time
they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes
requiring the guardianship and protection of the United
States are to be determined by Congress and not by the
courts."
We then pointed out that neither their citizenship, if
they are citizens, nor their communal ownership of the
full title in fee simple is an obstacle to the exercise of
such guardianship over them and their property. We also
there disapproved and declined to follow the decision in
the early case of United States v. Joseph, 94 U.S. 614,
relating to these Indians, because it was based upon reported data which in the meantime had been found to
be at variance with recognized sources of information
and with the long continued action of the legislative and
executive departments.
In United States v. Candelariai, 271 U.S. 432, we were
called upon to determine whether the people of a pueblo
in New Mexico were a "tribe of Indians" within the
meaning of § 2116 of the Revised Statutes, declaring that
no purchase of lands "from any Indian nation or tribe
of Indians" shall be of any validity unless made with
specified safeguards; and the conclusion to which we
came, and the reasons for it, are shown in the following
excerpt from the opinion (pp. 441, 442):
"This provision was originally adopted in 1834, c. 161,
sec. 12, 4 Stat. 730, and, with others 'regulating trade and
intercourse with the Indian tribes,' was extended over
'the Indian tribes' of New Mexico in 1851, c. 14, sec. 7,
9 Stat. 587.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

"While there is no express reference in the provision to
Pueblo Indians, we think it must be taken as including
them. They are plainly within its spirit and, in our opinion, fairly within its words, 'any tribe of Indians.' Although sedentary, industrious and disposed to peace, they
are Indians in race, customs and domestic government,
always have lived in isolated communities, and are a simple, uninformed people, ill-prepared to cope with the
intelligence and greed of other races. It therefore is
difficult to believe that Congress in 1851 was not intending to protect them, but only the nomadic and savage
Indians then living in New Mexico. A more reasonable
view is that the term ' Indian tribe' was used in the acts
of 1834 and 1851 in the sense of 'a body of Indians of
the same or a similar race, united in a community under
one leadership or government, and inhabiting a particular
though sometimes ill-defined territory.' Montoya v.
United States, 180 U.S. 261, 266. In that sense the term
easily includes Pueblo Indians."
Section 217 now being considered, like the section considered in that case, was originally a part of the act of
1834. One speaks of " Indian country" and the other of
an " Indian nation or tribe of Indians." The act as a
whole makes it apparent that the term "Indian country"
was intended to include any unceded lands owned or occupied by an Indian nation or tribe of Indians, and the
term continues to have that meaning, save in instances
where the context shows that a different meaning is intended. 18 Nothing in any of the statutes now being considered requires that it be given a different meaning in
this instance.
It follows from what has been said that the people of
the Pueblo of Isleta are Indian wards of the United
States; that the lands owned and occupied by them under
Clairmont v. United States, 225 U.S. 551, 557, et seq.; Donnelly v.
United States, 228 U.S. 243, 268; United States v. Pelican, 232 U.S.

their ancient grant are Indian country in the sense of
§ 217; that the United States, in virtue of its guardianship, has full power to punish crimes committed within
the limits of the pueblo lands by or against the Indians
or against their property--even though, where the offense
is against an Indian or his property, the offender be not
an Indian "--and that the statutes in question, rightly
construed, include the offense charged in the indictment.
There is nothing in the enabling act which makes
against the views here expressed. True, it declares, in
keeping with the constitutional rule, that the State shall
be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the
original States. But the principle of equality is not disturbed by a legitimate exertion by the United States of
its constitutional power in respect of its Indian wards and
their property. 5
As the District Court's judgment rested upon a mistaken construction of the statutes the judgment cannot
stand.
Judgment reversed.
