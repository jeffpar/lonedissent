Applying these principles, no ground appears for the
taxation of all the cars of the appellant in Oklahoma. It
is true that the cars went out from and returned to Oklahoma, being loaded and reloaded at the refinery, but they
also entered and were employed in other States where the
oil was delivered. Oklihoma was entitled to tax its
proper share of the property employed in the course of
business which these records disclose, and this amount
could be determined by taking the number of cars which on
the average were found to be physically present within the
State.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma are
reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

FUNKHOUSER ET AL. v. J. B. PRESTON CO., INC.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 72.

Submitted November 9, 1933.--Decided December 4, 1933.

1. Section 480, New York Civil Practice Act, as amended, providing
that interest shall be added to recoveries in actions for unliquidated
damages caused by breach of contract, did not impair the obligation of an earlier contract which did not create an obligation not
to demand such interest, either by its own terms, or when read
with the law applicable when it was made. P. 166.
2. The purpose of the statute was to supply a definite, uniform rule
of compensation for delay in settling unliquidated damages in lieu
of the uncertain rules previously developed by judicial decision.
Provision of the enlarged remedy was consistent with the contract
here involved and can not be regarded as an unreasonable exercise
of legislative power. Pp. 166-168.

party may have full compensation, concern the procedure for enforcing the obligation, of the contract. P. 167.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Section 480 of the Civil Practice Act of New York, as
amended by Chapter 623 of the Laws of 1927, provides for
the allowance of interest on the principal sum awarded by
verdict, report or decision for breach of contract, whether
the principal sum so awarded was "theretofore liquidated
or unliquidated."'
This action was brought for breach of a contract, made
in 1923, for the sale by appellee to appellants of red slate
granules to be delivered in agreed quantities in that year
and in the three years following. The trial, in 1930, resulted in a verdict for appellee, to the amount of which
interest was added pursuant to the statute. On appeal,
the Appellate Division struck out the allowance of interest
as not permissible with respect to a claim arising before
the statute was enacted. 235 App. Div. 200; 256 N.Y.S.
681. The Court of Appeals entertained the question presented under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (Art. I, ยง 10) and decided that the allowance of
interest did not impair the obligation of the contract.
261 N.Y. 140; 184 N.E. 737. The Court directed that the
item of interest be restored, and from the judgment
entered accordingly this appeal is taken.
'The provision is:---" In every action now pending or hereafter
brought wherein any sum of money shall be awarded by verdict,
report or decision upon a cause of action for the enforcement of or

based upon breach of performance of a contract, express or .nlied,
other than a contract to marry, interest shall be recovered upon the
principal sum whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated and
shall be added to and be a part of the total sum awarded."

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

The claim in suit was admittedly for unliquidated damages. There was no provision in the cornact with respeat to the recovery of interest in case of breach-that is,
either for or against such recovery. Thus, the terms of
the contract did not in themselves, and apart from the
applicable law, create an obligation not to demand interest. The opinion of the Court of Appeals shows that at
the time of the making of the contract the law of New
York was not clear and certain as to the allowance of
interest, citing White v. Miller, 78 N.Y. 393, 397; Faber
v. New York, 222 N.Y. 255, 262; 118 N.E. 609; Blackwell
v. Finlay, 233 N.Y. 361; 135 N.E. 600; Prager v. N. J.
Fidelity & Plate Glass Ins. Co., 245 N.Y. 1, 7; 156 N.E. 76.
The Court quoted the statement made in the year 1918
in Faber v. New York, supra, as follows:
"The question of the allowance of interest on unliquidated damages has been a difficult one. The rule on this
subject has been in evolution. Today, however, it may
be said that if a claim for damages represents a pecuniary
loss, which may be ascertained with reasonable certainty
as of a fixed day, then interest is allowed from that day.
The test is not whether the demand is liquidated. Was
the plaintiff entitled to a certain sum? Should the defendant have paid it? Could the latter have determined
what was due, either by computations alone or by computation in connection with established market values,
or other generally recognized standards?"
"This," said the court in the instant case, "was the
somewhat vague and indefinite law of the State of New
York" at the time the parties entered into their contract.
The court added that "It has never been held to be a part
of the obligation of the contract that no interest should
be allowed on unliquidated demands. . . . The amendment to section 480 of the Civil Practice Act changes a
rule of the common law but it conflicts with no constitutional guarantee. It prevents an escape through pro-

Opinion of the Court.

cedural difficulties from the real obligation to make full
compensation for breach of contract .... The rule of
law was that if the defendant could not determine on
any fixed day what was due, no interest could be recoverable because defendant knew not what, if anything, he
should pay. That was a rule of convenience, not an
agreement to forego interest. The implied obligation of
the o ntract was to pay interest in accordance with the
rules of law existing when the case was tried."
While it is the duty of this Court, where the contract
clause is invoked, to determine for itself what the contract is and whether it has been impaired,- we find nothing
requiring us to reach a conclusion different from that of
the Court of Appeals. The statute in question concerns
the remedy and does not disturb the obligations of the
contract. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 200;
League v. Texas, 184 U.S. 156, 158; Waggoner v. Flack,
188 U.S. 595, 601-603; Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U.S.
516, 530; Henley v. Myers, 215 U.S. 373, 385. Compare
Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, 285 U.S. 467, 474. The contractual obligation of appellants was to take and pay for
the described articles; and the law, in force when the
contract was made, required that in case of breach appellants should make good the loss sustained by the appellee. The ascertainment of that loss, and of what would
constitute full compensation, was a matter of procedure
within the range of due process in the enforcement of the
contract. "To enact laws providing remedies for a violation of contracts" and " to alter or enlarge those remedies
from time to time," was within the competency of the
legislature. Waggoner v. Flack, supra. The mere fact

that such legislation is retroactive does not bring it into
conflict with the guarantees of the Federal Constitution
(League v. Texas, supra, p. 161), and when the action of
the legislature is directed to the enforcement of the obligations assumed by the parties and to the giving of suitable
relief for non-performance, it cannot be said that the obligations of the contract have been impaired. The parties
make their contract with reference to the existence of the
power of the State to provide remedies for enforcement
and to secure adequate redress in case of breach. Henley
v. Myers, supra.
Without attempting to review the numerous, and not
harmonious, decisions upon the allowance of interest in
the case of unliquidated claims,3 it is sufficient to say that
the subject is an appropriate one for legislative action in
order to provide a definite rule. The statutory allowance
is for the purpose of securing a, more adequate compensation by adding an amount commonly viewed as a reasonable measure of the loss sustained through delay in payment. It has been recognized that a distinction, in this
respect, simply as between cases of liquidated and unliquidated damages, is not a sound one.' Whether the
case is of the one class or the other, the injured party has
suffered a loss which may be regarded as not fully compensated if he is confined to the amount found to be
recoverable as of the time of breach and nothing is added
for the delay in obtaining the award of damages. Because of this fact, the rule with respect to unliquidated
claims has been in evolution (Faber v. New York, supra),
and in the absence of legislation the courts have dealt
with the question of allowing interest according to

their conception of the demands of justice and practicality. Miller v. Robertson, 266 U.S. 243, 258. "The
disinclination to allow interest on claim of uncertain
amount seems based on practice rather than theoretical
grounds." -Williston on Contracts, vol. III, ยง 1413.
Whether there shall be a definite rule is a matter within
the legislative discretion, as is that of providing for interest upon judgments. Morley v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry.
Co., 146 U.S. 162, 168; Missouri & Arkansas Co. v.
Sebastian County, 249 U.S. 170, 173.
The decisive point in the instant case is that the provision for the enlarged remedy was consistent with the
substantial rights of the parties under their contract and
cannot be regarded as an unreasonable exercise of legislative power.

No. 94.

Argued November 17, 1933.-Decided December 4, 1933.

1. A State may make reasonable regulations as to the use of its
highways by private contract carriers, interstate or intrastate,
requiring them to pay reasonable license fees and to provide insurance to compensate third persons for injuries caused by negligent
operations of such carriers. P. 171.
2. The South Carolina statute here involved does not compel private

contract carriers to become common carriers. Id.
3. Construction of this statute by the state court, to the effect that
private contract carriers are not requied49by it to fvrnish *Fargo
insurance," held conclusive in this Court. P. 172.
4. Objection that the statute is fatally indefinite held untenable, its
requirements of the party complaining having been defined by construction, by the state supreme court. Id.
5. The Court will not pass upon a suggested construction of a state
statute and its validity if so construed when the questions, upon
the showing made, are purely academic. Id.
