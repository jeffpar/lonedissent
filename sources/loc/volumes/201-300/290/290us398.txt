HOME BUILDING & LOAN ASSOCIATION

v. BLAISDELL

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA.
No. 370.

Argued November 8, 9, 1933.-Decided Jantary 8, 1934.

1. Emergency does not increase constitutional power, nor diminish
constitutional restrictions. P. 425.
2. Emergency may, however, furnish occasion for exercise of power
possessed. P. 426.
3. The clause providing that no State shall pass any law impairing
the obligation of contracts is not to be applied with literal exactness, like a mathematical formula, but is one of the broad clauses
of the Constitution which require construction to fill out details.
Pp. 426, 428.
4. The necessity of construction of the contract clause is not obviated
by its association in the same section with other and more specific
provisions which may not admit of construction. P. 427.
5. The exact scope of the contract clause is not fixed by the debates
in the Constitutionai Convention or by the plain historical reasons,
including the prio1 legislation in the States, which led to the
adoption of that clause and of other prohibitions in the same section of the Constitution. Pp. 427, 428.
6. The obligation of a contract is not impaired by a law modifying
the remedy for its enforcement but not so as to impair substantial
rights secured by the contract. P. 430.
7. Decisions of this Court in which statutes extending the period of
redemption from foreclosure sales were held unconstitutional do
not control where the statute in question safeguards the interests

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.

of the mortgagee-purchaser by conditions imposed on the extension. P. 431.
8. The contract clause must be construed in harmony with the
reserved power of the State to safeguard the vital interests of her
people. Reservation of such essential sovereign power is read into
contracts. P. 434.
9. The legislation is to be tested, not by whether its effect upon contracts is direct or is merely incidental, but. upon whether the end
is legitimate and the means reasonable and appropriate to the end.
P. 438.
10. The principle of harmonizing the contract clause and the reserved
power precludes a construction permitting the State to repudiate
debts, destroy contracts, or deny means to enforce them. P. 439.
11. Economic conditions may arise in which a temporary restraint of
enforcement of contracts will be consistent with the spirit and
purpose of the 'contract clause, and thus be within the range of the
reserved power of the State to protect the vital interests of the
community. Marcus Broun Co. v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170; Block
v. Hirsh, id. 135. Pp. 434,440.
12. Whether the emergency still exists upon which the continued
operation of the law depends, is always open to judicial inquiry.
P. 442.
13. The great clauses of the Constitution must be considered in the
light of our whole experience, and not merely as they would be
interpreted by its framers in the conditions and with the outlook
of their time. P. 443.
14. A Minnesota statute, approved April 18, 1933, declares the
existence of an emergency demanding an exercise of the police
power for the protection of the public and to promote the general
welfare of the people, by temporarily extending the time allowed
by existing law for redeeming real property from foreclosure and
sale under existing mortgages. In support of this proposition, it
recites: That a severe financial and economic depression has
existed for several years, resulting in extremely low prices for the
products of farms and factories, in much unemployment, in almost
complete lack of credit for farmers, business men and property
owners, and in extreme stagnation of business, agriculture and
industry; that many owners of real property, by reason of these
conditions, are unable and, it is believed, for some time will be
unable, to meet all payments as they come due, of taxes, interest

and principal of mortgages, and are, therefore, threatened with
the loss of their property through foreclosure sale; that much
property has been bid in on foreclosure for prices much below
what it is believed was its real value, and often for much less
than the mortgage indebtedness, resulting in deficiency judgments;
that, under the existing conditions, foreclosure of many real estate
mortgages by advertisement would prevent fair, open and comThe
petitive bidding in the manner contemplated by law.
Act then provides, inter alia, as to foreclosure sales, that, where
the period for redemption has not already expired, the mortgagor
or owner in possession, by applying to a state court before its
expiration, may obtain an extension for such time as the court
may deem just and equitable, but in no case beyond May 1, 1935.
The application is to be made on notice to the mortgagee. The
court is to find the reasonable income or rental value of the property, and, as a condition to any extension allowed, is to order the
applicant to pay all, or a reasonable part, of that value, in or
towards the payment of taxes, insurance, interest and mortgage
indebtedness, at such times and in such manner as to the court,
under all the circumstances, shall appear just and equitable. If
the applicant default in any payment so ordered, his right to
redeem shall terminate in 30 days. The court is empowered to
alter the terms of extensions as change of conditions may require.
The Act automatically extends, to 30 days from its date, redemption periods which otherwise would expire within that time. It
is to remain in effect only during the emergency and in no event
beyond May 1, 1935. Prior to that date, no action shall be maintained for a deficiency judgment, until the period of redemption,
as allowed by existing law or as extended under the Act, shall have
a proceeding under the statute, it appeared
expired.-In
that the applicants, man and wife, owned a lot, in a closely built
section of a large city, on which were a house and garage; that
they lived in part of the house and offered the remainder for rent;
that the reasonable present market value of the property was
$6,000, and the reasonable value of the income and of the rental
value, $40 per month; that on May 2, 1932, under a power of sale
in a mortgage held by a building and loan association, this property had been sold for $3,700, the amount of the debt, and bid in
by the mortgagee, leaving no deficiency; that taxes and insurance
since paid by the mortgagee increased this amount to $4,056. The
court extended the period of redemption, which would have expired May 2, 1933, to May 1,1935, upon condition that the mort-

gagor pay $40 per month from date of sale throughout the extended period, to be applied on taxes, insurance, interest and
mortgage indebtedness. Held:
(1) An emergency existed furnishing proper occasion for exertion of the reserved power of the State to protect the vital interests
of the community. P. 444.
(2) The findings of emergency by legislature and state supreme
court can not be regarded as subterfuge or as lacking adequate
basis, but are, indeed, supported by facts of which this Court takes
judicial notice. P. 444.
(3) The legislation was addressed to a legitimate end, i.e., it
was not for the advantage of particular individuals but for the
protection of the basic interest of society. P. 445.
(4) In view of the nature of the contracts affected-mortgages
of unquestionable validity-the relief would not be justified by the
emergency, but would contravene the contract clause of the Constitution, if it were not appropriate to the emergency and granted
only upon reasonable conditions. P. 445.
(5) The conditions upon which the period of redemption was
extended do not appear to be unreasonable. The initial 30 day
extension is to give opportunity for the application to the court.
The integrity of the mortgage indebtedness is not impaired;
interest continues to run; the validity of the sale and the right
of the mortgagee-purchaser to title or to obtain a deficiency judgment, if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the extended period,
are maintained; and the conditions of redemption, if redemption
there be, stand as under the prior law. The mortgagor in possession must pay the rental value of the premises as ascertained
in judicial proceedings, and this amount is applied in the carrying
of the property and to interest upon the indebtedness. The
mortgagee-purchaser thus is not left without compensation for
the withholding of possession. P. 445.
(6) Important to the question of reasonableness is the fact, shown
by official reports of which the Court takes judicial notice, that
mortgagees in Minnesota are, predominantly, not home owners or
farmers, but are corporations concerned chiefly with the reasonable protection of their investment security. The legislature was
entitled to deal with this general or typical situation, though there
may be individual cases of another aspect. P. 445.
(7) The relief afforded by the statute has regard to the interest
of mortgagees as well as to the interest of mortgagors. P. 446.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

290 U.S.

(8) The procedure and relief provided are cognate to the historic exercise of equitable jurisdiction in cases of mortgage foreclosure. P. 446.
(9) Since the contract clause is not an absolute and utterly
unqualified restriction of the States' protective power, the legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the legislative competency. P. 447.
(10) The legislation is temporary in operation-limited to the
emergency. The period of postponement to May, 1935, may be
reduced by order of the state court, under the statute, in case of
change of circumstances; and the operation of the statute itself
could not validly outlast the emergency or be so extended as
virtually to destroy contracts. P. 447.
(11) Whether the legislation is wise or unwise as a matter of
policy, does not concern the Court. P. 447.
(12) For tle same reasons that sustain it under the contract
clause, the legislation, as applied in this case, is consistent with
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 448.
(13) The statute does not deny the equal protection of the
laws; its classification is not arbitrary. P. 448.

statute through which this relief was sought by the mortgagors was at first adjudged to be unconstitutional by the

court. The present appeal, by the mortgagee, is from
the second decision of that court, sustaining the trial
court's final order.
APPEAL

Messrs. Alfred W. Bowen and Karl H. Covell for appellant.

If this extension be valid, succeeding legislatures may
prolong it indefinitely, and convert the relation of mortgagee and mortgagor into that of landlord and tenant-the

tenant owning the title.
The Act clearly shows its intention to protect the
ownership of real property in Minnesota at all hazards.

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

403

Argument for Appellant.

By no stretch can it be imagined that the mere recital
of the economic depression indicates an intention to cure
the depression. Neither the conditions recited nor those
actually prevailing approach in severity the conditions
that prevailed throughout this Nation prior to the adoption of the contract clause--conditions judicially noticed
in Edward v. Kearzey, 96 U.S. 595. Rather, this recital
in the Act is made solely to identify the cause of the landowners' present condition. And it is this condition only
that the legislature seeks to remedy.
Practically, the Act defeats this purpose, because it
aggravates the depression from which the landowners'
condition is said to result. It tends naturally and inevitably to restrict -the extension of credit on real estate
security in Minnesota, and thus (a) to increase foreclosures by discouraging loans or renewals; (b) to decrease
employment of labor and the purchase and use of building materials, because prospective builders can not borrow to improve real estate; and (c) to freeze assets and
deposits in banks and other institutions which would
otherwise become liquid by payment of old loans from
new loans.
The Supreme Court of Minnesota agrees that the Act
tends to restrict credit. In the majority opinion, the
court said: "It tends to withdraw from the borrower the
funds which otherwise he might procure. Lenders will
not loan their money in a State where the contract for
its repayment may be impaired at the uncontrolled whim
of its legislature."
The results so predicted by the court have followed
swiftly and irresistibly. During the short time since the
passage of the Act, new construction in Minneapolis and
throughout the State has fallen off enormously.
The Act is diametrically opposed to the present programs of national and state governments generally, to
remedy present conditions by encouraging the extension

290 U.S.

of credit, re-employment, and the buying and use of commodities, including building materials. In view of the
premises, it can not be said with any degree of accuracy
or reason that the Act operates for the welfare of the State
as a whole, or of all of its people, or even of the particular class of debtors intended to be benefited by it.
That such a law is repugnant to the contract clause, and
to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
has been determined by this Court in the following decisions: Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311; Howard v. Bugbee,
24 How. 461; Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U.S. 118. See also
McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608; Gantly v. Ewing,
3 How. 707; Walker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314; Edwards
v. Kearzey, 96 U.S. 595; Daniels v. Tearney, 102 U.S. 415;
McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U.S. 662.
The remedies provided in the contract were a part of it,
both those expressly stated and those implied by virtue of
the then existing state law.
The statute impairs the obligation of the contract and
takes property without due process of law, because it
arbitrarily changes the agreed remedy of foreclosure by
advertisement into foreclosure by action in the courts, and
subjects the mortgagee to future action by the court. It
extends the redemption period from one year to three
years. The irrevocable vesting in appellant of the fee
title to the property was prevented on May 2, 1933, and
since that date; also by virtue of the Act, the appellant's
title is not one in fee absolute, as expressly agreed by the
parties, but is merely a defeasible title, subject to redemption at any time during the additional two-year period by
the mortgagors. This arbitrary cutting down of the
appellant's estate and enlargement of the mortgagors'
estate is contrary to the express terms of the contract.
Moreover, appellant's possession, use and dominion over
its own property were thus denied and will continue to be
denied until May 1, 1935.

HOME BLDG. &L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.

405

Argument for Appellant.

There is nothing before this Court to show that the
existence of the State is threatened. The claim that the
police power is beyond all limitations in the Federal Constitution is so extravagant as hardly to merit consideration. It flies directly in the face of innumerable decisions
of this Court. Moreover, the contrary is twice admittedfirst, in admitting that in normal times the Act would be
void because violating the Federal Constitution; and second, in arguing that the emergency justifies the Act and
frees the police power of the restraints otherwise imposed
by the Constitution.
The appellant does not admit that the economic depression constitutes an emergency; nor that the emergency, if
any, is of the character recognized by this Court in the
Rent Cases as one which would suspend the limitations of
the Federal Constitution.
The statute denies equal protection of the laws to creditors like appellant, and also to debtors. It discriminates
against creditors who have resort to real estate security.
It discriminates against debtors who have not given such
security or who have no real property out of which satisfaction of the debt can be exacted.
This Court, in the earlier cases, did not make any
express reservation in favor of the police power, in emergencies or otherwise; nor can any such implied reservation be claimed, because the mortgage moratorium laws
and stay laws there involved were enacted in the exercise
of the police power, and during economic depressions. It
was the intention of the framers of the Constitution that,
under depression conditions like those now prevailing,
laws of this type should be forever prohibited, whether
enacted under the police power or any other power.

declared void by this Court.

It can not be denied that many provisions of the Federal
Constitution limit the police power. The contract clause,
the due process clause, and the equal protection clause
all are such limitations. It is clear, and has been expressly decided, that the power of taxation is so limited;
and that the power of eminent domain is so limited,
Iowa Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U.S. 239;
Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., 196
U.S. 239; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Morristown, 276
U.S. 182. The court below and the appellees concede that
the police power is so limited. But they assert that the
" emergency" suspends the limitations. This Court has
stated positively and squarely, in a case involving an
actual emergency arising during the Civil War, that even
the war power of the Federal Government is not without
limitations, and that such an emergency does not suspend
constitutional limitations and guaranties. Ex parte
Milligan, 4 Wall. 2.
This Court has the power, in the case at bar, to review
the legislative declarations: (a) as to the existence of
emergency, because its existence is the basis upon which
the validity of Chapter 339 depends; and (b) as to the
existence and extent of the "public interest "; Chastleton
Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, 262 U.S. 522; (c) to ascertain whether the
object comes within the legitimate scope of the police
power; (d) to ascertain whether the classification, if any,
is reasonable and proper, Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v.
Coleman, 277 U.S. 32; (e) to ascertain whether the rules
and standards provided, if any, are reasonably definite
and certain; and (f) to ascertain whether the extent and
effect of the legislation are such as reasonably and properly to accomplish a legitimate object within the police
power.
Limitations on the police power, as on all other powers
of the state governments, are imposed both by the Fed-

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.

eral Constitution, as shown above, and by the state constitutions. Determination by the legislature of what
constitutes proper exercise of police power is not final or
conclusive, but is subject to supervision by the courts.
Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U.S. 504; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial
Court, 262 U.S. 522.
The relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee arising
out of the business of lending money on the credit of real
estate, and the enforcement of the agreed remedies, are
clearly private matters and are not "affected with a public interest."
The Rent Cases went to the extreme in sustaining as
valid the exercise of the police power therein involved.
Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393
and Frost Trucking Co. v. RailroadComm'n, 271 U.S. 583.
The rent laws were upheld only because there was presented the following combination of circumstances:
(a) An emergency was declared by the legislature and
found by the court to exist; (b) the duration of the laws
was limited to the estimated duration of the emergency;
(c) there was, in fact and in law, no deprivation of property without due process of law, because the landlords
and owners were assured a reasonable compensation; (d)
reasonable and definite standards and rules were provided
to accomplish such object; and (e) the legislation applied
to residential property only.
Aside from the legislative declaration, there is nothing
before the Court in this case to show the existence of any
emergency, nor any rational basis for the period of two
years prescribed in the Act. Moreover, there is no reasonable compensation, and in many cases absolutely no
compensation, for mortgagees and other creditors under
the Act. There are no reasonable and definite standards
for applying it. It is not merely for the protection of
residences, that is, homesteads as such, but applies indis-

criminately to all real property, whether vacant, unimproved, agricultural or urban, and whether used for
purposes of residence, investment, or speculation.
It conclusively appears that, in the Rent Cases, the
exercise by the landlords of their rights and remedies to
terminate leases and to recover possession of the premises,
was, under the circumstances: (1) not contemplated by
the parties, at least, not by the tenants; (2) not usual;
(3) not agreed between the parties, or if agreed, agreed
in many cases under duress and coercion; (4) inequitable
and unjust, because the circumstances presented substantially a condition of monopoly in which the tenants, as
parties to the contracts, had little, if any, choice; (5) inimical to society and oppressive because: (a) the rents
charged were flagrantly excessive and extortionate, and
the wholesale evictions were unprecedented in number
and constituted abuse of process; and (b) resulted in
serious and actual injury to the public health, safety and
morals.
in the case at bar, on the other hand, the exercise by the
mortgagees of their rights and remedies in foreclosing the
mortgages, are: (1) contemplated by the parties; (2)
usual; (3) freely agreed between the parties, under no
coercion of person or circumstance; (4) fair; (5) not
inimical to society; and are lawful in all things: (a)
there are no excessive charges, no profiteering or extortion,
no abuse of process, and (b) no menace or injury to the
public health, safety or morals.
The real basis and controlling reason for upholding the
rent laws was that they restrained and prevented inequitable and oppressive conduct by the landlords, and
that such conduct was in fact injurious to the public
health, safety and morals, and that to prevent and cure
all these evils, the business of letting dwellings was regulated under the police power by fixing a reasonable compensation, i.e., rates, and preventing the exercise of the

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

409

Argument for Appellees.

agreed remedies, because under the circumstances, they
were inequitable and an abuse of process. This is eminently proper, for such conduct is always subject to the
police power. No provision of the Federal Constitution,
whether contract clause, due process clause, or any other
restraint on the States, limits or is intended to limit the
police power of the States when exercised for such
purposes.
Mr. HarryH. Peterson,Attorney General of Minnesota,
and Mr. William S. Ervin, Assistant Attorney General,
with whom Mr. George T. Simpson was on the brief, for
appellees.
Every contract is entered into subject to the implied
limitation that in an emergency its terms may be varied
in a reasonable manner under the exercise of the police
power of the State. This limitation upon contract rights
is as much a part of any contract as if it were incorporated
therein in writing.
This law does not impair the contract obligation nor
deprive of property without due process. It provides for
an orderly proceeding to determine what extension, if any,
should be made, the amount which must be paid and the
other conditions which must be performed as a condition
precedent in the making and continuance of the
extension.
We concede that in normal times and under normal
conditions the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Law
would be unconstitutional. But these are not normal
times nor normal conditions. A great economic emergency has arisen in which the State has been compelled
to invoke the police power to protect its people in the
possession and ownership of their homes and farms and
other real estate from the disastrous effects of the wholesale foreclosure of real estate mortgages which inevitably
resulted from the present state-wide, nation-wide, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Appellees.

290 U.S.

world-wide economic depression. General conditions
resulting from this depression are well known.
One of the major problems arising out of the depression
is the proper handling of mortgage. debts. This problem
has been particularly acute in Minnesota because of the
fact that it is an agricultural State and the income of the
majority of our people comes from land. Most of the
real estate mortgages existing were contracted when the
general price level was about twice, and the farm values
about four times, as high as they are today. At the time
of the passage of this law, real estate had practically
ceased to have a market value and could scarcely be sold
at any price, and the income from real estate was not
sufficient in many instances to pay the interest on the
mortgage and the taxes on the land. Our people, with
their savings tied up in closed banks, with their earning
power greatly reduced or entirely wiped out, were unable
to make the payments on their mortgages as they became
due. And they could not refinance their loans or sell
their properties so as to realize something out of their
equities. Consequently, mortgage foreclosures multiplied until, in the Spring of 1933, they reached an all-time
high level. The throwing upon the market of these mortgaged premises had the inevitable effect of further depreciating real estate values throughout -the State. It is
obvious that if these foreclosures had been allowed to
continue and to increase in number, unrestricted and unabated, a large portion of the homes and farms of the
people of this State would inevitably have become the
property of trust companies, banks, insurance companies
and other mortgagees.
For several months prior to the passage of the Act
many serious breaches of the peace occurred from time to
time throughout the State, especially in the rural districts, in connection with mortgage foreclosure sales, and
in many instances these sales were interrupted and pre-

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.

Argument for Appellees.

vented by mobs of people, otherwise peaceful and law
abiding, who had been driven to desperation by the fear
of losing their homes. In some instances mobs compris*ing more than a thousand people gathered together and
forcibly prevented the holding of foreclosure sales. These
disturbances increased in violence and in number until
the Governor of the State, in the interest of preserving
the public peace and the safety of the community, was
compelled to issue an executive order directing sheriffs to
refrain from foreclosing mortgages on homes until the legislature had an opportunity to pass a relief measure to
cope with the emergency.
Unfortunately there are many home and farm owners
in Minnesota who can not get any relief from this law
because the burden of mortgage indebtedness on their
land is too great. However, there are many mortgagors
in this State who, if allowed to retain possession and ownership, will be able to save them, if economic conditions
improve within a reasonable period of time. In the past
history of this country depressions have come, run their
course of one year, or a few years, and then normally
prosperous times have returned. May we not expect this
depression, although more intense and wider in scope, to
run a similar course? This law will enable many owners
of mortgaged real estate to retain the ownership and possession of their real estate until such time as economic
conditions improve and real estate again has a market
value, so that loans can be refinanced or real estate sold
at normal prices. Moreover, the National Government
has passed laws providing for the making of loans. to
owners of farms and homes, and when these laws are put
into full operation many mortgagors will be able to refinance their loans through the Government.
The early decisions of the federal courts quite generally
limited the exercise by the State of its police power to
matters affecting the public health, public morals and

public safety; but in the last half century this limitation
has been abandoned and these courts, as well as many of
the state courts, have enlarged by judicial interpretation
the scope of this power to meet the requirements of
changing economic and industrial conditions and the
growth of the States and the Nation. It is now, we think,
the consensus of the judicial opinion that the State may
exercise its police power not only for the promotion and
protection of the public health, public morals and public
safety, but also to promote the wealth and prosperity, the
comfort, convenience, and happiness-in short, the generrl welfare-of the State. Black, Constitutional Law,

ment of those laws grew out of housing conditions existing in the District of Columbia and a few cities in the
State of New York, shortly after the World War, in a
period of prosperity. The present emergency is based
on an economic depression of unparalleled magnitude and
severity, which exists not only in Minnesota and in the
United States, but in the whole civilized world.
At the time of the emergency in the Rent Cases, there
was a job for every man who would wcrk, and there was
a living wage for labor. Houses were scarce, to be sure,
and rents were high, but men were not starving and
freezing.
Compare the situation in Minnesota. Many of our
farmers have lost, or are in danger of losing, their homes
by tax sales or mortgage foreclosures, and the prices of
farm products will scarcely pay taxes and interest. The
home-owners of the, cities are in no better plight; they
can not find employment; their small reserves are exhausted; the banks that held the savings of many of them
are closed. In addition there is the ever present menacing danger of wide-spread rioting and lawlessness by people otherwise peaceful and law-abiding, about to be rendered homeless and shelterless.

constitutional: Gibbes v. Zimmerman, 290 U.S. 326; New

legislation. In fact, should the emergency cease to exist
before the expiration of the time of operation provided
for in the Act, the Act would immediately become void
and inoperative. Its validity at all times depends upon
the continued existence of the emergency. Chastleton
Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543.
The police power of the State is vested in the legislature, which has the duty and responsibility of determining when the emergency exists and how it will be met.
When pursuant to such determination a law is passed, the
courts should not set aside that law unless it has no real
or substantial relation to the emergency. Mugler v.
Kansas, 123 U. S. 623; Atkin v. Kansas, 191 U.S. 207, 223;
Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 31; People v.
LaFetra, 230 N.Y. 429, 440; Guttag v. Shatzkin, 230
N.Y. 647.
To show the practical construction that legislative
bodies and executives have been placing upon their powers
to act in emergencies which have recently arisen out of the
Depression, we call attention to the recent mortgage foreclosure moratorium laws passed by the legislatures of
Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Oklahoma; to the
executive orders of the Governors of Minnesota and
North Dakota, imposing moratoriums on mortgage foreclosures; to recent executive orders and legislative acts
closing all the banks in practically every State in the
Union; and finally to the proclamation by the President
closing every bank in the United States, We also call
attention to the moratoriums on insurance loans imposed
by legislative enactments, and by order of insurance commissioners, which affected practically every insurance
company in the United States.
We also call attention to the Acts of Congress declaring
invalid all provisions in contracts in so far as payment is
required to be made in gold, and to the National Industrial Recovery Act by which Congress virtually placed

commerce and industry under the supervision and control
of the United States Government. These moratoriums
and other similar measures all interfered with contract
rights. In practically every case the interference with
contract rights was considerably more sweeping and farreaching than is the interference with contract rights
under the provisions of the law now in question.
Courts of equity have always possessed a jurisdiction
to relieve against penalties and forfeitures, which necessarily abridged the contractual and property rights of one
of the parties under the strict wording of their contract.
In the present economic crisis the courts have not hesitated to extend and use their equitable powers. See:
Suring State Bank v. Giese, 246 N.W. 556; First Union
Trust Savings Bank v. Division State Bank, Cook County
Circuit Court, April 1, 1933; Harry Kresner, Inc. v.
Fuchs, 262 N.Y.S. 669; N. J. National Bank & Trust Co.
v. Lincoln Mortgage Title & G. Co., 105 N. J. Eq. 557.
The Minnesota law does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Magoun v.
Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U.S. 283; Quong Wing
v. Kirkendall, 223 U.S. 59; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v.
May, 194 U.S. 267; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U.S.
138; Miller v. Wilson, 236 U.S. 373; Marcus Brown Holding Co.,v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170.
The provisions of the Minnesota law are severable, and
for that reason the Court is not called upon to determine
the constitutionality of those parts which have no bearing on the case at bar, and moot questions are not properly before the Court.

as being repugnant to the contract clause (Art. I, § 10)
,and the due process and equal protection clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution.
The statute was sustained by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, 189 Minn. 422, 448; 249 N.W. 334, 893, and the
case comes here on appeal.
The Act provides that, during the emergency declared
to exist, relief may be had through authorized judicial proceedings with respect to foreclosures of mortgages, and
execution sales, of real estate; that sales may be postponed and periods of redemption may be extended. The
Act does not apply to mortgages subsequently made nor
to those made previously which shall be extended for a
period ending more than a year after the passage of the
Act (Part One, § 8). There are separate provisions in
Part Two relating to homesteads, but these are to apply
"only to cases not entitled to relief under some valid provision of Part One." The Act is to remain in effect "only
during the continuance of the emergency and in no event
beyond May 1, 1935." "No extension of the period for redemption and no postponement of sale is to be allowed
which would have the effect of extending the period of
redemption beyond that date. Part Two, § 8.
The Act declares that the various provisions for relief
are severable; that each is to stand on its own footing
with respect to validity. Part One, § 9. We are here
concerned with the provisions of Part One, § 4, authorizing the District Court of the county to extend the period
of redemption from foreclosure sales "for such additional
time as the court may deem just and equitable," subject
to the above described limitation. The extension is to be
made upon application to the court, on notice, for an order
determining the reasonable value of the incorlie on the
property involved in the sale, or if it has no income, then
the reasonable rental value of the property, and directing
the mortgagor "to pay all or a reasonable part of such

income or rental value, in or toward the payment of taxes,
insurance, interest, mortgage .

times and in such manner" as shall be determined by the
court.1 The section also provides that the time for re'That section is as follows:
"See. 4. Period of Redemption May be Extended.-Where any
mortgage upon real property has been foreclosed and the period of
redemption has not yet expired, or where a sale is hereafter had, in
the case of real estate mortgage foreclosure proceedings, now pending,
or which may hereafter be instituted prior to the expiration of two
years from and after the passage of this Act, or upon the sale of any
real property under any judgment or execution where the period of
redemption has not yet expired, or where such sale is made hereafter
within two years from and after the passage of this Act, the period
of redemption may be extended for such additional time as the court
may deem just and equitable but in no event beyond May 1st, 1935;
provided that the mortgagor, or the owner in possession of said property, in the case of mortgage foreclosure proceedings, or the judgment debtor, in case of sale under judgment, or execution, shall prior
to the expiration of the period of redemntion, apply to the district
court having jurisdiction of the matter, on not less than 10 days'
written notice to the mortgagee or judgment creditor, or the attorney
of either, as the case may be, for an order determining the reasonable
value of the income on said property, or, if the property has no
income, then the reasonable rental value of the property involved in
such sald, and directing and requiring such mortgagor or judgment
debtor, to pay all or a reasonable part of such income or rental
value, in or toward the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, mortgage or judgment indebtedness at such times and in such manner as
shall be fixed and determined and ordered by the court; and the court
shall thereupon hear said application and after such hearing shall
make and file its order directing the payment by such mortgagor,
or judgment debtor, of such an amount at such times and in such
manner as to the court shall, under all the circumstances, appear just
and equitable. Provided that upon the service of the notice or demand aforesaid that the running of the period of redemption shall be
tolled until the court shall make its order upon such application.
Provided, further, however, t6hat if such mortgagor or judgment
debtor, or personal representative, shall default in the payments, or
any of them, in such order required, on his part to be done, or commits waste, his right to redeem from said sale shall terminate 30 days

demption from foreclosure sales theretofore made, which
otherwise would expire less than thirty days after the
approval of the Act shall be extended to a date thirty
days after its approval, and application may be made to
the court within that time for a further extension as provided in the section. By another provision of the Act,
no action, prior to May 1, 1935, may be maintained for
a deficiency judgment until the period of redemption as
allowed by existing law or as extended under the provisions of the Act has expired. Prior to the expiration of
the extended period of redemption the court may revise
or alter the terms of the extension as changed circumstances may require. Part One, § 5.
Invoking the relevant provision of the statute, appellees
applied to the District Court of Hennepin County for an
order extending the period of redemption from a foreclosure sale. Their petition stated that they owned a lot
after such default and holders of subsequent liens may redeem in the
order and manner now provided by law beginning 30 days after the
filing of notice of such default with the clerk of such District Court,
and his right to possession shall cease and the party acquiring title
to any such real estate shall then be entitled to the immediate possession of said premises. If default is claimed by allowance of waste,
such 30 day period shall not begin to run until the filing of 9n order
of the court finding such waste. Provided, further, that the time of
redemption from any real estate mortgage foreclosure or judgment
or execution sale heretofore made, which otherwise would expire less
than 30 days after the passage and approval of this Act, shall be and
the same hereby is extended to a date 30 days after the passage and
approval of this Act, and in such case, the mortgagor, or judgment
debtor, or the assigns or personal representative of either, as the
case may be, or the owner in the possession of the property, may,
prior to said date, apply to said court for and the court may thereupon grant the relief as hereinbefore and. in this section provided.
Provided, further, that prior to May 1, 1935, no action shall be
maintained in this state for a deficiency'judgment until the period of
redemption as allowed by existing law or as extended under the
provisions of this Act, has expired."

in Minneapolis which they had mortgaged to appellant;
that the mortgage contained a valid power of sale by
advertisement and that by reason of their default the
mortgage had been foreclosed and sold to appellant on
May 2, 1932, for $3700.98; that appellant was the holder
of the sheriff's certificate of sale; that because of the
economic depression appellees had been unable to obtain
a new loan or to redeem, and that unless the period of
redemption were extended the property would be irretrievably lost; and that the reasonable yalue of the property greatly exceeded the amount due on the mortgage
including all liens, costs and expenses.
On the hearing, appellant objected to the introduction
of evidefice upon the ground that the statute was invalid
under the federal and state constitutions, and moved that
the petition be dismissed. The motion was granted and a
motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State reversed the decision of the District Court. 189 Minn. 422; 249 N.W. 334. Evidence
was then taken in the trial court and appellant renewed
its constitutional objections without avail. The court
made findings of fact setting forth the mortgage made by
the appellees on August 1, 1928, the power of sale contained in the mortgage, the default and foreclosure by advertisement, and the sale to appellant on May 2, 1932,
for $3700.98. The court found that the time to redeem
would expire on May 2, 1933, under the laws of the State
as they were in effect when the mortgage was made and
when it was foreclosed; that the reasonable value of the
income on the property, and the reasonable rental value,
was $40 a month; that the bid made by appellant on the
foreclosure sale, and the purchase price, were the full
amount of the mortgage indebtedness, and that there was
no deficiency after the sale; that the reasonable present
market value of the premises was $6000; and that the

total amount of the purchase price, with taxes and insurance premiums subsequently paid by appellant, but exclusive of interest from the date of sale, was $4056.39.
The court also found that the property was situated in
the closely built-up portions of Minneapolis; that it had
been improved by a two-car garage, together with a building two stories in height which was divided into fourteen
rooms; that the appellees, husband and wife, occupied the
premises as their homestead, occupying three rooms and
offering the remaining rooms for rental to others.
The court entered its judgment extending the period
of redemption to May 1, 1935, subject to the condition
that the appellees should pay to the appellant $40 a
month through the extended period from May 2, 1933,
that is, that in each of the months of August, September,
and October, 1933, the payments should be $80, in two
instalments, and thereafter $40 a month, all these
amounts to go to the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, and mortgage indebtedness.' It is this judgment,
sustained by the Supreme Court of the State on the authority of its former opinion, which is here under review.
189 Minn. 448; 249 N.W. 893.
The state court upheld the statute as an emergency
measure. Although conceding that the obligations of the
mortgage contract were impaired, the court decided that
what it thus described as an impairment was, notwithstanding the contract clause of the Federal Constitution,
within the police power of the State as that power was
called into exercise by the public economic emergency
which the legislature had found to exist. Attention is
thus directed to the preamble and first section of the
'A joint statement of the counsel for both parties, filed with the
court on the argument in this Court, shows that, after pioviding for
taxes, insurance, and interest, and crediting the payments to be made
by the mortgagor under the judgment, the amount necessary to
redeem May 1, 1935, would be $4,258.82.

'The preamble and the first section of the Act are as follows:
"Whereas, the severe financial and economic depression existing for
several years past has resulted in extremely low prices for the products of the farms and the factories, a great amount of unemployment,
an almost complete lack of credit for farmers, business men and
property owners and a general and extreme stagnation of business,
agriculture and industry, and
"Whereas, many owners of real property, by reason of said conditions, are unable, and it is believed, will for some time be unable to
meet all payments as they come due of taxes, interest and principal
of mortgages on their properties and are, therefore, threatened with
loss of such properties through mortgage foreclosure and judicial sales
thereof, and
"Whereas, many such properties have been and are being bid in at
mortgage foreclosure and execution sales for prices much below what
is believed to be their real values and often for much less than'the
mortgage or judgment indebtedness, thus entailing deficiency judgments against the mortgage and judgment debtors, and
"Whereas, it is believed, and the Legislature of Minnesota hereby
declares its belief, that the conditions existing as hereinbefore set forth
has created an emergency of such nature that justifies and validates
legislation for the extension of the time of redemption from mortgage
foreclosure and execution sales and other relief of a like character;
and
"Whereas, The State of Minnesota possesses the right under its
police power to declare a state of emergency to exist, and
"Whereas, the inherent and fundamental purpose of our government is to safeguard the public and promote the general welfare of

could not say that this legislative finding was without
basis, supplemented that finding by its own statement of
conditions of which it took judicial notice. The court
said:
"In addition to the weight to be given the determination of the legislature that an economic emergency exists
which demands relief, the court must take notice of other
considerations. The members of the legislature come
from every community of the state and from all the walks
of life. They are familiar with conditions generally in
every calling, occupation, profession, and business in the
state. Not only they, but the courts must be guided by
what is common knowledge. It is common knowledge
that in the last few years land values have shrunk enormously. Loans made a few years ago upon the basis of
the then going values cannot possibly be replaced on the
basis of present values. We all know that when this law'
was enacted the large financial companies, which had
made it their business to invest in mortgages, had ceased
to do so. No bank would directly or indirectly loan on
real estate mortgages. Life insurance companies, large
investors in such mortgages, had even declared a moratorium as to the loan provisions of their policy contracts.
The President had closed banks temporarily. The Con-,
may be had or postponed and jurisdiction to administer equitable
relief in connection therewith may be conferred upon the District

Court, and
"Whereas, Mason's Minnesota Statutes of 1927, Section 9608, which
provides for the postponement of mortgage foreclosure sales, has remained for more than thirty years, a provision of the statutes in contemplation of which provisions for foreclosure by advertisement have

gress, in addition to, r-any extraordinary measures looking to the relief of the economic emergency, had passed an
act to supply funds whereby mortgagors may be able
within a reasonable time to refinance their mortgages or
redeem from sales where the redemption has not
expired. With this knowledge the court cannot well hold
that the legislature had no basis in fact for the conclusion that an economic emergency existed which called for
the exercise of the police power to grant relief." [189
Minn. 429; 249 N.W. 336.]
Justice Olsen of the state court, in a concurring opinion,
added the following:
"The present nation wide and world wide business and
financial crisis has the same results as if it were caused by
flood, earthquake, or disturbance in nature. It has deprived millions of persons in this nation of their employment and means of earning a living for themselves and
their families; it has destroyed the value of and the income from all property on which thousands of people depended for a living; it actually has resulted in the loss of
their homes by a number of our people and threatens to
result in the loss of their homes by many other people,
in this state; it has resulted in such widespread want and
suffering among our people that private, state, and municipal agencies are unable to adequately relieve the want
and suffering, and congress has found it necessary to step
in and attempt to remedy the situation by federal aid.

We approach the questions thus presented upon the
assumption made below, as required by the law of the
State, that the mortgage contained a valid power of sale
to be exercised in case of default; that this power was
validly exercised; that under the law then applicable the
period of redemption from the sale was one year and that
it has been extended by the judgment of the court over
the opposition of the mortgagee-purchaser; and that during the period thus extended, and unless the order for
extension is modified, the mortgagee-purchaser will be
unable to obtain possession, or to obtain or convey title
in fee, as he would have been able to do had the, statute
their products to support their families, and pay taxes and interest
on the mortgages on their homes. In the fall and winter of 1932 in
the villages and small cities where most of the farmers must market
their produce, -corn was quoted as low as eight cents per bushel, oats
two cents and wheat twenty-nine cents per bushel, eggs at seven
cents per dozen and butter at ten cents per pound. The industry
second in importance is mining. In normal times Minnesota produces
about sixty per cent of the iron of the United States and nearly
thirty per cent of all the iron produced in the world. In 1932 the
production of iron fell to less than fifteen per cent of normal production. The families of idle miners soon became destitute and had
to be supported by public funds. Other industries of the state, such
as lumbering and the manufacture of wood products, the manufacture of farm machinery and various goods of steel and iron have
also been affected disastrously by the depression. Because of the
increased burden on the state and its political subdivisions which
resulted from the depression, taxes on lands, which provide by far
the major portion of the taxes in this state, were increased to such
an extent that in many instances they became confiscatory. Tax
delinquencies were alarmingly great, rising as high as 78% in one
county of the state. In seven counties of the state the tax delinquency was over 50%. Because of these delinquencies many towns,
school districts, villages and cities were practically bankrupt. In
many of these political subdivisions of the state local government
would have ceased to function and would have collapsed had it not
been for loans from the state." The Attorney General also stated
that serious breaches of the peace had occurred.

not been enacted. The statute does not impair the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness. The obligation for
interest remains. The statute does not affect the validity
of the sale or the right of a mortgagee-purchaser to title
in fee, or his right to obtain a deficiency judgment, if the
mortgagor fails to redeem within the prescribed period.
Aside from the extension of time, the other conditions of
redemption are unaltered. While the mortgagor remains
in possession he must pay the rental value as that value
has been determined, upon notice and hearing, by the
court. The rental value so paid is devoted to the carrying of the property by the application of the required
payments to taxes, insurance, and interest on the mortgage indebtedness, While the mortgagee-purchaser is
debarred from actual possession, he has, so far as rental
value is concerned, the equivalent of possession during
the extended period.
In determining whether the provision for this temporary and conditional relief exceeds the power of the State
by reason of the clause in the Federal Constitution prohibiting impairment of the obligations of contracts, we
must consider the relation of emergency to constitutional
power, the historical setting of, the contract clause, the
development of the jurisprudence of this Court in the construction of that clause, and the principles of construction which we may consider to be established.
Emergency does not create power. Emergency does
not increase granted power or remove or diminish the
restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved.
The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency. Its grants of power to the Federal Government
and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they are not
altered by emergency. What power was thus granted
and what limitations were thus imposed are questions

which have always been, and always will be, the subject
of close examination under our constitutional system.
While emergency does not create power, emergency may
furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. "Although
an emergency may not call into life a power which has
never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason
for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed." Wilson v. New, 243 U.S. 332, 348. The constitutional question presented in the light of an emergency is whether
the power possessed embraces the particular exercise of it
in response to particular conditions. Thus, the war power
of the Federal Government is not, created by the emergency of war, but it is a power given to meet that emergency. It is a power to wage war successfully, and thus
it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the
people in a supreme coperative effort to preserve the
nation. But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties.'
When the provisions of the Constitution, in grant or
restriction, are specific, so particularized as not to admit
of construction, no question is presented. Thus, emergency would not permit a State to have more than two
Senators in the Congress, or permit thQ election of President by a general popular vote without regard to the
number of electors to which the States are respectively
entitled, or permit the States to "coin money" or to
"make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts." But where constitutional grants and
limitations of-power are set forth in general clauses, which
afford a broad outline, the process of construction is essential to fill in the details. - That is true of the contract
clause. The necessity of construction is not obviated by
"See Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120-127; United States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623, 627; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146, 155; United States v. Cohen Grocery Co.,

the fact that the contract clause is associated in the same
section with other and more specific prohibitions. Even
the grouping of subjects in the same clause may not require the same application to each of the subjects, regardless of differences in their nature. See Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505; Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers V. United
States, 286 U.S. 427, 434.
In the construction of the contract clause, the debates
in the Constitutional Convention are of little aid.' But
the reasons which led to the adoption of that clause, and
of the other prohibitions of Section 10 of Article I, are
*not left in doubt and have frequently been described
with eloquent emphasis.7 The widespread distress following the revolutionary period, and the plight of debtors, had called forth in the States an ignoble Rrray of
legislative schemes for the defeat of creditors and the invasion of contractual obligations. Legislative interferences had been so numerous and extreme that the confidence essential to prosperous trade had been undermined
and the utter destruction of credit was threatened. "The
sober people of America" were convinced that some
" thorough reform " was needed which would "inspire a
general prudence and industry, and give a regular course
to the business of society." The Federalist, No. 44. It
was necessary to interpose the restraining power of a central authority in order to secure the foundations even of

the contract clause are summed up in the terse statement
of Chief Justice Marshall in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat.
pp. 213, 354, 355: "The power of changing the relative
situation of debtor and creditor, of interfering with contracts, a power which comes home to every man, touches
the interest of all, and controls the conduct of every individual in those things which he supposes to be proper for
his own exclusive management, had been used to such an
excess by the state legislatures, as to break in upon the
ordinary intercourse of society, and destroy all confidence
between man and man. This mischief had become so
great, so alarming, as not only to impair commercial intercourse, and threaten the existence of credit, but to sap
the morals of the people, and destroy the sanctity of
private faith. To guard against the continuance of the
evil was an object of deep interest with all the truly
wise, as well as the virtuous, of this great community, and
was one of the important benefits expected from a reform
of the government."
But full recognition of the occasion and general purpose
of the clause does not suffice to fix its precise scope. Nor
does an examination of the details of prior legislation in
the States yield criteria which can be considered controlling. To ascertain the scope of the constitutional prohibition we examine the course of judicial decisions in its
application. These put it beyond question that the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with
literal exactness like a mathematical formula. Justice
Johnson, in Ogden v. Saunders, supra,p. 286, adverted to
such a misdirected effort in these words: "It appears to
me, that a great part of the difficulties of the cause, arise
from not giving sufficient weight to the general intent of
this clause in the constitution, and subjecting it to a severe literal construction, which would be better adapted
to special pleadings." And after giving his view as to the
purport of the clause,-" that the States shall pass no law,

Opinion of the- Court.

attaching to the acts of individuals other effects or consequences than those attached to them by the laws existing
at their date; and all contracts thus construed, shall
be enforced according to their just and reasonable
purport "-Justice Johnson added: ".But to assign to contracts, universally, a literal purport, and to exact for them
a rigid literal fulfillment, could not have been the intent
of the constitution. It is repelled by a hundred examples.
Societies exercise a positive control as well over the inception, construction and fulfillment of contracts, as over the
form and measure of the remedy to enforce them."
The inescapable problems of construction have been:
What is a contract? S What are the obligations of contracts? What constitutes impairment of these obligations? What residuum of power is there still in the States
in relation to the operation of contracts, to protect the
vital interests of the community? Questions of this character, "of no small nicety and intricacy, have vexed the
legislative halls, as well as the judicial tribunals, with an
uncounted variety and frequency of litigation and speculation." Story on the Constitution, § 1375.
The obligation of a contract is "the law which binds
the parties to perform their agreement." Sturges v.
Crowninshield,4 Wheat. 122, 197; Story, op. cit., § 1378.
This Court has said that "the laws which subsist at the
time and place of the making of a contract, and where it
'Contracts, within the meaning of the clause, have been held to embrace those that are executed, that is, grants, as well as those that are
executory. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 137; Terrett v. Taylor,

is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if
they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its
terms. This principle embraces alike those which affect
its validity, construction, discharge and enforcement.
.
. Nothing can be more material to the obligation
than the means of enforcement. . o.
The ideas of

validity and remedy are inseparable, and both are parts
of the obligation, which is guaranteed by the Constitution
against invasion." Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4
Wall. 535, 550, 552. See, also, Walker v. Whitehead, 16
Wall. 314, 317. But this broad language cannot be taken
without qualification. Chief Justice Marshall pointed out
the distinction between obligation and remedy. Sturges v.
Crowninshield, supra,p. 200. Said he: "The distinction
between the obligation of a contract, and the remedy
given by the legislature to enforce that obligation, has
been taken at the bar, and exists in the nature of things.
Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the
remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the
nation shall direct." And in Von Hoffman v. City of
Quincy, supra, pp. 553, 554, the general statement above
quoted was limited by the further observation that "It
is competent for the States to change the form of the
remedy, or to modify it otherwise, as they may see fit,
provided no substantial right secured by the contract is
thereby impaired. No attempt has been made to fix definitely the line between alterations of the remedy, which
are to be deemed legitimate, and those which, under the
form of modifying the remedy, impair substantial rights.
Every case must be determined upon its own circumstances." And Chief Justice Waite, quoting this language in Antoni v. Greenhow, 107 U.S. 769, 775, added:
"In all such cases the question becomes, therefore, one of
reasonableness, and of that the legislature is primarily
the judge."

Opinion of the Court.

The obligations of a contract are impaired by a law
which renders them invalid, or releases or extinguishes
them I (Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, pp. 197, 198)
and impairment, as above noted, has been predicated of
laws which without destroying contracts derogate from
substantial contractual rights.10 In Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, a state insolvent law, which discharged the
debtor from liability was held to be invalid as applied to
contracts in existence when the law was passed. See
Ogden v. Saunders, supra. In Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat.
1, the legislative acts, which were successfully assailed,
exempted the occupant of land from the payment of rents
and profits to the rightful owner and were "parts of a
system the object of which was to compel the rightful
owner to relinquish his lands or pay for all lasting improvements made upon them, without his consent or default." In Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, state legislation, which had been enacted for the relief of debtors in
view of the seriously depressed condition of business,11
following the panic of 1837, and which provided that the
equitable estate of the mortgagor should not be extin'But there is held to be no impairment by a law which removes the
taint of illegality and thus permits enforcement, as, e.g., by the repeal
of a statute making a contract void for usury. Ewell v. Daggs, 108

guished for tWelve months after sale on foreclosure, and
further prevented any sale unless two-thirds of the appraised value of the property should be bid therefor, was
held to violate the constitutional provision. It will be
observed that in the Bronson case, aside from the requirement as to the amount of the bid at the sale, the extension of the period of redemption was unconditional, and
there was no provision, as in the instant case, to secure to
the mortgagee the rental value of the property during the
extended period. McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608,
Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing, 3 How. 707, and Howard v.
Bugbee, 24 How. 461, followed the decision in Bronson v.
Kinzie; that of McCracken, condemning a statute which
provided that an execution sale should not be made of
property unless it would bring two-thirds of its value
according to the opinion of three householders; that of
Gantly's Lessee, condemning a statute which required a
sale for not less than one-half the appraised yalue; and
that of Howard, making a similar ruling as to an unconditional extension of two years for redemption from foreclosure sale. In Planters' Bank v. Sharp, 6 How. 301,
a state law was found to be invalid which prevented a
bank from transferring notes and bills receivable which
it had been duly authorized to acquire. In Von Hoffman
v. City of Quincy, supra, a statute which restricted the
power of taxation which had previously been given to
provide for the payment of municipal bonds was set
aside. Louisianav. Police Jury, 111 U.S. 716, and Seibert
v. Lewis, 122 U.S. 284 are similar cases.
In Walker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314, the statute,
which was held to be repugnant to the contract clause,
was enacted in 1870 and provided that in all suits pending on any debt or contract made before June 1, 1865,
the plaintiff should not have a verdict unless it appeared
that all taxes chargeable by law on the same had been

duly paid for each year since the contract was made; and
further, that in all cases of indebtedness of the described
class the defendant might offset any losses he had suffered
in consequence of the late war either from destruction
or depreciation of property. See Daniels v. Tearney, 102
U.S. 415, 419. In Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610, and
Edwards v. Kearzey, 96 U.S. 595, statutes applicable to
prior contracts were condemned because of increases in the
amount of the property of judgment debtors which were
exempted from levy and sale on excution. But, in
Penniman's Case, 103 U.S. 714, 720, the Court decided
that a statute abolishing imprisonment for debt did not,
within the meaning of the Constitution, impair the obligation of contracts previously made;' 2 and the Court said:
"The general doctrine of this court on this subject may
be thus stated: In modes of proceeding and forms to enforce the contract the legislature has the control, and
may enlarge, limit or alter them, provided it does not
deny a remedy or so embarrass it with conditions or restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right."
In Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U.S. 118, the Court held that
a statute which authorized the redemption of property
sold on foreclosure, where no right of redemption previously existed, or which extended the period of redemption beyond the time formerly allowed, could not constitutionally apply to a sale under a mortgage executed
before its passage. This ruling was to, the same effect as
that in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, and Howard v. Bugbee,
supra. But in the Barnitz case, the statute contained a
provision for the prevention of waste, and authorized
the appointment of a receiver of the premises sold.
Otherwise the extension of the period for redemption
was unconditional, and in case a receiver was appointed,

the income during the period allowed for redemption, except what was necessary for repairs and to prevent waste,
was still to go to the mortgagor.
None of these cases, and we have cited those upon
which appellant chiefly relies, is directly applicable to the
question now before us in view of the conditions with
which the Minnesota statute seeks to safeguard the interests of the mortgagee-purchaser during the extended
period. And broad expressions contained in some of
these opinions went beyond the requirements of the decision, and are not controlling. Cohens v. Virginia, 6
Wheat. 264, 399.

measure of control which the State retains over remedial
processes,"5 but the State also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does

not matter that legislation appropriate to that end "has
the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in
effect." Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U.S. 251, 276. Not
only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix
obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of
essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into
contracts as a postulate of the legal order. The policy of
protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the
maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worth while,-a government which retains adequate authority to secure the peace and good
order of society. This principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of
state power has had progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court.
While the charters of private corporations constitute
contracts, a grant of exclusive privilege is not to be implied as against the State. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420. And all contracts are subject to
the right of eminent domain. West River Bridge v. Dix,
6 How. 507." The reservation of this necessary authority
of the State is deemed to be a part of the contract. In
the case last cited, the Court answered the forcible challenge of the State's power by the following statement of
the controlling principle,-a statement reiterated by this
Court speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer, nearly fifty
years later, in Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn,
166 U.S. 685, 692: " But into all contracts, whether made
between States and individuals, or between individuals
only, there enter conditions which arise not out of the lit",See, also, New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U.S.

eral terms of the contract itself; they are superinduced by
the preexisting and higher authority of the laws of nature,
of nations or of the community to which the parties belong; they are always presumed, and must be presumed,
to be known and recognized by all, are binding upon all,
and need never, therefore, be carried into express stipulation, for this could add nothing to their force. Every
contract is made in subordination to them, and must yield
to their control, as conditions inherent and paramount,
wherever a necessity for their execution shall occur."
The legislature cannot "bargain away the public health
or the public morals." Thus, the constitutional provision
against the impairment of contracts, was held not to be
violated by an amendment of the state constitution which
put an end to a lottery theretofore authorized by the
legislature. Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U.S. 814, 819. See,
also, Douglas v. Kentucky, 168 U.S. 488, 497-499; compare New Orleans v. Houston, 119 U.S. 265, 275. The
lottery was a valid enterprise when established under express state authority, but the legislature in the public
interest could put a stop to it. A similar rule has been
applied to the control by the State of the sale of intoxi-'
cating liquors. Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25, 32,
33; see Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 664, 665. The
States retain adequate power to protect the public health
against the maintenance of nuisances despite insistence
upon existing contracts. Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park,
97 U.S. 659, 667; Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City
Co., 111 U.S. 746, 750. Legislation to protect the public
safety comes within the same category of reserved power.

Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, 232 U.S. 548, 558. This
principle has had recent and noteworthy application to
the regulation of the use of public highways by common
carriers and "contract carriers," where the assertion of

interference with existing contract rights has been without avail. Sproles v. Binford, 286 U.S. 374, 390, 391;
Stephenson v. Bin!ord, supra.
The economic interests of the State may justify the
exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power
notwithstanding interference with contracts. In Manigault v. Springs, 199 U.S. 473, riparian owners in South
Carolina had made a contract for a clear passage through
a creek by the removal of existing obstructions. Later,
the legislature of the State, by virtue of its broad authority to make public improvements, and in order to
increase the taxable value of the lowlands which would
be drained, authorized the construction of a dam across
the creek. The Court sustained the statute upon the
ground that the private interests were subservient to the
public right. The Court said (id., p. 480): " It is ttke
settled law of this court that the interdiction of statutes
impairing the obligation of contracts does not prevent
the State from exercising such powers as are vested in it
for the promotion of the common weal, or are necessary
for the general good of the public, though contracts pre.
viously entered into between individuals may thereby
be affected. This power, which in its various ramifications is known as the police power, is an exercise of th6
sovereign right of the Government to protect the lives,
health, morals, comfort and general welfare of the people,
and is paramount to any rights under contracts between
individuals." A statute of New Jersey prohibiting the
transportation of water of the State into any other State
was sustained against the objection that the statute impaired the obligation of contracts which had been made
for furnishing such water to persons without the State.
Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U.S. 349. Said the
Court, by Mr. Justice Holmes (id., p. 357): "One whose
rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction,
cannot remove them from the power of the State by mak-

290 U.S.

ing a contract about them. The contract will carry with
it the infirmity of the subject matter." The general
authority of the legislature to regulate, and thus to
.modify, the rates charged by public service corporations
affords another illustration. Stone v. Farmers Loan &
Trust Co., 116 U.S. 307, 325, 326. In Union Dry Goods
Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corp., 248 U.S. 372, a statute fixing reasonable rates, to be charged by a corporation for supplying electricity to the inhabitants of a city,
superseded lower rates which had been agreed upon by a
contract previously made for a definite term between the
company and a consumer. The validity of the statute
was sustained. To the same effect are Producers TransportationCo. v. Railroad Comm'n, 251 U.S. 228, 232, and
Sutter Butte Canal Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 279 U.S.
125, 138. Similarly, where the protective power of the
State is exercised in a manner otherwise appropriatein
the regulation of a business it is no objection that the
performance of existing contracts may be frustrated by
the prohibition of injurious practices. Rast v. Van
Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U.S. 342, 363; see, also, St.
Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269,
274.
The argument is pressed that in the cases we have cited
the obligation of contracts was affected only incidentally.
This argument proceeds upon a misconception. The
question is not whether the legislative action affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but whether
the legislation is addressed, to a legitimate end and the
measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that
end. Another argument, which comes more closely to
the point, is that the state power may be addressed directly to the prevention of the enforcement of contracts
only when these are of a sort which the legislature in its
discretion may denounce as being in themselves hostile to
public morals, or public health, safety or welfare, or

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

439

Opinion of the Court.

where the prohibition is merely of injurious practices;
that interference with the enforcement of other and valid
contracti according to appropriate legal procedure, although the interference is temporary and for a public purpose, is not permissible. This is but to contend that in
the latter case the end is not legitimate in the view that
it cannot be reconciled with a fair interpretation of the
constitutional provision.
Undoubtedly, whatever is reserved of state power must
be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power. The reserved power cannot be
construed so as to destroy the limitation, nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its
essential aspects. They must be construed in harmony
with each other. This principle precludes a construction
which would permit the State to adopt as its policy the
repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or
the denial of means to enforce them. But it does not
follow that conditions may not arise in which a temporary
restraint of enforcement may be consistent with the spirit
anl purpose of the constitutional provision and thus be
found to be within the range of the reserved power of the
State to protect the vital interests of the community. It
cannot be maintained that the constitutional prohibition
should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of
contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity
such as fire, flood, or earthquake. See American Land
Co. v. Zeiss, 219 U.S. 47. The reservation of state power
appropriate to such extraordinary conditions may be
deemed to be as much a part of all contracts, as is the
reservation of state power to protect the public interest
in the other situations to which we have referred. And
if state power exists to give temporary relief from the enforcement of contracts in the presence of disasters due to
physical causes such as fire, flood or earthquake, that

290 U.S.

power cannot be said to be non-existent when the urgent
public need demanding such relief is produced by other
and economic causes.
Whatever doubt there may have been that the protective power of the State, its police power, may be exercised-without violating the true intent of the provision
of the Federal Constitution-in directly preventing the
immediate and literal enforcement of contractual obligations, by a temporary and conditional restraint, where vital
public interests would otherwise suffer, was removed by
our decisions relating to the enforcement of provisions of
leases during a period of scarcity of housing. Block v.
Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170; Edgar A. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel,
258 U.S. 242. The case of Block v. Hirsh, supra, arose in
the District of Columbia and involved the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment. The cases of the Marcus
Brown Company and the Levy Leasing Company arose
under legislation of New York and the constitutional provision against the impairment of the obligation of contracts was invoked. The statutes of New York,1 declarhig that a public emergency existed, directly interfered
with the enforcement of covenants for the surrender of the
possession of premises on the expiration of leases. Within
the City of New York and contiguous counties, the owners
of dwellings, including apartment and tenement houses
(but excepting buildings under construction in September,
1920, lodging houses for transients and the larger hotels),
were wholly deprived until November 1, 1922, of all possessory remedies for the purpose of removing from their
premises the tenants or occupants in possession whenithe
laws took effect (save in certain specified instances), providing the tenants or occupants were ready, able and
willing to pay a reasonable rent or price for their use and

occupation. People v. La Fetra, 230 N.Y. 429, 438; 130
N.E. 601; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, id., 634; 130 N.E.
923. In the case of the Marcus Brown Company the
facts were thus stated by the District Court (269 Fed.
306, 312): "the tenant defendants herein, by law older
than the state of New York, became at the landlord's option trespassers on OctoberAI, 1920. Plaintiff had then
found and made a contract with a tenant it liked better,
and had done so before these statutes were enacted. By
them plaintiff is, after defendants elected to remain in
possession, forbidden to carry out his bargain with the
tenant he chose, the obligation of the covenant for peaceable surrender by defendants is impaired, and for the next
two years Feldman et al. may, if they like, remain in
plaintiff's apartment, provided they make good month by
month the allegation of their answer, i.e., pay what 'a
court of competent jurisdiction' regards as fair and reasonable compensation for such enforced use and occupancy." Answering the contention that the legislation as
thus applied contravened the constitutional prohibition,
this Court, after referring to its opinion in Block v. Hirsh,
supra, said: "In the present case more emphasis is laid
upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract of
the lessees to surrender possession and of the new lease
which was to have gone into effect upon October 1, last
year. But contracts are made subject to this exercise of
the power of the State when otherwise justified, as we
have held this to be." 256 U.S. p. 198. This decision
was followed in the case of the Levy Leasing Company,
8upra.
In these cases of leases, it will be observed that the
relief afforded was temporary and conditional; that it
was sustained because of the emergency due to scarcity
of housing; and that provision was made for reasonable
compensation to the landlord during the period he was

prevented from regaining possession. The Court also
decided that while the declaration by the legislature as
to the existence of the emergency was entitled to great
respect, it was not conclusive; and, further, that a law "depending upon the existence of an emergency or other
certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate
if the emergency ceases or the facts change even though
valid when passed." It is always open to judicial inquiry whether the exigency still exists upon which the
continued operation of the law depends. Chastleton
Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543, 547, 548.
It is manifest from this review of our decisions that
there has been a growing appreciation of public needs
and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare.
The settlement and consequent contraction of the public
domain, the pressure of a constantly increasing density
of population, the interrelation of the activities of our
people and the complexity of our economic interests, have
inevitably led to an increased use of the organization of
society in order to protect the very bases of individual
opportunity. Where, in earlier days, it was thought that
only the concerns of individuals or of classes were involved, and that those of the State itself were touched
only remotely, it has later been found that the fundamental interests of the State are directly affected; and
that the question is no longer merely that of one party
to a contract as against another, but of the use of reasonable means to safeguard the economic structure upon
which the good of all depends.
It is no answer to say that this public need was not
apprehended a century ago, or to insist that what the
provision of the Constitution meant to the vision of that
day it must mean to the vision of our time. If by the
statement that what the Constitution meant at the time

Opinion of the Court.

of its adoption it means to-day, it is intended to say that
the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to
the interpretation which the framers, with the conditions and outlook of their time, would have placed upon
them, the statement carries its own refutation. It was
to guard against such a narrow conception that Chief
Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning-" We
must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding" (McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,
407)-" a constitution intended to endure for ages to
come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various
crises of human affairs." Id., p. 415. When we are dealing with the words of the Constitution, said this Court in
Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 433, "we must realize
that they have called into life a being the development
of which could not have been foreseen completely by the
most gifted of its begetters. . . . The case before us must
be considered in the light of our whole experience and
not merely in that of what was said a hundred years
ago."
Nor is it helpful to attempt to draw a fine distinction
between the intended meaning of the words of the Constitution and their intended application. When we consider the contract clause and the decisions which have
expounded it in harmony with the essential reserved
power of the States to protect the security of their peoples, we find no warrant for the conclusion that the clause
has been warped by these decisions fro m its proper significance or that the founders of our Government would
have interpreted the clause differently had they had occasion to assume that responsibility in the conditions of
the later day. The vast body of law which has been developed was unknown to the fathers, but it is believed to
have preserved the essential content and the spirit of the
Constitution. With a growing recognition of public needs

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

and the relation of individual right to public security, the
court has sought to prevent the perversion of the clause
through its use as an instrument to throttle the capacity
of the States to protect their fundamental interests. This
development is a growth from the seeds which the fathers
planted. It is a development forecast by the prophetic
words of Justice Johnson in Ogden v. Saunders, already
quoted. And the germs of the later decisions are found
in the early cases of the Charles River Bridge and the
West River Bridge, supra, which upheld the public right
against strong insistence upon the contract clause. The
principle of this development is, as we have seen, that
the reservation of the reasonable exercise of the protective power of the State is read into all contracts and
there is no greater reason for refusing to apply this principle to Minnesota mortgages than to New York leases.
Applying the criteria established by our decisions we
conclude:
1. An emergency existed in Minnesota which furnished
a proper occasion for the exercise of the reserved power
of the State to protect the vital interests of the community. The declarations of the existence of this emergency by the legislature and by the Supreme Court of
Minnesota cannot be regarded as a subterfuge or as lacking in adequate basis. Block v. Hirsh, supra. The finding of the legislature and state court has support in the
facts of which we take judicial notice. Atchison, T. &
S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 248, 260. It is
futile to attempt to make a comparative estimate of the
seriousness of the emergency shown in the leasing cases
from New York and of the emergency disclosed here. The
particular facts differ, but that there were in Minnesoti
conditions urgently demanding relief, if power existed to
give it, is beyond cavil. As the Supreme Court of Minnesota said, the economic emergency which threatened "the

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

445

Opinion of the Court.

loss of homes and lands which furnish those in possession
the necessary shelter and means of subsistence" was a
"potent cause" for the enactment of the statute.
2. The legislation was addressed to a legitimate end,
that is, the legislation was not for the mere advantage
of particular individuals but for the protection of a basic
interest of society.
3. In view of the nature of the contracts in questionmortgages of unquestionable validity-the relief afforded
and justified by the emergency, in order not to contravene the constitutional provision, could only be of a character appropriate to that emergency and could be granted
only upon reasonable conditions.
4. The conditions upon which the period of redemption
is extended do not appear to be unreasonable. The initial extension of the time of redemption for thirty days
from the approval of the Act was obviously to give a
reasonable opportunity for the authorized application to
the court. As already noted, the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness is not impaired; interest continues to
run; the validity of the sale and the right of a mortgageepurchaser to title or to obtain a deficiency judgment, if
the mortgagor fails to redeem within the extended period,
are maintained; and the conditions of redemption, if redemption there be, stand as they were under the prior
law. The mortgagor during the extended period is not
ousted from possession but he must pay the rental value
of the premises as ascertained in judicial proceedings and
this amount is applied to the carrying of the property
and to interest upon the indebtedness. The mortgageepurchaser during the time that he cannot obtain possession thus is not left without compensation for the withholding of possession. Also important is the fact that
mortgagees, as is shown by official reports of which we
may take notice, are predominantly corporations, such as

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

insurance companies, banks, and investment and mortgage companies." These, and such individual mortgagees
as are small investors, are not seeking homes or the opportunity to engage in farming. Their chief concern is the
reasonable protection of their investment security. It
does not matter that there are, or may be, individual cases
of another aspect. The legislature was entitled to deal
with the general or typical situation. The relief afforded
by the statute has regard to the interest of mortgagees
as well as to the interest of mortgagors. The legislation
seeks to prevent the impending ruin of both by a considerate measure of relief.
In the absence of legislation, courts of equity have exercised jurisdiction in suits for the foreclosure of mortgages
to fix the time and terms of sale and to refuse to confirm
sales upon equitable grounds where they were found to
be unfair or inadequacy of price was so gross as to shock
the conscience. 1 The "equity of redemption " is the
creature of equity. While courts of equity could not alter
the legal effect of the forfeiture of the estate at common
law on breach of condition, they succeeded, operating on
the conscience of the mortgagee, in maintaining that it
was unreasonable that he should retain for his own benefit
what was intended as a mere security; that the breach of
condition was in the nature of a penalty, which ought to
be relieved against, and that the mortgagor had an equity
to redeem on payment of principal, interest and costs,

notwithstanding the forfeiture at law. This principle of
equity was victorious against the strong opposition of the
common law judges, who thought that by "the Growth
of Equity on Equity the Heart of the Common Law is
eaten out." The equitable principle became firmly established and its application could not be frustrated even by
the engagement of the debtor entered into at the time of
the mortgage, the courts applying the equitable maxim
"once a mortgage, always a mortgage, and nothing but a
mortgage." 18 Although the courts would have no authority to alter a statutory period of redemption, the
legislation in question permits the courts to extend that
period, within limits and upon equitable terms, thus providing a procedure and relief which are cognate to the
historic exercise of the equitable jurisdiction. If it be
determined, as it must be, that the contract clause is not
an absolute and utterly unqualified restriction of the
State's protective power, this legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the legislative competency.
5. The legislation is temporary in operation. It is limited to the exigency which called it forth. While the
postponement of the period of redemption from the foreclosure.sale is to May 1, 1935, that period may be reduced
by the order of the court under the statute, in case of a
change in circumstances, and the operation of the statute
itself could not validly outlast the emergency or be so extended as virtually to destroy the contracts.
We are of the opinion that the Minnesota statute as
here applied does not violate the contract clause of the
Federal Constitution. Whether the legislation is wise or

Few questions of greater, moment than that just decided have been submitted for judicial inquiry during this
generation. He simply closes his eyes to the necessary
implications of the decision who fails to see in it the potentiality of future gradual but ever-advancing encroachments upon the sanctity of private and public contracts.
The effect of the Minnesota, legislation, though serious
enough in itself, is of trivial significance compared with
the far more serious and dangerous inroads upon the limitations of the Constitution which are almost certain to
ensue as a consequence naturally following any step beyond the boundaries fixed by that instrument. And those
of us who are thus apprehensive of the effect of this decision would, in a matter so important, be neglectful of
our duty should we fail to spread upon the permanent
records of the court the reasons which move ps to the
opposite view.
A orovision of the Constitution, it is hardly necessary
to say, does not admit of two distinctly opposite inter-

pretations. It does not mean one thing at one time and
an entirely different thing at another time. If the contract impairment clause, when framed and adopted, meant
that the terms of a contract for the payment of money
could not be altered in invitum by a state statute enacted
for the relief of hardly pressed debtors to the end and
with the effect of postponing payment or enforcement
during and because of an economic or financial emergency, it is but to state the obvious to say that it means
the same now. This view, at once so rational in its application to the written word, and so necessary to the
stability of constitutional principles, though from time to
time challenged, has never, unless recently, been put within the realm of doubt by the decisions of this court. The
true rule was forcefully declared in Ex parte Milligan, 4
Wall. 2, 120-121, in the face of circumstances of national
peril and public unrest and disturbance far greater than
any that exist today. In that great case this court said
that the provisions of the Constitution there under consideration had been expressed by our ancestors in such
plain English words that it would seem the ingenuity of
man could not evade them, but that after the lapse of
more than seventy years they were sought to be avoided.
"Those great and good men," the court said, "foresaw
that troublous times would arise, when rulers and people
would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp
and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just
and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable
law. The history of the world had taught them that what
was done in the past might be attempted in the future."
And then, in words the power and truth of which have
become increasingly evident with the lapse of time, there
was laid down the rule without which the Constitution
would cease to be the "supreme law of the land," binding equally upon governments and governed at all times

and under all circumstances, and become a mere collection of political maxims to be adhered to or disregarded
according to the prevailing sentiment or the legislative
and judicial opinion in respect of the supposed necessities
of the hour:
"The Constitution of the United States is a law for
rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers
with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all
times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by
the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be
suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or
despotism, . . ?'

Chief Justice Taney, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19
How. 393, 426, said that while the Constitution remains
unaltered it must be construed now as it was understood
at the time of its adoption; that it is not only the same
in words but the same in meaning, " and as long as it
continues to exist in its present form, it speaks not only
in the same words, but with the same meaning and intent with which it spoke when it came from the hands of
its framers, and was voted on and adopted by the people
of the United States. Any other rule of construction
would abrogate the judicial character of this court, and
make it the mere reflex of the popular opinion or passion
of the day." And in South Carolina v. United States,
199 U.S. 437, 44-449, in an opinion by Mr. Justice
Brewer, this court quoted these words with approval and
said:
"The Constitution is a written instrument. As such
its meaning does not alter. That which it meant when
adopted it means now. . . . Those things which are
within its grants of power, as those grants were understood when made, are still within them, and those things
not within them remain still excluded."

SUTHERLAND, J., dissenting.

The words of Judge Campbell, speaking for the Supreme Court of Michigan in Twitchell v. Blodgett, 13
Mich. 127, 139-140, are peculiarly apposite. "But it
may easily happen," he said, "that specific provisions
may, in unforeseen emergencies, turn out to have been inexpedient. This does not make these provisions any less
binding. Constitutions can nQt be changed by events
alone. They remain binding as the acts of the people
in their sovereign capacity, as the framers of Government, until they are amended or abrogated by the action
prescribed by the authority which created them. It is
not competent for any department of the Government to
change a constitution, or declare it changed, simply because it appears ill adapted to a new state of things.
Restrictions have, it is true, been found more
likely than grants to be unsuited to unforeseen circumstances . . . But, where evils arise from the application
of such regulations, their force cannot be denied or
evaded; and the remedy consists in repeal or amendment, and not in false constructions."
The provisions of the Federal Constitution, undoubtedly, are pliable in the- sense that in appropriate cases
they have the capacity of bringing within their grasp
every new condition which falls within their meaning.,
But, their meaning is changeless; it is only their application which is extensible. See South Carolinav. United
States, supra, pp. 448-449. Constitutional grants of
'Insuch cases it is no more necessary to modify constitutional rules
to govern new conditions than it is to create new words to describe
them. The commerce clause is a good example. When that was
adopted its application was necessarily confined to the regulation of
the primitive methods of transportation then employed; but railroads,

automobiles and aircraft automatically were brought within the scope
and subject to the terms of the commerce clause the moment these
new means of transportation came into existence, just as they were at
once brought within the meaning of the word " carrier," as defined
by the dictionaries.

power and restrictions upon the exercise of power are not
flexible as the doctrines of the common law are flexible.
These doctrines, upon the principles of the common law
itself, modify or abrogate themselves wheneverkthey are
or whenever they become plainly unsuited to different or
changed conditions. Funk v. United States, ante, p. 371.
The distinction is clearly pointed out by Judge Cooley,
1 Constitutional Limitations, 8th ed., 124:
"A principal share of the benefit expected from written
constitutions would be lost if the rules they established
were so flexible as to bend to circumstances or be modified
by public opinion. It is with special reference to the
varying moods of public opinion, and with a view to putting the fundamentals of government beyond their control, that these instruments are framed; and there can
be no such steady and imperceptible change in their rules
as inheres in the principles of the common law. Those
beneficent maxims of the common law which guard person
and property have grown and expanded until they mean
vastly more to us than they did to our ancestors, and are
more minute, particular, and pervading' in their protections; and we may confidently look forward in the future
to still further modifications in the direction of improvement. Public sentiment and action effect such changes,
and the courts recognize them; but a court or legislature
which should allow a change in public sentiment to influence it in giving to a written constitution a construction not warranted by the intention of its founders, would
be justly chargeable with reckless disregard of official
oath and public duty; and if its course could become a
precedent, these instruments would be of little avail.
. . . What a court is to do, therefore, is to declare the law

as written, leaving it to the people themselves to make
such changes as new circumstances may require. The
meaning of the constitution is fixed 'when it is adopted,

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

SUTHERLAND,

and it is not different at any subsequent time when a
court has occasion to pass upon it."
The whole aim of construction, as applied to a provision
of the Constitution, is to discover the meaning, to ascertain and give effect to the intent, of its framers and the
people who adopted it. Lake County v. Rollins, 130 U.S.
662, 770. The necessities which gave rise to the provision, the controversies which, preceded, as well as the
conflicts of opinion which were settled by its adoption,
are matters to be considered to enable us to arrive at a
correct result. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41, 95. The
history of the times, the state of things existing when the
provision was framed and adopted, should be looked to in
order to ascertain the~mischief and the remedy. Rhodb
Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657,.723; Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 410, 431-432. As nearly as possible we
should place ourselves in the condition of those who
framed and adopted it. Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 12.
And if the meaning be at all doubtful, the doubt should be
resolved, wherever reasonably possible to do so, in a way
to forward the evident purpose with which the provision
was adopted. Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581, 602; Jarrolt v. Moberly, 103 U.S. 580, 586.
An application of these principles to the question under
review removes any doubt, if otherwise there would be
any, that the contract impairment clause denies to the
several states the power to mitigate hard consequences resulting to debtors from financial or economic exigencies
by an impairment of the obligation of contracts of indebtedness. A, candid consideration of the history and circumstances which led up to and accompanied the framing
and adoption of this clause will demonstrate conclusively
that it was framed and adopted with the specific and
studied -purpose of preventing legislation designed to relieve debtors especially in time of financial distress. In-

deed, it is not probable that any other purpose was
definitely in the minds of those who composed the framers'
convention or the ratifying state conventions which followed, although the restriction has been given a wider
application upon principles clearly stated by Chief Justice
Marshall in the Dartmouth College Case, 4 Wheat. 518,
644-645.
Following the Revolution, and prior to the adoption of
the Constitution, the American people found themselves
in a greatly impoverished condition. Their commerce
had been well-nigh annihilated. They were not only
without luxuries, but in great degree were destitute of
the ordinary comforts and necessities of life. In these
circumstances they incurred indebtedness in the purchase of imported goods and otherwise, far beyond their
capacity to' pay. From this situation there arose a
divided sentiment. On the one hand, an exact observance of public and private engagements was insistently
urged. A violation of the faith of the nation or the
pledges of the private individual, it was insisted, was
equally forbidden by the principles of moral justice and
of sound policy. Individual distress, it was urged, should
be alleviated only by industry and frugality, not by relaxation of law or by a sacrifice of the rights of others.
Indiscretion or imprudence was not to be relieved by legislation, but restrained by the conviction that a full compliance with contracts would be exacted. On the other hand,
it was insisted that the case of the debtor should be
viewed with tenderness; and efforts were constantly directed toward relieving him from an exact compliance
with his contract. As a result of the latter view, state
laws were passed suspending the collection of debts, remitting or suspending the collection of taxes, providing
for the emission of paper money, delaying legal proceedings, etc. There followed, as there must always follow
from such a course, a long trail of ills, one of the direct

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.

consequences being a loss of confidence in the government and in the good faith of the people. Bonds of men
whose ability to pay their debts was unquestionable
could not be negotiated except at a discount of thirty,
forty, or fifty per cent. Real property could be sold only
at a ruinous loss. Debtors, instead of seeking to meet
their obligations by painful effort, by industry and economy, began to rest their hopes entirely upon legislative
interference. The impossibility of payment of public or
private debts was widely asserted, and in some instances
threats were made of suspending the administration of
justice by violence. The circulation of depreciated currency became common. Resentment against lawyers
and courts was freely "manifested, and in many instances
the course of the law was arrested and judges restrained
from proceeding in the execution of their duty by popular and tumultous assemblages. This state of things
alarmed all thoughtful men, and led them to seek some
effective remedy. Marshall, Life of Washington (1807),
Vol. 5, pp. 88-131.
That this brief outline of the situation is entirely accurate is borne out by all contemporaneous history, as well
as by writers of distinction of a later period.2 Compare
'Thus McMaster (History of the People of the United States, Vol.
1, p. 425)-after referring to the conditions in Rhode Island, where
"the bonds of society were dissolved by paper money and tender
laws "; in New Jersey, where the people nailed up the doors of their
court houses; in Virginia, where the debtors "set fire to theirs in
order to stop the course of justice "---says:
"The newspapers were full of bankrupt notices. The farmers'
taxes amounted to near the rent of their farms. Mechanics wandered up and down the streets of every city destitute of work. Ships,
shut out from every port of Europe, lay rotting in the harbors."
Channing (History of the United States, Vol. III, pp. 410-411,
482-483) paints this graphic picture of the situation:
"Nowhere was the immediate prospect more gloomy than in South
Carolina ....

were insufficient to pay even what was then owing. The case of

p. 536) says:
" The town of Greenwich computed that during each of the five
years preceding 1786 the farmers had paid in taxes the entire rental
value of their land."
John Fiske (The Critical Period of American History, 8th ed.,
pp. 175, 180) thus describes conditions:
"... about the market-places men spent their time angrily discussing politics, and scarcely a day passed without street-fights,
which at times grew into riots. In the country, too, no less than
in the cities, the goddess of discord reigned. The farmers determined to starve the city people into submission, and they entered
into an agreement not to send any produce into the cities until the
merchants should open their shops and begin selling their goods for
paper [money] at its face value. . . .the farmers threw away their
milk, used their corn for fuel, and let their apples rot on the
ground. ...
"... the courts were broken up by armed mobs. At Concord
one Job Shattuck brought several hundred armed men into the town
and surrounded the court-house, while in a fierce harangue he declared
that the time had come for wiping out all debts."
Dr. David Ramsay (History of the United States, 2d ed., 1818,

speaks, says:

generally in any effort to discharge their obligations.

and always furnished an apology, for not discharging private contracts. Confidence between man and-man received a deadly wound.
Public faith being first violated, private engagements lost much of
their obligatory force ...
"From the combined operation of these causes trade languished;,
credit expired; gold and silver vanished; and real property was
depreciated to an extent equal to that of the depreciation of
continental money, . . ."
And, finally, George Ticknor Curtis, in his History of the Origin,
Formation, and Adoption of the ConstitUtion of the United States,
Vol. 1, pp. 332-333:
"All contemporary evidence assures us that this [1783 to 1787] was
a period of great pecuniary distress, arising from the depreciation of
the vast quantities of paper money issued by the Federal and State
governments; from rash speculations; from the uncertain and fluctuating condition of trade; and from the great amount of foreign goods
forced into the country as soon as its ports were opened. Naturally,
in such a state of things, the debtors were disposed to lean in favor of
those systems of government and legislation which would tend to relieve or postpone the payment of their debts; and as such relief could
come only from their State governments, they were naturally the
friends of State rights and State authority, and were consequently not
friendly to any enlargement of the powers of the Federal Constitution. The same causes which led individuals to look to legislation for
irregular relief from the burden of their private contracts, led them
also to regard public obligations with similar impatience. Opposed
to this numerous class of persons were all those who felt the high
necessity of preserving inviolate every public and private obligation;
who saw that the separate power of the States could not accomplish
what was absolutely necessary to sustain both public and private
credit; and they were as naturally disposed to look to the resources
of the Union for these benefits, as the other class were to. look in an
opposite direction. These tendencies produced, in rearly every State,
a struggle, not as between two organized parties, but one that was all
along a contest for supremacy between opposite opinions, in which it
was at one time doubtful to which side the scale would turn."

In an attempt to meet the situation recourse was had
to the legislatures of the several states under the Confederation; and these bodies passed, among other acts, the
following: laws providing for the emission of bills of
credit and making them legal tender for the payment of
debts, and providing also for such payment by the delivery of specific property at a fixed valuation; instalment
laws, authorizing payment of overdue obligations at future intervals of time; stay laws and laws temporarily
closing access to the courts; and laws discriminating
against British creditors. I have selected, out of a vast

In the midst of this confused, gloomy, and seriously
exigent condition of affairs, the Constitutional Convention of 1787 met at Philadelphia. The defects of the
Articles of Confederation were so great as to be beyond
all hope of amendment, and the Convention, acting in
technical excess of its authority, proceeded to frame for
submission to the people of the several states an entirely
new Constitution. Shortly prior to the meeting of the
Convention, Madison had assailed a bill pending in the
Virginia Assembly, proposing the payment of private
debts in three annual instalments, on the ground that "no
legislative principle could vindicate such an interposition
"Creditors, naturally enough, resisted all of these schemes in the
state legislatures, and . . . turned to the idea of a national government so constructed as to prevent laws impairing the obligation of
contract, emitting paper money, and otherwise benefiting debtors. It
is idle to inquire whether the rapacity of the creditors or the total
depravity of the debtors . . .was responsible for this deep and bitter

antagonism. It is sufficient for our purposes to discover its existence
and to find its institutional reflex in the Constitution."
Fisher Ames, "Eulogy on Washington," The Life and Works of
Fisher Ames, Vol. II, p. 76:
"Accordingly, in some of the States, creditors were treated as outlaws; bankrupts were armed with legal authority to be persecutors;
and by the shock, of all confidence and faith, society was shaken to
its foundations."
Illuminating comment upon some of this state legislation is to be
found in Chapter VI (Vol. I) of Bancroft's "History of the Formation of the Constitution of the United States," under the heading,
"State Laws Impairing the Obligation of Contracts Prove the Need
of an Overruling Union," pp. 230-236:

der it the duty of a government in some measure to
interfere by passing laws totally or partially stopping
courts of justice, or authorizing the debtor to pay by
instalments; that such regulations had been found necessary in most or all of the states "to prevent the wealthy
creditor and the moneyed man from totally destroying
the poor, though industrious debtor. Such times may
again arrive." And he was apprehensive of any proposal
which took from the respective states the power to give
their debtor citizens "a moment's indulgence, however
necessary it might be, and however desirous to grant them

Mr. Davie declared that the prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts and other restrictions ought
to supersede the laws of particular states. He thought
the constitutional provisions were founded on the strongest principles of justice.1" Pinckney, in the South Carolina debates, said that he considered the section including
the clause in question as "the soul of the Constitution,"

The provision was strongly defended in The Federalist,
both by Hamhilton in No. 7 and Madison in No. 44.
Madison concluded his defense of the clause by saying:
tion and of the conflicting views which were before the state conventions for consideration. He says in part:
"The Convention then was asked to perfect their action in favor
of honesty and morality, by adding a prohibition on the States which
would put an end to statutes enacting laws for special individuals,
setting aside Court judgments, repealing vested rights, altering corporate charters, staying the bringing or prosecution of suits, preventing foreclosure of mortgages, altering the terms of contracts, and
-allowing tender in payment of debts of something other than that
contracted for. The State Legislatures had hitherto passed such
laws in abundant measure, and the situation was graphically described
later by Chief Justice Marshall in one of his most noted decisions
[Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 354], as follows:
"'The power of changing the relative situation of debtor and
creditor, of interfering with contracts, a power which comes home to
every man, touches the interest of all, and controls the conduct of
every individual in. those things which he supposes to be proper for
his own exclusive management, had been used to such an excess by
the State Legislatures as to break in upon the ordinary intercourse of
society and destroy all confidence between man and man. The mischief had become so great, so alarming, as not only to impair commercial intercourse and threaten the existence of credit, but to sap the
morals of the people and destroy the sanctity of private faith. To
guard against the continuance of the evil was an object of deep interest with all the-truly wise as well as virtuous of this great community,
and was one of the important benefits expected from a reform of the
government.'
" To obviate the conditions thus described, King of Massachusetts
proposed the insertion of a new restriction on the States ....
Wilson
and Madison supported his motion. Mason and G. Morris, however,
believed that it went too far in interfering with the powers of the
States. . . . There was also a genuine belief by some delegates that,
under some circumstances and in financial crises, such stay and tender
laws might be necessary to avert calamitous loss to debtors. ...
The other delegates had been deeply impressed by the disastrous
social and economic effects of the. stay and tender laws which had
been enacted by most of the States between 1780 and 1786, and they
decided to make similar legislation impossible in the future."

... one legislative interference is but the first link of
a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference
being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding.
They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough
reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and
give a regular course to the business of society."
Contemporaneous history is replete with evidence of
the sharp conflict of opinion with respect to the advisability of adopting the clause. Dr. Ramsay (The History
of South-Carolina (1809), Vol. II, pp. 431-433), already
referred to, writing of the action of South Carolina and
especially referring to the contract impairment clause,
says that this Constitution was accepted and ratified on
behalf of the state, and speaks of it as an act of great selfdenial:
"The power thus given up by South-Carolina, was one
she thought essential to her welfare, and had freely exercised for several preceding years. Such a relinquishment
she would not have made at any period of the last five
years; for in them she had passed no less than six acts
interfering between debtor and creditor, with the view of
obtaining a respite for the former under particular circumstances of public distress. To tie up the hands of future
legislatures so as to deprive them of a power of repeating
similar acts on any emergency, was a display both of wisdom and magnanimity. It would seem as if experience
-had convinced the state of its political errors, and induced
a willingness to retrace its steps and relinquish a power
which had been improperly used."
There is an old case, Glaze v. Drayton, 1 Desaus. Eq.
(S.C.) 109, decided in 1784, where the South Carolina
court of chancery entered a decree for the specific performance of a contract for the purchase of land, but providing for the payment of the balance due under the con-

tract "by instalments, at the times mentioned in the acts
of assembly respecting the recovery of old debts." In reporting that case soon after the adoption of the Constitution, Chancellor Desaussure added the following explanatory and illuminating note [p. 110]:
"The legislature, in consideration of the distressed state
of the country, after the war, had passed an act, preventing the immediate recovery of debts, and fixing certain
periods for the payment of debts, far beyond the periods
fixed by the contract of the parties. These interferences
with private contracts, became very common with most
of the state legislatures, even after the distresses arising
from the war had ceased in a great degree. They produced distrust and irritation throughout the community, to
such an extent, that new troubles were apprehended; and
nothing contributed more to prepare the public mind for
giving up a portion of the state sovereignty, and adopting
an efficient national government, than these abuses of
power by the state legislatures."
If it be possible by resort to the testimony of history
to put any question of constitutional intent beyond the
domain of uncertainty, the foregoing leaves no reasonable
ground upon which to base a denial that the clause of the
Constitution now under consideration was meant to foreclose state action impairing the obligation of contracts
primarilyand especially in respect of such action aimed at
giving relief to debtors in time of emergency. And if
further proof be required to strengthen what already is
inexpugnable, such proof will be found in the previous
decisions of this court. There are many such decisions;
but it is necessary to refer to a few only which bear directly upon the question, namely: Bronson v. Kinzie, 1
How. 311; McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608; Gantly's
Lessee v. Ewing, 3 How. 707; Howard v. Bugbee, 24 How.

Beverly, 163 U.S. 118; and Bradley v. Lightcap, 195 U.S. 1.
Bronson v. Kinzie was decided at the January Term,
1843. The case involved an Illinois statute, extending
the period of redemption for a period of twelve months
after a sale under a decree in chancery, and another
statute preventing a sale unless two-thirds of the amount
at which the property had been valued by appraisers
should be bid therefor. This court held both statutes invalid, when applied to an existing mortgage, as infringing the contract impairment clause. No more need now
be said as to the points decided. The opinion of the court
says nothing about an emergency; but it is clear that the
statute was passed for the purpose of meeting the panic
and depression which began in 1837 and continued for
some years thereafter.1 And in the light of what is now
to be said, it is evident that the question of that emergency as a basis for the legislation was so definitely involved that it must have been considered by the court.
The emergc;ww was quite as serious as that which the
country has faced during the past three years. Indeed,
it was so great that in one instance, at least, a state
repudiated a portion of its public debt, and others were
strongly tempted to do so." Mr. Warren, in his book,
"The Supreme Court in United States History," Vol.
2, pp. 376-379, gives a vivid picture of the situation.
After referring to Bronson v. Kinzie and the statute extending the period of redemption therein dealt with, he
points to the prevailing state of business and finance

which had called the statute into existence; to the bank
failures, state debt repudiations, scarcity of hard money,
the inability to pay debts except by disposing of property at ruinous prices; to the enactment of statutes for
the relief of debtors, stay laws postponing collection of
debts, etc., which had been passed by state after state;
and to the action of this court in striking down the state
statute in the face of these conditions.
"Unquestionably," he continues, "the country owes
much of its prosperity to the unflinching courage with
which, in the face of attack, the Court has maintained its
firm stand in behalf of high standards of business morale,
requiring honest payment of debts and strict performance
of contracts; and its rigid construction of the Constitution to this end has been one of the glories of the Judiciary. That its decisions should, at times, have met with
disfavor among the debtor class was, however, entirely
natural; and while, ultimately, these debtor-relief-laws
have always proved to be injurious to the very class they
were designed to relieve and to increase the financial distress, fraud and extortion, temporarily, debtors have always believed such laws to be their salvation and have
resented judicial decisions holding them invalid. Consequently, this opinion of the Court in the Bronson Case
aroused great antagonism in the Western States. In Illinois, a mass meeting was held which resolved that the
decision ought not to be heeded, . . . Later, deference
to the antagonism aroused against the Court by this decision was made when the Senator from Illinois, James
Semple, introduced in the Senate in 1846, a joint resolution propoling a Constitutional Amendment to prohibit
the Supreme Court from declaring void 'any Act of Congress or any State regulation on the ground that it is contrary to the Constitution of the United States . . .' "
McMaster (supra, note 2), Vol. VII, pp. 44-48, is to
the same effect.

McCracken v. Hayward, decided at the January Term,
1844, dealt with the same Illinois statute; but involved a
sale on execution after judgment, whereas Bronson v.
Kinzie involved a mortgage. The decision simply followed the Bronson case. What has been said in respect
of the background and setting of that case is equally
applicable and need not be repeated.
Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing was decided at the January
Term, 1845. It held unconstitutional, as applied to a
preexisting mortgage an act of Indiana providing that
no real property should be sold on execution for less than
half its appraised value. The statute, like those of Illinois, was enacted for the benefit of hard-pressed debtors
as a result of the same emergency. It is referred to by
McMaster, supra, as one of the "marks on the statute
books" which the "evil times through which the people
were passing" had left.
Howard v. Bugbee, decided at the December Term,
1860, dealt with an Alabama statute authorizing a redemption of mortgaged property in two years after the
sale under a decree. The statute was declared unconstitutional principally upon the authority of Bronson v.
Kinzie. The opinion is very short and does not refer to
the question of emergency. The statute was passed, however, in 1842 (the mortgage having been executed prior
thereto), and was, therefore, one of the emergency statutes of that period. The Alabama Supreme Court, whose
decision was under review here, so treated it, and justified
the statute upon that ground. 32 Ala. 713, 716-717. It
is worthy of note that after the decision of this court in
the Bugbee case, Judge Walker, who delivered the opinion
therein for the Alabama court, filed a dissenting opinion in
Ex parte Pollard,Ex parte Woods, 40 Ala. 77, 110, in the
course of which he said that his former opinion had been
overruled by this court and he could no longer perceive

any ground upon which the convictions of a legislature as
to the welfare of the people could enlarge the authority
to interfere, through the manipulation of the remedy,
with the obligation of contracts. The basis of the legislation was, and is shown by the decision of the Alabama
Supreme Court sustaining it to be, the existence of the
great emergency beginning in 1837; and that question,
since the Alabama decision was reviewed, was quite
plainly before this court for consideration.
Walker v. Whitehead, decided at the December Term,
1872, held unconstitutional a Georgia statute requiring
the plaintiff, suing on a debt or contract, to prove as a
condition precedent to the entry of judgment in his favor
that all legal taxes chargeable by law thereon had been
duly paid for each year since the making of the debt or
contract. The Georgia Supreme Court, 43 Ga. 538, 544546, had sustained the act as a measure made necesaary
by the desperate financial and economic conditions in
that state due to the Civil War. This court, making no
response to the somewhat fervid presentation of this view
of the matter by the state court, simply said that the
degree of impairment was immaterial; that any impairment of the obligation of a contract is within the prohibition of the Constitution; that "A clearer case of a law
impairing the obligation of a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution, can hardly occur."
Edwardsv. Kearzey, decided at the October Term, 1877,
held invalid, as applied to a preexisting debt, the provision of the North Carolina constitution of 1868 increasing
the exemptions to which a debtor was entitled. The
North Carolina Supreme Court, in a series of decisions,
had sustained the state constitutional provision, principally upon the ground (Garrett v. Chesire, 69 N.C. 396,
404-405) that it was adopted at a time when "probably
one-half of the debtor class are owing more old debts than

470

they can pay "; and that "If under our circumstances our
people are to be left without any exemptions, the policy
of chriatian civilization is lost sight of, . . ." In the brief
of defendant in error in this court (pp. 7-8) the view
was strongly urged that the provision was not so much for
the benefit of the debtor as for that of the state, to prevent the evils of almost universal pauperism. Attention
was called to the desperate condition of the people of the
state following the Civil War, and it was said that onethird of the whole population were paupers, all their property except lands having disappeared; that one-half of the
people did not own land enough to afford burial for that
proportion of the population; and against those who did
own land the ante-war debts were piled mountain high.
It was submitted that the state, on being rehabilitated,
was not bound to allow the creditor to strip the few selfsupporting land owners of their means of existence and
thereby add them to the vast army of the impoverished;
but that it had the right to defer a portion of the creditor's
claim until the prostrated community had opportunity to
recoup some of its losses.
This court, in response, reviewed the history of the
adoption of the contract impairment clause and held the
state constitutional provision invalid. "' Policy and humanity,'" it said, " are dangerous guides in the discussion
of a legal proposition. He who follows them far is apt to
bring back the means of error and delusion. The prohibition contains no qualification, and we have no judicial
authority to interpolate any. Our duty is simply to execute it." [Italics added.]
Barnitz v, Beverly was decided May 18, 1896. A law of
Kansas extended the period of redemption from a sale
under a mortgage for a period of eighteen months, during
which time the mortgagor was to remain in possession and
receive rents and profits, except as necessary for repairs.

The act was passed in 1893 in the midst of another panic,
the severity of which, still within the memory of the
members of this court, is a matter of common knowledge.
The effects of that panic extended into every form of
industry; bank failures were on an unprecedented scale;
more than half the railroads of the country were in the
hands of receivers; securities fell to fifty per cent., often
to twenty-five per cent., of their former value; commercial failures and unemployment became general; heavy
inroads were made upon public and private resources in
caring for the hungry and destitute; " great bodies of idle
men-the so-called " industrial armies "-marched toward
Washington, feeding like locusts upon the country through
which they passed.
These conditions were brought to the attention of this
court. In addition, the Supreme Court of Kansas, 55
Kans. 466, 484-485; 42 Pac. 725, 731, had relied upon
them as a justification for the legislation, and had inquired why the state legislature in a time of general depression could not "extend the indefinite estate impliedly reserved by the mortgagor, as the federal courts of
equity do in particular cases, beyond the six months
allowed by the general practice?"
In response to all of which, this court, after reviewing
its former decisions, held the statute invalid as applied
to a sale under a mortgage executed before its passage.
The present exigency is nothing new. From the beginning of our existence as a nation, periods of depression, of industrial failure, of financial distress, of unpaid

gance, financed by promises to pay, either must end in
complete or partial repudiation or the promises be fulfilled by self-denial and painful effort, though constantly taught by bitter experience, seems never to be learned;
and the attempt by legislative devices to shift the misfortune of the debtor to the shoulders of the creditor
without coming into conflict with the contract impairment clause has been persistent and oft-repeated.
The defense of the Minnesota law is made upon
grounds which were discountenanced by the makers of
the Constitution and have many times been rejected by
this court. That defense should not now succeed, because
it constitutes an effort to overthrow the constitutional
provision by an appeal to facts and circumstances identical with those which brought it into existence. With due
regard for the processes of logical thinking, it legitimately cannot be urged that conditions which produced the
rule may now be invoked to destroy it.
The lower court, and counsel for the appellees in their
argument here, frankly admitted that the statute does
constitute a material impairment of the contract, but
conteAded that such legislation is brought within the
state power by the present emergency. If I understand
the opinion just delivered, this court is not wholly in
accord with that view. The opinion concedes that emergency does not create power, or increase granted power,
or remove or diminish restrictions upon power granted or
reserved. It then proceeds to say, however, that while
emergency does not create power, it may furnish the
occasion for the exercise of power. I can only interpret
what is said on that subject as meaning that while an
emergency does not diminish a restriction upon power it
furnishes an occasion for diminishing it; and this, as it
seems to me, is merely to say the same thing by the use
of another set of words, with the effect of affirming that
which has just been denied.

It is quite true that an emergency may supply the
occasion for the exercise of power, depending upon the
nature of the power and the intent of the Constitution
with respect thereto. The emergency of war furnishes
an occasion for the exercise of certain of the war powers. This the Constitution contemplates, since they cannot be exercised upon any other occasion. The existence
of another kind of emergency authorizes the United
States to protect each of the states of the Union against
domestic violence. Const. Art. IV, § 4. But we are here
dealing not with a power granted by the Federal Constitution, but with the state police power, which exists
in its own right. Hence the question is not whether an
emergency furnishes the occasion for the exercise of that
state power, but whether an emergency furnishes an
occasion for the relaxation of the restrictions upon the
power imposed by the contract impairment clause; and
the difficulty is that the contract impairment clause forbids state action under any circumstances, if it have the
effect of impairing the obligation of contracts. That
clause restricts every state power in the particular specified, no matter what may be the occasion. It does not
contemplate that an emergency shall furnish an occasion for softening the restriction or making it any the
less a restriction upon state action in that contingency
than it is under strictly normal conditions.
The Minnesota statute either impairs the obligation
of contracts or it does not. If it does not, the occasion
to which it relates becomes immaterial, since then the
passage of the statute is the exercise of a normal, unrestricted, state power and requires no special occasion to
render it effective. If it does, the emergency no more
furnishes a proper occasion for its exercise than if the
emergency were non-existent. And so, while, in form,
the suggested distinction seems to put us forward in a
straight line, in reality it simply carries us back in a

circle, like bewildered travelers lost in a wood, to the
point where we parted company with the view of the

state court.
If what has now been said is sound, as I think it is,
we come to what really is the vital question in the case:
Does the Minnesota statute constitute an impairment of
the obligation of the contract now under review?
In answering that question we must first of all distinguish the present legislation from those statutes which,
although interfering in some degree with the terms of
contracts, or having the effect of entirely destroying them,
have nevertheless been sustained as not impairing the
obligation of contracts in the constitutional sense.
Among these statutes are such as affect the remedy merely,
as to which this court said in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra,
at p. 316, and repeated in Edwards v. Kearzey, supra, p.
604, "Whatever belongs merely to the remedy may be
altered according to the will of the state, provided the
alteration does not impair the obligation of the contract.
But if that effect is produced, it is immaterial whether it
is done by acting on the remedy or directly on the contract
itself. In either case it is prohibited by the Constitution."
Another class of statutes is illustrated by those exempting from execution and sale certain classes of property,
like the tools of an artisan. Chief Justice Taney, in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, speaking obiter, said that a state
might properly exempt necessary implements of agriculture, or the tools of a mechanic, or articles of necessity in
household furniture. But this court, in Edwards v. Kearzey, supra,struck down a provision of the North Carolina
constitution which exempted every homestead, and the
dwelling and buildings used therewith, not exceeding in
value $1,000, on the ground of its unconstitutionality as
applied to a contract already in existence. Referring to
the opinion in Bronson v. Kinzie, the court said (p, 604)

HOME BLDG. & L. ASSN. v. BLAISDELL.
398

SUTHERLAND,

475

J., dissenting.

that the Chief Justice seems to have had in his mind the
-maxim "de minimis," etc. "Upon no other ground can
any exemption be justified."
It is quite true also that "the reservation of essential
attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts ";
and that the legislature cannot "bargain away the public
health or the public morals." General statutes to put
an end to lotteries, the sale or manufacture of intoxicating
liquors, the maintenance of nuisances, to protect the public safety, etc., although they have the indirect effect of
absolutely destroying private contracts previously made
in contemplation of a continuance of the state of affairs
then in existence but subsequently prohibited, have been
uniformly upheld as not violating the contract impairment clause. The distinction between legislation of that
character and the Minnesota statute, however, is readily
observable. It may be demonstrated by an example. A,
engaged in the business of manufacturing intoxicating
liquor within a state, makes a contract, we will suppose,
with B to manufacture and deliver at a stipulated price
and at some date in the future, a quantity of whisky.
Before the day arrives for the performance of the contract
the state passes a law prohibiting the manufacture and
sale of intoxicating liquor. The contract immediately
falls because its performance has ceased to be lawful.
This is so because the contract is made upon the implied
condition that a particular state of things shall continue
to exist, "and when that state of things ceases to exist
the bargain itself ceases to exist." Marshall v. Glanvill,
[1917] 2 K.B. 87, 91. In that case the plaintiff had been
employed by the defendants upon a contract of service.
While the contract was in force the country became involved in the World War, and plaintiff was called into the
military service. The court held that this rendered performance unlawful and that the contract was at an end.
It said:

476

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
SUTHRLAND,

290 U.S.

"Here the parties clearly made their bargain on the
footing that it should continue lawful for the plaintiff
to render and for the defendants to accept his services.
The rendering and acceptance of these services ceased to
be lawful in July, 1916, and thereupon the bargain came
to an end."
In In re Shipton, Anderson & Co., [1915] 3 K.B. 676, a
parcel of wheat then lying in a warehouse was sold for
future payment and delivery. The wheat was subsequently requisitioned by the English government, and the
sellers became unable to deliver. The Court of King's
Bench Division held that the sellers were not liable.
Darling, Justice, agreeing with the opinion of Lord Reading, said (pp. 683-684):
"If one contracts to do what is then illegal, the contract
itself is altogether bad. If after the contract has been
made it cannot be performed without what is illegal being
done, there is no obligation to perform it. In the one case
the making of the contract, in the other case the performance of it, is against public policy. It must be here
,presumed that the Crown acted legally, and there is no
contention to the contrary. We are in a state of war; that
is notorious. The subject-matter of this contract has
been seized by the State acting for the general good.
Salus populi suprema lex is a good maxim, and the enforcement of that essential law gives no right of action to
whomsoever may be injured by it."
The general subject is discussed by this court in Omnia
Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 502; and it is there pointed
out (p. 513) that the effect of such a requisition is not to
appropriate the contract but to frustrate it-an essentially different thing.
The same distinction properly may be made as to the
contract impairment clause, in respect of subsequent state
legislation rendering unlawful a state of things which was
lawful when an obligation relating thereto was contracted.

SUTHERLAND,

By such legislation the obligation is not impaired in the
constitutional sense. The contract is frustrated-it disappears in virtue of an implied condition to that effect
read into the contract itself. Thus, in F. A. Tamplin
Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.,
[1916] 2 A.C. 397, the House of Lords lwd before it a case
where a steamer, then subject to a charter party having
nearly three years to run, had been requisitioned by the
Admiralty. The applicable rule was there stated to be
that the court should examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made in order to see whether
or not from their nature the parties must have made their
bargain on the footing that a particular state of things
would continue to exist. And if they must have done so,
a term to that effect would be implied, though not expressed in the contract. In Metropolitan Water Board v.
Dick, Kerr & Co., [1918] A.C. 119, 127-128, 137, that
rule was reaffirmed, with the additional statement that a
subsequent law might be the cause of an impossibility of
performance, by taking away something from the control
of the party as to which thing he had contracted to do or
not to do something else; and that the court must determine whether this contingency is of such a character that
it can reasonably be implied to have been in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.
Bearing in mind these aids toward determining whether
such an implied condition may be read into a particular
contract, let us re' ert to the example already given with
respect to an agreement for the manufacture and sale of
intoxicating liquor. And let us suppose that the state,
instead of passing legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of the commodity, in which event the doctrine of implied conditions would be pertinent, continues
to recognize the general lawfulness of the business, but, because of what it conceives to be a justifying emergency,
provides that the time for the performance of existing

478

290 US.

contracts for future manufacture and sale shall be extended for a specified period of time. It is perfectly admissible, in view of the state power to prohibit the
business, to read into the contract an implied proviso to
the effect that the business of manufacturing and selling
intoxicating liquors shall not, prior to the date when performance is due, become unlawful; but in the case last
put, to read into the contract a pertinent provisional exception in the event of intermeddling state action would
be more than unreasonable, it would be absurd, since we
must assume that the contract was made on the footing
that so long as the obligation remained lawful the impairment clause would effectively preclude a law altering or
nullifying it however exigent the occasion might be.
That, in principle, is precisely the case here. The contract is to repay a loan within a fixed time, with the express condition that upon failure the property given as
security shall be sold, and that, in the absence of a timely
redemption, title shall be vested absolutely in the purchaser. This contract was lawful when made; and it has
never been anything else. What the legislature has done
is to pass a statute which does not have the effect of frustrating the contract by rendering its performance unlawful, but one which, at the election of one of the parties,
postpones for a time the effective enforcement of the contractual obligation, notwithstanding the obligation, under
the exact terms of the contract, remains lawful and possible of performahce after the passage of the statute as it
was before.
The rent cases--Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135; Marcus
Brown Co. v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170; Levy Leasing Co.
v. Siegel, 258 U.S. 242-which are here relied upon, dealt
with an exigent situation due to a period of sparcity of
housing caused by the war. I do not stop to consider
the distinctions between them and the present case or to
do more than point out that the question of contract im-

pairment received little, if any, more than casual consideration. The writer of the opinions in the first two
cases, speaking for this court in a later case, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 416, characterized
all of them as having gone "to the verge of the law."
It, therefore, seems portinent to say that decisions which
confessedly escape the limbo of unconstitutionality by
the exceedingly narrow margin suggested by this characterization should be applied toward the solution of a
doubtful question arising in a different field with a very
high degree of caution. Reasonably considered they do
not foreclose the question here involved, and it should
be determined upon its merits without regard to those
cases.
We come back, then, directly, to the question of impairment. As to that, the conclusion reached by the
court here seems to be that the relief afforded by the
statute does not contravene the constitutional provision
because it is of a character appropriate to the emergency
and allowed upon what are said to be reasonable conditions.
It is necessary, first of all, to describe the exact situation. Appellees obtained from appellant a loan of $3,800;
and to secure. its payment, executed a mortgage upon real
property consisting of land and a fourteen-room house
and garage. The mortgage contained the conventional
Minnesota provision for foreclosure by advertisement.
The mortgagors agreed to pay the debt, together with interest and the taxes and insurance on the property. They
defaulted; and, in strict accordance with the bargain, appellant foreclosed the mortgage by advertisement. and
caused the premises to be sold. Appellant itself bQught
the property at the sale for a sum equal to the amount of
the mortgage debt. The period of redemption from that
sale was due to expire on May 2, 1933; and, assuming no
redemption at the end of that day, under the law in force

290 US.

when the contract was made and when the property was
sold and in accordance with the terms of the mortgage,
appellant would at once have become the owner in fee and
entitled to the immediate possession of the property.
The statute here under attack was passed on April 18,
1933. It first recited and declared that an economic
emergency existed. As applied to the present case, it arbitrarily extended the period of redemption expiring on
May 2, 1933, to May 18, 1933-a period of sixteen days;
and provided that the mortgagor might apply for a further extension to the district court of the county. That
court was authorized to extend the period to a date not
later than May 1, 1935, on the condition that the mortgagor should pay to the creditor all or a reasonable part
of the income or rental value, .as to the court might appear just and equitable, toward the payment of taxes, insurance, interest and principal mortgage indebtedness,
and at such times and in such manner as should be fixed
by the court. The court to whom the application in this
case was made extended the time until May 1, 1935, upon
the condition that payment by the mortgagor of the rental
value, forty dollars per month, should be made.
It will be observed that whether the statute operated
directly upon the contract or indirectly by modifying the
remedy, its effect was to extend the period of redemption
absolutely for a period of sixteen days, and conditionally
for a period of two years. That this brought about a substantial change in the terms of the contract reasonably
cannot be denied. If the statute was meant to operate
only upon the remedy, it, nevertheless, as applied, had
the effect of destroying for two years the right of the
creditor to enjoy the ownership of the property, and consequently the correlative power, for that period, to occupy, sell or otherwise dispose of it as might geem fit.
This postponement, if it had been unconditional, undoubtedly would have constituted an unconstitutional

impairment of the obligation.

This court so decided in

Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, where the period of redemption
was extended for a period of only twelve months after a
sale under a decree; in Howard v. Bugbee, supra, where
the extension was for two years; and in Barnitz v. Beverly,
supra,where the period was extended for eighteen months.
Those cases, we may assume, still embody the law, since
they are not overruled.
The only substantial difference between those cases
and the present one is that here the extension of the
period of redemption and postponement of the creditor's
ownership, is accompanied by the condition that the
rental value of the property shall, in the meantime, be
paid. Assuming for the moment, that a statute extending the period of redemption may be upheld if something
of commensurate value be given the creditor by way of
compensation, a conclusion that payment of the rental
value during the two years' period of postponement is
even the approximate equivalent of immediate ownership and possession is purely gratuitous. How can such
payment be regarded, in any sense, as compensation for
the postponement of the contract right? The ownership
of the .property to which petitioner was entitled carried
with it not only the right to occupy or sell it, but, ownership being retained, the right to the rental value as well.
So that in the last analysis petitioner simply is allowed
to retain a part of what is its own as compensation for
surrendering the remainder. Moreover, it cannot be foreseen what will happen to the property during that long
period of time. The buildings may deteriorate in quality; the value of the property may fall to a sum far below
the purchase price; the financial needs of appellant may
become so pressing as to render it urgently necessary that
the property shall be sold for whatever it may bring..
However these or other supposable contingencies may
be, the statute denies appellant for a period of two years

482

290 U.S.

the ownership and possession of the property-an asset
which, in any event, is of substantial character, and
which possibly may turn out to be of great value. The
statute, therefore, is not merely a modification of the
remedy; it effects a material and injurious change in the
obligation. The legally enforceable right of the creditor
when the statute was passed was, at once upon default
of redemption, to become the fee simple owner of the
property. Extension of the time for redemption for
two years, whatever compensation be given in its place,
destroys that specific right and the correlative obligation,
and does so none the less though it assume to create in
invitum another and different right and obligation of
equal value. Certainly, if A should contract with B to
deliver a specified quantity of wheat on or before a given
date, legislation, however much it might purport to act
upon the remedy, which had the effect of permitting the
contract to be discharged by the delivery of corn of equal
value, would subvert the constitutional restriction.
A statute which materially delays enforcement of the
mortgagee's contractual right of ownership and possession does not modify the remedy merely; it destroys,
for the period of delay, all remedy so far as the enforcement of that right is concerned. The phrase, "obligation
of a contract," in the constitutional sense imports a legal
duty to perform the specified obligation of that contract,
not to substitute and perform, against the will of one of
the parties, a different, albeit equally valuable, obligation. And a state, under the contract impairment clause,
has no more power to accomplish such a substitution
than has one of the parties to the contract against the
will of the other. It cannot do so either by acting directly upon the contract, or by bringing about the result
under the guise of a statute in form acting only upon the
remedy. If it could, the efficacy of the constitutional restriction would, in large measure, be made to disappear.

As this court has well said, whatever tends to postpone
or retard the enforcement of a contract, to that eitent
weakens the obligation. According to one Latin proverb,
"He who gives quickly, gives twice," and according to
another, "He who pays too late, pays less." "Any
authorization of the postponement of payment, or of
means by which such postponement may be effected, is in
conflict with the constitutional inhibition." Louisiana
v. New Orleans, 102 U.S. 203, 207. I am not able to see
any real distinction between a statute which in substantive terms alters-the obligation of a debtor-creditor contract so as to extend the time of its performance for a
period of two years, and a statute which, though in terms
acting upon the remedy, is aimed at the obligation (as
distinguished, for example, from the judicial procedure
incident to the enforcement thereof) and which does in
fact withhold from the creditor, for the same period of
time, the stipulated fruits of his contract.
I quite agree with the opinion of- the court that whether
the legislation under review is wise or unwise is a matter
with which we have nothing to do. Whether it is likely
to work well or work ill presents a question entirely irrelevant to the issue. The only legitimate inquiry we can
make is whether it is constitutional. If it is not, its
virtues, if it have any, cannot save.it; if it is, its faults
cannot be invoked to accomplish its destruction. If the
provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they
pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be
abandoned. Being unable to reach any other conclusion
than that the Minnesota statute infringes the constitutional restriction under review, I have no choice but to
say so.

I am authorized to say that MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANand MR. JUSTICE BUTLER
