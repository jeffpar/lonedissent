Statement of the Case.

in this court. The matter was disposed of as one "hardly
requiring mention." Evidently the point most in the
mind of the court was the distinction relied upon, and
not the basic rule which was not contested. Both the
Hendrix and Jin Fuey Moy'cases are out of harmony with
the Rosen and Benson cases and with the views which
we have here expressed. In respect of the question here
under review, both are now overruled.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

concurs in the result.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS and MR. JUSTICE BUTLER are

of opinion that the judgment of the court below is right
and should be affirmed.
ORMSBY ET AL., EXECUTORS, v. CHASE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 101.

Argued November 15, 16, 1933.-Decided December 11,
1933.

1. Whether a claim for damages survives the death of the wrongdoer is determined by the law of the place of the wrong. P. 388.
2. By the law of New York, a right of action based upon a wrong
done there abates with the death of the wrongdoer. Held, an
action can not be maintained in a federal court in Pennsylvania
for such a wrong, when the action was not commenced until after
the death of the wrongdoer. P. 388.
3. The Pennsylvania survival statute (Laws 1921, No. 29, ยง 35 (b))
does not give to the plaintiff on a foreign cause of action any substantive right. P. 389.
4. No question of revivor is involved in this case. P. 389.
65 F. (2d) 521, reversed.

defendant in an action for damages.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

Mr. C. Brewster Rhoads, with whom Messrs. Laurence
H. Eldredge and Robert T. McCracken were on the brief,
for petitioners.
Mr. Edward J. Fox, with whom Mr. Edward J. Fox, Jr.,
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Frank G. Ormsby was a resident and citizen of Pennsylvania until his death June 14, 1926. He owned a
building in New York City in which he maintained dnd
operated a passenger elevator. Respondent was one of
his tenants, and October 17, 1925, the elevator, in which
she was being carried, fell, seriously injuring her. She
did not sue him, but, after his death, brought this suit
in the federal court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania against his executors to recover damages on account
of such injuries, alleging them to have been caused by
the negligence of deceased. The affidavit of defense alleged that plaintiff's cause of action abated with the testator's death. The district court so held. 3 F.Supp. 680.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 65 F. (2d) 521.
Plaintiff's statement of claim did not allege that her
right of action survived the death of the deceased. It
was not made to survive by any statute of New York, and
under the common law there in force did abate with his
death. Gorlitzer v. Wolfiberg, 208 N.Y. 475; 102 N.E.
528. Bernstein v. Queens County Jockey Club, 222 App.
Div. 191; 225 N.Y.S. 449.' She relies upon a Pennsylvania statute which declares that executors shall be liable
to be sued in any action which might have been maintained against the deceased if he had lived. Laws 1921,
No. 29, ยง 35 (b), p. 58. But the law of the place of the
wrong determines whether the claim for damages survives
the death of the wrongdoer. Orr v. Ahern, 107 Conn. 174;
Blackstone, c. 20, p. 302. United States v. Daniel, 6 How. 11, 13.

Syllabus.

139 AtI. 691. Sumner v. Brown, 312 Pa. 124; 167 Atl.
315. Davis v. Mills, 194 U.S. 451, 454.' Assuming
Ormsby's negligence as alleged, the New York law, upon
the happening of the accident, gave plaintiff a right of
action. But the same law limited the right and made it
to end upon the death of the tortfeasor. As actions for
personal injuries are transitory, she might have sued him
in Pennsylvania. Tennessee Coal, I. & R. Co. v. George,
233 U.S. 354. But when she sued she had no claim to
enforce. Hyde v. Wabash, St. L. & P. Ry. Co., 61 Ia,
441, 443; 16 N.W. 351. She could derive no substantive right from the Pennsylvania survival statute. See
Sumner v. Brown, supra. As there had been no suit,
no question of revivor is presented. Martin's Administrator v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 151 U.S. 673, 691, et
seq. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Joy, 173 U.S. 226. It
results, therefore, that the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals cannot be sustained.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS took no part in the consideration.
