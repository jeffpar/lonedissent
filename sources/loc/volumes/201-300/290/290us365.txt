their ancient grant are Indian country in the sense of
§ 217; that the United States, in virtue of its guardianship, has full power to punish crimes committed within
the limits of the pueblo lands by or against the Indians
or against their property--even though, where the offense
is against an Indian or his property, the offender be not
an Indian "--and that the statutes in question, rightly
construed, include the offense charged in the indictment.
There is nothing in the enabling act which makes
against the views here expressed. True, it declares, in
keeping with the constitutional rule, that the State shall
be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the
original States. But the principle of equality is not disturbed by a legitimate exertion by the United States of
its constitutional power in respect of its Indian wards and
their property. 5
As the District Court's judgment rested upon a mistaken construction of the statutes the judgment cannot
stand.
Judgment reversed.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These causes demand construction and application of
the provisions of § 219, Rev. Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat.
253, 275 (U.S.C., Title 26, § 960) copied in the margin,*
Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 275:
Sec. 219. (a) The tax imposed by Parts I and II of this title shall
apply to the income of estates or of any kind of property held in trust,
*

including-

. ..

(2) Income which is to be distributed currently by the fiduciary to
the beneficiaries, and income collected by a guardian of an infant which
is to be held or distributed as the court may direct; ...
(b) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (g) and (h), the
tax shall be computed upon the net income of thc estate or trust, and
shall be paid by the fiduciary. The net income of the estate or trust
shall be computed in the same manner and on the same basis as provided in section 212, except that- . . .
(2) There shall be allowed *as an additional deduction in computing
the net income of the estate or trust the amount of the income of the
estate or trust for its taxable year which is to be distributed currently
by the fiduciary to the beneficiaries, and the amount of the income
collected by a guardian of an infant which is to be held or distributed
as the court may direct, but the amount so allowed as a deduction
shall be included in computing the net income of the beneficiaries

which lay a tax upon "the income of estates or of any
kind of property held in trust," and direct that, (b) (2),
"There shall be allowed as an additional deduction in
computing the net income of the estate or trust the
amount of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable
year which is to be distributed currently by the fiduciary
to the beneficiaries, . . . but the amount so allowed as a

deduction shall be included in computing the net income of
the beneficiaries whether distributed to them or not. ..

."

Also, the identical provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926,
c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 32, 33; and the substantially similar ones
of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 838,
§§ 161 and 162.
In each cause the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
assessed the portion of the income from the trust created
by the husband's will which had been paid to the widow.
The trustees claimed credit therefor. The Board of Tax
Appeals approved the assessments. The Circuit Courts of
Appeals held otherwise.
Causes Nos. 75, 76 and 78 involve the same point of
law. The undisputed facts are similar and it will suffice
to state those of No. 75. The record in No. 77 presents
another question and the facts there will be set out.
No. 75
William B. Butterworth, resident of Pennsylvaiiia, died
October 5, 1921. After certain bequests, his will gave the
residue of the estate to respondents as trustees, with directions to pay the net income to the widow. She accepted
under the will and surrendered the rights granted her by
the state laws. During 1924 and 1925 the trustees paid
her the income from the trust. The aggregate of these
and antecedent payments was less than the estimated
whether distributed to them or not. Any amount allowed as a deduction under this paragraph shall not be allowed as a deduction under
paragraph (3) in the same or any succeeding taxable year.

HELVERING v. BUTTERWORTH.

Opinion of the Court,

value of her statutory rights in the estate. In order to
ascertain the taxable income of the trust, the respondents
claimed the right to deduct from the gross amount payments made to the widow. The Commissioner denied this
and the Board of Tax Appeals approved his action. The
court below reversed the judgment.
Prior to Warner v. Walsh, 15 F. (2d) 367, United States
v. Bolster, 26 F. (2d) 760, and Allen v. Brandeis, 29 F.
(2d) 363, the Commissioner ruled that distributions from
the income of a trust estate to the widow who elected to
take under her husband's will in lieu of her statutory
interest were taxable to her. These cases held that by
relinquishment of her rights, she came to occupy the position of the purchaser of an annuity. They decided that
payments to her were not subject to taxation until her
total receipts from the trust estate amounted to the value
of what she relinquished-her alleged capital. Thereafter, in similar cases, the Commissioner refused to give
credit to the trustee for such payments and thus the
present causes arose.
We cannot accept the reasoning advanced to support
the three cases just cited. The evident general purpose
of the statute was to tax in some way the whole income
of all trust estates. If nothing was payable to beneficiaries, the income without deduction was assessable to
the fiduciary. But he was entitled to credit for any sum
paid to a beneficiary within the intendment of that word,
and this amount then became taxable to the beneficiary.
Certainly, Congress did not intend any income from a
trust should escape taxation unless definitely exempted.
Is a widow who accepts the provisions of her husband's
will and receives part or all of the income from an established trust in lieu of her statutory rights a beneficiary
within the ambit of the statute? We think she is. It
is unnecessary to discuss her rights or position under
other circumstances. We are dealing with a tax statute
and seeking to determine the will of Congress.

OCTOBER TERM, L933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

When she makes her election the widow decides to
accept the benefits of the will with the accompanying
rights and liabilities. In no proper sense does she purchase an annuity. For reasons satisfactory to herself,
she expresses a desire to occupy the position of a beneficiary and we think she should be so treated.
The trustees in Nos. 75, 76 and 78 were entitled to the
credits claimed and the judgments of the courts below
therein must be affirmed.
Affirmed.
No. 77
Calvin Pardee, a resident of Pennsylvania, died March
18, 1923. His will provided-" I also give unto my said
wife an annuity of Fifty thousand Dollars ($50,000.), to
be computed from the date of my decease and to be paid
in advance in quarterly payments." The total amount
paid by the trustees to the widow under the will during
the tax years 1924 and 1925 and prior thereto did not
aggregate the value of the interest to which she would
have been entitled had she declined to take under the
will. When computing the taxable income of the estate
the trustees deducted the amounts paid to the widow,
claiming credit therefor under § 219. The Commissioner's refusal to allow this was sustained by the Board
of Tax Appeals. The court below ruled otherwise.
The annuity provided by the will for Mrs. Pardee was
payable at all events. It did not depend upon income
from the trust estate. She elected to accept this in lieu of
her statutory rights. She chose to assume the position of
an ordinary legatee. Section 213 (b) (3), Revenue Act of
1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 267, 268, exempts bequests from
the income tax there laid. Payments to Mrs. Pardee by
the fiduciary were not necessarily made from income.
The charge was upon the estate as a whole; her claim was
payable without regard to income received by the fiduciary. Payments to her were not distribution of income;

but in discharge of a gift or legacy. The principle applied
in Burnet v. Whitehouse, 283 U.S. 148 is applicable.
The Commissioner rightly refused to allow the credits
claimed by the trustee and the judgment of the court
below must be reversed.
Reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES, dissenting.

I agree with the opinion of the Court in Nos. 75, 76 and
78. I am unable to agree with the opinion in No. 77.
In that case, the testator created a trust for the benefit of
his wife, children, and grandchildren. The income of the
trust, by its express terms, was to be paid to his wife to
the extent of $50,000 a year. While the payment of this
annual amount was also charged on the principal of the
estate, resort could not be had to the principal if the income of the trust was sufficient. Johnston's Estate, 264
Pa. 71, 76; 107 Atl. 335. The widow was in every sense of
the word a beneficiary of the trust, and the amounts paid
to her out of the income of the trust were paid to her as a
beneficiary. These amounts were thus deductible by the
trustees, under the express provision of § 219 (b) (2) of
the Revenue Act of 1924, from the gross income of the
trust. As to this, I think it makes no difference whether
or not the widow was taxable on the amount of the income she received. The decision of the Circuit Court of
Appeals should be affirmed.
