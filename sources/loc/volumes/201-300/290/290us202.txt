"He sues for $3,000 and 12 per cent. damages and attorney's fees. Section 6155, supra, provides that the attorney's fees shall be taxed as costs, but it does not provide
that the 12 per cent. penalty shall be taxed as costs.
Therefore the amount in controversy was $3,360." Evidently, the court concluded because the state statute
directed that attorneys' fees should be treated as costs,
they were costs within the removal statute. Also, that
the prescribed damages were not costs since not so
declared.
But this view was rejected here in Sioux County v. National Surety Co., 276 U.S. 238, 241. We there held that a
statute which allowed attorneys' fees to be taxed as part
of the costs created a liability enforceable by proper judgment in a federal court; that the mere declaration of
the state statute could not alter the true nature of the
obligation.
In the state court the present respondent sought to enforce the liability imposed by statute for his benefit-to
collect something to which the law gave him a right. The
amount so demanded became part of the matter put in
controversy by the complaint, and not mere " costs" excluded from the reckoning by the jurisdictional and removal statutes.
The challenged judgment must be

mother had removed and in which it was sought to force additional contributions from the father by attachment of his local
property. P. 208 et seq.
2. By the law of Georgia, a decree in a divorce suit, fixing the permanent alimony that the husband must pay for the support and
education of his minor child, may be entered by consent of the

which the total divorce was granted. P. 209.
3. The provision which the Georgia law makes for permanent alimony for the child does not vest a property right in him, but is

in that suit confers jurisdiction over the minor's custody and

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

290 U.S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
On August 10, 1930, Sadie Yarborough, then sixteen
years of age, was living with her maternal grandfather,
R. D. Blowers, at Spartanburg, South Carolina. ,Suing
by him as guardian ad litem, she brought this actior*n a
court of that State to require her father, W. A. i arborough, a resident of Atlanta, Georgia., to make provision
for her education and maintenance. She alleged " that
she is now ready for college and is without funds and,
unless the defendant makes provision for her, will be denied the necessities of life and an education, and will be
dependent upon the charity of others."' Jurisdiction was
obtained by attachment of defendant's property. Later
he was served personally within South Carolina.
In bar of the action, W. A. Yarborough set up, among
other defenses, a judgment entered in 1929 by the Superior
Court of Fulton County, Georgia, in a suit for divorce
brought by him against Sadie's mother. He alleged that
by the judgment the amount thereafter to be paid by him
for Sadie's education and maintenance had been determined; that the sum so fixed had been paid; and that the
judgment had been fully satisfied by him. He claimed
that in Georgia the judgment was conclusive of the matter
here in controversy; that having been satisfied, it relieved him, under the Georgia law, of all obligation to
provide for the education and maintenance of their minor
child; and that the full faith and credit clause of the
Federal Constitution (Art. IV, ยง 1) required the South
Carolina court to give to that judgment the same effect in
this proceeding which it has, and would have, in Georgia.
The trial court denied the claim; ordered W. A. Yarborough to pay to the grandfather, as trustee, fifty dollars
monthly for Sadie's education and support; and to pay
'There was no suggestion that plaintiff would be destitute or become
a public charge. Indeed, her grandfather testified that he was able and
willing to provide $125 a month for her education and maintenance
(the amount sought by plaintiff), if her father was unable to do so.

$300 as fees of her counsel. It directed that the property
held under the attachment be transferred to R. D. Blowers,
trustee, as security for the performance of the order.
The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of
South Carolina. A petition for rehearing was denied,
with opinion. 168 S.C. 46; 166 S.E. 877. This Court
granted certiorari. 289 U.S. 718.
For sometime prior to June, 1927, W. A. Yarborough,
his wife and their daughter Sadie had lived together at
Atlanta, Georgia, where he then was, and ever since has
been, domiciled. In that month, Sadie's mother left
Atlanta for Hendersonville, N. C., where she -remained
during the summer. Sadie joined her there, after a short
stay at a camp. In September, 1927, while they were at
Hendersonville, W. A. Yarborough brought, in the Superior Court for Fulton County, at Atlanta, suit against
his wife for a total divorce on the ground of mental and
physical cruelty. Mrs. Yarborough filed an answer and
also a cross-suit in which she prayed a total divorce, the
custody of the child and " that provision for permanent
alimony be made for the support of the respondent and
the minor child above mentioned [Sadie], and for the
education'of said minor child." An order, several times
modified, awarded to the wife the custody of Sadie and,
as temporary alimony, sums "for the support and maintenance of herself and her minor daughter Sadie." Hearings were held from time to time at. Atlanta. At some
of these, Sadie (and also her grandfather) was personally present. But she was not formally made a party to
the litigation; she was not served with process; and no
guardian ad litem was appointed for her therein.
"Two concurring verdicts favoring a total divorce to
plaintiff having been rendered," 2 a decree of total divorce,
' ยง 2944 of the Georgia Civil Code (1910) provides: "Divorces may
be granted by the superior court and shall be of two kinds-total or
from bed and board. The concurrent verdict of two juries, at different terms of the court, shall be necessary to a total divorce."

1929; the wife was ordered to pay the costs; and jurisdiction of the case "was retained for the purpose of further
enforcement of the orders of the court theretofore
passed." I Among such orders, was the provision for the
maintenance and education of Sadie here relied upon as
res judicata. It was entered on January 17, 1929 (after
the rendition of the first verdict), and provided:
"Parties, plaintiff and defendant, having personally in
writing, consented hereto, and their respective counsel of
record having likewise consented in writing hereto,
"It is considered, ordered and adjudged that the following settlement be hereby made the order of the Court, the
same being in full settlement of temporary and permanent alimony in said case, and in full settlement of all
other demands of every nature whatsoever between the
parties."
Then followed, after describing certain mortgages:
" It is considered, ordered and adjudged that said
mortgages be, and they are hereby transferred, sold and
assigned by the plaintiff, W. A. Yarborough to the defendant, Mrs. Susie B. Yarborough to the extent of One

the close of school hours Friday until Sunday night of said week ends,

of the allotted time."

Opinion of the Court.

of One Thousand, Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars
($1,750.00) ....
The amount to be thus received by
R. D. Blowers as Trustee for Sadie Yarborough, minor
daughter of plaintiff and defendant, shall be expended by
him in his discretion for the benefit of the minor child,
including her education, support, maintenance, medical
attention and other necessary items of expenditure.
"Upon compliance with this order by the plaintiff, he
shall be relieved of all payments of alimony and counsel
fees, in said case, except that the payment due under the
prior order of Court of the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00)
for the month of January, 1929, [to Mrs. Yarborough for
the support of herself and Sadie] shall be by him paid,
in addition to the other amounts hereinbefore
named ...
"The provisions of the order of the Court heretofore
entered fixing the times and the places when plaintiff,
W. A. Yarborough, shall have the right to visit and have
with him, out of the presence of the defendant, the said
Sadie Yarborough, minor daughter of plaintiff and
defendant, are hereby continued in force."
W. A. Yarborough complied fully with this order.
By the law of Georgia, it is the duty of the father to
provide for the maintenance and education of his child
until maturity.' Wilful abandonment of a minor child,
leaving it in a dependent condition, is a misdemeanor.,
The mere loss of custody by the father does not relieve him
of his obligation to provide for maintenance and education, even where the custody passes to the mother pursuant to a decree of divorce.' If the father fails to make
such provision, any person (including a divorced wife)

who furnishes necessaries of life to his minor child, may
recover from him therefor, unless precluded by the terms
of the decree in the divorce suit or otherwise.' In case of
total divorce, the court is authorized to make, by its decree,
final or permanent provision for the maintenance and education of children during minority, and thus fix the extent
of the father's obligation. 8 But even if the decree for
total divorce fails to include a provision for the support of
minor children, they cannot maintain in their own names,
or by guardian ad litem, or by next friend, an independent

202

Opinion of the Court.

$1,750 to be "expended by him in his discretion for the
benefit of the minor child, including her education, support, maintenance, medical attention and other necessary
items of expenditure " was not intended to relieve the
father from all further liability to support Sadie. This
contention appears to have been abandoned. It is clear
that Mrs. Yarborough, her husband and the court intended that this provision should absolve Sadie's father
from further obligation to support her. That the term
"permanent alimony" as used in the decree of the
Georgia court, means a final provision for the minor child
is shown by both the legislation of the State and the
decisions of its highest court.10 The refusal of the South
Carolina court to give the judgment effect as against
Sadie is now sought to be justified on other grounds.
Second. It is contended that the order or decree providing for Sadie's permanent support is not res judicata because it did not conform to the provisions of the Georgia
law. The argument is that the controlling statute required such an order to be entered after the second or
final verdict; and "that since the order was entered before
the second verdict and was not mentioned in it, the order
was unauthorized and is void. The Georgia decisions
have settled that a consent decree or order fixing permanent alimony for a minor child, at whatever stage of the
divorce proceedings it may have been entered, has the
same effect as if based upon, and specifically mentioned
in, the second verdict of a jury; " and that such an order,

court fixing the allowance upon the terms stated in the decree. This
consent having been approved by the court in which the cause was

like any other judgment, becomes unalterable after the
expiration of the term. 2
Third. It is contended that the Georgia decree is not
binding upon Sadie, because she was not a formal party
to the suit, was not served with process and no guardian
ad litem was appointed for her therein. In Georgia, as
elsewhere, a property right of a minor can ordinarily be
affected by legal proceedings only if these requirements
are complied with."3 But the obligation imposed by the
Georgia law upon the father to support his minor child
does not vest in the child a property right. This is shown
by the fact, among other things, that the minor cannot
maintain in his own name, or by guardian ad litem or by
next friend, a suit against his father to enforce the obligation.14 The provision which the Georgia law makes of
permanent alimony for the child during minority is a
legal incident of the divorce proceeding. As that suit
embraces within its scope the disposition and care of
minor children, jurisdiction over the parents confers eo
ipso jurisdiction over the minor's custody and support.
Hence, by the Georgia law, a consent (or other) decree in
a divorce suit, fixing permanent alimony for a minor child
is binding upon it, although the child was not served with
process, was not made a formal party to the suit, and no
guardian ad litem was appointed therein.'
pending after grant of the divorce, the court loses control over the
subject, and the decree stands as other jadgments against the husband."

YARBOROUGH v. YARBOROUGH.
202

Opinion of the Court.

Fourth. It is contended that the order for permanent
alimony is not binding upon Sadie because she was not a
resident of Georgia at the time it was entered. Being a
minor, Sadie's domicile was Georgia, that of her father; 16
and her domicile continued to be in Georgia until entry
of the judgment in question. She was not capable by
her own act of changing her domicile." Neither the temporary residence in North Carolina at the time the divorce suit was begun,1" nor her removal with her mother
to South Carolina before entry of the judgment, effected
a change of Sadie's domicile."9 It is true that, under the
Georgia Code, a minor may acquire a domicile apart from
the father if he has "voluntarily relinquished his parental
authority." But the mere fact that the parents were
living separately at the time the suit for divorce was
brought and that Sadie was with her mother, does not
Compare Anderson v.
establish such relinquishment."
Watt, 138 U.S. 694, 706. The character and extent of the
father's obligation, and the status of the minor, are determined ordinarily not by the place of the minor's residence but by the law of the father's domicile. 2' Moreover, this is not a case where the scope of the jurisdiction
acquired by the Georgia court rests upon the effectiveness
of service by publication upon a nonresident. Mrs. Yarborough filed a cross-bill, as well as an answer; and in the
cross-bill prayed "that provision for permanent alimony
be made for the" support and education of Sadie. Thus

the court acquired complete jurisdiction of the marriage
status and, as an incident, power to finally determine the
extent of her father's obligation to support his minor

child. 1
Fifth. The fact that Sadie has become a resident of
South Carolina does not impair the finality of the judgment. South Carolina thereby acquired the jurisdiction
to determine her status and the incidents of that status.
Upon residents of that State it could impose duties for her
benefit. Doubtless, it might have imposed upon her
grandfather who was resident there a duty to support
Sadie. But the mere fact of Sadie's residence in South
Carolina does not give that State the power to impose such
a duty upon the father who is not a resident and who long
has been domiciled in Georgia.2" He has fulfilled the duty
which he owes her by the law of his domicile and the judgment of its court. Upon that judgment he is entitled to
rely."4 It was settled by Sistare v. Sistare, 218 U.S. 1,
that the full faith and credit clause applies to an unalterable decree of alimony for a divorced wife. The clause

applies, likewise, to an unalterable decree of alimony for a
minor child.2" We need not consider whether South Carolina would have power to require the father, if he were
domiciled there, to make further provision for the support,
maintenance, or education of his daughter.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE, dissenting.
I think the judgment should be affirmed.
The divorce decree of the Georgia court purported to
adjudicate finally, both for the present and for the future,
the right of a minor child of the marriage to support and
maintenance, by directing her father to make a lump sum
payment for that purpose. More than two years later,
after the minor had become a domiciled resident of South
Carolina, and after the sum paid had been exhausted, a
court of that State, on the basis of her need as then shown,
has rendered a judgment directing further payments for
her support out of property of the father in South Carolina, in addition to that already commanded by the
Georgia judgment.
For present purposes we may take it that the Georgia
decree, as the statutes and decisions of the State declare,
is unalterable and, as pronounced, is effective to govern
the rights of the parties in Georgia. But there is nothing
in the decree itself, or in the history of the proceedings
which led to it, to suggest that it was rendered with any
purpose or intent to regulate or control the relationship
of parent and child, or the duties which flow from it, in
places outside the State of Georgia where they might later
come to reside. It would hardly be thought that Georgia,
by judgment of its courts more than by its statutes, would
attempt to regulate the relationship of parents and child
domiciled outside of the State at the very time the decree

was rendered; and, in the face of constitutional doubts that
arise here, it is far from clear that its decree is to be interpreted as attempting to do more than to regulate that
relationship while the infant continued to be domiciled
within the State. But if we are to read the decree as
though it contained a clause, in terms, restricting the
power of any other state, in which the minor might come
to reside, to make provision for ier support, then, in the
absence of some law of Congress requiring it, I am not
persuaded that the full faith and credit clause gives sanction to such control by one state of the internal affairs of
another.'
Congress has said that the public records and the judicial proceedings of each state are to be given such faith
and credit in other states as is accorded to them in the
state " from which they are taken." R.S. ยงยง 905, 906;
28 U.S.C.A., ยงยง 687, 688. But this broad language has,
never been applied without limitations. See McElmoyle
v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312. Between the prohibition of the
due process clause, acting upon the courts of the state
from which such proceedings may be taken, and the mandate of the full falth and credit clause, acting upon the
state to which they may be taken, there is an area which
federal authority has not occupied. As this Court has
often recognized, there are many judgments which need
not be given the same force and effect abroad which they
'It may be assumed for present purposes that the child was sufficiently represented in the Georgia proceedings. But the point is
doubtful. See Walder v. Walder, 159 La. 231; 105 So. 300; Graham
v. Graham, 38 Colo. 453; 88 Pac. 852. The reasoning of the opinion
of the Court-that since Georgia does not give the child a cause of

action it has no property right and need not have been representedwould lead to the conclusion that what was decided in Georgia was
something quite different from that which was in litigation and decided in South Carolina; that the child's suit is upon a right afforded
only by the law of South Carolina; and that the Georgia suit, giving

no similar righ, but only a right to the mother, could have no effect
upon the present litigation.

have at home, and there are some, though valid in the
state where rendered, to which the full faith and credit
clause gives no force elsewhere. In' the assertion of rights,
defined by a judgment of one state, within the territory
of another, there is often an inescapable conflict of interest of the two states, and there comes a point beyond
which the imposition of the will of one state beyond its
own borders involves a forbidden infringement of some
legitimate domestic interest of the other. That point
may vary with the circumstances of the case; and in the
absence of provisions more specific than the general terms
of the congressional enactment 2 this Court must determine for itself the extent to which one state may qualify '
or deny " rights claimed under proceedings or records of
other states.
' The mandatory force of the full faith and credit clause as defined
by this Court may be, in some degree not yet fully defined, expanded
or contracted by Congress. Much of the confusion and procedural

deficiencies which the constitutional provision alone has not avoided
may be remedied by legislation. Cook, Powers of Congress under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause, 28 Yale Law Journal, 421; Corwin, The
"Full Faith and Credit" Clause, 81 University of Pennsylvania Law
Rev. 371; cf. 33 Columbia Law Rev. 854, 866. The constitutional
provision giving Congress power to prescribe the effect to be given to
acts, records and proceedings would have been quite unnecessary had
it not been intended that Congress should have a latitude broader
than that given the courts by the full faith and credit clause alone.
It was remarked on the floor of the Constitutional Convention that
without the extension of power in the legislature, the provision " would
amount to nothing more than what now takes place among all Independent Nations." Hunt and Scott, Madison's Reports of the Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503. The play which has
been afforded for the recognition of local public policy in cases where
there is called in question only a statute of another state, as to the
effect of which Congress has not legislated, compared with the more
restricted scope for local policy where there is a judicial proceeding,
as to which Congress has legislated, suggests the Congressional power.

A statute, record or judgment of one state, establishing
the right of an illegitimate or adopted child to inherit
from his putative parent, may be given extra-state effect
for many purposes, but it does not establish his right to
inherit land in another state. See Hood v. McGehee, 237
U.S. 611; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U.S. 386. Parties who
have, in one state, litigated the proper construction of a
will disposing of realty are not, by the judgment there,
concluded in another state where the testator's realty is
located. Cf. Clarke v. Clarke, 178 U.S. 186. Nor will
a divorce decree seeking to apportion the rights of
the parties to realty be conclusive with respect to land
outside the state. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1. The interest of a state in controlling all the legal incidents of real
property located within its boundaries is deemed so complete and so vital to the exercise of its sovereign powers of
government within its own territory as to exclude any
control over them by the statutes or judgments of other
states.
It would be going farther than this Court has been willing to go in any decision to say that the power of a state
to pass judgment upon the sanity of its own citizen could
be foreclosed by an earlier judgment of the court of some
other state dealing with the. same subject matter. Cf.

Jurisdictional requirements being satisfied, the decree is
effective to end the marriage for all states, but enforcemnent of its prohibition against remarriage in another
state, even though the parties do not take up their residence there, would infringe upon the interest which every
state has to maintain the stability of a union entered into
according to the laws of the place of celebration."

not recognize the validity of the later marriage. Wilson v. Cook,

before remarrying, Pierce v. Pierce, 58 Wash. 622; 109 Pac. 45.
Thus the divorce proceedings, on the one hand, and the marriage
record, on the other, are denied full credit. See Beale, Laughlin,
Guthrie and Sandomire, Marriage and the Domicil, 44 Harvard Law
Rev. 501; 16 Minnesota Law Rev. 172. The present case is not
distinguished by arguing that in the divorce situation it is a question
of faith and credit to be given to a statute and not to judicial proceedings. Goodwin v. Goodwin, 158 App. Div. 171, 173; 142 N.Y.
Supp. 1102. While it is usually a statute that prescribes the disability
which is to attach to the divorce, it is the judicial proceedings themselves which are in question, as much as in the present case, where the
judgment for support is "unalterable within the state by virtue of the
Georgia statute. Without denying the validity of a marriage in another
state, the privileges flowing from marriage may be subject to the local
law. State v. Bell, 7 Baxt. 9 (Tenn.) (husband and wife of different
races may be prohibited from cohabiting within state though lawfully
married elsewhere); Restatement of Conflicts of Law, ยง 181.

Whatever view may be held of the particular restrictions upon the operation of the full faith and credit clause
in these cases, the validity of the principle upon which
they rest has never been denied. Its valdity is likewise
recognized in those cases where this Court has held that
the Fourteenth Amendment denies to a state the power of
unduly extending its authority beyond its own borders,
by the mere expedient of rendering a judgment against
one of whose person or property it has acquired jurisdiction. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U.S. 149;
Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U.S. 397. Just as due
process of law will not permit a state, by its judgment,
to inflict parties "with a perpetual contractual paralysis"
which will prevent them from altering outside of the state
their contracts or ordinary business relations entered into
within it, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, supra, 161, so
full faith and credit does not command that the obligations attached to a status, because once appropriately
imposed by one state, shall be forever placed beyond the
control of every other state, without regard to the interest
in it and the power of control which the other may later
acquire. See Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Olapper, 286
hiolding that certain statutory successors to corporations in a foreign
state shall have the privilege of maintaining suit, Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U.S. 243; Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U.S. 516, illustrates
the appropriate function of this Court in balancing the interests of
local and foreign sovereign. The extrastate force given to a voluntary
assignment in receivership, as compared with the more restricted
effect. of an assignment which is commanded by court order, further
demonstrates the nature of the full faith and credit mandate. See

U.S. 145, 157, n. 7. Whatever difference there may be between holding that a judgment is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it is "extra-territorial," and
in holding that it is not entitled to full faith and credit
although it does not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment,
is one of degree, or of a difference in circumstances which
may prevent the operation of the latter provision of the
Constitution. The Georgia judgment with which we are
now concerned does not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, for Georgia had " jurisdiction " of the parties and
subject matter at the time its judgment was rendered.
The possibility of conflict of the Georgia judgment with
the interest of South Carolina first arose when the minor
transferred her domicile to South Carolina, long after the
Georgia judgment was given.
The question presented here is whether the support and
maintenance of a minor child, domiciled in South Carolina, is so peculiarly a subject of domestic concern that
Georgia law can not impair South Carolina's authority.
The subject matter of the judgment in each state is the
duty which government may impose on a parent to support a minor child. The maintenance and support of
children domiciled within a state, like their education and
custody, is a subject in which government itself is deemed
to have a peculiar interest and concern. Their tender
years, their inability to provide for themselves, the importance to the state that its future citizens should be
clothed, nourished and suitably educated, are considerations which lead all civilized countries to assume some control over the maintenance of minors. 2 The states very
" This control is particularly important in the case of the children
of divorced couples. They are usually young; in Maryland over 60%
are under ten years of age when d~vorce occurs. Divorces are often
not contested and the intervention of a disinterested judge is frequently nominal. Allowances for children in the divorce court are
typically small. Marshall and May, The Divorce Court, 31, 79-80, 82,

generally make some provision from their own resources
for the maintenance and-support of orphans or destitute
children, but in order that children may not become public charges the duty of maintenance is one imposed primarily upon the parents, according to the needs of the
child and their ability to meet those needs. This is usually
accomplished by suit brought directly by some public officer,18 by the child by guardian or next friend, or by the
mother, against the father for maintenance and support."
The measure of the duty is the needs of the child and the
ability of the parent to meet those needs at the very time
when performance of the duty is invoked. Hence, it is no
answer in such a suit that at some earlier time provision
was made for t6e child, which is no longer available or
"Frequently a criminal statute provides as an alternative penalty
for nonsupport of a child that the guilty party post a bond or otherwise provide for the future support of the child. Such a statute exists
in South Carolina, ยง 1123 South Carolina Code, 1932, cf. Mason's
1927 Minn. Stat. ยง 10136. The state's special interest in securing the
father's liability is emphasized not only by the frequency of penal
measures, but also by the fact that in some places a statute is necessary before any suit can be maintained against the father. Huke v.
Huke,. 44 Mo. App. 308; Rawlings v. Rawlings, 121 Miss. 140; 83

support is correlative with the right to custody and services. See
Jacobs, Cases on Domestic Relations, 772.
"The duty of support is also enforced through entertaining suits by
third parties to recover for necessaries furnished. However, conflicting policies make this an unsatisfactory method, for the courts seek to
discourage wrongful action on the part of wives or minors in leaving
their homes and have consequently gdne to some lengths in refusing
to impose liability on the father unless he has been at fault in breaking up the home. Baldwin v. Foster, 138 Mass. 449; see Mihalcoe v.

In view of the universality of these principles it comes
as a surprise that any state, merely because it has made

Even though the Constitution does not deny to Georgia
the power to indulge in such a policy for itself,' it by no
means follows that it gives to Georgia the privilege of prescribing that policy for other states in which the child
comes to live."9 South Carolina has adopted a different
policy. It imposes on the father or his property located
within the state the duty to.support his minor child domiciled there. It enforces the duty by criminal prosecution 20

SIn the custody cases a very similar situation is presented. As

conventionally stated, the rule has been that the most the full faith
and credit clause can require is that the prior ruling shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of an asserted change in circumstances. See
Calkins v. Calkins, 217 Ala. 378; 115 So. 866; cf. People ex rel.
Allen v. Allen, 105 N.Y. 628; 11 N.E. 143; aff'g 40 Hun 611. In one
state a distinction has been drawn between personal rights of the
paients and the interest of the state in the welfare of the child: unless
there is an allegation that the best interest of the child requires a
change in custody the parties will be bound. Wear v. Wear, 130

the conclusion to be drawn from them. Commonwealth ex rel. Rogers

an abject surrender as this Court now requires of South Carolina.
A tendency may be discerned to give conclusive force to the determinations of the state wherein the child resides, as long as that residence
continues, but to hold that upon change of residence the questions will
be open in the state to which the change is made. Ex parte Erving,

and also permits suit by the minor child maintained by
guardian ad litem. The measure of the duty is the present need of the child and the ability of the parent to provide for i t. In this case the suit was begun by attachment
of the father's property in South Carolina and by personal
service of process, upon him there. The court found that
the lump sum paid for support of the child under the
Georgia decree had been expended; that she was justifiably residing with her mother in South Carolina rather
than with her father in Georgia; that she was then without financial resources and that, considering her station in
life and the circumstances of her father, an allowance for
the future of $50.00 a month for her education, maintenance and support would be fair and just; and this
amount was ordered to be paid for that purpose from the
attached property.
The opinion of this Court leaves it uncertain whether
it is thought that the Constitution commands that the
duty of support prescribed by Georgia, the domicile of
the father, shall be dominant over that enjoined by South
Carolina, the domicile of the child, in any event, or orly
after the duty has been defined by a judgment of Georgia."'

Amendment, at least, does not prevent the state of the

Kansas v. Wellman, 102 Kan. 503; 170 Pac. 1052; Ohio v.
Sanner, 81 Ohio St. 393; 90 N.E. 1007. The Fourteenth
Amendment does not enable a father, by the expedient
of choosing a domicile other than the state where the
child is rightfully domiciled, to avoid the duty which that
state may impose for support of his child. The reason
seems plain. The locality of the child's residence must
see to his welfare. While it might be more convenient
for creditors of the father to look to the law of his residence as fixing all his obligations, it would seem that the
compelling interest in the welfare of children, to which
performance of the duties of parentage is a necessary
incident, outweighs commercial convenience; the more so
where, as in this case, the obligation is to be satisfied from
the father's property within the state of the child's
domicile.
The conclusion must be the same when the issue is that
of the credit to be given the prior Georgia judgment.
Whatever may be said of the local interest which was
deemed controlling in those cases in which this Court has
denied to a state judgment the same force and effect outside the state as is given to it at home, it would not seem
open to serious question that every state has aa interest
in securing the maintenance and support of minor children- residing within its own territory so complete and
so vital to the performance of its functions as a government, that no other state could set limits upon it. Of
that interest, South Carolina is the sole mistress within
her own territory. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, 615.
Even though we might appraise it more lightly than does
South Carolina, it is not for us to say that a state is not
free, within constitutional limitations, to regard that interest as fully as important and as completely within
the realm of state power as the legal incidents of land
located within its boundaries, or of a marriage relationship, wherever entered into but of which it is the domicile,

or its power to pass upon the sanity of its own residents,
notwithstanding the earlier pronouncements of the courts
of other states.
The case of Sistare v. Sistare, 218 U.S. 1, seems to have
no bearing, on the question presented here. There the
plaintiff in error procured in the courts of New York a
judgment of judicial separation awarding alimony for
herself and child at a weekly rate. Leave was given to her
by the judgment to apply for such orders as might be necessary for its enforcement or her protection. Her husband
failed to pay the alimony, and she brought suit against
him in the courts of Connecticut for the past due alimony
which had accrued under the judgment. Upon an examination of the New York law this Court concluded that the
judgment was final as to all past alimony and that the
effect of it was to create a debt in New York, collectible
there by execution, for all past due installments, and it
held that the full faith and credit clause required the
Connecticut courts to render a like judgment. The Court
was careful to distinguish the case from one where the suit
was brought to compel the payment of alimony in the
future, see p. 16, compare Lynde v. Lynde, 181 U.S. 183,
187. The record discloses that neither party to the suit
was domiciled in Connecticut. The wife relied on the
New York judgment, as did the husband, whose only defenses were based on its effect in New York as not there
conferring on her an unqualified right to the alimony.
The Court Was not asked, and did not assume, to pass upon
the duty of the husband to support the wife or children
independently of the New York judgment. No question
whether the enforcement of the New York decree in Connecticut would infringe the authority of Connecticut to
regulate or control the incidents of a marriage, one or both
of the parties to which were then domiciled in the state,
was either raised or considered.
The decision in Sistare v. Sistare lends no support to the
contention that South Carolina can be precluded by a

judgment of another state from providing for the future
maintenance and support of a destitute child domiciled
within its own borders, out of the property of her father,
also located there. Here the Georgia decree did not end
the relationship of parent and child, as a decree of divorce
may end the marriage relationship. Had the infant continued to reside in Georgia, and had she sought in the
courts of South Carolina to compel the application of
property of her father, found there, to her further maintenance and support, full faith and credit to the Georgia
decree applied to its own domiciled resident might have
required the denial of any relief. Cf. Bates v. Bodie, 245
U.S. 520; Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551. But
when she became a domiciled resident of South Carolina, a
new interest came into being,-the interest of the State of
South Carolina as a measure of self-preservation to secure
the adequate protection and maintenance of helpless members of its own community and its prospective citizens.
That interest was distinct from any which Georgia could
conclusively regulate or control by its judgment, even
though rendered while the child was domiciled in Georgia.
The present decision extends the operation of the full faith
and credit clause beyond its proper function of affording
protection to the domestic interests of Georgia and makes
it an instrument for encroachment by Georgia upon the
domestic concerns of South Carolina.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO concurs in this opinion.
