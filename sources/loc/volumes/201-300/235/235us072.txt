UNITED STATES v. BARTLETT.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 251.

Argued October 22, 1914.-Decided November 16, 1914.

The act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, extending to April 26,
1931, the period of restriction upon the alienation of certain Indian
allotments, contained an excepting clause declaring that "nothing
herein shall be construed as imposing restrictions removed by or
under any prior law;" held that restrictions which had been terminated by lapse of time as contemplated by the law imposing them
were "removed from the land by or under" a prior law within the
meaning of the excepting .clause.
203 Fed. Rep. 410, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the act of
May 27, 1908, extending restrictions on alienation of Indian allotments, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, with whom
Mr. S. W. Williams was on the brief, for the United States:
By the act of May 27, 1908, Congress meant to provide
against the alienation, prior to April 26, 1931, of any
allotment then held by any member of any of the Five
Civilized. Tribes of full or three-quarters Indian blood,

UNITED STATES v. BARTLETT.
235 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

excepting only such allotments as had been or as might
thereafter be specifically relieved of restrictions, by the
action of the Secretary of the Interior or of Congress itself.
The act of May 27, 1908, should be construed, in pari
materia with other acts which will be cited, as the expression of a definite policy to abolish the divergencies and
remedy the defects of the various agreements under which
the allotments in the Five Civilized Tribes had been made,
by classifying all the allotments, irrespective of tribe,
according to the degree of the presumed natural competency of the allottees, standardized arbitrarily in accordance with their respective proportions of Indian blood;
and by relieving the restraints altogether as to those thus
classified as competent, and by forbidding conveyances by
those thus classified as incompetent prior to April 26, 1931.
Both the spirit and the letter of the act of May 27,
1908, demand that all the lands of the three-quarter blood
Indians be held restricted until April 26, 1931, irrespective
of the prior restrictions.
That part of the first section of the act of May 27,
1908, which declares that the act shall not be construed
"to impose restrictions removed from land by or under
any law prior to the passage of this act," refers only to
those cases in which restrictions have been removed by
the direct action of Congress or by the Secretary of the
Interior from particular allotments.
The opposite construction would render this clause
repugnant to the plain terms classifying three-quarter
bloods as incompetent in respect of all of their land and
to the fundamental purpose of the statute to protect the
incompetent Indians.
The clause may readily be construed in avoidance of
this result and in harmony with the statute as a whole by
confining it to the special cases above mentioned.
If doubt exists, this construction should be adopted as
the more beneficial to the Indians.

Congress had power to place a new restriction upon
the land in controversy, as was done by the act of May 27,
1908. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 301.
The imposition of restrictiors upon the alienation of
Indian allotments is but a mode of exercising the power
of guardianship still residing in the United States respecting the Indians. Until the guardianship shall have been
renounced, Congress may modify its plans and correct its
mistakes. If it has given the Indians a liberty too large
for their own good, Congress may curtail it. The renewal
of an expired restriction stands upon the same ground as
the extension of one which has still some time to run.
The power to extend existing restrictions and the power
to impose new restrictions where none exist-one and
the same in quality and purpose-are derived from the
guardianship of the Federal Government over the Indians.
The power to reimpose restrictions is entirely consistent
with the possession by the individual Indian of rights
which are constitutionally protected from interference
by Congress. He may not be arbitrarily deprived of any
vested right of property. But the protection of his property is a legitimate and necessary exercise of the power of
guardianship, subject to which his property is held, and
the imposition of a restraint upon his liberty of disposi-,
tion is a necessary and legitimate means of protecting his
property.
The power to protect the property of an Indian ward,
being a power of the General Government, is not to be
diminished or impaired in its full usefulness by the circumstance that the property has been tentatively subjected to the taxing power of a State, but the right of
the State of Oklahoma to continue taxing the land in
controversy is not involved, and could not constitute a
defense in the present case.
The power to reimpose restrictions is consistent with

235 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

the full protection of all rights in the land which may
have become vested in third persons while the allottee
was free to convey.

Mr. George S. Ramsey, with whom Mr. Edgar A. de

The act of May 27, 1908, disclaimed intention to again
restrict sale of any land from which restrictions had been
removed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Appellees.

235 U. S.

As the constitutionality of the act of May 27, 1908, is in
grave doubt, it should be construed so as to avoid constitutional question.
The title of the act is to remove restrictions, and in
case of doubt as to construction the title of an act can
be considered.
If the act is intended to declare all three-quarter bloods
incompetent and to restrict the sale of any land then free,
there was no reason for its operation to be suspended for
sixty days.
The clause pertaining to restrictions on mixed-bloods
of three-quarter or more Indian blood had a wide field for
operation, excluding the Creek Nation.
The restrictions on Moses Wiley and all mixed-blood
Creeks, irrespective of fractional quantum of Indian
blood, were removed under a law, to-wit: § 16 of act of
Congress approving Supplemental Creek Agreement.
If the construction of the act is in doubt-then the
construction, insisted on by the Government should be
rejected, because it is unjust and infringes upon the State's
right to tax the lands after the act, though they were subject to state taxation before.
If the act put restrictions on land then free it is unconstitutional. The Government abandoned its guardianship
over unrestricted lands.
Personally, the Indians were granted statehood .by the
Oklahoma Enabling Act, and with respect to their persons
and unrestricted lands and all other property are on an
equality, civilly and politically, with all other citizens
of the State, and have as citizens of the United States
and Oklahoma the same exemptions from Federal control,
enjoyed by citizens of any other State.
When Congress once permitted lands to become free
from restrictions, the Indian being a full fledged citizen
of the State, the guardianship over all the unrestricted
property of that Indian ceased, whether that property

235 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

was acquired by gift, purchase, inheritance, or allotmentwhen once free, always free.
Congress having permitted the State's power to tax to
vest, is conclusive evidence that Congress abandoned its
guardianship over that land, and there is no power in the
Federal Government to withdraw it from full dominion of
the State. In support of these contentions; see act of
May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312; Supplemental Creek Treaty,
32 Stat. 500; Cherokee Agreement, 32 Stat. 716; Supplemental Choctaw and Chickasaw Treaty, 32 Stat. 641.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a suit to cancel two deeds of land allotted to an
enrolled citizen of the Creek tribe of Indians. The land
is what is known as surplus, as distinguished from homestead, land, and the allottee is of three-fourths Indian
blood. The allotment was made under the act of June 30,
1902, 32 Stat. 500, c. 1323, known as the Supplemental
Creek Agreement, which provided in § 16 that the land
should be inalienable by the allottee or his heirs for a
period of five years, expiring as it is said in the briefs,
August 8, 1907. In 1912 the allottee deeded the land to
Bartlett, one of the appellees, and shortly thereafter
Bartlett deeded it to Lashley, the other appellee. These
are the deeds sought to be cancelled and the right to that
relief is rested upon a provision in § 1 of the act of May 27,
1908, 35 Stat. 312, c. 199, declaring that "all allotted
lands of . . . enrolled mixed-bloods of three-quarters
or more Indian blood

.

.

.

shall not be subject to

alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other
incumbrance prior to April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred
and thirty-one," etc. As the original restriction upon
alienation expired several months before the passage of
the act of 1908, and also long before the deed from the
allottee to Bartlett, the important question in the case
is whether Congress intended by the act of 1908 to re-

UNITED STATES v. BARTLETT.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

impose and extend that restriction in respect of allotments which theretofore had been entirely freed from it
through the expiration of the period prescribed for its
existence. The District Court, adhering t 9 an opinion
given in another case (187 Fed. Rep. 870, 873), answered
the question in the affirmative, and the Circuit Court of
Appeals, concluding that the answer should be the other
way, directed that the bill be dismissed. 203 Fed. Rep.
410.
If taken literally, the language which we have quoted
from the act of 1908 is doubtless broad enough to embrace
all allotments of the class described whether then subject
to the original restriction or theretofore freed from it.
But that language, is not to be taken literally, for it is
followed by a declaration that "nothing herein shall be
construed to impose restrictions removed from land by or
under any law prior to the passage of this act." That this
declaration is intended to qualify or restrain what precedes it is conceded, but to what extent is the subject of
opposing contentions.
Under prior legislation the lands of the Five Civilized
Tribes, including those of the Creeks, had been allotted in
severalty, all subject to restrictions upon alienation which
were to be terminated by the lapse of varying periods of
time. As to some of the lands these periods had expired,
thereby lifting the restrictions. In some instances Congress had abrogated the restrictions in advance of the
time fixed for their termination, and in still other instances
they had been cancelled by the Secretary of the Interior
in the exercise of authority conferred by law. But as to
most of the lands the restrictions were still in force. It was
in this situation that Congress, by the act of 1908, extended or enlarged the period of restriction in respect of
"all allotted lands of . . . enrolled mixed-bloods of
three-quarters or more Indian blood" Tnd accompanied
its action with an explanation that it was not intended to

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court,

235 U. S.

impose restrictions theretofore "removed from any land by
or under any law."
The real controversy is over the meaning of the word
"removed."
It is not questioned that it embraces the
action of Congress and of the Secretary of the Interior in
abrogating or cancelling restrictions in advance of the
time fixed for their expiration, but it is insisted that it
does not embrace their termination by the lapse of time.
In short, the contention is that the word is used in a
sense which comprehends only an affirmative act, such as
a rescission or revocation while the statutory period was
still running. Although having support in some definitions of the word, the contention is, in our opinion,
untenable, for other parts of the same act, a4 also other
acts dealing with the same subject, show that the word is
employed in this legislation in a broad sense plainly including a termination of the restrictions through the
expiration of the prescribed period. This is illustrated
in §§ 4 and 5 of the act of 1908 and § 19 of the act of
April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, 144, and is recognized
in Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, 673, where, in dealing
with some of these allotments, it was said that "restrictions on alienation were removed by lapse of time."
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the con-

sideration and decision of this case.
