MINIDOKA & SOUTHWESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITE D STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 19.

Argued October 29, 30, 1914.-Decided November 30, 1914.

Under the policy of the Government to encourage the building of railroads in the western States, Congress has in some cases granted land
to aid in construction and has also provided the means by which
those, companies not having such grants can, under reasonable coniditions, acquire rights of way over public lands.
While the right.of way statute only applies to public lands and, therefore, does not apply to lands segregated from the public domain bv
homestead efitries, settlers may, under § 2288, Rev. Stat., grant right.
of way over land before final proof.
Nothing inthe Reclamation Act Qf June i7, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, affects
the provision of § 2288, Rev. Stat., permitting a homesteader without patent, but in lawful possession, to grant to a railroad company
a right of way across his claim.
The privileges for granting to railroad companies rights of way over
homesteaders' land under entry were renewed and extended by the
act of March 3, 1905, c. 1424, 33 Stat. 991.
In this case, held that the various acts of Congress in effect operated to
give the consent of the United States to the construction of a railroad
as an instrumentality of commerce across the lands of those homesteaders within the limits of the Minidoka Irrigation Project in
Idaho who gave deeds for the right of way to the railroad company.
190 Fed. Rep. 491, reversed, and 176 Fed. Rep. 762, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of acts of
Congress regarding railroad rights -of way and the right
of entrymen within the reclamation projects to deed rights
of way for railroads, are stated in the opinion.

poses expressly given to homestead settlers by § 2288, Rev.
Stat., is not impaired by the provisions of the Reclamation
Act.
The lands in question were not public lands and there
was no authority under the general right of way act of
1875 for the filing or approval of a map of definite location
affecting them.
The right of way granted by the homestead settlers
under the authority of § 2288 is complete and perfect. The
statute itself operates as the consent of the Government
to subject its interest in the land to the right of way
during the life of the homestead entry and also after forfeiture of the homestead.
The dictum of. the Circuit Court of Appeals that the
general right of way act requires the filing of a profile of
the road rather than a map of alignment or definite
location is contrary to the practice of nearly forty
years.

should not be adjudged to exist unless plainly conferred
by some act of Congress.
The act of March 3, 1873, as amended, does not empower the entrymen to authorize the construction of arailroad through a reclamation project without the con-"
sent of the Secretary of the Interior.
The act merely authorizes the settler to relinquish in
part the privileges which he enjoys under the settlement
law, not to convey the title or to impair in any. way the
interest of the Government.
As to lands which, like the lands of reclamation projects, are affected by a special public interest, the act of
March 3, 1873, if applicable at all, should be construed
as a means of securing the consent of the settler to the
uses mentioned, but not to permit- those uses in the
absence of governmental approval.
Construed in pari materia with the Reclamation Act,
the act of March 3, 1873, as amended, can be deemed
operative only in so far as consistent with the proper
management and welfare of such projects. This necessarily implies that the transfers of the settlers must
remain ineffectual if not approved or if objected to by
the Government through the Secretary of the Interibr.
Under the statute no vested right arises against the
Government until a map showing the railroad location
has been filed with and approved by the Secretary of the
Interior.
The withdrawn lands were excluded from the operation
of the statute by the terms of the statute itself.
Independently of its own express provisions, which require approval by the Secretary and exclude lands specially reserved, the act of 1875, when construed in pari
materia with the Reclamation Act, does not authorize railroad construction in .reclamation projects against the
objection of the Secretary of the Interior.

MINIDOKA R. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.

The Minidoka & Southwestern Railroad Company was
authorized by its charter to build its road along a line
which ran through the Minidoka Irrigation Project in the
State of Idaho. Homesteaders, without patents but lawfully in possession of irrigable land within the reclamation
area, granted rights of way over their settlements to the
Railroad Company.
When the Company began to build the United States
sought to enjoin the work on the ground that a railroad
could not be built across lands within a reclamation area
without the consent of the Government. It was also
claimed that the necessary embankments, excavations,
bridges and culverts would interfere with the success of
the irrigation works. The Company answered and relied
on the conveyances from the homesteaders. After a
hearing the District Court denied the injunction but made
provision that the culverts should be so built as not to
interfere with the flow of water through the canals and
ditches (176 Fed. Rep. 762). This decree was reversed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals (190 Fed. Rep. 491) on
the ground that the lands in the reclamation area, though
in possession of settlers, were public lands within the
meaning of the Right of Way Act (March 3, 1875, c. 152,
18 Stat. 482) and that before its road could be built
through the Minidoka Irrigation works the Company must
obtain the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. From
that decree an appeal was taken to this court.
It has always been the policy of the Government to encourage the building of railroads in the Western States,
and many land grants have been made by it to aid in their
construction. Congress has also provided a means by
which those companies having no such grants could acquire rights of way over any portion of the public land by
filing a map of definite location and securing its approval

by the Secretary of the Interior (18 Stat. 482)._ This law,
however, by its very terms applies only to "public lands"
and hence cannot be construed to empower the Secretary
to authorize the building of roads across lands which had
been segregated from the public domain by the entry and
possession of homesteaders or preemptors. Bardon v.
Northern Pac., 145 U. S. 535, 538; United States v. Buchanan, 232 U. S. 72, 76, and cases cited. On the other
hand, settlers, without patent, were not in a position to
make deeds to rights of way, not only because they had
no title but also because they were prohibited fromh alienating such land before final proofs. Rev. Stat., § 2291. The
consequence was that neither the Government nor the
homesteaders could make such grants, and as the Company could not build without an assured title to its right
of way, it was practically impossible to construct railroads
through territory which consisted partly of public lands
and partly of that which was in the possession of settlers.
But it was greatly to their interest and to that of the Gov.
ernment that such a highway should be constructed and
in order to meet the difficulty, Congress, on March 3,
1873, c. 266, 17 Stat. 602 (Rev. Stat., § 2288), passed an
act providing that any bona fide settler might convey by
warranty against his own act any part of his claim "for
church, cemetery, or school-purposes or for the right of way
of railroads." Under this act the appellant could have constructed its road along the strip conveyed to it by the
homesteaders unless, as claimed by the Government, the
provisions of Rev. Stat., § 2288 as amended (March 3,
1905, c. 1424, 33 Stat. 991) have been repealed as to lands
within irrigation projects and the completed Minidoka
Irrigation Works.
Counsel for the United States contend that the Reclamation Act (June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388) requires that
when an irrigation project is undertaken the Secretary of
the Interior shall define its limits and withdraw all the

MINIDOKA R. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

irrigable land therein from the public domain and from
the operation of the general land laws: It is argued that
when thus withdrawn the irrigation area constitutes a
unit in which the United, States has such a special interest
as to require that it shall be subject to the supervision of
the Secretary-he, in order to secure the success of the
undertaking, having it in his power to decide whether a
railroad should be built, and if so, along what line and
across what lots it should be constructed. It is also argued that settlers having no patents ought not to be in a
position to grant a right of way over lands which they do
not own and may never acquire and thereby impose a
burden upon the claim if it should afterwards come into
the hands of other homesteaders.
These considerations, however, have not induced Congress to change its policy of encouraging the construction
of railroads along- routes designated by charters and over
land in the possession of settlers. Neither have they in-duced Congress to confer upon the Secretary the power to
grant rights of way through irrigation lands in the possession of homesteaders.
It is true that the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902
(c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388), provides that when the Secretary of
the Interior determines upon an irrigation project he must
define its limits and "withdraw the irrigable lands therein
from all forms of settlement, except under the homestead
law," and all settlements therein shall be "subject to the
limitations, charges, terms, and conditions provided in the
Reclamation Act." And it is.further true that the provisions of this, statute do, in several important respects,
modify the homestead law. The Secretary can limit the
size of the homestead to ten acres, instead of the 160 acres
permitted by the general law. The settler, instead of
being entitled to receive a patent at the end of 5 years on
compliance, with the statutory conditions (Rev. Stat.,
§§ 2289-2291), is not permitted to make final proof and

receive a patent until he has reclaimed one-half of the
irrigable area for agricultural purposes, and has also paid
his proportionate share of the cost of the irrigation system
in instalments,-the last of which may not mature for ten
years after entry.
There are, possibly, other provisions to meet the special
conditions of lands constituting an irrigation plant. But
except as modified by the specific terms of the Reclamation
ActI such lands are distinctly made subject to entry under
the provisions of the homestead law, and all of the homesteaders' -rights therein are the same as if the settlement
had been located outside of the limits of irrigation works.
One of ihe privileges, not affected by the Reclamation
Act, is that which permits the homesteader, without patent, but in -lawful possession, to grant to a railroad company a right of way across his claim; and whatever reason
there was for conferring this right upon those who entered
land in a sparsely settled section is doubly operative as to
land located within the more thickly populated reclamation areas. Manifestly this is true as to so much as may
be needed for churches and school houses. It is equally so
as to rights of way for railroads and other public utilities
needed by the numerous residents living within the irrigation areas.
An actpassed shince the Reclamation Act of .1902 serves,
if possible, to make clearer the fact that Congress did not
intend to deprive settlers on these or any other class of
lands from granting railroad rights of way. For on
March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 991), after the establishment of the
Minidoka Project, Congress amended Rev. Stat., § 2288
so as to provide that "any bona fide settler under the preemption, homestead, or other settlement law shall have the
right to transfer, by warranty against his own acts, any
portion of his claim for church, cemetery, or school purposes, or for the right of way of railroads, telegraph, telephone, canals, reservoirs, or ditches. . . ." These

privileges were renewed and extended by this act because
of the public benefits to be derived from such utilities.
When, therefore, the Minidoka & Southwestern Railroad
Company, in 1909, secured grants to.the continuous strip
through the reclamation area, the Company, by virtue
of these public statutes and the private grants, was authorized to construct its road not only across the agricultural lands, but over the intervening ditches and canals.
For, while the latter formed a part of the irrigation unit,
they were also particularly appurtenant to the lands
through and along which they ran.
These various acts of Congress operated to give its consent, in advance, to the construction of such a highway
and instrumentality of commerce, notwithstanding any
interest the United States may have had in the lands described in the deeds from the homesteaders to the Railroad
Company.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and
that of the Circuit Court for the District of Idaho is
affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 216.

Argued February 24, 25, 1914.-Decided November 30, 1914.

No hard and fast rule has as yet been announced as to how far the court
will go in passing upon questions raised in habeas corpus proceedings.
Barring exceptional cases, the general rule is that on applications for
habeas corpus, the hearing is confined to the single question of jurisdiction, and even that will not be decided in every case.
The hearing on habeas corpus is not in the nature of a writ of error, nor
is it intended as a substitute for the functions of the trial court.
