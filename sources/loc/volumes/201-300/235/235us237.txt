UNITED STATES v. BALEN.
235 IT.S.

Statement of the Case.

UNITED STATES v. SALEN.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 506.

Argued October 23, 1914.-Decided November. 30, 1914.

The suppression clause in the declaration required to be made by agentconsignees of imported goods by sub-section 6 of § 28 of the Tariff
Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 95, relates to the omission of
matter proper to be included in the invoice and Account attached,
and not to independent facts.
In construing a provision of the Tariff Act relating to entry of merchandise, courts should consider the purpose of such provision in the
light of the customs regulations applicable to such entry; and in this
case this court will not say that one of. a number of acts required to
be done related to undefined extraneous general matter when all of
theother acts related to partieular defined subjects connected with
the importation.
The meaning of words is affected by their context; and words used in a
highly penal statute will be interpreted in a narrower sense as referring to things of the same nature as those described in an enunerated list, although standing alone they might have a wider meaning.
This limited interpretation given to sub-section 6 of § 28 of the Tariff
Act of 1909 does not mean that Congress has deprived the collector
of means of obtaining extraneous information, as there are other
statutory provisions for examinations of the owner, consignee or
agent for that purpose.
A statute such as the suppression clause,-sub-section 6 of § 28 of the
Tariff Act of 1909,-will not be so interpreted as to Bpread a net that
might catch the unwary as well as the guilty, or in a manner contrary
to the fixed rules of interpretation, by making it relate to unenumerated matters as well as those enumerated, thus fixing no standard
by which to draw the line between innocent silence and felonious
concealment:
SALEN

was indicted for making false statements in the

sworn declaration required of Consignees by the Tariff
Act of 1909. August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 93. The
first five counts charged that in entering laces in February,

235 U. S.

1910, and January and February, 1913, he had falsely
sworn that the Consular invoices attached were the only
invoices covering the shipments, when he well knew that
there were others in existence. The court overruled the
demurrer to these counts and they are not involved in
this case.
The sixth count related to a Declaration made by Salen
on March 17, 1913, in making an entry of foreign laces
covered by Consular Invoice No. 7893. Salen was therein
charged with having fraudulently concealed from the
Collector the existence of certain material facts and
thereby had falsified the required statement in the sworn
declaration "that nothing has been on my part, nor to my
knowledge on the part of any other. person, concealed or
suppressed, whereby the United States may be defrauded
of any part of the duty lawfully due on the said goods."
This count sets out at great length and in narrative form
certain evidentiary facts which may be thus summarized:
Salen was the New York agent and primary consignee
of Goetz, a French exporter, who, for eight years, had
been shipping laces to Salen for sale and delivery to Robinson, the purchaser and ultimate consignee.
When the last consignment arrived in New York, Salen
presented the declaration to the Collector, attaching
thereto, as required by law, the bill of lading; a list or
entry account of the goods; and the consular invoice
No. 7893. He paid the duty assessed on the basis of the
foreign values as given in the invoice, and thereupon removed the goods and delivered them to Robinson the
purchaser. This count of the indictment further charged
that Salen knew that the foreign values had been falsely
and fraudulently stated in the previous invoices; that
such foreign values named in those invoices was uniformly
greatly below the prices at which the laces were sold i the
United States; that in making the Declaration as to the
shipment represented by Consular Invoice No. 7893,

UNITED STATES v. SALEN.
235 U, S.

Argument for United States.

Salen concealed the fact that it was one of the series of
shipments in which Goetz and Robinson had fraudulently
concealed the great and uniform discrepancy between the
foreign values named in the invoices and the prices at
which the lace was sold in the United States.
It was charged that this concealment was the suppression of a fact by which the United States may have been
defrauded of its lawful duty, for if Salen had communicated the facts the Collector would have called for a
reappraisement of the laces and their undervaluation
would have been disclosed.
The defendant demurred on the ground that there was
no positive averment that the goods were undervalued
but only an argumentative statement of facts the existence
of which did not raise the legal conclusion that there was
any undervalation and that the count failed to charge
facts sufficient to constitute an offense under sub-section
6 of § 28 of the act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 95,
or any other statute of the United States. The demurrer
was sustained on the ground that the facts stated did not
constitute an offense under the statute, and the case was
then brought here by the Government under the Criminal
Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat., 1246.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for the United
States:
The case is properly before this court under the Criminal Appeals Act.
The penalties imposed by customs law are intended for
the prevention of fraud, the protection of the revenue,
and the protection of honest importers. The act should
be so construed as to give effect to this intention in general
and to the evident intent of Congress in particular to
require of the importer, by means of the provisions of
sub-section 5, the observance of the highest degree of
good faith toward the Government.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for United States.

235 U. S.

The words "nothing has been concealed or suppressed,"
as used in sub-section 5, do not mean nothing has been
concealed or suppressed in. the entry and invoice. The
history of. the statute shows that Congre~s had intended
to make the scope of the declaration a wide one, and to
impose an obligation not to suppress or conceal anything
(whether in the entry and invoice or not), which might
tend to defraud the United States of duties.
One knowing certain facts which would have influenced
any ordinary reasonable man acting as collector, in investigating or ordering an investigation or appraisement
or reappraisement of values, and concealing such knowledge on his part, certainly conceals "something" and
swears falsely when he makes oath that "nothing has been
concealed or suppressed by him."
The importer's duty of disclosure to the Government is
an obligation uberrim, fidei as broad as that imposed
upon the insured in marine insurance.
Whether a knowledge of prior fraudulent shipments
constitutes a suppression of "nothing" may be tested by
considering whether the party could have been examined
under oath regarding such knowledge, on a summons
under sub-section 15 of the act which gives the appraiser
and. collector a power to examine "touching any matter or
thing which they may deem material."
It may also be tested by considering whether evidence
that such party knew of prior frauds in undervaluation
would be admissible if he should be indicted for perjury in swearing to the present declaration that the invoice produced by him exhibits the actual market
value, etc.
It is not necessary to allege in the indictment or to prove
that the United States was actually defrauded of duties.
It is only necessary to allege facts calculated .to deprive,
or of a character which might deprive, the United States
of such duties.

UNITED STATES v. SALEN.
235 U. S.

Argument for United States.

Proof of an intent to defraud is-not required by subsections 5 and 6 to be alleged or proved. All that is necessary is (a) a false statement, (b) knowingly made--. e.,
made with knowledge of its falsity.
The statement in the declaration was "material thereto,"
i. e., material to the declaration.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

235 U. S.

Mr.° Marion Erwin, with whom Mr. Frederick M.
Czaki was tn the brief, for defendant in error:
Sub-sect on 6 is either a perjury statute, or, at least,
one in the nature of a perjury statute. It is highly penal.
See act of March 1, 1823, § 4; Rev. Stat., § 2841; United
States v. Auffmordt, 122 U. S. 197, 204; Customs' Administration Acts of June 10, 1890, 26 Stat. 132; August 5,
1900, 36 Stat. 94.
The suppression referred to relates wholly to things
concealed or suppressed in the written entry and invoice.
It obviously means things relating to the character,
quantity," quality or cost of'the goods, or other facts concealed or suppressed which should have been fairly stated
in the invoice or written entry constituting the representation, and by the acceptance of which the collector
might be deceived, and thus the United States might be
defrauded. United States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430.
Rev, Stat., § 2839, was repealed by the Customs Adminis trative Act of June 10, 1890. In its place was substituted
sub-section 6 which prescribed punishitent or forfeiture
for making "any' false statement in the declaration
material thereto.
The indictment in the case at bar does not charge that
the goods entered were manufacturer's goods. But if it
did, there was norequirement that the selling price in this
country should be disclosed. Notwithstanding these
changes in the statute, 'the Auffmor'dt decision is as
pertinent now as it was then on the point, thata disclosure
of things relating to values at other times and places not
provided to be disclosed by the forms prescribed-such as
the value or selling price in this country-are not within
the purview of the statute, and hence cannot be made the
basis of forfeiture much less of criminal prosecution for
suppression. They are not "material" to the declaration.
United States v. Cargo of Sugar, 3 Sawyer, 46.
The things alleged to have been suppressed were not

material to the declaration within the meaning of the
statute; nor is there any averment that defendant had
been called upon under sub-sections 15 or 11 to make
disclosures of the facts charged to have been suppressed.

v. Calhoun, 184 Fed. Rep. 499, 504; Gulbenkian v. United
States, 153 Fed. Rep. 858.
The importer is not guilty of a criminal offense under
sub-section 9 even though the entry is based upon invoices in which the consignor has falsely and fraudulently
misstated the cost or values, unless the importer knows or
believes that they are so false and fraudulent, and even
though the use of such false entry and invoice should
result in depriving the United States of a portion of its
duties. United States v. 1150 Pounds of Celluloid, 82

United States, 160 V. S. 325.
Suppression by which the United States may be defrauded is limited to things Within the scope of the disclosures required to be made in the stereotyped form of
declaration and papers attached, constituting the representation.
There can be no fraud without a representation, express
or implied, where there is a duty or obligation imposed
upon the party to speak. For definition of "fraud" see
Black's Law Dict.; 20 Cyc. 10; 19 Cyc. 403.
This court will not give the statute a construction which
would place deelarants in such an unfair situation, and
make, the statutory forms prescribed a snare to entrap
those who rely upon their sufficiency. Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197, 214.

Words used in a statute by which they are not defined
are given the same meaning as at common law. Swearingen v. United States, 161 U. S. 446, 451; Keck v. United

18 Wall. 237, 253.
The omission, in the suppression clauses in forms
(1) .and (2) of sub-section 5, of the words "in the said
entry or invoice," was not intended to enlarge the scope
of those clauses beyond the meaning of the suppression
clause of forms (3) and (4). Lawrence v. Allenj 7 How.

Charges of suppression of a belief in the happening of a

U. S.370, 397; United States v. Kissel, 218 U. S.601, 606.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
This writ of error raises the question as to whether the
suppression clause in the declaration, required to be made
by agent consignees of imported goods (36 Stat. 95), relates to the omission of matter proper to be included in
the invoice and account attached ;-or to independent
facts which, if brought to the attention of the Collector,

UNITED STATES v. SALEN.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the ?ourt.

would have excited his suspicion and induced him to
institute a special inquiry as to the value of the merchandise mentioned in the account and invoice.
No case directly in point has been cited; but counsel
have traced the history of the clause from the act of 1799,
which required only one form of declaration from all importers, through the subsequent statutes, which, like the
Tariff Act of 1909, provide for slightly different forms,
according as the entry is made by owner, manufacturer,
consignee, or agent. (1 Stat. 627, 656; 3 Stat. 729, 730;
22 Stat. 488, 524; 26 Stat. 131, 132; 36 Stat. 11, 93.)
Under the act of 1799 every importer had to attach the
consular invoice and entry account and swear that he
"had not in the said entry or invoice concealed or suppressed anything" whereby the Government might be
defrauded of its duty. This clause is still retained in the
form required to be signed by owner and manufacturer.
Where the goods are entered by an agent consignee he
makes Declaration that "nothing has been on my part,
nor to my knowledge on the part of any other person,
concealed or suppressed, whereby the United States may
be defrauded of any part of the duty lawfully due on
the said goods, wares, and merchandise." Much of the
argument was addressed to the effect of this difference in
the language in the respective forms of the several declarations. 36 Stat. 93-95.
Counsel for Salen insist that this difference is due to
the fact that the suppression clause in the consignee's
declaration was included in a sentence all the terms of
which related to invoice and entry. The declaration to
be signed by owner and manufacturer (36 Stat. 94, 95)
was in two sentences, and as the last of the two contained
the suppression clause, it was necessary, from a grammatical point of view, to mention invoice and account- as
antecedents. It is argued that the owner's statement ionveyed the same meaning as was otherwise expressed in

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

the suppression clause of the consignee's declaration. On
the other hand the Government contends that the difference in phraseology indicated an, intent to require the
consignee to disclose matters as to which no requirement
was made where the goods were entered by owner or
manufacturer.
Congress, of course, could have legislated in the same
statute so as to make a distinction between consignor and
consignee. But no satisfactory reason is given why Congress should have imposed no penalty upon an owner for
concealing a great and uniform difference between invoice
values and selling prices, while at the same time making
the agent guilty of a felony for suppressing exactly the
same fact. The moral quality of the act was the same
whether the concealment was by owner or agent; the
result to the Government was the same, and all doubtful
or ambiguous language, in a statute covering the same
subject, should be construed on the natural supposition
that Congress required identity of disclosures and provided identity of punishment for identity of concealment.
In arriving at the meaning of the clause on which this
indictment is founded it may be helpful to consider the
purpose of the statute, in the light of the Customs Regulations applicable to the entry of foreign merchandise at a
domestic port.
Foreign value is the basis on which ad valorem duties
are imposed (36 Stat. 101, § 18), and Congress has made
various provisions to enable collectors and appraisers to
obtain infokmation as to such foreign values. To that
end it authorizes them to examine all. importers or consignees under oath so as to secure from them a statement
of.any facts which might shed light on the amount of
duty to be paid. Any false statement made oR such examination subjects them to indictment and punishment
as for a felony (June 10, 1890, c. 407, 26 Stat. 131, 139,
§§ 16, 17).

UNITED STATES v. SALEN.
235 U. S.

247,

Opinion of the Court.

But the Documents attached to the Declaration are.
the primary source of information as to value. They consist of a Consular Invoice, [prepared by the consignor,
showing a list of the goods and their foreign value at the
date of exportation]; an Entry' or Account, [prepared by

the consignee, showing marks, number,

contents, quan-

tity, invoice value, dutiable value, and the rate of, duty
of the goods, Customs Regulations, 217] and also the
Bill of Lading, [prepared by the Master of the vessel].
If these three papers, prepared by three different persons,

'have been truly and correctly made they contain all the
information needed to assess the duties. In view therefore of the importance of these Documents the statute
makes specific provisions' by which they are to be verified,
and as will appear from an analysis of the 'declaration
(36 Stat. 93), the consignee states in the first sentence

of the Declaration;
1 DECLARATION OF CONSIGNEE, IMPORTER, OR AGENT, WHERE MER-

CHANDISE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY PURCHASED.

Opinion of the Court.

said invoice, or in the account now rendered, he will immediately make the same known to the Collector, . .
It will be seen that the Declaration was not only intended to secure an affirmative statement as to the
genuineness of the documents and of the correctness of
what was actually therein set out, but the consignee was
also required to make a negative averment that nothing
had been suppressed or concealed by himself or, so far
as he knew, by any one else-that is, nothing had been
suppressed or concealed in the Account [preptred by the
consignee]; in the Consular Invoice [prepared by the exporter]; or in the Bill of Lading [prepared by the Master
of the vessel]. Seven of the eight clauses distinctly related
to Documents. To say that the sixth clause in this enumeration was intended to embrace undefined extraneous
matter, would be to suddenly depart from the particular
to the general and back again from the general to the
particular ;-from the particular subject of Documents,
to which the attention of the affiant had been specially
directed by the first five clauses, into a general field of
wide and indefinite scope and-in the seventh clauseagain to return to the particular subject ot Documents.
.Such an interpretation would give an exceedingly liberal
construction to a statute defining a felony. It wold ignore the fact that the meaning of* words is affected by
their context and violate the settled rule that words which
standing alone might have a wide and comprehensive
import will, when joined with those defining specific acts,
be interpreted in their narrower sense and understood to
refer to things of the same nature as those described in
the associated list, enumeration or class. Cf. Virginia v.
Tennessee, 148'U. S. 503, 519; United States v. Chase, 135
U. S. 255, 258; Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 708.
The fact that under this rule the general language of
the suppression clause is to be restricted to the Documents to which al the other clauses in the sentence refer,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

does not, of course, mean that Congress has deprived
the Collector of the means of obtaining information as
to extraneous facts that might assist him in passing upon
questions of value or in determining whether there had
been any violation of the tariff law.
But the method by which that information is to be
obtained is the examination of the owner, consignee or
agent under oath, 26 Stat. 139; 36 Stat. 100, §§ 15, 16;
Customs Regulations, 1908, § 865. The very fact that
provision ts made for such examination is itself a clear
indication that there may be material matter, not proper
for inclusion in the declaration, but which might still be
important in the assessment of the duty. But to say
that in signing the statutory form of declaration consignee should in effect answer specific questions and at
thcr same time be required on peril of committing a felony
to disclose extraneous evidentiary facts as to which no
direct question was asked and to which his attention was
not directed is to make the declaration serve a purpose
for which it was not intended and spread a net that might
catch the unwary as well as the fraudulent consignee.
United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 221. For, under the
contention of the plaintiff in error, it is not necessary that
Salen should have intended to defraud or that the Government should have 'been actually defrauded. The
crime was committed if the United States "may have
been defrauded." So that even if the foreign value on
which the duty was assessed had been truly stated in
thai declaration, the consignee would yet be guilty of a
felony if he failed to call attention to facts which would
have excited the Collector's suspicion and induced him
to demand a reappraisement. Such an interpretation of
