McGOVERN, ADMINISTRATRIX, v. PHILADELPHIA & READING RAILWAY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 430. Argued November 30, 1914.-Decided December 14, 1914.
Where appellants, plaintiffs below, had a verdict on the first trial which
was set aside on motion for new trial on which the District Court discussed questions arising under treaties and ruled adversely to plaintiffs, and on the second trial the court ruled adversely to plaintiffs under the Federal statute, this court will presume that the
court also considered the treaty questions, and a direct appeal will
lie to this court based on the construction and application of the
treaty.
In deciding Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 213 U.,S.
268, which came here on writ of error from the state court, this court
simply accepted the ruling of the state court that a non-resident alien
could not maintain an action for death of a relative under the state
statute, as being the construction by the highest court of the State of
that statute.
After reviewing the rulings of many jurisdictions in regard to the right
of non-resident aliens to maintain actions for death of relatives under
statutes giving the right, held that the weight of authority in this
country and in England is that alienage is not a condition affecting
right of recovery under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
Quwre, whether under the favored nation provision in the existing treaty
with Great Britain and the express provision in the treaty with Italy
permitting Italian aliens, non-resident in the United States, to maintain actions in the courts of the United States and of the States, a
citizen of Great Britain has a treaty right to maintain an action for
the death of a relation under the Federal Employers' Liability Acts
of 1908 and 1910.
In this case, held, that in view of the conflict of evidence as to the circumstances under which the intestate was killed, the question of
assumption of risk was properly presented to the jury.
Where there has been a verdict for plaintiff and it has been set aside on
the ground that plaintiff has not capacity to sue, and on the second

trial a verdict directed for defendant on that ground, the Circuit
Court of Appeals cannot reverse and direct judgment on the original
verdict even if the plaintiff waives a jury trial; the case must be sent
back for new trial.
Judgment based on 209 Fed. Rep. 975, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Federal Employers' Liability Acts of 1908 and 1910, and the
right of non-resident aliens to maintain actions thereunder,
and also questions involving rights under the favored nation clause of the treaty with Great Britain, are stated
in the opinion.
Mr. George Demming for plaintiff in error:
This court has jurisdiction. Nichols Lumber Co. v.
Franson, 203 U. S. 278; Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475;
Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425.
Non-resident- aliens can benefit under the provisions of
the Act of Congress of April 22, 1908. See Maiorano v.
Balt. & Ohio R. R., 213 U. S. 268; affirming 246 Pa. St.
402; and see Deni v. Penna. R. R., 181 Pa. St. 525; Balt. &

v. Great Northern Ry., 161 Fed. Rep. 239; Fulco v. Schuylkill Stone Co., 163 Fed. Rep. 124.
Maiorano v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., 213 U. S. 268, .distinguished, as since that decision there has been a new treaty
with Italy, of February 25, 1913, and Pennsylvania has
passed an .act permitting non-resident aliens to recover
in Pennsylvania in like cases.
Under the terms of the treaties between the United
States and foreign countries, especially with Italy and
with Great Britain, plaintiff in error can recover.
Because of the most favored nation clause the terms of
the treaty with Italy would be held to apply to subjects
of Great Britain and Ireland.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

If a new rule of law was promulgated by the new treaty
with Italy it went back and covered all cases, which,
though originating before, nevertheless had not been tried
and decided up to that time.
Treaties are construed with regard to the intention as
well as with reference to justice and convenience. The
Amistad, 15 Pet. 518, 591, 595; United States v. Texas,
162 U. S. 1; Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424.
A treaty is to be construed in the light of all the facts
and circumstances surrounding its making. In re Ross, 140
U. S. 453; United States v. Schooner "Peggy," 1 Cranch,
103.
Even ignoring the treaties between the United States.
and Italy and the doctrine of the most favored nation
clause, plaintiff in error has the right to bring the present
suit and to recover therein by reason of direct treaty rights
and provisions between the United States and Great
Britain and Ireland. See Arts. II and V of the treaty of
March 2, 1899, with Great Britain.
A treaty is the supreme law of the land, binding alike
national and state courts, and is capable of enforcement,
and must be enforced by them in the litigation of private'
rights. Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536; Tucker
v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424.
A treaty should be liberally construed, De Geofrey v.
Riggs, 133 U. S. 258, and if it admits of two constructions
the more liberal one is to be preferred. Hauenstein v.
Lynham, 100 U. S. 483; 2 'Herod' on Favored Nation
Treatment, p. 9; Hall's Int. Law, pp. 350-355 (4th Ed.).
See also Chambers v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., 207 U. S. 142,
150; Maiorano v. Balt. & Ohio R. R. Co., supra.
Within the broad intent of this treaty such a right of
action for the death is the personal property of the heirs.
As to what is property see Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S.
700, 738; Seaman v. Clarke, 69 N. Y. Supp. 1002; Power v.
Harlow, 57 Michigan, 107, 111; Battishell v. Humphreys,

Schouler, Personal Property, 3d ed., §§ 11-15, 58; 32

This is plain, no matter what theory of the origin of the
suit for death by negligence is accepted. Mich. Cent. R. R.
v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 67.
While in this country rights of foreigners to real estate
and immovable property rest primarily in the laws of the
State where such. property is situated, Hauenstein v.
Lynham, 100 U. S. 483; Blythe v. Hinckley, 180 U. S. 333,
this law does not apply to personal estate, but aliens
have full power and right in this country to succeed
thereto. McLearn v. McClellan, 10 Pet. 625, 637.
By international law and the law of comity and reciprocity between nations this plaintiff should be allowed
to recover.
International law is undoubtedly part of the law of
this land. 2 Butler's Treaty-making Power, 187, 223;
Love v. United States, 29 Ct. of Cl. 332; Ekiu v. United

175 U. S. 677; Bank v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 589; Story's
Con. Laws, § 618.
Such is the rule in Great Britain, under Employers'
Liability Act of England, enacted in 1880, Lord .Campbell's Ac- of 1846, and the "Fatal Accidents Act," although the acts themselves are silent on this point.

If the statute meant otherwise, it should have said so
in plain words. See 6 Butterworth's Workmen's Compensation, 271; Davidson v. Hill, 70 L. J., K. B., 1901, 788;

By the laws of international reciprocity and comity
this country is bound to extend the same rights and
benefits, under our own laws, to British subjects.
This is not any new or strange doctrine. United States
v. O'Keefe, 11 Wall. 178, 183.
Under the plain reading of the state statute itself plaintiff in error can recover. Endlich, Inter. Stat., § 4.
Where the language of an act is so clear and explicit as
not to be open to construction, its construction cannot be
changed by the practice of the departments, however
long continued. United States v. Graham, 110 U. S. 219;
Thornley v: United States, 113 U. S. 310.
A statute must be held to mean what the language imports. When it is clear and imperative, reasoning ab
inconvenienti is of no avail, and there is no room for construction. The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616; United
States v. Temple, 105 U. S.97; Lake County v. Rollins, 130
U. S.662; Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, 157 U. S.1.
So universally has this come to be regarded as the
true rule of interpretation, that where the legislatures of
the individual States have passed compensation acts and
have decided that where non-resident aliens are excluded
from the benefits of the Act a provision to that effect
has been inserted. See Workmen's Compensation Act
New Jersey, 1911, ch. 95, § 12; Act of Washington, 1911,
ch. 74, § 3; New Hampshire Act, 1911, ch. 163, § 6.

Act, 1911, ch. 50, § 10, par. 5; and see-McMillan v. Spider
Lake Mill Co., 115 Wisconsin, 332; Michigan Act, 1912,
No. 3, § 7.
The New York Act, ch. 816, 1913, § 17, makes its provisions applicable to non-resident aliens.
The acts of other States appear to be silent on the
subject. Bradbury's Workmen's Compensation.

The California Act 1911, ch. 399, has been construed
by the board to include in its benefits non-resident aliens.
See Boyd's Workmen's Compensation, § 263.
In all other States, where this question has arisen, and
where the statutes are silent on the point of the relatives
who shall recover for a negligent death, it appears to have
been held in respective state courts that, by the plain
reading of the statute itself, non-resident aliens are necessarily included among those entitled to the remedies and
benefits of the statute. See Kellyville Coal Co. v. Petraytis,

The trial judge was correct in affirming the defendant's
point, to the effect that plaintiffs, being non-resident
aliens, had no right of action under the Act of Congress of
April 22, 1908, etc.
The record justified the action of the trial judge in directing the jury that "Under all the evidence the verdict
should be for the defendant," for two reasons:
The deceased employ6 assumed the risk of his employment.
The non-resident alien plaintiffs were not dependent
upon the deceased employ6 for maintenance and support.
The case may not have been properly brought before
this court by the direct writ of error.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTick McKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
Action in trespass under the Railroad Employers' Liability Act of Congress of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65,
as amended April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, brought
against the railway company, which, it is alleged, caused
by negligence the death of Peter McGovern, one of its
employ~s. Plaintiff was duly appointed administratrix
of the estate of McGovern and brought the action in behalf
of his surviving parents, who are citizens of Great Britain
and Ireland.
McGovern was not married, was twenty-four years old,
and was in the habit of making regular contributions to
the support of his parents. The facts of the killing are
not now in dispute, the principal question in the case being
whether under the act of Congress an action can be maintained for the benefit of non-resident aliens.
There were two trials of the action. At the first trial
plaintiff obtained a verdict. On motion of the 'railway
company, the court, being of opinion that the action could
not be maintained for'the benefit of non-resident aliens,
granted a new trial. 209 Fed. Rep. 975. On the second
trial the railway company submitted to the court for its
affirmance the following propositions, -among others:
(1) The parents of McGovern, being non-resident aliens,
have no right under the act of Congress for which the
action might be maintained and, therefore, a verdict should
be directed in favor of the company. (2) Under all of the
evidence in the case a verdict should be for the company.
The court affirmed the propositions and directed a verdict
for the company. The jury returned a verdict accordingly,
and judgment was duly entered for the railway company.
This writ of error was then sued out.
It is suggested rather than urged that the case is not
properly here on direct appeal. But the right of direct

398

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

appeal is based on the ground, among others, that the construction and application of the treaty between the United
States and Great Britain and Ireland are involved in the
..case, the favored-nation clause of which give the residents
and citizens of Great Britain and Ireland the same rights
as those of Italy, and that by a treaty between the latter
and the United States its citizens are entitled to exactly
the same rights as citizens of this country in the courts of
this country, although the citizens of Italy may be residing
abroad.
In its first opinion irf the case the District Court discussed at length the question arising upon the treaty and
held adversely to plaintiff. We must presume, therefore,
that the court considered the treaties as elements in its
decision upon the right of McGovern to recover for the
benefit of the parents of the deceased. This court, therefore, has jurisdiction.
We need not, however, discuss the treaties. The view
we take of the statute makes such course unnecessary.
But see Maiorano v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., infra.
Section 1 of the Act of Congress of 1908 provides that
every common carrier by railroad, while engaged in interstate commerce, "shall be liable in damages to any person
suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in
such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employ6,
to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of
the surviving widow or husband and children of, such
employ6; and, if none, then of such employ6's parents . . . " the carrier or itt agents being negligent
or its instrumentalities being defective due to its negligence. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, 233 U. S. 492,
501,
In ruling upon the statute the District Court considered
that the reasoning in Deni v. Penna. R. R., 181 Pa. St.
525, and in Maioranov. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., 213 U. S.
268, applied. In the Deni Case the Supreme Court of Penn-

Opinion of the Court.

sylvania, passing upon a statute of the State which permitted certain named relatives to recover damages for
death occurring through negligence, held that the statute
had no extra-territorial force and that plaintiff in the action was not within its purview, though its language possibly admitted of the inclusion of non-resident aliens. The
MaioranoCase came to this court on writ of error to the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, where the doctrine of
the Deni Case was repeated and applied. This ruling was
simply accepted by this court as the construction of the
state statute by the highest court of the State.
We concede some strength of persuasion to the Pennsylvania decision but to it may be opposed the ruling in
other jurisdictions. Mulhall v. Fallon, 176 Massachusetts,
266; Kellyville Coal Co. v. Petraytis, 195 Illinois, 217; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Mateo Fajardo etux., 74
Kansas, 314. In the latter case and in Mulhall v. Fallon
many other cases are reviewed, including English and
Canadian cases, and it was concluded that the weight of
authority in -thiscountry and in England was that alienage
is not a condition affecting a recovery under acts such as
that involved in the case at bar.
In Patek v. American Smelting Company, 154 Fed. Rep.
190, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
passed on a statute of Colorado which gave a right of action for wrongful death to persons standing in certain relation to one whose death was caused by the wrongful
act of another. The court, after considering the policy
of the act, as manifested in the legislation, and reviewing
the cases under other statutes of like character, said
(p. 194): "We think that the better reason, as also the
greater weight of adjudged cases, forbids that non-resident
aliens be -excluded, by interpretation, from among the
beneficiaries designated in the statute."
We may refer to these cases for their reasoning without
reproducing it, and need-not do much more than add that

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

the policy of the Employers' Liability Act accords with and
finds expression in the universality of its language. Its
purpose is something more than to give compensation for
the negligence of railroad companies. Even if that were
its only object we might accept the distinction expressed
in Mulhall v. Fallon, supra, between the duties imposed
by a statute upon persons in another State and benefits
conferred upon them. Extra-territorial application would
naturally not be given to the first, "but rights can be offered to such persons, and if, as is usually the case, the
power that governs them makes no objection, there is
nothing to hinder their accepting what is offered." Mulhall v. Fallon, supra (p. 268).
The rights and remedies of the statute are the means
of executing its policy. If this "puts burdens on our own
citizens for the benefit of non-resident aliens," as said by
the District Court, quoting the Deni Case, supra, it is a
burden imposed for wrongdoing that has caused the destruction of life. It is to the prevention of this that the
statute is directed. It is for the protection of that life
that compensation for its destruction is given and to
those who have relation to it. These may be wife, children or parents. The statute, indeed, distinguishes between them, but what difference can it make where they
may reside? It is the fact of their relation to the life destroyed that is the circumstance to be considered, whether
we consider the injuryreceived by them or the influence
of that relation upon the-life destroyed.
It is, however, contended by the railway company that
the deceased McGovern assumed the risk of his employment. This is attempted to be supported by the facts in
the case. The testimony of plaintiff tended to show the
following facts: McGovern was killed by a train bound
from New York to Philadelphia while he was engaged in
cleaning snow from the tracks of the railway company
when there were mist, smoke and occasional flurries of

McGOVERN v. PHILA. & READING R. R.

Opinion of the Court.

snow. At the place where the men were working were four
main lines of trackage. Shortly after nine o'clock'the
men were warned off what was called track No. 4 by a
call of the foreman to "look out" or "heads up," in order
to let a local train pass by.
McGovern and two others were working on track No. 2.
There was no call to them, the practice of the foreman
being to designate the track in his warning, the men on
the other track continuing to work. The foreman testified that he did not see the New York train "because it
was a bad morning, snowing, and the Norristown train
was a little bit slack, and there was steam and smoke and
snow in front of the New York train." The New York
train gave no signal and no warning was given of it. It
was testified that the watchman had got his feet wet and
had gone to change his shoes. And it was also in testimony that the Norristown train was slow and the New
York train came fast and that while the men were attracted by the first the other rushed down upon them.
There was testimony by the railway company that the
engine whistled. One witness called it a "wicked whistle,"
and there was also testimony that the men and McGovern
directly were warned that they were working in a dangerous place and to be careful.
There was testimony that the watchman was not absent and that it was his duty to notify the workmen of
approaching trains; that the company, besides, have subforemen to direct the workmen; that the men are "told
to be careful" and to watch for themselves "and depend
