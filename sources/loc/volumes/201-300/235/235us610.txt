effect of the restriction contained in § 829. This court does
nbt sit to pass upon moot questions; and, as has been often
,pointed out, it is incumbent upon one who seeks an
adjudication that a state statute is repugnant to the
Federal Constitution to show that he is within the class
with respect to whom it is unconstitutional, and that the
alleged unconstitutional feature injures him, and so
operates as to deprive him of rights protected by the
Constitution. Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 161;

HENDRICK v. STATE OF MARYLAND.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY,
STATE OF MARYLAND.
No. 77.

Argued November 11, 12, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

Only those whose rights are directly affected can properly question the
constitutionality of a state statute and invoke the jurisdiction of this
court in respect thereto.
Where a state statute provides as a prerequisite to the use of the highways of a State without cost by residents of other States compliance
with the highway laws of their respective States, one who does not
show such compliance cannot set up a claim for discrimination in this
particular.
Quere, and not now decided, whethei the Motor Vehicle Law of Maryland so discriminates against residents of the District of Columbia
as to be an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the laws in
that respect. This court will assume, in the absence of a definite
and authoritative ruling of the courts of a State to the contrary, that

HENDRICK v. MARYLAND.
235 U. S.

Counsei for Plaintiff in Error.

when a statute shall be construed by the highest court, discrimination against the residents of a particular State or Territory will be
denied.
The movement of motor vehicles over highways being attended by constant and serious dangers to the public and also being abnormally
destructive to the highways is a proper subject of police regulation
by the State.
In the absence of national legislation covering the subject, a State may
prescribe uniform regulations necessary for safety and order in respect to operation of motor vehicles on its highways including those
moving in interstate commerce.
A reasonable graduated license fee on motor vehicles when imposed on
those engaged in interstate commerce does not constitute a direct
and material burden on such commerce and render the act imposing
such fee void under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.
A State may require registration of motor vehicles; and a reasonable
license fee is not unconstitutional as denial of equal protection pf the
laws because graduated according to the horse power of the engine..
Such a classification is reasonable.
The reasonableness of the State's action is always subject to inquiry
in so far as it affects interstate commerce, and in that regard it is
likewise subordinate to the will of Congress.
A State which, at its own expense, furnishes special facilities for the
use of those engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce may exact
compensation therefor; and if the charges are reasonable and uniform
they constitute no burden on interstate commerce. The action of
the State in such respect must be treated as correct unless the contrary is made to appear.
A state motor vehicle law imposing reasonable license fees on motors,
including those of non-residents, does not interfere with rights of citizens of the United States to pass through the State. Crandall v.
Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, distinguished.

THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality of certain provisions of the Motor Vehicle
Law of Maryland and their application to citizens of
the District of Columbia, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Jackson H. Ralston and Mr. Osborne I. Yellott,
with whom Mr. Clement L. Bouve and Mr. William E.
Richardson were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

235 U. S.

The act is an illegal attempt to regulate interstate commerce.
Passing into or through States of the Union in automobiles is an act of interstate commerce.
The matter of interstate transportation of passengers
is one capable of uniform regulation and legislation, and
is thus exclusively within the domain of Congress and
wholly apart from regulation or interference on the part
of the States.
Where, in subjects requiring uniformity of legislation,
such as interstate transportation of passengers, the state
law comes into direct conflict with the commerce clause,
it is illegal, although a bona fide attempt to exercise the
police power of the State.
The exaction of license and registration fees as conditional to the privilege of the use of the roads of the State
of Maryland is an attempt to regulate interstate commerce directly, and imposes a burden on such commerce.
The Maryland law is unconstitutional, as violative
of the rights of citizens of the United States to pass into
and through Maryland.
The Motor Vehicle Law discriminates unconstitutionally
against the residents of the District of Columbia.
The Motor Vehicle Law is further unconstitutional,
in that it is not a bona fide exercise of the police power of
the State, but an unlawful attempt to collect revenue for
the State.
The law is unconstitutional in that the registration
fees provided for and graded according to differing scales
of payment have no relation to the necessary expense of
identification or control of motor vehicles, and constitutes arbitrary, unequal, unfair, and class legislation, and
does not insure to the citizens of the United States equal
protection of the laws.
The tax imposed is not laid as compensation for the
use of the roads.

The mere fact that the funds received by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles are to be turned over to the
State Treasurer for the benefit of a road fund, does not

The fact that the law operates only on motor vehicles
does not create an unreasonable classification of vehicles

Residents of the District of Columbia are classified
differently from the residents of other States except
Maryland. This classification is a reasonable one, and
rests upon a well founded ground of distinction of which
the court will take judicial notice. The court will also
take judicial notice of the fact tfiat there is no large city
in any other State so situated with respect to the borders
of Maryland. This is conclusive of the justness of the
classification. Heath v. Worst, 207 U. S. 338, 355; Patsone

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

court.
Plaintiff in error was tried before a Justice of the Peace,
Prince George's County, Maryland, upon a charge of
violating the Motor Vehicle Law. A written motion to
quash the warrant because of conflict between the statute
and the Constitution of the United States was denied; he
was found guilty and fined. Thereupon an appeal was
taken to the Circuit Court-the highest in the State
having jurisdiction-where the cause stood for trial de
novo upon the original papers. It was there submitted
for determination by the court upon an agreed statement
of facts grievously verbose but in substance as follows:
The cause was originally brought July 27, 1910, before
a Justice of the Peace for Prince George's County by the
State against John T. Hendrick for violating § 133 of the
Motor Vehicle Law effective July 1, 1910. He is and then
was a citizen of the United States, resident and commorant

IIENDRI(CK v. MARYLAND.

Opinion of the Court.

in the District of Columbia. On that day he left his office
in Washington in his own automobile and drove it into
Prince George's County and while temporarily there was
arrested' on the charge of operating it upon the highways
without having procured the certificate of registration
required by § 133 of the Motor Vehicle Law. He was
brought before a Justice of the Peace and fined fifteen-.
dollars after having .been found guilty of the charge set
out in a warrant duly issued-a motion to quash having
been denied. Whereupon he filed his appeal. At the
time and place aforesaid he had not procured the certificate
of registration for his automobile required by § 133. Upon
the foregoing the court shall determine the questions and
differences between the parties and render judgment
according as their rights in law may appear in the same
manner as if the facts aforesaid were proven upon the
trial. Either party may appeal.
The Maryland legislature, by an act effective July 1,
1910 (c. 207, Laws 1910, 168, at p. 177), prescribed a comprehensive scheme for licensing and regulating motor
vehicles. The following summary sufficiently indicates
its provisions:
The Governor shall appoint a commissioner of motor
vehicles, with power to designate assistants, who shall
secure enforcement of the statute. Before any motor
vehicle is operated upon the highways the owner shall
make a statement to the commissioner and procure a
certificate of registration; thereafter it shall bear a numbered plate. This certificate and plate shall be evidence
of authority for operating the machine during the current
year (§ 133). Registration fees are fixed according to
horse-power-six dollars when 20 or less; twelve dollars
when from 20 to 40; and eighteen dollars when in excess
of 40 (§ 136). No person shall drive a motor vehicle upon
the highway until he has obtained at a cost of two dollars
an operator's license, subject to revocation for cause

(§ 137). Any owner or operator of an automobile, nonresident of Maryland, who has complied with the laws of
the State in which he resides requiring the registration
of motor vehicles, or licensing of operators thereof, etc.,
may under specified conditions obtain a distinguishing
tag and permission to operate such machine over the
highways for not exceeding two periods of seven consecutive days in a calendar year without paying the ordinary
fees for registration and operator's license (§ 140a); but
residents of the District of Columbia are' not included
amongst those to whom this privilege is granted (§ 132).
Other secfions relate to speed, rules of the road, accidents, signals, penalties, arrests, trials, fines, etc. All
money collected under the provisions of the Act go to the
commissioner, and except so much as is necessary for
salaries and expenses must be paid into the state treasury
to be used in construction, maintaining, and repairing
the streets of Baltimore and roads built or aided by a
county or the State itself. Section 140a is copied in the
margin.1
"140a. Any owner or operator not a resident of this State who shall
have complied with the laws of the State in which he resides, requiring

the registration of motor vehicles or licensing of operators thereof and
the display of identification or registration numbers on such vehicles,
and who shall cause the identification numbers of such State, in accordance with the laws thereof, and none other, together with the initial
letter of said State, to be displayed on his motor vehicle, as in this
subtitle provided, while used or operated upon the public highways of
this State, may use such highways not exceeding two periods of seven
consecutive days in each calendar year, without complying with the
provisions of Sections 133 and 137 of this subtitle; if he obtains from
the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and displays on the rear of such
vehicle a tag or marker which the said Commissioner of Motor Vehicles
shall issue in such form and contain such distinguishing marks as he may
deem best; provided, that if any non-resident be convicted of violating
any provisions of Sections 140b, 140c, 140d, 140e and 1401 of this subtitle, he shall thereafter be subject to and required to comply with all
the provisions of said Sections 133 and 137 relating to the registration of

HENDRICK v. MARYLAND.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff in error maintains that the act is void because
-It discri'minates against residents of the District of
Columbia; attempts to regulate interstate commerce;
violates the rights of citizens of the United States to pass
into and through the State; exact6 a tax for revenue-not
mere compensation, for the use of facilities---7according
to arbitrary classifications, and thereby deprives citizens
of the United States of the equal protection of the laws.
If the statute is otherwise valid, the alleged discrimination against residents of the District of Columbia is not
adequate ground for us now to declare it altogether bad.
At most they are entitled to equality of treatment, and
in the absence of some definite and authoritative ruling
by the courts of the State we will not assume that upon
a proper showing this will be denied. The record fails
'to disclose that Hendrick had complied with the laws
in force within the District of Columbia in respect of
registering motor vehicles and licensing operators, or 'that
he applied to the Maryland commissioner for an identifying tag or marker-prerequisites to a limited use of
the highways without cost by residents of other States
under the plain terms of § 140a. He cannot therefore set
up a claim of discrimination in this particular. Only
those whose rights are directly affected can properly question the constitutionality of a state statute and invoke
our jurisdiction in respect thereto. Hatch v. Reardon,
204 U. S. 152, 161; Williams v. Walsh, 222 U. S.415,

motor vehicles and the licensing of operators thereof; and the Governor
of this State is hereby authorized and empowered to confer and advise
with the proper officers and legislative bodies of other States of the
Union and enter into reciprocal agreements under which the registration of motor vehicles owned by residents of this State will be recognized by such other States, and he is further authorized and empowered,
from time to time, to grant to residents of other States the privilege
of using the roads of this State as in this section provided in return for
similar privileges granted residents of this State by such other States."

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

Kansas & Texas Ry. v. Cade, 233 U. S. 642, 648, and
cases cited.
The movement of motor vehicles bver the highways is
attended by constant and serious dangers to the public,
and is also abnormally destructive to the ways themselves.
Their success depends on good roads the construction and
maintenance of which are exceedingly expensive; and in
recent years insistent demands have been made upon the
States for better facilities, especially by the ever-increasing
number of those who own such vehicles. As is well known,
in order to meet this demand and accommodate the growing traffic the State of Maryland has built and is maintaining a system of improved roadways. Primarily. for
the enforcement of good order and the protection of those
within its own jurisdiction the State put into effect the
above-described general regulations, including requirements for registration and licenses. A further evident
purpose was to secure some compensation for the use of
facilities provided at great cost from the class for whose
needs they are essential and whose operations over them
are peculiarly injurious.
In the absence of national legislation covering the subject a State may rightfully prescribe uniform regulations
necessary for public safety and order in respect to the
operation upon its highways of all motor vehicles-those
moving in interstate commerce as well as others. And
to this end it may require the registration of such vehicles
and the licensing of their drivers, charging therefor reasonable fees graduated according to the horse-power of
-the engines-a practical measure of size, speed, and difficulty of control. This is but, an exercise of the police
power uniformly recognized as belonging to the States
and essential to the preservation of the health, safety
and comfort of their citizens; and it does not constitute a
direct and material burden on interstate commerce. The
reasonableness of the State's action is always subject to

inquiry in so far as it affects interstate commerce, and in
that regard it is likewise subordinate to the will of Congress. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.- S. 27, 30, 31; Smith v.

In Smith v. Alabama, supra, consideration was given
to the validity of an Alabama statute forbidding any engineer to operate a railroad train without first undergoing
an examination touching his fitness and obtaining a license
for which a fee was charged. The language of the court,
speaking through Mr. Justice Matthews, in reply to the
suggestion that the statute unduly burdened interstate
commerce and was therefore void, aptly declares the doctrine which is applicable here. He said (p. 480):
"But the provisions on the subject contained in the
statute of Alabama under consideration are not regulations of interstate commerce. It is a misnomer to call
them such. Considered in themselves, they are parts of
that body of the local law which, as we have already seen,
properly governs the relation between carriers of passengers and merchandise and the public who employ them,
which are not displaced until they come in conflict 'with
express enactments of Congress in the exercise of its
power over commerce, and which, until so displaced,
according to the evident- intention of Congress, remain
as the law governing carriers in the discharge of their
obligations, whether engaged in the purely internal commerce of the State or in commerce among the States."
The prescribed regulations upon their face do not
appear to be either unnecessary or unreasonable.
In view of the many decisions of this court there can be

no serious doubt that where a State at its own expense
furnishds special facilities for the use of those engaged in
commerce, interstate as well as domestic, it may exact
compensation therefor. The amount of the charges and
the method of collection are primarily for determination
by the State itself; and so long as they are reasonable and
are fixed according to some uniform, fair and practical
standard they constitute no burden on interstate corn-,

Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 329, 330;
Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 405; and authorities
cited. The action of the State must be treated as correct
unless the contrary is made to appear. In the instant case
there is no evidence concerning the value of the facilities
supplied by the State, the cost of maintaining them, or
the fairness of the methods adopted for collecting the
charges imposed; and we cannot say from a mere inspection of the statute that its provisions are arbitrary or
unreasonable.
There is no solid foundation for the claim that the statute directly interferes with the rights of citizens of the
United States to pass through the State, and is consequently bad according to the doctrine announced in
Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. In that case a direct tax
was laid upon the passenger for the privilege of leaving
the State; while here the statute at most attempts to
regulate the operation of dangerous machines on the
highways and to charge for the use of valuable facilities.
As the capacity of the machine owned by plaintiff in
error does not appear, he cannot complain of discrimination because fees are imposed according to engine power.
Distinctions amongst motor machines and between them
and other vehicles may be proper-essential indeed-and
those now challenged are not obviously arbitrary or
oppressive. The statute is not a mere revenue measure

HOLBROOK.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 516. Argued December 1, 2, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.
Under the Employers' Liability Act, where death is instantaneous the
beneficiaries can recover their pecuniary loss and nothing more; but
the relationship between them and the deceased is a proper circumstance for consideration in computing the same. In every instance,
however, the award must be based on money values, the amount of
which can be ascertained only upon a view of the peculiar facts presented.
While it is proper for the trial court to instruct the jury to take into
consideration the care, attention, instruction, guidance and advice
which a father may give his children and to include the pecuniary
value thereof in the damages assessed, it is not proper to give the
jury occasion for indefinite speculation by comparing the rights of
the actual beneficiaries with those of the supposed dependents who
are mere next of kin.
Where the facts are adequate to constitute a strong appeal to the
sympathy of the jury the charge should be free from anything which
the jury can construe into a permission to go outside of the evidence.
It is the duty of the court in its relation to the jury to protect the parties
from unjust verdicts arising from impulse, passion or prejudice or
any other violation of lawful rights. Pleasantsv. Fant, 22 Wall. 116.
