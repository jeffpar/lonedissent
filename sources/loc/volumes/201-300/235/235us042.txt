TAYLOR v. PARKER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
No. 58.

Submitted November 5, 1914.-Decided November 16, 1914.

In view of the evils sought to be prevented, and in aid of the expressed
policy of the Indians and the United States, the prohibition on
alienation by allottees under the Choctaw and Chickasaw agreement ratified by the act of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641, should
be construed as extending to devise by will.
While the act of April 28, 1904, putting in force the laws of Arkansas
in the Indian Territory, enabled an Indian to dispose of his alienable property, it did not operate to remove existing statutory restrictions.
That it was the understanding of Congress that an act did not remove
restrictions may be indicated by subsequent acts passed for the
express purpose of removing such restrictions.
33 Oklahoma, 199, affirmed.
THE

facts, which involve the application and construc-

tion of Acts of Congress imposing and affecting restrictions on alienation of lands allotted under the Choctaw
and Chickasaw agreement ratified July 1, 1902, are
stated in the opinion.
Mr. H. A. Ledbetter for plaintiff in error.

Mr. Cornelius Hardy, Mr. A. C. Cruce, Mr. W. I. Cruce
and Mr. W. R. Bleakmore for defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit by the heirs of Maggie Taylor, a member

of the Chickasaw tribe of Indians, against the plaintiff in
error, her husband and devisee, to recover her allotment,
which she devised to him. The answer relied upon the

will, the plaintiffs demurred, and the courts of Oklahoma
sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. 33 Oklahoma, 199. The question is whether the
devise was invalid under the supplemental agreement
with the Choctaws and Chickasaws ratified by the Act
of Congress of July 1, 1902, c. 1362. 32 Stat. 641.
By § 12 of the above act "each member of said tribes
shall, at the time of the selection of his allotment, designate as a homestead out of said allotment land equal in
value to one hundred and sixty acres of the average
allotable land of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations,
as nearly as may be, which shall be inalienable during
the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one
years from the date of certificate of allotment, and separate certificate and patent shall issue for said homestead."
By § 16 all lands allotted to members of said tribes except
homestead shall be alienable after issue of patent, one
fourth in acreage in one year, one fourth in three years,
and the rest in five years; but not for less than its appraised
value before the expiration of the tribal governments.
The plaintiff in error, in aid of the construction of §§ 12, 16,
for which he contends, and to show that transactions
inter vivos alone were aimed at by the word "inalienable,"
invokes § 15 which enacts that allotted lands "shall not be
affected or encumbered by any deed, debt, or obligation
of any character contracted prior to the time at which
said land may be alienated under this Act, nor shall said
lands be sold except as herein provided."
The land in question was .allotted to Maggie Taylor in
1903, including, it would seem, a homestead; patents were
issued on December 20, 1904, and were approved by the
Secretary of the Interior and delivered on December 28,
1904. She made her will on March 22, and died on
March 25,1905, so that if the foregoing prohibitions extend
to a devise they include the one under which the plaintiff in
error claims. Obviously they could be read in a narrower

sense, and whichever interpretation be adopted it would
not be helped by long discussion. In view of the evils
sought to be prevented and in aid of what we understand
to have been the policy of the Indians and the United
States in their agreement, we are of opinion that the
Supreme Court of this State was right in extending the
prohibition to wills. To the same effect is Hayes v. Barringer, 93 C. C. A. 507; 168 Fed. Rep. 221. See also
Jackson v. Thompson, 38 Washington, 282.
A further and distinct argument is based upon the act
to provide for additional judges, etc., of April 28, 1904,
c. 1824, § 2, 33 Stat. 573, to the effect that all the laws of
Arkansas theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory
are extended to embrace all persons and estates in said
territory, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise, and
full jurisdiction is conferred upon the district courts in
the settlement of all estates of decedents, and the guardianship of minors and incompetents, whether Indians,
freedmen, or otherwise. The Arkansas law of wills was
a part of the law that thus had been, adopted for the
Indian Territory before 1904, and it is contended that the
result of the above extension was to free the Indians from
the restrictions so specifically imposed upon them in 1902.
Of course nothing of that sort was intended. As said below (33 Oklahoma, p. 201), the extension enabled "the Indian to devise all his alienable property by will made in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas, but did
not operate to remove any of the restrictions theretofore
placed upon lands of Indians by act of Congress," That
this was the understanding of Congress is indicated by the
acts of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, § 23, 34 Stat. 137, 145, and
May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, giving Indians power to
dispose of their allotments by will.
Judgment affirmed.
