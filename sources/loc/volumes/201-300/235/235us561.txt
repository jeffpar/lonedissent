GILBERT v. DAVID.
235 U. S.

Syllabus.

We are of the opinion that commerce thus carried on is
not interstate commerce, beyond the taxing power of the
State, and that the return on which the tax was assessed
did not involve the revenues of commerce among the
States, and this -contention must be rejected.
It follows that the decision of the Supreme Court of
New York must be
Affirmed.

v.

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT.
No. 97.

Argued December 4, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

As § 37, Judicial Code, does not prescribe any particular mode by which
the question of jurisdiction shall be raised, the method of raising that
question may be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge; and,
if the state practice admits, the issue may be raised by general denial
in the answer.
While the trial court may submit the question of a party's residence to
the jury, it is not bound to do so; and in this case the court properly
exercised its privilege to dispose of that issue on the testimony.
In this case the defendant was not chargeable with laches because he
did not force to trial the issue of plaintiff's citizenship.
The fact that delay in determining the issue of citizenship results in the
statute of limitations applying, does not confer jurisdiction on the
Federal court if diverse citizenship does not exist.
Where the record in a case dismissed by th6 District Court for want of
jurisdiction on account of absence of diverse citizenship brings up
the testimony, this court must consider it and determine whether
the trial court rightly decided that plaintiff was a citizen of the same
State as defendant.

Change of domicile arises where there is a change of abode and the

THE

Mr. Howard W. Taylor for plaintiff in error:
Under the, pleadings as they stood the court was without power to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction due
to lack of diversity of citizenship, and the order or judgment of dismissal was a nullity.
Under the facts proven, the court erred in holding that
the evidence showed the plaintiff to be a citizen of Connecticut.
The laches of the defendants in failing to raise the
question of jurisdiction until after a period of three years
had elapsed from the accrual of the cause of action and for
over two years after the filing of the substituted complaint required the trial court, in the exercise of the proper
discretion, to refuse to consider the question of jurisdiction after the lapse of so many years.
An analysis of the evidence shows that the court in
its deductions therefrom applied a wrong principle of
law in 'the consideration of the evidence and failed to
apply the correct principle.
The judgment should be reversed and the trial court

Mr. Frederick H. Wiggin and Mr. A. T. Bateg for defendants in error:
The plaintiff was domiciled in and was a citizen of Connecticut when the action was brought, and was not a citizen of Michigan.
It was not error to render judgment upon the pleadings
as they stood.
The 'court did not err in ruling that the claimed running
of the statute of limitations could not save this action,
notwithstanding defendant's alleged failure to introduce
evidence of plaintiff's citizenship until after the limitation
period had expired.
The court committed no error in taking the question of
jurisdiction from the jury.
The, court committed no error in refusing to hear argument upon the question of jurisdiction.
The trial court did not err in admitting in evidence and
considering the tax 'lists.

MR. JusTIcE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is here upon writ of error and certificate presenting the question of jurisdiction of the District Court.
It comes under § 238 of the Judicial Code, and presents to
this court the question of jurisdiction only. The suit was
begun on November 5, 1904, in the United States Circuit
Court for the District of Connecticut. On May 24, 1905, a
substituted complaint was filed. The object of. the suit
was to recover for alleged breaches of a certain indemnity
contract set forth in the complaint. In this substituted
complaint, as well as in the original complaint, the allegation as to diverse citizenship is that plaintiff is a citizen of
the State of Michigan, and defendants are citizens of the
State of Connecticut. On August 3, 1907, an answer was

235 U. S.

filed, in which it was admitted that the defendants were
citizens of the State of Connecticut, and it was averred
that the defendants had no knowledge or information as
to the citizenship of the plaintiff, and would "leave him to
proof thereof." On April 27, 1911, the defendants filed a
motion to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction. On
October 5, 1911, defendants filed another motion to dismiss
for want of jurisdiction. On October 6, 1911, the plaintiff
filed a motion to strike the last-mentioned motion from
the files. Both of the motions to dismiss were upon the
ground that the plaintiff was not a citizen of the State of
Michigan but was a citizen of the State of Connecticut.
The motion of the plaintiff to strike the last-mentioned
motion from the files was upon the ground, among others,
that the motion was an improper and irregular method of
raising the question of jurisdiction and because that matter
was already in issue under the allegations of complaint and
answer.
After the taking effect of the Judicial Code on January 1, 1912, the case was transferred to the District
Court of the United States for the District of Connecticut.
On August 26, 1912, a jury was impanelled, and the case
came on for trial. The court directed that the trial should
proceed upon the question of jurisdiction. Thereupon the
parties proceeded to offer testimony upon the question of
plaintiff's residence. At the conclusion of this testimony,
the court found that the plaintiff and defendants were
citizens of the State of Connecticut at the time the action
was begun, and accordingly dismissed the suit upon the
sole ground of want of jurisdiction, and ordered the jury
discharged from further consideration of the case.
The act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, 472, § 5,
now § 37 of the Judicial Code, provides:
"If in any suit commenced in a district court, or removed from a state court to a district court of the United
States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said dis-

GILBERT v. DAVID.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

trict court, at any time after such suit has been brought
or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and
substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly
within the jurisdiction of said district court, or that the
parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively
made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the
purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under
this chapter, the said district court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the
court from which it was removed, as justice may require,
and shall make such order as to costs as shall be just."
This section defines the duty of the District Court of
the United States when it shall appear to its satisfaction
that the suit does not really and substantially involve a
dispute or controversy properly within the court's jurisdiction. While this section gives the court the right to
dismiss a suit when that situation appears, whether the
parties raise the question or not, it is the duty of the defendant to bring the matter to the attention of the court,
in some proper way, where the facts are known upon
which a want of jurisdiction appears. Deputron v. Young,
134 U. S. 241, 251. Under the former practice, before the
passage of the act of 1875, above quoted, it was necessary
to raise the issue of citizenship by a plea in abatement,
when the pleadings properly averred the citizenship of the
parties. Fdrmingtonv. Pillsbury, 114 U. S. 138, 143; Little
v. Giles, 118 U. S. 596, 604. The objection may be made
now by answer before answering to the merits, or it may
be made by motion. Steigleder v. McQuestion, 198 U. S.
141. The statute does not prescribe any particular mode
by which the question of jurisdiction is to be brought to
the attention of the court, and the method of raising the
question may be left to the sound discretion of the trial
judge. Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U. S. 115, 121. It may be
raised by a general denial in the answer, where the state
practice permits of that course. Roberts v. Lewis, 144"

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

U. S. 653. In the State of Connecticut, under the form of
denial contained in this answer, the answer raised the
issue. Sayles v. FitzGerald, 72 Connecticut, 391, 396.
Moreover, the parties to the suit regarded the matter
as at issue under the pleadings, and it was so held by the
court. The motion of the plaintiff to strike off the motion
to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was based upon the
ground that that issue was already made in the pleadings.
The question was properly before the court.
It is also insisted that the court erred in itself considering the testimony and in not submitting the issue to the
jury. But while the court might have submitted the question to the jury, it was not bound to do so, the parties
having adduced their testimony, pro and con, it was the
privilege of the court, if it saw fit, to dispose of the issue
upon the testimony which was fully heard upon that subject. Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U. S. 115, supra.
It is urged that the delay in making the issue and bringing it to a hearing was such laches upon the part of the
defendants 'as to preclude the consideration of the question. The issue was made when the answer was filed, but
for some reason neither party forced the case to trial.
Apart from the imperative duty of the court to dismiss the
action under the statute, when it appears that the case is
not within the jurisdiction of the court, we find nothing
in the conduct of the parties to support the suggestion of
laches. If it be true that the statute of limitations would
prevent the beginning of a new action in the, state court,
that fact cannot confer jurisdiction upon a court of the
United States in the absence of a showing of diverse citizenship.
As the record brings up the testimony upon which the
court below decided the question, it becomes the duty of
this court to consider it and determine whether the court
rightly found that the plaintiff at the beginning of the
"suit was not a citizen of the State of Michigan. Wetmore

v. Rymer, 169 U. S. 115, supra. If the plaintiff was
domiciled in the State of Michigan when this suit was
begun, he was a citizen of that State within the meaning
of the Judicial Code. Morris v. Gilmer, 129 U. S. 315.
Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U. S. 619, 624. In this case it
clearly appears that for some years prior to 1890 the
plaintiff lived in Menominee, in the State of Michigan.
He had there a home, and exercised the ordinary duties
and privileges of citizenship. In February, 1890, his
uncle died in Connecticut, and the plaintiff immediately
went to Danbury, in that State, where he remained practically all the time until his death in 1911.
The question is, Had he lost his domicile in Michigan
and acquired one in Connecticut, so that he was at the
beginning of the suit in 1904 in reality a citizen of the
last-mentioned. State?
This matter of domicile has been often before this court,
and was last under consideration in the case of Williamson
v. Osenton, 232 U. S. 619, supra. In that case the definition of domicile, as defined by Mr. Dicey, in his book on
"Conflict of Laws," 2d ed., 111, is cited with approval.
There change of domicile is said to arise where there is a
change of abode and" the absence of any present intention
to not reside permanently or indefinitely in the new abode."
Or, as Judge Story puts it in his work on "Conflict of
Laws," 7th Ed., § 46, page 41, "If a person has actually
removed to another place, with an intention of remaining
there for an indefinite time, and as a place of fixed present
domicile, it is to be deemed his place of domicile, notwithstanding he may entertain a floating intention to
return at some future period." "The requisite animus
is the present intention of permanent or indefinite residence
in a given place or country, or, negatively expressed, the
absence of any present intention of not residing there
permanently or indefinitely." Price v. Price, 156 Pa. St.
617, 626.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

Applying these definitions to the conduct of plaintiff,
we have no doubt that the court was right in holding
that he had acquired a new domicile in the State of Connecticut. He removed there with his family, and occupied
a house to which he held the title. He owned other real
estate in Connecticut, inherited from his uncle. He took
a letter from his church in Michigan to a church in Danbury, Connecticut. For about ten years he was not back
in Michigan, except for a short time, and then for a temporary purpose. The Michigan homestead and much of
the furniture used there were sold upon the removal to
Connecticut. For more than ten years he resided continuously with his family in the same house in Danbury,
Connecticut. While the plaintiff did not vote in Connecticut, as far as the record shows, it is in evidence that he
declared to another his intention of becoming a voter
there. To some witnesses he declared his purpose to
reside in Connecticut. As against this testimony, it
appears that he left his desk with his brother-in-law in
Michigan, which he declared was for the purpose of
"holding his residence there." To some witnesses he declared his intention to live in Michigan and expressed his
preference for that State as a dwelling-place. He continued to pay membership dues to orders to which he belonged in Michigan.
It is apparent from all the testimony that the plaintiff
may have had, and probably did have, some floating intention of returning to Michigan after the determination of certain litigation and the disposition of his property
in Connecticut should he succeed in disposing of it for
what he considered it worth. But as we have seen, a
floating intention of that kind was not enough to prevent
the new place, under the circumstances shown, from
becoming his domicile. It was his place of abode which he
had no present intention of changing, that is the essence
of domicile.

JEFFREY MANUFACTURING COMPANY v.
BLAGG.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.
No. 511.

Argued December 1, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

The negligence of a fellow servant is more likely to be a cause of injury
in larger establishments than in smaller ones and assumption of risk
is different in the former than in the latter. Classifications based
on number of employ6s in a state statute abolishing the fellow servant and assumption of risk defenses under specified conditions are
not so arbitrary as to amount to a denial of equal protection of the
laws.
This court only hears objections to the constitutionality of a statute
from -nose who are themselves affected by its alleged unconstitutionality in the feature complained of. Where the employer raises
the question of denial of equal protection of the laws, arguments
based on alleged discriminations against employ6s cannot be decisive.
The Fourteenth Amendment only takes from the State the right and
power to classify subjects of legislation when the attempted classification is so arbitrary and unreasonable that the court can declare
it beyond legislative authority. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas
Co., 220 U. S.61.
In a general Workmen's Compensation Act, establishing a state plan
that all employers having five or more employ6s may enter on equal
terms, a provision, abolishing the defense of contributory negligence
as to such employers who do not come into the plan, is not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the laws as to
them because the defense is not abolished as to those having
less than five employ6s; the classification is not arbitrary and unreasonable, and so held as to such provision in the Workmen's Compensation Law of Ohio.

due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
