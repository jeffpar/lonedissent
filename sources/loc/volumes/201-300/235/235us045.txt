WILLOUGHBY v. CITY OF CHICAGO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 66.

Motion to dismiss submitted November 6, 1914.-Decided
November 16, 1914.

Where the constitutional question is obvious from the beginning and
is not open in the Supreme Court of the State unless taken on the
trial, it cannot be considered here ulless it was so taken. Hulbert
v. Chicago, 202 U. S. 275.
Where an assessment could have been levied for a past improvement
against the original owners, purchasers take subject to the same
liability, and such an assessment does not deprive them of their property without due process of law. Seattle v. Kelleher., 195 U. S. 351.
Whether a particular assessment could have been levied for past improvements if the property had not been sold depends upon the
construction of state statutes, as to which this court follows the
decisions of the state courts.
The overruling of its earlier decisions by the state court does not
amount to deprivation of property without due process of law where
no vested rights are interfered with. Muhlker v. Harlem R. R. Co.,
197 U. S. 544, distinguished.
On writ of error based on the claim that there was no power to make
the assessment, this court cannot inquire into the facts as found by
the state court in regard to value of the land taken for, and the extent of the benefit conferred by, the improvement for which the
land has been assessed.

Mr. Charles R. Holden for plaintiffs in error in opposition to the motion:
Special assessments are statutory proceedings, and
without a statutory warrant no special assessment can
be levied, and this applies to new or supplemental assessments. Chicago v. Race, 256 Illinois, 209.
The special assessment in question, a supplemental one,
is without any statutory warrant. Section 53, under which
the proceeding was had, did not expressly provide for any
supplemental assessment.
A new or supplemental assessment, even if originally
warranted under said § 53, which is at least a doubtful
question, was barred in five years after July 2, 1908, under
the plainly worded statute-so plain as to scarcely bear
construction.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

If this be considered as a new or reassessment under
§ 46, the same could not be levied after the confirmation
judgment of July 2, 1898. McChesney v. Chicago, 161
Illinois, 110; People v. McWethy, 165 Illinois, 222; LeMoyne v. Chicago, 175 Illinois, 356; Rich v. Chicago, 187
Illinois, 396; City v. Nichols, 192 Illinois, 489; Doremus v.
Chicago, 212 Illinois, 513; Holden v. Chicago, 212 Illinois,
289; Chicago v. Hulbert, 205 Illinois, 346, 357; Chicago v.
Nodeck, 202 Illinois, 257, 266; Noonan v. Chicago, 231
Illinois, 588; Chicago v. Race, 256 Illinois, 209.
These owners had purchased upon the faith of this
long line of uniform and settled rulings of the Supreme
Court of Illinois. And hence the judgment here, based
upon a square reversal of these rulings is a taking without
due process of law. Muhlker v. Harlem R. R., 197 U. S.
544; Great South. Hotel Co. v. Jones, 193 U. S. 532.
The judgment upon its face is pure confiscation of
property. The property of plaintiffs in error is taken
upon the ground that it is a public necessity, and then
they are assessed over $300 more than the awards for
the property taken from them.
This is in its essence a taking without due process.
City of Bloomington v. Latham, 142 Illinois, 462; Norwood
v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

In 1893 a portion of certain land now belonging to the
plaintiffs in error Was taken by Chicago for the widening
of a street, and the damages to the owners were fixed by
judgment in due form. Afterwards an assessment for
betterments by reason of the change was laid upon certain
lands in this neighborhood including the lots in question
and was confirmed as to the other land. At the trial
with regard to these lots it was contended by the owner
and ruled in the lower court that the matter was concluded

WILLOUGHBY v. CHICAGO.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

by the first judgment. This ruling was reversed by the
Supreme Court of the State, Chicago v. Mecartney, 216
Illinois, 377, but by the failure of the City to file the remanding order within two years the assessment upon these
lots failed. In January, 1910, the City passed an ordinance
for a new assessment, the object of which was to reach
these lots, and ,a new petition was filed. The Supreme
Court of the State held that the validity of the assessment
did not depend on the validity of the ordinance; that the
petition was warranted by the former proceedings, and
that a judgment for the amount should be affirmed.
249 Illinois, 249.
The error assigned is that the property of the plaintiffs
in error is taken without due process of law and that the
obligation of their contracts is impaired (they having
purchased before this supplementary proceeding was
begun), contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and
Art. I, § 10 of the Constitution of the United States.
There is a motion to dismiss upon which we must dispose
of the case. The objection which is urged is that there
was no statutory authority for this proceeding and that
the assessment was imposed by mere judicial fiat that
could not have been anticipated and that was without
warrant of law. If there were anything in this objection
it was obvious from the beginning and as it was not taken
at the trial it was not open in the Supreme Court of the
State and could not be considered here. Hulbert v.
Chicago, 202 U. S. 275. It is obvious too that the State
could have authorized the proceeding followed here,
which ordinarily is the only question to be considered by
this court. Missouri v. Dockery, 191 U. S. 165.
If the assessment could have been levied against the
original owners of the land, purchasers took subject to
the same liability. Seattle v. Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351. The
question whether it could have been levied if the land had
not been sold depended upon the construction of state

statutes, as to which, we follow the decision of the state
court. Even if the court had overruled earlier decisions
it would have interfered with no vested rights of the
plaintiffs in error. Knox v. Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379,
383. Sauer v. New York, 206 U. S. 536. Moore-Mansfield
Construction Co. v. Electrical Installation Co., 234 U. S.
619, 626. But it does not appear to have done so, and
although its decision may have been unexpected, there was
plausible ground for it in the statutes. We go no further,
because there is no question before us of the kind that was
before the court in Muhlker v. New York & Harlem R. R.
Co., 197 U. S. 544, and Tampa Water Works Co. v. Tampa,
199 U. S. 241, 243, and in circumstances like these it is not
within our province to inquire whether the construction
was right. It is objected that less was allowed for the
land taken than was charged for the benefit, but it is
quite possible that the benefit was greater than the loss,
and we cannot inquire into the fact.
Writ of error dismissed.

In order to bring a case to this court under § 237, Judicial Code, the
Federal right must have been set up and adjudicated against the
claimant by the judgment of the state court; nor can the contention
made and passed upon by the state court be enlarged by assignmeats of error to bring the case to this court.
