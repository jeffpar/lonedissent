McCABE v. ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE
RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 15.

Argued October 26, 1914.-Decided November 30, 1914.

Under the Enabling Act the State of Oklahoma was admitted to the
Union on an equal footing with the original States, and has the same
authority to enact public legislation not in conflict with the Federal
Constitution as other States may enact. Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221
U. S. 559.
It is not an infraction of the Fourteenth Amendment for a State to
require separate, but equal, accommodations for the white and
African races. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537.
While a state statute, although fair on its face, may be so unequally and
oppressively administered by the public authorities as to amount to
an unconstitutional discrimination by the State itself, Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, no discriminations unauthorized by the
statute appear to have been practiced in this case under state authority.
The Oklahoma statute, requiring separate, but equal, accommodations
for the white and African races, must, in the absence of a different
construction by the state court, be construed as applying exclusively to intrastate commerce; and, as so construed, it does not contravene the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.
The essence of the constitutional right to equal protection of the law
is that it is a personal one and does not depend upon the number of
persons affected; and any individual who is denied by a common carrier, under authority of the State, a facility or convenience which is
furnished to another under substantially the same circumstances may
properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded.
The Oklahoma Separate Coach Law does discriminate against persons
of the African race in permitting carriers to provide sleeping cars,
dining cars and chair cars to be used exclusively by persons of the
white race; this provision none the less offends against the- Fourteenth Amendment even if there is a limited demand for such accommodations by the African race as compared with the white race.
In order to justify the granting of an injunction complainants must

show a personal need of it, and absence of adequate remedy at law.
The fact that someone else, although of the same class as complainant, may be injured does not justify granting the remedy.
In an action, brought in 'the Federal court by several persons of the
African race before the Separate Coach Law of Oklahoma went into
effect, to enjoin the enforcement thereof on the ground that it contravened the Fourteenth. Amendment, held that the allegations in the.
bill were too vague and indefinite to warrant the relief sought by
complainants; that none of -the complainants had persoially been
refused accommodations equal to those afforded to others or had
been notified that he would be so refused when the act went into effect; that it did not appear that in such event he would not have an
adequate remedy at law, and that the action could not be maintained.
186 Fed. Rep. 966, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
Separate Coach Law of Oklahoma, are stated in the
opinion.
Mr. William Harrison, with whom Mr. Edwin 0.
Tyler and Mr. Ethelbert T. Barbour were on the brief, for
appellants:
The court erred in holding that th e Oklahoma statute
does not. operate and deprive those of African descent of
the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the
Constitution, which implies not merely equal accessibility
to the court for the prevention or redress of wrongs and
the enforcement of rights, but equal exemption with
others in like condition from charges and liabilities of
every kind.
The police power cannot be interposed to support a
statute having no possible tendency to protect the, community or for the preservation of the public safety, but
which arbitrarily deprives the owner of liberty or property. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 661; Lawton v.
Steele, 152 U. S. 133; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366, 398;

Argument for Appellants.

State police legislation may be invalid because it
trenches on the sphere of the National Government under
the Federal Constitution. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe
Co., 184 U. S. 540.
So also as to police legislation which purports to deal
with subjects beyond territorial jurisdiction. Morgan's
Steamship Co. v. Louisiana, 118 U. S. 455, 464; Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania,171 U. S. 1; Missouri &c. Ry. Co. v.
Haber, 169 U. S. 618; Reid v. Colorado, 187 U, S. 137;
New York &c. R. Co. v. New York, 165 U. S. 628; Allgeyer v. Louisiana,165 U. S. 578.
A law not enacted in good faith for the promotion of the
public good but passed from the sinister motive of annoying or oppressing a particular person or class is invalid.
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356.
The Oklahoma, Act is violative of the commerce clause
of the Constitution. Henderson v. New York, 92 U. S.
259; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; Wabash &c. Ry.
Co. v. Illinois, 118 U. S. 557.
The act does restrict and affect interstate, to the same
extent as intrastate, commerce; and in this respect the act
is so plain and unambiguous as to leave no room for
interpretation. Houghton v. Payne, 194 U. S. 88.
The doctrine of contemporaneous practical construction
does not apply to statutes which are explicit and free from
any ambiguity. Swift v. United States, 105 U. S. 695;
United States v. Graham, 110 U. S. 219; Merrit v. Cameron,
137 U. S. 542, aff'g 102 Fed. Rep. 947; Franklin Sugar
Co. v. United States, 153 Fed. Rep. 653.
The term negro as used in the act includes every person
of African descent as defined by the Constitution.
Passengers coming into Oklahoma, and going out and
going through Oklahoma, upon their failure to go to the
coach or compartment designated for the race to which
they belong have been ejected, arrested and confined in
the common jails.

Commerce among the commonwealths is traffic, transportation and intercourse between two points situated in
different States. Wabash R. R. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U. S.
557; Louisville Ry. Co. v. Mississippi, 133 U. S. 587, 592;
Ches. & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, 179 U. S. 388, 395;
Butler Bros. Shoe Co. v. United States Rubber Co., 156
Fed. Rep. 1, 19. Pacific Express Co. v. Siebert, 142 U. S.
339, distinguished.
The statute is not separable as to interstate and intrastate commerce, and, therefore, the whole act is unconstitutional. United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214; Trade
Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82; Poindexterv. Greenhow, 114 U. S.
270; Pollock v. Farmers Trust Co., 158 U. S. 636. See also

118 U. S. 90, 94; Chi., Mil. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Westby, 178
Fed. Rep. 619, 632.
The very fact, that the act subjects every passenger to
the provisions of the law and makes no distinction or
exception as to interstate passengers, raises a conclusive
legal presumption that the legislature intended to make
no distinctions and exceptions, and the act is not subject
to judicial construction. To so do would be unjustifiable
judicial legislation. The rule is that which is not denied
is granted. Hall v. DeCuir, 95 U. S. 485; Union Central
Ins. Co. v. Champlin, 116 Fed. Rep. 858, 860; Wrightman

The statute is so formed and applied that its application
and operation can be used to discriminate against one
class of citizens. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356;

U. S. 339; Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S.370, 374; Soon Hing
v. Crowley, 113 U. S. 703.
The sleeping and parlor car proviso is an evasion as
against prior existing rights and is a law without a remedy.
The carriers operate under this law unevenly and oppressively to those of African descent.
The constitutional rights of citizens are not dependent
upon considerations nor upon the varying conditions and
circumstances. Citizens of African descent have no adequate remedy at law as the act provides no penalty for
the failure or the refusal to provide equal accommodations,
or chair cars, dining cars and sleeping cars, and said law
is unconstitutional and void.
The act violates §§ 22 and 25 of the Enabling Act under
which Oklahoma was admitted into the Union.
Race distinction in the law is any requirement by statute, constitutional, provisional or judicial legislation, that
a person act differently if he is a member of one or another
of the races in the United States. Congress intended tha
the only exception to the equality provision of the Enabling Act is that the State may establish and maintain
separate schools for the white and-tcolored children.
The State, after having accepted irrevocably the terms
and all of the terms of the Enabling Act, cannot thereafter be heard to complain or to repudiate any or all of such
terms. Frantz v. Autry, 91 Pac. Rep. 193.
The act conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is discriminatory. It was not passed for the health,
safety and comfort of its citizens, but as a subterfuge
under the guise of police power and police protection.
The danger does not justify the degree of restraint imposed, but the act is wholly racial and based upon race
and color as such.
An act that permits and even authorizes and directs
the excluding of one class of persons, and in this case the

negroes, from privileges and immunities enjoyed by everybody else similarly situated, and excluding the negro, and
leaving him without remedy, from the comforts and conveniences of chair cars, dining cars, sleeping cars, such as
are enjoyed by all other men; which deprives the negro of
the privileges and comforts which he enjoyed prior to the
passage of such act; which now imposes a fine upon the
negro if he attempts to exercise the rights which he enjoyed
before the passage of such act, must defeat the purpose,
defy the spirit, and violate the express provision of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.

This court has not jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
The Oklahoma Separate Coach Law is not violative of
the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United
States.
There is no charge that the railway companies are applying the state statute to interstate passengers.
The constitutionality of the Separate Coach Act is not
affected by the Enabling Act, nor does that law conflict
with the Fourteenth Amendment.

The purpose of the case is to prevent separation of races,
but the prayer only objects to distinction.
The proceeding cannot be one for mandatory injunction
for equal facilities, nor is the action one for damages.
The state statute requires equal comforts. Neither the
common law nor the Interstate Commerce Act gives a
right of action enforceable in a Federal court before any
application to the Interstate Commerce Commission as
to interstate traffic.
The right of action cannot arise out of state law for
want of jurisdiction in the lower court, nor can any right
of action arise out of the Enabling'Act or of the Constitution of the United States.
The plaintiffs do not allege lack of comforts under such
circumstances as are sufficient to compel their furnishing,
nor is any injury shown. Atlantic Coast Line v. Mazurky,

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
The legislature of the State of Oklahoma passed an act,
approved December 18, 1907 (Rev. Laws, Okla., 1910,
§§ 860 et seq.), known as the 'Separate Coach Law.' It
provided that 'every r'ailway company . . . doing
business, in this State, as a common carrier of passengers
for hire' should 'provide separate coaches or compartments, for the accommodation of the white and negro
races, which separate coaches or cars' should 'be equal
in all points of comfort and convenience' (§ 1); that at
passenger depots, there should be maintained 'separate
waiting rooms,' likewise with equal facilities (§ 2); that
the term negro, as used in the act, should include every
person of African descent, as defined by the state constitution (§ 3); and that each compartment of a railway
coach 'divided by a good and substantial wooden partition,
with a door therein, shall be deemed a separate coach'
within the meaning of the statute (§ 4).
It was ftirther provided that nothing contained in the
act should be construed to prevent railway companies
'from hauling sleeping cars, dining or chair cars attached'
to their trains to be used exclusively by either white or
negro passengers, separately but not jointly' (§ 7).
Other sections prescribed penalties both for carriers, and
for passengers, failing to observe the law (§§ 5, 6). The
act was to take effect sixty days after its approval (§ 12).
On February 15, 1908, just before the time when the
statute, by its terms, was to become effective, five negro

McCABE v. A., T. & S. F. RY. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

citizens of the State of Oklahoma (four of whom are
appellants here) brought this suit in equity against The
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, The
St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, The Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, The Chicago,
Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company and The Fort
Smith & Western Railroad Company, to restrain these
companies from making any distinction in service on
account of race. On February 26, 1908,-after the act
had been in operation for a few days-an amended bill
was filed seeking specifically to enjoin compliance with
the provisions of the statute for the reasorls that it was
repugnant (a) to the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution, (b) to the Enabling Act under which the
State of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union (act of
June. 16, 1906, c. 3335, § 3, 34 Stat. 267, 269), and (c) to
the Fourteenth Amendment. The railroad companies
severally demurred to the amended bill, asserting that it
failed to state a case entitling the complainants to relief
in equity. The Circuit Court sustained the demurrers
and, as the complainants elected to stand upon their bill,
final decree dismissing the bill was entered. This decree
was affirmed by the Court Circuit of Appeals (186 Fed.
Rep. 966), and the present appeal has been brought.
The conclusions of the court below as stated in its opinion were, in substance:
1. That under the Enabling Act, the State of Oklahoma
was admitted to the Union 'on an equal footing with the
original States' and with respect to the matter in question
had authority to enact such laws, not in conflict with the
Federal Constitution, as other States could enact; citing,

v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 573.

Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

2. That it had been decided by this court, so that the
question could no longer be considered an open one, that
it was not an infraction of the Fourteenth Amendment for
a State to require separate, but equal, accommodations
for the two races. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537.
3. That the provision of § 7, above quoted, relating to
sleeping cars, dining cars and chair cars did not offend
against the Fourteenth Amendment as these cars were,
comparatively speaking, luxuries, and that it was competent for the legislature to take into consideration the
limited demand for such accommodations by the one race,
as compared with the demand on the part of the other.
4. That in determining the validity of the statute the
doctrine that an act although 'fair on its face' might
be so unequally and oppressively administered by the
public authorities as to amount* to an unconstitutional
discrimination by the State itself (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118
U. S. 356, 373) was not applicable, as there was no basis
in the present case-for holding that any discriminations by
carriers which were unauthorized by the statute were
practised under state authority.
5. That the act, in the absence of a different construction by the state court, must be construed as applying to
transportation exclusively intrastate and hence did not
contravene the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Louisville &c. Ry. Co. v. Mississippi, 133 U. S.
587, 590; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, 179
U. S.388, 391; Chiles v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 218
U. S.71.
6. That with respect to the existence of discriminations the allegations of the bill were too vague and uncertain to entitle the complainants to a decree.
In view of the decisions of this court above cited, there
is no reason to doubt the correctness of the first, second,
fourth and fifth of these conclusions.
With the third, relating to § 7 of the statute, we are

McCABE v. A., T. & S. F. RY. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

unable to agree. It is not questioned that tle meaning of
this clause is that the carriers may provide sleeping cars,dining cars and chair cars exclusively for white persons
and provide no similar accommodations for negroes. The
reasoning is that there may not be enough persons of
African descent seeking these accommodations to warrant
the outlay in providing them. Thus, the Attorney General of the State, in the brief filed by him in support of the
law, urges that "the plaintiffs must show that their own
travel is in such quantity and of such kind as to actually
afford the roads the same profits, not per man, but per
car, as does the white traffic, or, sufficient profit to justify
the furnishing of the facility, and that in such case they
are not supplied with separate cars containing the same.
This they have not attempted. What vexes the plaintiffs is the limited market value they offer for such accommodations. Defendants are not by law compelled
to furnish chair cars, diners nor sleepers, except when the
market offered reasonably demands the facility." And
in the brief of counsel for the appellees, it is stated that
the members of the legislature "were undoubtedly familiar
with the character and extent of travel of persons of
African descent in the State of Oklahoma and were of the
opinion that there was no substantial demand for Pullman car and dining car service for persons of the African
race in the intrastate travel" in that State.
This argument with respect to volume of traffic seems
to'us to be without merit. It makes the constitutional
right depend upon the number of.persons who may be
discriminated against, whereas the essence of the constitutional right is that it is a personal one, Whether or
not particular facilities shall be provided may doubtless
be conditioned upon there -being a reasonable demand.

the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied by a
common carrier, acting in the matter under the authority
of a state law, a facility or convenience in the course of his
journey which under substantially the same circumstances
is furnished to another traveler, he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded.
There is, however, an insuperable obstacle to the
granting of the relief sought by this bill. It was filed, as
we have seen, by five persons against five railroad corporations to restrain them from complying with the state
statute. The suit had been brought before the law went
into effect and this amended bill was filed very shortly
after. It contains-some general allegations as to discriminations in the supply of facilities and as to the hardships
which will ensue. It states that there will be 'a multiplicity of suits,' there being at least 'fifty thousand persons of the negro race in the State of Oklahoma' who will
be injured and deprived of their civil rights. But we are
dealing here with the case of the complainants, and
nothing is shown to entitle them to an injunction. It is
an elementary principle that, in order to justify the granting of this extraordinary relief, the complainant's need
of it, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law, must
clearly appear. The complainant cannot succeed because
someone else may be hurt. Nor does it make any difference that other persons, who may be injured are persons
of the same race or occupation. It is the fact, clearly
established, of injury to the complainant-not to otherswhich justifies judicial intervention. Williams v. Hagood,
98 U. S. 72, 74, 75; Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S. 325,
328, 329; Tyler v. Judges, 179 U. S. 405, 406; Turpin v.

Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U. S. 192,
197; Collins v. Texas, 223 U. S. 288, 295, 296.
The allegations of the amended bill, so far as they pur-

McCABE v. A., T. & S. F. RY. CO.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

port to show discriminations in the conduct of these car-

riers, are these:
"That notwithstanding the terms of said Act of Congress and of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma,
the said above named defendants and each of them are
making distinctions in the civil rights of your orators
and of all other persons of the negro race and persons of
the white race in the conduct and operation of its trains
and passenger service in the State of Oklahoma, in this,
to wit: that equal comforts, conveniences and accommodations will not be provided for your orators and other
persons of the negro race; that said passenger coaches
are not constructed or maintained so as to enable persons
of the negro race to be provided with separate and equal
toilet and waiting rooms for male and female passengers
of said negro race, nor have equal smoking car accommodations, nor separate and equal chair cars, sleeping cars
and dining car accommodations by providing for your
orators and other persons of the negro race who may become passengers on said railroad, that separate waiting
rooms with equal comforts and conveniences have been
or are bound to be constructed by said defendants and
each of them for your orators and other persons of the
negro race desiring to become passengers on said railroad,
and that said orators are not being and will not be provided with equal accommodations with the white race
under the provisions of said act."
We agree with the court below that these allegations
are altogether too vague and indefinite to warrant the
relief sought by these complainants. It is not alleged that
any one of the complainants has ever traveled on any one
of the five railroads, or has ever requested transportation
on any of them; or that any one of the complainants has
ever requested that accommodations be furnished to him
in any sleeping cars, dining cars or chair cars; or that
any of these five companies has ever notified any one of

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

these complainants that such accommodations would not
be furnished to him, when furnished to others, upon reasonable request and payment of the customary charge.
Nor is there'anything to show that in case any of these
complainants offers himself as a passenger on any of these
roads and is refused accommodations equal to those afforded to others on a like journey, he will not have an
adequate remedy at law. The desire to obtain a sweeping
injunction cannot be accepted as.a substitute for compliance with the general rule that the .complainant must
present facts sufficient to show that his individual need
requires the remedy for which he asks. The bill is wholly
