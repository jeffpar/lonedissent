shows that it is impossible in the operation of the cars
to keep them uniformly up to this temperature, owing to
the opening and closing of doors, and other interferences
that make it impracticable. We therefore think, upon
this showing, this feature of the ordinance is unreasonable and cannot be sustained.
Our conclusion is that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky erred in refusing the injunction as against the
provisions of the ordinance regulating the number of
passengers to be carried in a car and the number of cars
to be provided, and the requirement as to heating in
view of the testimony as heretofore stated. In these
respects its decision should be reversed. We think the
other provisions of the ordinance separable and concerning them the plaintiff in error was not entitled to an injunction in the state court.
Judgment is reversed, in part, and the case remanded
to the state court for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

expressly excluding earnings derived from bfisiness of an interstate
character, is not violative of the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution, and so held as to § 184 of the Tax Laws of New
York.
Such a tax is,not, as to a corporation transporting merchandise on
navigable waters, a license tax for the privilege of navigating public
waters of the United States which is granted by Federal law, but
merely a privilege for carrying on the business in a corporate capacity. Harman v. Chicago, 147 U. S.396, distinguished.
While a State may not require a navigation license except in exceptional
cases, as for compensation for improvements made by itself, it may,
as to its own corporations having property within its borders, enforce
its usual and customary system of taxation without infraction of the
superior authority and laws of the United States concerning navigation.
Transportation between ports of a State is not interstate commerce to
the extent of being excluded from the taxing power of the State
because a part of the journey is over the territory of another State;

Within the limits set by these two clauses the power

of the Federal Government over navigable waters is absolute and exclusive. But that power relates to the subjects specified in the Constitution and is not determined
by places in which it is to be exercised. It is a jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the traffic carried on over
navigable streams, and only incidentally over the streams
themselves in the interest of such traffic.
So long as the State does not regulate either interstate
commerce or maritime jurisdiction its laws affecting business on the Hudson river are valid, and the mere fact that
the Hudson is navigable does not preclude the State from
regulating its use.
The Tax Law is not a regulation of the stream; it is a
regulation of the business upon it and only of the business
within the State. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania,
114 U. S. 211.
The law of a State, which does not regulate interstate
commerce or the use of the stream, does not trench upon
the Federal powers. See Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry., 142
U. S. 217, and the following cases in which it has since
been cited as authority: Hanley v. Kansas City Railway,
187 U. S. 617; Mich. Cent. R. R. v. Powers, 201 U. S. 245,

All that is attempted in § 184 of the Tax Law is to tax
a corporate franchise tax using the gross earnings of the
company as a measure for the value of the exercise of such
franchise. See Annan-v. Walsh, and Budd v. New York,
143 U. S.517.
The gross earnings by which the tax on the corporate
franchises of the relator is measured were not derived from
business of an interstate character.

Under the treaty of 1833 the territorial boundary between the States of New York and New Jersey on the
surface of the waters of the Hudson river up to Spuytert
Duyvil creek and in New York bay, is the low-water
mark on the New Jersey shore. On the surface of the
water the jurisdiction of New York extends to the New
Jersey shore. A boat on the surface, not attached to
a wharf, is in New York. Carlin v, Railroad Co., 135
App. Div. 876, 880; Fergusonv. Ross, 126 N. Y. 463.
Even if any of the tows passed through the State of
New Jersey, for the west half of the Hudson for about
ten miles north of Spuyten Duyvil. creek is within New
Jersey, and if they kept to the west of the center
of the stream they were for those few miles in New
Jersey, this does not, however, constitute interstate commerce.
Transportation of goods by railroad from one point
within a State to another point within it, but passing
through another State during transit, is not an interstate shipment and does not constitute interstate commerce. Lehigh Valley R. R. v. Pennsylvania, 145 U. S.
192; Kellogg v. Lehigh Valley R. R., 115 Fed. Rep. 373;
Lord v. Steamship Co., 102 U. S. 541.
There is no distinction between transportation by rail
and by water. In either case the transportation of goods
between two points in the same State, but through another State, is not interstate commerce. Pennsylvania

New Jersey, to another point in New York State, is not
an interstate shipment and not an interference with
the exclusive control of Congress over interstate commerce.

other State than New York, the towing service was no
part of a continuous carriage between States. Int. Com.

of an interstate character, yet the State could constitutionally and legally measure its tax on the exercise of the
franchises of its domestic corporations by such gross earnings: Home Ins. Co. v. New York, 134 U. S. 594; Ewing

MR.

JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

The proceeding which resulted in the judgment here
complained of originated in an application by the Cornell
Steamboat Company to review by certiorari a decision of
the Comptroller of New York, denying a petition for revision and readjustment of taxes imposed by the Comptroller on the Steamboat Company for the years 1902 and
1903. These taxes were imposed under § 184 of the Tax
Laws of New York (c. 60, Consolidated Laws), which, so
far as it is pertinent here, reads:
"Section 184. Additional franchise tax on transporta-

tion and transmission corporations and associations.Every corporation
formed for . .
navigation . . . purposes
shall pay for the privilege of e:Fercising its corporate franchises or carrying on
its business in such corporate or organized capacity in
this state, an annual excise tax or license fee which shall be
equal to five-tenths of one per centum upon its gross earnings within this state, which shall include its gross earnings
from its transportation or transmission business originating and terminating within this state, buit shall not include
earnings derived from business of an interstate-character."
In the years 1902 and 1903, the Comptroller of the
State imposed upon the Steamboat Company taxes on its
earnings for those years, and denied the application for a
revision and readjustment. The writ of certiorari was
afterwards issued from the Supreme Court of New York
upon petition to review and correct the determination of
the Comptroller. The matter was heard in the appellate
division of the Supreme Court of New York, and that
court affirmed the determination of the Comptroller. Appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals of New York, and
that court affirmed the order appealed from, and remitted
the case to the Supreme Court of the State. (206 N. Y.
651.) This writ of error is sued out to reverse the judgment.
Taxes were assessed upon the return of the Steamboat
Company for the year 1902: "gross earnings, not interstate business, derived from all sources during the above
period, $377,146.33;" also on the return for the year 1903:
"gross earnings on business commenced and terminated
inthe territorial limits of New York, derived from towing
charges upon the Hudson River (navigable waters of the
United States), earned with vessels enrolled and licensed
by the U. S. Government, i. e., business which is regulated
by the U. S. Government, and which it is claimed is not
taxable by the State of New York, $394,505.59;" which

Opinion of the Court.

return was followed by a supplemental return: "State of
New York, County of Ulster, ss. George Coykendall, being
duly sworn, says that he is the Vice-President of the
Cornell Steamboat Company; that the report of gross
earnings in the State of New York, of the Cornell Steamboat Company for the year ending June 30, 1903, verified
by me on September 17, 1903, should be amended as follows: That the statement in such report of business commenced and terminated within the territorial limits of the
State of New 'Pork, derived from towing charges upon the
Hudson River, is made up largely-of towing done in the
following manner, as deponent knows from personal
knowledge and information derived from the Superintendent of the company, to wit: Tows for up-river points
on the Hudson River are made up at a stakeboat located
at Weehawken, within the territorial limits of the State of
New Jersey; that there are two stakeboats anchored in the
river just below Weehawken ferry; that vessels and. boats
reported for the up-river tows are taken out to the stakeboats and there made fast, and the tow is there made up,
the towing vessels are attached, and the course pursued
by the steamers in going up the river is in the Territory of
New York and New Jersey; that tows coming down the
river pursue a like course, going into the territory of both
States, and when the tow arrives in New York harbor, the
entire tow, or the greater part thereof, is, as a usual thing,
turned in the river, going into the territory of New Jersey
and making the turn. Deponent further says that nearly
all earnings of the company are from business done within
the territorial limits of New York and New Jersey, to
such extent as the State of New Jersey is included in the
Hudson River and New York Bay, and that it is absolutely'
impossible to state just when the vessels are within the
territorial limits of either State. Deponent. further says
that he desires to file this affidavit as a correction of the
report verified September 17, 1903, by him, .which report

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

was filed with the State Comptroller on or about the 17th
day of September 1903."
These returns may be supplemented by a statement
from the brief of plaintiff in error, derived from the record,
as to the manner in which the towing business of the
Company was done: "The tows were made up in the
Hudson River at Albany, N. Y., or its vicinity, and the
Steamboat Company, the plaintiff in error, thereupon
attached a towing line connecting the tows with its tugs
or steamers and moved the tows down or up the river,
leaving the tows up-bound in the river at Albany or its
immediate vicinity and those bound down the river in the
bay at New York City or in the waters adjacent thereto."
It is apparent from a consideration of § 184 that the
tax here imposed upon transmission and transportation
corporations is for the privilege of carrying on the business
in a corporate capacity Within the State of New York,
for which an annual excise tax or license fee is exacted
equal to five-tenths of one per centum upon the gross
earnings on transportation originating and terminating
in the State of Ndw York. By its express terms, the
statute provides that the tax shall not include earnings
derived from business of an interstate character.
,It is- contended that as the business of towing carried
on by the plaintiff company is done upon the navigable
waters of the United States, and under authority of a
license granted by the United States, the State has no
jurisdiction or authority to levy the tax in question, and
that it is in reality and substance an attempt to enforce
a license tax for the privilege of navigating the public
waters of the United States, a privilege already granted
under the general government. (See §§ 4400 and 4401.of
the Revised Statutes of the United States, and also §§ 4438,
4439, 4440, 4441, 4442 and 4443, providing for the license
of officers of vessels.)
The right of the Federal Government to regulate com-

CORNELL STEAMBOAT CO. v. SOHMER.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

merce, under Article 1, § 8, Subdivision 3, of the Federal Constitution, giving Congress control over interstate
commerce, confers the supreme authority over navigable
rivers and streams for the purpose of regulating navigation,
and all that pertains thereto; and under this authority
the Federal Government is supreme and may not be
interfered with by the laws of the States. The subject
is fully discussed in United States v. Chandler-Dunbar
Water Power Co., 209 U. S. 447. The tax here in question
does not impose a license tax as a prerequisite to the
navigation of the river, as was the case in Harman v.
Chicago, 147 U. S. 396, cited and relied upon by the
plaintiff in error, where an ordinance of the City of
Chicago, imposing a license tax for the privilege of navigating the Chicago River and its branches by steam tugs
licensed under the Federal authority, was held an unconstitutional exaction, as it required payment for a
privilege which had already been granted within the
authority of the Federal Government.
In the case now before the court, the tax, as was said
by Chief Judge Cullen, in delivering an opinion in the
Court of Appeals in New York in this case, concurring
in the order affirming the court below Without opinion,
is levied upon the corporation for the privilege of carrying
on its business in a corporate or organized capacity.
As the Chief Judge says, if the parties beneficially interested in the company are dissatisfied with the price
exacted by the State for this privilege they may carry on
the business as individuals without paying any charge.
In other words, the charge is not upon the navigation of
the river, but is upon the doing of business as a corporation of the State within the State. While the State may
not require a navigation license except in very exceptional
cases, as for compensation for improvements which thr
State has made, a situation not presented here, it may,
certainly as to a corporation of its own creation having

property within its borders enforce its usual and customary
systems of taxation without infraction of the superior
authority and laws of the United States concerning the
navigation of rivers.
With this view of the tax now under consideration, we
think the State did not exceed its authority in its imposition of a tax for the purpose stated.
But it is urged that this is a tax upon interstate commerce, and therefore beyond the power of the State, notwithstanding the statute undertakes to exempt the proceeds of interstate commerce from taxation. That interstate commerce is necessarily taxed is said to arise from
the fact that the business of the Company is in fact interstate commerce, as shown by its additional return, from
which it appears that vessels for up-river points on the
Hudson River are taken by tows, which are made up at a
stakeboat located at Weehawken, which is within the
territorial limits of New Jersey, that these stakeboats are
anchored in the river just below Weehawken ferry, and
that the course up the river is in territory of New York
and New Jersey. But transportation between the ports
of the State is not interstate commerce, excluded from the
taxing power of the State, because as to a part of the
journey the course is over the territory of another State.
Lehigh Valley Railroad v. Pennsylvania, 145 U. S. 192;
Ewing v. City of Leavenworth, 226 U. S. 464, and see
Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U. S. 179, 183. Weehawken is opposite New York harbor, and the business
upon which the tax is here imposed is all done between
New York ports, and the record shows distinctly that no
earnings were returned for tugs operated in New York
harbor and ports outside the State. Such business was
deducted as interstate business and not taxable under the
terms of the statute. It is evident that the making up of
the tows for the State ports in the river below Weehawken
was for convenience in conducting domestic transportation..

Syllabus.

We are of the opinion that commerce thus carried on is
not interstate commerce, beyond the taxing power of the
State, and that the return on which the tax was assessed
did not involve the revenues of commerce among the
States, and this -contention must be rejected.
It follows that the decision of the Supreme Court of
New York must be

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT.
No. 97.

Argued December 4, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

As § 37, Judicial Code, does not prescribe any particular mode by which
the question of jurisdiction shall be raised, the method of raising that
question may be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge; and,
if the state practice admits, the issue may be raised by general denial
in the answer.
While the trial court may submit the question of a party's residence to
the jury, it is not bound to do so; and in this case the court properly
exercised its privilege to dispose of that issue on the testimony.
In this case the defendant was not chargeable with laches because he
did not force to trial the issue of plaintiff's citizenship.
The fact that delay in determining the issue of citizenship results in the
statute of limitations applying, does not confer jurisdiction on the
Federal court if diverse citizenship does not exist.
Where the record in a case dismissed by th6 District Court for want of
jurisdiction on account of absence of diverse citizenship brings up
the testimony, this court must consider it and determine whether
the trial court rightly decided that plaintiff was a citizen of the same
State as defendant.
If plaintiff, at the commencement of the action, be domiciled in a dif-
