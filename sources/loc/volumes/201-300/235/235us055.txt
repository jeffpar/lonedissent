UNITED STATES v. MAYER, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 462.

Argued October 22, 23, 1914.-Decided November 16, 1914.

While their jurisdiction is exclusively appellate, Circuit Courts of
Appeals may issue writs which are properly auxiliary to their appellate power.
While this court may not be required through a certificate under § 239,
Judicial Code, to pass upon questions of fact or mixed questions of
law and fact, or to accept a transfer of the whole case, or to answer
questions of objectionable generality, a definite question of law may
be submitted even if decisive of the controversy.
The general principle obtains, in the absence of statuteproviding otherwise, that a court cannot set aside or alter its final judgment after
the expiration of the term at which it was entered unless the proceeding for that purpose was begun during that term; and this case
does not fall within the exceptions to that rule.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Statement of the Case.

235 U. S.

Whether a Federal court can grant a new trial after the end of the
term is a question of power and not of procedure, and state statutes
are not applicable.
When a writ of error has been issued to review a judgment of conviction of the District Court in a criminal cause, the Circuit Court of
Appeals has jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition against the
District Court entering an order for new trial after expiration of the
term on newly discovered evidence.
When a writ of error has been issued to review its judgment of conviction in a criminal cause, the District Court has not jurisdiction, upon
motion made after the term at which it was entered, to set the judgment aside and order a new trial on facts discovered after the end
of the term and not appearing in the record.
When a District Court has itself raised the question of its jurisdiction
,to entertain a motion made after expiration of. the term to vacate a
judgment of conviction, the consent of the United States attorney
to consider the case on the merits does not confer jurisdiction, nor
debar the United States from raising the question of jurisdiction, to
vacate the judgment.
THE facts stated in the certificate may be summarized

as follows:
On March 14, 1913, one Albert Freeman with two other
-individuals, was convicted in the District Court, Southern
District of New York, on five indictments for violation of
the statutes relating to the use of the mails and for a
conspiracy. On that day judgments of conviction were
entered and sentences were imposed as to certain of these
indictments, or counts therein, sentence being suspended
as to others; and on March 24, 1913, the defendant
Freeman sued out a writ of error from the Circuit Court
of Appeals to review the judgments of conviction. Assignments of error were filed; and on May 13, 1913, the plaintiff
in error was admitted to bail by the appellate court. No bill
of exceptions has been settled or filed or argument had.
On January 12, 1914, the plaintiff in error gave notice of
application in the District Court to set aside the judgments of conviction, and for the quashing of the indictments, or for a new trial. The grounds were, among

UNITED STATES v. MAYER.

Statement of the Case.

others, (1) that the defendant had been deprived of a
fair trial by the misconduct of an assistant United States
attorney and (2) that one juror when examined on his
voir dire concealed a bias against the defendant. It is
found as a fact by the District Judge, that neither the
defendant nor his counsel had knowledge of the facts on
which the motion was based until after the conclusion of
the trial and the expiration of the term as to those counts
upon which sentence had been imposed, and that these
facts could not have been discovered earlier by reasonable
diligence:
Upon the hearing of the application, District Judge
Mayer raised the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain it, in view of the fact that the
term had expired. Thereupon the United States attorney
submitted a memorandum tendering his consent that the
application be heard upon the merits. The application was
heard and District Judge Mayer handed down his decision
granting a new trial, "on the ground that defendant had
not had a trial by an impartial jury for the reason that
one of the jurors at the tinge of his selection entertained a
bias against the defendant resulting from the juror's
observations of the conduct of the defendant and other
corporate officers in relation to the production of certain
corporate records before a grand jury of which he had
been a member, the juror having concealed his bias on his
examination on the voir dire for the purpose of securing
the jury fees and the events of the trial having been such
as to strengthen and confirm this bias." The order
vacating the judgments of conviction and granting a new
trial has not yet been entered, the District Judge having
filed a memorandum stating in substance that the question of jurisdiction was an important one and that the
order would be withheld until the United States attorney
had an opportunity to raise the question in a higher
court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Statement of the Case.

235 U. S.

Thereafter, and on April 6, 1914, the United States
attorney procured an order in the Circuit Court of Appeals
directing District Judge Mayer to show cause why a writ
of prohibition should not be issued from that court forbidding the entry of an order vacating the judgments of
conviction and granting a new trial upon the ground that
the District Court was without jurisdiction to enter it.
Certain of the facts upon which the motion for a new trial
was granted do not appear in the record of the previous
trial.
The questions certified are:
" QUESTION I.

"A. When a writ of error has been issued to review a
judgment of conviction in a criminal cause entered in a
District Court and thereafter, upon a motion made in the
District Court after the expiration of the term at which
the judgment was entered, said District Court has indicated its intention to enter an order vacating the judgment and ordering a new trial on facts discovered after
the expiration of said term and not appearing in the record
of the previous trial, has the Circuit Court of Appeals
jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition against the entry
of such order by the District Court, when, in the opinion of
the Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court is without
jurisdiction to enter such order?
"B. Or has the Supreme Court of the United States sole
jurisdiction to issue such writ of prohibition,. under the
circumstances above stated?
"In Case question I A be answered in the affirmative,
then"QUESTION

II.

"When a writ of error has been issued to review a judgment of conviction in a criminal cause entered ina District
Court, has the. District Court, upon a motion made after

UNITED STATES v. MAYER.
235 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

the term at which judgment was entered, jurisdiction to
set aside the judgment and order a new trial on facts
discovered after the expiration of said term and not
appearing in the record of the previous trial?
"QUESTION III.

"Whether, when a District Court has itself raised the
question of its jurisdiction to entertain a motion made
after the expiration of the term to vacate a judgment of
conviction and the United States attorney. thereupon
tendered its consent to the hearing of the motion on the
merits if the jurisdictional question raised by the court
were dependent on that consent, the United States is
debarred by such tender from raising the question of
jurisdiction of the District Court to vacate said judgment?
The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey was on the brief, for the United States:
The Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue
the writ of prohibition in order to prevent threatened
interference with its appellate jurisdiction by the District
Court granting a new trial in a case in which a writ of
error has been filed. The writ of prohibition is the appropriate remedy. Zell v. Judges, 149 Fed. Rep. 86, 91.
The Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of the
main cause. In re Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443. Its jurisdiction attached upon the filing of the writ of error with the
clerk of the District Court. Brooks v. Norris, 11 How.
203; Burnham v. North Chicago Ry. Co., 87 Fed. Rep. 168.
If the Circuit Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to
issue the writ,\ this court has sole jurisdiction to issue it.
In exceptional cases this court has granted the writ of
certiorari, although neither appellate nor original jurisdiction existed. McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268;
Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 234 U. S. 749; Munsuri
v. Lord, 229 U. S. 618; Whitney v. Dick, 202 U. S. 132.

And so, by analogy, the writ of prohibition is available
where, as here, it is the only remedy by which the usarpation of jurisdiction by an inferior Federal court can be
prevented.
The. District Court is without jurisdiction to set aside
the judgment of conviction and order a new trial. The
expiration of the term at which judgment was entered
withdrew that judgment from the control of the District
Court. Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415; Hickman
v. Fort Scott, 141 U. S. 415; Wetmore v. Karrick, 205
U. S. 141.

jurisdiction of the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals.

This rule obtains also in the matter of appeals in equity
cases. Ensminger v. Powers, 108 V. S. 292; Roemer v.
Simon, 91 U. S. 149.
The United States is not debarred from raising the
question of the District Court's jurisdiction by the consent of the United States attorney to the hearing of the
motion on its merits.
Jurisdiction of the subject-matter cannot be conferred
by consent of the parties. In re Winn, 213 U. S.458, 469;
Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S. 48, 62;
Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185-U. S.373, 382.
The question is one of power; and that is a question
which cannot be solved by consent of either party. Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S.410.
Mr. Wilson B. Brice, with whom Mr. Samuel Williston
was on the brief, for respondent:
Only questions arising in cases within the appellate
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals can be certified to the Supreme Court. Maynard v. Hecht, 151 U. S.
324; Moran v. Hegeman, 151 U. S.329.

UNITED STATES v. MAYER.
235 U. S.

Argument for Respondent.

The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals to issue
the writ of prohibition is an original jurisdiction. Section
262, Judicial Code; Farnsworthv. Montana, 129 U. S. 104,

482, 488; Covington Bridge Co. v. Hager, 203 U. S. 109.
Congress has never intended to change the common-law
nature of an application for a writ of prohibition.
The questions submitted do not appear to be of such
nature as to call upon this court to answer them.
The whole case cannot be sent to this court by certificate of division of opinion.
This defect cannot be avoided by submitting the whole
case in the form of separate questions.
It does not make any difference if the decision of the
whole case turns upon matters of law only, nor will this
court answer abstract, hypothetical or moot questions.
If an answer to one of the questions certified disposes
of the case, this court will not answer the other questions.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Respondent.

235 U. S.

If the right to a writ of error does exist in the Government, then it has another remedy in this case; and it is
not entitled to the writ of prohibition because the issue of
the writ would not be necessary to the exercise of the
appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals.
See United States v. Dickinson, 213 U. S. 99.
Section 262, Judicial Code, does not confer an appellate
jurisdiction which the Circuit Court of Appeals would
not have without it. The statutes which it reenacts
have been construed as meaning' that the power of the
Circuit Court to use extraordinary writs is confined to
their use as ancillary remedies in cases where appellate
jurisdiction already exists. McClung v. Silliman, 6
Wheat. 598; Bath County v. Amy, 13 Wall. 244, 249;
Covington Bridge Co. v. Hager, 203 U. S. 109; Re Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 482, 488; Ex parte Warmouth, 17 Wall.

Paquet, 114 Fed. Rep. 437; Zell v. Judges &c., 149 Fed.

The Government has no legal right to any relief under
the writ of error. Latham v. United States, 9 Wall. 145;
United States v. Minn. &c. Co., 18 How; 241; United
States v. Young, 94 U. S. 258.
The Government cannot question the District Court's
jurisdiction. United States v. Perrin, 131 U. S. 55, and
see also McLish v. Roff, 141 U. S. 661, 668; United States
v. Jahn, 155 U. S. 109; Mexican Cent. Ry. Co. v. Eckman,

The consent given by the United States attorney deprived the Circuit Court of Appeals of any jurisdiction
to issue the writ of prohibition, even if it would otherwise
have had any.

circumstances of this case, is not before the court, and an
answer, if given, would be mere obiter.
There has been a gradual tendency to enlarge the exceptions to the general rule denying the power of a court
to amend its judgments after the term. See essay by
Luke 0. Pike, 7 Harv. Law Rev. 266, 272.
Originally the difficulty of amendment seems to have
existed whenever the term was past even though the suit
was still pending. 3 Blackstone, 406; Queen v. Tutchin,

566; Harmon v. Martin, 52 Vermont, 255; Avery v. United
States, 12 Wall. 304.
The writ was not available in criminal cases.
As to writ of error coram nobis or coram vobis, see United
States v. Plumer, 3 Cliff. 28, 58. The writ is directed only
to the court which rendered the judgment, not to a superior court, Irwin v. Grey, L. R., 2 H. L. 20, 26; Land

Even though the lapse of the term deprived the District
Court of jurisdiction, the Government's consent to the
hearing of the motion for a new trial restored that jurisdiction. Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 699; Taylor v. Longworth, 14 Pet. 172, 174; St. Louis &c. Ry. v. McBride, 141

282; Anderson v. Thompson, 7 Lea, 259, are opposed to
principle, to practical convenience and to the weight of
authority.
The Government is as fully bound by the assent given
by the District Attorney who represented it as an ordinary litigant would be by the assent of authorized
counsel. Johnston v. Stimmel, 89 N. Y. 117.
The pendency of a writ of error when the motion for a

UNITED STATES v. MAYER.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

new trial was made did not defeat the jurisdiction of the
District Court.
Consent to the jurisdiction of the District Court involves consent to the discontinuance of the writ of error
if the District Court grants a new trial, and, therefore,
avoids any possible objection due to the pendency of the
writ of error.
The motive of the Government in giving its consent
is immaterial.
Failure to object to jurisdiction debars the right to the
writ. Re Huguley Mfg. Co., 184 U. S. 301; In re A lix, 166
U. S. 136; In re Rice, 155 U. S.396; Smith v. Whitney, 116
.U.S. 167, 173.
The Government is debarred from the writ because it
has no standing in the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the
writ of error.
MR.JUSTICE HUGHES, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

Preliminarily, objection is raised to the authority of
this court to answer the questions certified. Under § 239
of the Judicial Code, questions may be certified by the
Circuit Court of Appeals "in any case within its appellate
jurisdiction, as defined in section one hundred and twentyeight"; and § 128 provides that the Circuit Courts of Appeals "shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or writ of error final decisions in the District Court,"
etc. The argument is that an application to a Circuit Court
of Appeals for a writ of prohibition is an original proceeding. But the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of Appeals
is exclusively appellate (Act of March 3, 1891, §§ 2, 6,
c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 828; Jud. Code, §§ 117, 128; Whitney
v. Dick, 202 U. S. 132, 137, 138); and their authority to
issue writs is only that which may properly be deemed
to be auxiliary to their appellate power. Jud. Code.

§ 262; Rev. Stat., § 716; Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,
§ 12, 26 Stat. 826, 829; Whitney v. Dick, supra; McClellan
v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 279, 280. Section 128 defines
the class of cases in which the Circuit Court of Appeals
may exercise appellate jurisdiction, and, where a case
falls within this class, a proceeding to procure the issue
of a writ in aid of the exercise of that jurisdiction must be
regarded as incidental thereto and hence as being embraced within the purview of § 239 authorizing the court
to certify questions of law.
It is also objected that the certificate sends up the entire
case. It is a familiar rule that this court can not be required through a certificate under § 239 to pass upon
questions of fact, or mixed questions of law and fact; or to
accept a transfer of the whole case; or to answer questions
of objectionable generality-which instead of presenting
distinct propositions of law cover unstated matters
'lurking in the record '-or questions that are hypothetical
and speculative. United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 267, 273;

hand, there is no objection to the submission of a definite
and clean-cut question of law merely because the answer
may be decisive of the controversy. The question propoundedmust always be such that the answer will aid the
court in the determination of the case, and the importance,
or the controlling character, of the question if suitably
specific furnishes no ground for its disallowance. This is
abundantly illustrated in the decisions. United States v.

Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, 233 U. S. 157; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Behrens, 233 U. S. 473. In the present
case the certificate submits distinct and definite questions
of law, which-save question I-B-are clearly pertinent.
Coming, then, to the matters thus submitted, we deem
the following considerations to be controlling:
1. In the absence of statute providing otherwise, the
general principle obtains that a court cannot set aside or
alter its final judgment after the expiration of the term at
which it was entered, unless the proceeding for that purpose was begun during that term. Hudson v. Guestier,
7 Cranch, 1; Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3 Wheat. 591; Ex parte
Sibbald, 12 Pet. 488, 492; Bank of United States v. Moss,
6 How. 31, 38; Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415-417;
Phillips v. Negley, 117 U. S. 665, 673, 674; Hickman v.
Fort Scott, 141 U. S. 415; Hume v. Bowie, 148 U. S. 245,

Karrick, 205 U. S. 141, 149-152; In re Metropolitan Trust
Co., 218 U. S. 312, 320, 321. There are certain exceptions.
In the case of courts of common law-and we are not here
concerned with the special grounds upon which courts of
equity afford relief-the court at a. subsequent term has
power to correct inaccuracies in mere matters of form, or
clerical errors, and, in civil cases, to rectify such mistakes
of fact as were reviewable on writs of error coram nobis, or
coram vobis, for which the proceeding by motion is the

Schulten, supra; Phillips v. Negley, supra; In re Wight,
134 U. S. 136; Wetmore v. Karrick, supra. These writs
were available to bring before the court that pronounced
the judgment errors in matters of fact which had not been
put in issue or passed upon and were material to the
validity and regularity of the legal proceeding itself; as
where the defendant, being under age, appeared by
attorney, or the plaintiff or defendant was a married
woman at the time of commencing the suit, or died before
verdict or interlocutory judgment,-for, it was said, 'error
in fact is not the error of the judges and reversing it is not
reversing their own judgment.' So, if there were error in
the process, or through the default of the clerks, the same
proceeding might be had to procure a reversal. But if
the error were 'in the judgment itself, and not in the
process,' a writ of error did not lie in the same court
upon the judgment, but only in another and superior
court. Tidd, 9th ed., 1136, 1137; Stephen on Pleading,
119; 1 Roll. Abr. 746, 747, 749. In criminal cases, however, error would lie in the King's Bench whether the
error was in fact or law. Tidd, 1137; 3 Bac. Abr. (Bouv.
ed.) "Error," 366; Chitty, Crim. L. 156, 749. See United
States v. Plumer, 3 Cliff. 28, 59, 60. The errors of law
which were thus subject to examination were only those
disclosed by the record, and as the record was so drawn
up that it did not show errors in the reception or rejection
of evidence, or misdirections by the judge, the remedy
applied 'only to that very small number of legal questions' which concerned 'the regularity of the proceedings
themselves.' See Report, Royal Commission on Criminal
Code (1879), p. 37; 1 Stephen, Hist. Crim. L. 309, 310.
In view of the statutory and limited jurisdiction of the
Federal District Courts, and of the specific provisions for
the review of their judgments on writ of error, there would
appear to be no basis for the conclusion that, after the
term, these courts in common law actions, whether civil or

criminal, can set aside or modify their final judgments for
errors of law; and even if it be assumed that in the case
of errors in certain matters of fact, the district courts may
exercise in criminal cases-as an incident to their powers
expressly granted-a correctional jurisdiction at subsequent terms analogous to that exercised at common law
on writs of error coram nobis (See Bishop, New Crim. Pro.,
2d ed., § 1369), as to which we express no opinion, that
authority would not reach the present case. This jurisdiction was of limited scope; the power of the court thus to
vacate its judgments for errors of fact existed, as already
stated, in those cases where the errors were of the most
fundamental character, that is, such as rendered the
proceeding itself irregular and invalid. In cases of prejudicial misconduct in the course of the trial, the misbehavior or partiality of jurors, and newly discovered
evidence, as well as where it is sought to have the court
in which the case was tried reconsider its rulings, the
remedy is by a motion for a new trial (Jud. Code, § 269)an application which is addressed to the sound discretion
of the trial court, and, in accordance with the 'established
principles which have been repeatedly set forth in the
decisions of this court above cited, cannot be entertained,
in the absence of a -different statutory rule, after the
expiration of the term at which the judgment was entered.
State statutes relating to the granting of new trials are
not applicable. As was said by this court in Bronson v.
Schulten, supra,-"The question relates to the power of
the courts and not to the mode of procedure. It is whether
there exists in the court the authority to set aside, vacate,
and modify its final judgments after the term at which
they were rendered; and this authority can neither be
conferred upon nor withheld from the courts of the United
States by the statutes of a State or the practice of its
courts." See, also, Ind. & St. L. R. R. Co. v. Horst, 93

2. As the District Court was without power to entertain the application, thp consent of the United States
attorney was unavailing. Cutler v. Rae, 7 How. 729,
731; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608, 618; Minnesota
v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, 382. It is argued, in substance,
that while consent cannot give jurisdiction over the subject matter, restrictions as to place, time, etc., can be
waived. Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 699; Toland v.
Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 331; Ayers v. Watson, 113 U. S.
594, 598; Martin's Adm'r v. B. & 0. R. R. 'Co., 151 U. S.
673, 688; Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke Co., 228 U. S. 339,
344, 345. This consideration is without pertinency here,
for there was no general jurisdiction over the subject
matter, and it is not a question of the waiver of mere
'modal or formal' requirements, of mere private right or
personal privilege. In a Federal court of competent jurisdiction, final judgment of conviction had been entered and
sentence had been imposed. The judgment was subject
to review in the appellate court, but so far as the trial
court was concerned it was a finality; the subsequent
proceeding was, in effect, a new proceeding which by
reason of its character invoked an authority not possessed.
In these circumstances it would seem to be. clear that the
consent of the prosecuting officer could not alter the case;
he was not a dispensing power to give or withhold jurisdiction. The established rule embodies the policy of the
law that litigation be finally terminated, and when the
matter is thus placed beyond the discretion of the court
it is not confided to the discretion of the prosecutor.
3. We have no occasion to enter upon the broad in-

quiry suggested by the argument as to the authority of
the Circuit Courts of Appeals to issue writs of prohibition.
We have no doubt of the power to issue the writ in the
case stated, and we need not discuss other cases supposed.
Prior to the application for a new trial in the District
Court, the defendant had sued out a writ of error and the
appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals
had attached. Brooks v. Norris, 11 How. 204, 207; In re
Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443, 456; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Phinney, 178 U. S. 327, 335; Old Nick Williams Co. v.
United States, 215 U. S. 541, 543. Basing the argument
upon the proposition that the Government had no right
of review in the Circuit Court of Appeals in a criminal
case, it is urged that the Government cannot be regarded
as deprived of any relief which it is entitled to seek from
that court, and hence that it cannot be said that the issue
of the writ was necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction.
Jud. Code, § 262. But the case was actually pending in
the Circuit Court of Appeals on the defendant's writ of
error, and the Government had all the rights of a litigant
in that court seeking to maintain a judgment assailed.
It is said that the defendant could have procured the dismissal of his writ, but in fact the writ had not been dismissed. It is said, also, that the consent to the hearing by
the District Court of the application for a new trial operated as a waiver of any rights the Government could have
in the Circuit Court of Appeals. This conclusion is sought
to be derived from the asserted efficacy of the consent
in the lower court, and, as we have seen, it had no efficacy
there, and it had no reference whatever to the proceedings
in the higher court. The defendant was still insisting
upon his rights as plaintiff in error in the Circuit Court
of Appeals, and the United States, as the opposing party
in that court, was entitled to its aid in order to preserve
the integrity of the record and to prevent unauthorized
action by the court below with respect to the judgment

was the appropriate remedy.
We answer question I-A in the affirmative, and questions
II and III in the negative. Question I-B involves an
inquiry not raised by the case made and is not answered.
It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. BARTLETT.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 251.

Argued October 22, 1914.-Decided November 16, 1914.

The act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, extending to April 26,
1931, the period of restriction upon the alienation of certain Indian
allotments, contained an excepting clause declaring that "nothing
herein shall be construed as imposing restrictions removed by or
under any prior law;" held that restrictions which had been terminated by lapse of time as contemplated by the law imposing them
were "removed from the land by or under" a prior law within the
meaning of the excepting .clause.
203 Fed. Rep. 410, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the act of
May 27, 1908, extending restrictions on alienation of Indian allotments, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, with whom
Mr. S. W. Williams was on the brief, for the United States:
By the act of May 27, 1908, Congress meant to provide
against the alienation, prior to April 26, 1931, of any
allotment then held by any member of any of the Five
Civilized. Tribes of full or three-quarters Indian blood,
