Syllabus.

International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, 257 U. S. 506, 514.
The original regulation as applied to a situation like that
under review is both inconsistent with the statute and
unreasonable.
The contention that the new regulation is retroactive
is without merit. Since the original regulation could not
be applied, the amended regulation in effect became the
primary and controlling rule in respect of the situation
presented. It pointed the way, for the first time, for
correctly applying the antecedent statute to a situation
which arose under the statute. See Titsworth v. Commissioner, 73 F. (2d) 385, 386. The statute defines the
rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which such
rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes
only a step in the administrative process. It does not,
and could not, alter the statute. It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determinati6n
construing and applying a statute to a cae in hand.
Judgment affirmed.

legal effect is the equivalent of intention or fraudulent purpose to
overvalue, and so to set at naught fundpmental principles that
safeguard the taxpayer's rights and property. P. 139.
4. An assessment of property for taxation is presumed to have been
rightly made on the basis of actual value. P. 139.
5. In apportioning value of an interstate railway system to a State
for taxation, there were used as factors the percentages in the State
(a) of total track mileage; (b) of physical property, measured by
cost of reproduction less depreciation; (c) of car and locomotive
miles, average of five years; and (d) of gross earnings, average for
five years, the amount of such earnings assigned to the State being
found by adding to the intrastate revenue earned in the State the
mileage proportion of revenue from traffic moving partly within
and partly outside of her boundaries. Though percentages thus
used were not higher than those submitted to the taxing board by
the Railway Company, the Company contended in this suit
that the apportionment operated to tax property outside of the
State. Held that, having regard to the size of the entire railway
system and the variety of things that affect values to be attributed
to its railroad in different States, and the numerous matters as to
which there may be wide difference of opinion, the use of the percentages was not shown to be confiscatory or arbitrary. P. 143.
6. In determining whether a tax assessment was arbitrarily made and
grossly excessive, the assessors may not be compelled to submit to
examination as to the operation of their minds in making it. P. 145.
7. Judicial notice must be taken of the fact that late in 1929 there
occurred a great collapse of values of all classes of property-railroads, other utilities, commodities and securities,--and that the depression then commenced pxogressively became greater. P. 149.
8. In assessing railroad property during the depression, a taxing board
was bound to take into account and give due weight to the sudden,
progressive and enormous declines of value. P. 149.
9. In a suit by an interstate railway company to enjoin in part the
collection of taxes levied on its property in North Dakota for the
year 1933, -the allegations and evidence on behalf of the state
authorities showed that for a series of years, including the depression years 1929-1932, the basis adopted by them and approved by
them as the best available for computing the value of the entire
railway system, was the five-year average value of the stocks and
bonds and capitalized income; that if this basis had been used in
1933, the system valuation for that year and the part of it assignable to and assessed in North Dakota would have been vastly less

than in 1932, owing to the effects of the economic depression upon
property values, prices and earnings; but that, -in assessing for
1933, they had arbitrarily repeated the assessment for 1932, without making a fresh computation of value or paying heed to economic changes. Resolving all doubts in favor of validity, the evidence conclusively showed that the challenged (1933) assessment
exceeded the true full value of the railway's property in North
Dakota in 1933 by $10,000,000. Held:.
(1) That the taxing board's failure to consider the enormous
diminution in value of the railway's property caused by the 1929
collapse and the progress of the depression, was equivalent in law
to intention to make the grossly excessive assessment, and deprived
the railway of rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 145, 151.
(2) The railway's right to relief was not prejudiced by overassessment and submission to overtaxation in any prior year. P. 152.

taxes.
Mr. F. G. Dorety, with whom Mr. C. J. Murphy was on

the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Harold D. Shaft, with whom Mr. P.

0. Sathre,

Attorney General of North Dakota, was on the brief, for

MR. JusTicE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This suit was brought in the federal district court for

North Dakota by petitioner against the state tax commissioner and the auditors and treasurers of 30 counties, to

enjoin collection of about 40% of 1933 taxes laid upon
its railroad properties in each county. The assessed value
of all petitioner's railroad property in the State is $78,-

832,888.

The total of the tax is $1,508,352.34, of which

petitioner has paid about 60%. The suit is grounded upon
the claim that the taxes are based on a valuation that

includes properties located outside the State and in other
respects are so excessive and arbitrary as to be repugnant
to the due process and equal protection clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment to, and the commerce clause of,
the Federal Constitution. Issues were joined, the case
was tried, the court made findings of fact, concluded that
petitioner was not entitled to relief and dismissed the bill.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 77 F. (2d) 405.
The state law requires that all property subject to
taxation be assessed at its true and full value in money.
Comp. Laws 1913, § 2122. The state board of equalization is required in August of each year to asses3 at its
actual value every railroad within the State and it is
governed by the rules that apply to township assessors
in valuing other property. § 2242. 1925 Supp., § 2141a3.
The average values per mile of main and branch lines,
respectively, constitute the bases for assignment of value
to counties. § 2243. And on like mileage bases the value
given to each county is distributed to its cities, towns,
townships and districts, through which the railroad extends. § 2244. The railroad property is taxed, as is
personal property, by applying the local rate to 50%
of the assessed value.1 Petitioner did not allege that
other property was not assessed at its full and true value
as required by state law, and does not seek relief on the
ground of discrimination.
Petitioner claims that the board made the assessment
by attributing to North Dakota too great a proportion of
a grossly excessive system valuation. More specifically
its contentibns are: (1) That, by reason of the methods
employed for the ascertainment of the percentage of system value to be assigned to North Dakota, the assessment

Opinion of the Court.

includes the value of property located in other States to
the extent of approximately $20,000,000, and (2) that,
even if the factors used to make the allocation be not
condemned, the assessment must nevertheless be held
arbitrary and excessive to the extent of $15,000,000.
The full and true value of the property is the amount
that the owner would be entitled to receive as just compensation upon a taking of that property by the State
or the United States in the exertion of the power *of
eminent domain. That value is the equivalent of the
property, in money paid at the time of the taking.
Olson v. United States, 292 U. S. 246, 254. The principles governing the ascertainment of value for the purposes of taxation, are the same as those that control in
condemnation cases, confiscation cases and generally in
controversies involving the ascertainment of just compensation. West v. C. & P. Telephone Co., 295 U. S. 662,
671.
In determining the amount of the assessment the board
was not bound by any formula, rule or method, but for
guidance to right judgment it was free to consider all
pertinent facts, estimates and forecasts and to give to
them such weight as reasonably they might be deemed
to have. Courts decline to disturb assessments for taxation unless shown clearly to transgress reasonable limits.
Overvaluation is not of itself sufficient to warrant injunction against any part of the taxes based on the challenged
assessment; mere error of judgment is not enough; there
must be something that in legal effect is the equivalent
of intention or fraudulent purpose to overvalue the property and so to set at naught fundamental principles that
safeguard the taxpayer's rights and property. Rowley
v. Chicago & N. W. Ry., 293 U. S. 102, 109-111. The
assessment is presumed to have been rightly made on the
basis of actual value. Its validity must be tested upon
consideration of the .facts established by the evidence
and of those of which judicial notice may be taken.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

There is controversy between the parties as to whether
the evidence discloses how the assessment was made.
Petitioner maintains that the record shows that the board
found system value And apportioned it to North Dakota
and also shows the methods by which these determinations were made. The aisttict court refused to find, and
the Circuit Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed
t6 prove, that the board made the valuation by methods
which petitioner claims that it employed.
1. As to methods employed by the board. Respondents called as a witness Mr. Lyman A. Baker, who had
been with the North Dakota tax commissioner for 19
years and during the last 13 years, ending January 1, 1933,
had been deputy commissioner in charge of the valuation
of railroads and other utilities. He was engaged in this
litigation in behalf of respondents and spent much time
in making computations and in the preparation of exhibits
that were put in evidence by respondents. In substance
he testified:
The first step in the valuation of railroad property
within a State is to determine the value of the entire
system. There are two classes of evidence ordinarily considered: The average market price of stock and bonds,
and the past earnings over a period of years. As the
stock and bond prices reflect value of the entire railroad,
it is necessary to eliminate the value of non-operating
property. The methpd requires a definite period over
which to average price quotations and that must of necessity be somewhat arbitrarily fixed. It assumes that the
average price reflects value, but rarely is controlling interest bought or sold on the exchange. Where control is
sought prices advance sharply. The method also assumes
that purchasers act on accurate knowledge of conditions;
it ignores the influence of pure speculation. In applying
the method, taxing boards, economists and railroad men
have always adopted five-year periods immediately pre-

GREAT NORWHERN RY. v. WEEKS.
135

Opinion of the Court.

ceding the assessment in order to give stability to the tax
value. The depression resulted in a collapse in the stock
and bond market. Forced selling brought prices down to
a figure that did not fairly represent the value of the
property. "Despite all these objections to the stock and
bond method of valuation, I still consider it as one of
the best indices of value obtainable."
He further testified: Capitalization of net railroad operating income is generally recognized as an important
element in estimating the value of railroad operating
property. The average net income, usually for five years,
is capitalized at a reasonable rate of return. The method
assumes the amount so ascertained to be the value of the
property. The income of a single year is seldom, if ever,
used. As 1931 and 1932 were the worst years in railroad
history since the panic of 1893, the use of the three-year
period ending in 1932 has but little justification. The
five-year period has been given the same weight by the
state board for a good many years. It is generally considered that the rate of return that a company is allowed
to earn under state and federal law is a fair rate to use.
A rate of six percent. is justifiable under present conditions. Economic return from farm property, being about
65% of all that is taxable in North Dakota., decreased
about 75% from the 1924-1928 average. Assessments on
values indicated by capitalization of average net income
for the five years ending in 1932 would result in giving
preferential treatment to railroads as compared with other
properties. Where properties have been operated at a
loss over a period of years, there are no earnings to capitalize. Yet they have present and prospective value
which would be reflected by use of the stock and bond
valuation method. The criticisms made of these methods
are not sufficient to render them valueless. "On the contrary the two methods are universally approved as the
two best evidences of the value of a railroad which are
available."

142

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U. S.

The answer alleges: In 1932 the tax commissioner made
and presented to the board computations based upon a
determination of system value by the use of a composite
of the average stock and bond values of the petitioiier for
a period of five years preceding the assessment and the
average value ascertained by capitalizing net earnings
for the same period; by apportioning the system value
to North Dakota upon the basis of the average of five
factors: (1) miles of all track, (2) physical property, (3)
car and locomotive miles, (4) ton and passenger miles,
(5) gross earnings, there was produced a value of $76,115,715; another apportionment on the basis of the three
use factors, viz. car and locomotive miles, ton and passenger miles, and gross earnings, produced $79,417,825,
and a third apportionment by the average of track miles
and the three use factors produced $80,671,790. The
answer further alleged that "upon this evidence and upon
all other evidence and matters of common knowledge before it the Board did in the year 1932 fix the valuation
of plaintiff's property in North Dakota at $78,850,024";
that in 1933 the commissioner and the railway company
presented to the board the financial and operating statistics of the plaintiff's railroad and reports and computations based upon the formulas used in 1932 and other
evidence of value, and that the board after full consideration of them and all other evidence of value and
matters of common knbwledge fixed the assessment for
1933 at $78,832,888 "which said amount represented the
honest judgment" of the board "and the full and true
value of the plaintiff's North Dakota property in money."
The average of the valuations computed for 1932 as
alleged in the answer is $78,735,110; the assessment was
$78,850,024. The difference is less than one-sixth of one
per cent. The trial court found that for 1933 the board
assessed the property at "the sum of $78,832,888, which
sum was the same as the 1932 assessment except for a

GREAT NORTHERN RY. v. WEEKS.
135

Opinion of the Court.

deduction of $17,136 for certain trackage of the plaintiff
which had been removed."
It is clear that the computations prepared by the tax
commissioner for the use of the board served as guides
to, if indeed they were not used as the measure of, value
for the assessments made by the board for 1932 and 1933.
Respondents' answer and evidence require a finding that
these computations were in fact the controlling bases and
constituted the very foundation of the 1932 and 1933
assessments. In view of the relatively small differences
between the 1933 assessment and the figures produced by
the methods approved by respondents and universally as
the best available evidence of value of a railroad, the latter rightly may be used in testing the validity of the
former.
2. Petitioner's claim that the board's apportionment of
system value to North Dakota operated to assess and tax
property in other States cannot be upheld.
Petitioner maintains that the amount attributed to
that State was found by the use of the factors above referred to. More fully described, they are: 1. Miles of
all track (as of December 31, 1931)-20.19%. 2. Physical property as measured by cost of reproduction less depreciation (as of December 31, 1931)-13.84%. 3. Car
and locomotive miles (average for five years ending with
1931)-19.90%. 4. Ton and passenger miles (average
for five years ending with 1931)-18.65%. 5. Gross
earnings (average for five years ending with 1931)18.45%; the amount assigned to North Dakota was found
by adding to the intrastate revenue earned in that State
its mileage proportion of revenue derived from traffic
moving partly within and partly outside her boundaries.
The average of these percentages is 18.206%.
The principal grounds on which petitioner assails the
board's apportionment are: Petitioner's railroad in North
Dakota consists largely of relatively cheaper branch lines.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

The most valuable terminals and costly construction are
in other States and, while these include little mileage,
they contribute as much to system value in proportion to
cost as do the cheaper stretches of the road where the
same investment is spread over much greater mileage.
The problem of apportionment is a difficult one. It is
impossible to formulate a rule generally applicable. Controlling conditions vary greatly from time to time. Allocations to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes
must be arrived at by the exercise of sound judgment
based on facts that fairly reflect the relation between
value of the system as a whole and value of the part
within -a State. Rowley v. Chicago & N. W. Ry., supra,
109, 110.
The methods proposed by petitioner discredit its objections to the apportionment made by the board. While
the board had the 1933 assessment under consideration,
petitioner submitted to it a brief in which it proposed two
methods of apportionment. One was by use of the above
described factors 1, 3, 4 and 5, and the other by use of
3, 4 and 5, producing, respectively, as calculated by petitioner, 19.35% and 19.14%. These percentages are
higher than the average of those that petitioner says the
board used. There is no evidence that the assessment
was arrived at by use of apportioning percentages higher
than those then used by petitioner.
Petitioner's bill suggests a method of apportionment
that would assign to North Dakota less than 12/2% of
system value. Briefly, the method is this: To the revenue derived from North Dakota intrastate traffic add a
part of the revenue received from the interstate moving
in Norfh Dakota that is equal to its proportion of the
property used in, and the cost of, carrying that traffic;
deduct the operating expenses incurred in moving it from
the total revenue. The relation of the state net earnings

GREAT NORTHERN RY. v. WEEKS.
135

Opinion of the Court.

so found to the net for the system will be the same as
that existing between North Dakota value and system
value. As petitioner gives this method scant, if any, support here and as it was- rejected by the lower courts, we
need not consider it. United States v. State Investment
Co., 264 U. S. 206, 211. Texas & N. 0. R. Co. v. Railway
Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 558. United States v. Commercial
Credit Co., 286 U. S. 63, 67.
And here petitioner argues that the apportionment
should be made on the basis of physical property, i. e.
factor 2 above described. That would assign to North
Dakota less than 15% of the system value. Petitioner
did not submit it to the board as the measure or even
include it in the group of factors upon which it based the
calculations included in its brief. It is not sustained by
evidence.
When regard is had to the size -of the Great Northern
system and the variety of things that affect values to be
attributed to its railroad in different States, and the numerous matters as to which there may be wide difference
of opinion, it must be held that percentages lower than,
or substantially the same as, those petitioner itself used
and submitted to the board are not confiscatory or arbitrary. Helvering v. Taylor, 293 U. S. 507, has no bearing.
3. There remains to consider whether the assessment
may be sustained against petitioner's claim that, assuming validity of apportionment, the valuation was arbitrarily made and is grossly excessive.
No testimony was given by the tax commissioner or
any other member of the board. They could not be compelled to submit to examination as to the operation of
their minds in making the challenged assessment. Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Babcock, 204 U. S. 585, 593.

ings of the lower courts, the evidence and the facts judicially known.
From the answer and evidence it unquestionably appears that the board valued petitioner's system and made
apportionment to North Dakota.. The assessments for
the years 1929-1933 are: $83,294,677, $83,294,688, $82,999,997, $78,850,024 and $78,832,888. The trial judge
found no overassessment for 1932 but refused to find the
value of the property in 1933 or whether the assessment
for that year was excessive; and he found that there is no
evidence, other than that offered to show overvaluation,
that the assessment was fraudulent or made with intent
to defraud petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals held
that petitioner failed to prove the method employed by
the board to make the assessment or that it was grossly
excessive and arbitrary.
Respondents' witness prepared tabulations which were
put in evidence as Exhibit P. It shows: 1. The value
for each year, based on averages for preceding five years,
from 1929 to 1933, inclusive, of the system operating
property as indicated by: (a) stock-and bond value less
value of non-operating property; (b) net operating income capitalized at six per cent; (c) the average of (a)
and (b). 2. Apportionment of system value to North
Dakota by percentages reflected by average of: (a) three
use factors, i. e. transportation service, traffic units and
gross operating revenue; (b) mileage of tracks operated
and the three use factors; (c) mileage of tracks owned
and operated and leased and operated and the three use
factors; (g) mileage of track operated, physical property
and the three use factors; (e) mileage of track operated,
physical property, the three use factors and net revenue.
3. Apportionment to North Dakota of: (a) stock and
bond value; (b) capitalized value; (c) average of (a)
and (b). 4. The North Dakota assessments. Ratio of

bond value; (b) capitalized value; (c) average of (a)
and (b). 2
The composite of the five year average of stock and
bond value and of net operating income capitalized for
1932 was $415,278,961; admittedly that was produced by
the use of the two methods shown by respondents' witness to be universally approved as the best methods for
finding system value. The 1932 assessment is 99.93% of
that figure apportioned on the basis of the three use facExhibit P need not be given in full. The following statement

basis of the stock and bond and capitalized income methods used for 1932, it would have been $345,188,820, about
83% of the corresponding figure for 1932, less than 76%
of like figures for 1931 and 1930 and about 79% of that
for 1929. See footnote 2. The 1933 assessment exceeds
what would have been made on system valuation based
on the five-year average of stock and bond values, apportioned by use of the five factors above described (advocated by the State as "the fairest basis of allocation") by
19.97%, exceeds that based on net "operating income capitalized by 29.44%, on! the composite of both by 24.52%.

Opinion of the Court.

been arrived at by any calculation based on the principles
and methods governing the tax commissioner in his computations submitted to the board through a period of
years and constituting the controlling bases of the assessments made by it. The five-year average of the composite of the stock and bond and capitalized income values,
held by all to be the best method, produced for 1932 a
valuation within one-sixth of one per cent. of the assessment for that year. The board arbitrarily adopted that
assessment, less value of a short stretch of track removed,
as the assessment for 1933. If the assessment for that
year had been based on the principles governing in 1932
and preceding years, it would have been less by about
$13,000,000 than the amount fixed by the board and here
in controversy.
The long period through which, even in 1933, the depression had extended compelled the conclusion that it
was not temporary. Judicial notice must be taken of the
fact that late in 1929 there occurred a great collapse of
values of all classes of property-railroads, other utilities,
commodities and securities, and that the depression then
commenced progressively became greater. In making
assessments in that period, the board was bound to take
into account and give due weight to the sudden, progressive and enormous declines of value.
Respondents' witness testified: The purchasing power
of money greatly increased and correspondingly values
decreased from 1929 to 1933. The Dow-Jones & Company average of 30 industrial stocks fell from 383.17 in
September, 1929, to 41.22 in July, 1932. The average
of 20 railroad stocks fell between the same dates from
189.11 to 13.23; total market value of all common and
preferred stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange
fell from eighty-nine and one-half billion to fifteen and
one-half billion dollars. Assessing officials and equalizing
boards were confronted with a very difficult situation

"Values which had been more or less stable for a generation have melted rapidly away. If all assessments had
been reduced to conform to actual market value, the
State and its subdivisions would have ceased to function,
as the revenue would not even approximate necessary
expenses."
Changed business conditions affecting petitioner's
traffic, coupled with competition from new methods of
transportation, precluded belief that prospective improvement in petitioner's business and earnings would within
a reasonable time, if ever, be sufficient to justify the
assessment in question. Cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v.
Walters, 294 U. S. 405, 423. But from 1929 to and
including 1933 the board reduced assessments of petitioner's North Dakota railroad properties by less than'six
per -cent. It is everywhere known that the general decline in values in that period was very much greater than
that. The evidence conclusively shows that the value of
petitioner's system and of its North Dakota railroad properties declined several times six per cent. Its traffic, gross
earnings and net income from operation fell off enormously.' The 1929 collapse and the decline progressively
following it resulted in' much lower levels of prices and
values which at least as early as 1933 were to be regarded

In cases such as this, courts are not permitted to weigh
evidence of value. They may not substitute their opinions for the findings of assessing officers or boards. But,
when the jurisdiction of the district court is appropriately
invoked, it is it duty to decide upon the merits of the
taxpayer's claim that the assessment of his property was
arbitrarily made and is grossly excessive. It clearly appears that the board failed to give reasonable weight to
the falling off of petitioner's traffic, gross earnings, operating income, the extraordinary shrinkage in values of
railroad properties, the prices of commodities and securities generally. The value of petitioner's property varied
with the profitableness of its use, present and prospective.

439, 445. Southern Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, 274 U. S. 76,

1929 in round figures $32,457,000; in the following years
$21,912,000, $12,669,000, $1,290,000. The board persistently disregarded known conditions essential to the just
ascertainment of value. While the vanishing of values
described by respondents' witness, the reduction of the tax
base from 75% to 50%, and the established limitations
upon rates of taxation, justify diligence on the part of the
assessing authorities that taxable property be assessed at
full value, neither these nor any other conditions warrant
or excuse arbitrary or excessive valuations.
The facts alleged in respondents' answer, and those
shown by the testimony of their witness and his computations above described, compel the conclusion that, by
reason of changed conditions affecting value, the methods
or system by which the board arrived at the 1933 value
of petitioner's railway as a whole were plainly calculated

to produce a grossly excessive assessment of its North
Dakota property for that year. That assessment being
shown to have been arbitrarily made and grossly excessive, petitioner's right to relief was not conditioned upon
overassessment or upon its submission to overtaxation in
1932 or any prior year. It follows that the lower courts
erred in holding that petitioner was not entitled to any
relief. The evidence persuasively supports petitioner's
claim that by reason of system overvaluation the North
Dakota assessment was too high by $15,000,000. And,
resolving all doubts in favor of validity, the evidence
must be held conclusively to show that the challenged
assessment exceeds the true and full value of petitioner's
North Dakota railroad properties in 1933 by $10,000,000.
See footnote 2. The board's failure to consider the enormous diminution in value of petitioner's property caused
by the 1929 collapse and the progress of the depression is,
within the principles of our decisions, the equivalent in
law of intention to make a grossly excessive assessment
for 1933 in disregard of petitioner's rights under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We need
not consider whether the assessment is repugnant to the
equal protection -or commerce clause. Unquestionably,
the assessment was made in plain violation of established
principles that govern property valuation. Fargo v.

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE, dissenting.

I think the judgment should be affirmed.
The decision of the Court turns on the constitutionality of the valuation, for 1933 taxation, of so much of
petitioner's railroad as is located, in'North Dakota.
The Court finds that the valuation of the railroad
within the state is not so disproportionate to the value
of petitioner's entire railroad system as to transcend due
process. See Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490, 500; compare
Rowley v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry., 293 U. S. 102,
109-111. It does not find, and there is no contention,
that there has been any discrimination in the valuation
of petitioner's property as compared with that of other
property in the state. Its decision that the tax is invalid
rests on the single ground that the valuation is excessive.
This conclusion is based on an elaborate examination
of the evidence produced before the trial court, evidence
which it is assumed affords the only basis for the valuation of the Board of Equalization. Emphasizing as the

on what it considers, for this purpose, a fair rate of
return the Court concludes that, as prices of securities
and earnings were much lower in 1933 than in 1932 and
earlier years, the valuation of the railroad property in
North Dakota for that year should have been correspondingly reduced. And because the decline in value found
by this formula is substantial, something like 20%, and
as the Board placed the same valuation on the property
in 1933 as in 1932, it is declared that the valuation is so
arbitrary as to make any tax based upon it a violation of
due process.
We may lay aside any consideration of the numerous
uncertain and imponderable elements involved in valuation of a railroad which may 'well make the use of such
a formula untrustworthy in times like the present, see
Rowley v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry., supra, 109;
which would seem to make it impossible for a court to
say that the 'rejection of the results of such a formula by
the taxing officials involved anything more than the
exercise 'of an authorized judgment, which courts cannot
pronounce arbitrary merely because it does not conform
to their own.
The feature-of the decision which is especially a matter
of concern is that for the first time this Court is setting
aside a tax as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
on the ground that the assessment on which it is computed
* is too high, without any showing that the assessment is
discriminatory or that petitioner is in any way bearing
an undue share of the tax burden imposed on all property
owners in the state.
Assessment for taxation is a quasi-judicial act and the
tax assessment has the quality of a judgment. Hagarv.

judicial officer, however gross, whether of law or of fact,
are not violations of the Constitution and are not open
to review in the federal courts merely because they are
errors. If overvaluation, even though gross or intentional,
were, without more, held to infringe the Fourteenth
Amendment, every taxpayer would be at liberty to ask
the federal courts to review a state tax assessment upon
the bare allegation that it is grossly excessive, and without
showing that it does more than subject him to taxation
on the same basis as every other taxpayer.
It has long been recognized that discrimination between
taxpayers, if intentional or so persistent as to be systematic, is a denial of equal protection, whether the discrimination is in the application of different rates to property in the same class or in inequality in its valuation.
Iowa-Des Moines Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S. 239, 245;
Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Review, 284 U. S. 23,
25ff; Chicago G. W. Ry. Co. v. Kendall, 266 U. S. 94, 98,
99; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, 260 U. S.
441, 445; Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., 207 U. S.
20, 37. But to hold that a tax is unconstitutional because
based upon an assessment which is too high, as compared
with the value of the same property for purposes of condemnation, overlooks the principle upon which property
taxes are laid and collected. Taxation is but a method
of raising revenue to defray the expenses of government,
and of distributing the burden among those who must
bear it. The taxpayer cannot complain of the tax burden
which he has to bear, who shows no inequality in the
application of it. And plainly he does not show inequality
merely by proving that the valuation of his property for
taxation is much higher than its market or its condemnation value.
The burden of a property tax like the present is distributed by applying a rate of tax to the assessed valua
tion of all taxable property. Variation of either, without

discriiniration, affects the amount of the tax but not the
equality olitdistribution. The activities and expenses
of government, over which the state has plenary control,
do not cease in time of depression. They may increase.
The state may meet those expenses by raising the valuation of taxable property, or by raising tax rates, or both,
without infringing any constitutional lhmunity. Here
the state, so far as appears, is raising the needed-,reyenue
and distributing the burden as in previous years, by'on;

tinuing old valuations. However high those valuations
may be, if not discriminatory, they impose no unequal
share of the tax burden on petitioner and cannot be said
to be arbitrary or oppressive in the constitutional sense.
Recently we held that a claim that the rate of a nondiscriminatory tax is e:icessively high presents no constitutiona4 l question. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S.
40, 44. No reason has been advanced at the bar, or
given in the opinion of the Court, why a tax valuation,
excessive when compared with condemnation or market
value, should have any different legal consequences. In
neither case is inequality of the tax burden established.
It is for that reason that this Court has held, without
exception, that valuation of property for tax purposes,
however excessive, not shown to be discriminatory,
infringes no constitutional immunity. Rowley v. Chicago
c N. W. Ry., supra, 111; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260
U. S. 519, 526; and see Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of

tax, because of its amount, may be burdensome, see Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, or because it is as high in a
