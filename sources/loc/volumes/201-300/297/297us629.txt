PHILLIPS PETROLEUM CO. v. JENKINS. 629

Syllabus.

court drew a sharp distinction between the excise tax
on the sale and that on the use of gasoline, holding the
first to be valid and the second to be repugnant to the
commerce clause of the federal Constitution as applied
to an interstate air carrier. Both cases definitely refused
to accept the view that the tax was a charge for the use
of the highways.
Appellants contend that the refund provisions of the
later 1931 statute, supra, nevertheless, demonstrate that
the state legislature intended that the excise tax now in
question should constitute compensation for the use of
the highways. But the so-called refund provisions apply
only in the case of taxes collected upon the purchase of
gasoline, not of taxes collected for its use. Moreover, the
state court in the Lujan case, p. 74, considered a like
contention and rejected it as without substance.
As applied to appellee, an interstate carrier doing no
intrastate business of any description, § 3 of the act,
which exacts license fees from distributors, is plainly invalid as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 58-59; International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91, 108-113.

V. JENKINS.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 386.

Argued February 7, 10, 1936.-Decided March 30, 1936.

1. Under its power to prescribe the provisions of charters of corporations organized under its.laws and to impose conditions for
the admission of foreign corporations to do local business, and
under power reserved in its constitution to amend corporate charters iand to impose like rules upon such foreign corporations, a
State may, consistently with the equal protection clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment, make corporations, foreign and domestic,
liable for personal injuries sustained by their employees through
negligence of fellow employees, while as to individual employers
it leaves in force the common-law fellow-servant rule. P. 633.
2. Section 7137, Crawford & Moses Digest of the Arkansas Statutes,
which abolishes the fellow-servant rule in suits against corporations,
is, as construed by the state supreme court, an exercise of the
power reserved by the state constitution to prescribe and alter the
terms of the charters of domestic corporations and to subject the
foreign corporations which are authorized to do business in the
State to the same regulations and liabilities as are imposed on
domestic corporations. P. 634.
3. Inasmuch as under the state constitution the power reserved to
amend a corporate charter can be exercised only when the General
Assembly is of opinion that the charter may be injurious to the
citizens of the State, and then only in such manner that no injustice shall be done to the corporators, the enactment of the above
mentioned statute necessarily implies legislative determinations in
accordance with those requirements; and in the absence of anything in the record, or of which judicial notice may be taken, to
negative these implied legislative conclusions or to show that the
distinction made by the statute between corporate and individual
employers is an arbitrary discrimination against corporations, it
will be assumed that conditions in Arkansas warrant that distinction. P. 636.

APPEAL from a judgment against the Petroleum Company and the surety on its supersedeas bond, based on a
verdict for damages in an action against the Company
for personal injuries sustained by one of its employees in
the course of his employment. A fellow-servant of the
plaintiff, whose negligence caused the injuries, was joined
as a defendant with the corporation.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Appellee sued the Phillips Petroleum Company and
J. H. Myers in an Arkansas court to recover damages for
injuries suffered by him while working for that company.
There was a trial by jury. It gave plaintiff a verdict in
accordance with which the court entered judgment
against both defendants for $50,000. On appeal to the
state supreme court, the guaranty company became
surety on a supersedeas bond. That court reduced the
judgment to $30,000 and held plaintiff entitled to recover that amount from the petroleum company and
the surety.
The petroleum company is a Delaware corporation
authorized to do business in Arkansas and engaged in
that State in the production and transportation of oil.
Crawford and Moses' Digest of the Arkansas Statutes,
§ 7137, enacted March 8, 1907, declares that all corporations shall be liable for injuries sustained by any employee resulting from negligence of any other employee.,
The Arkansas Constitution, Art. XII, § 6, provides:
"CorpQrations may be formed under general laws, which
"'Hereafter all railroad companies operating within this State,
whether incorporated or not, and all corporations of every kind
and character, and every company whether incorporated or not,
engaged in the mining of coal, who may employ agents, servants or
employees, such agents, servants or employees being in the exercise
of due care, shall be liable to respond in damages for injuries or
death sustained by any such agent, employee or servant, resulting
from the careless omission of duty or negligence of such employer,
or which may result from the carelessness, omission of duty or
negligence of any other agent, servant or employee of the said employer, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the carelessness, omission of duty or negligence causing the injury or death
was that of the employer."

laws may, from time to time, be altered or repealed. The
General Assembly shall have the power to alter, revoke
or annul any charter of incorporation now existing and
revocable at the adoption of this Constitution, or any
that may hereafter be created, whenever, in their opinion,
it may be injurious to the citizens of this State, in such
manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the
corporators." As to domestic corporations the supreme
court has repeatedly held § 7137 to be a reasonable exertion of the State's power to prescribe the terms of charters of corporations orgarfized under its laws.' The state
constitutibn authorizes admission of foreign corporations
to do business in the State and declares that, as to contracts made or business there done they shall be subject
to the same regulations and liabilities as like corporations
of that State. Art. XII, § 11. In this case the state
court, in harmony with earlier decisions,' held that § 7137
applies to a foreign corporation carrying on business in
Arkansas.
The substance of the cause of action, alleged is this:
April 5, 1934, plaintiff and Myers were fellow servants
-inthe service of the petroleum company., They and
other employees were engaged in laying pipe.' 'Plaintiff
was injured while he and Myers were carrying a length
of pipe. Plaintiff, his back toward Myers, had the forward end upon his shoulder; Myers had the other end'

Opinion of the Court.

and, while shifting the pipe from one shoulder to the
other, negligently jerked it and threw plaintiff to the
ground and injured him. The court charged tha , if
plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of
Myers, the verdict should be for plaintiff against both defendants. That instruction was in accordance with § 7137
and the verdict and judgment depend upon it. The sole
question is whether by that section the State denies to
the. petroleum company the equal protection of the laws
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Appellant does not suggest discrimination between
foreign and domestic corporations or between it and any
other corporation. The section by its terms extends to
all corporations whether organized in Arkansas or elsewhere. Undoubtedly the power of the State to prescribe
the rule of liability as one of the conditions for the admission of foreign corporations is not less than its power
to include the rule in the charters of domestic corporat.ions. Appellant's position is the same as, in like circumstances, would be that of an Arkansas corporation.
Its complaint is that the State makes corporations liable
for personal injuries sustained by an employee through
negligence of any other employee while as to individual
employers it leaves -in force the common law rule that
every servant assumes the risk of injuries through the
negligence of his fellow servants.
We shall first consider whether consistently with the
equal protection clause the State, by exertion of its
power to specify provisions of charters of corporations
organized under its laws and to impok conditions for
the admissi--n of foreign corporations, may prescribe the
challenged rule of liability. If, by specifying the terms
upon which corporations may be organized under its
laws or by the exertion of the reserved power to amend
qorporate charters, the State may impose the challenged

rule upon domestic corporations, then the petroleum
company is subject to the same rule. Arkansas Constitution, Art. XII, § 11. And, .as unquestionably power to
prescribe the terms of corporate charters is at least as
great as that reserved to change them, the validity of the
provision of § 7137 here in question may be tested as if,
by the use of reserved power to amend, it was added to
the charter of an Arkansas corporation.
Arkansas might have refrained from enactment of statutes creating or authorizing organization of corporations
and might have denied to foreign corporations admission
to the State. But it may not enforce any part of the
charter of a domestic corporation or any provision of its
laws relating to admission of a foreign corporation that is
repugnant to the Federal Constitution.' If § 7137 is repugnant to the equal protection clause, it is without force
as a part of the charter contract or otherwise.
The reservation of power to amend is a part of the
contract between the State and the corporation and
therefore § 10 of Art. I'of the Federal Constitution does
not apply. The reserved power is not unlimited and
cannot be exerted to defeat the purpose for which the
corporate powers were granted, or to take property without compensation, or arbitrarily to make alterations that
are inconsistent with the scope and object of the charter

or to destroy or impair any vested property right.' On
the other hand, it extends to any alteration or amendment "which will not defeat or substantially impair the
object of the grant, or any right vested under the grant,
and which the legislature may deem necessary to carry
into effect the purpose of the grant, or to protect the
rights of the public or of the corporation, its stockholders
or creditors, or to promote the due administration of its
affairs." ' As the State may not surrender or bind itself
not to exert its police power to guard the safety of workers, the common law fellow-servant rule may be abrogated by statute even when included in the charter of a
corporation.' But we accept the State's determination
that the provision of § 7137 here involved is a part of
the charters of corporations organized in Arkansas since
its enactment and that, through the power to alter or
amend, it is included in the charters of corporations
earlier organized under the laws of that State.
Essential to a just consideration of appellant's contention is a definite understanding of what is denied to it
by the construction put upon § 7137 by the state supreme
court. It was, as described by that court in an earlier
case, "the common-law rule that a servant assumes the

risk of negligence of his fellow servant." 8 That assumption, like the assumption of other risks incident to the
employee's work, is an implied one and constitutes a part
of the contract of employment. The section as construed
below operates merely to negative the implication, to
eliminate that term of the contract and, in its stead, to
insert in charters of corporations the rule that they shall
be liable for injuries suffered by an employee through
negligence of another employee. It merely substitutes
the rule of respondeat superior for the common law
fellow-servant rule.'
The power reserved by the state constitution to the
general 'assembly "to alter, revoke or annul" any charter
of incorporation is not a general authorization. Amendment may only be made whenever in the opinion of the
general assembly the charter "may be injurious to the
citizens of this State" and then only "in such manner,
however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators." The enactment of § 7137 necessarily implies
legislative determinations in accordance with these requirements. There is nothing in the record or of which
judicial notice may be taken to negative the conclusions
of the general assembly upon the matters specified or to
show that the distinction made by the statute is a groundless and arbitrary discrimination against corporations.
For aught that appears, conditions in Arkansas do not
warrant belief that enforcement of the common law
fellow-servant rule as to employees' claims for damages

on account of personal injuries suffered by them in the
service of employers other than those covered by § 7137
might be injurious to citizens of the State or that the
abrogation of the rule would not be unjust to that class
of employers. And justly, we think, it may be assumed
that, if in Arkansas there existed facts sufficient to constitute the specified bases for legislative action in accordance with the constitutional provision, the general
assembly would have abrogated the fellow-servant rule
and extqnded the one made by § 7137 to all employers.
It is therefore plain that the legislative determinations
required by the constitution and presumably made by the
general assembly adequately support the challenged
classification and that as construed by the state supreme
court in this case the statute is not repugnant to the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
We need not decide the question whether, independently of the reserved power to amend charters and of the
bases for legislative action upon which the state constitution conditions alterations, the provisions of § 7137
under consideration may be sustained as not repugnant
to the equal protection clause.
