DISMUKE v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

DISMUKE v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPFALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 199.

Arguea January 7, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.

1. The District Court has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act of a
claim to an annuity founded on § 8 (a) of the Civil Service Retirement Act of June 30, 1933. P. 169.
2. The declaration of that section that annuities shall be payable
from the retirement fund, which by an earlier Act is "appropriated
for the payment of annuities," amounts to no more than a direc-

tion that they shall be charged on the books of the Treasury to the
appropriation made for their payment. It does not impair or restrict the obligation to pay. Id.
3. Claims for annuities payable under the Retirement Act are not
claims for pensions or for salary or for compensation for services,
within' the meaning of the prohibition of the Tucker Act excluding
claims of those descriptions from the jurisdiction it confers upon
the District Courts. P. 170.
4. An administrative decision rejecting, on a pure question of law,
.a claim for an annuity under § 8 (a) of the Retirement Act, supra,
held open to review by the District Court in a suit by the claimant
under the Tucker Act. P. 171.
5. In creating claims against itself, the United States may limit claimants to an administrative remedy; but in the absence of compelling language, resort to the courts to assert the right created
will be deemed to be curtailed only so far as authority to decide
is given to the administrative officer; and, in the absence of plain
command the power of the officer will not be deemed to extend to
the denial of that which the statute allows as a right and to which,
upon the facts found or admitted by such officer, the claimant is
entitled. P. 172.
6. A field deputy United States marshal, during the period 1895-1902,
was not an employee of the United States within the meaning of
the Retirement Act, supra. P. 173.
76 F. (2d) 715, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 296 U. S. 554, to review the reversal of a
judgment recovered by Dismuke in the District Court in
a suit under the Tucker Act.

JUSTICE

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
About June 30, 1933, petitioner filed a claim with the
Administration of Veterans' Affairs for allowance of an
annuity under the provisions of § 8 (a) of the Civil Service Retirement Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 283, 305, 5
U. S. C., § 692d, which authorizes payment of annuities, at a specified rate, under circumstances not now
material, to retired government employees in the classified civil service who have rendered at least thirty years'
service. His claim was rejected by the Director of Insurance, on the ground that his employment as a field deputy
United States marshal from December 16, 1895 to April
30, 1902, which he had counted as a part of his thirty
years' service, could not be so included, because field
deputy marshals during that time were employees of the
marshal appointing them, and not of the United States.
Deducting this period, his total service was twenty-four
years, which, if established in accordance with the provisions of the Act, would entitle him to an annuity at a
lower rate, under § 7 of the Act of May 29, 1930, 46 Stat.
468, 474, 5 U. S. C., § 697a. On appeal the Board of
Veterans' Appeals denied petitioner's application for
the same reason.
In the present suit, brought in the district court under
the Tucker Act, to recover accrued installments of the
annuity -based on the thirty-year period of service, and

Opinion of the Court.

for a declaratory judgment establishing petitioner's right
to such annuity, the court gave judgment for petitioner.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,
76 F. (2d) 715, holding that the district court was without jurisdiction because the Retirement Act must be construed as committing the adjudication of claims under it
solely to administrative officers, to the exclusion of the
courts. This Court granted certiorari in view of the public importance of the questions involved.
(1) The government urges that the district court was
without jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The Tucker
Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505, as amended by § 24
of the Judicial Code, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1093, 28 U. S.
C., § 41, permitting suits against the United States, confers on the district courts jurisdiction "concurrent with
the bouK. of Claims of all claims not exceeding ten thousand dollars founded upon . . . any law of Congress or
upon any regulation of an executive department or upon
any contract, express, or implied, with the Government
of the United States ....
Section 8 (a) of the Retirement Act declares that,
under conditions specified, the employee "shall be entitled to an annuity payable from the civil-service retirement and disability fund." The provision is mandatory,
expressed in terms of the right of the employee, which is
inseparable from the correlative obligation of the employer, the United States. The present suit to recover
the annuity is thus upon a. claim "founded upon a law of
Congress" and is within the jurisdiction conferred upon
district courts, as are suits to recover sums of money
which administrative officers are directed by Act of Congress to "pay" or "repay." Medbury v. United States,
173 U. S. 492; McLean v. United States, 226 U. S. 374;
United States v. Hvoslef, 237 U. S. 1, and see United
States v. American Tobacco Co., 166 U. S. 468. The
declaration that the annuities are payable from the re-

tirement fund, which, by § 8 of the Act of May 22, 1920,
41 Stat. 618, is "appropriated for the payment of annuities," amounts to no more than a direction that they
shall be charged on the books of the Treasury to the
appropriation made for their payment. It does not
impair or restrict the obligation to pay.
The Tucker Act declares that it shall not be construed
as giving jurisdiction of "claims for pensions" or "of
cases brought to recover fees, salary or compensation
for services of officers' of the United States." The government argues that the present suit must be either the
one or the other. It does not press the contention that
the annuities are "salary or compensation," which we
think without merit, see Retirement Board v. McGovern,
316 Pa. 161; 174 Atl. 400, but it insists that the suit is
brought to recover a pension. The proviso withholding
jurisdiction of suits on claims for pensions was a part of
the original Tucker Act, which became law March 3,
1887, long befoie the enactment of the Retirement Act
of May 22, 1920, and at a time when the term "pensions"
commonly referred to the gratuities paid by the government in recognition of past servicesin the Army or Navy.
The annuities payable under the Retirement Act are not
gratuities in that sense. The annuitant contributes to
them by deductions from his salary or by actual payments into the fund, as in the present case, and the
scheme of the Act is to provide for payment of annuities,
in part at least from contributions by employees, in
recognition both of their past services and of services to
be performed.
The Act itself, in contradistinction to the numerous
pension acts, see 38 U. S. C., does not refer to the annuities as pensions, and expressly excludes from the service
to be counted, in determining the class to which the annuitant is to be assigned, the period for which the
employee "elects to receive a pension under any law
." § 3, Act of May 22, 1920, 41 Stat. 615. 5 U. S. C.,

DISMUKE v. UNITED STATES.
167

Opinion of the Court.

§ 707. We conclude that annuities payable under the
Retirement Act are not pensions within the meaning of
the Tucker Act and that suits against the government to
recover them are within the jurisdiction of district courts,
if not precluded, as the court below held they are, by the
administrative provisions of the Retirement Act.
(2) Although the Retirement Act does not, in terms,
forbid employees to assert in the courts rights acquired
under it, the government insists that such restriction is
to be implied from the administrative provisions of the
Act. It points to the authority given the Commissioner
of Pensions,' under direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to make rules and reguations for carrying the act
into effect, § 17 of the Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 478, 5 U. S.
C., § 707a, and to § 13 of the same Act, 5 U. .S. C.,
§ 703a, which prescribes the form of application for the
annuity, the character of evidence to be presented in its
support, and declares that upon receipt of satisfactory
evidence the Commissioner of Pensions' shall forthwith
adjudicate the claim of the applicant," and finally to -the
administrative appeals authorized by § 17. From this
it is argued that the prescribed application to the Commissioner, his adjudication, and the appeal from his decision to departmental officials, afford an exclusive remedy
which precludes any resort to the courts for the recovery
of the annuity.
The United States is not, by the creation of claims
against itself, bound to provide a remedy in the courts.
'By Executive Order dated July 21, 1930, under § 1 of Act of July
3, 1930, 46 Stat. 1016, the functions of the Bureau of Pensions were
transferred to the Veterans' Administration. By Executive Orders
Nos. 6670 and 6731, dated respectively April 7, 1934, and June 5,
1934, under § 16 of Act of March 3, 1933, 47 Stat. 1517, and Order
of the Civil Service Commission dated August 24, 1934, the administration of the Civil Service Retirement Act was transferred from the
Veterans' Administration to the Civil Service Commission, effective
as of September 1, 1934.

It may withhold all remedy or it may provide an administrative remedy and make it exclusive, however mistaken
its exercise. See United States v. Babcock, 250 U. S. 328.
But, in the absence of compelling language, resort to the
courts to assert a right which the statute creates will be
deemed to be curtailed only so far as authority to decide
is given to the administrative officer. If the statutory
benefit is to be allowed only in his discretion, the courts
will not substitute their discretion for his. Williamsport
Wire Rope Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 551; United
States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 249 U. S. 451, 454;
Ness v. Fisher, 223 U. S. 683. If he is authorized to determine questions of fact his decision must be accepted
unless he exceeds his authority by making a determination which is arbitrary or capricious or unsupported by
evidence, see Silberschein v. United States, 266 U. S. 221,
225; United States v. Williams, 278 U. S. 255, 257, 258;
Meadows v. United States, 281 U. S. 271, 274; Degge v.
Hitchcock, 229 U. S. 162, 171; or by failing to follow a
procedure which satisfies elementary standards of fairness and reasonableness essential to the due conduct of
the proceeding which Congress has- authorized, Lloyd
Sabaudo Societa v. Elting, 287 U. S. 329, 330, 331. But
the power of the administrative officer will not, in.the absence of a plain command, be deemed to extend t(o the
denial of a right which the statute creates, and to which
the claimant, upon facts found or admitted by the administrative officer, is entitled. United States v. Laughlin,
249 U. S. 440, 443; United, States v. Hvoslef, supra;
McLean v. United States, supra, 378; Parish v. MacVeagh, 214 U. S. 124; Medbury v. United States, supra,
497 f98; see Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, 194 U. S. 106,
1o9, 110.

The Commissioner is required by § 13, "upon receipt
of satisfactory evidence" of the character specified, "to
adjudicate the claim." This does not authorize denial of

DISMUKE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

a claim if the undisputed facts establish its validity as a
matter of law, or preclude the courts from ascertaining
whether the conceded facts do so establish it. The decisions of the Director of Insurance and the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and the stipulation of facts upon which
the case was tried, show that the petitioner's claim for
an annuity based on thirty years' service was rejected on
the sole ground that his employment as a field deputy
United States marshal could not be counted as service as
an employee of the United States. The administrative
decision thus turned upon a question of law, whether a
field deputy marshal during the period from December 16,
1895 to December 30, 1902, was an employee of the
United States. The administrative determination of
that question is open to review in the present suit, and
should have been considered and decided by the court
below.
(3) We are of the opinion that a field deputy United
States marshal from 1895 to 1902 was not an employee
of the United States within the meaning of the Retirement Act. Before the Act of May 28, 1896, c. 252, 29
Stat. 140, 181, United States marshals were authorized
to appoint deputy marshals, removable from office by the
district judge or by the circuit court, R. S. § 780, who
were to be paid a "proper" allowance, not to exceed
three-fourths of the fees earned by them. R. S. § 841.
Sections 9 and 10 of the Act of 1896 placed the marshal
and office deputy marshals upon a salary basis, but § 11
authorized the marshal to appoint field deputy marshals
to hold office during his pleasure unless sooner removed
by the district courts, who should receive as compensation three-fourths of the fees, including mileage, earned
by them. The status of a field deputy marshal under
this legislation was therefore the same as that of all
deputy marshals under the earlier Act. We regard the
question whether such a field deputy marshal was an

employee of the government or of the marshal as settled
by the decision and reasoning of this Court in Douglas
v. Wallace, 161 U. S. 346, which held that, in view of
the manner of a deputy marshal's appointment and payment, his claim for compensation had the status of that.
of a claim of an employee of the marshal, not of the government, and so was not affected by R. S., § 3477, declaring void any assignment of any interest in a claim against
the United States. To the same effect are United States
v. McDonald, 72 Fed. 899, 900; Powell v. UnitedStates, 60
Fed. 687; Wintermute v. Smith, 30 Fed. Cas. No. 17,897.
This has been the administrative ruling since 1920,
see Claim of George Taylor Larkin, recorded in 21 P. &
R. D. 42. A construction of such long standing is not
lightly to be overturned. See United States v. Moore,
95 U. S. 760, 763; Logan v. Davis, 233 U. S. 613, 627;
Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U. S.273; Brewster v. Gage, 280
U. S. 327, 336; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States,
282 U. S. 375; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 287 U. S. 178; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 288 U. S. 294, 315.
Later legislation providing for payment of annuities to
employees of the United States must be taken to have
been adopted in the light of it.
Since the record does not disclose any administrative
determination of petitioner's right to an annuity computed on the basis of twenty-four years service, the sole
issue now presented is whether the decision that he was
not entitled to the annuity calculated on the basis of
thirty years' service was erroneous. The judgment of
the court below must therefore be affirmed, but for reasons stated in this opinion and not those stated in the
opinion of the court below.
Affirmed.
