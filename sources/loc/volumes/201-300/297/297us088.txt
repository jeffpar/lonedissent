concern of any one of the three branches of government,
or that it alone can save them from destruction is far
more likely, in the long run, "to obliterate the constituent
members" of "an indestructible union of indestructible
states" than the frank recognition that language, even
of a constitution, may mean what it says: that the power
to tax and spend includes the power to relieve a nationwide economic maladjustment by conditional gifts of

UNITED STATES v. SAFETY CAR HEATING &
LIGHTING CO.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 75.

Argued December 20, 1935.-Decided January 6, 1936.

A patent-owner began suit in 1912 to restrain infringements and for
damages and profits. The litigation was pending on February 25,
1913, the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment, and March 1,

1913, the effective date of the first statute enacted under it, and
was continued for many years thereafter during which the patentowner obtained a decree finally sustaining the patent followed by
a decree on accounting, of which a definite part was for profits
'receied by the infringer before March 1, 1913, and the remainder
for profits received thereafter, the claim for .damages having been
waived. Pending an appeal by the infringer involving the extent
of his liability, a compromise occurred (1925) in which the patentowner accepted a smaller amount in satisfaction of the judgment.
Held:
1. The profits thus received accrued to the patent-owner and
became taxable as his income, at the time of the settlement and
liquidation. P. 93.

Statement of the Case.

2. There is no ground for treating the profits from the infringements committed prior to March 1, 1913, as having accrued
to the patent-owner before that date and as being therefore excepted
from taxation by the Act of October 3, 1913 and later Revenue
Acts. P. 94.
3. The Treasury Regulation classifying claims that existed unconditionally on March 1, 1913, as nontaxable income, "although
actually recovered or received subsequent to that date," was impliedly ratified by Congress by the passage of Revenue Acts
without sign of disapproval. P. 94.
4. This regulation implies that conditional or contingent claims,
though they may have had an inchoate existence before March 1,
1913, are to be taxed when they become unconditional. P. 95.
5. A claim of a patent-owner to profits received by an infringer, while its validity and amount remain uncertain, is not
property transmuted into capital, but rather is contingent income.
P. 96.
6. The claim of a patent-owner against an infringer for damages, like a claim for the infringer's profits, is too contingent and
uncertain to have a determinable market value while the validity
of the patent is unsettled and contested and while the factors of
damage are conjectural. P. 97.
7. The claim in this case cannot be treated as one for damages,
since the taxpayer abandoned his claim against, the infringer for
damages and recovered profits. P. 97.
8. This case must be distinguished from one where the basis of
the claim is an injury to capital, with the result that the recovery
is never income, no matter when collected. P. 98.
9. Congress has power to tax income which accrued after the
adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment through the liquidation and
settlement of a claim which was inchoate, but remained uncertain
and contested, before the effective date of the Amendment. P. 98.
10. The acceptance in settlement of less than the claim involves
no loss deductible by the taxpayer, where from its origin up to the
time of settlement the claim was uncertain and contested. P. 99.
76 F. (2d) 133, reversed.

The respondent claims a refund of income taxes under
the Revenue Act of 1926. The petitioner in one of the
cases (No. 75) is the United States, a defendant in the
court below. The petitioner in the other (No. 76) is the
Collector of Internal Revenue for the Fifth District of
New Jersey.
Since 1907, the taxpayer, respondent, has been the
owner of the Creveling patent for an improvement in the
electric lighting equipment of railway passenger cars. It
brought suit in 1912 against the United States Light &
Heating Company to restrain an infringement of the
patent, and for an accounting of damages and profits.
The suit was pending on February 25, 1913, the effective
date of the Sixteenth Amendment, and on March 1, 1913,

fringement as well as its liability for damages and profits.
Not till 1915 was the capital fact of an infringement determined. On February 15, 1915, there was entered in
the District Court an interlocutory decree for an injunction, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals
in July of the same year. An accounting followed before
a Master and continued for eight years. On that accounting the complainant waived any recovery for damages,
and confined its claim to the profits received by the infringer. On May 26, 1923, the Master filed his report in
which he found that there was due to the complainant for
profits received by the infringer between January 1, 1909
and April 30, 1914, the sum of $501,180.32. Of this
award, a large part ($436,137.41) was for profits applicable to the period before March 1, 1913. The report was
confirmed by the District Court on October 10, 1923, at
which time the infringing defendant was in the hands of
receivers A final decree followed in October, 1924, the
award being adjudged to constitute a superior lien upon
the assets of the infringer then held by a successor. Crossappeals were carried to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the complainant contending that the award
was too small, the infringer and its successor contending
that the award was too large and that error had been
committed also in the declaration of the lien. While the
appeals were undetermined, the complainant accepted a
settlement in May, 1925, after thirteen years of litigation,
whereby it received from the infringer the sum of $200,000 in satisfaction of the judgment. After deducting the
expenses incurred in connection with the suit ($23,468.05), the net amount collected was $176,531.95, of
which part ($153,621.72) is attributable to acts of infringement before March 1, 1913, and part to such acts
thereafter.
In May, 1926, the taxpayer filed its income tax return
for 1925, showing a net income for that year of $1,473,-

297 U.S.

187.13, and a tax due thereon of $172,610.19, which has
been paid. It did not include in the return any part of
the proceeds of the patent litigation ($176,531.95), nor
did it claim any deduction for loss resulting from the settlement. Thereupon the Commissioner made a deficiency
determination of $22,162.07, plus interest, the additional
tax due after adding the net proceeds of the settlement
to the income of the year. Two claims for refund followed. The first, filed in March, 1929, was for $69,729.18.
The 'taxpayer took the ground that as a result of the settlement it had sustained a loss of $536,378.28, which
through error it had failed to deduct in making its return
and in paying the tax thereunder. Its books were kept
on the accrual basis. The second of the two claims, filed
in July, 1930, was for an additional refund in the amount
of $19,970.82. In this the taxpayer took the ground that
in determining the gross income for 1925 the Commissioner had erred by including that part of the proceeds
of the settlement attributable to acts of infringement before March, 1913. Both claims were rejected by the Commissioner. The taxpayer then sued, making the United
States the defendant with reference to the first claim and
the Collector the defendant with reference to the second.
In the suit against the United States the District Court
found that the taxpayer's claim for damages on account
of so much of the infringement as had occurred before
March 1, 1913, had a "market value" on that date of
$436,137.41, the profits of the infringer up to that time
as reported by the Master. From this the court concluded
that in the year 1925 there had been a deductible loss of
The difference between $436,137.41 and the sum of $174,040.62, a like proportion of the $200,000 actually recovered. The tax upon this difference ($262,096.79) was
$34,072.58. The taxpayer received an award of judgment
for that amount with interest. 5 F. Supp. 276. In the
suit against the Collector, the District Court held that

U. S. v. SAFETY CAR HEATING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

such portion of the net settlement as was, allocable to acts
of infringement before March 1, 1913 ($153,621.72), had
accrued to the taxpayer in advance of that date, and was
therefore to be treated as capital, not taxable as income
for the year when the settlement was made. The taxpayer
received an award of judgment for the tax on that amount
(i. e., for $24,732.90) with interest.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
affirmed the judgments in both suits. 76 F. (2d) 133. To
fix more precisely the taxable quality of contested and
contingent choses in action belonging to a taxpayer before March 1, 1913, writs of certiorari issued from this
court.
First. Congress intended, with exceptions not now important, to lay a tax upon the proceeds of claims or choses
in action for the recovery of profits, unless the right to
such recovery existed unconditionally on March 1, 1913,
the effective date of the first statute under the Sixteenth
Amendrient.
The tax imposed on the respondent was laid under the
Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9), which includes
in gross income (§ 213 (a)) gains on profits "from any
source whatever." We have said of that Act that it reveals in its provisions an intention on the part of Congress to reach "pretty much every sort of income subject to the federal power." Helvering- v. Stockholms
Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S.84, 89. There is no denial that
profits owing to a patentee by the infringer of a patent
are income within the meaning of the statute, unless
withdrawn from that category by the date of the infringement. Cf. T. R. 45, Art. 52; T. R. 62, Art. 51; T. R. 65,
Art. 50; T. R. 69, Art. 50; Commissioner v. S. A. Woods
Machine Co., 57 F. (2d) 635.
Until July, 1915, the existence of any liability was
contested and uncertain. The amount remained contested and uncertain until May, 1925, when there was a

297 U.S.

settlement of the liability reported by the Master. Then
for the first time the profits flowing from the infringement became taxable as income. North American Oil
Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417, 423; Lucas v.
American Code Co., 280 U. S. 445, 451, 452; Lucas v.
North Texas Lumber Co., 281 U. S. 11; Burnet v. Huff,
288 U. S. 156. The respondent admits this to be true
to the extent that the acts of infringement were later
than February, 1913. The argument seems to be, however, that accrual has a different meaning when applied
to income generated by acts committed earlier. But
plainly the respondent's exemption, if it exists, will have
to rest upon some other basis. A claim for profits so
contingent and indefinite as to lack the quality of accrued income in March, 1913, cannot have had th6 quality of such income before that time, its existence and
extent being then equally uncertain. Only an arbitrary
dichotomy could bring us to the conclusion that part of
the recovery was income to the taxpayer as of the date of
payment or collection and part as of the date of the
underlying wrong. The respondent, to prevail, must be
able to make out that though the profits were income in
their entirety as of May, 1925, there was an intention of
the Congress that part of this income, the part attributable to acts before March, 1913, should be excluded from
the reckoning.
We find no disclosure of that intention in the provisions
of the statute, and none in the history of other acts before it. The first statute following the Sixteenth Amendment laid a tax, as we have seen, on the entire net income
"accrued" within each calendar year, the impost being
coupled with a proviso that for the year 1913 what was to
be taxed should be the entire net income "accrued" within that portion of the year from March 1 to the end. Definiteness of meaning was given to that and later acts by
Treasury Regulations. Article 90 of Regulations 62,

U. S. v. SAFETY CAR HEATING CO.
88

Opinion of the Court.

adopted in 1922, provides: "Any claim existing unconditionally on March 1, 1913, whether presently payable or
not, and held by a taxpayer prior to March 1, 1913,
whether evidenced by writing or not" does "not constitute taxable income, although actually recovered or received subsequent to such date." This provision appears
without change of form in all Treasury Regulations
adopted since that time. T. R. 65, Art. 90; T. R. 69, Art.
90; T. R. 74, Art. 91; T. R. 77, Art. 90. It appears
with unimportant verbal differences in earlier regulations,
T. R. 45, Art. 87, as amended by T. D. 3206, 5 Cum. Bul.
116. A claim existing "unconditionally" would include a
claim for interest on a bond or for rent under a lease. A
claim existing conditionally can have no better illustration
than is found in a claim to recover an infringer's profits.
Cf. 0. D. 917, 4 Cum. Bul. 142; 0. D. 1141, 5 Cum. Bul.
134; S. M. 2285, 111-2 Cum. Bul. 87, 89, 90, disapproving
I. T. 1294, I-1 Cum. Bul. 111. Nor does the case for the
Government stand upon the regulations alone without
confirmatory evidence. By clear implication the regulations hhve been ratified by Congress, which has passed
Revenue Acts at frequent intervals thereafter without a
sign of disapproval. " Congress must be taken to have
been familiar with the existing administrative interpretation." McFeely v. Commissioner, 296 U. S. 102; Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, 293 U. S. 172, 179, 180..
Claims existing unconditionally before March 1, 1913, being thus excluded from the tax, the plain meaning of the
regulation is that conditional or contingent claims, though
they may have had an inchoate existence before March 1,
1913, are to be taxed when they are shorn of their conditional or contingent quality and become unconditional or
absolute. So far as the problem to be solved depends upon
the intention of the Congress in the enactment of the statute, the result is hardly doubtful.

96

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U. S.

Whatever obscurity exists has its origin, one may believe, in a not uncommon confusion of the rule with the
exception. There is a tendency now and again to look
upon March 1, 1913 as fixing a point of time when claims
of every kind, no matter how contingent, became transmuted into capital, at least for taxing purposes. This is
far from the truth, as the acceptance by Congress of the
foregoing regulations sufficiently attests. The intention
has rather been that, with e5cceptions specially declared
or dependent upon considerations of established methods
of accounting, every form of income accruing fully or unconditionally after February, 1913, shall contribute to the
Treasury, though it had a potential existence for years
before its capacity to fructify. As already suggested, perception of this intention has been clouded by .exceptions,
actual or seeming, which have been so insulated and emphasized as to be taken for the rule itself. Thus, Congress
has now provided (see, e. g., Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463,
§ 2 (a), 39 Stat. 756, 757; Revenue Act of 1921, c. 135,
§ 201, 42 Stat. 224, 228; Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, § 201,
44 Stat. 9, 10) that dividends may be distributed exempt
from the tax to the extent that they are made out of
earnings or profits accumulated before March 1, 1913.
The exemption is "a concession to the equity of stockholders" (Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339, 346; Helvering
v. Canfield, 291 U. S. 163, 167), and had no existence under the pioneer statute, the Act of 1913, a dividend, irrespective of its source, being then taxable altogether.
Lynch v. Hornby, supra. So Congress has now provided
(see e. g., Revenue Act of 1924, c. 232, 43 Stat. 253, 259,
§ 204 (11) (b); supra, § 204 (b); Revenue Act of 1926,
supra, § 204 (b)) that in computing gain or loss from the
sWle or other disposition of property acquired before
March 1, 1913, the base shall be the cost or the value on
that day, whichever is the greater. See also, Revenue
Act of 1916, supra, § 2 (c); Revenue Act of 1921, supra,

U. S. v. SAFETY CAR HEATING CO.
88

Opinion of the Court.

§ 202 (b) (1). Cf. Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka,
255 U. S. 509; Goodrich'v. Edwards, 255 U. S. 527. We
are not unmindful of cases in which a like formula was
applied without the aid of statute. Lynch v. Turrish, 247
U. S. 221; Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179;
Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189; and
cf. MacLaughlin v. Alliance Insurance Co., 286 U. S. 244,
251. They do not rule the case at hand. In those cases
and others like them assets that were capital in February,
1913, had been converted into cash thereafter. Coal lands
and timber lands and timber had been sold by an owner
in the ordinary course of business. By the practice of
merchants a stock in trade is capital according to its inventory value. Hays v. Gauley Mt. Coal Co., supra, at
p. 193. Nothing of the kind is here. The case is not
helped by speaking of the claim as "property."
The
question is whether it is property that has been transmuted into capital. In February, 1913, the chose in action
now assessed was not a part of the respondent's capital as
merchants or other business men would understand the
term. Cf. North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet,
supra. At best it was contingent income, the income of
the future. It had no inventory value, much less a valur
quoted in the market. Whether it would ever be worth
anything was still unknown and unknowable. The answer
was not given for man3 years thereafter.
The argument is pressed upon us that the claim collected by the respondent is to be viewed as one for danages rather than as one for profits, and that in the aspect
of a claim for damages it had a "market value" ascertainable at the commencement of the suit and later. There
are two reasons, if not more, why the argument must fail.
In the first place, the respondent made an election to
abandon any claim for damages and to confine itself to
the profits received by the infringer. The amount of
these profits was unknown at the commencement of the

98

Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

suit and must needs have remained unknown in advance
of an accounting. To determind what the respondent got
we are to consider what it did, and not what it could have
had if it had made another choice. In the second place,
a claim for damages like one for an infringer's profits is
too contingent and uncertain to have a determinable market value when the validity of the patent is unsettled and
contested and the factors making up the damage arc
arrived at by conjecture. SinclairRefining Co. v. Jenkins
Petroleum Co., 289 V. S. 689, 697. Cf. Heiner v. Crosby,
24 F. (2d) 191; Walter v. Duffy, 287 Fed. 41. There is
significance in the fact that the estimate of the damage
in the claim filed with the Commissioner exceeded by
nearly $300,000 the estimate of the damage accepted at
the trial.
,The case comes down to this: On February 29, 1913,
the respondent had a contested claim for profits which if
prosecuted effectively would ripen into income. That
claim would not have been capital, if it had been acquired
for the first time on March 1, 1913. It was not turned
into capital because it had been acquired earlier. Edwards
v. Keith, 224 Fed. 585; 231 Fed. 110; Workman v. Commissioner, 41 F. (2d) 139. Before March 1, 1913, and
afterwards, it was continuously the same thing until reduced to judgment and collected. The case is not to be
confused with one where the basis of the suit is an injury
to capital, with the result that the recovery is never income, no matter when collected. Examples of such a
claim are Saunders v. Commissioner, 29 F. (2d) 834, and
Heiner v. Hewes, 30 F. (2d) 787, cited by the taxpayer.
Buffalo Union Furnace Co. v. Helvering, 72 F. (2d) 399,
is perhaps upon the border line, the claim being not for
profits, but for recovery of out of pocket expenses. Confining it to its peculiar facts, we do not read it as inconsistent with the views herein expressed.
Second. Congress was not restraiixtd by express or imnlied restrictions of the Federal Constitution from giving

U. S. v. SAFETY CAR HEATING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

effect to its intention and levying a tax upon the proceeds
of the settlement.
In February, 1913, if our analysis of the facts is accurate, there was a contested and contingent claim for
profits, not fairly to be characterized as income for that
year or earlier. In 1925, this inchoate and disputed claim
became consummate and established. It was now something more than a claim. It was income fully accrued,
and taxable as such. Till then the patentee had its
capital, the patent, and an expectancy of income, or income, more accurately, in the process of becoming.
Thereafter it had something different. No doubt the income thus accrued derived sustenance and value from
the soil of past events. We do not identify the seed with
the fruit that it will yield.
Income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment is the fruit that is born of capital, not the potency
of fruition. With few exceptions, if any, it is income as
the word is known in the common speech of men. Lynch
v. Hornby, supra, p. 344. When it is that, it may be
taxed, though it was in the making long before. MacLaughlin v. Alliance Ins. Co., supra, at pp. 249, 250;
Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470; Helvering v. Canfield,
supra. Cf. Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S. 573, 577, 578;
Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418; Eisner v. Macomber,
252 U. S. 189, 206, 207. If exceptions are to be allowed
in exceptional conditions, they are inapplicable here.
Third. The taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction on
the basis of a difference between the value of the chose
in action on March 1, 1913, or at any other time and the
proceeds of collection.
(a) At the time of the settlement, the amount of the
infringer's liability was contested af it had been before,
the outcome of the contest being uncertain as long as the
appeal was pending.. The respondent chose to forego a
large portion of the judgment in the belief that corn-

297 U. S.

promise was prudent. For all that appears, if compromise had been rejected, the judgment would have been
9 reduaed,'as to qnake1 the recovery even, less True the
respondent insists that the fear of a reductidn was not
the- motive for ,the settlement.. The motive is ;&aid to
have been the fear that the judgment, even-if nodmlqcd,
might not be susceptible of collection.-, On Aeq her
hand, the infringer may have viewed tje prospe.eOf
ferently. We have no means of ascertaining~whosefore:
cast was the better. What we know is that there was
a compromise through which patentee and infringer surendered rights and opportunities.
(b) The value of the chose in action, uncertain at the
time of settlement, was even more uncertain in February,
1913. Unpredictable vicissitudes might reduce it to a
nullity. The patent might be adjudged invalid. The infringer might become insolvent. In the earlier years as in
the later ones the supposed profits of the business might
have evaporated as the result of neglect or incapacity.
Not till the report by the Master and its confirmation by
the court could the recovery be estimated with even
approximate correctness. There is no contention by the
respondent that the value of the judgment was greater
at that time than it was a few months later at the date of
the settlement in the face of an appeal.
The conclusion is inescapable that the acceptance of
the settlement did not involve a loss of income, still less
a loss of capital.
Fourth. The taxpayer is not entitled to a refund of the
proportion of the settlement attributable to the profits of
the infringer before the effective date of the Sixteenth
Amendment.
This conclusion follows without need for elaboration
from what has been said in this opinion as to the distinction between capital and income.
The judgments are
Reversed.

Syllabus.

-MR. JUSTICE BuTLER, and
MR. JuSTIcE SuTHEF
ixD,
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgments
should be affirmed. The claim of respondent was a valid
one, constituting property prior to March 1, 1913. It not
only had an ascertainable value at that time, but a value
which was actually ascertained and found as a fact by the
trial judge and affirmed by the court below. Since there
is evidence in the record to support these concurrent findings, we are not at liberty to set them aside. The case
clearly falls within the principle of Doyle v. Mitchell
Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179; Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S.
573, and other cases which might be cited. Certainly
promissory notes, bonds, shares of stock and valid claims
arising upon contract or in tort may be capital as distinguished from income, quite as much as a stock of goods
or other tangible property. And quite as certainly, it is
not necessary that these intangibles should have a market value or an inventory value. It is enough that they
have an ascertainable value at the statutory time fixed.
