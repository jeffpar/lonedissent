not at the time of the making of the lease. P. 499.

tion is presented under the relevant sections of the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, 1926 and 1928.1
October 13, 1906, the Irvine Company leased to the San
Joaquin Fruit Company one thousand acres, part of a
much larger tract, of bare unirrigated land in California.
The lessor was wholly owned by one Irvine, and the lessee
was organized by two experienced men who together
with Irvine subscribed its capital, in the hope that planting, irrigation, and cultivation would make the land valuable. The lease was for a term of ten years from December 1, 1906; required the lessee to plant the tract as an
orchard within four years, to procure and conduct a specified supply of irrigation water to the tract, and to raise
certain field crops in connection with the orchard; and
embodied an irrevocable option to buy the whole acreage
for $200,000, exercisable November 30, 1916. Before
October, 1908, the lessee procured the water, planted, and
was successftilly working the land; and the taking up of
the option at the end of the term was then no longer a
matter of doubt. By February 28, 1913' the value of the
property had greatly increased. On November 30, 1916,
the option was closed and conveyance made to the lessee,
which subsequently transferred the land to the respondent under circumstances which do not alter the basis for
calculation of gain. During the period 1920 to 1928, in142 Stat. 227, 229; 43 Stat. 253, 258; 44 Stat. 9, 14; 45 Stat. 791,

follow:
"Sec. 204 (a). The basis for determining the gain or loss from the
sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913,
shall be the cost of'such property; except that .. .
"(b) The basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or
other disposition of property acquired before March 1, 1913, shall be
(A) the cost of such property . ..or (B) the fair market value of
such property as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater . . ."
Section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921 speaks of "property, real,
personal, or mixed."

elusive, the respondent sold portions of the tract. In
computing the tax liability for these years the petitioner
determined the property was acquired November 30, 1916,
when the option was exercised, and its cost was the $200,000 paid plus the amounts expended for improvements
pursuant to the lease. The respondent appealed to the
Board of Tax Appeals, contending the lessee acquired a
property in the land,-an interest real,-prior to March 1,
1913, and the value of the land at that date was the proper
basis for calculating gain on sales. The Board sustained
the petitioner.' The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the Board's decision.' To resolve an asserted conflict
we granted certiorari.
We hold that the respondent acquired the property
on November 30, 1916. The option itself was property,
and doubtless was valuable. If it had been assignable,
and the lessee had sold it at a profit, taxable gain would
have resulted from the sale. But the option is admittedly not the same property as the land. So conceding,
the respondent still insists that ownership of the option
created an interest in the land. This would not be true
of a bare option unconnected with a lease; ' but we are
told that because embodied in the lease the agreement
became a covenant real and gave the lessee a species of
interest or property in the land. The weight of authority is to the contrary,' and no cited California decision

supports the position.' But even if we should agree that
a lessee-optionee acquires, by virtue of the instrument,
an equitable interest in the land it would not follow
that, within the contemplation of the revenue acts, he acquires the property at the date of the option rather than
at the date of conveyance. The word "acquired" is not a
term of art in the law of property but one in common
use. The plain import 'of the word is "obtained as one's
own." Language used in tax statutes should be read in
the ordinary and natural sense.' In the common and
usual meaning of the term the land was acquired when
conveyed to the respondent's predecessor.
The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that to avoid
serious doubts concerning the constitutional power to tax
gains accruing before March 1, 1913, it was important, if
possible, to treat the property as acquired when the option
was given. The court therefore resorted to the doctrine
that the title when acquired relates back to the date of
the option. Cited in support of this application of the
theory are cases in which the California courts have invoked it to subordinate the rights of assignees or mortgagees who became such with notice of an outstanding
option.? The fiction of relation, indulged to defeat those
dealing with the legal title with knowledge of the option,
can give no aid in solving the question of the time of the
optionee's acquirement of property under a statute taxing
gain upon a subsequent sale. And there is no need of the
fiction to avoid'any constitutional question. The power
to tax gains which accrued prior to the adoption of the
Sixteenth Amendment is not here involved. We suppose

the amount received by the respondent frorn a sle incIudes and is the result of increase in value of the property in the period prior to March 1, 1913. But the gain
accruing in that period did not accrue to property owned
by the lessee. .Neither the land nor the gain so accruing
before March 1 1913, became the lessee's property until
.1916 when it took up the option.
An alternative contention is that the exercise of the
option and the conveyance on November 30, 1916, constituted merely an exchange of capital assets,-a closed
transaction,--and the basis for calculation of gain was
the value of the land and improvements- at that date.
The capital asset, sale of which resulted in taxable gain,
was the land. This. was not an asset of the taxpayer
prior to the exercise of the option. We think it clear that
there was no combination of two capital assets,--the
optipn and $200,000 of cash, to form a new capital asset,
the land, Which was subsequently sold at a profit. The
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be
Reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 351.

Argued January 15, 16, 1936.-Decided March 2, 1936.

1. An order of the Interstate Commerce Commission adjudging a
preference illegal upon complaint of a shipper but refusing to require reparation from the carrier upon the ground that no damage
was proved, is not conclusive against the right of the complainant
to recover damages from another shipper who enjoyed the preference and who had intervened in the proceedings but against whom
no damages were there prayed. P. 511.
