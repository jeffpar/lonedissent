PACIFIC TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO. v. TAX
COMMISSION OF WASHINGTON.*
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 544.

Argued January 13, 1936.-Decided March 2, 1936.

1. Where intrastate and interstate commerce are served by the
same instrumentalities of a foreign common-carrier corporation,
a state tax on the privilege of doing the local business measured
on the gross income from that business will not be held invalid
as imposing indirectly an undue burden on the interstate business,
in the absence of proof that it actually had such effect. -P. 412.
2. No reason appears for holding such a tax upon the local business
void where, despite its burden, the local business is conducted at
a profit; or where, though conducted at an apparent loss, the
corporation wishes to continue the local business because of benefits present or prospective. P. 414.
3. The occupation tax involved in this case is held to be inherently
unobjectionable. It is not upon an instrumentality of interstate
commerce, nor is it a disguised attempt to discriminate against that
commerce; payment is not made a condition to continuance.of
business; the amount is moderate and not increaied because of
the interstate business; the tax is not inseparable, although the
two branches of the business are so. P. 414.
4. No decision of this Court supports the proposition that an
occupation tax upon local business, otherwise valid, must in such
cases be held void merely because the local and interstate branches
are for some reason inseparable. P. 415.
5. The mere fact that an occupation tax on the intrastate business
of a railroad increases an operating deficit in that branch of the
business while, according to the carrier's allocations, the interstate business is profitable, does not show that the tax is an undue
burden on the interstate business. P. 418.
6. The occupation tax, like other taxes and expenses, lessens the
benefit derived by interstate commerce from the joint operation
with it of the intrastate business of the carrier; but it is not an
undue burden on interstate commerce where, as in this case, the

advantage to the carrier, and to interstate commerce, of continuing
the intrastate business is greatly in excess of the tax. P. 419.

APPEALS in three cases from judgments sustaining the
validity of state taxes assessed against three foreign corporations, each engaged in both intrastate and interstate
business, on the privilege of doing the intrastate business.
In No. 544, the Telephone Company sued to enjoin collection. The other two cases were actions by the State to
collect the taxes from the two Railway Companies.
Mr. Otto B. Rupp, with whom Messrs. Maurice McM4licken, Alfred J. Schweppe, and Alfred Sutro were on
the brief, for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
appellant in No. 544.
It is difficult to make a correct segregation of the property, revenues and expenses of a large telephone and
telegraph company., It can only be done on a time use
basis--a method approved by this Court. LinAheimer
v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 292 U. S. 151, 155. Using that
method, a segregation of the property was made in this
case, which resulted in finding that over ninety per cent.
of the property would have to be retained if interstate
service only Was furnished. That property would be sub-.
ject to a tax burden one and one-half times as great as
the total gross amount received by the appellant in the
rendition of its interstate telephone and telegraph service. Not only so, but the property would have to be
maintained, and, even if maintained, .would depreciate.
In alddition, appellant would have to employ and pay
operators, superintendents, accountants, agents and officers, and purchase power to operate the plant.
Moreover, as a matter of law., appellant cannot withdraw from its intrastate business without also abandoning its interstate business.

Argument for Appellants.

It follows that the tax sought to be imposed by the
Act, while ostensibly levied for the privilege of doing an
intrastate business only, is in effect a tax for the privilege
of doing both kinds of business.
Discussing: Interstate Busses v. Holyoke Street Ry.

To condition appellant's right to do an intrastate business is also to condition its right to do an interstate business; and that last right is just as much conditioned if
the condition be a tax measured by gross intrastate revenues as if the condition were a tax measured by the
number of wagons or cars or telephone instruments. See
Crutcherv. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47; International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91; Western Union v. Pendleton, 122 U. S. 347; Western Union v. Kansas,-216 U. S.

Lyons was on the brief, for Northern Pacific Ry. Co.,
appellant in No. 529.
Appellant cannot abandon its local business while continuing its interstate business.
While a State may require payment of an occupation
tax by one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce, the exaction, in order to be valid under the commerce clause, must be solely on account of the intrastate
business done and the party taxed must be free in law
and fact to withdraw from the intrastate business without
withdrawing also frofn the interstate. Pullman Co. v.

U. S. 450.
The intrastate business was conducted at a loss which
must be made up from net income from interstate business and business done in other States. Appellant cannot
increase many intrastate rates because of competition of
other kinds of transportation, and for economic reasons,
nor can it do so under the laws of the State without the
consent of the Department of Public Service. Appellant
has applied for an increase .of intrastate rates, but the application was denied. Appellant, as a practical matter,
has been unable to increase its revenue from intrastate
business, and the Superior Court finds that it has done all
it can but without success.
THe obligation of intrastate business under the Transportation Act, 1920, to contribute a just proportion of
operating expense, including return on value of property,
is declared in Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. & Q. R.
Co., 257 U. S. 563. Whether the burden on interstate
commerce be due to inadequate intrastate rates, excessive
taxation, excessive expenditures in the local interest, or
otherwise, is without legal significance. Cf. Colorado v.
United States, 271 U. S. 153; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

466. Even ad valorem taxation, measured by a percentage of gross revenue, is subject to restraint of the commerce clause. Southern Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, 274 U. S.
76. Certainly, no value inheres in the so-called privilege
of being compelled to do intrastate business at a loss.
And even so, the property is otherwise taxed as a going
concern. Postal Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S.
252.
As the tax falls on income earned outside the State,
there is a violation of the due process clause. Western
Union v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1; Ludwig v. Western Union,
216 U. S. 146; Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490; Wallace v.
Hines, 253 U. S. 56; Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268 U. S. 203; Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S. 37.
Not only is there no fixed right of compensation payable
at the time of taking, but compensation will never be received because increased rates, if obtained, will not apply
retroactively.
Mr. Thomas Balmer, with whom Messrs. F. G. Dorety
and Edwin C. Matthias were on the brief, for Great
Northern Ry. Co., appellant in No. 573.
Appellant cannot withdraw from its intrastate business
in Washington and at the same time continue its interstate business, either as a matter of law, or as a matter of
fact. Therefore, under the decisions of this Court, the
tax - is a burden upon, and a regulation of, interstate
commerce, in violation of Art. I, ยง 8 of the Constitution.
Income from intrastate business is essential to appellant's existence as a carrier of interstate commerce. Abandonment of its intrastate business would have resulted
in a loss in the year 1933 of $2,179,760 and a saving of not
more than 14% of that amount. This is due to the fact
that even though local service were discontinued it would
be impossible to make much reduction in train service.
in order to continue interstate service, appellant would

297 U.S.

have to make a greater' increase in its rates and fares
than interstate commerce could bear.
As the amount of the tax, if valid, is a matter of state
discretion, an essential instrumentality of interstate commerce may be destroyed by the State. This is made more
apparent when we consider that, if the State of Washington can impose such a tax, all of the States through
which appellant's line of railroad is constructed may do
likewise.
Congress has so taken possession of the local business,
in so far as such business has a direct relation to interstate
business, that there is not room for state power to license
local business as a privilege which may be granted or denied at the will of the State, nor to take any action whatever which will disable or hamper the carrier in the performance of its duty to maintain an interstate system of
transportation and economically and efficiently serve
interstate commerce at reasonable ratep.
It is therefore obvious that the exaction of a tax by the
State for the privilege of carrying on local commerce is a
direct burden on, and a regulation of, interstate commerce, where, as here, both classes of commerce are carried over the same lines by the same employees, in the
same trains, and by the use of the same instrumentalities,
and the interstate business is absolutely dependent for its
efficient and economical transaction upon the local business. 'Even if there could have been a doubt upon this
point prior to the enactP ent of the Transportation Act,
there can be none now, in view of the provisions of that
Act, and there is therefore controlling reason for the strict
application of the rule invoked at the beginning of this
argument, in view of the amendments and additions to
the Interstate Commerce Act by the Transportation Act
of 1920. Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.,

Coast Line R. Co. v. Daughton, 262 U. S. 413.
While this Court has always held that ad valorem taxes
may be imposed upon property used in interstate commerce, it has likewise always held that an excise or license
tax which must be paid out of the receipts from interstate commerce is a burden on such commerce.
Appellant's answer alleges, and both courts below have
found, that appellant's intrastate business was conducted
at a loss during the year 1933, and that the tax in question would have to be paid out of appellant's earnings
from interstate and foreign commerce and from the income from its property located outside the State of Washington.
The tax is not rendered constitutional by the fact that
appellant did not secure permission to raise intrastate
rates which, due to competitive and economic conditions,
cannot be raised.
The following authorities point to the invalidity of the
statute under the Fourteenth Amendment: Western
Union v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1; Ludwig v. Western Union,

ad valorem taxes.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTIcE BRANDEIS

297 U.S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The State of Washington laid upon practically all persons engaged in intrastate business an occupation tax effective August 1, 1933, to continue for twenty-four
months. The tax is measured by a percentage of the
gross income solely of that business; and, as construed,
purports not to tax the privilege of -doing interstate business. The rate for telephone companies is 3 per cent; for
railroads, 11/ per cent. Laws of Washington, 1933, c. 191.
No. 544 is a suit by Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company against the Tax Commission to enjoin proceedings
to enforce the tax. No. 573 is an action by the State
against Great Nofthern Railway to collect the tax for
the period ending December 31, 1933. No. 529 is a like
action against Northern Pacific Railway. Each company
is a foreign corporation. The cases are here on appeals
from the Supreme Court of the State and were argued
together. Each presents the question whether the statute, as applied, is obnoxious to the commerce claus6 of
the Federal Constitution. The railroads claim also that
the statute violates the due process clause by taxing income earned. outside the State. In each case the trial
court held the statute void. The Supreme Court sustained its validity in all the cases. 183 Wash. 697, 698,
33; 48 P. (2d) 931, 938.
None of the companies rests its challenge of the statute
primarily upon proof that the tax, in fact, burdens interstate commerce. The Telephone Company relies wholly,
and the railroads mainly, upon an alleged rule of lawthe proposition that when a foreign corporation engages
within a State in both local and interstate commerce, an
occupation tax laid upon the local business is necessarily
void, unless the corporation is free in law and in fact to
withdraw therefrom without discontinuing its interstate
business. They urge that the alleged rule applies to

PACIFIC TEL. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.
403

Opinion of the Court.

them, claiming that inability to abandon the local business without also discontinuing the interstate is imposed
by state and federal law, and arises also from practical
considerations. They insist that the rule applies although
the tax is not such in character or amount as to induce
withdrawal from the local business. The railroads contend further that the tax, in fact, burdens interstate
commerce.
The trial court found, and the Supreme Court assumed, that practical considerations would prevent either
6f the railroads from abandoning its intrastate business
without also withdrawing from the interstate. And this
was assumed to be true of the Telephone Company. The
operations of the two classes of business are inextricably
intertwined. In the main, they are carried on at the same
time, by the same employees, with the same plant, equipment, and facilities. The interstate business is found
profitable when carried on in connection with the local,
because the expenses of the joint operation are, under
applicable accounting rules, apportioned between the
two branches of the business. Withdrawal from local
business would reduce by but a small percentage each
company's cost of operation. The remaining unavoidable expense would be heavier than the interstate business could bear under the existing rates or under any
conceivable increase. Moreover, the trial court ruled,
and the Supreme Court assumed, that the governing law
would not permit these corporations to withdraw from
local business without discontinuing also the interstate.
The State denies the existence of the alleged rule of law
that an occupation tax upon intrastate business is necessarily void, if the corporation is not free to withdraw
from the local business without discontinuing also the
interstate. There is no denial that a tax upon the privilege of engaging in the local business is void if, by reason
of its character or amount, it, in fact, imposes a direct

412

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

burden upon interstate commerce. The State insists that
this tax does not do so.
First. Where interstate and intrastate commerce are
served by the same instrumentalities of a common carrier,
it is possible that a regulation of the State applied directly
to the intrastate business only may in fact burden the
interstate. Where this occurs Congress may remove the
burden, since state regulation must yield to its paramount
power to assure adequate interstate service. That power
is comprehensive; and has, under appropriate legislation,
been extensively exercised. Through the Interstate Commerce Commission, Congress has commanded the raising
of local rates where they were so low that the intrastate
traffic did not bear its fair share of the cost of the service.
It has prevented state authorities from compelling the
erection of a union station so expensive as unduly to
deplete the financial resources of the carrier. It has prevented the construction of an intrastate branch line which
would have depleted the financial resources of the builder
or of another interstate carrier. It has curtailed existing
local service and authorized abandonment of a controlled
line, despite the carrier's contract with the State to maintain the line. Such control over intrastate commerce
exists because it is a necessary incident of freeing interstate commerce fiom burdens, obstructions or discrimination. It has been exerted wherever Congress deemed that
the State's power to regulate and promote intrastate
commerce is exercised in such a way as to prejudice the
interstate. Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S. 153,
164-166.
Similarly, where interstate and -intrastate commerce are
served by the same instrumentalities of the carrier, it is
possible that a tax applied directly to the privilege of
doing the local business may in fact burden the related
interstate business. While a State may tax the privilege
of engaging in local business, as it may regulate local

PACIFIC TEL. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.
403

41a

Opinion of the Court.

rates, it may not tax the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Taxation being one of. the forms of
regulation, Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 145
U. S. 192, 200, any tax laid directly upon the privilege is
void even in the absence of legislation by Congress "or a
finding of prejudice. As local rates may be so low, and'
the circumstances such, that these rates must be raised
in order to protect interstate commerce, so a tax on the
privilege of engaging in local business may conceivably be
so high, and the circumstances such, as to require lowering of the tax in order to protect interstate commerce.
But the high tax on the local privilege, like the low rate
for tl~e local traffic, if it burdens interstate commerce at
all, does so by reason of its consequences. This being so,
a tax upon the local-privilege only must be held valid
in the absence of proof that it imposes an undue burden
upon interstate commerce. "The question of constitutional validity is not to be determined by artificial standards." See Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472,
480. The alleged indirect tax must be judged by its
practical operation.
In its effect upon interstate commerce an occupation tax
solely upon local business does not differ from an ad
valorem property tax upon tangible property used exclusively in such business. Each increases the necessary cost
of doing the local business. Either might conceivably be
so large as to render the local business immediately unprofitable. A common carrier cannot be compelled to
carry on business indefinitely at a loss. Brooks-Scanion
Co. v. Railroad Commission, 251 U. S. 396; Bullock v.
Florida, 254 U. S. 513, 520-521; Railroad Commission v.
Eastern Texas R. Co., 264 U. S. 79, 85. * If, because of
such loss, a corporation, seeing no prospect of betterment,
wished to discontinue its local business and were prevented by law from doing so unless it discontinued also
its interstate business, the law might be held void as im-

297 U.S.

posing an unconstitutional condition upon the privilege
of engaging in interstate commerce. Compare Pullman
Co. v. Adams, 189 U. S. 420. If it was the tax which
caused the unprofitableness of the local business and,
consequently, the desire to discontinue it, the tax would
then appear as a direct burden on interstate commerce.
Compare Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249
U. S, 252, 258; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Fremont,
255 U. S. 124, 127. But no reason has been suggested
why a tax upon the local business should be held void, if
despite its burden, the local business is conducted at a
profit; or if, although conducted at an apparent loss, the
corporation desires to continue it because of benefits present or prospective. Compare Ohio Tax Cases, 232 U. S.
576, 590.
Second. Inherently the tax challenged is unobjectionable. It is not upon an instrumentality of interstate
commerce; it is moderate in amount; and is not a disguised attempt to discriminate against interstate commerce. As the collection is being made by an action at
law, the tax is not open to the objection raised in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, 125 U. S.
530, 554, that payment may be made a condition of continuing to do business. Compare Underwood Typewriter
Co. v. Chamberlain,254 U. S. 113, 119. The tax is "imposed solely on account of the intrastate business"; and
it appears "that the amount exacted is not increased
because of the interstate business done." Compare East
Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, 283 U. S. 465, 470.
Although the two branches of the business of the companies are inseparable, the tax is not laid inseparably
upon both. Thus, it is not open to the objection held
fatal in Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, and Cooney
v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 294 U. S.
384. "Certainly, one cannot avoid a tax upon a taxable
business by also engaging in a non-taxable business."
Raley & Bros. v. Richardson, 264 U. S. 157, 159-.

PACIFIC TEL. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.
403

415

Opinion of the Court.

The distinction drawn by those cases between an occupation tax valid because laid only on local business and
one void because laid inseparably upon the whole business, is clearly shown in the discussion of the two classes
of taxes involved in Bounnan v. Continental Oil Co.,
256 U. S. 642, 646-647. Taxes for the privilege of doing
local business measured by the gross income of such business have frequently been laid upon concerns engaged in
both intrastate and interstate business; and have, for
half a century, been sustained without enquiry whether
withdrawal from the local business would compel discontinuance of the interstate. That an occupation tax
upon a foreign telegraph company measured by earnings from its local business is valid, was indicated as
early as Telegraph Co. v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, 464-465;
and was definitely held in Ratterman v. Western Union
Telegraph Co., 127 U. S. 411, which has been repeatedly
cited with approval in cases involving interstate railroads
and telegraph companies.' Similarly, in Southern Ry.
Co. v. Watts, 260 U. S. 519, 529-530, a so-called franchise
tax for the privilege of doing intrastate business, measured by a percentage of the value of property subject also
to an ad valorem tax, was sustained as against both
foreign and domestic railroads.
No decision of this Court lends support to the proposition that ani occupation tax upon local business, otherwise
valid, must be held void merely because the local and
interstate branches are for some reason inseparable. In
'Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania, 128 U. S. 39, 40;
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Alabama, 132 U. S. 472, 476-477;
Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 145 U. S. 192, 201; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Charleston, 153 U. S. 692, 697; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688, 698. See also Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, 142 U. S. 339, 349-350; Cornell Steamboat Co. v.

cases relied upon by appellants there are expressions which
may seem to support that contention. But in none of
those cases was the challenged tax measured by the gross
income of the intrastate business only. In some it was
laid inseparably upon the privilege of doing both interstate and intrastate business.2 In some the case was suggested of a compulsory local service which, coupled with
a tax, -might burden interstate commerce.' In Western
Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1, and Pullman
Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 56, the question presented, and
on which the Court divided, was whether payment of a
confessedly unconstitutional tax could be made a condition of permitting a foreign corporation to exercise the
privilege of continuing to do intrastate Wusiness within
the State.' It is true that in Sprout v. South Bend, 277
U. S. 163, 171, the Court, when reciting the essentials of
a valid license fee for doing local business, said that it
must appear "that the person taxed could discontinue the
intrastate business without withdrawing also from the
interstate." ' But that statement was made in discussing
the validity of a flat bus license fee, prescribed by an
ordinance which made no distinction between busses en'Allen v. Pullman Car Co., 191 U. S. 171, 179; Galveston, H. & S.

U. S. 252, 258; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Fremont, 255 U; S.
124, 127.
' The statute was held, or assumed, to be inherently unconstitutional, because it was measured by a percentage of the authorized
capital of the companies and was, therefore, a tax upon all their
property without and within the State.
'See East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, 283 U. S. 465, 470;

Opinion of the Court.

gaged exclusively in interstate commerce, those engaged
exclusively in intrastate commerce, and those engaged in
both classes of commerce; and it must be read in that

context. The license fee was held -void, because Sprout,
who was engaged in both classes of commerce, could not
escape payment of the tax by confining himself to interstate business. The cases cited by the Court in that connection were of the same character.'
Third. The Telephone Company relies wholly upon the
alleged rule of law. It makes no claim that the tax laid
upon it in fact burdens interstate commerce. Nor could
it do so. The company's business, both the intrastate and

the interstate, was conducted at a profit during the tax
period. The net operating income from the local business for the year 1933 was $781,338.44, after deducting
taxes assignable thereto; the net operating income from
the interstate business was $118,225.74.' The tax for the
five months ending December 31, 1933, is apparently
$112,251.31. Not only is the intrastate business (even
with the addition of this tax) no burden; it is that
branch of the business which makes it financially possible
to,:arry on the interstate. The gross operating revenues
frgpi interstate business were in 1933 only $932,424.74,
while the total operating expenses of the company within
the State were $7,649,933.89. The greater part of these
expenses involved plant, equipment facilities, and employees' services indispensable to the conduct of the in'Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U. S. 640; Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S.

terstate business: of the total expenses, $7,009,241.85
was charged to the intrastate business and only $640,692.04 to the interstate. As the statute is valid in the
absence of a showing that the tax in fact directly burdened
interstate commerce, the judgment against the Telephone
Company is affirmed.,
Fourth. The Great 'Northern, besides invoking the alleged rule of law, claims that in fact the tax upon it directly burdens interstate commerce. The amount for the
five months ending December 31, 1933, is $12,988.35. To
prove that this tax burdens interstate commerce, it presented accounts which, as'the trial court found, show that
in the year 1933 the intrastate business resulted in a net
operating deficit of $99,269. But, even if the items in
the account are correct, it does not follow necessarily that
the local business (with the tax upon it) directly burdens
interstate commerce. The contrary appears. The gross
opetating revenues from the intrastate business were
$2,179,760. To it were charged $1,730,361 of the company's operating expenses, leaving net operating revenues
amounting to $449,399. The deficit of $99,269 is arrived
at by deducting from these net revenues both railway
tax-accruals to the amount of $335,247,8 and equipment
and joint facility rentals to the amount of $213,421. It
is true that, according to this allocation of the joint expenses and charges, it appears that the intrastate business was carried on at a small loss. But it is conceded
that withdrawal from intrastate business and carrying on
the interstate alone would have subjected the company
to a very heavy loss. As the trial court found: "The
net result of abandonment by defendant of its intrastate
passenger and freight business in order to escape the tax
imposed by said Chapter 191, Laws of 1933, would be the
loss of $2,179,760 lthe whole intrastate gross operating

revenues], and the saving of not more than 14% of that
amount."
It is said that the deficit from the intrastate branch
of the business was paid from profits of the interstate
branch; and it is asserted that, as the tax would increase
the amount of the deficit, it directly burdens interstate
commierce. But this does not follow. Every tax, and
every other charge or item of expense, reduces to that
extent the profit which otherwise would be made from
doing business. This tax lessens the benefit derived by
interstate commerce from the joint operation with it
of the intrastate business; but because of the advantage
to the company (and to interstate commerce) in continuing to do the intrastate business, neither the tax of
$12,988.35 here in question, nor the other taxes allocated
to the local business, would induce the company to withdraw from the local business, even if it were permitted
by law to do so. There is no more reason for saying that
the $12,988.35, because an occupation tax, directly burdens interstate commerce, since it contributes to the operating deficit, than that the $335,247 taxes paid by local
business under other statutes confessedly valid, do so.
Since this tax is laid upon intrastate commerce only and
is not shown to be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, or to be otherwise objectionable, the judgment
against, the Great Northern is affirmed. Compare Postal
Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 257,
261; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Fremont, 255 U. S.
124; Williams v. Talladega.,226 U. S. 404, 417.
Fifth. The Northern Pacific, besides invoking the alleged rule of law, claims also that the tax upon it directly burdens interstate commerce. The relevant facts
are similar to those concerning the Great Northern; and
the same rules of law govern both. The amount of the
tax for the five months ending December 31, 1933, is
$36,116.22. To prove that this tax in fact burdens inter-

state commerce, the company presented accounts which,
as the trial court found, show that in the year 1933, the
intrastate business resulted in a net operating deficit of
$192,507. On the other hand to have abandoned the
intrastate business while operating the interstate would
have cost the company gross operating revenues of
$5,271,893. Since the occupation tax challenged is not
shown to be a direct burden upon the company's interstate business, the judgment against it is affirmed.
What has been said above disposes of the contention
of the railroads that the statute violated the due process
clause. It also renders unnecessary consideration of the
additional reasons urged by the State in support of the
judgments of its Supreme Court. On these we express
no opinion.
