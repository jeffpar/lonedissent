PER CURIAM.

On February 9, 1920, Malcolm MacFarlan, a physician of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, made a transfer of
real estate and securities, of the value of upwards of
$670,000, in trust for the benefit of his children and their
wives and descendants. He died on December 8, 1921.
As his death occurred within two years after the transfer, it fell within the terms of the statute creating a pre<See Table of Cases Reported in this volume.

sumption that the transfer was made in contemplation of
death. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, ยง 402 (c), 42 Stat.
227, 277, 278. The remaining estate of the decedent,
of which disposition was made by will (executed on the
same day as the transfer in trust) was worth about $13,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included
the property transferred as part of decedent's gross
estate, and demanded payment of an estate tax upon
that basis. The payment was made, claim for refund
was rejected, and this suit was brought by the executors
of the decedent against the collector to recover the
amount paid.
A jury was waived. After the evidence had been received, both parties submitted requests for conclusions
of law, and plaintiffs also requested special findings of
fact. The court refused plaintiffs' requests and affirmed
certain conclusions of law requested by defendant, and
plaintiffs were allowed exceptions.
Referring to decedent's physical condition, the court
said in its opinion that the evidence showed that at the
time of the transfer decedent was seventy-eight years old,
unusually vigorous and clear-minded and, except for a
condition common in men of his age, in good health. The
court said that the most that could be claimed for that
evidence was that it established, and the court specifically found, that the transfer was not made "under any
consciousness or belief or apprehension that death was
imminent." The substance of the court's conclusion on
all the evidence was that "the plaintiffs have failed to
show that the motive that induced this transfer, whatever it was, was not of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition, and, consequently have failed to
meet the burden of proof placed upon them by the statute." The court then found a general verdict in favor
of the defendant and directed judgment accordingly.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U. S.

The Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the evidence,
decided that the transfer was not made in contemplation
of death, and reversed the judgment. 79 F. (2d) 602.
The principles governing the determination whether
a gift inter vivos is made "in contemplation of death" are
set forth in United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, and
need not be restated. The instant case is controlled by
the established rules relating to appellate review in actions at law where a jury trial has been waived. R. S.
649, 700; 28 U. S. C. 773, 875. Where a general verdict
is found by the trial court, it has the same effect as the
verdict of a jury. The appellate court cannot pass upon
the weight of evidence. Norris v. Jqckson, 9 Wall. 125,
128; British Queen Mining Co. v. Baker Silver Mining
Co., 139 U. S. 222; Lehnen v. Dickson, 148 U. S. 71, 73;
St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 166 U. S. 388;
Law v. United States, 266 U. S. 494; Fleischmann Construction Co. v. United States, 270 U. S. 349, 356, 357;
Harvey Company v. Malley, 288 U. S. 415, 418, 419;
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Gray, 292 U. S. 332, 336, 337.
Here, plaintiffs' exceptions to the conclusions of law
of the trial court, and to the refusal of the court to reach
other conclusions as requested, raised iuo question save
the one of law, whether the court's verdict was wholly
without evidence to sustain it. That question does not
appear to be substantial. The ultimate question for
the decision of the trial court was one of fact and its general verdict was conclusive. The Circuit Court of Appeals was without authority to weigh the evidence and
to make its own findings.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Couit is affirmed.
Reversed.
