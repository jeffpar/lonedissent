THE WINNEBAGO.1
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
Nos. 218, 219.

Argued February 28, 1907.-Decided April 8, 1907.

A state law will not be held unconstitutional in a suit coming from a state
court at the instance of one whose constitutional rights are not invaded,
because as against a class making no complaint it might be held unconstitutibnal.
Whether a state lien statute, otherwise constitutional, applies to vessels
not to be used in the waters of the State; on whose credit the supplies
were furnished; whether the lien was properly filed as to time and place;
and what the effect thereof is as to bona fide purchasers without notice,
are not Federal questions, but the judgment of the state court is final and
conclusive on this court.
Whether a state lien statute is unconstitutional as permitting the seizure
and sale of a vessel and the distribution of the proceeds in conflict with

205 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty of the Federal courts will not be
determined in a suit from the state courts where no holder of a maritime
lien is present contesting the unconstitutionality of the statute.
A contract to build a vessel is not a maritime contract enforceable only in
admiralty, but the remedy is within the jurisdiction of the state court,
and this rule applies to items furnished the vessel after she has been
launched, but which are really part of her original construction.
142 Michigan, 84, affirmed.

THESE cases may be considered together. They are writs
of error to the judgments of the Supreme Court of Michigan
affirming the decrees of the Circuit Court of Wayne County,
Michigan, enforcing liens for the De Laney Forge and Iron
Company, defendant in error, in 218, and George W. Edwards
and others, defendants in error in 219, and intervenors in the
original case.
The Winnebago, a steel steamer of 1,091 tons burthen, was
built by the Columbia Iron works, at St. Clair, Michigan.
The contract price was $95,000; date of contract, March 8,
1902; between the Columbia Iron Works and John J. Boland
and Thomas J. Prindeville. It was understood that these
persons should organize a corporation to be known as the
Iroquois Transportation Company. The contract price was
to be paid, $31,000 in cash, from time to time; for the-balance
the transportation company was to execute its notes to the
amount of $16,000, to issue bonds for $48,000, to be secured
by mortgage upon its property. On April 5, 1902, Boland
and Prindeville assigned the contract to the Iroquois Transportation Company. Payments were made on the contract
as follows: $7,500, at date of signing contract; $7,500, April 3,
1902; $4,000, April 14, 1902; $4,000, June 15, 1902; $4,000,
July 15, 1902.
An additional $4,000 was paid on October 3, 1902, and two
negotiable notes of $4,000 given, maturing respectively November 1, 1903, and November 1, 1904.
The steamer was launched March 21, 1903. After she was
in the water the work on the contract continued. On July 18,
1903, she was inspected, measured, enrolled and licensed to

be employed in domestic and foreign trade. This license was
issued in the name of the Columbia Iron Works as owner.
On July 19, 1903, the Iroquois Transportation Company
received a bill of sale of the steamer and delivered to the Colimbia Iron Works ninety-six negotiable bonds of $500 each,
secured by mortgage on the steamer, and paid the balance 6f
the purchase money, which was to be paid in cash, then amounting to between $400 and $500.
The agreement recited that possession was given to the
Iroquois Transportation Company for the purpose of completing and finishing up those things still remaining undone
on the steamer and required to be done by the iron works by
the terms of the contract for the construction of the steamer,
"it being the sole intent and p rpose of this agreement to enable the Iroquois Transportation Company to obtain immediate
possession of the steamer, and without intending either to
limit the extent of the obligation of said Columbia Iron Works
under the original specifications."
The steamer left St. Clair for Lorain, Ohio, July 19, 1903.
At that time she was not completed, and workmen remained
on her and went with her to St. Clair, where additional work
was done upon her. She was afterwards engaged in carrying
cargoes between points on Lake Erie and Lake Superior.
On July 30, 1903, the Columbia Iron Works made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. On August 25, 1903, the
De Laney Forge and Iron Company served notice on the Iroquois Transportation Company that it made a claim of lien
against the steamer for forging and material furnished; and
on October 6, 1903, complaint was filed in the Circuit Court
of Wayne County, Michigan, and shortly thereafter Edwards
and others intervened in the case, claiming a lien. The Iroquois Company gave a bond under the statute for the release
of the vessel. Decrees' were rendered in favor of the claimants
and intervenors in the Circuit Court of Wayne County, and
upon appeal they were affirmed in the Supreme 'Court of Michigan. 142 Michigan, 84.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mr. Charles E. Kremer, with whom Mr. William T. Gray
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The Winnebago was, at the time of her seizure, ,not used
or intended to be used in navigating the waters and canals
of this State. Sauter v. The Sea Witch, 1 California, 162;
Tucker v. Sacramento, 1 California, 403; Ray v. Henry Harbeck,
1 California, 451; Haytien Republic, 65 Fed. Rep. 120.
A proceeding under the statutes of Michigan against a vessel
which has already been enrolled and licensed under the laws
of the United States, and at the time of the seizure was actually
engaged in interstate commerce, is unconstitutional and void
because in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United
States. The Glide, 167 U. S. 606; Johnson v. Elevator Company, 119 U. S. 397; White's Bank v. Smith, 7 Wall. 646; The

The Winnebago, engaged in interstate commerce, was not
subject to seizure while passing from port to port through
the waters within the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Michigan. Mich. C. R. Co. v. Chicago M. L. S. Co., 1 Ill. App.

The contract to build a ship is a maritime contract and
therefore there is a lien for material and labor furnished which
can be enforced in a court of admiralty, there being a lien
under the state law. People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 383;

jurisdiction of the Federal courts in admiralty cases: The
Glide, 167 U. S. 606 and Perry v. Haynes (The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, distinguished.
Even if the Michigan statute is unconstitutional in some
respects, it is constitutional and valid, insofar as it relates to
the claims in controversy here, and the part being dealt with
in this controversy is not so related in substance, and the provisions are not so interdependent that one cannot operate
without the other. Under, such circumstances, the part that
is "constitutional' will, under all the authorities, stand. 6

take cognizance- of them. The Iosco, Bro. Adm. 495; S. C.,

at the time appearance was asked or service accepted, the whole
trend of judicial authority, as evidenced by the references

above made, is to the effect that the State here had complete
power to make and enforce the law here made and enforced,
insofar as it relates to the non-maritime matter here under
discussion, and that its enforcement is not a regulation of commerce. Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, 74; Johnson v. Elevator Co., 119 U. S. 388, 398; Cannon v. New Orleans, 20 Wall.

MR. JUSTICE

DAY,

after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The Michigan statute, under which the liens are claimed in
this case, is as follows:
"Third Compiled Laws of Michigan, p. 3254:
"(10789) Sec. 2. Every water craft of above five tons burthen, used or intended to be used, in navigating the waters of
this State, shall be subject to a lien thereon:
"First; for all debts contracted by the owner or part owner,
master, clerk, agent or steward of such craft, on account of
supplies and provisions furnished for the use of said water
craft, on account of work done or services rendered, on board
of such craft, by seamen, or any employ6, other than the master
thereof; on account of work done or service rendered by any
person in or about the loading or unloading of said water craft;
on account of work done or materials furnished by mechanics,
tradesmen, or others, in or about the building, repairing,
fitting; furnishing or equipping such craft: Provided, That
when labor shall be performed or materials furnished, as aforesaid, by a subcontractor or workman other than an original
contractor, and the same is not paid for, said person or persons
may give the owner or his agent, or the master or clerk of said
craft, timely notice 6f his or their said claim, and from thenceforth said person or persons shall have a lien upon said craft
.pro rata for his or their said claims, to the amount that may
be due by said owner of said original contractor for work or
labor then done onaid water craft."

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

205 U. S.

Several objections are urged by the plaintiff in error which,
if sustained; will result in the reversal of the judgments of
the Supreme Court of Michigan. Some of them are of a nonFederal character. It is insisted that the statute does not
apply in this case, because the steamer Winnebago was not
to be used in navigating the waters of Michigan, within the
terms of the statute. But this only presents a question of.'
state law, upon which the judgment of the'state court is. final
and conclusive. The same may be said as to the objection
because the transportation company was a bona fide purchaser
without notice of complainant's lien, and because complainant
did not Within a year file its claim for a lien with the proper
court in the county in which it resided. These are state questions, likewise concluded by the decision of the state court.
It is further contended that to seize the vessel and subject
her to sale and the proceeds thereof to distribution in the
state court would be in'
direct conflict with the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty in the courts of the-United States in favor
of liens of a maritime character, and therefore the Michigan
act is unconstitutional. No maritime lien is asserted in this
case, and it is merely a matter of speculation as to whether
any such claim existed, or might be thereafter asserted. No
holder of any such maritime lien is here contesting the constitutionality of the state law.
In a case from a state court, this court does not listen to
objections of those who do not come within the class whose
-constitutional rights are alleged to be invaded; or hold a law
unconstitutional because, as against the class making no complaint, the law might be so held. This was distinctly ruled
in a case decided at this term. New York ex rel. Hatch v.
Reardon, 204 U. S. 152. See also Supervisor v. Stanley, 105
U. S. 305-311; Lampasas v. Bell, 180 U. S. 276, 283, 284;
Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U: S. 114-118; Cronin v. Adams,
192 U. S. 108-114.
There is no one in position in this. case to make this objection, and, for aught that this record discloses, no such maritime

THE WINNEBAGO.
205 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

lien existed. If this statue is. broad enough to include strictly
maritime liens, it can only be-held unconstitutional, in a case
coming from a state court, where the complaint on that ground
is made by the holder of such a demand. We agree with Judge
Severens, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit, ina case directly involving this question, where

other claimants upon the Winnebago had removed a case to
the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, whence it was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals:
"And the fact that she [the Winnebago] might become subject to maritime liens would not destroy liens already lawfully
acquired. It is true she might become subject to maritime
liens which would be superior to the existing lien, and that
such liens would have to be enforced in the admiralty. But
that possibility does not defeat the enforcement by the state
court of the non-maritime lien to which she is subject. How
else is -the owner of the latter to obtain his remedy? It may
be the vessel will never become subject to maritime liens at
all; and, if so, the holder of the existing lien may never have
even the privilege of proving his claim in some cause instituted
for another purpose, but no such supposed embarrassment has
yet occurred. And they are as yet imaginary. But suppose
such other liens should attach. That should not prevent the
enforcement of the earlier lien in the proper court. If the
holder of the earlier lien delays his action, he subjects himself
to the danger of superior liens becoming fastened, and the
enforcement- of his own lien in the state court must -leave the
vessel subject to the superior liens of which the state court
cannot take cognizance.

If occasion requires, and the admir-

alty court enforces the superior liens, it is in no wise obstructed
by the action of the state court, and a title under a decree of
the former court-would defeat the title gained under the decree
of the state court. The case of Moran v. Sturgis, 154 U. S.
256 is a good illustration of this subject. There is no difficulty
other than such as may happen in case one court should take
and have possession of the vessel at a time when the other

205 U. S.

should require it; but that is an incident common along all the
lines of concurrent proceedings in the state and Federal courts,
and gives no ground for the denial of jurisdiction to either."
The Winnebago, 73 C! C. A. 295.
It is next insisted that the materials and supplies were not
furnished on the credit of the vessel, but were contracted for,
furnished and delivered on the credit of the Columbia Iron
Works.
The findings upon this proposition are again questions within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state court. The findings
will not be disturbed here.
It is next objected that the court erred because certain items
were allowed for material furnished the vessel after she was
launched, and therefore the subject of exclusive jurisdiction
for which a lien could only be enforced in the admiralty.
But we agree with the state court that these items were really
furnished for the completion of the vessel and were fairly a
part of her original construction. In such a case the remedy
was w'thin the jurisdiction of the state court. The Iosco,
Fed. Cas. 7060; The Victorian, 24 Oregon, 121; The Winnebago,
73 C. C. A. 295.
It is urged that the attempt to enforce the lien on the vessel
was while she was engaged in interstate commerce, and therefore proceedings against her were unlawful and void, in view
of the exchisive control of this subject by Congress under the
Constitution and laws of the United States. But it must be
remembered, that concerning contracts not maritime in their
nature, the State has authority to make laws and enforce liens,
and it is no valid objection that the enforcement of such laws
may prevent or obstruct the prosecution of a voyage of an
interstate character,. , The laws of the States enforcing attachment and execution in cases cognizable in state courts have
been sustained and upheld. Johnson v. Chicago & Pacific
Elevator Co.,. 119 U. S. 388-398. The State may pass laws
enforcing the rights of its citizens which affect interstate commerce but fall short of regulating Auch commerce in the sense

Opinion of the Court.

in which the Constitution gives exclusive jurisdiction to Congress. Sherlock et al. v. Ailing, 93 U. S. 99, 103; Kidd v.
Pearson, 128.U. S. 1, 23;. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Hughes,
191 U. S. 477.
Upon the subject, Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court
in Knapp v. McCaflery, 177 U. S. 638-642, said:
"That wherever any lien is given by a state statute for a
cause of action cognizable in admiralty, either in rem or in
personam, proceedings in rem to enforce such lien are within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty courts.
"But the converse of this proposition is equally true, that
if a lien upon a vessel be created for a claim over which a court
of admiralty has no jurisdiction in any form, such lien may be
enforced in the courts of the State. Thus, as the admiralty
jurisdiction does not extend to a contract for building a vessel,
or to work done or materials furnished in the construction
(The Jefferson, People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393;
The Capitol, Roach v. Chapman, 22 How. 129), we held in
Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, that in respect to such contracts it was competent for the States to enact such laws as
their legislatures might deem just and expedient, and to provide for their enforcement in rem."
The contract in this case being for the construction of oa
vessel, and its enforcement within the power and jurisdiction
of the state courts, we do not think that execution of such a
decree can be avoided because the vessel engaged in interstate
commerce.
Finally, an elaborate and able argument is made in support
of the contention that a contract to build a ship is a maritime
contract, and therefore can be enforced only in admiralty,
but as late as this term, in Graham v. Morton Transportation
Company, this contention was overruled upon the authority
of the previous decisions of this court. 203 U. S.577.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Michigan are
Affirmed.
