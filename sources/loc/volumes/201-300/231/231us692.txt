the value of the estate as a profit, so that the question was
narrowed to one of amount. The principle being settled
in this way it was applied to the unsold crops. We do not
go behind these well warranted findings of fact and really
there is nothing else before us. The assignment of errors
raised some other points, but these were the only matters
that were pressed in the final argument or that could have
been pressed with any hope of success. It is suggested
that if otherwise right the judgment charged the appellants
with some items twice over. We do not see it, but if there
has been any oversight in this respect our affirmance of the
judgment will be without prejudice to reopening the
account for the single purpose of correcting errors of calculation if permitted upon application to the Supreme
Court.
Judgment affirmed.

HOBBS v. HEAD AND DOWST COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 148.

Argued December 18, 19, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

Even though contractors may not be entitled to a mechanics' lien
under the statute unless the contract be completed, they may be
entitled thereto if absolute completion is waived, and in this case
this court will not go behind the finding of the master followed by
the court below that there was a waiver and the contractor was
justified in stopping work.
Where the state trial court had upheld a mechanics' lien before the
petition and the trustee in bankruptcy seeks in the Federal court to
prevent the enforcement of the lien, this court will not go behind the
state judgment because exceptions thereto had not been passed
upon owing to the action of those representing the estate.
In this case this court is satisfied that substantial justice has been

done in enforcing a lien for over $45,000 admittedly due to the contractor but contested because about $1,000 of work remained uncompleted on a contract of $187,000, the contractors having ceased
work after the owner of the building had failed in its payments and
was hopelessly insolvent.
175 Fed. Rep. 501,. affirmed.

THE facts, which involve, the validity of a lien for labor
and materials on property of a bankrupt, and the necessity
for completion of the contract in order to maintain the
lien, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Henry F. Hollis for appellant:
The alleged lien has no legal standing under the statute.
See N. H. Pub. Stats., c. 141, §§ 10, 16, 17.
The lienors are not entitled to a mechanics' lien because:
They deliberately, willfully, and without legal excuse,
failed to complete their contract; nothing is due and payable under said contract; the contract is entire and no way
is provided to apportion non-lienable items.
All the mechanics' lien cases which are reported in New
Hampshire reports are as follows and sustain this contention: Jacobs v. Knapp, 50 N. H. 71; Bryant v. Warren, 51

Argument for Appellant.

231 U. S.

A mechanics' lien is a creature of the statute, and can

only be obtained by a strict compliance with the letter
of the law. Marston v. Stickney, 55 N. H. 383; Jacobs v.
Knapp, 50 N. H. 71, 80; Bicknell v. Trickey, 34 Maine,
273, 281; Trask V. Searle, 121 Massachusetts, 229; Gale v.

27 Cyc. 20.
The lien was not recognized at common law. Van Stone
v. Company, 142 U. S' 128, 136.
Under the New Hampshire and similar statutes, the
lien suit must be based upon an express contract with the
owner, in existence when the service is performed. It cannot be based upon a quantum meruit, or implied assumpsit.

In case there is an express contract, there can be no
lien unless the elaimant show one of three things: That

138 N. W. Rep. (Mich.) 275.
The lienor willfully failed to complete the shutters, at
an estimated expense of $1,000 and damage to that
amount accrued thereby.
The completion of the contract was not prevented
although it was somewhat delayed by the owner; performance of the contract was not waived.
The only excuse for the failure to complete the contract
was failure of the owner to make its payments under the
contract.
Breach by one party is no excuse for failure to perform
by the other party. Geary v. Bangs, 33 Ill. App. 582,

terms of the contract, payments become due only upon the
performance of certain unperformed conditions.
Nothing can be recovered under a contract until the
contract has been complied with. Robinson v. Crowninshield, 1 N. H. 76; Currier v. Railroad, 34 N. H. 398;

Nothing being due under the contract, no recovery can

As the creditor can maintain no action against the
debtor until his demand is due and payable, he cannot
until that time secure his lien by attachment. The

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This case arises upon a petition by a trustee in bankruptcy to prevent the enforcement of a lien for labor and
materials in a state court. The proceedings in the state
court were begun and had passed to a judgment in the
Superior Court of New Hampshire, subject to exceptions,
before the adjudication of bankruptcy. Afterwards the
exceptions were overruled on technical grounds not touching the merits, the trustee in bankruptcy being heard at
this stage. The action upon the matter in the courts of
the United States will be seen in 169 Fed. Rep. 586, S. C.,
95 C. C. A. 84; 175 Fed. Rep. 501, and 184 Fed. Rep. 409,
S. C., 106 C. C. A. 519; a rehearing being denied upon the
last decision in 185 Fed. Rep. 1006, S. C., 107 C. C. A.
663, and an appeal to this court allowed in 191 Fed. Rep.
811, S. C., 112 C. C. A. 325.. The allowance of the appeal
was correct. Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co., 216 U. S.
545; Greey v. Dockendorff, ante, p. 513.
The Head and Dowst Company had agreed with the
bankrupt to erect a grand. stand, clubhouse, and other
buildings and structures, for $187,644, and had completed
the work, with the exception of shutters on the grand
stand that would cost about $1000 to finish. At this point

it was told by the bankrupt of the hopeless insolvency of
the latter and was informed that it must look to its lien
to support its claim. Thereupon the company stopped
work and began its lien suit. When the present attempt

was made to reopen the matter, the case was sent to a
Master who reported in great detail the facts just summed
up and concluded that the Company was entitled to a
lien for $45,995.02, exclusive of interest, that being the
part of the contract price remaining unpaid, less $1000 for
the shutters &c., and being also very nearly the same sum
that was found due in the state court. The judge of the
District Court thereupon dismissed the trustee's petition,
and his decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 175 Fed. Rep. 501, sup.
We shall consider such questions only as are sufficient
to decide the case, omitting others that would have to
be considered before the decree belorw could be reversed.
The trustee argues that the failure to take the proper
steps to get exceptions heard by the Supreme Court of
the State on the merits constitutes an equitable ground
for going behind the state judgment in order to defeat
it by an objection of the most narrowly technical sort.
The objection of course is that the contract was entire,
and that whatever justification there may have been for
stopping work, or ground for a quantum meruit, nothing
short of complete performance would earn the contract
price as such, or establish a lien for the same. It is argued
in the same connection that the facts did not justify the
Company in stopping work, but we shall not go behind the
finding of the Master in this respect, followed as it has
been, or say more than that, as we construe the facts and
finding, it was quite right, and that putting on the last
touches was waived.
We are of opinion that the decision was equally right.
The case was tried upon its merits and decided in favor
of the lien by the state court. The failure to get the

UNITED STATES v. MOIST.
231 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

exceptions considered was due to no fault of the appellee,
but solely to the conduct of those then representing the
interests of the estate. It is a doubtful suggestion that an
equity could be founded upon this. Certainly it is an
inadequate ground for the intervention of equity to enforce forfeiture of a claim that could not be defeated, if
at all, except by a most technical application of the law,
and on the assumption that the state court did not know
the law of the State. We shall not speculate upon that
point, beyond saying that we see no reason to doubt that
the state court was right, Bergfors v. Caron, 190 Massachusetts, 168, and cases in 27 Cyc. 85, 87, and .20 Am. &
Eng. Encyc. of Law, 2d ed., 366-368, as we are satisfied
that substantial justice has been done. Some subordinate
matters of detail were argued but they do not seem to us
to need mention; the who~le strength of the case lay in the
matter of which we have disposed.
Decree affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. MOIST.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 378.

Submitted October 22, 1913.-Decided January 5, 1914.

Where it does not appear that the judgment sustaining a demurrer to
the indictment turned upon any controverted construction of the
statute, this court has not jurisdiction to review under the Criminal
Appeals Act of March 2, 1907.
In this case as it does not appear upon what ground the court below
acted in sustaining the demurrer the writ of error is dismissed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
