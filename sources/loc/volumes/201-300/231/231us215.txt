Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

KENER, ADMINISTRATOR OF KENER, v.
LA GRANGE MILLS.
ERROR TO THE -SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
GEORGIA.

No. 63.

Argued November ].3, 1913.

Decided December 1, 1913.

state constitution cannot exempt property from existing liens nor
can Congress give such constitution greater effect; and so held that
under the Bankruptcy Act of .867 as amended by the act of March 3,
1873, c. 235, 17 Stat. 577, a homestead in Georgia was not exempted
from liens which had attached prior to the bankruptcy, notwithstanding provisions in the- Georgia Constitution to that effect.
Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610.
135 Georgia, 730, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 as amended by the act of 1873, are

stated in the opinion.
Mr. Daniel W. Rountree, Mr. Clifford L. Anderson and
Mr. W. H. Terrell, for plaintiff in error, submitted:
The bankrupt homestead was set aside by the assignee
in bankruptcy, and what has been done by the assignee
is equivalent to compliance with the State's statutes in.
assigning homestead or claiming exemption. Ross v.
Worsham, 65 Georgia, 622.
Under the constitution and laws of Georgia, a sale of a
homestead exemption pending the homestead estate, that
is to say, during the life of the widow or minority of the
children, is void. Dozier v. McWhorter, 113 Georgia, 584;

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

261 U. S.

Under the act of 1868, a debt was released by a discharge whether scheduled or not. Heard v. Arnold, 56
Georgia, 576; Beck v. Crumb, Ibid. 95.
An exemption in bankruptcy made Under the constitution of 1868, is not subject to a judgment founded on a
debt contracted prior to the adoption of such constitution,
under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 as amended in 1872
and again in 1873.
This act has been declared unconstitutional and void
in this and other cases such as In re Deckert, 2 Hughes,
183; In re Duerson, 7 Fed. Cas. No. 4117; In re Dillard,
7 Fed. Cas. No. 3912; In re Shipman, 14 N. B. R. 570;
S. C., 21 Fed. Cas. No. 12791.
The same act was held to be valid in-In re Smith, 2
Woods, 458; In re Jordan, 13 Fed. Cas. No. 7515; In re
Beckerford, 1 Dill. 45; In re Jordan, 8 N. B. R. 180; In re
Kean, 2 Hughes, 322; In re Smith, 22 Fed. Cas. No. 12986;
Windley v. Tankard, 88 N. Car. 223; Lamb v. Chamness,
84 N. Car. 379; Simpson v. Houston, 97 N. C. 344; Darling
v. Berry, 13 Fed. Rep. 659.
The impairment clause is only a restriction upon the
States. No provision of the Constitution prohibits Congress from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. On the contrary the power to enact bankrupt
laws plainly authorizes it to annul or impair the obligations of contracts. Satterlee v. Mathewson, 2 Pet. 380, 416;
Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall. 603; Legal Tender Cases, 12
Wall. 457, 550, and 110 U. S. 421, 449; Mitchell v. Clark,
110 U. S. 633.
Nor was the act inconsistent with a uniform system of
bankruptcy. As against debts contracted before the
adoption of the laws authorizing it, the exemption was
valid and this was true in every State and therefore uniform. See cases decided under act of 1898. Hanover Nat.
Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181; Holden v. Stratton, 198
U. S. 202, 214; Thomas v. Woods, 173 Fed. Rep. 585, 591;

Opinion of the Court.

In re Rouse, Hazard & Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 96, 99. Bush v.
Lester, 55 Georgia, 579, was erroneously decided.
Mr. Louis Marshall for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit to recover an interest in land sold on execution against Godfred Kener and held by the defendant
in error under that sale. The plaintiff is the representative
of one of Kener's heirs. The facts are these. A judgment
was recovered upon a bill of exchange against Godfred
Kener in 1858 and execution issued in 1873; in 1878 he was
adjudged a bankrupt and returned the holders of the judgment among his creditors, but they did not prove their
claim. In the same year this land was set aside in due
form to Kener as his homestead exempted by the state
constitution of 1868 and the Bankruptcy Act then in
force. Rev. Sts., ยง 5045. In June, 1879, he died and in
December, 1879, the execution was levied and this land
was sold. The sale was valid unless the Bankruptcy Act
interfered. The trial court entered judgment for the
defendant and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme
Court of the State. 135 Georgia, 730.
The Bankruptcy Act of 1867 as amended by the act
of March 3, 1873, c. 235, 17 Stat. 577, Rev. Stat., ยง 5045,
preserved, within a limit, exemptions under state laws
and provided that such exemptions should be valid against
debts contracted before those laws and against liens by
judgment of any state court. The plaintiff bases his
claim upon this act. But inGunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610,
argued and decided (March 31, 1873) just after the
amendment of March 3, it was held that the Georgia
constitution could not exempt property from existing
liens, and that Congress could not give that constitutiori
greater effect. See also In re Deckert, 2 Hughes, 183.. In re

Syllabus.

Rahrer, 140 U. S. 545, 560. In In re Shipman, 2 Hughes,
227, it seems to have been supposed that the act of 1873,
wrongly called of 1874, was passed to meet Gunn v. Barry,
in the teeth of the declaration that such an attempt
would be invalid. But that was a mistake.
Of course if the constitution of 1868 and statutes based
upon it should be construed as not attempting, to disturb
then existing liens, the act of Congress hardly would be
read as purporting to give a greater scope to the state
laws. The Georgia decisions since Gunn v. Barry agree
that in cases like the present the lien remained. Bush v.
Lester, 55 Georgia, 579. Whether the result be reached by
construction of the state laws, by construction of the
former Bankruptcy Act, or on constitutional grounds, it
comes to the same thing, and the judgment below was
right.
Judgment affirmed.

having the custody of such property to surrender it in a proceeding
to which the United States is not,'and cannot be made, a party.
