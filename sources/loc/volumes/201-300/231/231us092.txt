OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Statement of the Case.

231 U. S.

SUMMERS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 502.

Argued October 22, 23, 1913.-Decided November 10, 1913.

The court will if possible avoid construing a code of procedure as establishing a dual instead of a single procedure in the prosecution of
crimes committed within the same territorial jurisdiction.
The fact that the courts of Territories may have such jurisdiction of
cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as
that vested in the circuit and district courts does not make them circuit and district courts of the United States.
The Alaskan Code of Criminal Procedure is very complete and circumstantial. It covers every step in a criminal proceeding including the
form of indictment of all crimes whether specifically defined therein
or not.
Prior to the amendment of 1913, § 43 of Title II of the Alaskan Code
of Criminal Procedure providing that the indictment must charge
but one crime and in one form only, applied to the indictment for any
offense whether specifically defined in that Code or not.
It is a substantial right, and not a mere matter of procedure, to have the
indictment confined to one offense and in one form only; and the
amendment of 1913 to such § 43, permitting the joinder of several
offenses, did not have retrospective operation.
The principle that one good count will support a judgment of conviction does not apply where the accused has the right to defend against
the validity of the indictment for joining the counts and this right
has not been lost by failure to plead the defect.
Fault cannot be imputed by the appellate court to the accused for
standing on a right under the law as it existed at the time of the trial
because the law has been so amended meanwhile as to eliminate such
right.
This court, having sustained appellant's contention that the indictment
was insufficient, refrains from expressing any opinion on other contentions of appellant.

Petitioner has not been deprived of any constitutional
or statutory right to trial by jury. Diaz v. United States,
223 U. S. 442, 454.
The right to trial by jury is the right as it existed at
common law. Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 349;
Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 549; Schick v. United

People v. Chew Lan Ong, 141 California, 550; State v.
Almy, 67 N. H. 274.
At common law when a demurrer to an indictment,
whether for misdemeanor or felony, was overruled, the
defendant had no right to plead over, but the court entered judgment and imposed sentence; however, in some
cases the court in its discretion permitted the demurrer
to be withdrawn and a plea, to be entered. 2 Hawkins

of trial by jury. It, and the statute which it embodied (17
Stat. 1580) were intended to modify the common-law rule
and to give to every defendant, as a matter of right, an
opportunity to defend on the facts after an indictment
against him had been held good on*:demurrer. But Congress did not intend to make necesry a jury trial, if a
defendant preferred to receive sentence on demurrer,
either because he had no defense on the facts, or was content to rely on questions of law on appeal. See Walden v.
Holman, 2 Ld. Raym. 1015; 7 Wentworth, 347; Keigwin's
Precedents of PL., p. 348.
The practice followed in the case was in strict accordance
with the petitioner's right. The judgment overruled the
demurrer without more. Smith v. Harris, 12 Illinois, 462,
466.
Section 1032, Rev. Stat., is not applicable to this case.
2 Hale P. C. 315.
The common law is legislated into Alaska by § 218 of the
Penal Code of 1899 and by § 367 of the act of June 6, 1900
(31 Stat. 321).
Under the common law, as shown, a judgment is final
when the party stands on his demurrer. People v. King, 28
California, 265. Me McQuown, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1136,
distinguished.
Section 1026 did not therefore go to the jurisdiction of
the court; it merely invested petitioner with a right which
he was free to assert, but which he might waive by his
voluntary act. When he declined to proceed to trial and
persuaded the court to impose sentence on the demurrer,
he was bound by his election. Diaz v. United States, 223

judgment below will not be reversed if upon rehearing the
same order must be entered.
Even if § 43 of the Alaskan Code governed at the time
of trial, that section has now been amended to accord with
§ 1024, Rev. Stat.
An appellate court will decide a matter upon the law in
force at the time of its decision; so that an error may become immaterial by reason of a change in the law. United

a legal sense occasioned no possible prejudice. Royal Ins.

The amended statute is not ex post facto as applied to
offenses committed before its passage. It is a mere change
in the rules of procedure, which dispenses with none of the
substantial protections with which the law surrounds the
accused. Cooley, Const. Lim. (7th ed.), 326; Mallett v.

Prejudice cannot be shown because the error might have
been cured had petitioner gone to trial; if he had been
acquitted on all counts there would have been nothing to
appeal from.
Where there is a misjoinder of counts in an indictment
and a conviction on one only, the error is immaterial.

The practice in this case is governed by § 1024, Rev.
Stat., and not by § 43 of the Alaskan Code.
The Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes of Alaska apply only to the crimes therein mentioned, and not to crimes
defined in the Revised Statutes or other general laws of
the United States. See 30 Stats. 1253, § 1891, Rev. Stat.;

States, 27 Fed. Rep. 351; Carter's Alaska Codes, p. xvii.
Under the act of 1899 those Oregon statutes which
Congress deemed applicable to Alaska were codified.
The Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes are coextensive, and the provisions of the Procedure Code relate only
to those offenses defined in the Penal-Code.

Alaska. Section 1891, Rev. Stat., applies to Alaska since
it became an organized Territory by the act of May 17,

Section 1024 is locally applicable to Alaska. It applies
to all courts of the United States. Whenever the District
Court for Alaska is exercising the jurisdiction of a district
court of the United States the Federal rules apply. McAllister v. United States, 141 U. S. 174; Steamer Coquitlam

United States, 23 App. D. C. 475.
A dual system of procedure does exist in Alaska. There
is a dual jurisdiction both Federal and territorial. Ex

Henkel, 198 U. S. 1, 13.
If a dual practice exists as to these things there can be
no objection to other differences in practice as applied to
prosecutions for Federal crimes. The cases cited by petitioner do not support his contention. Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434; Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648;

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
Petitioner was indicted under § 5209 of the Revised
Statutes, relating to national banks, and was charged with
fifty-six separate violations of the section. He demurred
to the indictment on the ground, among others, that it
violated § 43 of the Criminal Code of Alaska, known as
Carter's Code, in that more than one crime was charged.
Act of March 3, 1889, Title II, c. 429, 30 Stat. 1253, 1290.
The demurrer was overruled, to which ruling petitioner
excepted. He then gave written notice "of election to
stand upon the said demurrer and not further plead and
to take advantage of the provisions of section 97 of the
Alaskan Code of Criminal Procedure, and to submit to
judgment thereunder and forthwith take his appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit."
The Government objected to the entry of judgment
until the cause had been submitted to a jury for trial and
a verdict rendered, urging that § 97 of the Code of Alaska
(30 Stat. 1267) did not apply but that §§ 1026 and 1032 1'
of the Revised Statutes governed the procedure. After
argument, the court ruled that the Federal procedure
Drevailed in all proceedings in the cause, but that the de1

SEc. 1032. When any person indicted for any offense against the
United States, whether capital or otherwise, upon his arraignment
stands mute, or refuses to plead or answer thereto, it shall be the duty
of the court to enter the plea of not guilty on his behalf, in the same

manner as if he had pleaded not guilty thereto. And when Lhe party
pleads not guilty, or such plea is entered as aforesaid, the cause shall
be deemed at issue, and shall, without further form or ceremony, be
tried by a jury.

Opinion of the Court.

fendant (petitioner) might waive trial by jury, if he so
elected, and have judgment entered against him pursuant
to the provisions of § 97 of Title II.1
The court then asked petitioner if he was guilty or not
guilty of the crime. Petitioner stood mute, refused to
plead, elected to stand on his demurrer and have judgment
rendered against him in accordance with § 97. He was
then adjudged guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for
five years for each of the offenses, to run concurrently, the
entire sentence to be completed at the end of five years.
Judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
202 Fed. Rep. 457.
The first question in the case is whether § 43 of Title II
of the Alaskan Criminal Code applies or § 1024 of the
Revised Statutes. They read, respectively, as follows:
"SEC. 43. That the indictment must charge but one
crime, and in one form only; except that where the crime
may be committed by use of different means the indictment may allege the means in the alternative." 30 Stat.
1290.
"SEC. 1024. When there are several charges against any
person for the same act. or transaction, or for two or more
acts or transactions connected together, or for two or more
acts or transactions of the same class of crimes or offenses,
which may be properly joirLed, instead of having several
indictments, the whole may be joined in one indictment
in separate counts; and if two or more indictments are
found in such cases, the court may order them to be consolidated."
The trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held, as
we have seen, that § 1024 applied, and this is the contenSEC. 97. That if the demurrer be disallowed, the court must permit
the defendant, at his election, to plead, which he must do forthwith,
oF at such time as the court may allow; but if he do not plead, judgment must be given against him. 30 Stat. 1295.

tion of the Government. - Petitioner asserts the applicability of § 43 of the Alaskan Code.
The trial court expressed its recognition of the difference between a district and circuit court of the United
States and a territorial court, such as the District Court
of Alaska was expressed to be, but was of opinion that
when the latter court exercises jurisdiction to enforce the
laws of the United States, "not only the substantive law
but the machinery, the procedure which enables the court
to enforce the substantive law," applied. The Circuit
Court of Appeals, in a circumstantial opinion, reached the
same general result and considered that the Alaskan Code,
by its title and some of its provisions, explicitly specialized
the crimes relating to Alaska and the procedure applicable
to them. The title of the act is, it was said, "An Act to
define and punish crimes in the District of Alaska, and to
provide a code of criminal procedure for said district";
the enacting clause is, "That the penal and criminal laws
of the United States of America and the procedure thereunder relating to the District of Alaska shall be as follows,"
and § 2, c. 1, Title 1, provides "That the crimes and offenses defined in this Act committed within the District
of Alaska shall be punished as herein provided." It was
hence concluded that as the offense charged in the indictment was not one mentioned in the Alaskan Code, it was
not one to be governed by the local procedure but was left
under the procedure prescribed in § 1024 of the Revised
Statutes. The conclusion was fortified by a consideration
of the genesis of the respective provisions. The result of
the conclusion will be the existence of a dual procedure in
the prosecution of different crimes committed within the
same territorial jurisdiction. The result may have examples but it is certainly undesirable, and the systematic
character of the Alaskan Code indicates a contrary intention.
Section 43 is a continuation of the procedure that had

SUMMERS v. UNITED STATES.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

been prescribed for Alaska. , The act providing a civil
government for that Territory, passed May 17, 1884,
c. 53, § 7, 23 Stat. 24, 25 and 26, made the general laws
of Oregon applicable to it, and those laws require "that
the indictment must charge but one crime and in one form
only." It is contended, however, that the laws of Oregon
were declared to be the law of Alaska only in so far as
they were applicable and not in conflict with the laws of
the United States, and that necessarily the provision
above-quoted in regard to the indictment was in conflict
with § 1024 of the Revised Statutes. And it is further
contended that the conflict is not reconciled, or rather that
the difference in procedure is not removed, by § 43 of the
Alaskan Code. We concede strength to these considerations but there are countervailing ones.
The Alaskan Code is quite an elaborate code of substantive and adjective law, the former containing twelve
chapters of definitions of offenses against the person and
property, the public safety and the public peace; the other
containing elaborate and circumstantial provisions for the
indictment and trial of offenders, their sentence and punishment, and a provision for appellate review. It seems to
omit nothing of circumstance or detail necessary to a careful and advanced procedure. But its enumeration of offenses does not include all crimes against the United States,
does not include the one under review, and it is hence contended that the procedure prescribed does not apply to
the crimes not enumerated, and therefore, does not apply
to the crime under review. In other,words, it is contended
that the procedure prescribed is complementary only to
the crimes defined and has no broader application, leaving
all other crimes to be governed by § 1024 of the Revised
Statutes.
It is established that the courts of the Territories may
have such jurisdiction of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the cir-

231 U. S.

cuit and district courts, but this does not make them circuit
and district courts of the United States. It has been hence
decided that the manner of impaneling grand juries prescribed for the circuit and district courts does not apply
to the territorial courts. Reynolds v. United States, 98
U. S. 145, 154. See, as to trial juries, Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434. In the latter case it was said "that
the whole subject matter of jurors in the Territories is
committed to territorial regulation" (p. 445).
This principle was applied to the mode of challenging
petit jurors, Miles v. United States, 103 U. S.304; to give
defendants the right to separate trials and for the regulation of peremptory challenges to jurors, Cochran et al. v.
United States (Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit),
147 Fed. Rep. 206, 207. In Fitzpatrick v. United States,
178 U. S.304, 307-8, it was said that the laws of Oregon
must be looked to for the requisites of an indictment for
murder rather than the rules of the common law. And
this by virtue of the act providing a civil government for
Alaska, presently referred to. See also Thiede v. Utah
Territory, 159 U. S.510.
In the case at bar there is direct legislation by Congress.
Does the principle apply in such case? The first legislation for Alaska was an act of May 17, 1884, entitled "An
Act providing civil government for Alaska," § 7 of which
was as follows: "That the general laws of the State of
Oregon now in force are hereby declared to be the law in
said district so far as the same may be applicable and not
in conflict with the provisions of this act or the laws of the
United States." Chapter 53, 23 Stat. 25, 26. But what
constitutes conflict? Mere difference, the Court of Appeals decided, citing Kie v. United States, 27 Fed. Rep.
351, 356. That, however, depends upon the purpose.
Congress was legislating directly for Alaska; manifestly
intended to distinguish it and intended the laws of Oregon
to be its laws, regarding them as more suitable to its con-

SUMMERS v. UNITED STATES.
231 U..S.

Opinion of the Court.

ditions than general laws determined by or addressed to
different conditions. See United States v. Pridgeon, 153
U. S. 48. And this appears to have been the view taken
by the court in other cases.
In Endleman V. United States, 86 Fed. Rep. 456, the
laws of Oregon were referred to to sustain an indictment
to which a demurrer had been filed on the ground that it
contained only one count and that several distinct offenses
were charged in that count. The case, however, may be
said to have only negative value in the discussion. It
referred to the Criminal Code as constituting the law of
the district but did not refer to or base the decision on
that provision which required an indictment to charge
"one crime and in one form only." The law of Oregon
necessarily was decided to be controlling.
In Jackson v. United States, 102 Fed. Rep. 413, 477, the
court resorted to the laws of Oregon to determine the
qualifications of grand jurors, considering them as applicable under the organic act providing' a civil government for the Territory.
In Corbus v. Leonhardt, 11.4 Fed. Rep. 10, the court refused to apply § 858 of the Revised Statutes which provides that in actions by or against executors and administrators neither party shall be allowed to testify against
the other, and applied instead the law of Oregon permitting
such testimony. And this by virtue of the provision of
the act already cited making the laws of Oregon the laws
of Alaska.
In Ball v. United States, 1.47 Fed. Rep. 32, 36, it was
assigned as error that the trial court overruled the motion
of Ball to require the district attorney to furnish him a
list of all of the witnesses to be produced against him on
the trial in accordance with § 1033 of the Revised Statutes. It was held that the section applied only to the
trial of treason and capital cases in the courts of the
United States. The court said, "The present case was

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

tried in a territorial court under the Penal Code and Code
of Criminal Procedure of Alaska. Those codes contain no
requirement that a list of witnesses be furnished the accused upon demand or othei'wise." Thiede v. Utah, 159
U. S. 510, 514, was cited as holding that § 1033 does not
control practice and procedure in territorial courts.
These cases in the Court of Appeals apply the principle
of the cases in this court, which we have cited, that Congress by its legislation intends always special regulations
for the Territories, to be exercised, it may be, through
territorial legislatures or, as in the case of Alaska, by making the laws of Oregon the laws of Alaska, and subsequently by the cQde enacted for that Territory.
It is, however, the contention, as we have seen, that the
limitations of the title of the Alaskan Codes and the
omission from them of the crime under review make
§ 1024 applicable, or, to state it differently, make §43
of Title II of the Code, which provides that "the indictment must charge but one crime and in one form only,"
applicable only to the crimes and offenses specifically defined in the act. If it be true that there is such limitation,
it would follow that if the laws of Oregon were, before the
enactment of the codas, applicable to other offenses in
Alaska, they are still applicable. But we are not disposed
so to limit the procedure in Alaska. It is, as we have said,
very complete and circumstantial. It covers every step
in a criminal proceeding, the first accusation, arrest, preliminary inquiry of guilt, duties of officers and magistrates,
formation of grand juries, the indictment, trial and its
conduct, verdict, sentence and judgment. The reason
given for denying its application seems to us not adequate.
It is said that § 1024 was originally contained in the act of
February 26, 1853, c. 80, 10 Stat. 161, to regulate the fees
of clerks, marshals and attorneys of the courts of the
United States, and finally became § 823 of the Revised
Statutes and by it made applicable to all of the States and

SUMMERS v. UNITED STATES.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Territories. And it is said that the purpose of the act of
1853 and its continuance was to prevent the officers of the
United States from increasing their fees by filing separate
indictments when the offenses might be properly charged
in one. But such a general purpose might easily be considered as yielding to the special provisions for Alaska
expressed in the laws of OrEgon and declared to be the
law of Alaska and in the repetition of the provisions of
those laws in the Code of Alaska, that but one offense
shall be charged in the indictment. We cannot suppose
that the purpose of regulating the fees of officers was more
essential and dominant than that special provision, to
have no effect as to the great body of crimes of ordinary
and everyday commission defined in the Code, and yet
apply to offenses less frequent.
By an act of the territorial legislature, approved
April 26, 1913, c. 39, Session Laws, 1913, § 43 was amended
so as to permit the joinder of two or more offenses or
crimes of the same class in one indictment in separate
counts, and it is hence contended by the Government that
the act makes valid the indictment in the case at bar. It
is therefore insisted that "the only result of a reversal will
therefore be that petitioner will be re-tried under the
present indictment or under a new indictment identical
in form." If the trial court erred, it is further insisted,
the error has become immaterial.
We are not disposed to give the act retrospective operation, so as to give validity to indictments found before its
enactment, assuming for the argument's sake that it could
have been given such operation. The evil of so considering
it is manifest. Petitioner stood on his demurrer in reliance
upon the then existing law, and fault cannot be imputed
to him for doing so. Had the law been different his pleading might have been different, and instead of submitting to
judgment he might have contested the charges against
him. This is certainly a substantial right. The Govern-

ment seems to urge that he was in fault for not contesting
the charges and by not doing so took all chances of the
change of the law, and that besides, it is urged, he received
no greater sentence than must have been imposed on a
conviction of one crime only, as the minimum sentence
under § 5209 is five years. It is contended that the principle that one good count will support a judgment is applicable. But this overlooks the right of petitioner to have
defended against the indictment, the right which, we repeat, he did not lose by pleading its defects under the then
existing law.
It is contended by petitioner that the trial court in imposing sentence and judgment upon him denied him the
constitutional right of trial by jury, and that, the offenses
charged against him being felonies, he was without power
to waive a jury trial. Of this contention, we are not required to express opinion, having found the indictment
against him insufficient.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded to the District
Court for the District of Alaska, Division No. 1, with
directions to sustain the demurrer to the indictment.

ALZUA v. JOHNSON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
No. 306.

Motion to affirm submitted October 27, 1913.-Decided
November 10, 1913.

This court is slow to revise the judgment of the highest court of a
Territory on matters of local administration.
Judges of United States courts are not liable to civil actions for their
judicial acts. Bradley,v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335.
The principle of immunity of judges from civil action for their official
acts is so deep seated in the system of American jurisprudence that
this court will regard it having been carried into the Philippine Islands as soon as the American courts were established therein.
