DELAWARE, LACKAWANNA AND WESTERN
RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DIQTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 275.

Argued October 17, 193..-Decided December 1, 1913.

The commodity clause of the Hepburn Act applies not only to the
carrier's goods from point of production to the market but also to
goods from market to that point.
While the power to regulate interstfite commerce is subject to the provisions of the Fifth Amendment, an enactment, such as the commodity clause, which does not take property or arbitrarily deprive the
carrier of a property right, does not violate that Amendment.
In dealing with interstate carriers, the fact that some of them are also
engaged in private business doeS not compel Congress to legislate
concerning them as carriers in such manner as not to interfere with
such private business.
The commodity clause is general and applies to all shipments, even if
innocent in themselves, which come within its scope; its operation
is not confined to particular instances in which the carriers might
use its power to the prejudice of shippers. Supplies, purchased for
use in operating a carrier's mines, 75% of the product of which is
intended for sale and only 25% intended for the carrier's own use,
are not necessary for the conduct of its business as a carrier and
fall within the prohibition of the commodity clause of the Hepburn
Act.
Although the purchaser may have the right to rescind for a condition
subsequent, title may pass on delivery; and so held in this case that
title to hay purchased by, and delivered to, a railroad company,
passed to it although payment was postponed until after inspection
and acceptance.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Commodities Clause of the Hepburn Act of June 29, 1906, are
stated in the opinion.

Company during the transportation thereof from Black
Rock to Scranton. The title to said hay did not pass to
the Railroad Company until it accepted the hay after
an inspection thereof at the mines.
The acceptance of goods by a buyer is necessary to
completely transfer the title. 35 Cyc. 306; Hershiser v.

Where there is a contract to sell unascertained goods,
no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer until
the goods are ascertained (except in the case of a contract
to sell an undivided share of goods). See § 17 of the
Sales Act; Williston on Sales, § 258.
In every case the appropriation must have the assent
of both parties, to transfer the property in the goods.
See Williston on Sales, §§ 274, 277, 278; Mechem on Sales,
§§ 721, 724, 726, 729, 730; Blackburn on Sales, p. 129;
Benjamin on Sales, 5th ed., pp. 241, 346,
When the seller is required by the contract to deliver
the goods to the buyer at some particular place, the presumption is, unless a contrary intention appears, that the
property in the goods does not pass until the goods are
delivered to the buyer at that place, and accepted by him.
See § 19, Rule 5, of the Uniform Sales Act. See also Williston on Sales, § 280; Mechem on Sales, §§ 733, 736; Benjamin on Sales, 5th ed., p. 355; Braddock Glass Co. v.

Assuming, however, that the Railroad Company owned
the hay in question during the transportation thereof
over its railroad from Black Rock to Scranton, the Commodities Clause, in its application to such transportation,
was unconstitutional because it deprived the Railroad
Company of its liberty and property without due process
of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
The question here presented has not been passed upon
by this court and was not covered by Commodities Cases,
213 U. S. 366.
The power to regulate commerce among the States is
limited by the Fifth Amendment. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1; Monongahela Nay. Co. v. UnitedStates, 148 U. S.
336; McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27; Adair v.
United States, 208 U. S. 161.
The limitations imposed by the Fifth Amendment upon
the exercise by Congress of the power to regulate commerce are the same as those imposed by the Fourteenth
Amendment upon the exercise of the police power by the
state legislatures. Freund, Police Power, §§ 65, 66; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 101; Carroll v. Greenwich
Ins. Co., 199 U. S. 401, 410.
The Fifth Amendment forbids Congress, in the exercise
of the power to regulate commerce, to arbitrarily, unreasonably or unnecessarily interfere with individual
rights of liberty and property. The Commodities Clause
is an arbitrary, unreasonable and unnecessary interference
with such rights, and has no reasonable relation to the accomplishment of any legitimate public object. Union
Bridge Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. 364; Lochner v.
New York, 198 U. S. 45; Martin v. District of Columbia,

Commission, 206 U. S. 1, 20; Hudson County Water Co. v.
McCarter, 209 U. S. 349.
The Commodities Clause, in its application to the facts
of this case, is arbitrary, unreasonable and unnecessary,
in that it has no reasonable relation to the accomplishment of any legitimate public object. For the legislative
history of the act, see Haddock v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co.,
4 I. C. C. 296, and Coxe v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 4
I. C. C. 535.
The Commodities Clause, in its application to the facts
of this case, deprived the Railroad Company not only of
its liberty but also of property. Allgeyer v. Louisiana,
165 U. S. 589; New Haven R. R. Co. v. Int. Comm. Comm.,
200 U. S. 361.
The last case cited undoubtedly pointed the way to
Congress in the enactment of the Commodities Clause.
Cong. Rec., Vol. 40, pp. 6618-23, 6680-86, 6693, 6757
and 6758.
The history of the act shows that the discrimination
which it was the purpose of Congress in enacting the
Commodities Clause to stamp out was that which a railroad company could cover up and conceal by the commingled accounts of the two kinds of business, commercial
and transportation, and not the transportation by a
railroad company of materials lawfully purchased and
owned by it, not for sale, but for use in the operation of
property owned by it.
That kind of discrimination is entirely absent from such
transportation. It cannot exist in connection therewith,
because the Railroad Company does not deal commercially
in the commodities so transported.
In this case the transportation by a railroad company
of its own commodities to its mines for use in the operation thereof, is free from any evil that might justify the
absolute prohibition of such transportation in the public
interest.

231 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

In fact, it is a matter o complete indifference to the
public, and every individual shipper, and every one of its
competitors in the coal business whether or not the Railroad Company does or does not engage in such transportation, so long as it continues lawfully to own and
operate its mines, and the Commodities Clause in prohibiting such transportation has no reasonable relation to the
accomplishment of any legitimate public object, but is
arbitrary, unreasonable and. unnecessary and violates the
Fifth Amendment.

MR. JusucE LAMAR

delivered the opinion of the court.

The Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company was indicted for hauling, over its lines, between
Buffalo, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, twenty
carloads of hay, belonging to the Company, but not necessary for its use as a common carrier. This transportation

DEL., LACK. & WEST. R. E,. v. UNITED STATES. 369

Opinion of the Court.

was charged to be in violation of the Commodities Clause
of the Hepburn Act, June. 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat.
585, which makes it unlawful "for any railroad company
to transport in interstate commerce any article ...
it may own . .
or in -which it may have any interest . . . except such
.
as may be necessary . . . for its use in the conduct of its business as
a common carrier."
On the trial it appeared that the defendant was not only
chartered as a Railroad, but had also been authorized
to operate coal mines. The hay, referred to in the indictment, had been purchased for the use of animals employed
in and about the mines at Scranton-all the coal taken
therefrom being sold for use by the public, except the
steam coal which was used as fuel for the Company's
locomotives.
The defendant was found guilty and sentenced on each
of the twenty counts. It brought the case here, insisting
that the Commodities Clause violated the Fifth Amendment; deprived the Company of a right to contract, and
prevented it from carrying its own property needed in a
legitimate intrastate business, conducted under authority
of a charter granted by the State of Pennsylvania, many
years before the adoption of the Hepburn Bill.
1. This contention must be overruled on the authority
of United States v. Delaware &c. Co., 213 U. S. 366, 416.
It is true that the decision in that case related to shipments of coal from mine to market, while here the merchandise was transported from market to mine. But
the statute relates to "all commodities, except lumber,
owned by the Company" aad includes inbound as well as
outbound shipments. Both classes of transportation are
within the purview of the eil to be corrected and, therefore, subject to the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. The exercise of that power is, of course,
limited by the provisions of the Fifth Amendment.
VOL. ccxxxi-24

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

(Monongahela Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 336;
McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27; Union Bridge Co.
v. United States, 204 U. S. 364), but the Commodities
Clause does not take property nor' does it arbitrarily
deprive the Company of a right of property. The statute
deals with railroad companies as public carriers, and the
fact that they may also be engaged in a private business
does not compel Congress to legislate concerning them
as carriers so as not to interfere with them as miners or
merchants. If such carrier hauls for the public and also
for its own private purposes, there is an opportunity to
discriminate in favor of itself against other shippers in the
rate charged, the facility furnished or the quality of the
service rendered. The Commodities Clause was not an
unreasonable and arbitrary prohibition against a railroad
company transporting its own useful property, but a
constitutional exercise of a governmental power intended
to cure or prevent the evils that might result if, in hauling goods in or out, the Company occupied the dual
and inconsistent position of public carrier and private
shipper.
It was suggested that the case is not within the statute
because, as the Company could buy, in Scranton, hay that
had already been transported over its line, no possible
harm could come to anyone if it brought the same hay at
Buffalo and then hauled it to Scranton for use at the mine,
but not for sale in competition with other dealers in stock
food. But the courts are not concerned with the question
as to whether, in a particular case, there had been any
discrimination against shippers or harm to other dealers.
The statute is general and applies not only to those particular instances in which the carrier did use its power to
the prejudice of the shipper, but to all shipments which,
however innocent in themselves, come within the scope
and probability of the evil to be prevented.
2. In this case the hay was purchased for use in operat-

Opinion of the Court.

ing mines where 75 per cent. of the coal produced was
"assorted sizes" intended to be sold for domestic purposes.
The remaining 25 per cent. was steam coal-all of which
was used as fuel on the Company's locomotives. This
steam coal was in the nature. of a by-product from a mine
operated primarily for the purpose of obtaining coal for
sale. Hay purchased for use in such mining cannot be
said to have been necessary for the use of the Company
in the conduct of its business as a common carrier.
3. Lastly, it was contended that the hay did not belong
to the Railroad Company at the time of the transportation
and, therefore, the conviction should be set aside since the
statute only prohibits the hauling of commodities owned
by the carrier.
This contention is based upon the terms of the contract,
by which the Vassar Company, of Millington, Michigan,
agreed to sell to the Railroad Company 3,000 tons, No. 1,
timothy hay, at $15.40 per ton, f. o. b. Buffalo, payment
to be made as follows: Upon the delivery of the hay to the
purchaser, at Buffalo, same will be transported by the
purchaser to various points on its line of railroad to be determined by the purchaser, at which places the purchaser
shall have the right to inspect such hay before acceptande,
and if upon such inspection said hay shall prove to be
of the kind specified, the purchaser shall accept such hay
and pay for the same within 30 days after such acceptance. Each of the twenty carloads of hay mentioned
in the indictment was received by the Company at Buffalo. Each was then reconsigned to itself at Scranton.
The waybills were marked "Freight free-Co. use."
After arrival at Scranton !it was inspected, accepted and
used.
On these facts the defendant insists that the title did
not pass until after acceptance, and many authorities
are cited to support the proposition that, in a contract for
the sale of personal property not only delivery by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

seller, but acceptance by the buyer, is necessary for the
transfer of title. But there are two kinds of acceptanceone of quality and the other of title. They are not necessarily contemporaneous. There may be an acceptance of
quality before delivery, as where goods are selected by
the purchaser-delivery and transfer of- title being postponed until a later time. Or, there may be an acceptance of title without an acceptance of quality; so that
in many cases, after the title has passed, the purchaser
may recover damages if the goods, upon inspection, prove
to be of a quality inferior to that ordered. Day v. Pool,
52 N. Y. 416; Zabriskie v. Central R. R., 131 N. Y. 72;
Bagley v. Cleveland Co., 21 Fed. Rep. 159 (3), 164; Miller
v. Moore, 83 Georgia, 684. Again, though there may
be such an acceptance as will transfer the title, the purchaser may, under the contract, have the right to rescind, as for a condition subsequent, if the goods do not
correspond with the specifications. Such was the case
here. When the hay was received by the purchaser at
Buffalo there was such an acceptance as to transfer title
to the Railroad, which accordingly took possession and
exercised control, in fixing when and to what point on its
line the hay should be shipped. Title prima facie passes
when delivery is made and if such possession followed by
acts of ownership did not trv isfer the title to the Railroad Company, it left the risk of unknown dangers, at
unknown points, for an indefinite time, upon the seller.
So hard and unusual an incident is not, under facts like
these, necessarily to be implied from the use of the ambiguous phrase, "pay after inspection and acceptance,"
and no such construction should be given unless demanded
by the explicit terms of the contract. The parties, by
their conduct, showed that they did not understand that
the hay remained the property of the seller after it had
been delivered to the buyer, for the hay after being received was consigned by the Company to itself and went

Syllabus.

forward from Buffalo to Scranton on waybills containing
the entry "Freight free-Company use." If the hay did,
in fact, then belong to the Vassar Company, such a shipment on such a waybill would have been a departure
from the published tariff, contrary to the provisions of the
Act to Regulate Commerce. No such offense however was

committed, for the contract., both by its terms and in the
light of the conduct of the parties, meant that the title
should pass when delivery was accepted by the defendant at Buffalo, but that the Railroad Company might
rescind if, on later inspection, the quality was found to
be different from what had been described in the contract
of sale. But after such delivery and before such rescission,
the title was in the Railroad Company. Allen v. Maury,
66 Alabama, 10; Burrows v. Whitaker, 71 N. Y. 291;
Kuppenheimer v. Wertheimer, 107 Michigan, 77.

As the

hay belonged to the defendant and was intended for use
in its private business of mining, the transportation over
its lines, in interstate commerce, was a violation of the
Commodity Clause.
Judgment affirmed.
