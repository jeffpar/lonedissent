NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK v. HOTCHKISS, AS TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF HASKINS.
HOTCHKISS, AS TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF
HASKINS, v. NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW
YORK.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

Nos. 459, 460. Argued October 17, 20, 1913.-Decided November 3, 1913.
Courts may go far in giving financial transactions between banks and
customers any form which will carry out the mutually understood
intent, Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90; but if the intent is doubtful
or inconsistent with the legal effect of dominant facts it will fail.
An understanding that the proceeds of a loan made by a bank to a customer and placed to the credit of his general account are to be used
to take up certain securities does not, in the absence of any special
agreement to that effect, create a lien upon those securities, and the
delivery of such securities to the bank with notice of the customer's
impending insolvency is an illegal preference under the Bankruptcy
Act.
A trust cannot be established in an aliquot share of a man's whole
property, as distinguished from a particular fund, by showing that
trust monies have gone into it.
I
Although a loan may be made for a specified purpose, if the lender
places it in the stream of the borrower's general property there is no
right of subrogation.
A general creditor may increase the bankrupt's estate by his advances
and lose the right to take them back.
Time may sometimes be disregarded when it is insignificant, but not
where it has sufficed to materially change the financial positions of
the parties.
These cases are distinguished from Gorman v. Littlefield, 229 U. S. 19,
and other cases in which there was a specific res which identified the
fund and separated it from the general mass of the estate.
A notice to a bank demanding securities for a loan made to the bank-

rupt that bankruptcy was impending and that it was receiving a
preference is sufficient to show that the bank had cause to believe
that it was obtaining a preference.
Under an agreement, made in a suit by a receiver against a bank to
recover securities in specie as an illegal preference, that the bank
should hold them pending the decision of the suit with a power to
sell in its discretion which had not been exercised, held that the bank
was only liable for the securitic and not for their value at the time
the agreement was made.
201 Fed. Rep. 664; 120 C. C. A. 92, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the determination of whether
the delivery of securities by a broker, immediately preceding his bankruptcy, to a bank to secure its loan was

an illegal preference, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John A. Garver for appellant in No. 459 and for
appellee in No. 460:
The law presumes an agreement or transaction to be
legal, when it is capable of a construction which makes
it valid. Jones on Evidence (2d ed.), § 85; King v. Hawkins, 10 East, 211; Curtis v. Gokey, 68 N. Y. 300, 304;
Ormes v. Dauchy, 82 N. Y. 443.
So as to securing a just debt. Getts v. Janesville Co., 163
Fed Rep. 417; Re Neill Co., 170 Fed. Rep. 481, 484; Re
Leech, 171 Fed. Rep. 622; Sexton v. Kessler, 172 Fed. Rep.
535, 537.
The right to recover a preference is exclusively statutory.
The common law favors the diligent creditor. Tompkins
v. Hunter, 149 N. Y. 117, 121; Dodge v. McKechnie, 156
N. Y. 514, 520; Huntley v. Kingman, 152 U. S.527, 532.
A trustee in bankruptcy has, therefore, no power to
avoid a preference, except on the precise grounds specified
in the statute; and, as the right given is in derogation of
the common law, it must be strictly pursued. Plowden,
Comm. 113; Sutherland, Stat. Con., § 371; Atkins v. Kinnan, 20 Wend. 241, 249, 250.

A remedy which is given by statute must be strictly followed. East Tenn. &c. R. Co. v. Southern Tel. Co., 112
U. S. 306, 310; Campbellsville Lumber Co. v. Hubbert, 112
Fed. Rep. 718, 724-750; affd., 191 U. S. 70; Matter of Bryce,
16 Daly, 443.
A transaction, such as this, which does not diminish the
fund distributable among the creditors is not repugnant
to the statute. County Bank v. Massey, 192 U. S. 138, 147;
Bank of Newport v. Herkimer Bank, 225 U. S. 178, 184;
Gorman v. Littlefield, 229 U. S. 19, 25; Continental Trust
Co. v. Chicago Title Co., 229 U. S. 435.
This rule applies even where the account is not active
and where two payments have been made without any
intermediate sale. Re Sagor, 121 Fed. Rep. 658; Jaquith
v. Alden, 189 U. S. 78; Yaple v. Dahl-Milliken Co., 193
U. S. 526; Wild v. Provident Trust Co., 214 U. S. 292, 296.
There are no other creditors of the same class.
A payment is objectionable under § 60 only when it has
the effect of enabling one creditor to obtain a greater
percentage of his claim than other creditors of the same
class. Swartz v. Fourth Natl. Bank, 117 Fed. Rep. 1;
Crooks v. People's Bank, 46 App. Div. 335.
The classification referred to in § 60a is not the same as
that providing for a priority in the payment of debts in
§ 64b. As to differences in classification, see Re Belknap,
129 Fed. Rep. 646; Re Barrett, 6 Am. Bkcy. Rep. 199;

Rep. 219, 221; Gomila v. Wilcombe, 151 Fed. Rep. 470.
There is no proof that the bankrupts intended to give
preference.
Prior to the amendment of 1910, the trustee in bankruptcy was required to prove, in a suit of this kind, that
the aeditor knew that the bankrupt actually intended to
give a preference. Hardy v. Gray, 144 Fed. Rep. 992;

amendment, see Alexander v. Redmond, 180 Fed. Rep. 192,
and cases cited in brief for appellant, in Mechanics Bank
v. Ernst (post, p. 64).
Defendant did not have reasonable cause to believe it
was obtaining a preference. Irish v. Citizens' Trust Co.,
163 Fed. Rep. 880.
The conduct of defendant's officers in asking for the
securities on that day is entirely consistent with the understanding and usage of the business, and is in direct accord,
with the written contract, that clearance loans shall be
taken care of before the close of business hours.
Subrogation exists. The tendency is to extend subrogation to every possible case for the protection of one advancing money for discharging obligations carrying security.
Matthews v. Fidelity Title Co., 52 Fed. Rep. 687, 689.
Subrogation is allowed in every instance in which one
party pays a debt for which another is primarily liable, and
which, in equity and good conscience, the latter should
have discharged. Stevens v. King, 84 Maine, 291; Dunlop
v. Adams, 174 N. Y. 411, 416; Atlaniic Trust Co. v. Kinderhook Co.,'17 App. Div. 212; Louis v. Bauer, 33 App. Div.

Equity will not permit technicalities or even serious obstacles to stand in the way of the enforcement of the
principle of subrogation. Peters v. Meyer, 72 App. Div.
585; Gans v. Thieme, 93 N. Y. 225; Pease v. Egan, 131
N. Y. 262; Cobb v. Dyer, 69 Maine, 494.
It is not necessary that the person to be subrogated
should pay the creditor directly. It is sufficient if he advances the money for the purpose of enabling the debtor
to pay the debt. Building Assn. v. Thompson, 32 N. J.

The proceeds of the loan constituted a trust fund.
Sexton v. Kessler, 172 Fed. Rep. 535, 544.
This loan was made in conformity with an established
custom between banks and their broker customers. A
general custom is the common law itself, or a part of it;
even written contracts will yield to such custom. Walls

§ 150.
There was a special fund held by the bankrupts for a
specific purpose, to be used in protecting and enhancing
the value of the general assets, and having, consequently,
such character that no general creditor could claim any
right to share in it. Gorman v. Littlefield, 229 U. S. 19, 25;

MR. JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover
certain securities alleged to have been transferred to the

Opinion of the Court.

defendant bank by way of preference. The plaintiff had
a judgment in the District Court, 200 Fed. Rep. 287, id.
299, and in the Circuit Court of Appeals, 201 Fed. Rep.
664; 120 C. C. A. 92. Both parties appeal; the plaintiff
upon a subordinate question as to its right to elect damages instead of a return of the securities.
The case arose upon what is known in New York as a
clearance loan. Brokers need large sums to clear or pay
for the stocks that they receive in the course of the day,
and as the stocks must be paid for before they are received
and can be pledged to raise the necessary funds, these
sums are advanced by the banks. They are returned
later on the same day by making deposits to the borrower's
account and drawing a check to the order of the bank.
Perhaps such a general cowse of dealing might be arranged so as to give a lien on the loan or its proceeds
until payment, but the question whether such a lien has
been created rarely, if ever, has arisen, the whole business
being finished in a few hours. It is, however, the main
issue in this case.
The bankrupts were brokers in partnership and at ten
o'clock on January 19, 1910, had assets exceeding their
liabilities by nearly half a million dollars. These assets consisted largely in the stock of a coal and iron company in
which there was a pool. Before twelve, there was a break
in the market, the stock went down and at about noon the
suspension of the firm was announced. A petition in
involuntary bankruptcy was filed at ten minutes after
four on the same day. At about ten, the bank made
a clearance loan to the bankrupts of $500,000 in the usual
way to enable them to meet their current obligations and
to get the stocks deliverable: on that day, the bank receiving demand notes and both parties acting in good
faith. The sum was credited in the deposit account of the
firm, in addition to $54,319.98 already there, and soon after
the bank certified and subsequently paid checks amounting

to $535,920.74. During the day the firm made deposits
which are not in question, but there remained due upon
the loan $166,166.69. Officers of the bank noticing the
drop in the stock went to the firm, demanded payment
or securities to make good the obligations to the bank,
and were told of the suspension and that a petition in
bankruptcy would be filed. After two hours discussion
the securities in question were delivered between 2 and 3
p. m., but the officers were told that the delivery was a
preference. Some of the securities bore no relation to
the loan; others and, it may be assumed for purposes of
argument, most, had been released by the money thus
obtained.
In dealing with transactions of this kind we may go far
in giving them any form that will carry out the mutually
understood intent. Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90, 96, 97.
But if the intent was doubtful or inconsistent with the
legal effect of dominant facts, it must fail. For instance,
apart from possible exceptions, a man cannot retain a
domicil in one place when he has moved to another and
intends to reside there for the rest of his life, by any wish,
declaration or intent inconsistent with the dominant facts
of where he actually lives and what he actually means to
do. Dickinson v. Brookline, 181 Massachusetts, 195. In
the present case it is agreed that it was expected and understood that no portion of the clearance loan was to be used
for any purpose other than to clear securities. But on the
other hand, by consent of the bank as it seems, the loan
was put into the general deposit account, which was drawn
upon for general purposes, at least to the extent of the
balance above the loan; the securities released were not
kept separate but were used like any others; and no separate account was kept of money received from deliveries
of stock so released. What happened as between these
parties was simply that all monies received in the course
of the day from whatever source went into the firm's

Opinion of the Court.

deposit account with the bank. So that, even if we take it,
as a corollary of what was understood, that the use of the
clearance loan was expected to enable the firm to repay
the lean, it does not appear to have been expected that the
proceeds should be appropriated specifically to that end,
but simply that the addition of such proceeds to the general
funds of the firm would enable the latter to pay within
the time allowed. This is the view of the facts taken by
the master and both of the courts below. They also found
that an attempt to give the matter a different complexion
by custom had failed; and if we went behind their findings
we should take the same view.
A trust cannot be established in an aliquot share of a
man's whole property, as -distinguished from a particular
fund, by showing that trust monies have gone into it.. On
similar principles a lien cannot be asserted upon a fund in
a borrower's hands, which at an earlier stage might have
been subject to it, if by consent of the claimant it has
become a part of the borrower's general estate. But that
was the result of the dealings between these parties, and it
cannot be done away with by a wish or intention, if such
there was, that alongside of this permitted freedom of
dealing on the part of the bankrupts, the security of the
bank should persist. It is not like the case of property
wrongfully mingled with general funds and afterwards
traced. All that the parties agreed either expressly or by
implication was that the debt incurred at ten o'clock
should be paid by three. Some banks seem to have required the dealing to be conducted on the footing of a fund
identified and subject to a trust at every step, but between
these parties there was no attempt to follow a specific
fund through a series of changes until it was returned.
See Dillon v. Barnard,21 Wall. 430.
As all trace of the bank's money was lost when it entered
the stream of the firm's general property there can be no
right of subrogation. Neither can a claim be upheld on

the ground that there was no diminution of the bankrupt's
assets, or that the transaction should be regarded as instantaneous and one. The consent to become a general
creditor for an hour, that was imported, even if not intended to have that effect, by the liberty allowed to the
firm, broke the continuity arid established the loan as
part of the assets. No doubt many general creditors have
increased a bankruptrs estate by their advances, but they
have lost the right to take them back. Time sometimes
can be disregarded when it is insignificant. But in this
case half the time between the loan and the transfer of
securities sufficed to change the position of the borrowers
from a fortune of half a million to a deficit of double that
amount.
In both Gorman v. Littlefield, 229 U. S. 19, and Richardson v. Shaw, 209 U. S. 365, in addition to the personality
of the holder there was also a specific stock, which identified the fund relied upon and separated it from the general
mass of the estate. Hurley v. Atchison, Topeka-& Santa
F6 Ry. Co., 213 U. S. 126, stood on the peculiar facts of
the case, which were held to point to an identified res and
give an immediate claim against it. The case established
no general proposition contrary to what we now decide.
The suggestions that it does not appear that the bankrupts intended to give a preference or that the bank
had reasonable cause to believe that it was obtaining
one, hardly need answer. The bank did not confine its
demand to proceeds of the loan but asked for and obtained
securities without regard to their source. Itwas notified
in. terms that it was receiving a preference and that the
firm was going into bankruptcy. If this was not sufficient
notice it is hardp to imagine what would be enough.
The cross appeal depends upon the frame of the bill
and effect of an agreement between the parties. On April5,
1910 it was agreed that the securities in question might
be sold by the bank "at the best price obtainable, at such

NATIONAL CITY BANK v. HOTCHKISS.

Opinion of the Court.

times as may seem best to the officers of" the bank; that
the rights of both parties "shall attach to the proceeds
realized from the sale" and "the amount realized from the
sale of the said securities shall stand in lieu of the securities and shall represent the amount of the liability" of the
bank to the trustee in bankruptcy in case of judgment
against it. "The making of this stipulation shall not alter
the rights or claims of any of the parties, nor change the
jurisdiction of any court . . . it being the intention of
the stipulation that the securities in the possession of the
National City Bank shall be converted into money at the
best prices obtainable, and that all rights' of the parties
shall remain as against the proceeds of the sale of the said
securities the same as they existed against the securities
themselves at the time of making this stipulation."
It seems that no sale took place. The decree was for a
delivery of the securities with all interest and dividends
thereon received and in default thereof for $161,740.62
with interest from the date of the master's report. But as
the securities have declined a good deal below their value
at the time of conversion and again below their value
at the date of the foregoing agreement, the trustee claims
the right to take the sum namned, with corrections. This
was answered sufficiently by Judge Hand in the District
Court. As he observed, the suit was in equity to recover
the securities in specie. After the agreement, the bank
was authorized to hold them until it thought it wise to sell.
If it had sold, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff's
claim would have been limited to the proceeds, by the
words of the contract. Its judgment not to sell, exercised
for the benefit of both parties, cannot have been intended
to put it in a worse position. Such an understanding would
have deprived the plaintiff of the judgment of the bank.
Decree affirmed.
