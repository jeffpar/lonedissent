Statement o the Case.

after the fall and before the harm was done, and a finding
on that ground would not open the questions that have
been discussed; but we have preferred to deal with the case
on the matters principally argued, as they seem to offer
the most obvious reasons foir the verdict, and therefore
have assumed that the jury found the facts and standard

of conduct to be as we have supposed.

Judgment affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 641.

Submitted November 3, 1913.-Decided November 17, 1913.

Unless the statutes of the United States control, this court follows the
state court as to whether real estate is separate or community
property.
Until the title of an entryman is completed the laws of the United
States control; but after completion the land becomes immediately
subject to state legislation. McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382.
Even if the United States could impress a peculiar character upon land
within a State after parting with it, it would only be by clearly expressing it in a statute, which has not been done. Wright v. Morgan,
191 U. S. 55.
A state law that after completion of the entryman's title the property
becomes community property is not like a contract for sale to a third
party; but is consistent, and not in conflict, with the provisions of the
act of March .3, 1891, prohibiting alienation of homestead entries.
The highest court of the State of Washington having held that immediately on completion of title of an entrymaa the property becomes community property, and that on the death of the wife after
such completion her children have an interest therein, this court
follows that decision.

to property acquired by an entryman under the laws of the
United States, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. F. M. Dudley, Mr. W. E. Cullen and Mr. David
Herman for appellant:
The lower court erred in holding that the State of
Washington has uniformly held grants of the Federal
Government under the homestead laws to be the community property of the entryman and his wife. Bolton v.
La Camas Water Co., 10 Washington, 246, held that the
homestead was the separate property of the entryman.
Ahern v. Ahern, 31 Washington, 334, holding otherwise,
was disapproved in Hall v. Hall, 41 Washington, 186, and
Cunningham v. Krutz, 41 Washington, 190.
Since the Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision
herein, the Supreme Court of Washington has held these
cases to be out of harmony and irreconcilable. Teynor v.
Heible, 133 Pac. Rep. 1.
To allow the States to ignore Federal land laws, to
interpret the grants made by the Federal Government and
designate the persons who are the beneficiaries thereof
according to their own local laws, brings about the anomalous situation of citizens of the United States holding
different rights under grants issued by the Federal Government in pursuance of the same and identical laws,
simply because one happens to live in one State and
the other in another State. California, also possessing
the community property law, has uniformly held that the
homestead becomes the sole and separate property of the
entryman. Noe v. Cord, 14 California, 577; Wilson v.
Castro,31 California, 421; Wood v. Hamilton, 33 California,
698; Lake v. Lake, 52 California, 428; Harris v. Harris,
71 California, 314; Morgan v. Lones, 80 California, 317.
The State of Washington has been vacillating and
under certain conditions holds that the homestead is not
the separate, property of the entryman, but the com-

munity property of himself and his wife, and that onehalf of the property belongs to her or her children, even
if they are by a former husband.
The State cannot confiscate one-half of the entryman's
grant by calling it the community property as that would
be the taking of property without due process of law. If
the Federal Government grants the homestead to the entryman himself personally, it becomes his separate property,
and not the community property of himself and his wife.
The rights of a grantee from the Federal Government
present a Federal question on which the decisions of the
Federal courts are controlling, and in the administration of
the Federal land laws the community system is unknown.
Phenix Mining Co. v. Scott, 20 Washington, 48; Cunningham v. Krutz, 41 Washington, 190; Hall v. Hall, 41 Washington, 186.
Each of the three cases last cited holds the grant from
the Government to be the separate property of the entryman and grantee.
Congress alone has the power to enact laws for the
disposition of the lands belonging to the United States.
No State can abridge that right nor interfere with the
grantee's enjoyment or possession of the lands granted by
the Federal Government. Irvine v. Marshall, 20 How.
558; Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92.
The Washington enabling act (§ 4) provides that the
public lands shall remain subject to the disposition and
under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress
of the United States.
With the right to dispose of the public lands necessarily
goes the right to protect the grants made by the Federal
Govermnent.
The wife has no interest in the lands entered by her
husband whilst he is living. See §§ 2289, 2290, 2291,
United States Comp. Stat. 1901.
A homestead acquired under the laws of the United

States is the sole and separate property of the entryman.
Any other conclusion is inconsistent with the clear and
explicit provisions of the United States statutes applicable
to homestead entries. Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92;
McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382; Hall v. Hall, 41 Washington, 186.
Wilcox v. McConnell, 13 Pet. 496, 516, does not warrant
the conclusion that after title has passed from the Federal
Government the State can take one-half of the land from
the grantee and give it to his wife by simply designating it
as community property.
In this case there is no question of descent as the
entryman is still living. The fact that the entryman's
wife died cannot affect his individual and separate property, nor give the probate court any jurisdiction over the
same.
Mr. Frank T. Post, Mr. B. B. Adams, Mr. John Salisbury and Mr. W. W. Zent for appellees:
It is the settled law of the State of Washington that the
property in controversy is community property. Kromer
v. Friday, 10 Washington, 621; Ahern v. Ahern, 31 Washington, 334; Cox v. Tompkinson, 39 Washington, 70;
Hall v. Hall, 41 Washington, 186; Cunningham v. Krutz,
41 Washington, 190; Kreig v. Lewis, 56 Washington, 196;
Teynor v. Heible, 133 Pac. Rep. 1.

v. McConnel, 13 Pet. 516; McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382; Bernier
v. Bernier, 147 U. S. 242.
To reverse the decision of the court below would invite
a system of litigation more portentous than our jurisprudence has yet known and upset thousands of titles
which depend upon it. Having received this construction
for so long a time by the courts, it would seem that if the
decisions are wrong the matter should be left to the
legislature to correct,

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill to quiet title, alleging that the plaintiff,
a married man, made entry and acquired title to the land
in question under the homestead laws of the United States
by patent issued December 17, 1903; that thereafter his
wife died, and that the defendants, the children of the
marriage, claim an interest in the land. By the laws of
the State of Washington, in which the property is situated,
it became community property unless the statutes of the
United States forbid. Teynor v. Heible, 133 Pac. Rep. 1.
On that point we follow the Washington decisions. There
was a demurrer, which was sustained by the District
Court; sub nom. Buchser v. Morss, 196 Fed. Rep. 577, and
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 202 Fed. Rep. 854. 121
C. C. A. 212.
There is no doubt, of course, that until the title is completed the laws of the United States control. Wadkins v.
Producers Oil Co., 227 U. S. 368. Bernier v. Bernier, 147
U. S. 242. Hall v. Russel, 101 U. S. 503. Gibson v.
Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92. But when the title has passed then
the land 'like all other property in the State is subject
to state legislation.' Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Peters, 498,
517. Irvine v. Marshall, 20 How. 558, 564. McCune v.
Essig, 199 U. S. 382, 390. If the United States could impress a peculiar character upon land within a State after
parting-with all title to it, at least the clearest expression
would be necessary before such a result could be reached.
Wright v. Morgan, 191 U. S. 55, 58. But it has not tried
to do anything of the sort.
No one would doubt that this title was subject to the
same incidents as any other so far as events subsequent
to its acquisition were concerned. See Wright v. Morgan,
supra. It could be lost by adverse occupation for the time
prescribed by state law, arLd in a State that adopted the
cbmmon law as to dower it would be subject to dower

if the settler subsequently married. The only semblance
of difficulty is due to the coincidence in time of the acquisition of a separate right by the settler and the beginning of a community right in the wife. But this is
by no means an extreme illustration of the division of
an indivisible instant that is practiced by the law whenever it is necessary. A statute may give a man a right
of action against another for causing his death, that accrues to him at the instant that he is vivus et mortuus.
Higgins v. Central New England & Western R. R. Co.,
155 Massachusetts, 176, 179. In the present case the
acquisition under the United States law is complete and
that law has released its control before the state law
lays hold, and, upon grounds in no way connected or
interfering with the policy of Congress, brings the community regime into play. The special family relations
thus created are not like contracts with third persons
impliedly forbidden by the act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,
§ 5, 26 Stat. 1097, amending Rev. Stat., § 2290. They
are consistent with the policy of the statute which is to
enable the settler and his family to secure a home. See
§ 2291.
Decree affirmed.
STRAUS v. FOXWORTH.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
NEW MEXICO.
No. 191.

Submitted October 20, 1913.-Decided November 17, 1913.

A statement that a statutory sale was not sufficiently advertised is a
pure conclusion of law and, in the absence of allegations of fact to
sustain it, is an empty assertion that is not admitted by demurrer.
Statements that the amount of taxes for which the property was sold
was excessive must be read in connection with other statements in the
pleading admitting that the taxes were delinquent and therefore
augmented by the statutory penalties.
