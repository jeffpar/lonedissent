MARSHALL, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
INDIANA, v. DYE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.

No. 401.

Argued October 23, 1913.-Decided December 1, 1913.

Where a board of public officials is a continuing body, notwithstanding
its change of personnel, as is the case with the State Board of Elections of Indiana, the suit will be continued against the successors in
office of those who ceased to be members of the board. Murphy v.
Utter, 186 U. S. 95.
The enforcement of the provision in Article IV, § 4 of the Constitution,
that the United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union
a republican form of government, depends upon political and governmental action through the powers conferred on the Congress and
not those conferred on the courts. Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon,
223 U. S. 118.
The claim that a judgment of the state coirt enjoining state officers
from acting under a state statute declared to be unconstitutional
denies to the State a republican form of government on account of
the interference of the judicial department with the legislative and
executive departments, does not present a justiciable controversy
concerning which the decision is reviewable by this court.
The right of this court to review judgments of the state courts is circumscribed within the limits of § 709, Rev. Stat., now § 237, Judicial
Code. Waters-PierceOil Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S. 86.
Only those having a personal, as distinguished from an official, interest
('an bring to this court for review the judgment of a state court on
the ground that a Federal right has been denied. Smith v. Indiana,
191 U. S. 138.
Whether the State Board of Elections shall submit a new state constitution to the electors of a State in accordance with a state statute,
concerns the members of the board in their official capacity only,
and a judgment of the state court that they refrain from so doing
concerns their official and not their personal rights and this court
will not review such judgment.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. R

Plaintiffs in error are citizens of the United States as
well as citizens and officers of the State of Indiana. They
are here representing the citizenship of the State of
Indiana by virtue of authority conferred upon them to do
so in a conventional and regular manner. Privileges and
immunities of these citizens of the United States are
abridged by the decision of the state court. Slaughter
House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; Crandallv. Nevada, 6 Wall. 36.
It is the right of the people in a government, republican
in form, to peaceably alter or abolish it and to institute a
new government. Art. 1, § 1, Const. Indiana.
That decision prevents the performance of an act of
extraordinary legislation by those alone who can perform
it, upon the possible ground that the method followed is
not in accordance with the procedure which the court
regards as regular, although the course to be followed is a
matter for the legislative body alone. This court has not
failed at any time to protect delegated rights and to
secure the benefit of such rights to those who are entitled
thereto.
Mr. Addison C. Harris,with whom Mr. Ralph K. Kane
was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

The case originated in a complaint filed in the Circuit
Court of Marion County, Indiana, by John T. Dye, in
which he alleged that he brought the suit for himself and
other electors and tax-payers of the State of Indiana, the
object of the suit being to enjoin the defendants, Thomas
R. Marshall, Governor, Muter M. Bachelder and Charles
0. Roemler, jointly composing the State Board of Election
Commissioners, and Lew G. Ellingham, Secretary of
State, from taking the steps required by statute to certify
and transmit to the clerks of the several counties in the

Opinion of the Court.

State a new constitution proposed by the legislature of
the State and from printing and publishing a statement
to be printed upon the ballots in such manner that the
electors might indicate their choice as to such new constitution. Upon trial in the Circuit Court an injunction
was granted. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the
State of Indiana the judgment of the Circuit Court was
affirmed. 99 N. E. Rep. 1. The case was then brought
here by-writ of error.
A motion was filed in this court on September 24, 1913,
accompanied by an affidavit, stating the death of John T.
Dye, defendant in error, and the appointment of Iugh
Dougherty as his executor and his qualification as such
in compliance with the laws of the State of Indiana and
asking that he be permitted to appear and defend as such
executor, which motion is granted.
There was also submitted on October 14, 1913, a motion
to substitute Samuel M. Ralston, Governor, and Will H.
Thompson and John E. Hollett, members of the State
Board of Election Commissioners, of the State of Indiana,
as plaintiffs in error. As the judgment in this case was
against the defendants Thomas R. Marshall, Muter M.
Bachelder and Charles 0. Roemler, composing the State
Board of Election Commissioners, and their successors in
office, and as such Board is a continuing board (§ 6897,
2 Burns Annotated Indiana Statutes, 1908), notwithstanding its change of personnel, this motion is within the
principle laid down in Murphy v. Utter, 186 U. S.95, and is
granted. See also Richardson v. McChesney, 218 U. S.
487, 492, 493. Lew G. Ellingham, Secretary of State,
is one of the plaintiffs in error and the judgment sought
to be reviewed ran against him as such Secretary of State,
and he still occupies that office.
The statute (Acts of 1911, p. 205) under which it was
proposed to submit the new constitution of the State,
provided for its submissiorl at the general election in

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

November, 1912, and required the election officials and
other officers to perform like duties to those required at
general elections, with a view to the submission of such
questions. The Supreme Court sustained the contention
that the act was void under the state constitution, holding in substance that the act of 1911 was unconstitutional
for want of authority in the legislature to submit an entire
constitution to the electors of the State for adoption or
rejection, and that, if the instrument could be construed
to be a series of amendments, it could not be submitted
as such for the reason that Article 16 of the constitution
of the State requires that all amendments to the state
constitution shall, before being submitted to the electors,
receive the approval of two general assemblies, which was
not the. case here, and that Article 16 further provides
that while an amendment or amendments to the constitution which have been agreed upon by one general assembly
are awaiting the action of a succeeding general assembly
or of the electors, no additional amendment or amendments shall be proposed, and that as a matter of fact
another amendment was still awaiting the action of the
electors.
The contention mainly urged by the plaintiffs in error
of the denial of Federal rights is that the judgment below
is in contravention of Article IV, § 4, of the Constitution
of the United States, which provides that the United
States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a
republican form of government. In Pacific Telephone
Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, this court had to consider the
nature and character of that section, and held that it
depended for enforcement upon political and governmental action through powers conferred upon the Congress
of the United States. The full treatment of the subject
in that case renders further consideration of that question
unnecessary, and the contention in this behalf presents no
justiciable controversy concerning which the decision is

MARSHALL v. DYE.

Opinion of the Court.

reviewable in this court upon writ of error to the state
court.

Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Brown, 187

U. S. 308, 314. And as to all questions said to be of a
Federal character, although the judgment of the Supreme
Court was rested solely upon its interpretation of the
state constitution, the rulings are assailed because of alleged wrongs done to the plaintiffs in error in their official
capacity only.
We have had frequent occasion to declare that the right
of this court to review the judgment of the highest court
of a State is circumscribed within the limits of § 709 of the
Revised Statutes, now §2:37 of the Judicial Code. See
Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S. 86, and cases
there cited. Among the litations upon this right is the
principle which requires those who seek to bring in review
in this court the judgment of a state court to have a personal as distinguished from an official interest in the relief
sought and in the Federal right alleged to be denied by
the judgment of the state court. This principle was laid
down in Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138, in which it was
held that the auditor of a -county of the State of Indiana
could not upon writ of error to this court have the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana declaring an exemption law of that State valid and the performance of its
provisions obligatory upon him reviewed upon the ground
that the act was repugnant to the Federal Constitution.
The court, Mr. Justice Brown delivering the opinion,
said (p. 149):
"It is evident that the auditor had no personal interest
in the litigation. He had certain duties as a public officer
to perform. The performance of those duties was of no
personal benefit to him. Their non-performance was
equally so. He neither gained nor lost anything by invoking the advice of the Supreme Court as to the proper
action he should take. He was testing the constitutionality of the law purely in the interest of third persons, viz.,

the taxpayers, and in this particular the case is analogous
to that of Caffery v. Oklahoma, 177 U. S. 346. We think
the interest of an appellant in this court should be a personal and not an official interest, and that the defendant,
having sought the advice of the courts of his own State
in his official capacity, should be content to abide by their
decision."
In Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U. S.
192, it was held that, where the Supreme Court of West
Virginia had compelled a county court by mandamus to
lower its assessment so that it would be within the limit
designated by a certain statute, this court would not
entertain a writ of error to review the judgment of the
state court, although the plaintiff in error had set up that
the assessment contended for would not provide a sufficient amount to pay the expenses of the county, part of
which it was alleged had by contract attached before the
statute in question was passed. Speaking for the court,
Mr. Justice Brewer said, (p. 197):
"That the act of the State is charged to be in violation
of the National Constitution, and that the charge is not
frivolous, does not always give this court jurisdiction to
review the judgment of a state court. The party raising
the question of constitutionality and invoking our jurisdiction must be interested in and affected adversely by
the decision of the state court sustaining the act, and the
interest must be of a personal and not of an official nature.
Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114, 118; Lampasas v.
Bell, 180 U. S. 276, 283; Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138,
148."
In the present case the Supreme Court of the State has
enjoined the plaintiffs in error as officers of the State from
taking steps to submit the proposed constitution to the
electors of the State, because in its judgment the act of the
legislature of the State requiring such submission was in
violation of the state constitution. Whether this duty

VICKSBURG v. HENSON.
231 U. S

Syllabus.

shall or shall not be perfoimed concerns the plaintiffs in
error in their official capacity only. The requirement that
they refrain from taking such steps concerns their official

and not their personal rights.

Applying the rule estab-

lished by the previous decisions of this court, it follows
the judgment of the state Supreme Court is not reviewable
here, as it is not alleged to violate rights of a personal
nature, secured by the Federal Constitution or laws.
It therefore follows that this writ of error must be
Dismissed.

MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF
VICKSBURG v. HENSON, RECEIVER OF THE
VICKSBURG WATER WORKS COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 546.

Argued October 28, 1913.-Decided December 1, 1913.

A decree of the District Court to the effect that a contemplated issue
of bonds, the issuance of which the bill sought to enjoin as wholly
illegal, was illegal at that time, leaving open the question of whether
it might be legal at a subsequent time, held, under the circumstances
of this case, to be a final decree from which an appeal could be taken
to the Circuit Court of Appeak.
Although the original bill depended solely upon diverse citizenship,
independent grounds of deprivation of Federal rights which existed
prior to the filing of the bill may be brought into the case by amended
bill, and if so, the jurisdiction of the District Court does not rest
solely on diverse citizenship and the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals is not final but an appeal may be taken to this court.
Macfadden v. United States, 213 U. S. 288.
While the enforcement of the rdle of res judicata is essential to secure
the peace and repose of society, it is equally true that to enforce the
'rule upon unsubstantial grounds would work injustice.
