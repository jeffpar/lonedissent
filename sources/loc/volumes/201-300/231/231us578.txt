OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Counsel for Plaintiff in Error.

231 U. S.

PHOENIX RAILWAY COMPANY v. LANDIS,
ADMINISTRATOR OF SANDERS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ,THE TERRITORY

OF

ARIZONA.

No. 61.

Argued November 12, 1913.-Decided December 22, 1913.

This court is disposed to accept the construction of local statutes by
the territorial court, and, therefore, held that the action for death
by negligence under Rev. Stats. Arizona 1901, pars. 2764-2766, was
for the benefit of the estate and that it was not necessary to allege or

prove the existence of beneficiaries or amount of damages sustained
by them.
Where the case was tried throughout on the proper theory of the
statute, the fact that the court in its charge may have used some
terms that were technically inappropriate held not to be ground for
reversal as the jury could not have been misled thereby.
This court in reviewing on-error the judgment bf the territorial court
is limited to those questions that may be appropriately raised on
writ of error, which excludes an objection that the verdict is against
the weight of evidence or that the damages allowed are excessive.
An instruction that the jury might consider the income and earning
capacity of deceased, his business capacity, experience, health conditions, energy and perseverance during his probable expectancy
of life, will not be held to be too general in the absence of a suitable
request of the defendant for an instruction with greater particularity.
An objection to the charge in regard to the subject of damages which
was not presented to the court below comes too late when raised in
this court for the first time.
This court will not, except in a clear case, hold that the appellate court
in a Territory erred in following the established practice and construction of a local statute in regard to the record in cases on appeal.
13 Arizona, 80, 279, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the validity of a verdict and
judgment for damages for negligence causing the death of
the judgment creditor's intestate, are stated in the opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

Alexander Britton and Mr. Evans Browne were on the brief,
for plaintiff in error.
Mr. J. M. Jamison, with whom Mr. John Mason Ross
was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This action was brought by the administrator of the
estate of George W. Sanders against the Phoenix Railway
Company. to recover damages for negligence causing the
death of the intestate. Judgment in favor of the administrator was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory.
13 Arizona, 80, 108 Pac. Rep. 247; 13 Arizona,.279, 112
Pac. Rep. 844.
The first assigmnent of error is to the effect that the
court below misconstrued the statute under which the
action was brought. Rev. St. Ariz. 1901, pars. 2764-2766.
The ruling was upon the sufficiency of the complaint,
and the court followed Southern Pacific Company v.
Wilson (1906), 10 Arizona, 162, 85 Pac. Rep. 401, and De
Amado v. Friedman (1907), 11 Arizona, 56, 89 Pac. Rep.
588, which held that the action was for the benefit of the
estate and that-it-was not necessary for the plaintiff to
allege or prove the existence of beneficiaries or the amount
of damages suffered by them.
In the first case cited, the history of the legislation was
reviewed and the conclusion was rested upon the terms of
the statute of 1901 as compared with the earlier. act.
This court has frequently stated that it is disposed to
accept the construction which -the territorial court has
placed upon a local statute. Sweeney v. Lomme, 22 Wall.
208, 213; Fox v. Haarstick, :56 U. S. 674, 679; Northern
Pacific R. R. Co. v. Hambly. 154 U. S. 349, 361; Copper
Queen Mining Co. v. Arizona Board, 206 U. S. 474, 479;
Lewis v. Herrera,208 U. S. 309, 314; English v. Arizona,

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

214 U. S. 359, 361; Santa Fe County v. Coler, 215 U. S.
296, 305; Albright v. Sandoval, 216 U. S. 331, 339; Clason
v. Matko, 223 U. S. 646, 653. The applicable considerations gain in force where, as in this case, the construction
of the statute, deliberately established and followed, has
been reaffirmed upon the eve of statehood, and we are of
the opinion that the ruling of the Supreme Court of the
Territory of Arizona should not be disturbed.
The next contention is that the court below should have
reversed the judgment of the trial court because of inconsistent instructions to the jury. After charging the
jury that if they found for the plaintiff they should award
such damages as should fairly compensate the estate of
the deceased for the loss sustained by reason of his death,
not exceeding the amount fixed by the statute, the trial
court gave a further instruction that it was "not necessary
on the part of the plaintiff to show the precise money
value of' the life of the deceased or the exact amount of
damages suffered by the beneficiaries in order to sustain a
recovery for substantial damages." It is urged that the
latter instruction was inconsistent with the former and
impliedly submitted a distinct basis of recovery, that is,
the loss to beneficiaries. It appeared in evidence that the
decedent left a wife and two adult children and that his
wife, at least, had enjoyed the benefit of his support.
The Court below while conceding that the term 'beneficiaries,' in the light of its construction of the statute,
was 'technically inappropriate! was of the opinion that
the action was tried throughout upon the theory that the
damages to be awarded were such as were suffered by the
estate and that, on considering the course of the trial
and the instructions given to the jury just prior to, and
immediately following, the one in question, it could not be
said that the language complained of might have confused
or misled the jury. We concur in this view and find in
this assignment of error no ground for reversal.

PHOENIX RY. CO. v. LANDIS.
231 U. S.

Opinion of. the Court.

It is said further that the court erred in holding that the
plaintiff was entitled to recover substantial damages for the
benefit of the estate "without evidence showing or tending
to show that deceased had ever saved or would have saved
any portion of his earnings." We have not been referred
to any ruling to this effect. No such instruction was
given to the jury and the: record does not disclose any
request for an instruction which was refused by the
trial court. The argument, in substance, is that the verdict was without sufficient basis in the evidence. It cannot be said, however, that there was no evidence to go
to the jury and, as we are limited to those questions which
may be appropriately raised on writ of error, an objection
that the verdict is. against the weight of evidence or that
the damages allowed were excessive cannot be coinsidered
in this court. Act of April 7, 1874, c. 80, ยง 2, 18 Stat.
27; Wilson v. Everett, 139 U. S. 616; Aetna Life Insurance
Co. v. Ward, 140 U. S. 76, 91; Erie Railroad Co. v. Winter,
143 U. S. 60, 75; Herencia v. Guzman, 219 U. S. 44, 45.
The trial Court charged the jury that it might "take,
into consideration the income and earning capacity of the
deceased, his business capacity, experience and habits,
his health, physical condition, energy and perseverance
during what would probably have been his lifetime if he
had not received the injuries from which death ensued."
The court below granted a rehearing upon the question
whether there was error in giving this instruction because
of a failure to specify particularly what habits the jury was
authorized to consider. 13 Arizona, 279, 112 Pac. Rep.
844. It was concluded that if the appellant desired an
instruction with greater particularity upon this point it
should have made a suitable request and having failed
to do so was not entitled to complain of the omission.
This ruling is assigned as error. It is urged that the instruction as given by the trial court was wrong in itself
in that it directed the jury, in effect, to find for the plain-

tiff the amount the deceased would have earned during
the years of his life expectancy. But this is manifestly a
misconstruction of the charge. It was not erroneous to
instruct the jury, as did the court, with respect to what
might be taken into consideration in determining the
damages sustained by the estate and the court below was
right in saying that, if the plaintiff in error desired explicit
reference to particular habits, an instruction to that
effect should have been requested. Pennock v. Dialogue,
2 Pet. 1, 15; Spring Company v. Edgar, 99 U. S. 645,
659; Texas & Pacific Rwy. Co. v. Volk, 151 U. S. 73, 78.
A further objection to the charge of the trial court upon
the subject of damages, with respect to the number of
years which should be deemed to constitute the deceased's
expectation of life, concededly was not presented to the
court below and, being raised in this court for the first
time, comes too late. Clark v. Fredericks, 105 U. S. 4;
Robinson & Co. v. Belt, 187 U. S. 41, 50.
The remaining assignments of error involve a question of
appellate practice in the Supreme Court of the Territory.
That court held, with respect to the action of the trial
court in permitting answers to certain hypothetical questions addressed to physicians, that the mere general objections disclosed by the abstract of record filed under
its rules were unavailing and it declined to scrutinize the
reporter's transcript for the purpose of discovering the objections said to have been actually made. In this course,
the court but applied its rule that "abstracts of record, as
filed, will be treated by the court as containing such portions of the record as the parties deem sufficient upon
which to try the assignments of error." Rule I, sub. VI,,
8 Arizona, iv, 71 Pac. Rep. vi. It is urged that the refusal
to examine the reporter's transcript was in violation of
the act of 1907 (Laws of Arizona, 1907, c. 74, p. 122),
But the statute has not been thus construed, and we find
no ground upon which we should be justified in holding

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLA] IOMA.

No. 105.

Argued December 8, 9, 1913.-Dccided December 22, 1913.

No Federal right is denied by an appellate court of a State in dismissing
an appeal from a lower court, because its jurisdiction was not invoked in accordance with the laws of the State, and this court cannot
review such a judgment under ยง 709, Rev. Stat., now Judicial Code,
ยง 237.
It rests with each State to prescribe the jurisdiction of its appellate
courts, and the mode of invoking it, and their rules are equally applicable when Federal, as when only local, rights are involved.
Section 12 of the act of March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1048, 1081, providing
for the review of judgments of the courts temporarily established in
the Indian Territory, related only to such judgments .and has no
application to judgments rendered by the state courts after Statehood.
The method of subjecting the judgments of a subordinate state court
to review by appellate courts of the State is a matter of local concern and not within the control of Congress. Coyle v. Smith, 221
U. S.559.
