ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY v.
FUENTES ET AL., CONSTITUTING THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF LOUISIANA.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 423.

Argued January 8, 1915.-Decided February 1, 1915.

The switching of empty cars to and from a connection with an interstate railroad to a side track within the terminal of another railroad,
for the purpose of being there loaded with goods intended for interstate commerce, constitutes a part of interstate commerce, the regulation of which Congress has undertaken, and any order of a state commission regulating such switching transcends the limits of its power.
When freight actually starts in the course of transportation from one
State to another it becomes a part of interstate commerce; and it is
the essential nature of the movement and not the form of the bill
of lading that determines the character of the commerce involved.
Order 295 of the Louisiana Railroad Commission, relative to switching
of cars between connecting carriers and requiring carriers to conform
to rates established by the Commission as to cars shipped in or out
of the State, held unconstitutional as a burden upon, and an attempt
to regulate, interstate commerce.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution of orders
made by the State Railroad Commission of Louisiana
relative to switching of cars as applied to cars used in
interstate commerce, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Hunter C. Leake and Mr. Gustave Lemle were on the
brief, for appellant;

Argument for Appellant.

236 U. S.

The District Court had jurisdiction.
A switching movement, whereby interstate freight is
delivered or an interstate movement is originated, is itself
a movement in interstate commerce.
The order, since it deals with interstate commerce, is
invalid as encroaching upon the exclusive authority of
Congress.
This order cannot be construed as applying only to
intrastate commerce, and thereby saved from invalidity.
The order if affecting interstate commerce is invalid not
only on Federal grounds but because it violates the Constitution of Louisiana.
The decision of the court below was based on Grand
Trunk Ry. v. Michigan R. R. Commission, 231 U. S. 457.
The effect of the order of the Commission is to deprive
the appellant of its property without due process of law.

Mr. Wylie M. Barrow,with whom Mr. Ruffin G. Pleasant,
Attorney ,General of the State of Louisiana, was on the
brief, for appellees:
The Railroad Commission of Louisiana has power and
authority to adopt Order No. 295. The laws of the
State require railroads operating in Louisiana to perforn
the service.
The 6rder was directed against all railroads operating
inthe State.
The order does not deprive appellant of its liberty to
contract, nor of its property without due process of law,
nor does it deny it .the equal protection of the laws, in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
There is no encroachment upon the Federal exercise of
power by the order of the Commission, which prescribes a
reasonable regulation in aid of commerce and which prevents unjust discrimination in intracity switching.
The order of the Commission does not require the
railroad company to give the use of its terminals to its
connections.
The regulating power of the Commission extends over
the carrier and all of its appurtenances.
When a railroad company declines a switch for its
connections, or for shippers, between points on its terminals, on equal terms, at reasonable rates, it unjustly
discriminates.
The order of the Commission, being in aid of corn-

merce, does not conflict with the Act to Regulate Commerce.
The Commission's order prevents unjust discrimination
in the switching of cars.
Appellant has opened its terminals and switches cars
between points in the city of New Orleans for some; it
should not be allowed to deny similar service to all who
apply.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

court.
After a full hearing and investigation the Railroad Commission of Louisiana, on August 8, 1903, promulgated the
following, known as Order No. 295:
"No railroad company operating in the State of Louisiana shall refuse or decline to switch cars for any other
railroad with which it connects or any shipper, or consignee, at rates approved or established by the Commission, whether such, cars are to be loaded with freight to
be shipped out. of the State, or are loaded with freight
shipped into the State. All tariffs for the 'service' of
switching cars in the State of Louisiana, shall be filed with
the Commission, within thirty days from the date of this
order, and all the Commission's rules and orders relative
to rates and changes in rates, will also apply to switching
charges."
By a proceeding against the members of the commission,
commenced in the United States Circuit Court, Eastern
District of Louisiana, February 10, 1904, the appellant,

a common carrier of freight and passengers operating
lines in Louisiana, attacked the validity of this order
upon the ground that it is an unlawful attempt to regulate

interstate commerce and for other reasons, and prayed
that defendants be restrained from enforcing it. Shortly
thereafter a temporary injunction was granted to remain
effective pending the cause or until otherwise directed;
and on October 6, 1904, defendants answered denying
all the alleged equities. The record discloses no further
action by either party until April, 1913, when a rather
meagre and unsatisfactory agreed statement of facts was
filed. The trial court dismissed the bill without prejudice
-January, 1914,-saying that the questions involved
had been indirectly decided by this court in Grand Trunk

Ry. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, 231 U. S. 457.
voL. ccxxxVI-11

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

From this decree a direct appeal was taken and a supersedeas was allowed.
The extraordinary delay in bringing the cause to final
hearing is not explained; and in the circumstances we
deem it quite sufficient briefly to indicate and decide the
controlling question.
With the consent of the proper local authorities appellant constructed and now operates at New Orleans
extensive terminals including switch and side tracks,
warehouses and yards. These are essential to the proper
conduct of its large interstate and foreign business; and
when it brings freight there the cars are placed on its
various switch tracks to be unloaded by the consignees.
At New Orleans physical connections exist between appellant's tracks and the lines of competitive railroads
leading therefrom to many States; if Order No. 295 is
enforced its switch tracks will be subjected to use by such
railroads; more cars will pass over them; and its power to
comply with obligations to patrons will be hindered.
Together with the various railroads appellant has published and now has in effect terminal tariffs covering
switching; these include no rates for transporting freight
to or from the city" but simply cover the charges made for
switching cars from the depot or yard of one railroad
company to points on its terminals." Upon orders of the
consignees certain switch movements are made entirely
within the switching limits of the city between points one
or both of which may be located upon the terminals of the
Illinois Central, and for these charges are made varying
according to distance with an addition of three dollars
per car for rental. When a car loaded with interstate
freight arrives at New Orleans the consignee is first notified
that the contents are ready for delivery at the carrier's
depot orwarehouse. After calling and paying the charges
he gives to. the agent of the railroad transporting the
shipment an order directing that the cars be switched and

ILL. CENT. R. R. v. LOUISIANA R. R. COMM.

Opinion of the Court.

placed on some terminal or industrial track for delivery.
This order is then submitted to the Illinois Central Railroad and in due course is executed by it.
From the foregoing summary of the facts stipulated it
fairly appears that obedience to Order No. 295 would require appellant, upon demand of a carrier or shipper and
on terms fixed by the State Commission, to switch empty
cars from any connection with a competing interstate
railroad to a designated side track within its own terminals
for the purpose of being loaded there with goods intended
for interstate commerce, and when so loaded to move the
same back to the competitor's line for continued transportation to another State. Likewise appellant would be
required to accept from competing interstate lines at
points within the city loaded cars brought from other
States and place them on its own side track, although such
track was the real destination contemplated at the time
of the original shipment. Switching movements of this
kind (we do not now inquire as to others) constitute a
part of interstate commerce the regulation of which
Congress has undertaken, and consequently the order of
the State Commission transcends the limits of its powers.
When freight actually starts in the course of transportation from one State to another it becomes a part of interstate commerce. The essential nature of the movement
and not the form of the bill 6f lading determines the character of the commerce involved. And generally when
this interstate character has been acquired it continues
at least until the load reaches the point where the parties
originally intended that the movement should finally
end. McNeill v. Southern Railway, 202 U. S. 543, 559;

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

The contention for appellees that switching cars at
junctions and terminals "is only interstate commerce
when performed as a part of the interstate movement on
a through rate or bill of lading under tariff authority"
is contrary to the doctrine established by opinions of this
court in the cases cited above. We cannot undertake as
suggested to dissect the contested order and point out
whether any part of it constitutes "a workable scheme
for the regulation of intrastate traffic." Problems relating alone to commerce wholly within the State must be
left to the discretion of the State Commission to be exercised upon a view of all existing, relevant facts and
circumstances.
The present controversy is not controlled by Grand
Trunk Ry. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, supra.
The issues in the two cases are essentially different. There
the attack was upon an order of the State Commission
"suspensory only of the tariff of the appellants, not a
final determination against it or of the conditions which
might or might not justify it," and the question was
"whether, under the statutes of the State of Michigan,
appellants can be compelled to use the tracks it owns
and operates in the city of Detroit for the interchange of
intrastate traffic."
The movement actually regulated
was held to be intrastate commerce. It took place within
Detroit but between points sufficiently far apart to constitute genuine transportation; and, treating it as a local
matter, the Railway Company had applied special tariffs
thereto until withdrawn because of disagreement with
shippers and commission.
The original bill should have been sustained and a
permanent injunction awarded. The decree below is
accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed.
