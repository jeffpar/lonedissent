APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 151, 152, 154, 155, 156. Argued January 26, 27, 1915.-Decided
February 23, 1915.
Although several cases cancelling patents for fraud have been decided by the District Court without opinion, if the same decree was
entered in all the cases and all were alike in their main features,
although varying in details, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed all the decrees with an opinion stating that fraud in the entry
was proved and that the grantee was charged with knowledge, the
two courts' must be deemed to have concurred in their findings;
and the rule that under such conditions their determinations upon
questions of fact, in absence of clear error will not be disturbed,
applies.
While a patent obtained by fraud is not void or subject to collateral
attack, it may be directly assailed'by the Government in a suit
against the patentee or grantee, and such a suit can only be sustained by proof producing conviction.
Despite satisfactory proof of fraud in obtaining the patent, if the legal
title has passed, bona fide purchase for value is a perfect defense;
but it is an affirmative one Which the grantee must establish in
order to defeat the Government's right to cancel a patent which
fraud alone is shown to have induced. Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet.

203 Fed. Rep. 263, affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Appellant.

236 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the validity of certain land
patents issued under the homestead laws of the United
States, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. J. Blanc Monroe, with whom Mr. Monte M. Lemann
and Mr. A. R. Mitchell were on the brief, for appellant:
When the United States brings a suit to annul a patent
to land held by a vendee of the entryman, on the ground
of fraud in the entryman it must prove actual notice of
such fraud in said vendee. United States v. Clark, 200
U. S. 601; United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U. S.
321.
When the United States seeks to annul a .patent on
grounds of fraud in the entryman and notice in his vendee,
the specific details of the fraud and of the notice must be
set out in the bill, and the probata must conform to the
allegata. Maxwell Land Grant Case, 121 U. S. 325; United
States v. Barber Lumber Co., 172 Fed. Rep. 950; United
States v. Atherton, 102 U. S. 372; Harrisonv. Nixon, 9 Pet.
503.
It will not do for the United States to allege notice in
one way and: through named individuals and to attempt
to prove notice in another way and through other individuals. See cases supra.
When seeking to annul a patent under the seal and signature of the President, the United States to succeed must
adduce that class of evidence which commands respect
and that amount which produces conviction. A patent
cannot be set aside upon a bare preponderance of evidence
which leaves the issue in doubt. Maxwell Land GrantCase,
121 U. S. 381; Colorado Coal Co. v. United States, 123 U. S.
307; 133 U. S. 193; United States v. Stinson, 197 U. S. 200.
The officials of the land office of the United States are
affirmatively charged with the duty of investigating land
entries and of ascertaining before issuing either a final receipt or patent, that the law is fully complied with. The

WRIGHT-BLODGETT CO. v. UNITED STATES.
236 U. S.

399

Argument for Appellant.

purchaser from a person holding a final receipt is charged
with no such duty. On the contrary, he is entitled to buy
on the faith of the patent and receipt and without looking
for grounds of doubt. If the bill shows that the entryman's actions, settlement and proof deceived the trained
sleuths of the Government land department, and that
they issued both final receipt and patent, a strong de facto
presumption arises that the entryman's vendee was likewise deceived.
General statements that representatives of the defendant were in the general neighborhood at the time of the
purchase are not sufficient to overcome this presumption
particularly so when the improvements placed upon the
land were such as to create in the casual observer the belief
that the law was fully complied with. Maxwell Land Grant
Case, 121 U. S. 381; Clark Case, 200 U. S. 601.
Nor will such general statements prevail when the
record shows that defendants were in the habit of buying
land on a general cruiser's estimate without special examination and that they purchased the particular land in
controversy on the advice of counsel of high standing after
examination of the abstract of title thereto.
As Rev. Stat., § 2301 does not require a commuter
to prove that he has not agreed to sell his land before receiving his final receipt, this court will not write such a
provision into that statute. Williamson v. United States,
207 U. S. 455; United States v. Biggs, 211 U. S. 507; Adams
v. Church, 193 U. S. 510; United States v. Sullenberger, 211
U. S. 525; United States v. Freeman, 211 U. S. 523.
When the United States, while attempting to discharge
its obligation to show actual notice on the part of the
defendant of the fraud in the entryman places the entryman on the stand and the latter swears that he took an
agent of the defendant to the land, pointed out to him the
improvements which he, the entryman, had placed upon
it and "assured" said agent that everything which the

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

law required had been done, the United States not only
fails to prove notice in the defendant but affirmatively establishes defendant's, good faith and absence of notice.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, with whom Mr.
S. W. Williams was on the brief, for the United States:
The two lower courts having concurred in finding that
the testimony respecting cultivation, residence, and improvements was false, and that the appellant had notice
through its agents on the ground at the time of its purchase, the finding should not be disturbed unless clearly
erroneous.
There is evidence to support the findings.
The Government having, with the requisite certainty,
established that the entries were fraudulent, the onus was
upon the appellant to make good its plea of bona fide purchase without notice.
The evidence of the unlawful prior agreements was
competent.
In support of these contentions, see Bailey v. Sanders,
228 U. S. 603; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177; Gilson v. United
States, 234 U: S. 380; Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1; Neale v.
Neales, 9 Wall. 1; Texas & Pac. Ry. v. R. R. Com. of
La., 232 U. S. 338; United States v. Brannan, 217 Fed.
Rep. 849; United States v. Cal. & Oreg. Land Co., 192 U. S.
355; United States v. Clark, 200 U. S. 601; United States v.
Hill, 217 Fed. Rep. 841.
MV. JUSTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
These five cases, although involving, separate transactions, may conveniently be considered in a single opinion.
The suits were brought by the United States to annul certain land patents I issued under the homestead laws upon
'In No. 151 the entry was made October 19, 1898, by Joe J. Hicks;

the ground that the respective entrymen had defrauded
the Government in securing the patents in that they had
not actually resided upon the land and cultivated it as
required by the statute, the statements in their proofs
upon commutation being false. Rev. Stat., § 2301. It
was further averred that the Wright-Blodgett Company,
the appellant, at the time of its purchase of the respective
tracts had notice through its agents of the fraud which
had been perpetrated by the entrymen. The appellant
answered in each case, disclaiming all knowledge of the
alleged fraud and setting up that it was a bona fide purchaser for value after the issuance to the entrymen of the
final receipts. The caes were separately heard and in
each, upon pleadings and proofs, a decree was entered
canceling the patent. Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the decrees. The opinion of that court
stated that it found 'that fraud in the homestead entry'
was proved, and that the appellant was 'charged through
its active agents on the ground with knowledge of the
fraud.'

commutation proof was offered June 11, 1901, and final certificate issued July 8, 1901; on-July 10, 1901, the entryman sold the land to the

Bryers; commutation proof was offered August 17, 1901, and final
certificate issued September 18, 1901; on September 28, 1901, the entryman sold the land to the appellant. Patent was issued April 1, 1902.
VOL. ccxxxvi-26

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

The appellant urges that it does not appear that the
two courts concurred in their findings as the cases were
decided in the District Court without opinion and, in
three of the cases, there was testimony which, according
to the Government, tended to show that the transactions
were fraudulent not only because there had not been the
residence and cultivation required by the statute and
stated in the proofs, but also because of agreements prior
to the commutation priofs to sell the lands to the appellant. But the District Court rendered its decree ip the
five cases on the same day; in two of these, it is not suggested that there was evidence of such anticipatory agreements, but the same decree was entered and must have
proceeded on the evidence as to the lack of residence and
cultivation. While the facts in the several cases vary in
details they ate so far alike in their main features with
respect to residence and cultivation as to make it absolutely impossible to assume that any different conclusion
of fact was reached by the District Court in the three cases
than that at which it arrived in the two others. The two
courts must be deemed to have concurred in their findings
and in accordance with the well-settled rule their determination upon mere questions of fact will not be disturbed, unless clear error is shown. Stuart v. Hayden, 169
U. S. 1, 14; Towson v. Moore, 173 U. S. 17, 24; Texas &
Pacific Ry. v. Railroad Commission, 232 U. S. 338, 339;
Washington Securities Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 76,
78;-Gilson v. United States, 234 U. S. 380, 384. An examination of the record fails to disclose any such error in the
finding as to the fraud of the entrymen, and it is not neeeessary to recite the evidence.
It is insisted, however, that in the finding as to the
standing of the appellant there was involved an erroneous
application of the law. In substance, the argument comes
to this,-that in a suit by the United States to cancel a
patent upon the ground of fraud, where the land is held

WRIGHT-BLODGETT CO. v. UNITED STATES.
236 U. S.

403

Opinion of the Court.

by a grantee of the entryman, the Government must
establish that the grantee is not a bona fide purchaser
for value; that this must'be shown by proof of a clear and
cogent character; and that, measured by this standard,
the Government's case was not made out. This contention
proceeds upon an erroneous view of the governing principles as repeatedly set forth in the decisions of this court.
These principles may be briefly restated: Where a patent
is obtained by false and fraudulent proofs submitted for
the purpose of deceiving the officers of the Government,
and of thus obtaining public lands without compliance
with the requirements of the law, while the patent is not
void or subject to collateral attack, it may be directly assailed in a suit by the Government against the parties
claiming under it. In such case, the respect due to a
patent, the presumption that all the preceding steps required by the law had been observed before its issue, and
the immense importance of stability of titles dependent
upon these instruments, demand that suit to cancel them
should be sustained only by proof which produces conviction. United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 239; Maxwell
Land-Grant Case, 121 U. S. 325, 381; United States v.
Stinson, 197 U. S. 200, 204, 205; Diamond Coal Co. v.
United States, 233 U. S. 236, 239. And, despite satisfactory proof of fraud in obtaining the patent, as the legal
title has passed, bona fide purchase for value is a perfect
defense. ColoradoCoal Co. v. United States, 123 U. S. 307,
313; United States v. Stinson, supra; Diamond Coal Co. v.
United States, supra; United'States v. Detroit Lumber Co.,
200 U. S. 321; United States v. Clark, 200 U. S. 601. But
this is an affirmative defense which the grantee must establish in order to defeat the Government's right to the
cancellation of the conveyance which fraud alone is shown
to have induced. The rule as to this defense is thus stated
in Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177, 211, 212: "In setting it up
by plea or answer, it must state the deed of purchase, the

date, parties, and contents briefly; that the vendor was
seized in fee, and in possession; the consideration must be
stated, with a distinct averment that it was bona fide and
truly paid, independently of the recital in the deed.
Notice must be denied previous to, and down to the time
of paying the money, and the delivery of the deed; and if
notice is specially charged, the denial must be of all circumstances referred to, from which notice can be inferred;
and the answer or plea show how the grantor acquired
title.

.

.

.

The title purchased must be apparently

perfect, good at law, a vested estate in fee-simple ...
It must be by a regular conveyance; for the purchaser of
an equitable title holds it subject to the. equities upon it
in the hands of the vendor, and has no better standing in
a court of equity.

.

.

.

Such is the case which must

be stated to give a defendant the benefit of an answer or
plea of an innocent purchase without notice; the case
stated must be made out, evidence will not be permitted
to be given of any other matter not set out." See also

207; Prickett v. Muck, 74 Wisconsin, 199; Bank v. Ellis, 30
Minnesota, 270; Lewis v. Lindley, 19 Montana, 422. In
United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., supra, the Circuit
Court of Appeals found that the Detroit Company was
a purchaser in good faith and this court reviewing the
facts reached the same result. The Company had no
knowledge or intimation of wrong until long after the issuance of the patents. In United States v. Clark, supra,
both courts below had found that Clark had no actual
knowledge of the alleged frauds or of facts sufficient to put

him upon inquiry. Clark, his agents and advisers, testified that they did not know or suspect anything wrong.
(200 U. S., p. 608.) The defense of bona fide purchaser for
value was completely made out and what is said in the
opinion must be read in the light of that fact. Nothing
was shown to impair the case which the defendant had
established; and there was no intention to depart from
the well-settled rule to which we have 'referred.
In the present case the appellant had its agents upon
the ground and it has been found that through these
agents it had knowledge of the fraud. rThe contention
that as the Government had alleged notice through particular agents it could not be shown that the Company
had acquired knowledge through other agents than those
named is without merit; the allegation in the bill as to the
particular agents was surplusage. Upon the question of
fact, with respect to bona fides in its purchase, both courts
below have found against the appellant and the record does
not show any error requiring the reversal of the decrees.
