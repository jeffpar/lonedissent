EVENS AND HOWARD FIRE BRICK COMPANY v.
UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 567.

Argued October 2.), 1914.-Decided February 23, 1915.

The court below, in settling the decree on the mandate of this court has
no power to allow persons who were not parties to the action to intervene. This court, however, can take action on an original petition
for intervention in this court. (See pp. 194, 199, ante.)
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George M. Block, with whom Mr. John F. Lee was
on the brief, for appellants.

OLYMPIA MINING CO. v. KERNS.
236 U. S.

Syllabus.

Mr. Edward C. Crow, with whom The Solicitor General
was on the brief, for the United States.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This appeal was taken from the order of the court refusing to allow an intervention on the ground that there
was no jurisdiction to do so because as the result of a
previous final decree and an appeal taken therefrom by
the United States, the authority of the court over the
subject-matter was ended. In effect the relief which was
sought to be accomplished by the intervention below has
been obtained as the result of an original petition for intervention here and our action this day taken thereon.
As those applying to intervene were not parties to the
record, we are of opinion that the court below had no power
to allow them to intervene under the circumstances
which existed and its judgment refusing their application
was therefore right and is
Affirmed.
