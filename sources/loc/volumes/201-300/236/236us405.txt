(200 U. S., p. 608.) The defense of bona fide purchaser for
value was completely made out and what is said in the
opinion must be read in the light of that fact. Nothing
was shown to impair the case which the defendant had
established; and there was no intention to depart from
the well-settled rule to which we have 'referred.
In the present case the appellant had its agents upon
the ground and it has been found that through these
agents it had knowledge of the fraud. rThe contention
that as the Government had alleged notice through particular agents it could not be shown that the Company
had acquired knowledge through other agents than those
named is without merit; the allegation in the bill as to the
particular agents was surplusage. Upon the question of
fact, with respect to bona fides in its purchase, both courts
below have found against the appellant and the record does
not show any error requiring the reversal of the decrees.

UNITED STATES v. SMULL.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF OREGON.
No. 598.. Argued January 7, 1915.-Decided February 23, 1915.
A charge of crime against the United States must have clear legislative basis.
A charge of perjury may be based on § 125, Criminal Code, for knowingly swearing falsely to an affidavit required either expressly by Act
of Congress or by an authorized regulation of the Land Department.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for the United States.

236 U. S.

When by valid regulation the Land Department requires an affidavit
to be made before an otherwise competent officer, that officer is
authorized to administer the oath under § 125, Criminal Code, and
the false swearing is made a crime and the penalty is fixed therefor
by Congress and not by the Department.
In regard to affidavits required by the Land Department, § 125,
Criminal Code, must be read in the light of § 2246, Rev. Stat., authorizing and making it the duty of the specified officer of the Land
Department to administer oaths.
The departmental rule requiring an applicant for homestead entry
under § 2289, Rev. Stat., to state under oath whether or not he has
made a former entry under the homestead law is one addressed to
the enforcement of the laws, the administration whereof is confided
to the Land Department, and is not inconsistent with any specific
statutory provision and the oath required is therefore one administered by authority of law as provided in § 125, Criminal Code.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of Rev. Stat., § 2289, and the validity of an indictment for perjury for violation thereof, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, with whom
Mr. S. W. Williams was on the brief, for the United States:
The case was one in which the laws of the United States
authorized the oath, and the false matter was material
within the meaning of § 125 of the Criminal Code.
The homestead law expressly forbids the making of second entries, such as was attempted in this case, and charges
the Land Department with the duty of preventing them.
In the performance of this duty it is not merely convenient but essential that the Department examine the
applicant concerning the existence of a former entry, and
therefore the duty to make the examination is a duty
springing directly from the homestead law itself and covered by its specific requirement (Rev. Stat., § 2478) that
every part of it shall be enforced by appropriate regulations.
The duty to examine the applicant includes the duty,
and hence the power, to examine him on oath.

UNITED STATES v. SMULL.
236 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

That such oaths were intended to be included by § 125,
Crim. Code (Rev. Stat., § 5392) is demonstrated by its
broad terms and its evident purpose, illuminated by the
statutes from which it was derived.
The language is, "in any case 'in which a law of the
United States authorizes an oath to be administered."
The evident purpose is as broad as the letter.
An inquiry into the antecedents of this section will
leave no doubt of its applicability to cases like the present.
The circumstance that certain matters to be covered by
the claimant's initial affidavit are specified in § 2290 implies no prohibition against his examination under oath
upon other matters which are vital to the right of entry.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an indictment for perjury. It is charged that
Luther Jerome Smull, the defendant in error, in making
application for a homestead entry under § 2289 of the
Revised Statutes swore falsely, before the receiver of
the land office, that he had not theretofore 'made any
entry under the homestead laws,' whereas in fact, as he
well knew, he had previously made a homestead entry
upon which he had obtained patent. The defendant
demurred upon the ground that the indictment did not
state a crime. The District Court sustained the demurrer,
ruling that the affidavit was not within the statute defining perjury. Criminal Code, § 125. The Government
brings the case here under the Criminal Appeals Act.
The charge of crime must have clear legislative basis.
Williamson, v. United States, 207 U. S. 425; United States
v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506; United States v. George, 228
U. S. 14; United States v. Birdsall, 233 U. S. 223. The
Criminal Code, § 125, provides: "Whoever, having taken
an oath before a competent tribunal, officer,, or person, in
any case in which a law of the United States authorizes
an oath to be administered, . . . shall wilfully' and
contrary to such oath state or subscribe any material
matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of
perjury.
" This statute takes the place .of the
similar provision of § 5392 of the Revised Statutes, which
in turn was a substitute for a number of statutes in regard
to perjury and was phrased so as to- embrace all cases
of false swearing whether in a court of justice or before
administrative officers acting within their powers (see
revisers' report, Vol. 2, pp. 2582, 2583). 1 It cannot be
I Among these statutes was the Act of March 3, 1857, c. 116, §5 (11

made or taken before any register or receiver or either or both of them

Opinion of the Court.

doubted that a charge of perjury may be based upon
§ 125 of the Criminal Code where the affidavit is required
either expressly by an act of Congress or by an authorized
regulation of the General Land Office, and is known by
the affiant to be false in a material statement. That is,
the Land Department has authority to make regulations
which are not inconsistent with law and are appropriate
to the performance of its duties (Revised Statutes, §§ 161,
441, 453, 2478), and when by a valid regulation the Department requires that an affidavit shall be made before
an officer otherwise competent, that officer is authorized
to administer the oath within the meaning of § 125. The
false swearing is made a crime, not by the Department,
but by Congress; the statute, not the Department, fixes
the penalty. -United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S., p. 522.
Section 125 of the Criminal Code must be read in the
light of § 2246 of the Revised Statutes which is explicit:
"The register or receiver is authorized, and it shall
of any local land-office in the United States or any territory thereof, or
where any oath, affirmation, or affidavit, shall be made or taken before
any person authorized by the laws of any State or territory of the United
States to administer oaths or affirmations, or take affidavits, and such
oaths, affirmations, or affidavits are made, used, or filed in any of said
local land-offices, or in the General Land-Office, as well in cases arising
under any or either of the orders, regulations, or instructions, concerning any of the public lands of the United States, issued by the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, or other proper officer of the
government of the United States, as under the laws of the United States,
in any wise relating to or affecting any right, claim, or title, or any contest therefor, to any of the public lands of the United States, and any
person or persons shall, taking such oath, affirmation or affidavit,
knowingly, wilfully, or corruptly 9wear or affirm falsely, the same shall
be deemed and taken to be perjury, and the person or persons guilty
thereof shall, upon conviction, be liable to the punishment prescribed
for that offence by the laws of the United States."

be their duty, to administer any oath required by law
or the instructions of the General Land-Office, in connection with the entry or purchase of any tract of the public
lands."
As it is apparent that the departmental rule makes it
necessary for the applicant to state under oath whether
or not he has made a former entry under the homestead
laws, the sole question in the present case is whether this
requirement was one which the Department could impose.
This inquiry is naturally divided into two branches:
(1) Was the regulation addressed to the enforcement of
the laws, the administration of which was confided, to
the Department, and (2) Was it inconsistent with any
specific provision of the statutes?
As to the former, it is sufficient to say that the homestead laws contain an express prohibition with respect
to the amount of land which any one person may secure
under their provisions, and the Commissioner of the
General Land Office is entrusted with the duty of promulgating appropriate rules to make this prohibition
effective. Thus, by the act of May 20, 1862, c. 75, § 6
(12 Stat. 392, 393), it was provided: 'That no individual
shall be permitted to acquire title to more than one quarter section under the provisions of this act; and that the
Commissioner of the General Land Office is hereby required to prepare and issue such rules and regulations,
consistent with this act, as shall be necessary and proper
to carry its provisions into effect.' The prohibition was
carried forward into the Revised Statutes (§§ 2289, 2298;
act of Mar. 3, 1891, c. 561, § 5, 26 Stat. 1095, 1098) and
the authority of the Department to enforce it was continued and not diminished (§ 2478). It would seem to
be plain that a rule requiring an affidavit from the applicant stating whether or not he had made other entries
was suitably addressed to the execution of the law. United
States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 238; Caha v. United States, 152

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 211; United States v. Grimaud, supra; United States
v. Birdsall, supra, Leonard v. Lennox, 181 Fed. Rep.
760, 766, 767.
There remains the question whether the regulation is
in onsistent with the terms of the statute; that is, as there
is no suggestion of inconsistency otherwise, whether it
is repugnant to the specific requirements of § 2290 of
the Revised Statutes as amended by the act of March 3,
1891, c. 561, supra, in relation to the affidavit to be mad
by the applicant for a homestead entry. We do not think
that it is. Section 2290, it is true, does not provide that
the affidavit of the applicant shall set forth whether there
has been a previous entry. Neither does it provide that
the applicant shall state that he is a citizen or has filed his
declaration of intention to become such. Yet, under
§ 2289, he cannot make entry unless this qualification
exists. We are concerned with positive requirements of
the law, which are to be enforced by the Department.
They are not superadded by an unauthorized departmental caution. And this being true, the fact that § 2290
is specific as to certain matters which the applicant's
affidavit must contain cannot be regarded as destroying
the authority of the Department to exact proof as to other
facts which are also essential conditions of the right of
entry and as to the existence of which the Department
must be satisfied.
It is not a case where the statute points out the character
of the proof to be required as to the particular fact and
thus impliedly denies authority to exait proof of a different
sort. Thus, with respect to final proof of residence and
cultivation, § 2291 of the Revised Statutes requires the
proof to be made by 'two credible witnesses '-not by
the claimant; accordingly it was held that Congress had
provided the 'exact measure' of thb claimant's obligation
and that the Department could neither add to nor detract from it. United States v.:George, 228 U. S. 14. But

here the statute is silent as to the mode of proving the
particular fact. Still it is an essential fact; Congress
made it the duty of the Department to enforce the condition prescribed, and in the absence either of inhibition
or of a requirement of some other "procedure we are unable to find any ground for saying that Congress debarred
the Department from availing itself of the natural and
appropriate course in examining the applicant. It has
been the long established departmental practice to insist
upon a verified statement by him whether or not he has
made an earlier entry, and we are of the opinion that
the practice is authorized. The oath in such cases is
administered by authority of law as provided in § 125
of the Criminal Code.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed and
the case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
