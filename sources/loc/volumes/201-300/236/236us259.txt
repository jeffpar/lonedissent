UNITED STATES v. ERIE RAILROAD.
236 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

UNITED STATES v. ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR TRIE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF NEW YORK.

Nos. 493, 494. Argued January 11, 12, 1915.-Decided February 23, 1915.
A ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission which ws never enforced-the custom of the carriers being uniformly the other waycannot have the weight ordinarily accorded to the contemporaneous
construction of a statute by the officers upon whom is imposed the
duty of administering it.
While the Act to Regulate Commerce controls the relations of carriers
subject to the act with each other, such carriers may have relations
with other carriers who are not subject to the act, and permission to
exchange passes with other carriers subject to the act can reasonably
extend to other carriers who are not subject thereto, the same business reasons existing in both cases.
A comparison of possibilities under different constructions of a statute,
which is but a comparison of excesses that are possible but not likely
to be practiced, is not a fair argument.
The practice of carriers exchanging passes with other carriers has its
justification in a strictly business policy, and, instead of being a
burden upon their resources, is an aid.
The permission in the proviso of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce,
as amended by the act of June 29, 1906, for the interchange of passes
by common carriers, includes the interchange of passes with carriers
not subject to the provisions of the act as well as those who are subject thereto.
THE facts, which involve the provisions of the Act to
Regulate Commerce regulating the giving and exchange
of passes by carriers, are stated in the opinion.

Thurlow M. Gordon was on the brief, for the United States:
The construction of the disputed exception in the AntiPass Provisions of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce

for which the government contends is the construction
which has been adopted by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the administrative body charged with the
enforcement of that act.
With the Commission's construction of the disputed
exception before it, Congress, in rebnacting in 1910 the
Anti-Pass Provision, made no change whatever in the
language of the exception. Annual Report, I. C. C. 1907;
Conference Rulings, I. C. C. Nos. 95-g, 196, 216; In re
Free Transportation,12 I. C. C. 39; United States v. Falk,
204 U. S. 143; United States v. Hermanos, 209 U. S. 337;
Valk v. United States, 28 Ct. Cls. 241.

The construction of a statute by the administrative
body charged with its enforcement is always entitled to
great weight, and when, as here, Congress has reenacted
the statute without altering the part construed, the administrative construction, unless plainly erroneous, must
be taken as impliedly ratified by Congress, and therefore
as binding upon the courts. B. & M. R, Co. v. Hooke.,

It is also a violation of § 3 of the Elkins Act.
The proviso in § 1 permitting the issuance of passes to
the employ~s of common barriers includes only enploy~s
of common carriers subject to the act.
The first paragraph of § 1 of the act limits the provision
with respect to railroad common carriers to those engaged
in interstate transportation.
The proviso did not bring a new class of common carriers under discussion, but simply carved out certain exceptions. In re Webb, 24 How. Pr. 247, 249.
It was not the intention of Congress to divide common
carriers into two classes, one subject to the act and one not
subject to the act. 40 Cong. Record, p. 7922. The use
of the word "interchange" in the proviso indicates so;
otherwise the supervisory power of the Commission over
issuance of passes would be destroyed to this extent.
There can no more be free railroad transportation than
there can be free taxes. The greater the number who
escape payment of transportation taxes the greater the
burden on those who do pay.
One of the main purposes of the Act to Regulate Commerce was to put an end to passes and discrimination
which had grown up in the practice of interstate carriers:
see Louis. & Nash. R. R. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 468.
The Interstate Commerce Commission has uniformly
so held. In re Exchange of Free Transportation,12 I. C. C.

Eureka Springs Ry., 7 I. C. C. 286, 311; Wylie v. Nor. Pac.

These holdings of the Commission agree with the pur-

poses of Congress expressed in the act and best serve the
remedial features of the legislation, and unless there is
some controlling reason to the contrary, the courts will not
discredit or disparage the conclusions of the Commission.
This contemporaneous construction by those having
in charge the enforcement of the act should have great
weight. New Haven Case, 200 U. S. 361, 401; United
States v. Hermanos, 209 U. S. 337, 339; United States v.
Philbrick, 120 U. S. 52, 59; Tifft v. Southern Ry.,,158 Fed.

Fed. Rep. 931; Ill. Cent. R. R. v. I. C. C., 206 U. S. 441;
United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760.
The free-pass provision should be construed in harmony
with the purpose of its enactment. N. Y., N. H. & H. Ry.
v. Int. Com. Comm., 200 U. S. 361; Lau Ow v. United
States, 114 U. S. 47; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S.
578; United States v. Traffic Ass'n, 171 U. S. 550.
Section 1 of the act specifically provides to what common carriers the act shall apply. The carriers in controversy-that is, the ocean steamship line and the English railroad-do not come within the terms of the act.
This is emphasized by the amendment inserted in the
anti-pass proviso in 1910.
The provisions in § 22 allowing passes to be given to the
employ~s of other railroads are modified by § 1, asamended in 1906. The original provision in §.22 was
enacted in 1887.
Even if the provisions in § 22 were not repealed, the
expression contained therein that passes may be issued to
employds of other railroads includes only employ~s of
the railroad companies subject to the act.
The Erie Railroad is a carrier subject to the act and
bound by it, and the court may issue an injunction broad
enough to cover any future issuance of interstate passes
to the agents or employ~s of carriers not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission, under the act.

Counsel for Appellee.

236 U. S.

The contention of the defendant would practically
nullify the anti-pass section through enlarging by many
.millions the number of those entitled to receive these
bounties at the expense of the'public.
In the absence of legislative authority railways should
have no more right to carry anyone free than a tax collector to remit taxes. Such privileges should be strictly construed and not enlarged by construction. The railroad
pass has been one of the most corrupting influences in
American public life. Anawakening of public conscience
brought about the amendment of 1906 to correct it.
If the defendant's contention is sustained it would
practically nullify the salutary provisions of § 1 and fan
into flame a wrong that has been smothered to a degree
compared to what it was before the amendment of 1906.
Any change should be in the direction of further restriction rather than enlargement of this privilege.
Abuses would surely follow the overruling of the Commission's interpretation of § 1.
"Mutual back scratching" with railroad passes, unless
authorized by law, is no more.lawful than "mutual back
scratching" with any other character of public taxes.

§ 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended in 1906
is unambiguous, and clearly authorizes the continuance of

act, of interchanging passes between common carriers
subject to the act and other common carriers for their respective officers and employ6s. Alexander v. Worthington,

Opinion of the Court.

The history of the long-continued and well-recognized
custom and practice of railroad companies to issue passes,
in interchange with common carriers by rail and by water
other than common carriers subject to the act as shown
by the established facts in these cases, sustains the construction of the statute contended for by appellee and
adopted by the court below. Chamberlain v. Chamberlain, 43 N. Y. 424; C., N. 0. & T. P. R. R..v. Int. Com.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
These are direct appeals from decrees dismissing two
bills filed by the United States to enjoin the railroad
company from issuing passes to employ~s of common
carriers ncd subject to the Act to Regulate C mmerce.
The action of the railroad company is alleged to be
in violation of §§ 2 and 3 of that act, Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104,
24 Stat. 379, and of §§ 1 and 6 as amended June 29, 1906,
c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 586, prohibiting rebates and preferences.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

The bills were filed in purguance of § 3 of the Act to
Further Regulate Commerce, Feb. 19, 1903, c. 708, 32
Stat. 847, 848, which authorizes proceedings in equity
to prevent common carriers from departing from -their
published rates or from committing any discrimination
forbidden by law, and the basic contention of the United
States is that the giving of passes for free transportation
constituted a departure from the carrier's published rates
and a discrimination against other passengers. To this
the railroad replies that the passes issued by it and which
constitute the ground of suit were authorized by the socalled anti-pass provision of § 1 of the Act to Regulate
Commerce. The question, therefore, is very direct and
is, What does the act authorize or prohibit?
The charge in No. 493 is that the railroad company
which is a common carrier subject to the act, in pursuance
of a standing practice, issues passes to certain of the
officers, agents and employ6s of various trans-Atlantic
steamship lines, such lines not being carriers subject to
the act, while other passengers who are transported between the samne points are required to pay the published
fares, and that the railroad company will continue the
practice.
The railroad company admits the charges and avers
that it solicits transportation over its lines of freight
brought to this country by the steamship lines; that the
latter in turn solicit from shippers on the line of the railroad company the transportation of their freight abroad;
that large amounts of traffic moving by the steamship
lines are transported by the railroad company after arrival
in or before departing from the United States, as the case
may be, some of it under through bills of lading; that the
interchange of passes between the officers and employds of
the railroad and such steamship lines to the limited extent alleged is one which as a matter of common knowledge
has existed and been openly followed by the railroad

company and other carriers generally for years; that its
existence was commonly known long before the passage
of the Interstate Commerce Act, by the terms of which
its continuance is permitted; that it rests upon the same
consideration, including Considerations of business policy
which have always been recognized as justifying the interchange of passes and is recognized and permitted by the
proviso in § 1 of the act as amended and approved June 29,
1906. The provision is as follows:
"No common carrier subject to the provisions of this
act, shall, after January 1, 1907, directly or indirectly,
issue or give any interstate free ticket, free pass, or free
transportation for passengers, .
provided, that
this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the interchange of passes for the officers, agents, and employ~s
of common carriers, and their families; nor to prohibit
any common carrier from carrying passengers free with
the object of providing relief in cases of general epidemic,
pestilence, or other calamitous visitation."
The material facts in No. 494 are the same as in
No. 493, with the exception that the passes there in controversy were issued by the railroad company to an employ6
of the Great Eastern Railway of England, and a defense
of the passes is made not only under the proviso of § 1,
above quoted, but under § 22 of the act as originally enacted, which reads as follows:
"Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent
railroads from giving free carriage to their own officers
and employ6s, or to prevent the principal officers of any
railroad company or companies from exchanging passes
or tickets with other railroad companies for their officers
and employ6s."
In support of its contention the United States adduces
certain rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and argues that Congress, having re6nacted the statute,
adopted the Commission's construction as the proper

236 U. S.

one. Counsel invoke a line of cases which decide, it is
contended, that a contemporaneous construction of a
statute by the officers upon whom is imposed the duty
of administering it is entitled to weight, and, unless clearly
wrong, to determining weight. The cases are familiar,
the doctrine they announce a useful one, and we are
brought to the inquiry, Does it apply in the case at bar?
The first of the rulings referred to was made upon
petition of Frank Parmelee & Company. That company,
which is a transfer company transferring passengers and
packages from the railroads to the hotels in Chicago,
and the reverse, asked for a ruling as to whether under
the exception contained in the proviso of § 1 it had a
right to interchange passes with the railroads. The Commission decided that the Parmelee Company was not a
carrier subject to the act and that, therefore, an interchange of passes between it and the railroads was not permissible. In subsequent Conference Rulings the Commission decided that the right to issue passes coexisted
with the obligation to file tariffs, and when the latter
did not exist the former could not be exercised. These
rulings received emphasis from the fact that "ocean
carriers to non-adjacent foreign countries" were said to
be among the carriers not subject to the act and, under
the principle announced, not entitled to receive passes.
But these rulings were never enforced and the custom
of carriers was uniformly the other way. Against a mere
verbal construction, therefore, permitted to languish-in
inactivity, we have the unopposed practice of the companies. The Commission's action, therefore, cannot have
the absolute effect tlat the Attorney General ascribes
to it; but keeping it in mind, let us proceed to a consideration of the statute.
It is not denied that the words "carriers," "common
carriers," "railroads" and "railroad companies" are used
in the act with and without qualification "subject to the

UNITED STATES v. ERIE RAILROAD.
236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

provisions of the act," and the number of times they are
so used is compared. It will do no good to set forth the
instances. The act was passed to regulate the conduct
and affairs of the carriers of the country, and necessarily
they are brought under its provisions and subject to them.
It controls their relations, but the carriers subject to the
act may have relation with other carriers, and special
provisions would naturally be made to govern that relation. And certainly the reasoning is not impressive which
justifies an interchange of passes between carriers subject
to the act and denies it to those not so subject, the same
business reasons existing in both cases.
Counsel for the United States sounds an alarm at such
extension and lets imagination loose in portrayal of its
consequences and sees included "tap lines and other industrial railroads, street car lines, local traction companies,
omnibus transfer companies and herdic lines, hackmen,
boatmen, ferrymen, truckmen, lumber flumes, bucket
lines for ore, parcel deliveries, district messenger services,
carriers of all descriptions, both in this country and
abroad"*a formidable enumeration, it must be admitted.
And there must be included, too, all their officers, all
their employs and their families. There is, however,
an opposing picture. It is conceded that carriers subject
to the act may interchange passes, the officers and employ6s of each carrier receiving free transportation, and
giving it to every other carrier subject to the act, making
an army of the privileged with the same discrimination
and the same burden on the passenger service of the railroads as in the illustration of the Government. There
is no argument, therefore, in a comparison of the possibilities under one construction rather than the other. At
best it is but a comparison of the excesses which may be
but are not likely to be practiced. Counsel seem to think
that the railroads have an eager desire to distribute passes
and burden their transportation service with a crowd of

free passengers. Congress certainly had no such view
and gave power to exchange passes, considering that the
best safeguard against its abuse was the interest of the
carriers. The cases at bar are a typical instance of its
exercise. It has its justification in a strictly business
policy, and instead of being a burden upon the resources
of the companies it is an aid to them. With these examples before us, and in view of the other reasons which
we have adduced, we see no reason to disregard the
literal terms of the statute. And this view is strengthened, not weakened, by the proviso inserted on June 18,
1910, which is as follows:
"And provided further, That this provision shall not
be construed to prohibit the privilege of passes or franks,
or the exchange thereof with each other, for
employ~s . . . of such telegraph, telephone and
cable lines, and the . . . employ6s . . . of other
common carriers subject to the provisions of this act."
(36 Stat. 539, 546, c. 309.)
In such case the statute makes a special limitation,
as will be observed; in other words, restricts the privilege
of exchanging telegraph and telephone franks for employ6s, etc., of such lines and of other common carriers
subject to the act-that is, there are words of explicit
limitation.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of the case.
