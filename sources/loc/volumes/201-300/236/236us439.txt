in the report, and counsel for the plaintiff ought not to
have asked more. But we need not fix the responsibility
for what occurred, for it is certain that the defendant was
not harmed by it. The case made by the evidence rightly
admitted was such as, in the absence of any opposing evidence, and there was none, clearly entitled the plaintiff
to a verdict for the amount claimed. Every fact essential
to a recovery, save the service of the reparation order and
the refusal to comply with it, was prima facie established
by the findings and order of the Commission and these
could not be rejected by the jury in the absence of any
countervailing evidence. Kelly v. Jackson, 6 Pet. 622,
632. The service of the order was expressly admitted
and the refusal to comply with it was fully proved and
practically conceded. Of course, harmless error constitutes no ground for reversal.
We conclude, therefore, that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the
District Court must be modified by eliminating the allowance of an attorney's fee of $2,500 for services before
the Commission and affirmed as so modified.
It is so ordered.

two sovereignties so that punishment by one does not prevent punishment by the other, only relates to cases where both sovereignties
have jurisdiction over the act. It has no application where one of
the governments has exclusive jurisdiction of the subject-matter and
therefore has the exclusive power to punish.
Under the Federal Constitution the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce is such that when exercised it is exclusive and
ipso facto supersedes existing state legislation on the same subject.
Congress may so circumscribe its regulations in regard to a matter
within its exclusive jurisdiction as to occupy only a limited field
and leave a part of the subject open to incidental legislation by the
States; but the Safety Appliance Act extended to the whole subject
of equipping cars with safety appliances to the exclusion of further
action by the States.
The Indiana statute requiring railway companies to place grab-irons
and hand-holds on the sides and ends of every car having been superseded by the Federal Safety Appliance Act, penalties imposed
by the former cannot be recovered as to cars operated on interstate
railroads although engaged only in intrastate traffic.
THE facts, which involve the effect of the Federal
Safety Appliance Act on state statutes relating to safety
appliances on railroad cars used in interstate commerce,
are stated in the opinion.

v. Emmonds, 149 U. S. 364.
In order that a state law or the action of state authorities under such law should be construed a regulation of
commerce between the States, the operation of such law
or the action of such state authorities must be a direct
interference or regulation and directly or substantially
hurtful to such commerce, not a mere incidental or casual
interruption or regulation or remotely hurtful. Sherlock v.

So long as the action of the State is not repugnant to,
or does not interfere with, or place burdens upon, or undertake to regulate, interstate commerce, or is a mere police
regulation, its action, though in aid of interstate commerce,
is not invalid, unless it is a direct interference. Savage v.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.
The Indiana statute requires railway companies to
place secure grab-irons and hand-holds on the sides or
ends of every railroad car, under a penalty of $100 fine
to be recovered in a civil action.
In March, 1910, the Railroad Commission of the State
brought such a suit against the Southern Railway Company, alleging that the Company on February 24, 1910,
had transported from Boonville, Indiana, to Milltown,

SOUTHERN RY. CO. v. R. R. COMM., INDIANA. 445
236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Indiana, a car which did not have the required equipment.
The defendant filed an answer in which it denied liability
under the state law inasmuch as on February 24, 1910,
the Federal Safety Appliance Act imposed penalties for
failing to equip cars with hand-holds and also designated
the court in which they might be recovered. The Commission's demurrer to the answer was sustained. The
defendant refusing to plead further, judgment was ,entered against the "Company. That judgment was affirmed by the state court and the case was brought here
by writ of error.
The car alleged to have been without the required equipment, though transporting freight between points wholly
within the State of Indiana, was moving on a railroad
engaged in interstate commerce and the Company was,
therefore, subject to the provisions and penalties of the
Safety Appliance Act. 27 Stat. 531, § 4. Southern Railway v. United States, 222 U. S. 20.
The defendant in error insists, however, that the Railroad Company was also liable for the penalty imposed
by the Indiana statute. In support of this position numerous cases are cited-which, like Cross v. North Carolina,
132 U. S. 131, hold that the same act may- constitute a
criminal offense against two sovereignties, and that punishment by gne does not prevent punishment by the
other. That doctrine is thoroughly established. But,
upon an analysis of the principle on which it is founded,
it will be found to relate only to cases where the act sought
to be punished is one over which both sovereignties have
jurisdiction. This concurrent jurisdiction may be either
because the nature of the act is such that at the same time
it produces effects respectively within the sphere of state
and Federal regulation and thus violates the laws of
both; or, where there is this double effect in a matter of
which one can exercise control but an authoritative declaration that the paramount jurisdiction of one shall not

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

236 U. S.

exclude that of the other. Compare, R. S., § 711; 37 Stat.
670.
But the principle that the offender may, for one act,
be prosecuted in two jurisdictions has no application
where one of the governments has exclusive jurisdiction
of the subject-matter and therefore the exclusive power
to punish. Such is the case here where Congress, in the
exercise of -its power to regulate interstate commerce,
has legislated as to the appliances with which certain
instrumentalities of that commerce must be furnished
in order to secure the safety of employ6s. Until Congress
entered that field the States could legislate as to equipment in such manner as to incidentally affect, without
burdening interstate commerce. But Congress could
pass the Safety Appliance Act only because of the fact
that the equipment of cars moving on interstate roads
was a regulation of interstate commerce. Under the
Constitution the nature of that power is such that when
exercised it is exclusive, and ipso facto, supersedes existing state legislation on the same subject. Congress of
course could have "circumscribed its regulations" so as
to occupy a limited field. Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501,
533. Atlantic Line v. Georgia, 234 U. S. 280, 293. But
so far as it did legislate, the exclusive effect of the Safety
Appliance Act did not relate merely to details of the
statute and the penalties it imposed, but extended to
the whole subject of equipping cars with appliances intended for the protection of employ~s. The States thereafter could not legislate so as to. require greater or less
or different equipment; nor could they punish by imposing
greater or less or different penalties. For, as said in
Prigg v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617:
"If Congress have a constitutional power to regulate a
particular subject, and they do actually regulate it in a
given manner, and in a certain form, it cannot be that
the state legislatures have a right to interfere; and, as

SOUTHERN RY. CO. v. R. R. COMM., INDIANA. 447
236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it were, by way of complement to the legislation of Congress, to prescribe additional regulations, and what they
may deem auxiliary provisions for the same purpose. In
such a case, the legislation of Congress, in what it does
prescribe, manifestly indicates that it does not intend
that there shall be any farther legislation to act upon the
subject-matter. Its silence as to what it does not do,
is as expressive of what its intention is as the direct provisions made by it . . . the will of Congress upon
the whole subject is as clearly established by what it had
not declared, as by what it has expressed."
Without, therefore, discussing the many cases sustaining the right of the States to legislate on subjects
which, while not burdening, may yet incidentally affect
interstate commerce, it is sufficient here to say that Congress has so far occupied the field of legislation relating
to the equipment of freight cars with safety appliances
as to supersede existing and prevent further legislation
on that subject. The principle is too well established .to
require argument. Its application may be seen in rulings
in the closely analogous cases relating to state penalties
for failing to furnish cars and to state penalties for retaining employ6s at work on cars beyond the time allowed by the Hours-of-Service Law.
In St. L., Iron Mt. & S. Ry. v. Hampton, 227 U. S. 267,
it was held that the Arkansas statute imposing a penalty
for failing to deliver cars had been superseded by the
provisions of the Hepburn Act, although the provisions
of the two statutes were not identical. In Northern Pacific Ry. v. Washington, 222 U. S. 371, it was held that
congressional legislation as to hours-of-service so completely occupied the field as to prevent state legislation
on that subject. In Erie R. R. v, New York, 233 U. S.671,
a like ruling was made in a case where the New York law
punished a Railroad Company for allowing an employ6
to work more than eight hours when the Federal statute

Syllabus.

236 U. S.

punished the Company for employing him for more than
nine hours-even though it was argued that the state
legislation was not in conflict with the Federal act, but
rather in aid of it. The same contention is made here
inasmuch as the Indiana law requires hand-holds on sides
or ends of cars, while the Federal statute requires handholds to be placed both on the sides and ends of cars.
The test, however, is not whether the state legislation
is in conflict with the details of the Federal law or supplements it, but whether the State had any jurisdiction of a
subject over which Congress had exerted its exclusive
control. The Safety Appliance Act having superseded
the Indiana statute the judgment imposing the penalty.
must be reversed, and the case remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

No. 146.

Argued January 22, 1915.-Decided February 23, 1915.

This court cannot entertain argument based on the theory that the
decision of the highest court of the State is in conflict with the law
of the State.
The ruling of the highest court of the State as to enforcement of a
vendor's statutory lien is a matter of state law not reversible by
this court.
Where the vendor attached within four months, alleging a vendor's
lien under the state statute, and the state court holds that the proceedings under the vendor's lien failed for want of possession, the
lien is simply that created by ordinary attachment and garnishment
and is dissolved by the express provisions of § 67f of the Bankruptcy
Act.
