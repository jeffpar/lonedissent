maintained by such of the carriers as had occasion to
establish interstate switching rates. But if this were
doubtful the order is to be read with the report. Georgia
Public Service Comm'n v' United States, supra, 771;
American Express Co. v. Caldwell, supra, 627. So read
there can be no doubt that it was intended to prescribe
for all intrastate traffic within the District the same rate
as that prescribed for all interstate traffic there, and that
interstate carriers whose rails aro confined to either state
and which for that reason have filed no interstate: switching rates are nevertheless required to adopt the prescribed
intrastate rate.
Appellants also urge that interstate carriers whose rails
reach only the Illinois part of the District cannot be required to remove a discrimination against interstate commerce unless they participate in both the prejudicial and
preferential rates, as was said in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.
v. United States, 289 U.S. 627, with respect to discriminations between localities forbidden by § 3 of the Act.
But this restriction has no relevance to proceedings under
§ 13 (4) directed to the removal of discriminatory intrastate rates maintained by state authority. By that section the Interstate- Commerce Commission is expressly
authorized to prescribe the intrastate rates which will
remove the discrimination.

No. 786.

Argued May 3, 1934.-Decided May 28, 1934.

1. The Conformity Act, 28 U.S.C. 724, requires that the form of a
law action in a federal court and the right in which it may be
brought shall be determined by the local law, but it does not apply
to substantive questions upon which the local procedure may
depend. P. 492.

2. Under the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. 725, the applicable
state statute furnishes the rule of decision for a federal court
sitting within or outside of the State, and must be given the meaning and effect attributed to it by the highest court of the State, as
if the state court's decision was literally incorporated into the enactment. P. 493.
3. There is no valid distinction in this respect between an Act which
alters the common law and one which codifies or declares it, such as
the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; nor between a statute
prescribing rules of commercial law and one concerned with some
other subject of narrower scope. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, considered; Watson v. Tarpley, 18 How. 517, 521, limited. P. 495.
4. The negotiability of a promissory note made and payable in
Florida, held to depend upon the Florida Negotiable Instruments
Law. P. 495.
5. In the absence of construction by the Florida court, it was the
duty of the federal courts in this case (tried in Pennsylvania) *to
decide the question of negotiability according to the accepted
canons and in the light of the decisions of the courts of other
States with respect to the same sections of the Negotiable Instruments Law. P. 496.
6. Promissory notes provided for interest on the principal sum at
the rate of 7% per annum from date until paid and for payment
of interest semi-annually, and added that deferred interest payments should bear interest from maturity at 10% per annum, payable semi-annually. Held that the word "maturity" refers to the
due dates of interest and not to date for payment of principal;
that there is, therefore, no ambiguity with respect to the rate of
interest; and that the notes are negotiable. Pp. 496, 497.

Jockmus v. Claussen & Knight, 47 F. (2d) 766.
The passage of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments
Act by a State should not have the effect of abrogating
the rule of Swift v. Tyson; on the contrary, it furnishes
an additional reason for adherence to that rule.
The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law was urged
upon and adopted by the *States with the same idea of
uniformity in mind. It was not intended to supplant or
to change principles of commercial law as they were recognized throughout the commercial world, but to reenact or
codify the settled and established principles familiar to
those engaged in commercial enterprises. Taylor v. American Nat. Bank, 63 Fla. 631, 649.
As interpreted in Swift v. Tyson, the Constitution gives
to litigants privileged to use the federal courts the right
to have questions of general commercial law determined
by those courts after an independent investigation of the
principles of commercial law applicable to the situation.
One particular weakness of petitioner's position lies in
the fact that it presupposes a definite fixity of interpretation by the state courts.
Assuming that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in
applying general commercial law, such error was harmless, as it would be compelledto apply Pennsylvania law,
the law of the forum, to the procedural question involved,
and the Pennsylvania law accords with that found by the
court to be general commercial law.
The law of Florida has not definitely determined that a
note like those in suit is negotiable under the Florida
Negotiable Instruments Law.
The court below, in refusing to be bound by the Florida
statute and its interpretation, did not violate the full faith
and credit clause of the Constitution.
Under general commercial law, the notes in question are
relidered non-negotiable because of uncertainty as to the

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This writ brings here for review a judgment entered by
the District Court for eastern Pennsylvania in an action
on six instruments, each promising the payment of $1000,
all of even date and like tenor. They were executed and
delivered by the respondent at Miami, Florida, and were
there payable to Golden Isles Corporation at intervals of
six months, the first falling due six months from August
28, 1925, and the last, three years from that date. Prior
to maturity the payee endorsed and delivered them to
one Williamson, who, after refusal of payment at maturity, transferred them by delivery to the petitioner. In
response to the petitioner's statement of claim the respondent filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a
statutory demurrer, asserting that as the writings did not
embody a promise to pay a sum certain they were not
negotiable notes.
The District Judge followed the decisions of the Pennsylvania courts to the effect that the holder of negotiable
paper, whether he obtained title before or after dishonor,
may sue in his own name,1 but a holder must sue as useplaintiff in the name of the obligee if the instrument is not

negotiable.' Concluding that the notes were not negotiable
and consequently the petitioner could sue only in the
name of Golden Isles Corporation, he sustained the affidavit of defense, and, as the petitioner refused to amend,
entered judgment for the respondent. The Court of
Appeals affirmed.'
The provisions held to create the uncertainty which
deprived the notes of negotiability, were: "with interest
thereon [the principal sum] at the rate of 7 per cent per
annum from .date until fully paid. Interest payable semiannually. . . . Deferred interest payments to bear interest from maturity at ten per cent per annum, payable
semi-annually."
The petitioner urged that as Florida had adopted the
Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law the federal courts
were bound to decide the issue according to that statute as
interpreted by the Florida court of last resort; the respondent insisted as the action was in the District Court
sitting in Pennsylvania, which had also adopted the Uniform Act, the statute as interpreted by the courts of that
state must be applied. The Circuit Court of Appeals
held that it need not adopt the construction of the Act
by the courts of either state, but should decide the case
upon the general principles of the law merchant. From
these it concluded the quoted provisions rendered the*
instruments uncertain as to the amount payable and
therefore non-negotiable.
1. The conformity act" required the trial court to apply the local law in matters of procedure. The form of
action and the right in which it must be brought were
therefore governed by the Pennsylvania practice. But
the procedural question turned on another of substance,
namely, whether the instruments were negotiable.

2. The negotiable quality of the notes is to be ascertained by reference to the law of Florida.5 The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law adopted in that State
provides' (§ 1) that,
"An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the
following requirements:
"2. Must contain an unconditional promise or order'to
pay a sum certain in money."
And by § 2 it is declared:
"The sum payable is a sum certain within the meaning
of this Act, although it is to be paid: (1) With interest;
or (2) By stated installments; or (3) By stated installments, with a provision that upon the default in' payment of any installment or of interest, the whole shall
become due; . .
Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 directs that the
laws of the several states, except where the Constitution,
treaties or statutes of the United States otherwise require
or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials
at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases
where they apply.' The applicable state statute furnishes
the rule of decision for a federal court sitting in the
state 8 or outside its borders.' And in that court the law

must be given the meaning and effect attributed to it by
the highest court of the state, as if the state court's decision were literally incorporated into the enactment, whatever the federal tribunal's opinion as to the correctness of
the state court's views." The petitioner says the Supreme
Court Qf Florida has construed the pertinent sections of
the Negotiable Instruments Law as declaring writings of
the tenor of those in suit to be negotiable, and the courts
below were, therefore, bound so to rule. The Circuit
Court of Appeals, however, held that the construction by
a state court of last resort of a state statuite which is
merely declaratory of the common law or law merchant
does not bind federal courts. It ascribed that character
to the Uniform Act and refused to consider as conclusive
the Florida decision upon which the petitioner relied.
The court referred to several opinions which sustain this
position.'
It recognized that the opposing view also

Opinion of the Court.

We think the better view is that there is no valid distinction in this respect between an act which alters the
common law and one which codifies or declares it. Both
are within the letter of § 34 of the Judiciary Act (supra).
And a declaratory act is no less an expression of the
legislative will because the rule it prescribes is the same
as that announced in prior, decisions of the courts of the
state. Nor is there a difference in this respect between
a statute prescribing rules of commercial law and one concerned with some other subject of narrower scope. The
contention of the respondent that this court announced a
contraryview in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, is not sustained
by a careful reading of the opinion in that case. 3 We are
referred to certain expressions found in Watson v. Tarpley, 18 How. 517, at page 521. What was there said on
the subject was unnecessary to the decision, and has not
been followed in later cases. The Florida Negotiable
Instruments Law, as construed by the Supreme Court of
the State, furnishes the rule of decision by which the
negotiable character of the notes is to be determined.
3. The petitioner asserts that in Taylor v. American
National Bank of Pensacola,63 Fla. 631; 57 So. 678, the

supreme court of that State construed the statute so as to
make negotiable an instrument of the tenor of those in
suit. The note involved .in that case was payable two
years after date with interest from date at the rate of eight
per cent. per annum, interest payable quarter-annually,
and was held to be negotiable, § 2 of the Uniform Act
being quoted. The decision is a clear authority that
uzider the Act the provision for periodical payment of
the Uniform Negotiable Instrunments Law. See: Kobey v. Hoffman,
229 Fed. 486, 488; Crittenden v. Widrevitz, 272 Fed. 871; Mack v.
Dailey, 3 F. (2d) 534, .538; Gutelius v. Stanbon, 39 F. (2d) 621;

interest before the due date of the principal does not
destroy negotiability. As the note did not provide for
interest on deferred interest paymients, either at the same
or a different rate from that named as payable upon principal, the effect of such a stipulation was not decided.
Upon this matter, therefore, the case cannot be said to be
an authority by which the Circuit Court of Appeals was
bound.
4. The absence of a decision by the Supreme Court of
the State did not relieve the courts below from applying
the Florida statute. Lacking such authoritative construction, their duty was to determine the question according to the accepted canons and in the light of the
decisions of the courts of other states with respect to the
same sections of the Negotiable Instruments Law."
If, as is admitted, the court of last resort of the state
holds that provision for payment of interest in instalments prior to maturity of principal does not render the
sum payable so uncertain as to destroy negotiability, we
think an added stipulation that overdue interest shall
bear interest at a named rate until paid would not call for
a different decision. Courts which have had occasion' to
consider the effect of the Act upon instruments of like
tenor, have uniformly pronounced them negotiable. 5
And cases decided prior to the adoption of the Act are to
the same effect.'" No contrary decision has been brought

to our notice. Until the Supreme Court of Florida holds
otherwise, we are justified in construing the Act in accordance with what we think its intent, especially as this
construction accords with the views of the courts of other
states.
5. The respondent urges that the notes are so ambiguous with respect to the rate of interest that they do not
call for the payment of a sum certain, and must therefore
be held not to be negotiable. First National Bank of
Miami v. Bosler, 297 Pa. 353, is cited as sustaining this position. The note there under consideration stipulated for
eight per cent. per annum upon the principal, "from date
until fully paid. Interest payable semi-annually. ...
Deferred payments are to bear interest from maturity
at ten per cent per annum semi-annually." The decision against negotiability rested upon the proposition
that the two interest provisions were so inconsistent that
one reading the note could not ascertain at which rate
interest was payable on overdue principal. The decision
has been criticized, Lessen v. Lindsey, 238 App. Div.
(N.Y.) 262; 264 N.Y.S. 391, on the ground that ambiguity alone does not destroy negotiability, but requires
merely a construction of the instrument and a determination of which of two inconsistent clauses shall control.
But, be this as it may, the notes in the present case are,
we think, free from ambiguity. They provide for interest
on the principal sum at the rate of seven per cent. per
annum from date until fully paid, for interest payable
semi-annually, and add that deferred interest payments
shall bear interest from maturity at ten per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually. While, therefore, the principal is to bear interest at seven per cent, overdue interest
is to be paid with interest at ten per cent. The word
"maturity" seems obviously to refer to the due dates
of interest and not to the date for payment of principal.

APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 868.

Argued May 8, 1934.-Decided May 28, 1934.

The Interstate Commerce Commission found that intrastate rates on
bituminous' coal from certain mining districts in southeastern Ohio
to destinations in the northeastern portion 'of the State, as reduced by order or permission of the Public Utilities Commission
of the State, were substantially lower, distance considered, than
interstate rates on such coal moving to the same destinations from
districts in Pennsylvania and West Virginia; that the interstate rates
from the latter districts were reasonable; that the system of
differentials between the Ohio origins and the more remote otherState origins was proper, distance and other conditions considered;
that 'the reduced Ohio rates were unduly preferential of persons
and localities in Ohio and unduly prejudicial to persons and
localities in the Pennsylvania and West Virginia districts; and
that to remove such discrimination, the intrastate rates should be
increased to their former level and the preexisting interrelationship
reestablished. In a suit to annul the resulting order, held:
1. Objection that the Commission did not afford a fair hearing
is based on excerpts from its report, taken out of their connection,
and is disproved by an examination of the record, report and findings. P. 505.
2. There was ample evidence before the Commission to sustain
the finding of undue prejudice against interstate shippers and
localities. P. 506..
3. It is not required of the Commission that, before it can remove undue prejudice caused by intrastate rates to districts of
origin in other nearby States whose rates are under consideration
and found reasonable, it must find or make reasonable other interstate rates to the destination in question, which are adjusted on a
