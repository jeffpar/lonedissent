OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 727 and 728. Argued April 3, 1934.-Decided April 30, 1934.
1. Where accounts and income tax returns are on the accrual basis,
a debt owing the taxpayer for goods sold in the tax year is returnable as gross income of that year even though ascertained in that
year to be partly worthless. Art. 35 of Regs. 45, under Revenue
Act of 1918, construed. P. 184.
2. Section 234 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1918 authorized the
deduction of a debt ascertained to be worthless and charged off
within the taxable year; it did not authorize the deduction of the
whole or a part of a debt ivhich was not then ascertained to be
worthless but was recoverable in part, the amount that was
recoverable being still uncertain. P. 185.
3. Section 234 (a)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1918, providing for
deduction of "losses sustained during the taxable year," and subdivision (5) of the same section providing for deduction of debts
ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year, are mutually
exclusive; and a debt excluded from deduction under (5) can not
be deducted as a loss under (4). P. 189.
4. If a statute is ambiguous, administrative construction followed
since its enactment is of great weight. P. 189.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Richard H. Tyrrell and Edgar L. Wood for
petitioner.
Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, and Messrs.
James W. Morris and Carlton Fox were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
Petitions for writs of certiorari were granted, "limited
to the question whether a debt ascertained to be partially
worthless in 1920 was deductible in that year under either
ยง 234 (a) (4) or ยง 234 (a) (5) [of the Revenue Act, of
1918] and to the question whether the debt was returnable as taxable income in that year to the extent that it
was then ascertained to be worthless." 291 U.S. 656.
Petitioner kept its books during the year 1920 and filed
its income tax return for that year on the accrual basis.
From March, 1920, to September, 1920, petitioner sold
goods to the Cotta Transmission Company for which the
latter became indebted in the amount of $39,983.27, represented by open account and unsecured notes. In the
latter part of 1920 the Cotta Company found itself in
financial straits. Efforts at settlement having failed, a
. petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Company
on December 23, 1920, and a receiver was appointed.
In the spring of 1922 the receiver paid to creditors, including petitioner, a dividend of 15 per cent. and, in 1923,
a second and final dividend of 121/., per cent.
Petitioner charged off on its books the entire debt on
December 28, 1920, and claimed this amount as a deduction in its income tax return for that year. It included
as income in its returns for 1922 and 1923 the dividends
received in those years. The Commissioner disallowed
the amount claimed as a deduction in 1920 but allowed a

deduction in 1923 of $28,715.76, the difference between
the full amount of the debt and the two dividends.
On review of the deficiency assessed by the Commissioner for 1920, the Board of Tax Appeals found that the
debt was not entirely worthless at the time it was charged
off. An offer had been made in November, 1920, to purchase the assets of the debtor at 331/3 per cent. of the
creditors'- claims and the offer had been declined. The
Board concluded that in view of all the circumstances,
including the probable expense of the receivership, the
debt could be regarded as uncollectible, at the time of
the charge-off, to the extent of $28,715.76, and allowed a
deduction for 1920 of that amount. 25 B.T.A. 822. This
ruling, contested by both the Commissioner and the taxpayer, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon.
the ground that "there was in 1920 no authority for a
debt deduction unless the debt were worthless." 67 F.
(2d) '385, 387. In view of the conflict of decisions upon
this point,' this Court granted writs of certiorari limited
as above stated.
1. Petitioner first contends that the debt, to the extent
that ft was ascertained in 1920 to be worthless, was not
returnable as gross income in that year, that is, apart
from any question of deductions, it was not to be regarded
as taxable income at all. We see no merit in this contention. Keeping accounts and making returns on the
accrual basis, as distinguished from the cash basis, import that it is the right to receive and not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of the amount in gross
income. When the right to receive an amount becomes

fixed, the right accrues. When a merchandising concern
makes sales, its inventory is reduced and a claim for the
purchase price arises. Article 35 of Regulations 45 under
the Revenue Act of 1918 provided: "In the case of a
manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business 'gross
income' means the total sales, less the cost of goods sold,
plus any income from investments and from incidental or
outside operations or sources." ' On an accrual basis, the "total sales," to which the
regulation refers, are manifestly the accounts receivable
arising from the sales, and these accounts receivable, less
the cost of. the goods sold, figure in the statement of gross
income. If such accounts receivable become uncollectible,
in whole or part, the question is one of the deduction
which may be taken according to the applicable statute.
See United States v. Anderson, 2 9 U.S. 422, 440,'441;
American National Co. v. United States, 274 U.S. 99, 102,
103; Brown v. Helvering, 291 U.S. 193, 199; Rouss v.
Bowers, 30 F. (2d) 628; 629. That is the question here.
It is not altered by the fact that the claim of loss relates
to an item of gross income which had accrued in the same
year.
2. Section 234 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provided for the deduction of worthless debts, in computing
net income, as follows:-",, Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year." Under this
provision, the taxpayer could not establish a right to the
deduction simply by charging off the debt. It must be
ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year. In
this instance, in 1920, the debt was in suspense by reason
of the bankruptcy of the debtor but it was not a total loss.
What eventually might be recovered upon it was uncertain, but recovery to some extent was reasonably to be

expected. The receiver continued the business and substantial amounts were subsequently realized for the creditors. In this view, the Board of Tax Appeals decided
that the petitioner did not sustain a loss in 1920 "equal
to the total amount of the debt" and lience that the
entire debt was not deductible in that year.
The question, then, is whether petitioner was entitled to
a deduction in 1920 for the portion of the debt which
ultimately-on the winding up in bankruptcy-proved to
be uncollectible. Such a deduction of a part of the debt,
the Government contends and the Circuit Court of Appeals held, the Act of 1918 did not authorize. The Government points to the literal meaning of the words of
the statute, to the established administrative construction, and to the action of the Congress in recognition of
that construction. "Worthless," says the Government,
means destitute of worth, of no value or use. This was
the interpretation of the statute by the Treasury Department. Article 151 of Regulations 45 (made applicable to
corporations by Article 561) provided that "An account
merely written down" is not deductible.' To the same
effect was the corresponding provision of the regulations
under the Revenue Act of 1916.
' Article 151 of Regulations 45 provided: "Bad debts.-An account
merely written down or a debt recognized as worthless prior to the
beginning of the taxable year is not deductib:e. Where all the surrounding and attendant circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless
and uncollectible and that legal action to enforce payment would in
all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for the purpose of deduction. Bankruptcy may
or may not be an indication of the worthlessness of a debt, and actual
determination of worthlessness in such a case is sometimes possible
before and at other times only when a settlement in bankruptcy shall
have been had. .. "

Opinion of the Court.

The right to charge off and deduct a portion of a debt
where during the taxable year the debt was found to be
recoverable only in part, was granted by the Act of 1921.
By that Act, ยง 234 (a) (5) was changed so as to read:
" Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within
the taxable year (or in the discretion of the Commissioner,
a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts); and
when satisfied that a debt is recoverable only in part, the
Commissioner may allow such debt to be charged off in
part." We think that the fair import of this provision.
as contrasted with the earlier one, is that the Congress,
recognizing the significance of the existing provision and
its appropriate construction by the Treasury Department,
deliberately intended a change in the law. Shwab v.
Doyle, 258 U.S. 529, 536; Russell v. United States, 278
U.S. 181, 188.
This intent is shown clearly by the statement in the
report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House
of Representatives in relation to the new provision. The
Committee said explicitly--" Under the present law
worthless debts are deductible in full or not at all."
While the change was struck out by the Finance Committee of the Senate, the provision was restored on the
floor of the Senate and became a law as proposed by the
House.' Regulations 62 issued by the Treasury Depart'H.Rep. No. 350, 67th Cong., 1st sess., p. 11. The statement of the
Committee is: " Under the present law worthless debts are deductible
in full or not at all, but Section 214 would authorize the Commissioner
to permit a deduction for debts recoverable only in part, or in his
discretion to recognize a reserve for bad debts-a method of providing
for bad debts much less subject to abuse than the method of writing
off bad debts required by the present law." Section 214 related to
deductions by individuals and contained the same new provision as
that inserted in ยง 234 (a) (5), quoted in the text, with respect to
deductions by corporations.

ment under the Act of 1921 made a corresponding change
in Article 151. The Treasury Department consistently
adhered to the former rule in dealing with deductions
sought under the Act of 1918.1
In numerous decisions the Board of Tax Appeals has
taken the same view of the provision of the Act of 1918.8
See e.g., Appeal of Steele Cotton Mill Co., 1 B.T.A. 299,
302; Western Casket Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A. 792,
797; Toccoa Furniture Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A.
804, 805. The contrary result in the instant case was
reached in deference to the opinions expressed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in Sherman
& Bryan, Inc. v. Commissioner, 35 F. (2d) 713, 716, and
by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in
Davidson Grocery Co. v. Lucas, 59 App.D.C. 176; 37 F.
(2d) 806, 808,-views which are opposed to those of the
Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit in Minnehaha National Bank v. Commissioner, 28 F. (2d) 763, 764.
and of the Fifth Circuit in Collin County National Bank
v. Commissioner, 48 F. (2d) 207, 208.
We are of opinion that ยง 234 (a) (5) of the Act of 1918
authorized only the deduction of a debt ascertained to be
worthless and charged off within the taxable year; that it
'In Treasury decision 3262, I-1, Cumulative Bulletin, JanuaryJune, 1922, 152, 153, it was said: "No deduction shall be allowed for
the part of a debt ascertained to be worthless and charged off prior
to January 1, 1921, unless and until the debt is ascertained to be
totally worthless and is finally charged off or charged down to 7
nominal amount, or the loss is determined in some other manner by
a closed and completed transaction." See, also, A.R.R. 7895, 111-2,
Cumulative Bulletin, July-December, 1924, 114, 115; A.R.R. 8226,
111-2, Cumulative Bulletin, 116, 119-121.
*The members of the Board of Tax Appeals who dissented in the
instant case pointed out that the Board had "consistently held in at
least twenty-three cases that under the Revenue Act of 1918 no deduction may be taken where a taxpayer ascertains that a debt is
recoverable only in part." 25 B.T.A., p. 834.

Opinion of the Court.

did not authorize the deduction of a debt which was not
then ascertained to be worthless but was recoverable in
part, the amount that was not recoverable being still uncertain. Here, in 1923, on the winding up, the debt that
then remained unpaid, after deducting the dividends received, was ascertained to be worthless and the Commissioner allowed deduction accordingly in that year.
3. Petitioner also claims the right of deduction under
ยง 234 (a) (4) of the Act of 1918 providing for the deduction of "Losses sustained during the taxable year and not
compensated for by insurance or otherwise." We agree
with the decision below that this subdivision and the following subdivisian (5) relating to debts are mutually exclusive. We so assumed, without deciding the point, in
Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., 275 U.S. 243, 246.
The making of the specific provision as to debts indicates
that these were to be considered as a special class and that
losses on debts were not to be regarded as falling under
the preceding general provision. What was excluded from
deduction under subdiviiion (5) cannot be regarded as
allowed under subdivision (4). If subdivision (4) could
be considered as ambiguous in this respect, the administrative construction which has been followed from the
enactment of the statute-that subdivision (4) did not
refer to debts-would be entitled to great weight.' We
see no reason for disturbing that construction.
Petitioner insists that "good business practice" forbade
the inclusion in the taxpayer's assets of the account receivable in question or at least the part of it which was siabsequently found to be uncollectible. But that is not the
question here. Questions relating to allowable deductions under the income tax act are quite distinct from
matters which pertain to an appropriate showing upon

which credit is sought. It would have been proper for
the taxpayer to carry the debt in question in a suspense
account awaiting the ultimate determination of the
amount that could be realized upon it, and thus to indicate the status of the debt in financial statements of the
taxpayer's condition. But that proper practice, in order
to advise those from whom credit might be sought of
uncertainties in the realization of assets, does not affect
the construction of the statute, or make the debt deducti5le in 1920, when the entire debt was not worthless, when
the amount which would prove uncollectible was not yet
ascertained, rather than in 1923 when that amount was
ascertained and its deduction allowed.
We conclude that the ruling of the Circuit Court of
Appeals was correct.
