CHARLES ILFELD CO. v. HERNANDEZ, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 579.

Argued March 8, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.

Section 141 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 gives groups of affiliated corporations the privilege of making consolidated returns,
in lieu of separate ones, for 1929 and subsequent years, upon condition that all members consent to the regulations prescribed prior
to the return. Section 141 (b) authorizes the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to make regulations for determining the tax liability of an
affiliated group and of each member in such manner as clearly to
reflect the income and prevent avoidance of tax liability. Held:
. 1. The making of a consolidated return of income on the part
of affiliated corporations, was a "consent" to the regulations pre-

scribed prior to the return.

P. 65.

2. Deduction of a loss, in an income tax return, is not allowable
unless the relevant act and regulations fairly may be read to
authorize it. P. 66.
3. Where a parent company during a consolidated return period
caused the property of two affiliates, of which it held all the stock,
to be sold to outsiders, received a distribution of the net proceeds
after payment of their outside debts, and then dissolved the affiliated corporations, the losses represented by the difference between the amount of the distribution and what it had lent the
affiliates and paid for their stock in prior years were losses upon a
distribution within the consolidated return period and arising from
intercompany transactions, and not from a sale of stock, within

the meaning of Regulations 75, adopted pursuant to the above
cited Act, and, under those Regulations they were not deductible
in the consolidated return. Pp. 66-67.
4. The Act and Regulations are not to be construed as permitting double deduction of the same losses, first as subsidiary
company losses in consolidated returns for earlier years, and again
in stating the eventual loss to the parent company from its investment in the subsidiaries. P. 68.

Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Norman D. Keller were on the brief, for
respondent.
By leave of Court, briefs of amici curiae were filed as

MR. JusTIcE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1917 petitioner purchased all the capital stock of the
Springer Trading Company for $40,000 and in 1920 all
that of the Roy Trading Company for $50,000. It held
these shares until late in 1929 when both companies were
dissolved. In that period it advanced the Springer Company sums amounting to $69,030.27, and the Roy Company $9,782.22. Nothing having been paid it on account
of these advances, petitioner had an investment in the

former of $109,030.27 and in the latter of $59,782.22. It
made consolidated returns which took into account the
gains and losses of each subsidiary. Operations of the
Springer Company resulted in losses in all but two of the
years and those of the Roy Company in all but four. The
losses of the former exceeded its gains by $118,510.53, and
those of the latter by $57,127.85. In 1929, before the end
of November, the subsidiaries sold all their property to
outside interests. After paying debts to others, each had
a balance-the Springer Company, $22,914.22, and the
Roy Company, $15,106.16-which it paid petitioner on
December 23. Both subsidiaries were dissolved December 30 in that year.
Petitioner made a consolidated return for 1929 based
on the results of operation and the liquidation of each
subsidiary but made no deduction of losses resulting to itself from the liquidations. The return showed a tax of
$20,836.20 which was duly paid. In May, 1931, petitioner filed an amended return and claimed a refund of
$14,406.43. This return does not take into account profits
or losses of subsidiaries in that year but deducts the losses
above shown to have resulted to petitioner from its investments in them.* The commissioner rejected the
claim. Petitioner brought this action in the federal district court for New Mexico against the collector to recover
the amount of its claim. A jury was waived, the court
made special findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law

and gave petitioner judgment as prayed. The Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed. 66 F. (2d) 236. 67 F. (2d)
236.
The question is whether petitioner is entitled to deduct
from its 1929 income any part of the losses resulting
from its investments in the subsidiaries.
The Revenue Act of 1928 and Regulations 75 made
under ยง 141 (b) govern. Section 141 (a) gives to groups
of affiliated corporations the privilege of making consolidated returns, in lieu of separate ones, for 1929 or in subsequent years upon condition that all members consent to
the regulations prescribed prior to the return. And, in
view of the many difficult problems arising in the administration of earlier provisions authorizing consolidated returns, the Congress deemed it desirable to delegate by
ยง 141 (b) the power "to prescribe regulations legislative
in character." Senate Report No. 960, 70th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 15. That subsection authorizes the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, to make such
regulations as he may deem necessary in order that the
tax liability of an affiliated group and of each member
"may be determined, computed, assessed, collected, and
adjusted in such manner as clearly to reflect the income
and to prevent avoidance of tax liability."
The making of the consolidated return constituted
acceptance by petitioner and its subsidiaries of the regulations that had been prescribed. No .question as to validity
is raised. The brief substance of the regulations here involved follows:
Article 37 (a) provides: Gains or losses shall not be
recognized upon a distribution during a consolidated return period by one member to another in cancellation or
redemption of its stock; "and any such distribution shall
be considered an intercompany transaction." And subdivision (b) requires that any such distribution after a

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U. S.

consolidated return period shall be treated as a sale, and
directs adjustments to be made in accordance with articles
34, 35 and 36.
Article 34 (ay prescribes the basis for determination of
gain or loss upon a sale by a member of stock issued by
another member and "during any part of the consolidated return period" held by the seller. Subdivision (c)
applies to sales which break affiliation and which are
made during the period that the selling corporation is a
member of the affiliated group.
Article 40 (a) directs that intercompany accounts receivable or other obligations which are the result of intercompany transactions during a consolidated return period
shall not "during a consolidated return period " be deducted as bad debts. Subdivision (c) governs deductions
after the consolidated return period on account of such
transactions during the period.
1. In the absence of a provision in the Act or regulations
that fairly may be read to authorize it, the deduction
claimed is not allowable. Brown v. Helvering, 291 U.S.
193, 199, 205. Burnet v. Houston, 283 U.S. 223, 227.
Cf. Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, 286 U.S. 319, 326. Petitioner contends that Articles 37 (b) and 34 (c) cover
the case. We are unable so to construe them. Article 37
relates to dissclutions. Subdivision (b) deals with distributions made after a consolidated return period. The
record conclusively shows that each subsidiary handed
over the balance before the dissolution was consummated
and during the consolidated return period. Article 34
relates exclusively to the sale of stock. No sale of stock
was involved. The parent and subsidiary corporations
were the only parties. Neither subsidiary acquired stock
of the other or that issued by itself. The petitioner retained all the shares of each and at the end voted dissolutions that operated to cancel them.

ILFELD CO. v. HERNANDEZ.
62

Opinion of the Court.

2. Respondent, relying on Articles 37 (a) and 40 (a),
maintains that the losses petitioner seeks to deduct arose
from intercompany transactions during the consolidated
return period and therefore may not be allowed.
Article 37 (a) forbids the recognition of losses upon distribution during the consolidated return period and declares that such distributions shall be considered intercompany transactions. Article 40 (a) forbids during that
period the deduction as bad debts of obligations which
are the result of intercompany transactions. The payment of the liquidating dividends was made during the
return period and was the last step leading up to the
action of directors and stockholders for the dissolution
of the subsidiaries. The amount handed over by the
Springer Company was less than petitioner's advances to
it, but the amount paid by the Roy Company was greater
than the advances to it. Undoubtedly the obligation of
the subsidiaries in respect of the advances would be held
to be intercompany accounts receivable quite independently of the regulations.
But a word is necessary as to the subsidiaries' obligations to the petitioner as stockholder. The record does
not disclose whether the latter obtained the stock directly
from the issuing corporations or purchased from others.
Without regard to the manner of acquisition, the amount
paid constituted investment in the subsidiaries. And, as
it was the owner of all the shares of the subsidiaries,
petitioner will be deemed to have directed all their
activities in the unitary business and as well the steps
taken for their liquidation and dissolution. They were
liable to it alone for the balances remaining after payment
of the amounts owed others, and it was equally entitled
whether claiming as lender or shareholder. Under the
circumstances, it reasonably may be held that their obligation in respect of petitioner's stock ownership resulted

292 U.S.

from intercompany transactions within the meaning of
Article 40 (a). Petitioner rightly says, as does respondent,
that the amounts paid for the stock and the advances later
made to the subsidiaries stand on the same footing. But
its contention that the transactions out of which the
claimed losses arose did not occur during the consolidated
return period cannot be sustained. Petitioner is therefore
not entitled to deduct them.from its 1929 income.
3. The allowance claimed would permit petitioner twice
to use the subsidiaries' losses for the reduction of its taxable income. By means of the consolidated returns in
earlier years it was enabled to deduct them. And now it
claims for 1929 deductions for diminution of assets resulting from the same losses. If allowed, this would be the
practical equivalent of double deduction. In the absence
of a provision of the Act definitely requiring it, a purpose so opposed to precedent and equality of treatment of
taxpayers will not be attributed to lawmakers. Cf. Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Co., 287 U.S. 544, 551. United
States v. Ludey, 274 U.S. 295, 301. There is nothing in
the Act that purports to authorize double deduction of
losses or in the regulations to suggest that the commissioner construed any of its provisions to empower him to
prescribe a regulation that would permit consolidated returns to be made on the basis now claimed by petitioner.
In R emington Rand, Inc. v. Commissioner, 33 F. (24)
77, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
held a subsidiary company's accumulated earnings on
stock sold to a parent company could not be added to the
cost of the stock in determining taxable gain arising on
the latter's sale to outsiders. In United Publishers' Corp.
v. Anderson, 42 F. (2d) 781, a district court in the same
circuit, deeming the Remington Rand case applicable, held
that a parent corporation filing consolidated returns showing losses of a subsidiary during earlier years could nevertheless deduct loss on the sale of the subsidiary's stock.

ELECTRIC CABLE. CO. v. EDISON CO.
62

Syllabus.

Petitioner insists that same principle governs both decisions and that therefore the deduction should be allowed.
But the analogy is not good. Where all the members gain,
total taxable income is the same on a consolidated return
as upon separate ones. But where as in the case before us
the subsidiaries lose and the parent gains, the losses of
the former go in reduction of the taxable income of the
latter. Considerations that justify inclusion of the profits
made by all the members do not support the double
deduction claimed.
The weight of authority is against petitioner's contention. Burnet v. Riggs Nat. Bank, 57 F. (2d) 980. Commissioner v. Apartment Corp., 67 F. (2d) 3. Summerfield
Co. v. Commissioner, 29 B.T.A. 77. National Casket Co.
v. Commissioner, 29 B.T.A. 139. No decision other than
that of the district court in United Publishers' Corp. v.
Anderson, supra, gives any support to its claim. Cf. Burnet v. Imperial Elevator Co., 66 F. (2d) 643. McLaughlin
v. Pacific Lumber Co., 66 F. (2d) 895.
