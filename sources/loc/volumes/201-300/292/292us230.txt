McKNETT v. ST. LOUIS & SAN FRANCISCO RAILWAY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA.

No. 597.

Argued March 12, 1934.--Decided April 30, 1934.

The Federal Constitution forbids that a State should clo~e its courts
to transitory causes of action against foreign corporations arising
in other States under federal law (Federal Employers' Liability
Act) while opening them to the litigation of all like transitory
causes arising in other States under state law. P. 232.

CERTIORARI,

damages.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This action was brought under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act, in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County,
Alabama, to recover damages for an injury suffered in
Tennessee. The plaintiff, McKnett, is a resident of Tennessee. The defendant, St. Louis & San Francisco Railway Company, is a foreign corporation doing business in
Alabama. It pleaded in abatement that the court lacked
jurisdiction, since the cause of action had arisen wholly

in Tennessee and did not arise by the common law or
statute of that State. The plea rested upon the limiting
words of the Act of 1907, now embodied in § 5681, Code
of 1923, which declares:
"Whenever, either by common law or the statutes of
another state, a cause of action, either upon contract or
in tort, has arisen in such other state against any person
or corporation, such cause of action shall be enforcible
in the courts of this state, in- any county in which jurisdiction of the defendant can be legally obtained in the
same manner in which jurisdiction could have been
obtained if the cause of action had arisen in this state."
A demurrer to the plea was overruled; and the judgment entered thereon for the defendant was affirmed by
the highest court of the State. 227 Ala. 349; 149 So. 822.
This Court granted certiorari.
The courts of Alabama have, at all times, taken jurisdiction of suits between natural persons on transitory
causes of action arising in another state, even if both of
the parties were non-residents of Alabama.' But prior to
the Act of 1907, it had been consistently held, under the
rule established by Central Railroad & Banking Co. v.
Carr, 76 Ala. 388, that no Alabama court had jurisdiction
of any suit against a foreign corporation unless the cause
of action had arisen within the State.2 In the case at
bar, the court held that, despite the 1907 Act, lack of

Apparently the rule was applied whether the plaintiff was a resident
or a non-resident. See Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Dooley, 78
Ala. 524; compare Iron Age Publishing Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 83 Ala. 498, 505-6; 3 So. 449.

jurisdiction still existed in respect to causes of action
arising in another state under the federal law; because,
since the statute was in plain terms limited to suits arising
under the law of the other state, it could not be extended
by construction to include causes of action arising in such
other state under a federal law.
The plaintiff contends that by refusing to entertain
jurisdiction, the state court has denied him a right expressly conferred by Congress and guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The defendant insists that the statute
as construed is consistent with the Federal Constitution;
since a state may determine the limits of the jurisdiction
of its courts, the character of the controversies which
shall be heard in them; Anglo-American Provision Co.
v. Davis Provision Co., No. 1, 191 U.S. 373; Chambers v.
Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 207 U.S. 142, 148-9; and the

trial of transitory causes of action arising in other states.

U.S. 377.
Alabama has granted to its circuit courts general jurisdiction of the class of actions to which that here brought
belongs, in cases between litigants situated like those in
the case at bar.3 The court would have had jurisdiction
of the cause between these parties if the accident had, occurred in Alabama. It would have had jurisdiction although the accident occurred in Tennessee, if the defendant had been a domestic corporation. It would have had
jurisdiction, although the defendant was a foreign corporation, the plaintiff a nonresident, and the accident

occurred in Tennessee, if the suit had been brought for an
injury suffered while engaged in intrastate commerce.
Thus, the ordinary jurisdiction of the Alabama circuit
court is appropriate to enforce the right against this defendant conferred upon the plaintiff by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. And its jurisdiction was invoked
according to the rules of procedure prevailing in that
court.
The power of a State to determine the limits of the
jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject
to the 'estrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.
The privileges and immunities clause requires a state to
*accord to citizens of other states substantially the same
right of access to its courts as it accords to its own citizens.
Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash.C.C. 371, 381. Compare
CanadianNorthern Ry. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U.S. 553. The
full faith and credit clause requires a state court to take
jurisdiction of an action to enforce a judgment recovered
in another state, although it might have refused to entertain a suit on the original cause of action as obnoxious to
its public policy. Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230;
Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 415; Loughran
v. Loughran, decided this day, ante, p. 216. By Mondou v.
New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 223 U.S. 1, an action in a
Connecticut court against a domestic corporation, it was
settled that a state court whose ordinary jurisdiction as
prescribed by local laws is appropriate for the occasion,
may not refuse to entertain suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
While Congress has not attempted to compel states to
provide courts for the enforcement of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Douglas. v. Itew York, N. H. &
H. R. Co., 279 U.S. 377, 387, the Federal Constitution prohibits state courts of general jurisdiction from refusing to
do so solely because the suit is brought under a federal

law. The denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is
based solely upon the source of law sought to be enforced. The plaintiff is cast out because he is suing to
enforce a federal act. A state may not discriminate
against rights arising under federal laws.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 783.

Argued April 4, 5, 1934.-Decided April 30, 1934.

1. A court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction by ancillary proceedings
to enforce an order of discharge by enjoining the prosecution of
suits brought against the debtor. P. 239.
2. Such a proceeding being ancillary and dependent, the jurisdiction
of the court follows that of the original cause, and may be maintained without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the
amount involved, and nothwithstanding the provisions of § 265 of
the Judicial Code; R.S., § 720; 28 U.S.C., § 379. P. 239.
3. Where the legal remedy of setting up a discharge as a defense in
an action involving the rights of the bankrupt under it, would
entail not only his intervention in a state court of first instiance,
but also, because of previous decisions of .the State Supreme Court,
a succession of appeals, causing dispimportionate trouble, embarrassment, expense and possible loss to the bankrupt, held that the
remedy was inadequate, and that the equitable jurisdiction of the
court of bankruptcy by way of an ancillary suit for injunction was
properly engaged. P. 241.
4. An assignment of future-earned wages to secure a loan, held not
a lien within the meaning of § 67 (d) of the Bankruptcy Act.
P. 242.
5. That such an assignment, even if a lien under the state law,
should survive the discharge of the debt in bankruptcy, would be
contrary to the policy of the Bankruptcy Act to free the debtor;
and so it must be held, where the suit is ancillary in the bankruptcy court to enforce the discharge, though the decisions of the
state court be to the contrary. P. 244.
67 F. (2d) 998, affirmed.
