struck some obstacle and he was brushed off and killed. Held:
(1) That the question whether- he was a "passenger" at the
time did not depend upon the meaning of that word in the terminology applied in negligence suits against common carriers. P. 83.
(2) The insured was a "passenger" within the meaning of the
policy, construing it liberally in his favor and giving its words
their common meaning. P. 85.
(3) The fact that the stipulation construed was one for double
indemnity was not a reason for construing it more strictly than
other provisions of the policy. P. 85.

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 622, to review a judgment directing that a recovery of double indemnity on a policy of
accident insurance be reduced one-half.
Mr. Randell Larson, with whom Mr. Allen G. Wright
was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. George A. Work, with whom Mr. Edwin C. Brandenburg was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner, a beneficiary of a policy of accident insurance issued to her husband by respondent, brought this
.suit in the District Court for Northern California to recover. under the double indemnity provisions of the policy.
At the trial liability was conceded for the single amount
stipulated to be paid in the event of the insured's, death
by accident, but doubl liability was contested on the
ground that the insured, at the time of the accident, was
not a passenger on a common carrier within the meaning
of the double indemnity provisions of the policy. A
judgment entered upon a verdict for the petitioner for
the double liability was reversed by the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, which directed that judgment be
reduced by one-half. 65 F. (2d) 976. Certiorari was

granted to resolve an alleged conflict of the decision below
with those in other circuits. See London Guarantee &
Accident Co. v. Ladd; PreferredAccident Ins. Co. v. Ladd,
299 Fed. 562, 565 (C.C.A. 6th); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.
Davis, 191 Fed. 343 (C.C.A. 8th-) ; PreferredAccident Ins.
Co. v. Muir, 126 Fed. 926 (C.C.A. 3d); compare Fidelity
& Casualty Co. v. Morrison, 129 Ill. App. 360.
The policy provided for payment of a specified amount
in case of loss of life of the insured resulting from accidental bodily injury and for payment of double that
amount "if such injury is sustained by the insured (1)
while a passenger in or on a public conveyance (including the platform, steps or running board thereof) provided by a common carrier for passenger service." The
insured, who had in his possession a ticket entitling him
to transportation, arrived at the railroad station platform
just as the train started to move out of the station. There
was testimony from which the jury might have found that,
while the train was moving at a speed of seven to ten
miles an hour but was still within the station and opposite
the platform, with vestibule doors open, the insured
jumped onto the lower step of a car, his hand grasping the
handrail, and that he continued for a brief time, while the
train moved about twenty -feet, to stand with both feet
upon the step but with a small part of his body or clothing
projecting beyond or outside the vestibule until it brushed
against a bystander on the platform in a manner causing
the imured to lose his hold and fall to his death.
The trial judge instructed the jury that if the insured
held a ticket entitling him to .ride as a passenger, and in
attempting to board the train while in motion he stood
with both feet upon the step, he was a passenger and
entitled to recover under the double indemnity clause.
The only question which it is necessary to decide here is
whether the insured was a " passenger" at the time of the
accident within the meaning of the policy. The Court of

ASCHENBRENNER v. U. S. F. & G. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Appeals ruled that he was not; it reached this conclusion
by applying the term as it was said to be defined in the
law of common carriers.
In personal injury suits against common carriers,
brought by persons who, intending to be passengers, were
injured while endeavoring to mount the steps of a mov-"
ing train, courts have sometimes said that the implied
invitation to board the train is withdrawn when it begins
to move and that the duty of the carrier to exercise a
high degree of care toward its passengers does not attach
in such circumstances because one seeking to board a
moving train does not become a passenger until he reaches
a place of safety. Trapnell v. Hines, 268 Fed. 504, 506;
Illinois Central R. Co. v. Cotter, 31 Ky. Law Rep. 679;
103 S.W. 279; Kentucky Highlands R. Co. v. Creal, 166
Ky. 469; 179 S.W. 417; Mathews v. Metropolitan Street
Ry. Co., 156 Mo. App. 715; 137 S.W. 1003; Schepers v.
Union Depot R. Co., 126 Mo. 665, 675; 29 S.W. 712;
Tompkins v. PortlandRy. Co., 77 Ore. 174, 179; 150 Pac.
758; Palmer v. Willamette Valley Southern Ry. Co., 88
Ore. 322, 330; 171 Pac. 1169. The Court of Appeals
thought that the evidence here would have made no case
for the jury in a suit against the carrier, and therefore
concluded that the trial judge should have directed a
verdict for the insurer on the issue of double indemnity.
No doubt intending passengers who are injured in attempting to board a moving train, unless they were invited
to do so, are not usually entitled to recover from the
carrier. But it is not clear that such cases turn on the
existence or non-existence of the passenger-carrier relationship. See Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Holloway,
71 Kan. 1; 80 Pac. 31. It has often been recognized that
the relationship of carrier and passenger may arise and
the duty of the carrier to the passenger attach when the
latter comes upon the station platform and before boarding the train. See Warner v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,

supra; Wabash, St. L. & P. R. Co. v. Rector, 104 Ill. 296;
Chicago & E. I. R. Co. v. Jennings, 190 Ill. 478, 483;
60 N.E. 818; Michie, Carriers (1915), §§ 2126, et seq.
Yet the negligence of a passenger in going into a known
place of danger without the inducement or invitation of
the carrier may bar his recovery for the resulting injury,
even though the passenger-carrier relationship has begun
and continues. See Warner v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,
supra; Daley v. Boston, R. B. & L. R. Co., 241 Mass. 78;
134 N.E. 376. And in the case of the insured, who had
come upon the station platform intending to be a passenger, it may be that negligence in jumping uninvited onto
the moving train would bar his recovery from the carrier
without resort to the artificial assumption of a hiatus in
that relationship during the brief interval required for
boarding the train. The notion of such a suspension of
the passenger-carrier relationship has been rejected in
allowing recovery upon policies insuring against injur"
while travelling as a" passenger" on a railway train, both
where the passenger alighted from the train at an intermediate stop and was injured in attempting to return to
the train after it started to move again, Wharton v. New
York Life Ins. Co., 178 N.C. 135, 138; 100 S.E. 266, and
where the insured, in beginning his journey, was injured
in attempting to board a moving train. Fidelity &
Casualty Co. v. Morrison, 129 Ill. App. 360.
But it is unnecessary here to follow the niceties of legal
reasoning and terminology applied in negligence suits
against common carriers, for we are interpreting a contract and are concerned only with the sense in which its
words were used. Farber v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 250
Mass. 250, 254; 145 N.E. 535; Boyd v. Royal Indemnity
Co., 120 Oh. St. 515, 517; 166 N.E. 580. The phraseology
of contracts of insurance is that chosen by the insurer and
the contract in fixed form is tendered to the prospective
policy holder who is often without technical training, and

who rarely accepts it with a lawyer at his elbow. So if
its language is reasonably open to two constructions, that
more favorable to the insured will be adopted, tipcich v.
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 277 U.S. 311, 322; Mutual
Life Ins. Co. v. Hurni Packing Co., 263 U.S. 167, 174;
and unless it is obvious that the words are intended to be
used in their technical connotation they will be given the
meaning that common speech imports. Neighbors.v. Life
& Casualty Ins. Co., 182 Ark. 356; 31 S.W. (2d) 418;
Tupper v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 156 Minn.
65; 194 N.W. 99; Anderson v. Fidelity & Casualty Co.,
228 N.Y. 475, 483; 127 N.E. 584.
We think the word "passenger" can not be restricted to
the technical meaning which may be assigned to it by the
law of common carriers, for it also has a common or popular meaning which would at least include the insured
who, with a ticket in his possession, was riding on the
steps of the train. In its usual popular significance the
term, when applied to one riding a train, indicates a traveller, intending to be transported for hire or upon contract
with the carrier, and. distinguishes him from those employed to render service in connection with the journey.
See Wood v. General Accident Ins. Co., 160 Fed: 926;
Travelers Ins. Co. v. Austin, 116 Ga. 264; 42 S.E. 522;
Ward v. North American Accident Ins. Co., 182 Ill. App.
317; compare Continental Life Ins. Co. v. Newman, 219
Ala. 311; 123 So. 93; U.S. Casualty Co. v. Ellison, 65 Colo.
252; 176 Pac. 279. None of the standard dictionaries defines the term in a fashion suggesting that its meaning is
to be limited in terms of the legal liability of the carrier.
While for the purposes of judicial decision dictionary definitions often are not controlling, they are at least persuasive that meanings which they do not embrace are not
common.
That the stipulation to be construed is one for double
indemnity calls for no different conclusion. It has been

argued that such a provision contemplates a risk which
is comparatively slight and that therefore it should be
strictly construed. It may be that the insurer assumes
little additional risk; but the terms of the clause disclose
an inducement to insure set forth in attractive detail.'
The policy contains no exceptions exempting the insurer
from liability if the injury is caused by negligence of the
insured, or restricting the liability to accidents occurring
only after a point of safety has been reached, and the
steps of a car are specifically included in the place where
injury insured against may occur. Nothing in the policy
gives any hint that words in this clause are used more
narrowly than those in any other. The insurer has chosen
the terms, and it must be held to their full measure in
this clause, as in any other, whether its promise be for
more or less. London Guarantee & Accident Co. v. Ladd,
