SlUabus.

Here the shipowner recognized the judgment; said
nothing against its validity. The proceedings in the two
courts looked towards entirely different ends.
The established rule in this Court is that if, in a second
action between the same parties, a claim or demand different from the one sued upon in the prior action is
presented, then the judgment in the former cause is an
estoppel "only as to those matters in issue or points
controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered." Bates v. Bodie, 245 U.S.
520, 526; United States v. Moser, 266 U.S. 236, 241;
United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S.
451, 458. "While a defendant must bring forward all
purely defensive matter, he is not barred by a former
judgment against him as to any matter which he was not
bound to present and which was not in fact litigated.
A judgment is not conclusive of those matters as to which
a party had the option to but did not in fact put in litigation in the action." Freeman on Judgments. 5th ed.,

etc., or commenced against any person for or on account of anything done by him while an officer of either House of Congress in
the discharge of his official duty in executing any order of such
House, was amended in 1916 to include any civil or criminal action
against "any officer of the courts of the United States for or on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance
of his duties as such officer."-Held:
That the amendment does not embrace an action against the
receiver of a railroad appointed by a federal court, where the purpose of the action is merely to recover damages for personal
injuries resulting from negligence of the defendant's 'employees in
operating a train. Barnette v. Wells Fargo Bank, 270 U.S. 438,

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Ruff brought in a state court of Georgia this suit against

of plaintiff's minor son as a result of the negligent operation of a train by employees of the receiver. Before trial
Sin the state court, the receiver duly filed in the appropriate federal court a petition for removal and certiorari,
under the amendment made by Act of August 23, 1916,
c. 399, 39 Stat. 532 to Judicial Code § 33, which inserted
therein the clause:
"or against any officer of the courts of the United States

final judgment for want of prosecution. The Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that judgment, with direction to set aside the dismissal and remand
the cause to the state court. 67 F. (2d) 684. Because of
conflict of decisions,' certiorari was granted to determine
whether the amendment to Judicial Code § 33 authorizes
a receiver of a railroad appointed by a federal, court sitting
in equity to remove from a state court an action brought
against him as receiver for damages resulting from the
negligent operation of a train by his employees.
First. The respondent raises the preliminary question
whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the action
of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The contention is that
this Court lacks jurisdiction to review a judgment directing
the remand to a state court, because Judicial Code § 28.
declares:
"Whenever any cause shall be removed from any State
court into any district court of the United States, and the
district court shall decide that the cause- was improperly
removed, and order the same to be remanded to the State
court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of
error from the decision of the district court so remanding
such cause shall be allowed: . . .!

Opinion of the Court.

This provision, enacted in 1887, was broadly construed
by this Court as prohibiting review of an order of remand,
directly or indirectly, by any proceeding. The prohibition
was applied to appeals from, and writs of error to, the
federal circuit [and later district] court; to writs of error
to a state court after final judgment there; and to mandsinus in this Court.4 In German National Bank v.
Speckert, 181 U.S. 405, 409, where the trial court had refused to remand the case to the state court and the Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that judgment and
ordered a remand, this Court held that it was without
jurisdiction to review the latter's action. While adverting
in support of its conclusion to the broad construction
which had been given to the above-quoted prohibition.

the Court ruled there that the fact that an order of remand is not a final judgment precluded its review by writ
of error.5
1875, express provision was made to review the remand by appeal or
writ of error. That provision was repealed by Act of March 3, 1S87,
c. 373, § 2, 24 Stat. 552, 553 (corrected by Act of August 13, 1888,
c.866, § 2, 25 Stat. 433, 435), which enacted the provision embodied
in Judicial Code § 28.

U.S. 417. Compare Pickiwick-Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Shattuck,
61 F. (2d) 485.
"The contention made that the prohibition in § 28 does not extend
to cases under § 33, because of the saving clause in § 5 of the Acts of
1887 and 188S, appears to be unfounded. See Cole v. Garland, 107
Fed. 759; dismissed on appeal, 183 U.S. .693. Compare Kentucky %-.
Powers, 139 Fed. 452. Moreover, the saving clause of § 5 of the
Acts of 1887 and 1888 was in terms applicable to Revised Statutes
§§ 641, 642, 643; and those sections were repealed expressly by the
Judicial Code. Their substance was carried into §§ 31, 32, 33,
respectively, of the Judicial Code; but § 5, though not expressly
repealed, was nowhere carried into the Judicial Code. See, also,
Index of Federal Statutes (1934), p. 1297, Footnote 44, which states

But by reason of the extensive power to issue writs of
certiorari which the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891 6
thereafter gave to this Court, it may now review the
action of the circuit court of appeals in directing the remand of a cause to the state court. That Act provided
that in any case in which the judgment of the circuit
court of appeals is made final, "it shall be competent
for the Supreme Court to require, by certiorari or otherwise, any such case to be certified to the Supreme Court
for its review and deteimination with the same power and
authority in the case as if it had been carried by appeal
or writ of error to the Supreme Court." In Forsyth v.
Hammond, 166 U.S. 506, 512, it was held that the power
given was unaffected by the condition of the case as it
exists in the circuit court of appeals; that the power may
be exercised before, as well as after, any decision by that
court and irrespective of any ruling or determination
therein; and that the sole essential of this Court's jurisdiction to review is that there be a case pending in the
circuit court of appeals. The jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders was exercised in American Construction
Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. Ry. Co., 148 U.S. 372;
Denver v. New York Trust Co., 229 U.S. 123, 133; Spiller
v. Atchison, T. &S. F. Ry. Co., 253 U.S. 117, 121; and
Du Pont Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 U.S. 100. And in
The Three Friends, 166 U.S. 1, 49, it was held that this
Court could review a case pending in, and not yet decided by, the circuit court of appeals, with the same power
and authority as if it had been carried here by appeal or
writ of error "that is, as if it had been brought directly
from the District or Circuit Court." In Chicago, B. &
Q- Ry. Co. v. Willard, 220 U.S. 413, decided under the
that by reason of the express repeal of §§ 1-4, 6, 7, of the Act of 1887
by the Judicial Code, "Sec. 5 can have no force independent of the
remainder of the act."

GAY v. RUFF.
25

Opinion of the Court.

Act of 1891, this Court, without questioning its power, reviewed the judgment of the circuit court of appeals reversing a judgment of dismissal and ordering a remand.
Nor has the existence of the power been questioned by
the Court since.'
Second. The contention that the removal is authorized
rests upon the amendment made by the Act of 1916 to
Judicial Code § 33. The argument for removal is that,
since the receiver is an "officer" of the federal court and
an action for damages resulting from the negligent operation. of a train by his employees is a suit "for or on
account of" an "act done in the performance of his duties
as such officer," the removal here in question is directed in
such plain words that there is no room for any other construction of the statute. But the amendment may not be
isolated from its context. It must be read in the light of
the then existing provisions of § 33; of the then existing
statute conferring the right to bring in a state court suits
against receivers; of the statute denying removal from
state to federal courts of a large class of cases similar in
character to that before us; and of other legislation restricting the jurisdiction of federal trial courts. When the
clause is so read, there arises at least a doubt whether
Congress intended to give to the words inserted in § 33 the
comprehensive meaning attributed to them. That doubt
makes it appropriate to examine the history of the amendment, Binns v. 'United States, 194 U.S. 486, 495; United
States v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry., 247 U.S. 310, 318. And
such examination makes it clear that Congress did not
authorize the removal of this case.
'The Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, § 1, 43 Stat. 938, amending
§ 240 (a) of the Judicial Code, gives in terms the power to review
by Writ of certiorari "either before or after a judgment or decree"
of the lower court, "with the same power and authority and with
like effect, as if the cause had been brought there by unrestricted
writ of error or appeal."

Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

.Judicial Code § 33 enables a defendant in a state court
to remove the case before trial of final hearing there, and
thus secure an adjudication by a federal court of first instance oi the issues of fact as well as law involved in his
justification under the federal statutes. Tcnncssce v.
Davis, 100 U.S. 257, 263: The origin of that section is
§ 3 of the " Force Act," March 2. 1833, c. 57, 4 Stat. (632,
(i33-thc nation's reply to 'outh Carolina's threat of
" nullification." The purpose of the Force Act was to
prevent paralysis of operations of the federal government.
The special aim of § 3 was to protect those engagcd in the
elfioicement of the federal revenue law from attack by
mnCas of prosecutionls and suits in a state Court for violation of state law. This removal provision was extended
by Act of March 3, 1875, c. 130, § 8, 1S Stat. 371. 401, to
,uits against any person for or on account of anything
done by him while an officer of either 11ouse of Cong'ess
in the discharge of his official duty in executing any order
of such 1h0LSC." These provisions only are embodied in
Judicial Code § 33. The scope of the section was thus
There had been several other acts amending § 3 of the Force Act
and § 643 of the Revised Statutes which embodied it. While § 3 of
the Act of 1833 provided in terms for removal where the suit is
against 'any oflicer of the United States, or other person, for or on
account of any act done under the revenue laws of tile United State,
or under color thereof," the title of the Act referred only to collection
of duties on imports. Doubtless for this reason, it was deemed
desirable in the Internal Revenue Act of June 30, 1S64, c. 173, § 50,
13 Stat. 241, to extend the operation of the 183.3 Act in terms to
intcrnal rcvcnte ollicers and those acting under the internal revenue
laws. Compare Hothal v. Collector, 9 Wall. 560, 561. By Act of
July 13, 1860, c. 1S4, § 6S, 14 Stat. 9S, 171, that provision was
repealed; and by § 67 of the same Act this removal provision was
made available to any officer acting under the internal revenue laws
or " againiit any perscn acting under or by authority of such officer."
By Act of February 28, 1871, c. 99, § 16, 16 Stat. 433, 438, the provision was extended to those engaged in enforcing laws for the
protection of the clective framchise. In Revised Statutes § 643 this

limited to cases arising out-of the enforcement of the revenue laws or of some order of either House of Congress.
And it applied in those cases only when the person defending caused it to appear that his defense was that in doing
the acts charged he was doing no more than his duty
0
under those laws or orders.
To appreciate the exceptional character of the removal
privilege conferred by § 33, that section should be compared with § 28. Of the two, § 33 alone provides for
removal of a crimiial case. Removal of civil causes is
provided for in both § 33 and § 28 of the Judicial Code.
But the civil cases to which § 33 is applicable are few,
while § 28 applies to many. Under the latter, any officer
of a federal court can remove a suit brought against him
on account of any act done under color of his office or
in the performance of his duties as such officer, because
§ 28 applies to "any suit of a civil nature, at law or in
equity, arising under the Consfitution or laws of the
United States, . ...of which the district courts of the
United States are given original jurisdiction." But in
order to avail of the removal privilege conferred by § 28
in respect of a suit arising under the Constitution or laws
of the United States, the facts showing that the suit is of
provision appears; but by Act of February 8, 1894, c. 25, 28 Stat. 36,
most of Title XXVI of the Revised Statutes relating to elective
franchises was repealed and with it that part of § 643 relating to the
elective franchise.
It was held in Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), 270 U.S. 9, that by the
National Prohibition Act, October 28, 1919, c. 85, Title II, § 28, 41
Stat. 316, this removal provision was extended to prohibition officers
or agents engaged in the enforcement of that act. See also Colorado

that class must appear by the complaint in the state
court;' 0 the amount in controversy must exceed $3000,
except in those cases where jurisdiction is conferred regardless of amount; 11 the petition for removal must be
filed in the state court before the time fixed for answer
there; and it must be accompanied by a bond. On the
other hand, where § 33 is applicable, the conditions for
removal are much more liberal. Removal may be had
of the civil suit, at any time before trial or final hearing "
in the state court, regardless of the amount involved and
without giving any bond, by filing the appropriate papers
in the federal court. 1 And the facts showing that the
suit is of a removable class need not appear by the complaint in the state court.
Third. The case here sought to .be removed has none
of the characteristics of those which were removable
under Judicial Code § 33 before the 1916 amendment.
This suit is under the law of Georgia; and was brought as
of right in the state court. Erb v. Morasch, 177 U.S.
584. It does not relate to any operation of the federal
government. The defendant receiver does not justify
under any judgment or order of a federal court. Nor
does the suit present otherwise any federal question. Its
only relation to the federal law is that the receiver sued
was appointed by a federal court, in the exercise of its
diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. The fact that the
defendant is a federal receiver does not make the cause
removable "upon the ground that it was a case arising
under the Constitution and laws of the United States."

Opinion of the Court.

If the amendment of 1916 is construed as merely affording the protection of removal to officers of the court engaged in executing its judgments or orders, it is strictly
in pari materia with the other removal provisions of § 33.
If it is construed so as to authorize removal of the case at
bar, it introduces a wholly different ground of jurisdiction; in effect, repeals by implication legislation which
deals expressly with suits against receivers; and departs
from the established trend of legislation limiting the jurisdiction of the federal trial courts.
I. Congress provided in 1887 that the fact that the defendant was a federal receiver should not preclude the
14
maintenance of an action against him in a state court.
That provision had recently been embodied in § 66 of the
Judicial Code which declares:
"Every receiver or manager of any property appointed
by any court of the United States may be sued in respect
of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business
connected with such property, without the previous leave
of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed; . .
In the thirty-nine years since its enactment there had
not been, so far as appears, any attempt to repeal that
law. It is in harmony with the trend of legislation providing that. the federal character of the litigant should not
alone confer jurisdiction upon a federal court-a policy
acted upon in case of national banks as early as 1882 1'5
and which had been extended in 1915 to railroads having
federal charters."6

II. Congress had by the Federal Employers' Liability
Act " provided that suits for injuries resulting from negligence in the operation of a railroad, although arising
under a federal statute, could be brought in a state court,
and if so brought, could not be removed to the federal
court.
III. Congress had by recent legislation manifested its
adherence to the policy, inaugurated in 1887, of restricting the jurisdiction of the federal trial court. Thus, the
prescribed jurisdictional amount, which, after standing for
nearly a century at $500 had been raised to $2,000 in
1887,18 and was increased to $3,000 in 1911.1" Moreover,

provision might have been desired so as to make it apply
to those engaged in executing any judgment or order of
a federal court. For any order of the court might arouse
opposition to those engaged in enforcing it and result in
retaliation by means of proceedings instituted in a state
court. The only method of securing in such other cases
an adjudication in the federal court before trial in the
state court was then by habeas corpus; and that remedy
was not always adequate.2 8
The report of the Judiciary Committee 6f the House
which recommended the adoption of the 1916 amendment
establishes that such was the sole purpose of Congress.
It states: 2 '
"The purpose of the proposed amendment is to extend
the provisions of section 33 uniformly to officers of the
courts of the United States, not only in cases arising under
the revenue laws, but in all cases, giving to them the same
protection in all cases now given to officers acting under
the revenue laws, and to officers of Congress. The omission of such a provision from the original act gives rise
to certain incongruities and creates a want of uniformity
in the application of the law; for example: a United States
"Among other reasons, because the relief on habeas corpus is to
some extent discretionary. Since the officer if successful upon habeas
corpus may be released unconditionally without a jury trial, the federal court may be unwilling to give relief unless the justification is
clear upon the prelim-nary showing. Compare United States v.
Lewis, 200 U.S. 1; Whitten v. Tomlinson, 160 U.S. 231, 240; In re
Miller, 42 Fed. 307; Walker v. Lea, 47 Fed. 645; In re Marsh, 51
Fed. 277; In re Matthews, 122 Fed. 248.
"H.R. No. 776, 64th Cong., 1st Session. The rest of the report is
devoted to an elaboration of these propositions. As indicating a lack
of intention to extend broadly the right of removal in civil suits
against an officer of the court, it states: "In a civil suit against a
Federal marshal on account of acts done by him as such marshal,
such suit is now removable to the federal courts though no revenue
law is involved (Bock v. Perkins, 139 U.S. 628 (1891) and Wood v.
Drake, 70 Fed. 881 (1895))."

Opinion of the Court.

marshal engaged in the execution of a warrant or other
process of the United States court, in a case which involves
the prosecution of a violation of the revenue laws, is
entitled to the right of removal, now conferred by this
statute. Davis v." South' Carolina, 107 U.S. 597 (1882).
The same marshal engaged in executing process of the
same court in whichr the revenue law is not involved is
not, entitled to the right of removal. This creates an
anomalous condition which cannot be justified upon any
line .of reasoning.
"The statute, with the proposed amendment, does not
extend in any degree the jurisdiction or the powers of the
courts of the United States. It merely provides a more
orderly method of procedure, which enures as much, in fact
more, to the benefit of the States than to the benefit of the
United States, because it substitutes for the writ of
habeas corpus the right of removal, so that instead of a
summary discharge under the habeas corpus ptoceedings
the amendment provides for trial before a court and

jury."

The action of th6 Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing
the judgment of the District Court and directing that the
cause be remanded to the state court wa proper. A suit
for damages for an injuryresulting from negligent operation of a train is not, within the meaning of Judicial Code
§ 33 as amended, a suit "for or on account of any act done
under color of his [the receiver's] office." The receiver
here sued, although an officer of the court operating the
railroad pursuant to the order appointing him, is not an
officer engaged in enforcing an order of a court. The operation of trains through his employees is a duty imposed
upon the receiver; but he is not entrusted in his capacity
as receiver with the service or execution of any process
of the court. Nor is there reason to assume that he will
in this case rest his defense on his duty to cause the train
to be operated.

Syllabus.

292 U.S.

In Barnette v. Wells FargoBank, 270 U.S. 438, 441, the

record does not disclose on what ground removal was
sought and allowed in the District Court or the jurisdiction was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Enough appears, however, to show that the case was
wholly unlike that now before us.

A. MAGNANO CO. v. HAMILTON, ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF WASHINGTON,

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 589.

Argued March 7, 1934.C-Decided April 2, 1934.

A statute of the State of Washington lays a tax of fifteen cents per
pound on all butter substitutes, including oleomargarine, sold
within the State. Held:
1. In respect of the equal protection clause it is obvious that
the differences between butter and oleomargarine are sufficient to
justify their separate classification for purposes of taxation. P. 43.
2. The requirement that a tax shall be for a public purpose has
regard to the use to be made of the revenue derived from the tax.
Its purpose may be public, although the motive behind it may have
been to benefit one industry (dairying) by burdening another
(oleomargarine). P. 43.
3. The statute in question imposes no burden on interstate
commerce. P. 43.
4. The effect on an individual of an interference with federal
taxing power, caused by destruction of a potential source of federal
taxes through excessive state taxation, is too speculative, indirect
and remote to afford the individual any equitable standing in a
suit to enjoin the state tax on the ground of such interference.
P. 43.
5. In general, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, applied to the States, like the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment, applied to Congress, is not a limitation upon
the taxing power. P. 44.
6. The due process clause applies if the Act be so arbitrary as
to compel the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of
