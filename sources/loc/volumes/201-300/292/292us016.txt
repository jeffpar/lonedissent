v. INTER-

STATE NATURAL GAS CO.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI.

No. 651.

Argued March 15, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.

1. A contract of tax exemption is not impaired by a later statute
authorizing assessments of back taxes on taxable property and not
specifying the property in question. P. 18.
2. A mere assessment for taxation is not a statute or an order of an
administrative board or commission within the meaning of § 266,
Judicial Code. P. 18.
3. A decree rendered by a District Court erroneously constituted of
three judges in a case not covered by § 266, Jud. Code, is not
reviewable on the merits by direct appeal to this Court; but such
appeal having been taken, this Court has jurisdiction to enforce
the limitations of that section; and, the time for appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals having expired,' this Court will reverse
the decree and remand to the District Court for. further proceedings to be taken independently of § 266. P. 19.
4 F.Supp. 697, reversed.
APPEAL

by the State Tax Collector and State Tax Com-

mission of Mississippi from a final decree of the District
Court, constituted of three judges. The decree made permanent a preliminary injunction enjoining the appellants
from making assessments of taxes.
Mr. Edward W. Smith, with whom Mr. Greek L. Rice,
Attorney General of Mississippi, and Mr. J. A. Lauderdale, Assistant Attorney General. were on the brief, for
the Tax Collector, appellant.

GULLY v. INTERSTATE NAT. GAS CO.
16

Per Curiam.

Mr. Weaver E. Gore filed a brief on behalf of the Tax
Commission of Mississippi, appellant.
Messrs. David Clay Bramlette and Garner W. Green,
with whom Messrs. William A. Dougherty, Marcellus
Green, Walter P. Armstrong, and Thomas A. McEachern
were on the brief, for appellee.
PER CURIAM.

Appellee brought this suit in the District Court of the
United States for the Southern District of Mississippi
seeking to enjoin state officers from proceedings to assess
its property for the years 1927 to 1931, inclusive, upon the
ground that the proposed assessments would impair the
obligation of a contract by which the C6mpany had secured an exemption from taxation. Chapter 138, Laws
of Mississippi of 1922, and Chapter 172, Laws of 1926.
The challenged proceedings were taken pursuant to a
statute which authorized assessments in cases where it was
ascertained that in past years property had escaped taxation. See Chapter 214, Laws of 1928; Chapler 291, Laws
of 1932; Mississippi Code of 1930, §§ 3226 and 6992;
Code Supp., 1933, §§ 3204, 3208. It appeared that on
April 14, 1933, at the instance of the State Tax Collector,
the State Tax Commission had made assessments of appellee's property for prior years, subject, however, to
objections to be made and filed with the Commission on
or before May 23, 1933. Appellee, instead of availing itself of that opportunity, filed its bill in this suit on May
16, 1933.
The District Judge, on an application for an interlocutory injunction, considering § 266 of the Judicial Code to
be applicable, called to his assistance 'two other judges;
and the District Court, as thus composed, granted an injunction restraining defendants from approving and
enforcing the proposed assessments. Motions to dismiss

the bill for want of equity were denied. An agreed statement of facts was filed and on final hearing the District
Court of three judges made the injunction permanent.
The court stated in its findings that it had been agreed
that the assessment order would certainly be made final.
No substantial question was presented as to the validity
of the statute authorizing assessments of property which
had escaped taxation. The statute did not specify the
property of appellee and it authorized assessments only
of property that was taxable.
A mere assessment is not a statute or an order of an
administrative board or commission within the meaning
of § 266 of the Judicial Code. Ex parte Williams, 277 U.S.
267, 272. The decision in City Bank Farmers'-Trust Co.
v. Schnader, 291 U.S. 24, is not to the contrary. Hence,
there was no occasion for constituting a court of three
judges. As the case was not one within § 266, the merits
cannot be brought to this Court by a direct appeal. Compare Smith v. Wilson, 273 U.S. 388, 389, 391; Healy v.
Ratta, 289 U.S. 701. But, although the merits cannot be
reviewed here in such a case, this Court by virtue of its
appellate jurisdiction in cases of decrees purporting to be
entered pursuant to § 266, necessarily has jurisdiction to
determine whether the court below has acted within the
authority conferred by that section and to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of
the limitations which that section imposes. The case is
analogous to those in which this Court, finding that the
court below has acted without jurisdiction, exercises its
appellate Jurisdiction to correct the improper action. Assessors v. Osborne, 9 Wall. 567, 575; Mansfield, C. & L.

& Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 280 U.S. 469, 477,

Per Curiam.

In this instance, relief cannot be afforded by treating
the decree of the District Court as appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals, notwithstanding the participation
of three judges (cf. Healy v. Ratta, 67 F. (2d) 554, 556),
as the time for appeal to that Court has expired. In these
circumstances, without passing upon the merits, the 'appropriate action is to reverse the decree below and to remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings to be taken independently of § 266 of the Judicial
Code.
Reversed.
