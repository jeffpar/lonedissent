FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 855. Argued May 7, 1934.-Decided June 4, 1934.

1. Policies of yearly renewable term insurance issued under the War
Risk Insurance Act, are not gratuities but are contracts of the
United States. P. 576.
2. Such valid contracts of the United States are property, and the
rights of private individuals arising out of them are protected by

the Fifth Amendment. P. 579.
3. Congress is without power to reduce expenditures by repudiating
and abrogating the contractual obligations of the United States.
P. 580.
4. Consent to sue the United States, on a contract is not a part of
the obligation of the contract which may not be impaired; it is a
privilege accorded, not the grant of a property right protected by
the Fifth Amendment, and may be withdrawn at any time. P. 580.

LYNCH v. UNITED STATES.
571

Argument for the United States.

Jurisdiction was refused below because of §§ 5 and 17
of the Economy Act of March 20, 1933.
Section 5 does not concern war risk insurance, and § 17
is the controlling section. By that section " all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are
hereby repealed," with certain saving provisos which do
not include this case. The repeal includes the section
under which suits on such policies have hitherto been
brought in District Courts (World War Veterans' Act,
1924, § 19, as amended by Act of July 3, 1930, c. 839, 46
Stat. 991, 992) and under which this suit was brought.
The repeal preceded the filing of the present suit. The
situation, therefore, is that at the time the present suit
was filed the only law under which jurisdiction Of it was
conferred upon the court had already been repealed. The
court, therefore, held correctly that it had no jurisdiction.
It is clear, and not seriously disputed, that this is the
meaning of the Act of 1933. That it was also the purpose
of Congress is made clear by the legislative history. The
question, therefore, is the power of Congress to withdraw
the jurisdiction previously given, and to terminate, before
the suit was brought, the consent of the United States to
be sued in such a case.
Petitioner complains that the Act of 1933 has wholly
confiscated his rights under an insurance contract by repealing all the laws that grant them; but by the same
Act of which he complains, the courts were deprived of
all jurisdiction to entertain his, complaint. If such withdrawal of jurisdiction is valid, the alleged effect of the
Economy Act upon petitioner's asserted contract rights
can not be considered. United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S.
328; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 13; Hill v. United
Stat s, 149 U.S. 593; Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529;
De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 432.
There is no difference, we submit, between an asserted
violation of the Fifth Amendment involving a con-

tractual obligation and one which does not; nor does a
different situation arise where the right to sue is withdrawn from that which arises when it has never been
conferred.
Of course, where a, right has vested in an individual to
sue one other than the United States, Congress may be
without power to remove that right. Its absolute power
to take away a right to sue applies only where the suit
is against the Government. This power is inherent in
the status of the Government as a sovereign. United
States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 206; Bryson v. Hines, 268 Fed.
290.
In short, whatever power Congress may have had over
the petitioner's contract, directly, it clearly had the power
to close the courts. Having done that before the suit was
brought, it follows that the District Court had no jurisdiction of the case, and both courts below have properly
so held.
The present suit is not shown to have been filed in
time.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases, which are here on certiorari, present for
decision the same question. In each, the plaintiff is the
beneficiary under a policy for yearly renewable term
insurance' issued during the World War pursuant to the
War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105,
Section 404 provides: "That during the period of war and thereafter until converted the insurance shall be term insurance for successive terms of one year each. Not later than five years after the
date of the termination of the war as declared by proclamation of
the President of the United States, the term insurance shall be converted, without medical examination, into such form or forms of
insurance as may be prescribed by regulations and as the insured
may request. Regulations shall provide for the right to convert
into ordinary life, twenty payment life, endowment maturing at age
sixty-two, and into other usual forms of insurance...."

LYNCH v. UNITED STATES.
571

Opinion of the Court.

Article IV, §§ 400-405. The actions were brought in
April, 1933, in federal district courts to recover amounts
alleged to be due. In each case it is alleged that the
insured had, before September 1, 1919 and while the
policy was in force, been totally and permanently disabled; that he was entitled to compensation sufficient to
pay the premiums on the policy until it matured by
death; that no compensation had ever been paid; that
the claim for payment was presented by the beneficiary
after the death of the insured; that payment was refused; and that thereby the disagreement arose which
the law makes a condition precedent to the right to bring
suit. In No. 855, which comes here from the Fifth Circuit, the insured died November 27, 1924. In No. 861,
which comes here from the Seventh Circuit, the insured
died May 15, 1929.
In each case, the United States demurred to the petition on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, because the consent of the
United States to be sued had been withdrawn by the Act
of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 9, commonly called the
Economy Act.
The plaintiffs duly claimed that the Act deprived them
of property without due process of law in violation of the
Fifth Amendment. The district courts overruled the
objection; sustained the demurrers and dismissed the complaints. Their judgments were affirmed by the circuit
courts of appeals. 67 F. (2d) 490; 68 id. 442. The only
question requiring serious consideration relates to the
construction and effect to be given to the clause of § 17
of the Economy Act upon which the Government relies;
for the character and incidents of War Risk Insurance
and the applicable rules of constitutional law have been
settled by decisions of this Court. The clause in question is:
"*... all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed. ..."

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

'9 2 U.S.

First. War Risk Insurance policies are contracts of the
United States. As consideration for the Government's
obligation, the insured paid prescribed monthly premiums.
White v. United States, 270 U.S. 175, 180. True, these
contracts, unlike others, were not entered into by the
United States for a business purpose. The policies
granted insurance against death or total disability without medical examination, at net premium rates based on
the American Experience Table of Mortality and three
and one-half per cent interest, the United States bearing
both the whole expense of administration and the excess
mortality and disability cost resulting from the hazards
of war. In order to effect a benevolent purpose heavy
burdens were assumed by the Government.- But the
policies, although not entered into for gain, are legal obligations of the same dignity as other contracts of the
United States and possess the same legal incidents.
War Risk Insurance, while resembling in benevolent
purpose pensions, compensation allowances, hospital and
other privileges accorded to former members of the army
and navy or their dependents, differs from them funda'The disbursements to June 30, 1933, for term and automatic
insurance (the latter provided for those who were permanently and
totally disabled or who died within 120 days after entrance into the
service and before making application for term insurance) exceeded
the premium receipts by $1,166,939,057. Administrator of Veterans'
Affairs, Report.for Year 1933, p. 28. The annual cost of administration was estimated at $1,744,038.56. Report of United States
Veterans' Bureau for 1922, p. 465. War Risk Insurance was devised
in the hope that it would, in large measure, avoid the necessity of
granting pensions. Term insurance was issued at a very low premium
rate. Over 4,684,000 persons applied before the armistice to the
amount of about $40,000,000,000 for War Risk term insurance; but
over 75 per cent. of the men who carried term insurance while in
the service never paid a premium after the war. See Report of
Bureau of War Risk Insurance for 1920, pp. 5, 7, 41; Report of
United States Veterans' Bureau for 1922, p. 456; for 1925, p. 268.

mentally in legal incidents. Pensions, compensation allowances and privileges are gratuities. They involve no
agreement of parties; and the grant v,. )Wm creates no
vested right. The benefits conferred by gratuities may be
redistributed or withdrawn at any time in the discretion
of Congress. United States v. Teller, 107 U.S. 64, 68;
Frisbiev. United States, 157 U.S. 160, 166; United States
v. Cook, 257 U.S. 523, 527. On the other hand War Risk
policies, being contracts, are property and create vested
rights. The terms of these contracts are to be found in
part in the policy, in part in the statutes under which
they are issued and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
In order to promote efficiency in administration and
justice in the distribution of War Risk Insurance benefits,
the Administration was given power to prescribe the form
of policies and to make regulations. The form prescribed
provided that the policy should be subject to all amendments to the original Act, to all regulations then in force
or thereafter adopted. Within certain limits of application this form was deemed authorized by the Act, White
v. United States, 270 U.S. 175, 180, and, as held in that
case, one whose vested rights were not thereby disturbed
could not complain of subsequent legislation affecting
the terms of the policy. Such legislation has been frequent.8 Moreover, from time to time, privileges granted

to yearly renewable term insurance." The repeal, if valid,
abrogated outstanding contracts; and relieved the United
States from all liability on the contracts without making
compensation to the beneficiaries.
Second. The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just compensation.
Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a
private individual, a municipality, a State or the United
States. Rights against the United States arising out of a
contract with it are protected by the Fifth Amendment.
United States v. Central PacificR. Co., 118 U.S. 235, 238;
United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 256 U.S. 51,
64, 67. When the United States enters into contract
relations, its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private
individuals.' That the contracts of war risk insurance
were valid when made is not questioned. As Congress
had the power to authorize the Bureau of War Risk Insurance to issue them, the due process clause prohibits
the United States from annulling them, unless, indeed,
the action taken falls within the federal police power or
some other paramount power.7

or argument, that there were supervening conditions

which authorized Congress to abrogate these contracts in
the exercise of the police or any other power. The title
of the Act of March 20, 1933, repels any such suggestion.
Although popularly known as the Economy Act, it is
entitled an "Act to maintain the credit of the United
States." Punctilious fulfillment of contractual obligations is essential to the maintenance of the credit of public as well as private debtors. No doubt there was in
March, 1933, great need of economy. In the administration of all government business economy had become
urgent because of lessened revenues and the heavy obligations to be issued in the hope of relieving widespread distress. Congress was free to reduce gratuities deemed
excessive. But Congress was without power to reduce
expenditures by abrogating contractual obligations of the
United States. To abrogate contracts, in the attempt to
lessen government expenditure, would be not the practice
of economy, but an act of repudiation. "The United
States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much
repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term
implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a State
or a municipality or a citizen." Sinking-Fund Cases,
99 U.S. 700, 719.
Third. Contracts between individuals or corporations
are impaired within the meaning of the Constitution
whenever the right to enforce them by legal process is
taken away or materially lessened." A different rule prevails in respect to contracts of sovereigns. Compare
Principalityof Monaco v. Mississippi,ante, p. 313. "The
contracts between a Nation and an individual are only
binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no

LYNCH v. UNITED STATES.
571

Opinion of the Court.

pretensions to compulsive force. They confer no right
of action independent of the sovereign will." I The rule
that the United States may not be sued without its consent is all embracing.
In establishing the system of War Risk Insurance, Congress vested in its administrative agency broad power in
making determinations of essential facts-power similar
to that exercised in respect to pensions, compensation,
allowances and other gratuitous privileges provided for
veterans and their dependents. But while the statutes
granting gratuities contain no specific provision for suits
against the United States," Congress, as if to emphasize
the contractual obligation assumed by the United States
when issuing War Risk policies, conferred upon beneficiaries substantially the same legal remedy which beneficiaries enjoy under policies issued by private corporations. The original Act provided in § 405:
"That in the event of disagreement as to a claim
under the contract of insurance between the bureau and
any beneficiary or beneficiaries thereunder, an action on
the claim may be brought against the United States in
the district court of the United States in and for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of them
resides." "
Although consent to sue was thus given when the policy issued, Congress refained power to withdraw the consent at any time. For consent to sue the United States
is a privilege accorded; not the grant of a property right
protected by the Fifth Amendment. The consent may
be withdrawn, although given after much deliberation 'and
for a pecuniary consideration. DeGroot v. United States,
Hamilton, The Federalist, No. 81.
"See Sixth, infra, p. 587.
' The provision for suit was later modified. See World War Veterans' Act 1924, § 19, as amended by Act of July 3, 1930,'.c. 849, 46

The sovereign's immunity from suit exists whatever the
character of the proceeding or the source of the right
pought to be enforced. It applies alike to causes of action
arising under acts of Congress, DeGroot v. United States,
5 Wall. 419, 431; United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328,
331; and to .those arising from some violation of rights
conferred upon the citizen by the Constitution, Schillinger
v. United States, 155 U.S. 163, 166, 168. The character
of the cause of action-the fact that it is in contract as
distinguished from tort-may be important in determining (as under the Tucker Act) whether consent to sue
was given. Otherwise, it is of no significance. For immunity from suit is an attribute of sovereignty which may
not be bartered away.
Mere withdrawal of consent to sue on policies for
yearly renewable term insurance would. not imply repudiation. When the United States creates rights in individuals against itself, it is under no obligation to provide
a remedy through the courts. United States v. Babcock,
250 U.S. 328, 331. It may limit the individual to -administrative remedies. Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S.
568, 576. And withdrawal of all remedy, administrative
as well as legal, would not necessarily imply repudiation.
So long as the contractual obligation is recognized, Congress may direct its fulfilment without the interposition
of either a court or an administrative tribunal.

LYNCH v. UNITED STATES.
571

Opinion of the Court.

Fourth. The question requiring decision is, therefore,
whether in repealing "all laws granting or pertaining to
yearly renewable term insurance" Congress aimed at the
right or merely at the remedy. It seems clear that it
intended to take away the right; and that Congress did
not intend to preserve the right and merely withdraw
consent to sue the United States.13 As Congress took
away the contractual right it had no occasion to provide
for withdrawal of the remedy. Moreover, it appears both
from the language of the repealing clause and from the
context of § 17 that Congress did not aim at the remedy.
The clause makes no mention of consent to sue. The
consent to sue had been given originally by § 405 of the
Act of 1917, which, -like the later substituted sections,
applied to all kinds of insurance, making no specific reference to yearly irenewable term policies. Obviously, Congress did not intend to repeal generally the section providing for suits. 4 For in March 1933, most of the policies
then outstanding were " converted " policies, in no way
affected by the Economy Act.1"
That Congress sought to take away the right of beneficiaries of yearly renewable term policies and not to withdraw their privilege to sue the United States, appears,
also, from an examination of the other provisions of § 17.
The section reads:
"All public laws granting medical or hospital treatment,
domiciliary care, compensation and other allowances, pen'Veteran Regulation No.8, promulgated March 31, 1933, pursuant
to this Act provides: "V. Except as stated above [matter not here

and the dependents of veterans of the Spanish-American
War, including the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine
Insurrection, and the World War, or to former members
of the military and naval service for injury or disease
incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the military
or naval service (except so far as they relate to persons
who served prior to the Spanish-American War and to
the dependents of such persons, and the retirement of
officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army, Navy,
Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) are hereby repealed, and
all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term
insurance are hereby repealed, but payments in accordance with such laws shall continue to the last day of the
third calendar month following the month during which
this Act is enacted." 10
" The rest of the section is as follows:
"The Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under the general direction
of the President shall immediately cause to be reviewed all allowed
claims under the above referred to laws and where a person is found
entitled under this Act, authorize payment or allowance of benefits
in accordance with the provisions of this Act commencing with the
first day of the fourth calendar month following the month during
which this Act is enacted and notwithstanding the provisions of
section 9 of this Act, no further claim in such cases shall be required.
Provided, That nothing contained in this section shall interfere with
payments heretofore made or hereafter to be made under contracts
of yearly renewable term insurance which have matured prior to
the date of enactment of this Act and under which payments have
been commenced, or on any judgment heretofore rendered in a court
of competent jurisdiction in any suit on a contract of yearly renewable
term insurance, or which may hereafter be rendered in any such suit
now pending: Provided further, That, subject to such regulations as
the President may prescribe, allowances may be granted for burial
and funeral expenses and transportation of the bodies (including
preparation of the bodies) of deceased veterans of any war to the
places of burial thereof in a sum not to exceed $107 in any one case.

Opinion of the Court.

That section deals principally with the many grants of
gratuities to veterans and dependents of veterans. Congress apparently assumed that there was no difference
between the legal status of these gratuities and the outstanding contracts for yearly renewable term insurance.
It used in respect to both classes of benevolences the
substantially same phrase. It repealed "all public laws"
relating to the several categories of gratuities; and it repealed "all laws granting or pertaining to" such insurance. No right to sue the United States on any of these
gratuities had been granted in the several statutes conferring them; and the right to the gratuity might be
withdrawn at any time. The dominant intention was
obviously to abolish rights, not remedies.
That Congress intended to take away the right under
outstanding yearly renewable term policies, and was not
concerned with the consent to sue thie United States
thereon, appears also from the saving clauses in § 17.
These provide that "all allowed claims under the above
referred to laws" are to be reviewed and the benefits are
to be paid "where a person is found entitled under this
Act "; and that "nothing contained in this section shall
interfere with payments to be made under contracts of
yearly renewable term insurance under which payments
have commenced, or on any judgment heretofore rendered
in a court of competent jurisdiction in any suit on a contract of yearly renewable term insurance, or which may
hereafter be rendered in any such suit now pending."

benefit of statutory or regulatory presumption of service connection)
pursuant to the provisions of the laws in effect on the date of enactment of this Act. The term 'compensation or pension' as used in
this paragraph shall not be construed to include emergency officer's
retired pay referred to in section 10 of this title."

That is, the rights under certain yearly renewable term
policies are excepted from the general repealing clause.17
Fifth. There is a suggestion that although, in repealing all laws "granting or pertaining to yearly renewable
term insurance," Congress intended to take away the
contractual right, it also intended to take away the remedy; that since it had power to take away the remedy,
the statute should be given effect to that extent, even if
void insofar as it purported to take away the contractual
right. The suggestion is at war with settled rules of
construction. It is true that a statute bad in part is not
necessarily void in its entirety. A provision within the
legislative power may be allowed to stand if it is separable from the bad. But no provision however unobjectionable in itself, can stand unless it appears both that,
standing alone, the provision can be given legal effect
and that the legislature intended the unobjectionable
provision to stand in case other provisions held bad should
fall. Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U.S. 286, 288, 290. Here,
both those essentials are absent. There is no separate
provision in § 17 dealing with the remedy; and it does
not appear that Congress wished to deny the remedy if
the repeal of the contractual right was held void under
the Fifth Amendment.
War Risk Insurance and the war gratuities were enjoyed, in the main, by the same classes of persons; and
were administered by the same governmental agency. In
respect of both, Congress had theretofore expressed its
benevolent purpose perhaps more generously than would
have been warranted in 1933 by the financial condition
of the Nation. When it became advisable to reduce the
Nation's existing expenditures, the two classes of benevolences were associated in the minds of the legislators;
and it was natural that they should have wished to sub" Compare Veteran Regulation No. 8, March 31, 1933.

ject both to the same treatment.

But it is not to be

assumed that Congress would have resorted to the device
of withdrawing the legal remedy from beneficiaries of
outstanding yearly renewable term policies if it had realized that these had contractual rights. It is, at least, as
probable that Congress overlooked the fundamental difference in legal incidents between the two classes of
benevolences dealt with in § 17 as that it wished to evade
payment of the Nation's legal obligations.
Sixth. The judgments below appear to have been based,
in the main, not on § 17 of the Economy Act, but on § 5
which provides:
"All decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under the provisions of this title, or the
regulations issued pursuant thereto, shall be. final and
conclusive on all questions of law and fact, and no other
official or court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such
decision."
This section, as the Solicitor General concedes, does not
relate to War Risk Insurance. It concerns Only grants
to veterans and their dependents--pensions, compensation allowances and special privileges, all of which are
gratuities. The purpose of the section appears to have
been .to remove the possibility of judicial relief in that
class of cases even under the special circumstances suggested in Crouch v. United States, 266 U.S. 180; Silberschein v. United States, 266 U.S. 221; United States v.
Williams, 278 U.S. 255; Smith v. United States, 57 F.
(2d) 998. Compare United States v. Meadows, 281 U.S.
271.
Seventh. The Solicitor General concedes that in No.
861 no question is presented except that of jurisdiction
dependent upon the construction of the clause in § 17 of
the Economy Act discussed above. He contends in No.
855, 'that if jurisdiction is entertained, the demurrer

should be sustained on the ground that the complaint
fails to set forth a good cause of action, since it fails to
show that the suit was brought within the period allowed
by law. This alleged defect was not pleaded or brought
to the attention of either of the courts below. Nor was it
brought by the Solicitor General to the attention of this
Court when -opposing the petition for a writ of certiorari.
We do not pass upon that question, which like others relating to the merits, will be open for consideration by the
lower courts upon the remand.
Eighth. Mention should be made of legislation by Congress enacted since the commencement of these suits.
1. Act of June 16, 1933, c. 101, § 20, 48 Stat. 309 provides:
." Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17, title I,
Public. Numbered 2, Seventy-third Congress, any claim
for yearly renewable term insurance on which premiums
were paid to the date of death of the insured . . . under
the provisions of laws repealed by said section 17 wherein
claim was duly filed pribr to March 20, 1933, may be
adjudicated by the Veterans' Administration on the proofs
and evidence received by Veterans' Administration prior
to March 20, 1933, and any person found entitled to the
benefits claimed shall be paid such benefits in accordance
with and in the amounts provided by such prior laws...."
2. Section 35 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1935, passed on March 27-28, 1934, over the
President's veto, provides:
"That notwithstanding the pr6visions of section 17 of
title I, of an Act entitled 'An Act to maintain the Credit
of the United States Government' approved March 20,
1933, and section 20 of an Act entitled 'An Act making
appropriations for the Executive offices, etc. . . .' approved June 16, 1933, any claim for yearly renewable
term insurance under the provisions of laws repealed by
said section 17,-wherein claim was duly filed prior to

Syllabus.

March 20, 1933, and on which maturity of the insurance
contract had been determined by the Veterans' Administration prior to March 20, 1933, and where payments
could not be made because of the provisions of the Act
of March 20, 1933, or under the provisions of the Act
of June 16, 1933, may be adjudicated by the Veterans'
Administration and any person found entitled to yearly
renewable term insurance benefits claimed shall be paid
such benefits in accordance with and in the amounts proL
vided by such prior laws." "
The provision in the Act of June 16, 1933, which was
enacted before the entry of judgments by the district
courts, does not appear to have been considered by the
lower courts. The provision in the Act of March 27-28,
1934, was enacted after the filing in this Court of the
petitions for certiorari but before the writs were granted.
As neither of these Acts was referred to by the Solicitor
General or by counsel for the petitioners, we assume that
there is nothing in them, or in any action taken thereunder, which should affect the disposition of the cases
now before us. Any such matter also will be open for
consideration by the lower courts upon the remand.
