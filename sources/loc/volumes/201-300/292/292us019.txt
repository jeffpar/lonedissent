McGARRITY v. BRIDGE COMM'N.
Per Curiam.

16

In this instance, relief cannot be afforded by treating
the decree of the District Court as appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals, notwithstanding the participation
of three judges (cf. Healy v. Ratta, 67 F. (2d) 554, 556),
as the time for appeal to that Court has expired. In these
circumstances, without passing upon the merits, the 'appropriate action is to reverse the decree below and to remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings to be taken independently of ยง 266 of the Judicial
Code.
Reversed.

RIVER BRIDGE COMMISSION

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, NO. 1,
PHILADELPHIA

No. 635.

COUNTY,

PENNSYLVANIA.

Argued March 13, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.

Appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question properly
presented to the state court, in a suit for damage caused by a
change of street grade to a lessee of abutting property.

The appeal was from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Pennsylvania, 311 Pa. 436, affirming a judgment of the
Court of Conmmon Pleas, to which latter court the record
had been remitted when the appeal to this, Court was
taken.
Mr. John Robert Jones for appellant.
Mr. Harold D. Saylor, Deputy Attorney General of
Pennsylvania, with whom 34'r. Win. A. Schnader, Attorney General, was on the brief, for appellees.

thority of the State Commission which directed the
change of grade was conferred by the state statute of
July 9, 1919, P.L. 814. The state court held that the
damage in question was merely consequential, that the
allowance of recovery therefor was a matter of legislative grace and not of right, and that the statute as invoked by appellant was invalid as it did not conform to
the requirements of the state constitution. 311 Pa. 436;
166 Atl. 895. No federal question was raised prior to
a petition for rehearing in the Supreme Court of the
State, which was denied without more. Appellant insists that questions under the Fourteenth Amendment
were thus raised at the first opportunity. The petition
for rehearing does not appear in the record. Nor does
the record contain the pleadings, the evidence, or any findings by the state court upon the questions of fact involved. Appellant relies upon statements in the opinion
of the state court but these fail to support appellant's
contentions.
The appeal is dismissed for the want of a properly presented substantial federal question. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 360, 362, 363; Dewey v: Des Moines,
