CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 873.

Argued May 8, 9, 1934.-Decided May 28, 1934.

1. A father transferred securities irrevocably to a trustee, in trust,
to pay income and eventually the principal to his son. Within less
thmn two years the trustee sold the' securities for a price which
exceeded their value at the time of the creation of the trust and
exceeded still more the price for which the trusty had acquired
them. Held:
(1) That the shares wer6 "acquired by gift," by the trustee,
within the meaning of § 202 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1921;
and, under that Act, the basis for ascertaining the gain derived
from the sale was "the same as that which it would have been in
the hands of the donor," i.e., the cost of the shares to the trustor.
P. 462.
(2) The shares were "capital assets," defined by § 206 (a) (6)
of the Act as "property acquired and held by the taxpayer for
profit or investment for more than two years," and the gain was
therefore taxable under that section at 12 %, and not at the
normal and surtax rates. In applying the definition, the tenures
of donor and trustee must be treated as continuous. P. 463.
(3) The purpose of this provision of § 206 was to lessen the discouragement of sales of capital assets caused by high normal and
surtaxes, in which respect there is no distinction between gains
derived from a sale made by an owner who has held the property
for more than, two years and those resulting from one by a donee
whose tenure plus that of the donor exceeds that period. P. 466.

(4) No valid ground has been suggested for requiring tenures of
capital assets to be added to get the base under § 202 (a) (2) and
forbidding their combination for finding the rate under § 206
(a)(6). P. 467.
2. The rule requiring that an unambiguous statute shall be given
effect according to its language is not to be put aside to avoid
hardships that may result from carrying out the legislative purpose. P. 464.
3. But adherence to the letter of a statutory provision without regard
to other parts of the Act and to the legislative history will often
defeat its object. P. 464.
4. Generally, questions as to the meaning intended do not arise until
the language used is compared with the facts or transactions in
respect of which the intent and purpose are to be ascertained.
P. 465.
5. Mere change of language in a regnactment does not necessarily
indicate an intention to change the law. The purpose may be to
prevent misapprehension of the existing law by clarifying what
was doubtful. P. 468.

CERTIORARI * to review a judgment modifying a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 27 B.T.A. 1127.

Mr. Erwin N. Grinwold, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, Mr. James
W. Morris, and Miss Helen R. Carloss Were on the brief,
for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Under § 202 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which
is applicable to "property, acquired by gift," the basis
for determining the gain from the sale of the stock by the
trustee was its cost to the grantor. In the present case
the trustee who sold the stock received it by an irrevocable transfer in trust, which completely divested the
grantor of all ownership of or interest in the property.
The transfer of title from the donor to the trustee was
made by delivery of the securities and was without consideration. This was a gift in trust, as distinguished from
See Tables of Cases Reported in this volume.

HELVERING v. N.Y. TRUST CO.

a gift direct, but it was none the less a gift. If there.
could have been any doubt on this question, it is removed,
we submit, by this Court's decision in Burnet v. Guggenheim, 288 U.S. 280.
A gift is a transaction affecting the legal title to property. The essential requirements of a gift have been
developed at law as distinguished from in equity. Gifts
may be beneficial or otherwise; but if a gratuitous transfer does not result to the benefit of the transferee, the
reasons lie in equity-the transaction is none the less a
gift at law.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue has consistently construed the phrase "acquired by gift" to include irrevocable transfers in trust. These rulings have not been
revoked and are still in effect. This long continued administrative interpretation of the statute is entitled to
great weight.
In the Revenue Act of 1924, Congress included a specific
provision relating to transfers in trust. We submit that
in doing so Congress was enacting into law the accepted
administratve interpretation in order to remove any
possible doubt as to the correctness of that interpretation.
The gain from the sale hy the trustee is not taxable
as a capital gain under § 206 of the Revenue Act of 1921.
In that section the term "capital assets" is defined as
property " held by the taxpayer" for more than two years.
In this case, the trust is the taxpayer, and it is undisputed that the trust had not held the property for two
years. There is no ambiguity in the statute. It allows
no room for construction.
The conclusion that the property sold by the trustee
did not constitute" capital assets" is not only required by
the plain text of the statute itself, but this was the contemporaneous construction of the Treasury Department
which has been uniformly followed by the Board of Tax

458

292 U.S.

Appeals and by the courts, until the decision of the court
below in the present case.
The rule for which the taxpayer contends was expressly
adopted in § 208 of the Revenue Act of 1926. But such
a change in the' law can not authorize construction of an
earlier Act not consonant with the language there employed. The change shows a recognition of the administrative construction and a desire on the part of Congress
to establish a different rule for the future. Congress
could have made the change retroactive if it had desired;
but it did not do so.
Mr. Chauncey Newlin, with whom Messrs. J. DuPratt
White and Russell D. Morrill were on the brief, for the
New York Trust Co., Trustee.
As to basis, the statute does not apply because the
trustee did not acquire the trust corpus by "gift." The
trust was merely an instrumentality for effecting the gifts
to the life tenant and remaindermen. The statute would
be applicable if they had sold the property given to them.
Against the receipt of trust corpus the trustee gives an
undertaking which deprives him of all benefit therefrom.
The property is not a "gift" to him. For present purposes, his position is analogous to-that of a bailee, an attorney-in-fact, a custodian, or a nominee, in none of which
cases is the transferee a donee. The view that a trustee
does not acquire "by gift" within the meaning of § 202
(a) (2) has been incorporated in the Revenue Act of 1924
and all subsequent Revenue Acts, and this construction by
legislation should be given effect. To apply the statute
would conflict with the rule that the trust is a taxpayer
separate and distinct from the beneficiaries. The Board
of Tax Appeals has not been consistent oh this question
and earlier decisions to a different effect should be followed. Section 202 (a) (2) not being applicable, the

proper basis is value at the time the stock was transferred
in trust.
As to Capital Gain: The basis section and the capital
gain section should be read together and the policy of
the law and the object of Congress should be given effect.
The purpose Qf the basis provision was to put the donee
in the position of his donor. This theory should be applied
with consistency; otherwise, the donee will be in a less
favorable position than the donor and the object of the
law will be defeated pro tanto. The purpose of the capital gain section was to induce taxable transactions otherwise prevented by the excessive tax burden resulting from
applying graduated rates to a profit representing an appreciation over a period of years. Hence, it must have
been the intention of Congress to measure the period
by reference to the time the gain accrued. That view
best promotes the end desired. The change in the 1926
Act obviating the question was interpretative. The purpose and policy of the law lead to that conclusion. The
change is stated in the interpretative form. It appears
from the Committee Reports on the 1926 Act that the
change was considered interpretative as to nontaxable
exchanges and distributions. It approved Treasury Department Regulations in those cases. The Reports indicate, and it is only reasonable to assume, that the concurrent change as to gifts was made for the same purpose.
The terms of the statute in fact are not clear and the
word "held" must be interpreted in any case. In that
event, it should be interpreted in a way consistent with
the policy of the law, and not in a way which would defeat
its purpose and impose an unintended burden. The
adoption of the 1924 Act without change, and after a
short-lived interpretation of this provision by the Treasury Department, did not constitute legislative recognition
of that interpretation. There is no indication that Con-

gress considered the matter before the passage of the
1924 Act. The decisions cited by the Commissioner do
not support his position; whereas there are many decisions of this Court which do support the taxpayer's
position.
MR. JUSTIcE BUTLER delivered the opinioi of the Court.

This controversy arises out of the calculation of an
income tax on the gain realized on the sale of property
by a trustee in 1922. April 27, 1906, oneMatthiessen acquired 6,000 shares of stock at a cost of $141,375. Its
value on March 1, 1913, was less than cost. December
4, 1921, desiring to make provision for his son, Erard, he
transferred the stock to the New York Trust Company in
trust for him with remainder over in case of his death.
When the trust was created-the market value of the stock
was $577,500. The trustee sold it in 1922 for $603,385.
In'the tax return for that year the trustee included
$87,385 as the gain resulting from the sale. That figure
ivas reached by subtracting the cost of the shares to the
trustor, then claimed to be $516,000, from the amount.-the

trustee received for them. But the trusfee then, as -it
always has, insisted that the gain should be calculated on
the basis of the value at the time of the creation of the
trust. And it applied the rate of 12%/ per cent., applicable to capital gains. The Commissioner ascertained
gain on the principle adopted in the return but found the
cost to trusior to'be $141,375. He applied the normal
and surtax rates that ordinarily are laid upon the incomes
of individuals and by the use of these factors arrived at
ar additional assessment of $238,275.95.' The Board of
Tax Appeals sustained the determination. 27 B.T.A.
On the basis of the return made the tax was $14,391.71.

On the

construction of § 202 (a) (2) for which trustee contends the tax
would be $7,714.00.

HELVERING v. N. Y. TRUST CO.

Opinion of the Court.

-1127. The lower court held that the gain had been correctly ascertained, but that it was taxable at 121/2 per
cent. 68 F. (2d) 19. These writs were granted on petition of the Commissioner and cross-petition of the trustee.
The questions are: (1) Whether the gain resulting from
the trustee's sale is the difference between price paid by
trustor and that redeived by trustee, and (2) if so, whether
the 121/2 per cent. rate is applicable.
The Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, governs. Section 2 (9) defines taxpayer to include any person, trust or
estate subject to a tax imposed by the Act. Section 202
(a) provides: "That the basis for ascertaining the gain
derived . . .from a sale . . . of property . . . shall be
the cost of such property; except that . . . (2) In the
case of such property, acquired by gift after December 31,
1920, the basis shall be the same as that which it would
have in the hands of the donor." Section 206 (a) (6)
defines capital assets to be "property acquired and held
by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than
two years ' and (b) provides that the net gain from the
sale of capital assets may be taxed at the rate of 12
per cent. instead of at the ordinary rates. Section 219 (a)
declares that the normal and surtax on net incomes of
individuals shall apply to the income of property held
in trust, including (3) income held for future distribution; (b) the fiduciary is required to make the return of
income for the trust. And subsection (c) provides that
in cases under (a) (3) the tax shall be imposed upon the
net income of the trust and shall be paid by the fiduciary.
By the trust indenture, which recites mutual covenants
and agreements and the payment of $10 by each to the
other as the consideration, the trustor did "sell, assign,
transfer, and convey" the 6,000 shares " in trust, nevertheless, for the benefit of" his son, Erard, "to be administered by the trustee" under specified terms and condi-

292 U.S.

tions among which are these: The trustee was required
to hold the shares and any property purchased out of the
avails, to collect and retain income until the twenty-first
birthday of Erard, then to pay him the accumulated
income, thereafter to- pay him current income until he
attained the age of twenty-five years, and at that time
to deliver to him the principal and undistributed income.
During the life of the trustor, the trustee was not to sell
or reinvest without the written consent and approval of
the trustor. In case of Erard's death before the age of
twenty-five, the entire estate was to go to other sons of
the trustor.
The trustor irrevocably disposed of the shares. He did
not sell but made a gift. Burnet v. Guggenheim, 288 U.S.
280. He gave the trustee legal title temporarily to be held
to enable it to conserve, administer and transfer the propprty for the use and benefit of his son to whom he gave the
beneficial interest. It may rightly be said that the trustee
and beneficiary " acquired by gift " as meant by § 202 (a).2
If the broad definition in § 2 (9) stood alone, either might
be regarded as the taxpayer but it is qualified by the rule
that the trustee must pay the tax. It follows that the
trustee properly may be regarded as the taxpayer and, for
the purpose of calculating the gain, as having assumed the
place of the trustor. Section 202 (a) (2) was enacted to
prevent evasion of taxes on capital gains. Taft v. Bowers,
278 U.S. 470, 479, 482. And see Cooper v. United States,
280 U.S. 409. Transfers to trustees for the benefit of
others are clearly within the reason for the enactment.

Opinion of the Court.

They may be used to avoid burdens intended to be imposed, quite as effectively as may gifts that are directly
made. The difference between the ost to the trustor in
1906 and the amount for which the trustee sold in 1922
was rightly taken as taxable income of the trust.
We come to the question whether the gain derived
from the trustee's sale is taxable at 121/2 per cent. That
rate is no.t applicable unless the shares were "capital
assets" defined by § 206 (a) (6) to be "property acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment
for more than two years." The time between the creation of the trust and the sale was less than the specified
period and, if the words alone are to be looked to, the
shares were not by the taxpayer "held . . . for more

than two years." Soon after the passage of the Act the
Income Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue ruled
that property transferred to a trustee, for purposes and
upon terms and conditions analogous to those expressed
in the indenture before us, which remained in his hands
less than two years was not "capital assets" and that
the resulting gain was not taxable at the 121/2 per cent.
rate. That construction was followed by the Board of
Tax Appeals, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.' The Commissioner says that the words of the
definition are free from ambiguity and that the statute
contains no exception. From an opinion of this court he

'invokes these statements: "If the language be clear it is
conclusive. There can be no construction where there
is nothing to construe." United States v. Hartwell, 6
Wall. 385, 396. He suggests that his construction was
approved by the Revenue Act of 1924, § 208 (a) (8), 43
Stat. 263, which retained the definition, and that the provision in the Revenue Act of 1926, § 208 (a) (8), 44 Stat.
19, which conforms to the construction for which the
trustee here contends operated to make a change in the
law.
The rule that where the statute contains no ambiguity,
it must be taken literally and given effect according to
its language is a sound one not to be put aside to. avoid
hardships that may sometimes result from giving effect
to the legislative purpose. Commissioner of Immigration
v. Gottlieb, 265 U.S. 310, 313. Bate Refrigerating Co. v.
Sulzberger, 157 U.S. 1, 37. But the expounding of a
statutory provision strictly according t6 the letter without
regard to other parts of the Act and legislative history
would often defeat the object intended to be accomplished. Speaking through Chief Justice Taney in Brown
v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, this court said (p. 194): "'It
is well settled that, in interpreting a statute, the court will
not look merely to a particular clause in which general
words may be used, but will take in connection with it
the whole statute (or statutes on the same subject) and
the objects and policy of the law, as indicated by its
various provisions, and give to it such a construction as
will carry into execution the will of the Legislature, as
thus ascertained, according to its true intent and meaning." Quite recently in Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S.
178, we said (p. 194): "It is the duty of this Court to give
effect to the intent of Congress. Primarily this intent is
ascertained by giving the words their natural significance,
but if this leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the -policy of the legislation as a whole, we must

Opinion of the Court.

examine the matter further. We may then look to the
reason of the enactment and inquire into its antecedent
history and give it effect in accordance with its design and
purpose, sacrificing, if necessary, the literal meaning
in order that the purpose may not fail." And in
Barrett v. Van Pelt, 268 U.S. 85, 90, we applied .the
rule laid down in People v. Utica Ins. Co., 15 Johns.
358, 381, that "a thing which is within the intention.Df
the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as
if it were within the letter, and a thing which is within
the letter of the statute, is not within the statute, unless
it is within the intention of the makers."
The part of the definition under consideration' is this:
"held . . . for more than two years." Although on superficial inspection the words appear to be entirely clear,
the Treasury Department deemed constructioh necessary
to disclose the meaning that, upon consideration .of the
actual transactions of the taxpayers, it found Congress to.
have intended. Regulations 62, Art. 1651, declares:
"The specific property sold or exchanged must have been
held for more than two years, but in the case of a stock
dividend the prescribed period applies to the original
stock and the stock received as a dividend considered as
a unit and where property is exchanged for other property . . . the prescribed period applies to the property
exchanged and the property received in exchange considered as a unit." Construed strictly according to the
letter, the provision would not include shares received as
a dividend less than two years before the sale, or property
taken in exchange within that period. The need of this
regulation illustrates how ambiguities requiring construction often exist where upon first reading the words seem
clear. Generally, questions as to the meaning intended
do not arise until the language used is compared with the
facts or transactions in respect of which the intent and
purpose are to be ascertained. Bradley v. Washington,

Legislative reasons for applying the lower rate to _capital gains give support to the construction.for which the
trustee contends. The report of the Committee on Ways
and Means states: "The sale of . . . capital assets is

now seriously retarded by the fact that gains and profits
earned over a series of years are under the present law
taxed as a lump sum (and the amount of surtax greatly
enhanced thereby) in the year in which the profit is
realized: Many such sales, with their possible profit
taking and consequent increase of the tax revenue, have
been blocked by this feature of the present law. In order
to permit such transactions to go forward without fear
of a prohibitive tax, the proposed bill, in section 206,
adds a new section . . . to the income tax, providing that

where the net gain derived from the sale or other disposition of capital assets would, under the ordinary procedure, be subjected to an income tax in excess of 15 per
cent. [afterwards changed to 121/2 per cent.] the tax upon
capital net gain shall be limited to that rate. It is believed that the passage of this provision would materially
increase the revenue, not only because it would stimulate profit-taking transactions but because the limitation
of 15 per cent. is also applied to capital losses. Under
present conditions there are likely to be more'losses than
gains." 67th Congress, 1st Session, House Report No.
350, p. 10. See also Senate Report No. 275, p. 12. In
respect of the legislative purpose to lessen hindrance
caused by high normal and surtaxes, there is no distinction between, gains derived from a sale made by an owner
who has held the property for more than two years and
those resulting from one by a donee whose tenure plus
that of the donor exceeds that period.

HELVERING v. N.Y. TRUST CO.
455

467

Opinion of the Court.

Here the taxable gain was ascertained by putting together the periods in which the shares were held by
trustor and trustee respectively. The taxable gain was
the same as if the former held continuously from the
time of purchase in 1906 until the sale in 1922. But to
ascertain the applicable rate the Commissioner broke
the continuity. If the trustor had held until the sale,
the 12/2 per cent. rate would have been applicable and
the tax would have been substantially less than onefourth of the amount assessed against the trustee who,
for the purpose of calculating the gain, was substituted
for the trustor.'
Sections 202 (a) (2) and 206 (a) (6) are included in
the same Act and are applicable respectively to different
elements of the same or like transactions and are not to be
regarded as wholly unrelated. While undoubtedly legally
possible and within the power of Congress, the methods
adopted and results attained by the Commissioner are
so lacking in harmony as to suggest that the continuity
required to be used to get the base was also intended for
use in finding the rate. No valid ground has been suggested fdr requiring tenures to be added for the one purpose and forbidding combination for the other. The legislative purpose to be served by the application of the
lower rate upon capital gains is directly opposed to the
Commissioner's construction. There is no ground for
discrimination such as that to which the trustee was
subjected. It is to be inferred that Congress did not
intend penalization of that sort.
The Commissioner's suggestion that, by retaining the
same definition in the 1924 Act, Congress approved the
construction for which he contends is without, merit. The
' The deficiency assessed, $238,275.91, plus original assessment, $14,391.71, makes the total $252.667.66. The taxpayer's calculation
indicates that if the 121/2 per cent. rate were applied the total tax
would be $58,921.51.

definition had not been construed in any Treasury Decision, by the Board of Tax Appeals or by any court prior
to that enactment. The dates of all constructions of
-the definition to which our attention has been called are
shown in the margin.5 The Regulation above referred to
was approved February 15, 1922. In respect of the question here involved, it puts no construction upon the definition. The rulings, I.T. 1379, 1660 and 1889, cited by the
Commissioner were made before the passage of the 1924
Act but they "have none of the force or effect of Treasury
Decisions and do not commit the Department to any interpretation of the law." See cautionary notice published
ip the bulletins containing these rulings. It does not appear that the attention of Congress had been called to any
such construction. There is no ground on which to infer
that by the 1924 Act Congress intended to approve it.
The Revenue Act of 1926, § 208 (a) (8)6 contains substantially the same language as that used in the 1921 Act
to define capital assets. That part of the subdivision is
followed by rules for determining the period for which
the 'taxpayer has held the property. Among them is one
applicable to facts such as those presented in the case be"ore us. It is substantially the same as the construction
for which the trustee contends. Mere change of language
does not necessarily indicate intention to change the law.
The purpose of the variation may be to clarify what was
doubtful and so to safeguard against misapprehension as

definition in the Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926 and the
legislative purpose underlying it, the contention that the
new words were added to change the meaning of "capital
assets" as defined in the earlier Acts is without force.
The definition so clarified was not new law but "a

Within the meaning of § 202 (a) of the Revenue Act
of 1921 the trustee acquired the trust res by gift. But
reference must be had to §§ 206 and 219 to ascertain the
rate of tax to be applied to the gain on the sale. These
are distinct sections, found not in juxtaposition with 202,
but in portions of the Act dealing with unrelated topics;
the one with "Capital Gains" and the other with
"Estates and Trusts." Confessedly the first grants an
exemption from the normal rate of tax and allows payment at a lower rate only to a "taxpayer" who realizes
gain from the sale of a capital asset which he (the "taxpayer ") has held for profit or investment for over two
years. The second, in words too plain to be misunderstood, designates the trustee of a trust such as the one
here in question as the taxpayer. The unambiguous
mandate of the Act should be enforced.
1. Under the recognized rules of construction we should
give the words of the statute their ordinary and common
meaning. Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284 U.S.
552, 560. If the language be plain there is nothing to
construe. Hamilton v. Rathbone, 175 U.S. 414, 419;
Thompson v. United States, 246 U.S. 547, 551. We cannot enact a law under the pretense of construing one.

Nor can we avoid the plain meaning of a statute by
construction, so-called, because we think as Written it
begets "hard and objectionable or absurd consequences,
which probably were not within the contemplation" of
its framers. Crooks v. Harrelson,282 U.S. 55. Where, as
in the present case, the provision is one granting an
exemption from the full rate of taxation, doubts must be
resolved against the taxpayer. Heiner v. Colonial Trust
Co., 275 U.S. 232, 235.
2. For twelve years after the passage of the Act the
administrative rulings uniformly denied the benefit of
the capital gains sections of the Act of 1921 to a donee
who had not himself held the property 'over two years.
These are entitled to respectful -consideration and will
not be disregarded except for weighty reasons. Fawcus
Machine Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 375, 378. Two
Courts of Appeals have decided against the trustee's contention. In the face of this unbroken agreement of the
executive and judicial departments, we should be slow
to announce a contrary view.
3: The reason assigned for ignoring the plain import of
the terms used in §§ 206 and 219 is that the provisions,
read in their ordinary sense, bring about a result thought
to be contradictory of the paramount purpose to permit
the payment of tax on capital gains at a reduced rate.
The suggestion is that Congress inadvertently omitted a
provision whereby the tacking of the tenures of donor
and donee would be allowed for finding the rate, since it
has required such tacking for ascertaining the base. It is
said that it would be absurd to attribute any other intent to the framers of the law. But there is no necessary
inconsistency in the two provisions, literally applied.
Plainly the requirement that a donee should calculate
his gain on the value paid by his donor was to prevent
evasions, through transfer and immediate sale by the
donee, who would claim the value at the date of the gift

as the base and assert that he had made no gain. There
is no incongruity in declaring that in the case of a gift
the donee shall pay tax at the full rate unless he shall
have held the property a full two years. Congress might
well think it proper thus to condition the privilege of a
,reduced rate to one who paid nothing for the property.
Assuming, however, for the sake of argument, that there
is a logical inconsistency between the prescribed method
for arriving at the base and that for ascertaining the
rate, it is the province of Congress alone to remove it.
There is no abstract justice in any system of taxation.
Nothing could involve more dangerous consequences, than
that the courts should rewrite plain provisions of a tax
act in order to bring them into harmony with a supposed
general policy. Such a principle of decision would embark us on a sea of construction whose bounds it is difficult to envisage. Every revenue act embodies policies
which conflict to some extent with those elsewhere in the
Act evinced. Income tax legislation is a continuous
series of corrections and amendments in an effort to make
the policy of taxation more congruous.
The very sections extending the relief of a reduced
rate on capital gains, teach us how inconsistently the
principle has been followed and how impossible and improper it would be for a court to rewrite the sections in
an effort to make them logically consistent.
The Act omitted to impose any limitation of 12 per
cent. on capital net losses. If, therefore, a taxpayer had
no capital gains during the year, he could deduct his
entire capital losses from his ordinary income.1 This
omission was cured by the Revenue Act of 1926, which
reduced the permissible deduction from the tax on net
income to 121/2 per cent. of capital net loss.' The amend'§ 202 (a) (2); § 206 (a) (2); § 206 (b); 42 Stat. 229, 232-3.

ment of 1926, in turn, leaves a glaring inconsistency, for
though .the taxpayer may have no actual income, 'et as a
result of the application of the mandatory 12 per cent.
rate to capital net losses, he may have to pay a tax.'
Under the Act of 1921 capital-assets were so defined as
to exclude property held for personal use or consumption
of the taxpayer or his family.' By the Revenue Act of
1924 and later Acts the exception was omitted. 5 It results that whereas the taxpayer may now include such
property as the residence occupied by him, his automobiles, his jewels, and similar items, in respect to gains, he
may not include them with respect to losses, for no deduction whatever for losses is permitted in the case of
property held for personal use or consumption.'
Instances might be multiplied of logical inconsistency
in the incidence of the capital gain or loss provisions; but
this court is not at liberty, because it thinks the provisions inconsistent or illogical, to rewrite them in order
to bring them into harmony with its views as to the
underlying purpose of Congress.
4: The sections in question 'were rebnacted without
change in the Revenue Act of 1924. If, as is suggested,
omission of a provision permitting one circumstanced as
this trustee to have the benefit of the reduced rate in virtue of his donor's as well as his own tenure was an inad' See § 208 (c), 44 Stat. 20. As stated in Regulations 69, Art. 1654,
by 208 (b), if the taxpayer has a capital net gain he has an election
whether to return it under the capital gains and losses provisions;
but the limitation with respect to a capital net loss provided in 208
(c) will be applied irrespective of the taxpayer's election.

vertence as respects the Act of 1921, it is curious that
the same inadvertence occurred in the enactment of the
1924 Act, despite the fact that the rulings of the department had been against the trustee's present contention.
The section was amended by the Act of 1926 so as to
allow the donee to tack his donor's tenure to make up the
required two years." In reporting it the committees of
the Senate and House both referred to this as an amendment of the law. The change was recommended in connection with two other alterations of language, both intended to confirm rulings of the department. In referring
to this particular alteration the committees said:
"The same question arises in the case of property received by gift after December 31, 1920. The amendment
provides that the period in which the property was held
by the donor shall be added to the period in which the
property was held by the donee in determining whether
or not the property so received falls within the capital
gain or loss section." I
Certainly this language is far from compelling the conclusion pressed upon us, that the amendment was merely
a confirmation of the understanding of Congress as to the
effect of the earlier Acts.
The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for the calculation of the tax to the trustee at
ordinary rates for the reason that it did not' hold the
capital assets for two years, so as to entitle it to the 12/2
per cent. rate.
