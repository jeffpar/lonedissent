MINNICH v. GARDNER ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 669. Argued March 15, 16, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.
1. If the object of a judgment creditor in having an execution levied
on goods of the debtor is merely to obtain a lien, the lien will be
postponed in favor of subsequent purchasers and execution creditors; but, a subsequent direction to the sheriff to proceed with the
the sale has the effect of reviving the priority of the lien as against
all other liens or rights acquired after such direction. P. 50.
2. This is the general rule and the rule in Pennsylvania. P. 51.
3. Petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed seventeen months after
levy of execution on personal property of the bankrupt, and nine
days after the execution creditor had directed the sheriff to sell.
Held, that the lien of the creditor was good. P. 52.

66 F. (2d) 561, reversed.
291 U.S. 654, to review the affirmance of an
order denying preference to an execution creditor's lien
.on a fund resulting from a sale of the goods by the debtor's
trustee in bankruptcy. The order overruled an allowance
of the priority by the referee.
CERTIORARI,

Mr. John A. Minnich, pro 8e.
Mr. A. E. Kountz, with whom Messrs. Clarence A. Fry
and J. Colvin Wright were on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JusTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner, on March 21, 1929, recovered two judgments
in a Pennsylvania state court against the King Motor
Conmpany, the larger one being for something over $6,000.
March 26 following, execution was issued thereon, and on
March 27 the sheriff levied under the execution upon the
personal property of the motor company, endorsing his

levy upon the writ. On April 15 the sheriff returned
"goods on hand not sold." Subsequently, on various
dates, a writ, an alias writ, and pluries writs of venditioni
exponas were issued, upon each of which the sheriff made
return to the effect that goods on hand were not sold or
writ not executed for want of time. On August 21, 1930,
nearly seventeen months after the levy of execution, petitioner directed the sheriff in writing that he must advertise
all the goods taken under the original levy and sell them
immediately. On the same day the sheriff advertised the
goods for sale to be held August 29 following. August 25 a
Pennsylvania state court of equity appointed a receiver
for the King Motor Company and ordered a stay of the
execution until final determination of the matter. August
30 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against
the motor company, upon which an adjudication of bankruptcy was made on September 19. All the personal
property of the motor company having been sold by the
trustee, it was agreed that $1,776.17, being fifty 1er cent,
of the proceeds of such sale, represented the value of the
goods levied' upon in behalf of petitioner on March 27,
1929, and included in the trustee's sale. The referee in
bankruptcy, after deducting for the costs which would
have been incurred if the goods had been sold by the
sheriff, awarded that sum to petitioner.
The referee found, among other things, that petitioner
had issued the writ of execution with an intention to
collect his money, which he never relinquished or interrupted; that he had no intention to refrain from exacting
payment or helping the debtor to hinder other creditors;
that the indulgence was good business policy when it is
considered that petitioner realized less than one-third of
the amount called for by the execution. The referee
concluded that petitioner had acted in good faith.
On review the federal district court, sitting in bankruptcy, held that petitioner had no valid lien against the

fund and was not entitled to any distribution ahead of
certain priority wage claims. The circuit court of appeals
affirmed, holding that petitioner had made his levy solely
for the purpose of acquiring a lien without a genuine intention of proceeding promptly for the collection of his
debt, that he had not met the test of good faith, and,
therefore, had failed to establish his lien upon the fund.
66 F. (2d) 561.
Conceding that petitioner intended not to proceed
promptly for the collection of his debt, and that his levy
was made solely for the purpose of acquiring a lien, we
think the conclusion drawn therefrom by the lower
court-that he had failed to establish his lien upon the
fund-does not follow, since it fails to give effect to the
positive order of the petitioner, made nine days before the
bankruptcy proceedings were begun, directing the sheriff
to proceed at once under the original levy to advertise for
sale and sell the goods. The effect of the intention and
purpose ascribed to petitioner would be to destroy the
priority of the lien obtained by his levy and thereby expose him to the risk of having his execution postponed in
favor of purchasers and subsequent execution creditors.
It, nevertheless, would continue good against the judgment debtor and all others not acquiring rights or liens.
This, undoubtedly, is the general rule (e.g., In re Zeis, 245
Fed. 737, 739; In re Schwab PrintingCo., 59 F. (2d) 726,
728; Keel v. Larkin, 72 Ala. 493, 502-503), and is fully
recognized by the Pennsylvania decisions. Kent, Santee
& Co.'s Appeal, 87 Pa. 165, 167; McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 85 Pa. 317, 322; Mentz v. Hamman, 5 Whart.
(Pa.) 150, 153; Fletcher's Appeal, 17 Leg. Int. (Phila.
1860) 300. In Eberle v. Mayer, 1 Rawle (Pa.) 366, it was
held that aff order given by an execution creditor to stay
proceedings on his execution until further directions was
a waiver of his priority in favor of a second execution received by the sheriff during the pendency of the stay. By

Opinion of the Court.

such order, it was said (p. 369), "the plaintiff's execution
must be considered as dormant, and constructively
fraudulent, as against the subsequent execution."
The general rule is equally well established that in the
absence of any intervening rights or liens a direction to
the sheriff to proceed with the sale has the effect of reviving the rights obtained by the original levy, that is to say,
of reviving not the lien, but the priority of the lien as
against all other liens and rights acquired after such direction. In re Zeis, supra; In re Schwab Printing Co.,
supra; Miller v. Kosch, 74 Hun (N.Y.) 50, 52; 26 N.Y.S.
183; Sweetser v. Matson, 153 Ill. 568, 584; 39 N.E. 1086.
We are of opinion that this general rule obtains in Pennsylvania. It was recognized as applicable to a Pennsylvania judgment as early as 1811 in Berry v. Smith, 3
Wash.C.C. 60, Fed. Cas. No. 1359. The judgment considered in that case had been rendered by the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania, and a fieri facias had issued with
direction to the sheriff not to levy it until further instructions. A few days later the sheriff was directed to proceed
with the levy. It was held that a second execution levied
in the meantime, if pursued, would take preference, but
otherwise if the second execution were issued after the
countermand. Mr. Justice Washington, delivering the
opinion, said: "The order of suspension deprives the act

of the officer, in pursuance of it, of all its force and effect,
until it is restored by a countermand; and if, in the meantime, a second execution is taken out and levied, the former must be postponed;-not so, if the second execution
issues subsequent to such countermand; and upon this
distinction, the decision of the case of Huber v. Schnell,
[1 Browne, 16] in the common pleas of this state, seems
to be entirely correct."
In Freeburger'sAppeal, 40 Pa. 244, it was held that an
execution issued only for the purpose of a lien will be postponed to a subsequent execution issued in good faith. It

appeared there that the sheriff had been instructed, when
the execution was placed in his hands, not to proceed until
further orders, and thereafter to make a levy but not sell.
Subsequently the sheriff was told to go on and sell; but
the evidence did not make clear that the last order was
given prior to the issue of the second execution. The
court, therefore, sustained the lien of the second execution,
saying, "All this," referring to the evidence, "leaves it
quite uncertain whether the orders to sell under the first
execution were prior or subsequent to the issue of the second. But as it is clearly established that the first was used
merely as a security until those orders were given, it is
incumbent upon Cameron & Billmeyer [first judgment
creditors] to prove affirmatively that they were given before the sheriff received tho second writ. This they failed
to do, and their execution, therefore, has lost its priority."
This decision clearly imports the converse of the proposition, namely, that if it had been shown that the orders to
sell were given before the receipt of the second execution,
the first execution would not have lost its priority. See 2
Freeman on Executions, ยง206, p. 1043, n. 138. Our attention has been called to no Pennsylvania decision, and our
examination discloses none, which conflicts with that conclusion. In the present case, the proof establishes and
the court below concedes that an order to sell, which antedated by nine days the filing of the involuntary petition
in bankruptcy, was in fact given.
Since the effect of that order was to revive the priority
of the lien, not to create a new one, and since that lien
had attached long prior to the beginning of the four
months' period preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, it was not affected by the provisions of ยง 67 (f)
of the Bankruptcy Act, which declare all liens obtained,
etc., within such period null and void. In re Zeis, supra,
740-741; In re Schwab PrintingCo., supra, 728, and cases
cited.

Respondents suggest that, in any event, the case involves the further question whether, as wage claimants,
each of them is entitled under a designated Pennsylvania
statute to priority to the extent of $200 over the execution creditor. So far as the record discloses, that question
is raised here for the first time. The report of the referee
recites that a preference for the claims, not to exceed
$600 to each claimant, was sought under ยง 64 (b) (5) of
the Bankruptcy Act. That subdivision has no relation
to claims arising under state law, and no mention of any
such claims is made in the referee's report or in the decision of either of the courts below or in the record. In
no view of the matter is the question properly before us
for consideration.
