INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v.
F. H. PEAVEY & COMPANY.
UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY v. SAME.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

Nos. 285, 286, 287.

Argued October 13, 18, 1911.-Decided November 13,
1911.

The Interstate Commerce Act does not attempt to equalize fortune,
opportunities or abilities; it contemplates payment of reasonable
compensation by carriers for services rendered, and instrumentalities
furnished, by owners of property transported, the only power of the
Commission being to determine the maximum of such compensation.
Contracts made by various railroads for elevation expenses of grain
at points of transshipment at rates not exceeding those fixed by
the Commission as reasonable, held not to be illegal discriminations'
or rebates when paid to owners of elevators on their own grain
although such owners performed services other than those paid for
at the same time to their own advantage.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Robert Dunlap and Mr. GardinerLathrop, by leave
of court, filed a brief for The Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe Railway Company.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES -delivered the opinion of the court.
These are appeals from injunctions .issued upon bills
brought by the appellees against the enforcement of two
orders made by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
176 Fed. Rep. 409. The stages by which the Commission
came to its present conclusion, against its earlier view,
will be found reported in 10 I. C. C. Rep. 309, 12 id. 85,
14 id. 315. See 14 id. 317, 510, 551. In the Circuit Court
these cases were tried upon the same evidence and they
raise the same question; but as the Peavey suit presents
that question in its initial and simplest form we will state
the facts of that case first.
The Union Pacific Railroad, after passing through a
grain country, has its eastern termini at Omaha and Kansas City, on the Missouri River. Much the greater part,
nine-tenths, more or less, of the grain gathered and carried
by the road passes beyond the termini, especially to points
farther east. During the season the Union Pacific needs
all its cars to collect the. grain, and therefore wants to
get them back as quickly as possible from the end of its
line. Furthermore, the shipments eastward are made
more profitably 'in heavier loads than can be collected
from the local stations. For these reasons the Union
Pacific sought tor prevent its own cars being carried beyond
the termini, over connecting lines, and to have the grain
shifted to other cars. To make the change it is commercially necessary to pass the grain through an elevator,
where also it is weighed, another necessary step in the
transportation. See 14 1. C. C. Rep. 317, 318. An additional consideration is that Omaha and Kansas City are
great grain markets where there are sales-largely in excess

of local needs, and this also requires the grain to pass
through elevators at these points. If the Union Pacific
could not use these instruments of transfer it could not
compete with other roads that-have through lines from
the grain fields across the Missouri River to the East.
See 14 I. C. C. Rep. 317, 327,
Acting on these motives, the railroad company in 1899
made a contract in good faith with Peavey under which
he built an elevator at Council Bluffs on the other side of
the river from Omaha. He was to receive not exceeding
1Y4 cents per hundred pounds for the first ten years,
and one cent for the next ten, for grain transferred through
his elevator. Later another elevator was brought into
the arrangement, now with Peavey & Co., a eorporation.
Peavey & Co. is a large dealer in grain and receives the
same allowance for its own grain that it receives for that
of others. It is important to remark that in no case is
any additional charge made to the shipper for the elevator service. In 1904 the Interstate Commerce Commission investigated the matter and upheld the contract,
including the allowance for Peavey & Co's own grain.
10 I. C. C. Rep. 309.
The Commission also made a report to Congress, and
after further investigation, notwithstanding the fact that
the incidental advantages to grain owners from such allowances had been made apparent, Congress passed the
act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584. By this it
was provided in § 1, amending the earlier statute, that
"the

terni 'transportation'

shall include

.

all

instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage,
irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or
implied, for the use thereof and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and, transfer in
transit, ventilation, refrigeration or icing, storage, and
handling of property transported; and it shall. be the duty
of every carrier subject to the provisions rr\ this Act to

INTERSTATE COM. COMM. v. DIFFENBAUGH. 45
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable
request therefor, and to establish ,through routes," etc.
By § 6 the carrier was required to state separately in its
schedules all terminal charges and all'privileges or facilities
granted or allowed, and by § 15 "If the owner of property
transported under this Act directly or indirectly renders
any service connected with such transportation, or furnishes any instrumentality used therein, the charge and
allowance therefor shall be no more than is just and reasonable, and the Commission may, after hearing on a
complaint, determine what is a reasonable charge as the
maximum to be paid by the carrier or carriers for the service so rendered or for the use of the instrumentalitv so
furnished." Thus Congress clearly recognized that services such as those rendered by Peavey & Co. were services
in transportation and were to be paid for notwithstanding
the possibility that some advantage might be gained as
a result. Meantime other elevators had sprung up, and
in 1906 the Union Pacific extended "the allowance made
to Peavey & Co. to all elevators in Omaha, Council Bluffs
and Kansas City.
But the Interstate Commerce Commission had begun
to change its view upon further reflection. In 1907, upon
rehearing, it cut down the allowance to Peavey & Co. to
three-quarters of a cent, estimating that to be the actual
cost, and being of opinion that to allow any profit would
be in effect to permit a rebate. 12 1. C. C.. Rep. 85. The
order made required the railroad company to desist from
paying more than three-fourths of a cent per hundred
pounds, for service rendered in the transfer or elevation
of grain at Council Bluffs or Kansas City, to any one' interested in the buying, selling or shipment -of grain at
those places, especially naming the appellees. This is one
of the orders complained of. The .chief object of complaint, however, is an order made in the following year,
on June 29, 1908. In that the Commission took the last

step and ordered the Union Pacific to desist from paying
any. allowance to Peavey & Co. on grain in which they
,have any interest that is not reshipped from their elevators within 10 days, or that has been mixed, treated,
weighed or inspected in any of their elevators at the above
named points. 14 I. C. C. Rep. 315.
- The ground on which the payment to owners of graip
finally was held to be a rebate had been considered from
the beginning and, as we have said, had been brought to
the mind of Congress. It is that when the owners of the
elevators own the grain put into them they have the opportunity to perform other services ta the grain in the way
of treatment, or cleaning, clipping, and-mixing the grain,
'which although not included under the term elevation
or paid for by the railroad, it is an advantage to them
to be able to perform at the same time. This advantage
is thought to create an undue preference and unjust discrimination. . Of course the opportunities for fraud are
adverted to, but the ground of the decision is that even
an honest payment of the bare cost of elevating grain in
transit gives an undue advantage if the elevator owner also
owns the grain. As was pointed out by the court below
the final order is confined to grain that has been treated,
weighed, inspected, or mixed.
. We agree, with the court below that this decision is
erroneous in its conception of the grounds on which under
the statute an advantage may be pronounced undue, and
in its assumption that Congress has left the matter open by
,merely permissive words. The principle as t advantages
is recognized in Penn Refining Co. v. Westrh New York
& Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 208 U. S. 208, 221. The law
does not attempt to equalize fortune, opportunities or
abilities.- On the contrary the act of Congress in terms
contemplates that if the carrier receives services from an
owner of property transported, or uses instrumentalities
-furnished by the latter, he shall pay for them. That is

INTERSTATE COM. COMM Tv. DIFFENBAUGH. 47

Opinion of the Court.

taken for granted in § 15; the only restriction being that
he shall pay no more than is reasonable, and the only
permiskive element being that the Commission may determine the maximum in case there is complaint (or now,
upon its own motion. Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 12, 30
Stat. 539, 551). As the carrier is required to furnish this
part of the transportation upon request he could not be
required to do it at his own expense, and there is nothing
to prevent his hiring the instrumentality instead of owning it. In this case there is no complaint that the rate
out of which the allowance is made is unreasonable, and
it is admitted that three-quarters of a cent barely would
pay the cost of the service rendered without any reasonable profit to Peavey & Co. for the work. See Inters'ate
Commerce Commission v. Stickney, 215 U. S.98.
In the Diffenbaugh case the order of the Commission
bore the same date, June 29, 1908, as that against Peavey
& Co. and the Union Pacific. It was directed against the
Chicago, Burlington & Quinpy. Railroad Company and
other competitors of the Union Pacific, and forbade their
paying any sum as compensation' for service rendered in
the elevation of grain at Kansas City, Missouri, and other
Missouri River points upon their fines. Competition,
which was an element in the motives of the Union Pacific,
led these other roads to make a 'imilar arrangement.
Probably, being through lines, they would not object to
the Commission's order if that to the Union Pacific could
be sustained. The opinion of Mr. Commissioner Prouty
in this case takes somewhat different ground "from that on
which the 6rders in the Peavey case are based. 14 I. C.
C. Rep. 317. See 15 id. 90, 93. See also H. Gund & Co.
v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 18 I. C. C.
Rep. 364. Especially it throws doubt upon the allowance
being properly a transfer allowance at this present day.
As the contract with Peavey & Co. purportsto be only
for grain transferred, it is not necessary-to- consider

OCTOBER TERM,. 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

222 U. S.

whether -elevation could be allowed for as practically
necessary under modern conditions even if the grain did
not go on. For the purposes of this case so much of the
order as meets the above-mentioned doubt by confining
payments to grain reshipped within ten days seems proper
enough and not open to review on the matter of fact.
But when the grain has been treated the prohibition of
an allowance is universal, and therefore the question that
we have answered is raised by the record; the question,
that is, of the powerof the Commission to prohibit such
allowances to grain owners in general terms. In this
,order it was stated expressly that the purpose of the Commission-was to prohibit and stop the payment of the elevator allowances everywhere. 14 1. C. C. Rep. 510. Ibid.
551.
The Union Pacific made the allowances in question to
elevators at its termini; it had no motive to make them
anywhere else. The competitors of the Union Pacific con6erned in the Diffenbaugh case were compelled by competition to make the same allowance at Missouri River
points, but they also make it nowhere else. The Traffic
Bureau, Merchants' Exchange of St. Louis, complained
to the Commission that the result was a discrimination
against St. Louis of 34 of a cent per 100 pounds. But the
principle of the decision is that the allowance to elevators
upon their own grain is to be stppped everywhere unless
they are prevented from using the opportunity for treating their grain. Therefore this question of preference
between cities does not need to be discussed. But, as
remarked below, the Union Pacific could not be complained of on this ground, 176 Fed. Rep. 424, and it would
be impossible to deny the same right to competing roads,
merely because as the result of the conditions one city
would gain and another lose. Louisville & Nashville R. R.
Co. v. Behlmer, 175 U. S. 648.
Although the order cutting down the allowance to

MKENNA and HUGHES, JJ., dissenting.

Peavey & Co. to the estimated cost may have been influenced by erroneous views touching the powers of the
Commission and the elements proper for consideration
'(see Southern Railway Co. v. St. Louis Hay & Grain Co.,
214 U. S. 297), we are of opinion that no sufficient redson appears for disturbing that. The Commission has decided what compensation is reasonable, and we infer that
Peavey & Co. Would be content under the circumstances
to render the service for three-quarters of a cent per hundred pounds rather than give it up.
The jurisdiction in the Diffenbaugh case was doubted,
although the Commission did not press the point as it
wishes a final decision. We are content to leave that matter on the statement of the court below. 176 Fed. Rep.

is just'that they should have a chance to be heard, althe Commission.
though not parties before
The result is that the decree of the Circuit Court must
be affirmed in its main point, but that the Commission's
order of 1907, diminishing the allowance to three-quarters
of a cent, and so much of the Peavey order of 1908 as
confines allowances to grain reshipped within ten days,
should be allowed to 9tand.Decree of Circuit Court modified and affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA, with whom concurred MR.
JUSTICE HUGHES, dissenting.

I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court.
The Commission did not hold that elevation may not
properly be furbished by a railroad- or be allowed for to
a shipper, but held that "such elevation must b charged
for at what it is reasonably worth," and without discrimination. Xnd I understand elevation' to mean '!the transfer of the grain from the car of the inbound carrier, through
an elevator to the car of the outbound carrier' within a

given period. "In such elevation," Mr. Commissioner
Harlan said, and his language I adopt, "there is nothing
either preferential or discriminatory, whether done in an
elevator operated by the carrier or in an elevator operated
for it by the owner," but "any allowance by the carrier
to the owner of an elevator on grain belonging to him that
has been weighed, inspected, cleaned, mixed or otherwise treated in the process of elevation, is unlawful. As
a facility for the convenience of the carrier free elevation
is unobjectionable, but when the owner is permitted to
and does use the elevation as a transit privilege for himself, by means of which to secure commercial advantages
on his own grain, the r-°"1+ is an unlawful preference and
discrimination."
The conclusion is not a misconstruction of the statute.
Transportation simply is the business of the railroad
company. Weighing, inspecting, cleaning and mixing,
that is, raising the quality of the grain to suit the demand
of the market, is the business of the grain dealer or others,
and the two businesses are not to be confounded, and it was
not, I think, the purpose of the statute to confound them.
The statute makes the term "transportation" include
"all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage," and it is only when the owner of property renders
services "connected with such transportation, or furnishes
any instrumentality used therein," that he may be compensated by the railroad. What goes beyond that tran-'
scends'the statute and becomes, as the Commission held,
a discrimination.
I am authorized to say that MR. JusTicE HuGHEs concurs in this dissent
