court of admiralty could not draw to itself jurisdiction
over any such claim. But that liability was incurred on
September 20, 1880, a date antecedent to the act of 1884,
which act expressly excluded liabilities which arose before
its passage. That the decision by this court was not made
until November, 1886, and that the opinion makes no
reference to the act of 1884 is of no importance, since the
act had no application.
The decree is reversed and the case remanded for further

pioceedings in accordance with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 3.

Argued October 25, 26, 1911.-Decided November 20, 1911.

Although a writ which the court has power to issue in a proper case
may have been irregularly issued, the marshal is authorized and
bpund to act thereunder if it comes into his hafids'as an apparently
valid writ.
Although the attempted delegation of authority may have been ineffectual to clothe the person signing a writ with power to do so, the
marshal is protected in executing it, if it is in the usual form and
bears the seal of the court; such an irregularity can be cured by
amendment substituting the signature of the person properly authorized.
If process in ren is apparently valid and it does not appear on the
face thereof that the libel on which it is issued discloses only a personal action for damages the marshal is protected in executing it.
A collector of the port cannot be held responsible for, detention of a
vessel because he places an inspector thereon with orders to detain
her if she attempts to sail, if at the time the vessel is validly in cus-

THE facts, which involve the validity of process of the
District Court and the power and duty of the marshal
thereunder, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison, with whom
Mr. Loing C. Christiewas on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. J. P. Kennedy Bryan for respondent:
The Laurada was illegally detained by the collector.
Section 5290, Rev. Stat., did not justify the detention. The
policy of the Government is not to make the private
citizen bear the damage caused by an unlawful act of this
nature; even if there was probable cause, or a direction of
me Secretary of the Treasury, or officer of the Government, which did not constitute due process of law, or
was not a legal justification, the Government would pay
out of its own Treasury the damage to the private citizen.

United States v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 566, 567.
The Laurada was not in the custody of the law, as the
marshal was acting under a void warrant issued in the
cause, and the court had no jurisdiction, and was himself
without any authority of law, and a trespasser equally
with the defendant, the collector of the port.
Where there is no jurisdiction or power to issue the warrant in the person issuing it, as in this case, the writ is
not voidable but void, affording no protection to the person
executing it. Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 627; as

Even if the process was amendable as to signature it was
void in rem as the court had no jurisdiction and that appears independently of the decree in the suit in which the
writ was issued. The J. R. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 11; The

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
This was an action at law in the Circuit Court for the
District of South Carolina, by a citizen of Pennsylvania
against a citizen of South Carolina, as collector of the port
of Charleston, to recover damages for the alleged unlawful
detention, from November 16 to December 5, 1895, of the
American steamship Laurada, of which the plaintiff was
the otner.
The answer admitted that the defendant, as such col-.
lector, acting under instructions from the Secretary of the
Treasury; caused the vessel "to be formally detained by
placing an inspector on board;" but alleged that the marshal for the District of South Carolina had seized the vessel
on November 15, 1895, under a monition and warrant of
arrest issued out of the District. Court for that district
upon a libel filed in that court against the vessel, her engines, etc.; that the marshal retained the custody of the
vessel, under that process, from November 15 until December 18, 1895, and that, if any damage was sustained
by the plaintiff by reason of the detention of the vessel,
it did not result from any ac of the defendant.
Upon the trial of the issue so presented the evidence,
without any conflict, established these facts.
On November 15, 1895, the marshal, acting upon the
monition and warrant of arrest soon to be mentioneq,

BRYAN v. KER.
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

seized the vessel at Charleston and detained her in his custody until December 18, following, when she was surrendered to her master upon the execution of an agreement,
with sureties, conformably to Rev. Stat., § 941, and the
11th admiralty rule. On November 16, while the vessel
was so in the custody of the marshal, the defendant, as
collector of the port, acting under directions from the Secretary of the Treasury, placed an inspector on board the
vessel and thereby assumed a qualified control over her;
but the custody of the marshal was not disturbed or questioned, or intended to -be, the defendant's purpose being
only to make sure that the vessel would be detained, according to the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury,
in the event that the custody of the marshal should be
terminated. On December 6, the Secretary of the Treasury abandoned the purpose to detain the vessel, and the
defendant thereupon withdrew the inspector, the marshal
still retaining his custody.
The monition and warrant of arrest under which the
marshal acted was issued out of the District Court upon
the libel presently to be described, and what was done by
him was in strict conformity to the command of the writ.
When: the writ. was issued -the clerk of the District Court
was fatally ill and absent from his office, and the deputy,
his son, was attending him. A second son, who was not a
deputy, was temporarily in charge of the clerk's office, with
instructions, given by the deputy, to receive and file papers,
and, if it became necessary, to sign and issue process.
Acting upon these instructions, the brother signed and is-,
sued the writ in question, doing so in such manner that
it purported to have been signed and-issued by the deputy on behalf of the clerk. The libel upon which the writ
issued purported in some respects to be one in rem, but it
plainly disclosed that the libellants were not possessed of
a maritime lien upon the vessel, her engines, etc.. but. only
of a right to damages. (See Vandewater v-. Mills,. 19 How.

82, 90.) There was, however, no suggestion of this on the
face of the writ, which was in the usual form of a monition
and warrant of arrest in a suit in rem. It ran in the name
of the President, was addressed to the marshal, commanded him to seize the vessel and to detain it until the
further order of the court, bore leste of the judge of the District Court, was sealed with the seal of the court, purported
to be signed by the deputy on behalf of the clerk, and was
transmitted from the clerk's office to the marshal's office
in the usual way.
At the conclusion of the evidence showing these facts,
the court, at the request of the defendant, directed a verdict in his favor, and entered judgment accordingly. The
judgment was subsequently reversed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, 163 Fed. Rep. 233, and the case is now here
oncertiorari. 212 U. S. 575.
As it is obvious that the verdict for the defendant was
rightly directed, if the seizure and detention of the vessel
by the marshal were justified by the writ under which he
acted, we come at once to the reasons advanced for say•ing that his acts were not so justified. They are, (1) that
the writ was not signed or issued by the clerk or his deputy, but by one who was without lawful authority, and
(2) that the case stated in the libel, upon which the writ
issued, was not cognizable as a suit in rem in admiralty,
but only as a personal action for damages.
Neither reason is sufficient. Both overlook considerations which operated with impelliing force to justify the.
acts of the marshal.
True, the purported signature of the deputy was not
his own, but was affixed by his brother under an attempted
but ineffectual -delegation of authority, and yet the writ,
in .the usual form, was issued from the office of the clerk,
bearing the seal as evidence of its authenticity. In short,
although thus irregularly issued, it came into the hands of
-the marshal as an apparently valid writ. Besides, this ir-

Opinion of the Court.

regularity did not render the writ void, but voidable
merely, for it could have been amended by substituting
the true for the purported signature of the deputy. Rev.
Stat., § 948; Texas & PacificRdilway Co. v. Kirk, I11 U. S.
486; Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535; Semmes v. United
States, 91 U. S. 21; Cotter v. Alabama G. S. RailroadCo., 61
Fed. Rep. 747; Long v. Farmers'State Bank, 147 Fed. Rep.
360; Ambler v. Leach, 15 W. Va. 677.
True, also, the case stated in the libel was not cognizable as a suit in rem in admiralty, and therefore afforded
no basis for the issuance of the warrant of arrest. But as
this did not appear on the face of the wlit, and as the court
was empowered to issue such process in a proper case, it
still must be said that the writ, as it was received by the
marshal, was apparently a valid one.
In this situation the case falls clearly within the rule,
often applied in this and other courts, which is well stated
in Cooley on Torts, 3d ed., Vol. 2, p. 883, as follows:
"The process that shall protect an officer must, to use
the customary legal expression, be fair on itsface. By this
is not meant that it shall appear to be perfectly regular, and
in all respects in accord with proper practice, aild after the
most approved form; but what is intended is, that it shall
apparently be process lawfully issued, and such as the
officer might lawfully serve. More precisely, that process may be said to be fair on its face which proceeds from
a court, magistrate, or body having authority of law to
issue process of that nature, and which is legal in form, and
on its face contains nothing to notify or fairly Apprise the
officer that it is issued without authority. When such appears to be the process, the officer is' protected in making
service, aid he is not concerned with any illegalities that
may exist back of it."

TEFFT, WELLER & CO. v. MUNSURI.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF -THE UNITED STATES
FOR PORTO RICO.
No. 22.

Argued October 30, 31, 1911.-Decided December 4, 1911.

There is no appeal to this court from an order disallowing a claim made
by the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico sitting as
the bankruptcy court.
The express provisions in § 25 of the Bankruptcy Act for the exercise
of appellate jurisdiction by implication exclude the right to exercise
jurisdiction over a subject not delegated by that or some other statute.
An order of the bankruptcy court disallowing a claim is a step in the
proceeding, and not a controversy arising in the proceeding within
the meaning of § 24a. Coder v. Arts, 213 U.-S. 234; Hewit v. Berlin
Machine Works, 194 U. S. 296.
The fact that no method of review is prescribed by the statute in certain cases does not justify this court in disregarding the statute and
assuming jurisdiction where none exists.
That this court has assumed jurisdiction in a case in which its jurisdiction passed unchallenged is not controlling in a subsequent case when
the jurisdiction is challenged. Armstrong v. Fernandez, 208 U. S.
,324, qualified and limited.
The provisions for review of judgment of the District Court of the
United States for Porto Rico in § 35 of the Act of April 12, 1900,
31 Stat. 85, c. 191, do not affect the exclusive modes of review
specifically provided for in the Bankruptcy Act.
