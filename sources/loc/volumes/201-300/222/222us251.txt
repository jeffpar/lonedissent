Union Pacific officers for contempt.
We are, therefore, of opinion that the decree admitted
appellee to the use of the "main and passing tracks" of
the Union Pacific Company from. their eastern terminus
at Council Bluffs, -only to a physical connection with the

roads and at the places mentioned therein, including the
bridge over which the tracks extend across the Missouri
river between Council Bluffs and Omaha. And that
such use was all that was necessary to constitute the road's
continuous lines from east to west or from west to east.

order of the Circuit Court adjudging the appellants
guilty of contempt of the decree entered August 12, 1903,

ALUMINUM COMPANY OF AMERICA v. RAMSEY.
ERROR TO THE STPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.

No. 56.

Submitted November 8, 1911.-Decided December 11, 1911.

Although a statute increasing the liability of corporations may, as to
corporations of the State, be an exercise of the reserved power to
alter, amend and repeal, the application of that principle as to
foreign' corporations depends on many considerations and involves
Federal questions.
Whether or not a classification merely between all corporations and
partnerships and individuals offends the equal protection clause, a
classification of corporations operating railroads and individuals
does not offend that provision of the Constitution.
*One within a distinct class which is properly subject to classification

ground that it is too broad and includes others outside of that
class.
Although the state court may have applied the statute to plaintiff in
error merely as a corpbration, if the record shows that it is a corporation of a kind properly classified by the statute and thereis equality
within that class, the statute will not be held invalid as repugnant
to the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
89 Arkansas, 522, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality, under the
Fourteenth Amendment, of the Arkansas Fellow Servant
Law, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. U. M. Rose, Mr. G. B. Rose, Mr. W. E. Hemingway
and Mr. J. F. Loughborough for plaintiff in error:
The act of 1907 is unconstitutional because it denies to
plaintiff in error the equal protection of the law and deprives it of its property without due process of law.
It imposes obligations upon corporations without regard
to the class of business in which they are engaged and in
a matter where the classification of corporations is not
authorized because of the nabure of their entity.
Corporations are persons within the Fourteenth Amendment and are entitled to all of its protections. Gulf,

The hazard incurred by the defendant in error was a
risk of railroading as to which the legislature might make
a special rule. Minnesota Iron Co. v. Kline, 199 U. S. 593.
MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of, the

court.
The defendant in error brought this action against the
plaintiff in error in the Saline Circuit Court of the State of
Arkansas to recover for personal injuries alleged to have
been received by him while in the employment of the
company, which maintained a railroad to its mines, on
account of the negligence of a fellow servant.
The action was based upon a statute of the State called
by the parties "The Fellow Servant Law." (Acts 1907,
Act 69, p. 162.) The statute makes railroad corporations
operating within the State and every company, whether
incorporated or not, engaged in the mining of coal, "liable
to respond in damages for injuries or death sustained"
by agents, employgs or servants, "resulting from the
careless omission of duty or negligence of such employer,"
or "any other agent, servant or employ6 of the said employer," in the same manner as though the carelessness,
omission of duty or negligence was that of the employer.
The company assailed the constitutionality of the statute by the request for the following instruction, which was
refused by the trial court: "You are instructed that the
act of the legislature, approved March 8th, 1907, knoWn
as 'The Fellow Servant Law,' in providing it shall apply to
all corporations but shall not apply to individuals, persons
or partnerships, except those engaged in the operation of
a railroad or coal mine, denies to this defendant the equal
protection of the law, and is in Violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."

ALUMINUM CO. v. RAMSEY.
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

There was a verdict for the plaintiff, defendant in error
here, upon which judgment was duly entered. It was sustained by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 89 Arkansas,
522.
The Supreme Court sustained the action of the trial
court in refusing the instruction on the authority of Ozan
Lumber Co. v. Biddie, which had been previously decided,
and which is reported in 87 Arkansas, 587. This action
of the court is assigned as error, and is the Federal question
relied on.
A motion is made to dismiss, and, alternately, to affirm,
respectively, on the ground that there is no Federal question in the state court's construction of the statute, and
that if there be such a question it is foreclosed by repeated
decisions of this court. In support of the motion to dismiss it is contended that the state court decided that the
act assailed is an ainendment to the charter of the corporation under the reserved right to amend, alter or repeal
the charter, and of this the corporation cannot complain,
the exertion of such right being a condition of its existence.
In Ozan Lumber Co. v. Biddie, supra, the court decided
that "The Fellow Servant Law" was an amendment to
the charters of cdrporations, made under the right reserved in the constitution of the State to repeal, alter or
amend such charters. The Ozan Lumber Company,
however, was a domestic corporation, and whether the
principle of the decision would be applicable to foreign
corporations, as plaintiff in error in the case at bar is,.
being a Pennsylvania corporation, depends on many considerations, and involves questions not local; so we pass
to the consideration of the merits.
On the merits the case is in a very narrow compass and
does not demand much discussion, though plaintiff in
error earnestly presses the contention that the statute
is discriminatory in that it applies to all corporations, but
does not apply to individuals or partnerships. Whether

222 U. S.

that exact distinction, that is, the distinction merely between corporations and partnerships and individuals, is
competent for a legislature to make, under its power
of classifying objects, we are not called upon to- decide.
The distinction made by the statute is broader. The distinction (among. others) it makes is between railroads
operating in the State and individuals, and such distinction has been maintained by this court as not offending the
Constitution of the United States. Tullis v. Lake Erie &
Western R. R. Co., 175 U. S. 348; Minnesota Iion Co. v.
Kline, 199 U. S.593. See also Employers' Liability Cases,
207 U. S.463, 504, and El Paso &c. Ry. Co. v. Gutierrez,
215U. S.87.
What grievance plaintiff in error might have if it were
not operating a railroad we are not called upon to consider,
because it is limited in its complaint to the effect of the
statute on it and cannot appropriate the grievance that
corporations engaged in mining, but not operating railroads, may have on account of the distinction made between them and individuals.
It is true that the Supreme Court of the State, following
Ozan Lumber Co. v. Biddie, supra, decided the law was a
regulation of corporations, and applied it to the plaintiff
in error because it was a corporation,, not distinguishing
it as one operating a railroad. It, however, may be so
distinguished under the statute. That is, the statute constitutes a class of corporations operating railroads, and
under the cases we have cited the classification is valid,
there being equality within the class. In other words,
not only the plaintiff in error, but all other corporations
operating railroads are covered by the statute.
We think, therefore, that the statute of Arkansas is not
repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. and the judgment is
Affirmed.
