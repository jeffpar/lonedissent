BLINN, RECEIVER OF ALLEN, AN ABSENTEE,
v. NELSON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 5.

Argued April 10, 1911.-Decided October 23, 1911.

A state statute of limitations allowing only a little more than a year
for the institution of a suit to recover his personal property by a
party who has not been hearL from for fourteen years and for whose
property a receiver has been appointed is not unconstitutional as
depriving him of his property without due process of law; and so
held as to the provisions to that effect of the Revised Laws of Massachusetts, c. 144, for distribution of estates of persons not heard
of for fourteen years and presumably dead.
Constitutional law, like other mortal contrivances, has to take qome
chances of occasionally inflicting injustice in extraordinary cases.
197 Massachusetts, 279, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

for receivership and care of property of an absentee under Cunnius v. Reading School- District, 198 U. S. 458, it
is unconstitutional as to the provisions barring the absentee from recovering property after the expiration of
fourteen years from the disappearance; the provisions as
to the disposition of such property are unconstitutional,
in ,that the notice which is required as the prerequisite
to the proceedings is inadequate; the safeguards affecting the rights of the absentee in the distribution
of the property are inadequate; and the time within
which distribution may be made is arbitrary and unreasonable.
The statute; which is the subject of construction in this
case, is different in many essentials from the Pennsylvania statute sustained in Cunnius v. Reading School District, supra.
A minimum constructive notice of thirty days is all
that is required by the Massachusetts statute-only onefifth as long as the notice required by the Pennsylvania
statute.
The rights, of absentees ar not properly safeguarded
'by the Massachusetts statute in case of a distribution.
They are absolutely barred at the expiration of fourteen
years from the date of disappearance or at the expiration
of one year after the appointment of a receiver in the event
that such appointment is made more than thirteen years
after the date of disappearance. The Pennsylvania statute leaves a discretion with the court which may carefully
protect the rights of the absentee regardless of length of
absence.
The Massachusetts statute can only be defended as a
statute of limitations, and if the time within which the
statute is to take effect is unreasonably short, it is unconstitutional. The consideration of what constitutes a
reasonable or unreasonable length of time for such a statute to operate depends upon the circumstances of the class

BLINN v. NELSON.

of cases which it affects. The time which is reasonable for
one class of cases may be unreasonable for another class
of cases and all classes of cases may be affected in times
of a public emergency, Am. Land Co. v. Zeis , 219 U. S.
47; Wilson v. Iseminger, i85 U. S. 55; in that eVent it
would not be a statute of limitations but an unlawful attempt to arbitrarily extinguish rights. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 207; In re Brown, 135 U. S. 701,
707.
The time within which distribution may be made is
arbitrary and unreasonable. That portion of the statute
which provides for the distribution of the property of an
absentee is unconstitutional and void, because it operates
as a statute of limitations, the timae of which is unreasonably short and is measired by the wrong standard,
to wit: the duration of the absence instead of the duration
of the abandonmer of the property to be distributed.
9 of the statute
Although that pa-.
providing for final
distribution of the prc erty is void, the provisions for
appointment of the receiver anq care and management of
the property, etc., are valid. These two parts are entirely distinct and separable, and in no way dependent
upon each other. Each pAr might well have been enacted
alone without any provision for distribution. Commonwealth v. 'Hithings, 5 Gray, 482, 485; Commonwealthv. Petranich; 183 Massachusetts, 217, 220; Edwards v.
Bruorton, 185 Massachusetts, 529, 530; Commonwealth v.

sachusetts, 279; Attorney General v. Provident Institution,
201 Massachusetts, 23.
The provisions of the statute'as to final distribution
after fourteen years are also constitutional.
The only material difference between the Pennsylvania
statute and the Massachusetts statute is that the former
seems to leave the matter of final distribution to the discretion of the .court and provides for security for its repayment unless the court decrees its ultimate distribution to
the persons entitled thereto, while the latter statute provides that the property shall never be repaid after the
expiration of fourteen years and creates a new statute of
limitations.
It is within the power of a State to enact reasonable
statutes of limitations and estbablish a time after which
no action can be brought. Th~s power is legislative and
not judicial. Am. Land Co. V. Zeiss, 219 U. S. 47, 70;
Kentucky Union Co. v. Kentucky, 219 U. S. 156; Missouri v.,TIllinois, 200 U. S. 496; Davis v. Mills, 194 U. S.

Maine, 268; Tioga Railroad v. Blossburg & Corning Railroad, 20 Wall. 137, 150; Metcalf v. Watertown, 153 U. S.
671. For specific instances, see McElmoyle v. Cohen, 13
Pet. 312, .327 (five years allowed); Wheeler v. Jackson,
137 U. S.245 (six months allowed); Turner v. New York,
168 U. S. 90, aff'g 145 N. Y. 451 (six months allowed).
See also SaranacLand k Timber Co. v. New York, 177 U. S.

seven days allowed); Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280 (two
years allowed); Sohn v. Waterson, 17 Wall. 596 (two years
allowed); Hawkins v. Barney, 5 Pet. 456, holding Kentucky's Seven Years' Possession Law valid.
Local conditions must govern.
The fact that there imay be a distribution one year
after the appointment of a receiver is not unreasonable,
especially when taken in connection with the absence of

BLINN v. NELSON.

Opinion of the Court.

the party for over fourteen years; nor is it unreasonable
to provide that the time shall be reckoned from the date of
the disappearance rather than from the date of the right
of the absentee to possession of any property in question.
That has always been the rule in case of presumption of
death after seven years' absence and important rights
are determined by it. Loring v. Steineman, 1 Met. 204;
George v. Clark, 186 Massachusetts, 426; Butrick v. Tilton,
155 Massachusetts, 461; Marden v. Boston, 155 Massachusetts, 359; Stockbridge, Pet'r, 145 Massachusetts, 517;
Bowditch v. Jordan,131 Massachusetts, 321; Kelly v. Drew,
12 Allen, 107; King v. Fowler, 11 Pick. 302. Any statute
of limitations which may have run while the owner is
ignorant of his rights may work hardship but that is the
penalty for absence without leaving an address, notifying
friends or appointing an agent. Hurling v. Caw Valley
Railway, 130 U. S. 559.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a petition by the next of kin of an absentee for
the distribution of her property in the hands of the receiver; the appointment of the receiver, the taking of the
property into his hands, and the piesent petition all being
under Massachusetts Revised Laws, c. 144, and amendments to the same. The general scheme of the law is that
in case of a person disappearing from Massachusetts to
parts unknown, leaving no known agent in the State,
but having an interest in property there, any one who
would be entitled to administration may apply to the Probate Court for the appointment of the receiver. After due
notice, a warrant to the sheriff to take possession of the
property, and his return, a receiver- may be appointed of
the property scheduled in the sheriff's return, and the court
is to find and record the date of the disappearance. By
§,10, if theabsentee does not appear and claim the property

within fourteen years after the recorded date, his title is
barred; and by § 11 if, after the fourteen years, the property has not been accounted for or paid over, it is to be distributed to those who would have taken it on the day fourteen years after the said date. By § 12 if the receiver is not
appointed within thirteen years after said date, the time
for distribution and for barring actions relative to the
property shall be one year after the date of the appointment instead of the fourteen years provided in §§ 11, 12.
On July 20, 1905, the plaintiff in error was appointed
receiver of the property of Mabel E. Allen, and the date
of the disappearanc.e of the latter was found and recorded
as 'within or prior to the year 1892.' The present petition
was filed on March 18, 1907. The property in question
was an interest of the absentee under the residuary clause
of the will of Jonathan Merry, allowed and proved on
December 8, 1828. Long after the estate was settled
an administrator de bonis non was appointed in 1885 and
in or about 1899 collected on account of French Spoliation
Claims a sum in which Mabel Allen's share was $1633
and $22. This, with accumulations from interest, is the
fund in controversy. The Probate Court made a decree
of distribution, which was affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth. 197 Massachusetts,
.279. The receiver, having duly set up that the above
rnentioned §§ 10, 11' and 12 were contrary to the Four'teerita Amendment, brought the case to this court.
The plaintiff in error does not deny that the provisions
Ior the appointment of a receiver are valid. Cunnius v.
Reading School District, 198 U. S. 458. But he argues that
the attempt to bar the absentee's title and to :distribute
his property is Void for want of sufficient notice and other
safeguards and because he time within which distribution may be made is arbitrary and unreasonable.- There
is reasonably careful provision for notice by publication
before the appointment and the whole proceeding begins

Opinion of the Court.

with a seizure by the sheriff of the property mentioned in
the original petition. American Land Co.. v. Zeiss, 219
*U. S. 47, 67. Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration,
175 Massachusetts, 71, 75. So the question pt in the
way most favorable for the plaintiff in error is whether a
statute of limitations that possibly may allow little more
than one year, istoo sbort when the property is held in'
the quasi adverse hand of the receiver for that time, (what
the court would do and how it would interpret the statute if other property feli in after the receiver was appointed is not material in this case). We cannot doubt
as to the answer. If the legislature thinks that a year is
long enough to allow a party to recover his property from
a third hand, and establishes that time in cases where
he has not been heard of for fourteen years and presumably is dead, it acts within its constitutional discreti6n.
Now and then an extraordinary case may turn up, but
constitutional law like other mortal contrivances has to
take some chances, and in the great majority of instances
no doubt justice will be done. See American Land Co. v.
Zeiss, 219 U. S. 47, 67. Shorter time than one year has
been upheld. Kentucky Union Co. v. Kentucky, 219 U. S.
140, 156. Turner v. New York, 168 U. S. 90. Terry v.
Anderson, 95 U. S. 628. See Sopier v. Lawrence Brothers
Company, 201 U. S. 359, 369.
