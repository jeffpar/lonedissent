McMICKING v. SCHIELDS.

Argument for Appellant.

McMICKING v. SCHIELDS.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF- THE PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS.
No. 285.

Submitted May 12, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.

General Order No. 58, of April 23, 1900, amended the Philippine Code
of Criminal Procedure, and gave the person charged with crime a
specified time within which to-plead; but even if the trial court misconstrued the provisions of the Order in that respect, such error
would not deprive the proceedings of lawful effect and enlarge the
accused.
Mere error of law, even though serious, committed by the trial court
in a criminal case in the exercise of jurisdiction over a case properly
subject to its cognizance, cannot be reviewed by habeas corpus.
The writ of habeas corpus cannot be employed as a substitute for a
writ of error.
23 P. I. 526, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a conviction

and sentence in the Philippine Islands and the extent to
which the conviction -can be- reviewed on habeas corpus,
are stated in the opinion.
Mt. S. T. Ansell for appellant:
This court has jurisdiction of this appeal.
The Supreme Court discussed and decided the cause
and released the prisoner upon a misapprehension and an
unwarranted assumption as to what took place in the trial
court.
The record shows that appellee enjoyed all the time allowed under the Philippine practice.
The judgment of conviction was not void; it was at
most only voidable for error or irregularity of procedure.
The trial court had and retained complete jurisdiction.
It had jurisdiction to decide, as a question of law arising

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Appellant.

in the course of the trial, the question of the applicability
of § 30.
Denial of time for preparation prescribed by § 30 is not
a violation of the due process of law provisions of the
Organic Act nor is § 30 a due process of law standard.
Non-compliance with such statutes does not violate the
due process of law provisions and render the trial void.
The requirements of due process of law were fully met
in the trial court.
Habeas corpus was not the proper remedy, and the
Supreme Court not only abused the writ but violated its
own jurisdictional power.
The proceeding complained of in the trial court being
at most only erroneous or irregular habeas corpus was not
the proper remedy.
Incomparably more serious defects than the one complained of are not remediable by habeas corpus.
The Supreme Court violated its own jurisdiction under
Philippine law in allowing the writ.
Appellee's remedy under local law was by certiorari.
If mere procedural error is to be remedied through
habeas corpus, as was attempted in this cause, the whole
course of criminal justice in the Philippine Islands may be
deranged, or even defeated.

and the Director of Prisons has appealed. The controversy fairly involves the application of § 5, Organic
Act of the Islands (Act of Congress, July 1, 1902, c. 1369,
32 Stat. 691, 692, 695); and under § 10 of that statute
we have jurisdiction of the appeal. Fisher v. Baker,
203 U. S. 174; Paraisov. United States, 207 U. S. 368.
Appellee, Schields, presented a petition to the Supreme
Court January 4, 1911, wherein, after setting out his
alleged wrongful imprisonment under a j.udgment entered
in the Court of First Instance, City of Manila, he further
alleged and prayed: "That said imprisonment and deprivation of his liberty are illegal, because the said Court
of First Instance denied him the due process of law
guaranteed by the Philippine Bill of Rights. The said
illegalities are as follows: That on December 21, 1910, the
petitioner appealed from a judgment of the lower court
sentencing him for the crime of theft. That on December 23, the petitioner, without having been asked to
answer the complaint, was notified that the case would be
heard at 10 a. m. on December 24. When the case was
called at 10 a. m. on December 24, and while the petitioner
was arraigned, he asked for time in which to answer, the
complaint, which request was denied by the court, who
ordered the Clerk to enter on the record that the petitioner
pleaded 'Not Guilty' to the complaint. Thereupon the
petitioner's attorney also asked for time in which to prepare a defense, which petition was also denied by the same
court, to which ruling the petitioner's attorney excepted
and asked that the exception, together with the requests of
the petitioner which had been denied, be entered on the
record. Wherefore, the petitioner prays the Honorable
Supreme Court to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus in his
favor, reversing the judgment pronounced by the lower
court as being contrary to law, and that the petitioner be
set at liberty."
Responding to a rule to show cause why the writ should

not issue, appellant answered that by virtue of an order
of the Court of First Instance petitioner was in his custody
in Bilibid Prison to serve a sentence of four months and
one day of arresto mayor imposed upon conviction of
theft. Copies of the commitment and judgment were
made parts of the return. In course of that judgment
the judge said: "At the beginning of the trial the defendant asked for further time to prepare, and invoked
certain sections of G. 0. 58, which, in our judgment, were
not applicable to this case. The prosecution did not file
a new complaint in this court. Defendant was tried on the
identical complaint which was presented in the court
below as long ago as December first. To that complaint,
as the record shows, he pleaded not guilty and having
further brought this case here on appeal the presumption
is that such plea continued and to allow delays for the
reiteration of such a plea would be an empty formality.
The law does not require a vain and useless thing and the
provision in question must be construed as applying to
cases where a new complaint is filed in this court. But
aside from this we think that the time of trial caused no
prejudice to the accused. As we have seen, the complaint
was filed on December first, and the accused had more than
three weeks to prepare before the trial in this court.
During this period there were evidently one or more continuances and finally it seems the defendant had to be
called into the Municipal Court by a bench warrant.
Upon bringing the case here it was incumbent upon him
to follow it up and to be ready and waiting its disposition
by this court. Notice of the trial was sent both to him
and to his counsel the day before and it was not claimed
that defendant could have produced any further testimony if the case had been postponed. On the contrary,
it appears that he called one witness who did not testify
in the court below. After all the question in the case is
mainly one of law. The principal controversy as to the

facts relates to the question of the alleged permission to
take the articles, and this, as we have seen would not have
excused the defendant, even had it been proved, though
he admits that himself and Frandon are the only witnesses
on that point."
General Order No. 58, promulgated from the Office of
the United States Military Governor April 23, 1900, and
now in effect, amended the Code of Criminal Procedure
theretofore in force within the Islands. Kepner v. United
States, 195 U. S. 100, 111. It provides: "Sec. 19. If, on
the arraignment, the defendant requires it, he must be
allowed a reasonable time, not less than one day, to answer
the complaint or information. He may, in his answer to
the arraignment, demur or plead to the complaint or information.
Sec. 30. After his plea the defendant shall be entitled, on demand, to at least two days
in which to prepare for trial."
Section 528 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by
the Philippine Commission August 7, 1901, provides:
"If it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of
his liberty is in custody of an officer under process issued
by a court or magistrate, or by virtue of a judgment or
order of a court of record, and that the court or magistrate had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed; or
if the jurisdiction appear after the writ is allowed, the
person shall not be discharged by reason of any informality
or defect in the process, judgment, or order."
The pertinent part of § 5 of the Organic Act, approved
July 1, 1902-" The Philippine Bill of Rights "-is as
follows:" That no law shall be enacted in said islands which
shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person therein
the equal protection of the laws. That in all criminal
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be heard
by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and cause of

Opinion of the Court.

the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public
trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses
in his behalf."
Kepner v. United States, supra,
117, 118.
The Supreme Court having heard the cause upon petition and reply held-one judge. dissenting-that the writ
of habeas corpus should be allowed and discharged the
prisoner. Among other things it declared: "The denial
to the accused of the time, at least two days, to prepare
for trial, expressly given to him by mandatory statute,
there being absolutely no discretion lodged in the court
concerning the matter, is in effect the deprivation of the
constitutional right of due process of law, to a trial before
condemnationrsaid statute being for the purpose of making practically effective in benefit of the accused said constitutional provision. . . . The denial to the accused
of a constitutional right does one of two things, it either
ousts the court of jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction, or it deprives the record of all legal virtue, and a
judgment of conviction entered thereon is a nullity, it
having nothing to support it. . . . He applied for a
writ of habeas corpus upon the ground that the judgment
was void as a matter of law as he had been convicted without due process of law. . . . The refusal of the time
in which to prepare for trial and the consequent forcing
of the defendant to his defense on the instant is, under
the provisions of our law, equivalent, in our judgment, to
the refusal of a legal hearing. It amounts in effect to a
denial of a trial. It is an abrogation of that due process of
law which is the country's embodied procedure, without
which a defendant has, in law, no trial at all. . . . Nobody has denied the initial jurisdiction of the trial court:
It has never been discussed or even questioned in this
court. That jurisdiction has always been freely conceded.
The decision of this court rested upon something which

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

occurred after the jurisdiction referred to had attached
and after the trial had begun. It rested upon the proposition that, while the trial court had jurisdiction in the
first place, it either lost that jurisdiction during the progress of the trial, or so transcended its powers as to render
its judgment void."
We are unable to agree with the conclusion of the Supreme Court that the judgment pronounced by the Court
of First Instance was void and without effect. Under the
circumstances disclosed denial of the request for time to
answer and to prepare defense was at most matter of
error which did not vitiate the entire proceedings. The
cause-admitted to be within the jurisdiction of the
court--stood for trial on appeal. .The accused had known
for weeks the nature of the charge against him. He had
notice of the hearing, was present in person and represented by counsel, testified in his own behalf, introduced
other evidence, and seems to have received an impartial
hearing. There is nothing to show that he needed further
time for any proper purpose, and there is no allegation
that. he desired to offer additional evidence or suffered
substantial injury by being forced into trial. But for the
sections in respect of procedure quoted from General
Order No. 58 it could not plausibly be contended that the
conviction was without due process of law. The Court of
First Instance placed no purely fanciful or arbitrary construction upon these sections and certainly they are not
so peculiarly inviolable that a mere misunderstanding of
their meaning or harmless departure from their exact
terms would suffice to deprive the proceedings of lawful
effect and enlarge the accused. Ex parte Harding, 120

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

No. 222.

Argued April 14, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.

The rule that, in the absence of diversity of citizenship, jurisdiction of
the District Court over a suit depends upon whether there is a
Federal cause of action stated in the bill applies to suits against
national banks and their directors.
Under the act of August 13, 1888, the Federal courts have not, in the
absence of diverse citizenship, jurisdiction of a suit by a stockholder
against directors of a national bank and the bank to compel the
directors to reimburse the bank for wrongfully investing its funds,
nor has the District Court any jurisdiction of such a suit under
paragraph 16 of § 24, Judicial Code.
