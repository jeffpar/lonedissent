to enquire into the local practice. The constitutional
claim sustained in Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co., 262
U. S. 312, was not that under the Fourteenth Amendment
as in Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., 260 U. S.
516. It was assumed that the carrier had been found
within the State. The judgment was reversed on the
ground that to compel it to try the cause there would burden interstate commerce and, hence, would violate the
commerce clause. No local rule of practice can prevent
the carrier from laying the appropriate foundation for the
enforcement of its constitutional right by making a seasonable motion. Compare Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, 235
U. S. 197; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. v. Mullins,
249 U. S. 531; Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22, 24.
Reversed.

WESTERN & ATLANTIC R. R. v. HUGHES. 497
Opinion of the Court.

496

Mr. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Ira L. Hughes, a travelling fireman, was killed on the
Western & Atlantic Railroad while engaged in the performance of his duties. His widow as administratrix
brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability
Act in a state court of Georgia. She recovered a verdict
of $17,500, which was set aside as excessive by the presiding judge. At the second trial before another judge and
jury a verdict was rendered for $10,000. A motion for
a new trial was overruled. Judgment was entered on this
verdict; and it was affirmed by the intermediate appellate
court. The Supreme Court of the State refused a certiorari. This Court granted the writ. 278 U. S.588.
Hughes was killed while riding on a locomotive moving
in interstate commerce. The plaintiff claimed that he was
knocked from the running board and thrown against an
upright on a bridge as the train entered it; that the accident resulted from an unusual rocking of the engine from
side to side due to the defective condition of the track
leading to the bridge; that the Railroad had been negligent in permitting the track to remain in bad condition;
and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the
injury. The Railroad claimed that the alleged cause of
the accident was mere speculation. It denied that the
track was in bad condition; denied that its condition had
produced the alleged swaying. of the locomotive; denied
that it had been guilty of any negligence; insisted that
the accident was the result of Hughes' gross negligence
and his disobedience of the company's rules; claimed that
he had assumed the risk; and requested a directed verdict.
The request was denied.
The Railroad asserts that the scintilla of evidence rule
prevails in Georgia; and argues that the lower courts
erred by applying the local rule in this case. It is true

Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

that submission to the jury of contested issues of fact is
not required in the federal courts, if there is only a
scintilla of evidence, Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v.
Groeger, 266 U. S. 521, 524; that it is the duty of the
judge to direct the verdict, when the testimony and all
inferences which the jury could justifiably draw therefrom
would be insufficient to support a verdict for the other
party, Elliott v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry., 150
U. S. 245; Small Co. v. Lamborn & Co., 267 U. S. 248,
254; and that this federal rule must be applied by state
courts in cases arising under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act, Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v.
Coogan, 271 U. S. 472, 474; Gulf, Mobile & Northern R. R.
v. Wells, 275 U. S. 455, 457; Toledo, St. Louis & Western
R. R. v. Allen, 276 U. S. 165, 168. We need, not consider
whether the rule prevailing in Georgia differs substantially from the federal rule.1 For even under the federal
rule it was proper to submit the case to the jury. The
evidence introduced by the plaintiff was substantial; and
was sufficient, if believed, to sustain a verdict in her
favor. There was much conflict in the evidence. The
first trial occupied five days. At the second trial thirtythree witnesses testified. Some of the testimony given by
witnesses for the Railroad would, if believed, have entitled
it to the verdict as a matter of law. Some of the testimony given by witnesses called by the plaintiff does not
seem to us persuasive. But the credibility of the witnesses
and the weight of the evidence were obviously mattbrs
for the jury. The defendant was not entitled to a directed
verdict.

Syllabus.

The Railroad contends also that there was error in
assessing the damages. It argues that nominal damages
only were recoverable since the plaintiff failed to introduce
evidence either as to the proper method of computing the
present value of the anticipated benefits or as to the rate
of interest which should be applied in doing so. The
evidence was ample. Among other things, there were
mortality tables introduced by the plaintiff and annuity
tables offered by the Railroad-tables in which values
were computed at both the six per cent and the seven per
cent rate. The Railroad argues also that the charge failed
to make it clear to the jury that, in computing the damages recoverable for the deprivation of future benefits,
adequate allowance must be made, according to circumstances, for the earning power of money; that the verdict
should be for the present value of the anticipated benefits;
and that the legal rate of interest is not necessarily the
rate to be applied in making the computation. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Kelly, 241 U. S. 485, 491; Gulf,
Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Moser, 275 U. S. 133. There
is no room for a contention that the charge failed to state
correctly the applicable rule. If more detailed instruction
was desired, it was incumbent upon the Railroad to make
a request therefor. Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. followay, 246 U. S. 525. It did not do so.
Affirmed.
