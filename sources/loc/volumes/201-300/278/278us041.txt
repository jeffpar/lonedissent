situation, we too often overlook the fundamental reasons
for the creation or evolution of the court. It received no
grant of express powers nor were express duties imposed
upon it. The law courts were left to deal with the violation of all rights for which they could give an adequate
remedy. The duty of relieving against any remaining
wrongs was imposed upon the court of chancery."
We are of opinion that the infirmity in the Pennsylvania
statute which was pointed out in Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben
Avon Borough is not present in the New Jersey statutes.

MR. JUSTICE McRYNOLDS is of opinion that the action
of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners was unreasonable and arbitrary and should be set aside. To permit
the Commissioners to impose a charge of $100,000 upon
the Railroad under the pretense of objection to a six per
cent. curve in a country road is to uphold what he regards as plain abuse of power.

October 18,

1. A special act empowering the District Court to determine a case
arising from a collision between a warship and a private craft, and
to decree for "the amount of the legal damages sustained by
reason of said collision . . . upon the same principles and measure
of liability with costs as in like cases in admiralty between private

parties," should not be construed to allow interest in a recovery
against the United States although interest is commonly'included
in collision cases where the Government is not a party. P. 46.

2. This and similar acts, considered with general legislation in pari
materia, in the light of the rule exempting the United States from
interest, shows a policy of Congress to distinguish between the
damages caused by a collision and the later loss caused by delay
in paying them. P. 47.
3. The fact that if the United States had prevailed in the suit it
could have claimed interest, does not signify that the statute
accords a similar right to the private party, since the right of the
United States to recover interest is independent of the statute.

CERTIORARI, 275 U. S. 519, to a decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, refusing to allow interest against the
United States in a collision case litigated under a Special
Act of Congress. The District Court had ordered the
damages divided, 7 F. (2d) 278, and the petitioner sought
interest on its share.

There undoubtedly are rare cases which recognize that
there is an element of discretion in the allowance of interest in collision cases. Examples are The Scotland, 118
U. S. 507; The Albert Dumois, 177 U. S. 240; The Maggie
J. Smith, 123 U. S. 349. But this discretion has so uniformly been exercised to allow interest that its allowance
has become practically a rule of law in the absence of a
showing of some extraordinary circumstance making it
inequitable to allow it. But two circumstances-are recognized as justifying the refusal of interest-laches in bringing suit, and vexatious appeals. Benedict on Admiralty,
5th ed., p. 495; Roscoe, op. cit., p. 41.
Admiralty Courts continually refer to the allowance of
interest as the usual rule. In re Great Lakes Dredge &

extreme cases to deny interest, then the rule of that case
cannot logically be applied to any tort case; for under the
decisions of this Court, the jury in non-maritime tort
cases is possessed of the same discretion. Lincoln v. Claflin, 7 Wall. 132; District of Columbia v. Robinson, 180
U. S.92; Drumm-Floto Co. v. Edmisson, 208 U. S. 534.
Doubt is resolved by the explicit provision that the
"legal damages" shall be awarded "upon the same principle and measure of liability with costs in like cases between private parties." 1 Op. A. G. 268; United States
v. McKee, 91 U. S. 442.
The provision in the present act for costs to the successful party still further fortifies the conclusion that full
restitution was intended.
Out of ninety-six special acts passed since 1912 when
they began to appear commonly, comparable in phraseology to that here in question, four include interest eo
nomine. Eight explicitly exclude it and eighty-four make
no mention of it eo nomine. It is easy for Congress to say
so, if it is its intention to exclude it. Tiger v. Western
Investment Co., 221 U. S.286. In other cages the merits
have been considered, damages determined by the Committee and a stated sum has been reported out and voted
by Congress directly as relief, sometimes with interest.
The Suits in Admiralty Act provides for interest at 4%-by judicial construction, from the date of the collision.
Middleton v. United States, 286 Fed. 548. But in Comus
v. Lake Frampton, 1927 A. M. C. 1713, a libel brought
under this Act, an owner was allowed by the Circuit Court

of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 6% interest against
the United States under the court's broad equity power
because the Government in a cross-libel was recovering
under the usual rule 6% per annum as a part of its own

damages.
It must be clear that what Congress has done in one
case is no guide to what it intends in another. The fact

is there is no ambiguity in the present case in the Act
itself if the judicially settled meanings of the words used
are given effect.
The weight of authority, dealing with similar statutes,
supports the petitioner and not the Government. The

herein are Pennell v. United States, 162 Fed. 75, and Nantasket Beach S. S. Co. v. United States, 297 Fed. 656.

328; The Barendrecht, 11 F. (2d) 377.
Assistant Attorney General Farnum, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. John T. Fowler, Jr., were on
the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a libel in admiralty brought by the petitioner to
recover for damages done to its steam lighter Corneliaby
a collision with the United States destroyer Bell. It is
brought against the United States by authority of a special Act of May 15, 1922, c. 192, 42 Stat. 1590. There
has been a trial in which both vessels ultimately were
found to have been in fault and it was ordered that the
damages should be divided. 7 F. (2d) 278. Thereafter
the damages were ascertained and the petitioner sought
to be allowed interest upon its share. (There was no
cross libel.) The Circuit Court of Appeals, going on the
words of the statute, parallel legislation, and the general
understanding with regard to the United States, held that
no interest could be allowed. 19 F. (2d) 744. As there
was a conflict of opinion with the Second Circuit dealing
with similar language in a special act, New York & Cuba
Mail S. S. Co. v. United States, 16 F. (2d) 945, a writ
of certiorari was allowed by this Court, 275 U. S. 519.
The material words of the Act are that the District
Court "shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the
whole controversy and to enter a judgment or decree for
the amount of the legal damages sustained by reason of
said collision, if any shall be found to be due either for
or against the United States, upon the same principle and
measure of liability with costs as in like cases in admiralty
between private parties with the same rights of appeal."
On a hasty reading one might be led to believe that Con-

Opinion of the Court.

gress had put the United States on the footing of a private person in all respects. But we are of opinion that a
scrutiny leads to a different result. It is at least possible
that the words fixing the extent of the Government's liability were carefully chosen, and we are of opinion that
they were. We start with the rule that the United States
is not liable to interest except where it assumes the liability by contract or by the express words of a statute,
or must pay it as part of the just compensation required
by the Constitution. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v.
United States, 261 U. S. 299, 304, 306. Next we notice
that when this special act was passed there was a recent
general statute on the books, the Act of March 9, 1920,
c. 95, § 3, 41 Stat. 525, 526, allowing suits in admirality
to be brought in personam against the United States, in
which it was set forth specifically that interest was to be
allowed upon money judgments and the rate was four per
centum, not the six per centum that the petitioner expects
to get. The later general statute passed as a substitute
for special bills like the one before us, allows suits in
admiralty for damages done by public vessels but excludes interest in terms. Act of March 3, 1925, c. 428,
§ 2, 43 Stat. 1112.
We are satisfied by the argument for the Government
that the policy thus expressed in the Act of 1925 had
been the policy of the United States for years before
1922, and that the many private acts like the present
generally have been understood, before and since the act
now in question, not to carry interest by the often repeated words now before us. This was stated by the
Attorney General in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Claims when the Act of 1925 was
under consideration (Sen. Report 941, p. 12, 68th Cong.,
2d Sess.) and the bill was amended so as to remove all
doubt. The Act of March 2, 1901, c. 824, 31 Stat. 1789,
believed to be the first of the private acts in the present

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

form, was passed after an amendment striking out an allowance of interest, thus showing that the words now
relied upon then were understood not to allow it. The
same thing has happened repeatedly with later acts, and
when by exception interest has been allowed, it has been
allowed by express words. Before 1901, since 1871, such
cases had been referred to the Court of Claims, which
was forbidden by statute to allow interest. Rev. Stats.
§ 1901. Code, Title 28, § 284. It is said that when the
meaning of language is plain we are not to resort to evidence in order to raise doubts. That is rather an axiom
of experience than a rule of law, and does not preclude
consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists. If Congress has been accustomed to use a certain phrase with
a more limited meaning than might be attributed to it
by common practice, it would be arbitrary to refuse to
consider that fact when we come to interpret a statute.
But, as we have said, the usage of Congress simply shows
that it has spoken with careful precision, that its words
mark the exact spot at which it stops, and that it distinguishes between the damages caused by the collision
and the later loss caused by delay in paying for the first,between damagQs and 'the allowance of interest on damages', as it is put by Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland,
118 U. S. 507.
What the Act authorizes the Court to ascertain and
allow is the 'amount of the legal damages sustained by
reason of said collision.' Of these, interest is no part. It
might be in case of the detention of money. But this is
not a claim for the detention of money, nor can any money
be said to have been detained. When a jury finds a man
guilty of a tort or a crime, it may determine not only the
facts but also a standard of conduct that he is presumed
to have known and was bound at his peril to follow. Nash
v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377. But legal fiction
never reached the height of holding a defendant bound

J., dissenting.

to know the estimate that a jury would put upon the
damage that he had caused. As the cause of action is the
damage, not the detention of the money to be paid for it,
it could be argued in a respectable Court, as late as 1886,
that at common law, even as a matter of discretion, interest could not be allowed. Frazer v. Bigelow Carpet Co.,
141 Mass. 126. And although it commonly is allowed in
admiralty, still the element of discretion is not wholly
absent there. As stated by Mr. Justice Bradley in The
Scotland, 118 U. S. 507, " The allowance of interest on
damages is not an absolute right." When the Government
is concerned, there is no obligation until the statute is
passed and the foregoing considerations gain new force.
It has been urged that the United States would claim
interest, and that, as the statute speaks of ' damages due
either for or against the United States' the claims on the
two sides stand alike. But that is not true. The United
States did not need the statute, and it has been held that,
even in the adjustment of mutual claims between an individual and the Government, while the latter is entitled to
interest on its credits, it is not liable for interest on the
charges against it. United States v. Verdier, 164 U. S. 213,
218, 219. United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., 253 U. S. 330, 336.
The mention of costs and the omission of interest again
helps the conclusion to which we come. Compare Judicial
Code, § 152, and the same, § 177. U. S. Code, Title 28,
§ 258, 284.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND,

dissenting.

In collision cases between private parties, interest, as a
general rule, is allowed upon the amount of the loss sustained. That the allowance may be to some extent in the
discretion of the court does not affect the question presented here, since the court below denied interest not as

a matter of discretion but upon the ground that it had no
power to allow it against the United States. From an
examination of the record, it fairly may be assumed that
if the case had been one between private parties interest
would have been allowed.
It is said that when interest is allowed it is no part of
the damages. But, very clearly, I think, the settled rule
is to the contrary. When the obligation to pay interest
arises upon contract, it is recoverable thereon as damages
for failure to perform; " and when recoverable in tort it
is chargeable on general principles as an additional element of damage for the purpose of full indemnity to the
injured party." 1 Sutherland on Damages (4th Ed.)
§ 300, p. 939. In Wilson v. City of Troy, 135 N. Y. 96,
the New York Court of Appeals, holding that in certain
actions sounding in tort interest is allowed "as a part of
the damages" as matter of law, said (pp. 104, 105): "The
reason given for the rule is that interest is as necessary a
part of a complete indemnity to the owner of the property as the value itself, and in fixing the damages, is not
any more in the discretion of the jury than the value . . .
In an early case in this state the principle was recognized
that interest might be allowed, by way of damages, upon
the sum lost by the plaintiff in consequence of defendant's
negligence. (Thomas v. Weed, 15 John. 255.)" These
principles find abundant support in the decisions of this
Court.
In The "Atlas," 93 U. S.302, 310, the general rule is
laid down that satisfaction for the injury sustained is the
true rule of damages, and that by this is meant that the
measure of compensation shall be equal to the amount of
injury received, to be calculated for the actual loss occasioned by the collision, upon the principle that the suiferer is entitled to complete indemnification for his loss.
Complete recompense for the injury is required.
In The " Wanata," 95 U. S.600, 615, this Court, pointing out the essential difference between costs and interest,

BOSTON SAND CO. v. UNITED STATES.

SUTHERLAND,

51

J., dissenting.

said: "Interest is not costs in any sense, and, when allowed, it should be decreed as damages, and be added to
the damages awarded in the District Court."
In United States v. North Carolina, 136 U. S.211, 216,
this Court said: " Interest, when not stipulated for by
contract, or authorized by statute, is allowed by the courts
as damages for the detention of money or of property, or
of compensation, to which the plaintiff is entitled; . .
In The "Santa Maria," 10 Wheat. 431, 445, Mr. Justice
Story, speaking for the Court, said: "Damages are often
given by way of interest for the illegal seizure and detention of property; and, indeed, in cases of tort, if given at
all, interest partakes of the very nature of damages."
In The "Umbria," 166 U. S.404, 421, this Court recognized that the general rule was that in cases of total loss
by collision damages are limited to the value of the vessel, with interest thereon, etc.
See, also, Redfield v. Ystalyfera Iron Company, 110 U.
S.174, 176; The "Scotland," 105 U. S.24, 35.
It does not seem necessary to cite the numerous decisions of the lower federal and state courts to the same
effect. A very good statement is to be found in Balano v.
The Illinois, 84 Fed. 697, where it was held that the value
of the injury done to the vessel is to be ascertained, and
then an amount equal to interest thereon to the time of
the trial may be added, not strictly as interest, but
as part of the damage compensation. The court said
[p. 698].:
"The sum called interest added to the $5,000 was
necessary to make full compensation at this time. It is
not strictly interest-which is due only for the withholding of a debt-but the compensation for the permanent
injury to the vessel was due as of the time when it was
inflicted, and the addition of what is called interest is
justly added for withholding it . . .it is quite well settlea
that in ascertaining the amount of compensation to be

52

278 U. S.

paid, it is justifiable to find the extent of the injury
valued in money, and add a sum equal to interest to make
compensation at the time of such finding."
This is in accordance with the general rule that for the
wrongful sinking of a ship the owner is entitled to restitutio in integrum, that is, he is entitled "to be put in as
good position pecuniarily as if his property had not been
destroyed." Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., 268 U. S.
146, 155, 158.
In the light of the foregoing, I am unable to see any
ground for differentiating the rule of damages applicable
to the present case from that applicable to eminent domain cases, that is to say, the owner is entitled to the
amount that would be just compensation if the ship had
been taken by the power of eminent domain. Just compensation means "the full and perfect equivalent of the
property taken . . . the owner shall be put in as good
position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken . . . the owner is not limited to
the value of the property at the time of the taking; he is
entitled to such addition as will produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. Interest at a proper rate is a good measure by which
to ascertain the amount so to be added." Seaboard Air
Line Ry. v. United States, 261 U. S. 299, 304, 306. See
also, Liggett & Myers v. United States, 274 U. S.215.
In Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S. 243, 258, the rule is
stated: " Generally, interest is not allowed upon unliquidated damages. Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall, 620, 653.
But when necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may
include interest or its equivalent as an element of
damages."
It follows indubitably from these premises that interest
isallowable against the United States by the words "legal
damages" ex vi termini. If additional reason for this

BOSTON SAND CO. v. UNITED STATES.
41

SUTHERLAND,

J., dissenting.

conclusion be needed, it will be found in the definite determination of this Court that the obligation of the
United States to pay interest may be imposed by the name
of damages as well as by the name of interest. Angarica
v. Bayard, 127 U. S.251, 260, where it is said that one of
the recognized exceptions to the rule that the United
States is not liable to pay interest is "where interest is
given expressly by an act of Congress, either by the name
of interest or by that of damages."
For this conclusion, the Court cites a number of opinions of the Attorneys General of the United States, among
them that of Attorney General Cushing reported in 7 Op.
A. G. 523, from the head-note to which the language above
quoted was taken. In the course of that opinion the
Attorney General said (p. 531):
"There is another possible case of apparent, but not
real, exception, if the case exists, and that is, of 'damages' provided by statute to be assessed against the Government. In one of the general acts above cited, a statute-interest on the detention of money is the established
rendering of the term 'damages.' (1 Stat. at Large, p.
85.) If, therefore, any such case of claim on the Government can be shown, with color of demand for interest
as 'damages,' it will be no departure from the rule
never to allow interest except on express requirement of
statute."
By the statute under consideration the United States
is made liable for "legal damages" upon the same principle and measure of liability as in like. cases between
private parties. The authorities above reviewed put the
meaning of these words beyond all reasonable doubt; and
it is not permissible to attempt to vary that meaning by
construction., The rule announced by Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95-96"Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no
room for construction. The case must be a strong one

278 U.S.

indeed, which would justify a court in departing from
the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in
search of an intention which the words themselves did
not suggest."-has, ever since, been followed by this
Court.
In Hamilton v. Rathbone, 175 U. S. 414, 419, it is
said: "The general rule is perfectly well settled that,
where a statute is of doubtful meaning and susceptible
upon its face of two constructions, the court may look
into prior and contemporaneous acts, the reasons which
induced the act in question, the mischiefs intended to be
remedied, the extraneous circumstances, and the purpose
intended to be accomplished by it, to determine its proper
construction. But where the act is clear upon its face,
and when standing alone it is fairly susceptible of but one
construction, that construction must be given to it."
(Citing cases.)
And the Court added (p. 421): "Indeed, the cases are
so numerous in this court to the effect that the province
of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, that an extended review of them is quite unnecessary. The whole doctrine applicable to the subject
may be summed up in the single observation that prior
acts may be resorted to, to solve, but not to create an ambiguity."
It was further said that if the section of law there
under consideration were an original act there would be
no room for construction, and that only by calling in the
aid of a prior act was it possible to throw a doubt upon
its proper interpretation.
The rule was tersely stated in United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396: "If the language be clear it is
conclusive. There can be no construction where there
is nothing to construe."
This is also the recognized rule of the English courts.
In one of the English decisions Lord Denman said the

court was bound to look to the language employed and
construe it in its natural and obvious sense, even though
that was to give the words of the act an effect probably
never contemplated by those who obtained the act and
very probably not intended by the legislature which enacted it. The King v. The Commissioners, 5 A. & E. 804,
816. See also, United States v. Lexington Mill Co., 232
U. S. 399; Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S.470, 485;
Russell Co. v. United States, 261 U. S.514, 519.
The enforcement of the statute according to its plain
terms results in no absurdity or injustice, for, as this
Court recently said, in holding the United States liable
for damages including interest in a collision case where
the Governmenthad come into court to assert a claim on
its own behalf: " The absence of legal liability in a case
where but for its sovereignty it would be liable does not
destroy the justice of the claim against it." United
States v. The Thekla, 266 U. S. 328, 340.
To refuse interest in this case, in my opinion, is completely to change the clear meaning of the words employed by Congress by invoking the aid of extrinsic circumstances to import into the statute an ambiguity which
otherwise does not exist and thereby to set at naught the
prior decisions of this Court and long established canons
of statutory construction.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER, MR. JUSTICE SANFORD
JUSTICE STONE concur in this opinion.
