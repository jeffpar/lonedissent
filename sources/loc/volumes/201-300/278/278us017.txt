MANEY v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 27.

Argued October 11, 1928.-Decided October 22, 1928.

1. A certificate of citizenship which was granted by the District
Court without authority and contrary to law, is a certificate "illegally procured " within the meaning of § 15, Naturalization Act of
1906, directing district attorneys to institute proceedings for cancellation. P. 22.
2. Under the Act of 1906, a certificate from the Department of Labor
stating the date, place and manner of the applicant's arrival in the
United States must be filed with the petition for naturalization.
This requirement is jurisdictional, and failure to comply with it
cannot be cured by a subseqwent, filing allowed nunc pro tune.
So held where the decree was made within ninety days after the
actual filing of the certificate. P. 23.
3. A decree of the District Court admitting an applicant to citizenship against the objection of the United States that the court had
no jurisdiction because a certificate of arrival was not filed until
after the filing of the petition for naturalization, is not res judicata
barring a suit by the United States under § 15 of the Naturalization

CERTIORARI, 276 U. S. 609, to a decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, which reversed a decree of the District
Court, 13 F. (2d) 662, dismissing a petition to cancel a
certificate of naturalization.

Messrs. Bruno V. Bitker and Louis Marshall, with
whom Mr. Edwin S. Mack was on the brief, for petitioner.
The petition, having set forth a substantial claim under
a federal statute, was a case within the jurisdiction of the
District Court. Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U. S.
291; General Investment Co. v. New York Central R. R.
Co., 271"U. S. 228; Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487.
The duty of passing upon the merits of a petition, presupposes jurisdiction. Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S.
568.
Since the trial court had jurisdiction, it possessed the
inherent power to cure defects. In re Denny, 240 Fed.
845; Tutun v. United States, supra; Rev. Stats. § 954;
Equity Rule 19, 1912; Jud. Code, § 274a.
The power to cure defects and amend pleadings is one
of the fundamental discretionary rights of the courts.
Mexican Ry. v. Pinkney, 149 U. S. 194; In re Wright, 134
U. S. 135.
Assuming that the particular defect is jurisdictional
rather than procedural, the trial court has power to permit jurisdictional averments through amendments. McEldowney v. Card, 193 Fed, 475; Atchison, etc. Ry. v.
Gilliland, 193 Fed. 608; Howard v. de Cordova, 177 U. S.
609; Norton v. Larney, 266 U. S. 511.
The facts do not constitute a showing of "good cause"
that the certificate of citizenship was " illegally procured."
United States v. Richmond, 17 F. (2d) 28. " Illegally
procured " must be distinguished from a decree based on
procedural defect. Luria v. United States, 231 U. S. 9.

Argument for the United States.

The juxtaposition of the words "fraud" and "illegally
procured" in § 15 indicates that illegal procurement was
to be an act similar in character to "fraud."
The Government's remedy upon a judgment in which
a procedural defect has occurred, is through appeal only.
Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S. 568; Luria v. United
States, 231 U. S. 9; United States v. Richmond, 17 F. (2d)

States v. Srednik, 19 F. (2d) 71; United States v. Lenore,
207 Fed. 865; United States v. Erickson, 188 Fed. 747.
The decree admitting the petitioner to citizenship is
res judicata. In the present proceedings no new question
of fact or of law is raised. The records in both proceedings are practically identical.
See Johannessen v. United States, 225 U. S. 227; United
States v. Ginsberg, 243 U. S. 472; United States v. Ness,
245 U. S. 319; United States v.. Pandit, 15 F. (2d) 285,

(2d) 28; United States v. Lenore, 207 Fed. 865; United
States v. Srednik, 19 F. (2d) 71.
The serious consequences of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case cannot be exaggerated.
Such an action as is contemplated by § 15 does not seem
to be barred by any statute of limitations. Consequently
an action of this character may be brought long after
the decree of naturalization has been granted, and after
real property has been acquired by the person naturalized
and his status has in many ways been affected.

of arrival shall be filed with the petition is one of substance, and the naturalization courts have no discretion to
dispense with it. United States v. Ginsberg,243 U. S. 472;
United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319; In re Liberman, 193
Fed. 301; Ex parte Eberhardt,270 Fed. 334; In re Olsen,

571; United States v. Martorana,171 Fed. 397; Ex parte
Lange, 197 Fed. 769; In re Friedl, 202 Fed. 300.
The failure to file the certificate of arrival with the
petition makes the naturalization one illegally procured
within the meaning of § 15, authorizing cancellation proceedings. United States v. Ginsberg, supra; United States
v. Mulvey, 232 Fed. 513; United States v. Koopmans, 290
Fed. 545; United States v. Albertini, 206 Fed. 133; United
States v. Shanahan, 232 Fed. 169; United States v. Ness,
supra.
Congress has not attempted to provide for appeals
from naturalization decrees entered in state courts. In
at least three States the state courts have held that the
state laws do not provide for such appeals. If the right
to assail naturalization certificates by proceedings under
§ 15 is denied in cases where there has been a disregard of
requirements of law by such state courts, the United
States would have no remedy, unless thrpugh petition for
certiorari to this Court under § 237 (b) of the Judicial
Code.
If a cancellation proceeding is within the scope of § 15,
the defense of res judicata is not available against the
United States because of its appearance in the naturalization case. United States v. Ness, supra; United States v.
Ovens, 13 F. (2d) 376; United States v. Milder, supra;

Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioner obtained a certificate of naturalization
by a decree of a District Court of the United States in
February, 1924. In June, 1925, the United States filed a
petition to have the certificate cancelled on the ground
that it was illegally procured. The District Court dismissed the Government's suit, 13 F. (2d) 662. But this
decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and
an order cancelling the certificate of naturalization was
directed. 21 F. (2d) 28. A writ of certiorari was granted
by this Court, 276 U. S. 609.
The petition for naturalization was filed on November
13, 1923, but at that time there was not filed the certificate from the Department of Labor stating the date,
place, and manner of arrival in the Urfited States, and the
declaration of intention of such petitioner, which the
Mturalization Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, § 4, 34 Stat.
596 (Code, Title 8, § 380), required to be attached to and
made part of the petition. It is said that the Department
of Labor did not issue the certificate until November 24,
1923, and it was not mailed to the clerk of the Naturalization Court until December 3. The hearing on naturalization took place on February 11, 1924, and the District
Court, against the objection of the United States, ordered
the certificate filed and attached to the petition nunc pro
tunc, as of the date when the petition was filed, and made
the decree purporting to admit the petitioner to citizenship that has been anhulled in the present proceeding.
The petitioner says that the original decree made the
question res judicata, and that it was right, or at least
within the power of the Court.
By § 15 of the Naturalization Act, (C., § 405,) it is
made the duty of district attorneys upon affidavit showing good cause therefor to institute proceedings for cancellation "on the ground that the certificate of citizenship

was illegally procured." The first question is whether
the certificate was illegally procured within the meaning of § 15. If the statute makes it a condition precedent
to the authority of the Court to grant a petition for
naturalization that the Department of Labor's certificate
of arrival shall be filed at the same time, then, when it
appears on the face of the record that no such certificate
has been filed, a decree admitting to citizenship is bad. It
is illegal in the sense that it is unauthorized by and contrary to the law. United States v. Ginsberg, 243 U. S.
472, 475. United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 324, 325.
We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals
was right in holding that the filing with the petition of
the certificate of arrival was a condition attached to the
power of the court. Although the proceedings for admission are judicial, Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S. 568,
they are not for the usual purpose of vindicating an existing right but for the purpose of getting granted to an alien
rights that do not yet exist. Hence not only the conditions attached to the grant, but those attached to the
power of the instrument used by the United States to
make the -grant must be complied with strictly, as in other
instances of Government gifts. By § 4 of the Act an alien
may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States
in the manner prescribed, "and not otherwise." And by
the same section the certificate from the Department of
Labor is to be filed "at the time of filing the petition."
(C., §§ 372, 379.) The form provided by § 27 (C., § 409)
alleges that the certificate is attached to and made a part
of the petition. The Regulations of the Secretary of
Labor embodied our' interpretation of the law, and would
have warned the petitioner if she had consulted them.
Rule 5, Ed. February 15, 1917; Ed. September 24, 1920.
United States v. Ness, 245 U. S.319, 323. It already has
been decided that the filing of the certificate is an essential prerequisite to a valid order of naturalization, United

MANEY v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

States v. Ness, supra, and that a hearing in chambers adjoining the courtroom does not satisfy the requirement
of a hearing in open Court. United States v. Ginsberg,
243 U. S. 472. The reasoning that prevailed in those cases
must govern this. A hearing in less than ninety days
from the public notice required by § .6 (Code, § 396)
surely would have been as bad as a hearing in chambers.
But as it has been decided that no valid decree could be
made until the certificate was filed and as the hearing
took place and the decree was entered in less than ninety
days from the time when the certificate was received the
want of power seems to us doubly plain. If, after the certificate came, the petition had been refiled, a new notice
had been given and ninety days had been allowed to
elapse before the hearing, there would be a different case.
It is said that the District Court had control of procedural matters and could cure formal defects. Very likely
it had power to cure defective allegations, but it had not
power to supply facts. If, as we decide, the petitioner
was required to file the Department of Labor's certificate
at the same time that she filed her petition, the District
Court could not cure her failure to do so and enlarge its
own powers by embodying in an order a fiction that the
certificate was filed in time.
As the certificate of citizenship was illegally obtained,
the express words of § 15 authorize this proceeding to
have it cancelled. The judgment attacked did not make
the matter res judicata,as against the statutory provision
for review. The difference between this and ordinary
cases already has been pointed out and would be enough
to warrant a special treatment. But it hardly can be called
special treatment to say that a record that discloses on its
face that the judgment transcends the power of the judge
may be declared void in the interest of the sovereign who
gave to the judge whatever power he had.
Judgment affirmed.
