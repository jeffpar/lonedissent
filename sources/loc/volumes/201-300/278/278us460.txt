any such loss. It follows that we must affirm the judgments below. See Zahn v. Board of Public Works, 274
U. S. 325, 328.
There were some exceptions to the exclusion of evidence. But if they could be considered in any case they
went only to proof that the new device is better than the
old. We assume it to be so, but regard that assumption as
not controlling the point considered here.
As appeal was the proper mode of bringing the cases to
this Court the writs of error may be dismissed.

CUDAHY PACKING COMPANY v. HINKLE, SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 278.

Argued January 7, 1929.-Decided February 18, 1929.

1. State taxation of a foreign corporation admitted to do business
in a State, in the form of a filing fee and a license tax, both reckoned upon its authorized capital stock, held a burden on interstate
commerce, and an attempt to reach property beyond the jurisdiction of the State contrary to the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, in a case where the property of the
corporation within the State and the part of its business there
transacted (less than half of it intrastate) were but small fractions,
respectively, of its entire property and of its business transacted
in other parts of the Union and abroad, and where the amount of
capital stock authorized was much more than the amount of the
stock issued and the value of the total assets. The laws imposing
the taxes fixed maximum limits of $3,000.00 each; and the taxes
actually demanded were $545.00 and $580.00, respectively. P. 465.
2. A state tax that really burdens the interstate commerce of a
foreign corporation and reaches property beyond the State, cannot be sustained upon the ground that it is relatively small.

APPEAL

Argument for Appellant.

from a decree of a District Court of three

judges refusing an interlocutory injunction and dis-

missing the bill in a suit to enjoin state officials from
proceeding to enforce penalties against the plaintiff
foreign corporation for its failure to pay filing fees and
license taxes prescribed by the state law.
Messrs. J. Harry Covington and S. W. Brethorst, with
whom Messrs. E. B. Palmer, Thomas M. Askren, and
Thomas Creigh were on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Levi B. Donley, Assistant Attorney General of
Washington, with whom Mr. John H. Dunbar,Attorney

General, was on the brief, for appellees.
An excise tax may be graduated according to the
amount of the authorized stock of a corporation and,
if a reasonable maximum be fixed, the law will be
upheld as a reasonable exercise of the state taxing
power and not a burden upon interstate commerce.
Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachussetts, 231 U. S. 68.
The only distinction betwen the Kansas statute, disapproved in Western Union v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1,
and the Massachusetts statute, approved in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, is that a reasonable
maximum was not provided in the former. The Baltic
case is followed and approved in St. Louis, etc. Ry. v.
Arkansas, 235 U. S. 350; Kansas City, etc. Ry. v.
Botkin, 240 U. S. 227; Kansas City, etc. Ry. v. Styles, 242
U. S. 111; Virginia Ry. Signal Co. v. Virginia, 246
U. S. 500.
As for the contention that the doctrine announced in
the Baltic case, and followed by other cases, has been
abandoned and overruled by later cases, see the opinion
of the District Court in the case at bar, 24 F. (2d) 124.

proposition that where a foreign corporation is engaged

solely in interstate commerce, the several States may not
impose an excise tax upon it as a prerequisite to its engaging in such commerce, and that the Baltic case, in so
far as it might affect such a situation, is expressly overruled. This Court has never held invalid an excise graduated in accordance with the authorized capital stock
of the corporation, where the corporation was engaged in
intrastate business and where a reasonable maximum fee
was provided for in the statute. Cf. Airway Corp'n v.
Day, 266 U. S.. 71; Looney v. Crane Co., 245 U. S. 178.
Cases involving excise taxes sought to be collected by
a State from a corporation engaged solely in interstate
commerce are not in point, as is true where no maximum
tax is fixed. Referring to: International Paper Co.. v.
Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 135; Locomobile Co. v. Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 146; Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massa,
chusetts, 246 U. S. 147; International Text Book Co,. v.
Pigg, 217 U. S. 91; Buck Stove Co. v. Vickers, 226 U. S.
205; Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268
U. S. 203.
The Washington excise tax is reasonable in amount and
has a reasonable maximum.
Mr. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Appellant is incorporated under the laws of Maine.
Its authorized capital stock is $45,000,000. Less than
$30,000,000 has been issued and the total value of the
corporate property does not exceed that sum. It does an
extensive business in meats and foodstuffs throughout the
Union and abroad. During 1916 when the capital stock
was $20,000,000 the articles of incorporation were duly
filed with the proper state officer and the corporation began to carry on closely associated interstate and intrastate
business in Washington. Its property therein is now
worth $40,000. Gross sales by the corporation for the

year ended October 31, 1926, were $231,750,000. Of
these $1,313,275 were made in Washington, less than half
being intrastate.
The statutory provisions here important appear in the
sections of Remington's Compiled Statutes of Washington
mentioned below.
Sec. 3852 authorizes foreign corporations to do business
within the State as those organized under her laws upon
compliance with conditions prescribed by Sees. 3853-3854.
See. 3853 requires every foreign corporation to file with
the Secretary of State a certified copy of its charter, etc.,
and Sec. 3854 requires appointment of a local agent.
Sec. 3836 (as amended by Chap. 149, Extraordinary
Session, 1925) directs that every local and foreign corporation required by law to file its articles with the Secretary of State shall pay graduated filing fees, not above
$3,000, reckoned upon its authorized capital stock.'
Sec. 3837 requires every corporation, foreign or domestic, desiring to file with the Secretary of State articles
1 Section 3836. Every corporation incorporated under the laws of
this state, or 6f'any state or territory of the United States or of any
foreign state or country, required by law to file articles of incorporation in the office of the secretary of state, shall pay to the secretary of
state a filing fee in proportion to its authorized capital stock as
follows:
Capital not exceeding $50,000, fee $25;
Capital of more than $50,000, and less than $100,000, fee $40;
Capital of $100,000, or more, and less than $150,000, fee $75;
Capital of $150,000, or more, and less than $200,000, fee $100;
Capital of $200,000, or more, and less than $300,000, fee $150;
Capital of $300,000, or more, and less than $400,000, fee $200;
Capital of $400,000, or more, and less than $500,000, fee $250;
Capital of $500,000, or more, and less than $1,000,000, fee $500;
Capital of $1,000,000, or more, and less than $2,000,000, fee $750;
and $10 additional for each $1,000,000, or major fraction thereof, of
capital stock in excess of $2,000,000; Provided, however, That the
total filing fee for filing such articles of incorporation shall in no case
exceed the sum of $3,000.

amendatory or supplemental articles increasing its capital
stock to pay the fees prescribed in the preceding section
less any sum theretofore paid.
Sec. 3841, (as amended by Chap. 149, Extraordinary
Session, 1925) requires corporations, foreign and domestic, to pay annual license fees, not above$3,000, reckoned
upon authorized capital stock.'
Secs. 3842, 3843, 3844, 3846, 3855, and 3861 provide
heavy penalties for failure to pay prescribed filing fees
and license taxes.
Filing fees because of the increased capital, and license
taxes for 1927, both reckoned upon the authorized capital
stock, were demanded of appellant. Penalties for failure
to comply were threatened. By an original bill in the
United States District Court, Western District of Washington, it set up the above-stated facts and asked an
Section 3837. Every corporation, foreign or domestic, desiring to
file in the office of the secretary of state articles amendatory or supplemental articles increasing its capital stock, or certificates of increase of capital stock, shall pay to the secretary of state the fees
prescribed in the preceding section for the total amount to which the
capital stock of the corporation is so increased, less the amount
already paid for filing the original articles of incorporation, or
original articles and amendatory or supplemental articles, or certificates of increase, and every such corporation desiring to file
amendatory or supplemental articles decreasing, or certificates of decrease of capital stock, shall pay to the secretary of state a filing fee
of $25. For filing of other amendatory or supplemental articles, it
shall pay a fee of $10; Provided, however, That the total amount
paid by any corporation for filing its original articles of incorporation
and all of its articles amendatory or supplemental articles increasing its capital stock or certificates of increase of capital stock, shall
in the aggregate in no case exceed the sum of $3,000, plus $10 for
each separate instrument filed in addition to its original articles of
incorporation.
s Section 3841. Every corporation incorporated under the laws of
this state, and every foreign corporation, having its articles of incorporation on file in the office of the secretary of state, shall, on or
before the first day of July of each and every year, pay to the secre2

appropriate injunction to prevent enforcement of the
demands. A court of three judges heard the cause, denied
a preliminary injunction, and dismissed the bill for want
of equity.
Looney v. Crane Co.., 245 U. S. 178, 187, examined
Texas statutes which required foreign corporations to pay
permit and franchise taxes graduated according to authorized capital stock and declared them in conflict with the
Federal Constitution because they imposed "direct burdens upon interstate commerce, and, moreover, exerted
the taxing authority of the State over property and rights
which were wholly beyond the confines of the State, and
not subject to its jurisdiction, and therefore constituted
a taking without due process." These statutes prescribed
tary of state, for the use of the state, the following license fees in
proportion to its authorized capital stock, as follows:
Capital of $50,000, or less, fee $15;
Capital in excess of $50,000, and up to and including $100,000,
fee $25;
Capital in excess of $100,000, and up to and including $500,000,
fee $50;
Capital in excess of $500,000, and up to and including $1,000,000,
fee $100;
Capital in excess of $1,000,000, and up to and including $2,000,000,
fee $150; and $10 for each $1,000,000, or fraction thereof of capital
in excess of $2,000,000: Provided, however, That the total amount of
such annual license fee shall in no case exceed $3,000. Every corporation failing to pay the said annual license fee, on or before the first
day of July of any year, and desiring to pay the same thereafter, and
before the first day of January next following, shall pay to the secretary of state, for the use of the state, in addition to the said license
fee the following further fee, as a penalty for such failure, the sum
of two dollars and fifty cents: Provided, however, That building and
loan and savings and loan associations paying special fees provided
for in the act under which same are incorporated shall not be required
to pay the regular fee provided herein: Provided, further, That the
annual fee required to be paid to the Department of Public Works
by any public service company shall be deducted from the annual fee
provided herein, and the excess only shall be collected under this act.

no maximum tax. In other respects they were not unlike
the acts here under consideration.
Unless saved by the $3,000 limitation, the Washington
enactments are subject to the constitutional objections
pointed out in Looney v. Crane Co.. and must be denied'
effect.
Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts,231 U. S. 68, upheld
a tax based upon authorized capital stock, but limited to
$2,000, imposed by Massachusetts upon foreign corporations for the privilege of doing local and domestic business therein. Consideration was given to the fact that
the corporate assets were four times the authorized capital
and to the limitation. Weighing all the circumstances,
the Court concluded that no direct substantial burden
was imposed upon interstate commerce and that property
beyond the State was not taxed.
In Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268
U. S. 203, 218, we said:
"It must now be regarded as settled that a State may
not burden interstate commerce or tax property beyond
her borders under the guise of regulating or taxing intrastate business. So to burden interstate commerce is
prohibited by the commerce clause; and the Fourteenth
Amendment does not permit taxation of property beyond
the State's jurisdiction. The amount demanded is unimportant when there is no legitimate basis for the tax. So
far as the language of Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts,
231 U. S. 68, 87, tends to support a different view it conflicts with conclusions reached in later opinions and is
now definitely disapproved."
Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusettshad sometimes been
regarded as lending support to the theory that a tax which
really burdens interstate commerce and reaches property
beyond the State may be sustained if relatively small.
This view did not harmonize with the principles approved
by Looney v. Crane Co., and was expressly disapproved
by Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Mass.

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

It follows that the decree of the court below is erroneous and must be reversed.
Whether, because reckoned upon authorized and not
upon actual capital stock, the challenged legislation fails
to require like fees for equal privileges within the doctrine
of Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, 266 U. S. 71,
we need not now consider.
Reversed.
Mr. JUSTIcE BRANDEIS, dissenting.
The corporation maintains in Washington a branch
office and a warehouse. There, it does a large intrastate
business. Nearly one-half of the aggregate sales of $1,313,275.74 made within the State were local and were from
broken packages. It is subjected to two taxes which are
separate and distinct. The filing fee is payable only once
and as laid was $545. The annual license fee is $580.
The latter results in a charge of about one-tenth of one
per cent on the intrastate business. The corporation's
pay roll there is more than a hundred times as large.
These small taxes are obviously not more than a fair
contribution to the necessary expenses of the State government. They are the same for foreign corporations as for
domestic. In my opinion both taxes are valid.
If the statute sought to impose a tax on corporations
engaged wholly in interstate commerce, or if the taxes laid
a direct burden upon interstate commerce, or if they were
laid upon property without the State, or if they were
unjustly discriminatory, the fact that they are small in
amount would, of course, be immaterial. Sprout v. City
of South Bend, 277 U. S. 163, 171. But these taxes are
not subject to any of those infirmities. The taxes are
not laid upon interstate commerce. They are not measured by the amount of interstate commerce. They do not
grow, or shrink, according to the volume of interstate
commerce or of the capital used in it. They are not

J., dissenting.

278 U. S.

furtively directed against such commerce. The taxes
would be precisely the same in amount if the corporation
did in Washington no interstate business whatsoever.
Nor are they taxes laid upon property without the State.
Indeed, they are neither property taxes nor substitutes
for property taxes. They are an excise, laid solely for
the privilege of doing business as a corporation. An individual doing the same business would not be required
to pay either these taxes or any substitute therefor.
General Ry. Signal Co. v. Virginia, 246 U. S. 500,
requires, in my opinion, that the filing fee be held valid.
There, a filing fee of $1,000 on an authorized capitalization of $5,000,000 was sustained as against a foreign corporation, under a statute limiting the maximum tax to
$5,000. Here, the filing fee demanded was $545 on an
authorized capital nearly ten times as great; and the
maximum fee demandable in any case was limited to
$3,000. The General Ry. Signal Co. case was decided by
a unanimous Court and the correctness of the decision has
never been questioned.
Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 147, 15415k, requires, in my opinion, that the license fee be held
valid. That case held a statute imposing an annual license
tax valid as applied to all the foreign corporations which,
like the Cudahy Company here, did both intrastate and
interstate business. That decision was made by a unanimous Court after much deliberation. It has never been
disapproved. The statute there in question is identical,
so far as here material, with the Washington statute,
except that the Massachusetts law fixes a maximum tax of
$2,000, while here it is $3,000. But the Massachusetts
statute was enacted in 1909; and the tax there challenged
was laid in 1913. The Washington statute was enacted
in 1925; and the tax here challenged was laid in 1926. The
rise in the general price level since 1913 makes the Wash-

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

ington maximum relatively lower than that prescribed by
Massachusetts.
The Cheney Bros. Co. case is entirely consistent with
Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268 U. S.
203. In the latter case, the tax held void was on a foreign
corporation engaged solely in interstate commerce; and it
was laid under a different statute. The situation here is
also wholly unlike that considered in Air-Way Corp'n v.
Day, 266 U. S. 71, 79 and in Looney v. Crane Co., 245
U. S. 178, and cases there cited. In those cases, not only
did the statutes fail to fix a maximum, but the taxes
actually laid were so large as compared with the local
business done as to constitute a substantial obstruction of
interstate commerce. The case at bar is also unlike
InternationalPaper Co. v. Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 135.
There, the statute failed to fix any maximum.
A tax proportionate to, the capital of a corporation is
sometimes laid in lieu of the ordinary property taxes, and
in such cases is treated as a property tax. But the taxes
here in question are not of that nature. I am aware that it
has been said by this Court that a license fee of a given
per cent of the entire authorized capital of a foreign corporation doing both a local and interstate business is
essentially a tax on the entire business, interstate as well
as intrastate; and a tax upon property outside the State.
But that was said in cases where the statute did not fix
any maximum. The statement seems to me legally unsound. If it were true that every tax imposed generally
upon a foreign corporation doing both interstate and intrastate business taxed its interstate business and its
property outside the State, then most of such corporations
would largely escape taxation. By the same process of
reasoning all taxes laid by a State upon property within
its borders, which is used in both intrastate and interstate
commerce, would be a tax on interstate commerce. But

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

such taxes have been universally upheld. They are valid,
because, when the burden is indirect, even a large burden
upon interstate commerce does not render a tax void.
See Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260 U. S. 519, 530; Hump
HairpinCo. v. Emmerson, 258 U. S. 290.
It would be unfortunate to hold that merely because a
foreign corporation, doing a local business does also interstate business, the State may not lay upon it a reasonable,
non-discriminatory excise, necessarily limited to a reasonable amnount, to which all domestic corporations similarly
situated are subject and which can affect interstate commerce only indirectly, if at all. To hold such a tax void
seems to me to ignore the wise rule of decision declared in
Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688, 698:
"The substance and not the shadow determines the
validity of the exercise of the [taxing] power."
