UNITED FUEL GAS COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WEST VIRGINIA ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA.

No. 4. Argued November 23, 28, 1927. Reargued October 15, 16,
1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
1. An order of a District Court of three judges denying an interlocutory injunction will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly
the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion. P. 326.
2. Evidence to prove the value of plaintiff's natural gas land, like
that considered in United Fuel Gas Co. v. R. R. Comm'n, ante,
p. 300, held, on the authority of that case, to be insufficient to support the burden of proof in a suit challenging the adequacy of
rates fixed by a public commission. P. 326.
14 F. (2d) 209, affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree denying an application for a
preliminary injunction in a suit by the Gas Company to
restrain the Commission from interfering with the putting into effect of a new and higher schedule of gas rates.
Mr. John W.oDavis, with whom Messrs. HaroldA. Ritz,
Douglas M. Moffat, Edward L. Patterson, and Chester
J. Gerkin were on the brief, for appellant.
Messrs. F. M. Livezey and Robert S. Spilman, with
whom Messrs. Arthur G. Stone, Paul W. Scott, and

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellant is a West Virginia corporation engaged in
producing natural gas which it sells in West Virginia,

Opinion of the Court.

Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky. A part of its business is the sale of gas at wholesale to distributors and is
not regulated by any public body. Another part is the
sale of gas direct to consumers in West Virginia cities and
is subject to regulation by the appellee commission. In
April, 1924, appellant filed with the commission a schedule increasing its rates in its "regulated" business in
West Virginia. The commission, after an extensive hearing, denied this application for an increase, holding that
the existing schedule yielded a fair return on appellant's
property. P. S. C. W. Va. Bulletin 91. Appellant then
sought, by the present suit in the District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia, an injunction restraining the commission from interfering with appellant
in putting into effect its new and higher rate schedule.
Application for a preliminary injunction was heard by a
court of three judges upon the record before the commission and some additional testimony, and was denied. 14
F. (2d) 209. The case is here by direct appeal from the
order of the district court, under ยง 266 of the Judicial
-Code.
An earlier proceeding before the commission in 1917
had resulted in its order for an increase in the rate of 5
cents per 1,000 cubic feet which, in 1923, was set aside by
the Supreme Court of West Virginia. 95 W. Va. 91. A
similar case, lUnited Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of
Kentucky, 13 F. (2d) 510, coming here by appeal from
a final decree of the District Court for eastern Kentucky,
involving similar and some additional questions and denying the relief asked, was heard with this and is discussed
in a separate opinion, ante, p. 300. The two cases involve
substantially the same property and business. The issues
as to valuation are identical and so far as material here
the records as to them are practically the same.
Appellant, through ownership in fee and leases or contracts on a rental or royalty basis, controls the production

of natural gas from 814,910 acres of land. A part of this
area, the so-termed "proven" territory, is at present
being used in production, the remainder being held in
reserve as either " probable " or " unfavorable" sources
of future production. Its principal items of property consist of its interest in this acreage, working capital, buildings, machinery, mains, pipes, compressors and other
equipment used in the production and distribution of gas.
The value as claimed by appellant and as found by the
commission and the court of the total property of appellant used in both its "regulated" and "unregulated"
business, follows:
Value claimed by appellant:

The court below made no finding as to the value of
appellant's gas rights. It included in the rate base the
136,384 acres of land described by appellant's witnesses as
proven territory, that is, areas which had been thoroughly
tested and are now producing gas, and excluded 126,208
acres of land described as probable territory, that is, territory which had been partially tested or which appeared on
the basis of geological evidence and its geographical relation to productive areas to be a probable source of natural
gas. It was by this division of appellant's gas field and
the inclusion of but a part in the rate base, at the full
value claimed by appellant, that the court below reached
its assumed valuation of the gas field of $10,317,311. The
rest of the territory, consisting of 552,319 acres classified
as improbable or tinfavorable territory, was disregarded
by the court below and appellant's own expert in estimating available gas supply.
By allocating the various items of appellant's property
to the regulated business, on the basis of percentages
agreed upon by the parties, the court reached the conclusion that the following was the value of the property
used and useful in the regulated business:
As of
Dee. 31, 1923

Tangible property ...............................
Going concern value .............................
W orking capital .................................
Gas Reserve (proven territory only) ..............

$7, 530,826.00
847, 350.00
282, 546.00
2, 590, 677.00
$11,251,399.00

The court further found that a reasonable rate of return
on the property in the rate base was 12.77% (8% plus

278U. S.

1.12% depreciation,1 plus 3.65% amortization). It found
that the net earnings from the regulated business were
$1,555,593 (before deduction for depreciation and amortization) and were sufficient to pay a return of 12.77% on
more than the value as found, namely on $12,377,124.
An order of a court of three judges denying an interlocutory injunction will not be disturbed on appeal unless
plainly the result of an improvident exercise of judicial
discretion. Chicago Great Western Ry. v. Kendall, 266
U. S. 94, 100; and see Meccano, Ltd. v. Wanamaker, 253
U. S. 136, 141. To support the burden resting upon it, appellant, while challenging generally the correctness of
the court's valuation, places its chief reliance on the alleged erroneous valuation of its gas field. To support the
claim to a much higher valuation, it relies upon the same
theories and the same method of ascertaining the value
of the gas field as were pressed upon us in No. 1 [ante, p.
300.1 With respect to this item, after making the same
assumptions as in that case, we reach the same conclusion,
for reasons there stated at length, that there is no dependable evidence of value of appellant's gas field in excess of the value assumed on its books; that no ground is
presented for assigning to it a value beyond the $6,343,329
so assumed on appellant's books, a smaller value than that
used by the court in its calculations.
With respect to other conclusions of the court below,
there is no serious suggestion that the court abused its
discretion. In 1923 the case was before the highest court
of the state. The estimates now presented to this Court
1 The commission had allowed this percentage amounting to $404,333
as covering depreciation of plant. The court merely allowed the total
amount so found as plant depreciation and did not estimate depreciation at a percentage of its own rate base, which was higher than
that of the commission, the principal item of its valuation differing
from that of the commission, being its assumed value of appellant's
gas rights.

CHASE NATIONAL BANK ET AL. V. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 77. Argued November 27, 28, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
Section 401 of the Revenue Act of 1921 imposes a tax on "the
transfer of the net estate of every decedent" dying after the passage
of the Act, and ยง 402 provides that in valuing the gross estate from
which the net is computed, there shall be included the amount, over
an exemption, receivable by beneficiaries as insurance under policies
taken out by the decedent upon his own life. After the effective
date of the Act the decedent in this case procured policies on his
life payable to others but reserving to himself the right to change
beneficiaries, and paid the premiums until his death. The transfer tax assessed under the Act included an amount imposed by
reason of the inclusion in his estate of the proceeds of the policies
less exemption. Held:
(1) This part of the tax is not a direct tax onl the policies or their
proceeds, but is a tax on the privilege of transferring property of a
decedent at death. Pp. 333 et seq.
(2) The termination at death of the power of the decedent to
change beneficiaries and the consequent passing to the designated
beneficiaries of all rights under the policies freed from the possibility
of its exercise, is the legitimate subject of a transfer tax. P. 334.
(3) The fact that the proceeds of the policies were not transferred to the beneficiaries from the decedent, but from the insurer,
does not make the tax one on property. The word "transfer"
in the statute, and the privilege which may constitutionally be
taxed as an excise, includes the transfer of property procured
