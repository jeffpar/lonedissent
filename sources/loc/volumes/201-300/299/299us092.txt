v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 51.

Argued October 12, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.

1. Federal statutes taxing the carrying on of the wholesale liquor
business and imposing penalties for so doing without the payment of the tax were not in direct conflict with the National
Prohibition Act and were re6nacted by the Act of November 23,
1921,-the "Willis-Campbell Act." P. 93.
2. Such a tax is not a licensing of the liquor business, but is an
excise upon the doing of it, whether lawfully or unlawfully. Id.
82 F. (2d) 305, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 298 U. S. 652, to review the affirmance of
a sentence for dealing in liquor without having paid the
special tax.

Me John E. Dougherty, with whom Messrs. Harry C.
Heyl and Irwin S. Rubelle were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Gordon Dean argued the cause, and Solicitor
General Reed, Assistant Attorney General McMahon, and
Mr. Mahlon D. Kiefer filed a brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioners were convicted and sentenced in the
District Court under an indictment, the second count of
which charged them with conducting the business of
wholesale liquor dealers without having paid the special
tax imposed by the federal revenue laws. The judgment
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.' Certiorari
was granted limited to the question whether the statute

Opinion of the Court.

upon which the second count of the indictment was based
was repealed by the National Prohibition Act" and has
not been reinacted.
Many of the existing revenue acts imposing taxes in
respect of manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors
were superseded by the National Prohibition Act." The
effect of ยง 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act ' was to re3nact
all such laws in existence when national prohibition becarne effective, save such as were in direct conflict with
any provision of the National Prohibition Act or the
Willis-Campbell Act.' The statutes taxing the business
of conducting a wholesale liquor business and imposing
the penalties for so doing without the payment of the
taxo were not in direct conflict with the prohibition act
and were, therefore, reenacted.7 The difficulty of payiig
the excise upon the privilege of carrying on a business
which is prohibited does not preclude the prescription of
sanctions for non-payment.' Petitioners insist it is a contradiction in terms to say the laws of the United States at
the same time prohibit a'nd license an occupation. The
contention is based on misconception of the nature of the
exaction. The United States has not licensed the liquor
business but, as is clearly within its power, has laid an
