UNITED STATES v. ESNAULT-PELTERIE.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 41.

Argued October 22, 1936.-Decided December 7, 1936.

1. In a suit in the Court of Claims to recover damages under the
Act of June 25, 1910, for alleged infringement df thE plaintiff'§
patent, the validity of the patent and infringement of it are ultimate facts upon which depends the question of liability. P. 205.
2. Where in such a suit the Court of Claims makes findings of circumstantial facts, but fails to find specifically that the patent was
valid or that it was infringed, its judgment for the plaintiff cannot
be sustained unless, upon inspection of the findings of fact made,
it is plain that they suffice to compel decision of those ultimate
issues-validity and infringement-in favor of the plaintiff. P. 206.
3. The failure of the Court of Claims to make specific findings upon
the main issues of validity and infringement does riot lay upon
this Court the duty of examining, analyzing and comparing the circumstantial facts found, to ascertain whether, as a matter of law,
they establish validity and infringement. P. 206.
4. Special findings of fact may not be aided by statements in the
conclusions of law or-the opinion of the Court of Claims.to the
effect that the patent is valid and infringed. P. 206.

CERTIORARI, 298 U. S. 653, to review an interlocutory
judgment of the Court of Claims in favor of the plaintiff in a suit against the United States for infringement
of a patent.
Mr. Drury W. Cooper, with whom Solicitor General
Reed, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs.
Alexander Holtzoff and Lee A. Jackson were on the brief,
for the United States:
Mr. Eugene V. Myers, with whom Messrs. Edwin J.
Prindle and R. Keith Kane were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent is a citizen and resident of the French
Republic and authorized to sue the United States in the
Court of Claims.' His amended complaint alleges a cause
of action under the Act of June 25, 1910, as amended,'
for the use and manufacture ily or for the United States
of a device covered by his patent No. 1,115,795, dated
November 3, 1914, which describes means for the control
of the equilibrium of airplanes by the simple oscillation
of a single lever moving in all directions and operated
by one hand. Defendant filed a general traverse. After
taking evidence, the court made special findings and
stated as its conclusion of law that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. It did not specifically find the patent
valid or that defendant infringed it. The record does not
show whether at first the conclusion of law contained
any statement as to validity or infringement. Pursuant
'Judicial Code, § 155, 28 U. S. C., § 261.
'Act of June 25, 1910,.36 Stat. 851, as amended by Act of July 1,

Opinion of the Court.

to stipulation and in accordance with its rule, the court
postponed entry of final judgment pending the taking of testimony upon the question of compensation.'
On defendant's motion, the court amended its conclusion
of law to read: "Upon the foregoing special findings of
fact, which are made a part of the judgment herein, the
court decides as a conclusion of law that the plaintiff's patent is valid and has been infringed by the United States
and that he is entitled to compensation therefor under the
act of June 25, 1910 . . ." It filed an opinion in which
it states: "In 'conclusion we hold that the patent in suit
is valid and has been infringed by the defendant." The
court entered judgment in accordance with the amended
conclusion of law. We granted writ of certiorari. 4
Plaintiff's contentions are based on claims 2 and 5 to
9. Claim 2 is: "An aeroplane having distortable wings
for maintaining transverse stability, a rudder for maintaining longitudinal stability, a lever controlling said
wings and said rudder, a steering rudder, and a separate
lever controlling said steering rudder." Claim 5 is: "In
an aeroplane, the combination of means for producing
'"In any patent suit it -hall be competent for the parties to stipulate that the hearing in the first instance be limited to the issues of
'validity and infringement and when no such stipulation can be reached
by the parties the court may prder such procedure to be followed..
"If the patent is held valid and infringed by the United States the
court shall so adjudge and the case shall thereafter proceed according
to law." Court of Claims Rule 39.
'"In any case in the Court of Claims .
.
it shall be competent for the Supreme Court, upon the petition of either party,
to require, by certiorari, that the cause, including the findings of fact
and the judgment or decree, but omitting the evidence, be certified to
it for review and determination with the same power and authority,
and with like effect, as if the cause had been brought there by :-,ppeal."

lateral stability, means for producing longitudinal stability, and a single vertical lever movable in every direction for operating both said means for producing lateral
stability and said means for producing longitudinal stability." Each of the other claims relied on contains the
substance of clain 5 with variations and additions not
here important.
On the facts found the 1etitioner contends: Respondent's patent is invalid as claiming a device not patentable
over prior disclosures. No element of invention is found
in the asserted instinctive character of the operation of the
control lever. The patent, if held valid in any respect,
should be limited to a combination comprising a pair of
vertical control levers with a single integral or unitary
tail surface -of an airplane, and so construed is not infringed. The vertical control lever did not constitute
invention over the structure disclosed in the respondent's
1906 French patent, application for which was filed more
than one year before that for the patent in suit.' The
claims are not supported by the disclosure. Plaintiff's
patent is invalid because the claims on the control lever
were not inserted in the application until five and onehalf years after filing, while the device came into general
use in the United States prior to that time.

"No person otherwise entitled thereto shall be debarred from re-

ceiving a patent for his invention or discovery, nor shall any patent
be declared invalid by reason of its having been first patented or
caused to be patented by the inventor or his legal representatives or
assigns in a foreign country, unless the application for said foreign
patent was filed more than twelve months, in cases within the provisions of section 31 of this title, . . .prior to the filing of the application in this country, in which case no patent shall be granted in
this country. . . ." R. S., § 4887, (§ 25, Act of July 8, 1870, 16
Stat. 201) as amended by § 3, Act of March 3, 1897, 29 Stat. 693
and § 1, Act of March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1225. 35 U. S. C., § 32.

Opinion of the Court.

Validity and infringement are ultimate facts on which
depends the question of liability.' In actions at law they
are to be decided by the jury. If the evidence is not sufficient to establish validity and infringement, it is the duty
of the trial court to direct a verdict for defendant.! Similarly a judgment upon a special verdict cannot be sustained unless the findings extend to all material issues.8
The same principle governs in cases brought here from
the Court of Claims.9 On writ of certiorari to that court,
the record is required to include the pleadings, findings
of fact and the judgment. The opinion, if any, is also
included. The findings are required to be in the nature
of a special verdict and specifically to set forth the ultimate facts; the evidence is not brought up." As by its
general traverse defendant put in issue all allegations of
the complaint, the findings in order to be sufficient to sustain judgment for plaintiff must specifically decide ques-.
tions of validity and infringement, and also include circumstantial facts sufficient to warrant the court's conclu' Wood v. Underhill,5 How. 1, 5-6. Battin v. Taggert, 17 How. 74,

sion in respect of the main issues." The special findings
may not be aided by statements in the conclusions of
3 to the effect that the
law 12 or the opinion of the court 1
patent is valid and infringed.
The court having failed to find that the patent was
valid or had been infringed, the judgment cannot be sustained unless upon inspection of the findings of fact it is
plain that they are sufficient to compei decision of those
issues in favor of plaintiff. 14 The contentions of the parties-briefly above indicated-raise complicated and difficult questions affecting validity and infringement. There
are 47 findings of fact covering more than 32 pages of the
record and by reference including 28 exhibits on 266
pages. The failure of the lower court to make specific
findings upon the main issues doesnot lay upon this court
the duty of examining, analyzing and comparing the circumstantial facts found to ascertain Whether as a matter
of law they establish validity and infringement. 5
The judgment will be vacated, the case will be remanded to the Court of Claims for such proceedings in
harmony with this opinion as that court may determine,
