SOUTIIEASTERN EXPRESS CO. v. PASTIME
AMUSEMENT CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 46.

Submitted October 22, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.

Under the Carmack Amendment, a shipper can recover from a
carrier as damages for interruption of the shipper's business
through tardy delivery of the goods, no more than the declared
value of the goods, made the limit of the carrier' liability by the
contract of shipment in consideration of a lower rate allowed
the shipper and in accordance with the carrier's tariffs.
181 S. C. 203; 186 S. E. 283, reversed.

Mr. Harry L. Greene, with whom Messrs. Revibert
Marshall and Nath B. Barnwell were on the brief, submitted for petitioner.
No appearance for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

Respondent sued to recover damages for failure to deliver a moving picture film in time to be exhibited as
advertised. The jury rendered a verdict for $1500 and
the judgment thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court
of South Carolina. 181 S. C. 203. The court overruled
petitioner's contention based on the federal act known
as the Carmack Amendment. 49 U. S. C. 20 (11). It appeared that the shipment was interstate, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. The applicable tariff filed by the carrier provided:
"In consideration of the rate charged for carrying said
property, which is dependent upon the value thereof and
is based upon an agreed valuation of not exceeding fifty
dollars for any'shipment of 100 pounds or less, and not
exceeding fifty cents per pound, actual weight, for any
shipment in excess of 100 pounds, unless a greater value
is declared at the time of shipment, the shipper agrees

S. E. EXPRESS CO. v. PASTIME CO.
28

Opinion of the Court.

that the company shall not be liable in any event for
more than fifty dollars for any shipment of 100 pounds
or less, or for more than fifty cents per pound, actual
weight, for any shipment weighing more than 100 pounds
unless a greater value is stated herein. Unless a greater
value is declared and stated herein the shipper agrees
that the value of the shipment is as last above set out
and that the liability of the company shall in no event
exceed such value."
There was evidence that the value declared was fifty
dollars and that the rate was fixed accordingly. The
trial court ruled that as the suit was for damages for the
interruption of plaintiff's business caused by the delay
alleged to be due to negligence, the limitation of liability
did not apply. The Supreme Court of the State sustained that view.
We hold that this was error. The federal statute controls. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491,
505, 506; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Carl, 227 U. S.
639, 650-652; Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v.
Blish Co., 241 U. S. 190, 196, 197. The words of the
statute "are comprehensive enough to embrace all damages resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier's
duty with respect to any part of the transportation to
the agreed destination." The statute thus applies to
damages caused by delay in making delivery. New York,
P. & N. R. Co. v. Peninsula Exchange, 240 U. S. 34, 38;
Georgia,F. & A. Ry. Co. v. Blish Co., supra. The underlying principle is that the carrier is entitled to base rates
upon value and that its compensation should bear a reasonable relation to the risk and responsibility assumed.
Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Carl, supra. The broad
purpose of the federal act is to compel the establishment
of reasonable rates and to provide for their uniform application. Special contracts are not permitted to give any
advantage to a particular shipper. Chicago & Alton R.

299 U. S.

Co. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155, 166. The liability in this
instance is thus governed by the provisions of the applicable tariff and no recovery could be had in excess of the
amount permitted by its terms. New York, P. & N. R.
Co. v. PeninsulaExchange, supra, pp. 41, 42; Southern
Express Co. v. Byers, 240 U. S. 612, 614; Southern Ry.

Express Co. v. Daniel, 269 U. S. 40, 42.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
Reversed.
