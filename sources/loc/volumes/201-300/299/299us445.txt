KUEHNER ET AL., TRUSTEES, v. IRVING TRUST
CO., TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 354. Argued December 15, 1936.-Decided January 4, 1937.

1. Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act provides that in proceedings
to reorganize a bankrupt corporation, the claim of a landlord for
indemnity under a covenant contained in a lease which has been
rejected by the trustee in bankruptcy "shall be treated as a claim
ranking on a parity with debts which would be provable under § 63
(a) of the Act but shall be limited to an amount not to exceed
the rent, without acceleration, reserved by said lease for the three
years next succeeding .. .the date of reentrv of the landlord."

Held:
(1)The language being clear, its meaning cannot be affected by
resort to the legislative history. P. 449.
(2) If, upon liquidation by deduction of present rental value
from the present value of rent reserved, the difference exceeds
the amount of the total reit for the three years succeeding the
landlord's reentry, the claim may be allowed only for that amount;
the surplus is not to have priority over the interests of stockholders or to be reserved as a liability of the reorganized corporation. P. 450.
(3) Thus applied, the Act does not exceed the power to legislate upon the subject of bankruptcies nor violate the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment. P. 450.
2. Bankruptcy laws seek equitable distribution of the debtor's assets
amongst his creditors; and Congress, in determining what such an
equitable distribution demands, is free to establish standards of
provability and measures of allowance, regardless of the claimant's
ability to maintain an action in a court or the measure of his
recovery in such an action if maintainable. P. 450.
3. As respects the exertion of the bankruptcy power, there is a
significant difference between a property interest and a contract,
since the Constitution does not forbid impairment of the obligations of contracts under that power. P. 451.
4. The Fifth Amendment does not prohibit bankruptcy legislation
affecting the creditor's remedy for enforcement of a contract against
the debtor's assets, or affecting the measure of the creditor's par-

ticipation therein, if the statutory provisions are consonant with
a fair, reasonable, and equitable distribution of those assets.
P. 452.
5. The object of § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act is to extend the
bankruptcy system to the reorganization of certain types of insolvent or embarrassed business corporations in the interests of
the public, the creditors, and the shareholders; in discharging the
claims of landlords, it admits them to participation with other
creditors on a basis deemed by Congress to be equitable, giving
them a new and more certain remedy for a limited amount, in
lieu of an old remedy inefficient and uncertain in its result. This
is not a taking of the landlord's property without due process of
law. P. 452.
6. The limit set upon landlords' claims cannot be regarded as an
arbitrary discrimination between them and other creditors. P. 453.
7. The limit fixed upon landlords' claims cannot be regarded as whimsical and arbitrary merely because, being general and uniform, it
cannot have the same relation in all cases to the actual losses of
different landlords. P. 453.

KUEHNER v. IRVING TRUST CO.
445

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
'In this case we are concerned with that portion of subsection (b) (10) of § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act which
limits the claim of a landlord for indemnity under a covenant in a lease to an amount not to exceed three years'
rent.
The questions are: (1) Is the claim so limited in all
events and for all purposes or is the surplus over the
specified amount, though subordinated to the claims of
other creditors, to have priority over the interests of
stockholders or to be reserved as a liability of the reorganized corporation? (2) If the claim is limited in all
events to the named amount, is the provision obnoxious
to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution?
The petitioners leased real 'estate to United Cigar
Stores Company in 1926 for a term expiring in 1946.
August 29, 1932, the company was adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt. November 14, 1932, the trustee rejected
the lease and abandoned the premises. The following
day the petitioners reentered and terminated the leasehold in accordance with the provisions of the lease which
contained a covenant by the lessee to indemnify them
against all loss of rent from such termination. Immediately upon adoption of § 77B the bankrupt filed, its petition for reorganization thereunder, which was approved
by the court.
The petitioners presented a proof of claim, measuring
the injury resulting from the termination of the leasehold
by the difference between the rental value and the value
of the rent reserved for the remainder of the term. They
prayed that the amount claimed be ranked on a parity
with other provable debts to the extent of three years'
rent and, as to the balance, be subordinated to other provable debts but awarded priority over the claims or inter-

ests of the debtor's stockholders. The trustee asked that
the allowance be in an amount limited as provided by the
statute. Committees representing preferred stockholders
and debenture holders objected to allowance of the claim
in any amount, asserting the petitioners could not sue on
the covenant of indemnity under the state law until the
expiration of the term and, having no presently enforceable claim under state law, had none in the reorganization
proceeding. The petitioners amended their pleading by
adding a prayer that to the extent any portion of the claim
might be held not allovwable a charge be reserved Ugainst
the debtor's assets for such portion in priority to any
interest accorded stockholders.
The uncontroverted testimony is that the fair rental
value for the balance of the term is $111,545.36. The future instalments of rent to the end of the term aggregate
$199,237.66. A special master recommended that the pe-.
titioners' claim be allowed and liquidated at the amount
of the difference between present rental value and Rresent value of the rent reserved. He found that the sum
so ascertained would be not less than the equivalent of
three years' rent and recommended allowance of the claim
on a parity with provable debts to the extent of three
years' rent,-$44,377.55,-and the reservation of all
questions as to the balance until the time for classification of creditors and consideration of a reorganization
plan. The District Court confirmed the master's report
save that it decided the claim as allowed should represent
the extent of claimants' right to participate in the proceedings. Cross appeals were taken to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, which held that petitioners had a provable'
claim, that the method adopted for the liquidation of the
claim was proper, that § 77B required limitation of allowance to a sum not in excess of 'the. three years' rent
mentioned in the statute and that such limitation does
not take petitioners' property without due process of law

in violation of the Fifth Amendment.' We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions involved.
The respondent Stockholders' Commi, ee does not now
deny that the petitioners have a provable'-claim but joins
the trustee in support of the decision below that the allowance must be limited for all purposes of the proceeding to
three years' rent.
We have held in City Bank FarmersTrust Co. v. Irving
Trust Co., 2 ante, p. 433, that the broad definition of creditors in § 77B gives the petitioners a provable claim for
,breach of the debtor's covenant of indemnity. The section, however, limits the amount for which such %claim'
may be allowed. The relevant provision, so far as applicable to petitioners' claim is:
"The claim of a landlord . . . for... indemnity under
a covenant contained in such lease shall be treated as a
claim rakking on a parity :with debts which would be
provable under section 63 (a) of this Act, but shall be
limited to an amount not to exceed -the rent, without
acceleration, ?eserved by said lease for the three 'years
next succeeding . . . the date of reentry of the landlord, .
The legislative history of this prQvision, and the successive alterations of its wording in both houses of Congress and in conference, to which we are referred, cannot
affect its interpretation, since the language of the act as
adopted is clear. The only phrase to which petitioners
point in support of their contention that the claim is to
be divided into two parts, one for an amount not exceeding thkee years' rent, to stand on a parity with other
provable claims, and the other, representing the balance,
t'o be subordinated to creditors' claims, but 'referred to
the interest of. stockholders, is: "shall be tteated as a claim

ranking on a parity with debts which would be provable
under section 63 (a)." We need not consider the suggestion that the words "on a parity" were left in the clause
per incuriam when formulation of an earlier draft was
altered, since, in our opinion, their presence however they
came to be inserted, cannot overcome the direct mandate
that "the claim . . . shall be limited." We agree, therefore, with the Circuit Court of Appeals that if, upon liquidation by deduction of present rental value from the
present value of rent reserved, the difference exceeds the
amount of the total rent for the three years succeeding
the landlord's reentry, the claim may be allowed only for
that amount.
A more serious question is raised by the petitioners'
insistence that thus applied the act exceeds legislative
powers granted and infringes personal guaranties given
by the Constitution. They say that the prescribed method
will in some instances limit the amount allowed to a figure
less than the landlord's actual ultimate loss, and thus
partially destroy his remedy for enforcement of his contract. The resulting violations of the Constitution, they
assert, are the transgression of the boundaries of the bankruptcy power vested in Congress, and the taking of their
property without due process.
Is the enactment in excess of the power to legislate on
the subject of bankruptcies, conferred upon Congress by
Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution? Congress evidently considered the limitation imposed on claims of this class necessary or advantageous to a successful reorganization and its
judgment is conclus ve upon us, if the enactment is within
its power.
The petitiorqers concede Congress has power to exclude
contingent claims from proof and allowance so long as the
obligations they represent are not extinguished by the
statute.! They refer, however, to the statement in Louis'Compare Manhattan Properties, Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., 291
U. S. 320, 332.

Opinion of the Court.

ville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, that
Congress has never attempted to supply a bankrupt with
capital to engage in business at the expense of his creditors,
as persuasive that a statute cannot discharge a binkrupt's
assets from liability for his debts but can only discharge
the bankrupt from encumbrances on his future e-kertions'
This principle, they assert, the statute violates. The short
answer is that the object of bankruptcy laws is.th equitable distribution of the .debtor's assets amongst his creditors; 'and the validity of the challenged provision must be
tested by its appropriateness to that end. Congress, in
determining what such an equitable distribution demands,
is free to establish standards of provability and measures
of allowance regardless of the claimant's ability to maintain an action in a court or the measure of his recovery in
such an action if maintainable. The contested provision
is within the power of Congress. The exercise of the power
is, nevertheless, subject to the commands of the. Fifth
Amendment.'
Does the Act offend the due process guaranty by destruction of rights conferred by the petitioners' contract?
They affirm that it does, not merely by impairing those
rights but by a direct taking pro tanto of all remedies for
their enforcement and, to that extent, of the contract
itself. Conceding they have no lien upon, or property
right in, the debtor's assets, such as was the subject of
decision in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radlford,
supra, they maintain that the Fifth Amendment assures
them some effective procedure for the enforcement of the
obligation of their contract; that the debtor's assets are a
trust fund for creditors which cannot be invaded for the
benefit of stockholders. As pointed out in the case last
cited there is, as respects the exertion of the bankruptcy

power, a significant difference between a property interest and a contract, since the Constitution does not forbid
impairment of the obligation of the latter. The equitable
distribution of the bankrupt's assets, or the equitable
adjustment of creditors' claims in respect of those assets,
by way of reorganization, may therefore be regulated
by a bankruptcy law which impairs the obligation of
the debtor s contracts. Indeed every bankruptcy act
avowedly works such impairment. While, therefore, the
Fifth Amendment forbids the destruction of a contract
it does not prohibit bankruptcy legislation affecting the
3reditor's remedy for its enforcement against the debtor's
assets, or the measure of the creditor's participation therein, if the statutory provisions are consonant with a fair,
reasonable, and equitable distribution of those assets.
The law under consideration recognizes the petitioners'
claim and permits it to share in the consideration to be
distributed in reorganization. The question is whether
the remedy is circumscribed in so unreasonable and arbitrary a way as to deny due process.
Bankruptcy originated as a seizure of the debtor's assets for equitable distribution amongst creditors. It was
akin to a t4king in execution. The concept was subsequently broadened to embrace the discharge of the embarrassed debtor from antecedent debts and to make the
process available at his instance as well as at that of his
creditors. Claims not provable, since they did not participate in the avails of the bankrupt's assets, were not
discharged but remained recoverable by action against
the discharged bankrupt. The object of § 77B was to
extend the system to permit and facilitate the reorganization of certain types of insolvent or embarrassed business
corporations. The theory of the legislation is that the
extension will serve the interests of the public, the creditors, and the shareholders.

KUEHNER v. IRVING TRUST CO.
445

Opinion of the Court.

If the bankruptcy act was to be broadened to embrace
reorganization of corporate debtors the wisdom of relieving them of continuing liability for rent or under contracts of indemnity was apparent. And if the laudlords'
claims were to be discharged in the reorganization they
must be admitted to participation on an equitable. basis
with other claims in shaping the reorganization and in
distribution of that which is to go to creditors pursuant to
any plan adopted. The section therefore made such
claims provable. Its legislative history attests the diverse views entertained in Congress as to the amount for
which a claim should be allowed. Only after mature deliberation was the limit set at the amount fixed in the act;
The reasonableness of the limitation is to be determined
in the light of all circumstances Congress might properly
consider.
In City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Irving Trust Co.,
ante, p. 433, the peculiar and unfortunate status of landlords' claims under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 is described. The tenant's bankruptcy removed all his assets
from the reach of the landlord and left, as the latter's
only remedy, suits against an empty corporate shell or
a destitute individual. In framing the reorganization,
statute Congress obviously attempted to award landlords
an equitable share in the debtor's assets as, ih justice,
it was bound to do since the purpose was to discharge
the debtor from liability to future suits based upon the
lease. It is incorrect to say that Congress took away
all remedy under the lease. On the contrary, it gave
a new and more certain renmedy for a limited amount, in
lieu of an old remedy inefficient and uncertain in its
result. This is certainly not the taking of the landlord's
property without due process.
But we are told that if Congress determined to admit
landlords' claims to a share in debtors' assets it was

454

299 U. S.

bound by the Fifth Amendment not to be arbitrary in
the allotment of such share or to discriminate between
landlords and other creditors and between individual
landlords. We cannot pronounce the limit set upon petitioners' claim arbitrary or unreasonable. It is well
known that leases of business properties, particularly
retail business properties, commonly run for long terms.
The longer the term the greater the uncertainty as to the
loss entailed by abrogation of the lease. Testimony as
to present rental value partakes largely of the character
of prophesy and, although that value is the cardinal factor in the measure of damages for which petitioners contend, it is obvious that, since the landlord is not bound to
relet the premises for the unexpired term of the lease,
that factor may have little real bearing upon the realities
of the case. And, in any event, the possibility of the
landlord's using the premises for his own purposes, their
sale, their condemnation for public use, or their loss by
foreclosure, renders an estimate of present rental value
highly uncertain. Add to this the fact that bankruptcies
multiply in hard times, and that estimates of rental value
are made upon the basis of what a new tenant will pay
in an era of economic depression, and the estimate becomes even more unreliable. Whatever courts, in the absence of a statutory formula, might feel compelled to adopt
as the measure of damage' in such a case, we cannot hold
that Congress could not reasonably find that an award
of the full difference between rental value and rent reserved for the remainder of the term smacks too much
of speculation and that a uniform limit upon landlords'
clains will, in the long run, be fair to them, to other
creditors, and to the debtor.
The petitioners insist that the amount to which the
c!aiin must be limited has no reasonable relation to the
facts; 'hat a sum equal to three times the annual rent
can have no relation to the probable loss by the ending

KUEHNER v. IRVING TRUST CO.

Opinion of the Court.

of the leasehold.. But the rent reserved, broadly speaking,
has some relationship to the value of the property and
the value of a lease thereon. What the statute does, is to
assure at least three full years' rent to a landlord whose
possible loss may exceed that amount, evidently upon
the theory that with such an allowance the landlord
stands a reasonable chance of restoring himself to as good
a position as if the lease had not been terminated.
The petitioners say that by limiting their claim they
are put upon a different basis from other creditors. A
sufficient ground for the distinction is that petitioners get
back their property. In other words, they have lost
merely a bargain for the use of real estate, whereas merchandise creditors, lenders, and others, recover in specie
none of the property or money which passed from them
to the debtor.
Finally, it is said that the statute is whimsical and arbitrary in that the'limit fixed upon landlords' claims necessarily represents a varying proportion of the actual loss
of individual landlords and that this is discrimination of
the most obvious sort. If, however, the statute does not
deal unfairly with the petitioners-it does not lie in their
mouths'to object because someone else perchance will;
receive a larger proportion of his ultimate loss as the same'
is ascertained years hence than will the petitiohers. Congress, not unreasonably, felt that it was necessary, in the
interest of expedition of proof and allowance of landlords'
claims, which -had never theretofore been permitted to
share in a bankrupt debtor's assets, to fix a reasonable
limit. upon such claims. Naturally the amount fixed
cannot bear the same relation to the ultimate loss or damage in every case. But it does not follow that, for this
reason, all effort at uniformity of treatment of a peculiar
clasd of claims, difficult of liquidation, is doomed to condemnation. All the arguments which petitioners submit
would equally apply to any general and uniform formula

for the limitation of such claims which the Congress

unconstitutional as to them.
