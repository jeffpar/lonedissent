OCTOBER TERM, 1936.

WOOLSEY v. BEST, WARDEN.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO.

No. 256.

Jurisdictional statement distributed September 10, 1936.Decided October 12, 1936.

1. Where there has been a trial for a statutory offense in a state
court having jurisdiction, and conviction has been affirmed by the
Supreme Court of the State, the party convicted has no federal
right to attack the judgment collaterally in the state courts by
raising in habeas corpus a federal question concerning the validity
of the statute defining the offense, which was not raised, but could
have been raised, in the earlier proceedings. P. 2.
2. An appeal from a state court will be dismissed if it does not
appear that the decision complained of was not based upon an
adequate non-federal ground. Id.
Appeal dismissed.

Mr. Thomas H. Gibson was on the brief for appellant.
Mr. Byron Rogers, Attorney General of Colorado, and
Messrs. Charles Roach, Walter F. Scherer, and Pierpont
Fuller, Jr., Assistant Attorneys General, were on the brief
,for appellee.

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S

of ยง 2676 C. L. 1921, being ยง 40, c. 44, Session Laws 1913,
of the laws of Colorado (see also ยง 2740 C. L. 1921, being
ยง 85, c. 44 of Session Laws of 1913), the judgment of conviction having been affirmed by the Supreme Court of
the State. Woolsey v. People, 98 Colo. 62; 53 P. (2d) 596.
It is well established that the writ of habeas corpus
cannot be used as a writ of error. This is the rule in Colorado as well as in this Court. The judgment of conviction was not subject to collateral attack. People ex rel.
Burchinell v. District Court, 22 Colo. 422; 45 Pac. 402;
Martin v. District Court, 37 Colo. 110, 115; 86 Pac. 82;
Chemgas v. Tynan, 51 Colo. 35; 116 Pac. 1045; In re
Arakawa, 78 Colo. 193, 196; 240 Pac. 940; In re Nottingham, 84 Colo. 123, 128; 268 Pac. 587. Compare Harlan
v. McGourin, 218 U. S. 442; Riddle v. Dyche, 262 U. S.
333; Craig v. Hecht, 263 U. S. 255, 277; Knewel v. Egan,
268 U. S. 442, 445, 446; Cox v. Colorado, 282 U. S. 807.
It is apparent from the record submitted that the state
court had jurisdiction to try the appellant for violation of
the statute in question and that any federal question properly raised as to the validity of the statute could have been
heard and determined on appeal to this Court from the
final judgment in that action. The Supreme Court of
the State was not required by the Federal Constitution
to entertain such questions on the subsequent petition
for habeas corpus, and it does not appear that its denial
of the petition did not rest upon an adequate non-federal
ground. Lynch v. New York, 293 U. S. 52, and cases
there cited. The appeal is dismissed for the want of
jurisdiction.
Dismissed.
