That was an entirely adequate ground for sustaining
the decree of the District Court without attempting to
determine the constitutional validity of sub-section (b)
(5). Quite apart from that question, upon which we express no opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming that of the District Court, should in turn
be

IN

THE MATTER OF 620 CHURCH STREET
BUILDING CORP. ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 271.

Argued October 23, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.

1. A judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals declining jurisdiction of an appeal from an order of the District Court confirming a plan of reorganization under § 77 B of the Bankruptcy
Act, held reviewable by certiorari under § 262 of the Judicial
Code. P. 26.
2. Section 262, Jud. Code, permits the employment of the writ of
certiorari in cases not covered by § 240 and affords ample authority
for using the writ as an auxiliary process and as a means of giving
full force in( effect to existing appellate authority and of furthering justice in other kindred ways. Id.
3. In reorganization proceedings under § 77 B of the Bankruptcy
Act, only claims having some value are entitled to "adequate
protection." P. 27.
4. If no substantial question of law is presented, a refusal by the
Circuit Court of Appeals to allow an appeal from an order confirming a plan of reorganization under § 77 B, supra, is not an abuse
of discretion. Id.
5. A constitutional argument with no showing of injury is unavailing.
Id.
81 F. (2d) 463, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Theodore E. Rein and Isaac M. Mills for

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
In this proceeding undei § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act,
the District Court confirmed a plan of reorganization.
Petitioners asked the Circuit Court of Appeals to allow an
.appeal upon the ground that the plan was .unfair and
inequitable and deprived them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Bankruptcy Act, §§ 24 (b), 77B (k); Meyer v.
Kenmore Hotel Co., 297 U. S. 160, 165, 166. Leave to
appeal was denied. In view of an asserted conflict with
the decision of this Court in Louisville Joint Stock Land

Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in Tennessee Publishing Co. v. American National Bank, 81 F.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

Although the Circuit Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction, its action may properly be reviewed upon a writ
of certiorari under the general power conferred by Judicial Code, § 262. 28 U. S. C. 377. That provision contemplates the employment of this writ in instances not
covered by § 240 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. 347),.
and affords ample authority for using the writ as an auxiliary process and as a means "of giving full force and
effect to existing appellate authority and of furthering
justice in other kindred ways." United States v. Beatty,
232 U. S. 463, 467; American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. Ry. Co., 148 U. S. 372, 379, 380; In re
Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443, 461, 462; Magnum Import Co.
v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159, 162.
The record presents the petition for appeal and the
order confirming the plan of reorganization. It appears
that the principal property of the debtor, the 620 Church
Street Building Corporation, consists of certain leaseholds and improvements known as the Carlson Building
Annex. The allowed claims include first mortgage bonds
of $445,500 upon which interest is due from January,
1931, second mortgage notes for $40,250, with interest
from December, 1929, and a third mortgage note for
$27,000, with interest from December, 1931. Petitioners
.are the debtor, the holders of the second and third mortgages, and stockholders.
The order of confirmation sets forth the findings of the
District Court that the property in question has a fair
market value of $245,025 and that there is no equity over
and above the $445,500 of the first mortgage bonds; that
the debtor is insolvent; that the ,claims of the junior
lienors, the holderg" of the second and third mortgages,
are of no value and hence that no securities or cash should
be distributed under the plan in respect to their claims;
that stockholders are not entitled to participate in the

Opinion of the Court.

plan; and that the plan is "fair, equitable, and feasible
and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class
or classes of creditors or stockholders."
The evidence before the District Court is not presented
by the record. And as the Court of Appeals, if the appeal had been allowed, could have revised the ruling of
the court below only in matter of law, it necessarily folb
lows--and was conceded at the bar-that petitioners are
,bound by the findings of fact. Petitioners insist that their
consent to the plan of reorganization was necessary or
that their claims should have been accorded "adequate
protection." But the adequate protection to which the
statute refers is "for the realization of the value of the
interests, claims or liens" affected. Here the controlling
-finding is not only that there was no equity in the property above the first mortgage but that petitioners' claims
were appraised by the court as having "no value." There
was no value to be protected. This finding embraces
whatever interests petitioners may have as junior lienors
under the Illinois law and, in the same aspect, the constitutional argument is unavailing as petitioners have not
shown injury. Southern Ry. Co. v. King, 217 U. S. 524,
534; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, 225 U. S. 540,
550; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531,
544, 545; Heald v. District of Columbia, 259 U. S. 114,
123.
The Circuit Court of Appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow an appeal.
Affirmed.
