SERRA v. MORTIGA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
No. 202.

Submitted February 1, 1907.-Decided February 25, 1907.

The guarantees extended by Congress to the Philippine Islands are to be
interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant when Congress
made them applicable to those islands.
While a complaint on a charge of adultery under the Penal Code of the
Philippine Islands may be fatally defective for lack of essential averments as to place and knowledge on the part of the man that the woman
was married, objections of that nature must be taken at the trial, and
if not taken, and the omitted averments are supplied by competent
proof, it is not error for the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands
to refuse to sustain such objections on appeal.
While the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands hears an appeal as a
trial de novo and has power to reexamine the law and the facts it does
so entirely on the record.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

delivered the opinion of the court.

Articles 433 and 434, found in chapter 1 of title IX of the
Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, define and punish thb
crime of adultery. The articles referred to are in the margin.'
1 ART. 433. Adultery shall be punished with the penalty of prisi6n correccional in its medium and maximum degrees.

Opinion of the Court.

204 U. S.

It is conceded at bar that, under the Philippine law, the
offense of adultery, as defined by the articles in question, is
classed-as a private offense, and must be prosecuted, not on
information by the public prosecutor, but by complaint on
behalf of an injured party. In the Court of First Instance of
Albay, Eighth Judicial District, Philippine Islands, Adriano
Mortiga, the defendant in error, as the husband of Maria
Obleno, filed a complaint charging her with adultery committed with Vicente Serra, the other plaintiff in error,. who
was also charged. The complaint is in the margin.1
Aduiltery is committed by a married woman who lies with a man not her
husband, and by him who lies with her knowing that she is married,although
the marriage be afterwards declared void.
ART. 434. No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery except
upon the complaint of the aggrieved husband.
The latter can enter a complaint against both guilty parties, if alive, and
never, if he has consented to the adultery or pardoned either of the culprits.

SERRA v. MORTIGA.
204 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The defendants were arraigned, pleaded ,t guilty, were
tried by the court without a jury and were onvicted. The
court stated' its reasons in a written opinion, analyzing the
testimony and pointing out that all the essential ingredients
of the crime of adultery, as defined by the articles of the penal
code already referred to, were shown to have been committed.
The accused were sentenced to pay one-half of the costs and
to imprisonment for two years, four months and one day.
The record does not disclose that any objection was taken
.to the sufficiency of the complaint before the trial. Indeed,
it does not appear that by objection in any form, directly or
indirectly, was any question raised in the trial court concerning* the sufficiency of the complaint. An appeal was taken
to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. In that court
error was assigned on the ground, first, that "the complaint
is null and void because it lacks the essential requisite provided by law;" and second and third, because it did not appear from the proof that guilt had been established beyond
a reasonable doubt. The conviction was affirmed. The
assignment of error, which was based on the contention that
the conviction was erroneous because the complaint did not
sufficiently state the essential ingredients of the offense charged,
was thus disposed of by the court in its opinion: "The objections to the complaint, based upon an insufficient statement
of the facts constituting the offense, cannot be considered here,
because they were not presented in the court below. United
States v. Sarabia, 3 Off. Gaz. No. 29."
The assignments, based on the insufficiency of the proof to
show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, were disposed of by an
analysis of the evidence which the court deemed led to the
conclusion that all the statutory elements of the crime were
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. An application for a
rehearing, styled an exception, was made, in which it was.
insisted that it was the duty of the court to consider the assignment based on the insufficiency of the complaint, since not
to do so would be a denial of due process of law. The rehear-

ing was refuse lnd the sentence imposed below was increased
to tle years, Qxmonths and twenty-nine days, on the ground
that this was the minimum punishment provided for the
offense.
The errors assigned on this writ of error and the propositions
urged at bar to support them are confined to the assertion
that the refusal of the court below to consider the assignment
of error concerning the insufficiency of the complaint amounted
to a conviction of the accused without informing them of the
nature and. character of the offense with which they were.
charged, and was besides equivalent to a conviction without
due process of law. It is settled that by virtue of the bill
of rights enacted by Congress for the Philippine Islands, 32
Stat. 691, 692, that guarantees equivalent to the due process
and equal protection of the law clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, the twice in jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the substantial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment,
exclusive of the right to trial by jury, were extended to the
Philippine Islands. It is further settled that the guarantees
which Congress has extended to the Philippine Islands are
to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant
at the time when Congress made them applicable to the Philippine Islands.

Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100.

For the purpose, therefore, of passing on the errors assigned
we must test the correctness of the action of the court below
by substantially the same criteria which we would apply to a
case arising in the United States and controlled by the bill of
rights expressed in the amendments to the Constitution of the
United States. Turning to the text of the articles of the
Philippine penal code upon which the prosecution was based, it
will be seen that an essential ingredient of the crime of adultery,
as therein defined, is knowledge on the part of the man charged
of the fact that the woman with Whom the adultery was committed was a married woman. Turning to the complaint upon
which the prosecution was begun, it will be at once seen that
it was deficient, because it did not specify the place where the

Opinion of the Court.

crime was committed, nor does it expressly state that Vicente
Serra, the accused man, knew that Maria Obleno, the woman
accused, was at the time of the guilty cohabitation a married
woman. It results that there were deficiencies in the complaint which, if raised in any form in the trial court before
judgment, would have required the trial court to hold that the
complaint was inadequate. But the question for decision is
not whether the complaint, which was thus deficient, could
have been sustained, in view of the Constitutional guarantees,
if a challenge as to its sufficiency had been presented in any
form to the trial court before final judgment, but whether,
when no such challenge was made in the trial court before
judgment, a denial of the guarantees of the statutory bill of
rights arose from the action of the appellate court in refusing
to entertain an objection to the sufficiency of the complaint
because no such ground was urged in the trial court. Thus
reducing the case to the real issue enables us to put out of
view a number of decisions of this court referred to in the
margin,1 as well as many decided cases of state courts referred
to in the brief of counsel, because they are irrelevant, since
all the former and, if not all, certainly all of the latter, concern
the soundness of objections made in the trial court, by the
accused, to the sufficiency of indictments or informations.
In Ex parte Parks, 93 U. S. 18, the case was this: The petitioner Parks applied to this court for a writ of habeas corpus.
He had been convicted and sentenced for the crime of forgery
in a District Court of the United States. The ground relied
upon for release was that the indictment stated no offense.
The writ was discharged. Speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, it was said:
"But the question whether it was not a crime within the
statute was one which the District Court was competent to
decide. It was before the court and within its jurisdiction.

"Whether an act charged in an indictment is or is not a
crime by the law which the court administers [in this case the
statute law of the United States], is a question which has to be
met at almost every stage of criminal proceedings; on motions

to quash the indictment, on demurrers, on motions to arrest
judgment, etc. The court may err, but it has jurisdiction of
the question. If it errs, there is no remedy, after final judgment, unless a writ of error. lies to some superior court, and
no such writ lies in this case."
In United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, an attempt was made
to prosecute for the second time one Millard H. Ball, who had
been acquitted upon a defective indictment, which had been
held bad upon the proceedings in error prosecuted by. others,
who had been convicted and who had been jointly prosecuted
with Ball. Reversing the court below, the plea of autrefois
acquit, relied on by Ball, was held good. It was pointed out
that the acquittal of Ball upon the defective indictment was
not void, and, therefore, the acquittal on such. an indictment
was a bar. This case was apprQvingly cited in Kepner v.
United States, 195 U. S. 100, 129. It being then settled that
the conviction on a defective indictment is not void, but presents a mere question of error to be reviewed according to
law, the proposition to be decided is this: Did thq court below
err in holding that it would not consider whether the trial
court erred because it had not decided the complaint to be
bad, when no question concerning its sufficiency .was either
directly or indirectly made in that court? Thus to understand the proposition is to refute it. For it cannot be that
t he court below was wrong in refusing to consider whether the
trial court erred in a matter which that court was not-called
upon to consider and did not decide. Undoubtedly, if a judgment of acquittal had resulted it would have barred a further
prosecution, despite the defective indictment. Kepner v.
United States, supra.
But it is said the peculiar powers of the Supreme Court in

v. MORTIGA.

Opinion of the Court.

the Philippine Islands take this case out of the general rule,
since in that court on appeal a trial de novo is had even in a
criminal case. But as pointed out in the Kepner case, whilst
that court on appeal has power to re~xamine the law and facts,
it does so on the record and does not retry in the fullest sense.
Indeed, when the power of the court below to review the facts
is considered that power, instead of sustaining, refutes the
proposition relied on. Thus the proposition is that the court
should have reversed the conviction because of the contention
as to the insufficiency of the complaint, when no such question
had been raised before final judgment in the trial court, and
when, as a necessary consequence of the facts found by the
court, the testimony offered at the trial without objection or
question in any form established every essential ingredient
of the crime. In other words, the contention is that reversal
should have been ordered for an error not committed and when
the existence of injury was impossible to be conceived, in view
of the opinion which the court formed on the facts in the exercise of the authority vested in it on that subject.
