CITY OF CLEVELAND v. CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
Nos. 197. 321.

Argued November 12, 13, 1906.-Decided January 7, 1907.

Grants of franchises are usually prepared by those interested in them and
submitted to the legislatures with a view to obtain the most liberal
grant obtainable, and for this and other reasons ,such grants should be in
plain language, certain, definite in nature, and contain no ambiguity in
their terms, and -will be strictly construed against the grantee. Blair
v. Chicago, 200 U. S. 400, 471.
The Ohio legislature has granted the city of Cleveland comprehensive
power to contract with street railroad companies with regard to the use
of its streets and length of time, not exceeding twenty-five years, for
which such franchise may be granted. Cleveland v. City Railway Co.,
194 U. S. 517; Cleveland v. Electric Railway Co., 201 U. S. 529.
The action of the city council of Cleveland, and the acceptance by the
Cleveland Electric Railway Company of the various ordinances adopted
by the council did not amount to a contract between the city and the
company extending the time of the franchise involved in this action;
and a later ordinance affecting that franchise after its expiration as
originally granted is not void under the impairment clause of the Federal
Constitution.
In the absence of any provision to that effect in the original franchise, the
city granting a franchise to a street railway company, cannot on the
expiration of the franchise take possession of the rails, poles and operating

appliances; they are property belonging to the original owner, and an
ordinance granting that property to another company on payment to
the-owner of a sum to be adjudicated as its value is void as depriving the
owner of its property without due process of law.

THIs bill was fied in the United States Circuit Court for the
Northern District of Ohio on the twenty-first of March, 1905,
against the City of Cleveland- and The Forest City Railway
Company, for the purpose of obtaining an injunction to restrain
the city from carrying out a certain ordinance relating to the
Garden street branch of complainant's railroad, passed by the
city council January 11, 1904, on the ground that it was null
and void, because it impaired the obligations of various contracts which the complainant alleged had been entered into
"between the complainant and the city, providing for the use
until either July 13, 1913, or July 1, 1914, of certain streets by
the railroad owned by the complainant, and known as the Garden street or Central avenue branch, and hereafter called the
Garden street btanch. The ordinance granted to The Forest
City Railway Company (a stranger to the original grants) the
renewal right to maintain and operate the existing street railroads through the streets named therein, which were the same
streets theretofore granted to the Garden street railroad. The
right was granted upon condition that the grantee should pay
to the owners of the poles and other property being in the streets
an amount to be agreed upon therefor, or such sum as should be
finally adjudicated upon by a court. A temporary restraining
order was granted. The defendants made separate answers,
denying the existence of any contract between the complainant
and the city upon the subject of the Garden. street branch subsequent to March 22, 1905, and the Forest City Railway Company
claimed under the ordinance of January, 1904, the right to
take possession of such Garden street branch after March, 1905,
and to use the tracks of the complainant's railroad. The case
was heard upon the pleadings and various ordinances and resolutions of the council of the city.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Statement of the Case.

204 U. S.

After hearing, a decree was made by the Circuit Court (137
Fed. Rep. 111), which decreed that the right claimed by the
complainant to operate its Garden street branch railroad in the
streets named in the bill expired on the twenty-second day of
March, 1905. It was also decreed that the ordinance of January 11, 1904, was inoperative, so far as it assumed to confer
upon the defendant, The Forest City Railway Company, any
legal right to take the tracks, poles, wires and appliances erected
and maintained by the complainant in the streets, because such
ordinance authorized -lte taking of the property of complainant
without due process of law. The railroad company, therefore,
was enjoined from interfering with the complainant in the peaceable possession*of the property mentioned, and the city was
enjoined from attempting in any manner, by virtue of the
ordinance, to put the defendant, The Forest City Railway
Company, into possession of the same. From the decree the
complainant, and both of the defendants, appealed directly to
this court, as involving questions arising under the Constitution
of the United States. The complainant's appeal is No. 197,
and is from that portion of the decree which adjudges that the
right of the complainant to maintain and operate its Garden
street branch railroad expired on the twenty-second of March,
1905. The cross appeal of the defendants is from that portion
of the decree which enjoins The Forest City Railway Company
from taking possession of the property described, and which
also enjoins the city from in any manner attempting to put that
company into possession thereof. It thus appears that the
whole controversy turns upon the question whether the right of
the Garden street railroad terminated March 22, 1905, or lasts
until July 1, 1914, or possibly only until July 13, 1913.
The record shows that there are, among others, two lines of
railroad belonging to the complainant, one of which is known
as the Euclid avenue, sometimes called the "main" line, and
the other the Garden street branch. Both lines run from east
to west through the city in different, though generally parallel,
streets up to the point of their intersection at Erie street and

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 119
204 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Euclid avenue (or Prospect street), from which point west, for.
a short distance, to the public square and Water street, the Garden street branch is authorized to use the Euclid avenue. tracks.
The following (among many other) ordinances and resolutions
of the council of the city were put in evidence on the trial, together with the various resolutions of complainant, in which it
accepted such ordinances and resolutions. These constitute
the case between the parties, and there is no contradictory evidence. Complainant contends that the Garden street grant
must be measured in time by that provided for the termination
of the Euclid avenue grant.
The ordinances and resolutions relating to the Euclid avenue
line will be first stated. The first is a resolution, which granted
to the East Cleveland Railroad Company, a corporation incorporated February 28, 1859, for that purpose, the right to construct and operate a railroad from a point on Prospect street
at its intersection with Erie street, to the eastern terminus of
Prospect street, which grant was for the term of twenty years
from September 20, 1859. The company having obtained the
necessary consents of the property owners along the line, duly
located, constructed and operated the road under that resolution and within a short time after it was authorized so to do.
This was the commencement of what is known as the Euclid
avenue, or sometimes (after 1868) the main line of one of the
roads owned now by the complainant.
By ordinance, April 15, 1862, the company was authorized
to extend its line from the intersection of Erie and Euclid streets
west to the public square.
September 15, 1879, an ordinance was passed, which granted
a renewal of the franchise to the East Cleveland Railroad Company to maintain and operate its whole Euclid avenue street
railroad as far as Willson avenue, on the east, for a period of
twenty-five years from September 20, 1879, (September 20,
1904). This ordinance makes no reference to the Garden street
line, which had then been built and was in operation, and does
not mention any of the streets through which that line passed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.

204 U. S.

although the Garden street line had the right, under the ordinance of 1868, hereinafter mentioned, to use the tracks of the
Euclid avenue line from the point of junction therewith westerly
to its terminus.
On the fourth of April, 1883, another ordinance was passed,
granting to the East Cleveland Railroad Company the right to
extend, lay and operate its double track on Euclid avenue from
the west line of Willson avenue easterly to the east line of Fairmount street, the right granted to terminate on the twentieth
of September, 1904, "with the said renewal of that part of said
company's line lying west of Willson avenue." Ordinance of
September 15, 1879, above referred to.
By ordinance of March 15, 1886, another grant was made to
the Euclid avenue line east of Fairmount street, which grant
was to cease and terminate upon the twentieth of September,
1904, "as provided for said company's tracks in Euclid avenue,
west of Fairmount street."
In order to change from animal power to electricity an ordinance was passed July 13, 1888, granting to the East Cleveland
Street Railway Company the right to construct and operate an
electric street railway on Euclid avenue from Willson avenue
easterly to the city limits, and on Cedar avenue from a point
near the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railway Company's right of
way in that avenue, easterly to a point about 1,500 feet east of
Fairmount street. The permission was given on the condition
that the grant was to be exercised within six months from the
passage of the ordinance. The grant was also upon condition
that if the company, from any cause, should fail to extend the
electric system over its entire main and Cedar avenue lines
within eighteen months from the d ate of the passage of the
ordinance, then the ordinance should be void. Nothing in the
ordinance was to be construed as authorizing any increase in
the fare for transportation over any portion of the company's
line. The sixth section of the ordinance stated that the privilege of constructing the electric system, as provided in the ordinance, was granted "in consideration of the improved facilities

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 121
204 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

hereby contemplated and the large expenditures necessary to
secure the same, and shall be in force for the period of twentyfive years from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance, upon its main and Cedar avenue lines." The right to
change to electric power, as given by the foregoing ordinance,
was confined, it will be observed, to that portion of the Euclid
avenue line east of Willson avenue, and on Cedar avenue to
that part lying between the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railway
Company's right of way and a point 1,500 feet east of Fairmount
street. Nothing west of Willson avenue is included in that
grant.
On May 13, 1889, a resolution was adopted, which authorized and required the railroad company, "as soon as practicable, to extend the use of such motive power over its main and
Cedar avenue lines to the westerly termini thereof." This included those lines west of.Willson avenue, and under the ordinance and resolution the Euclid avenue line was changed to
an electric street railroad within the times mentioned in the
ordinance and resolution.
There was no extension of time granted by the resolution of
1889 for the termination of the grant on any portion of the
Euclid avenue line.
On July 17, 1893, the right was given to the
company to extend its road at the intersection of Prospect and Erie streets to
the intersection of Prospect and Ontario streets, and also at the
intersection of Superior and Seneca streets, thence along
Seneca, Lake and Ontario streets, and the council imposed
upon it the duty, if required by the council, of operating its
cars over the entire length of any of the lines. Other duties
were imposed upon it. Complainant contends that some part
of this ordinance refers to a portion of the Garden street extension, and that it requires the operation of all the Garden street
cars over these tracks, and the grant is to terminate at the time
mentioned in the 1888 ordinance, July 13, 1913.
The above list includes the material ordinances and resolutions pertaining particularly to Euclid avenue.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Statement of the Case.

204 U. 'S.

After the Euclid avenue line had been built the couneil, on
the fourteenth of January, 1868, passed a resolution granting
its consent to the East Cleveland Street Railroad Company to
lay down its tracks from the intersection of Prospect and Brownell streets, "to connect with the main line of its railroad,"
running thence through Garden and other streets to and across
Willson avenue, to the eastern boundary of the city, during the
period of twenty years. Willson avenue was then the eastern
boundary of the city. The road could continue to use and
occupy the streets, avenues and public grounds, over which its
main line was then constructed and operated westerly from
the junction (at Brownell and Prospect streets) of said road
with the main line to its westerly terminus, for the same length
of time.
This Garden street line-was thereafter built, and it is asserted
that it was the inception of a new and separate street railroad.
It has been extended at various times since, and forms, with its
various extensions, what is called the Garden street branch,
and is the railroad in question.
On the thirtieth of March, 1868, the railroad company was
permitted by ordinance of the village of East Cleveland to construct a branch railroad on Garden street,. which would form an
extension, in fact, of the Garden street line easterly through
the village to the line of Wade street. The grant was for
twenty years from the time of the completion of the work,
which was to be completed within five years from the date of
the passage of the resolution granting the right, March 30,
1868.
On the twenty-fifth of March, 1873, the council passed a resolution, in the preamble of which it was stated that the East
Cleveland Railroad Company desired and proposed to connect
their Garden street branch with the main line of their road, at
the intersection of Erie and Prospect streets, and thereupon
the council granted to the railroad company the "right to lay
down a double track street railroad in Ohio street from their
present track in Brownell street to Erie street, and in Erie street

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 123
204 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

from Ohio street to Prospect street, to connect with their main
track at this point." This made a junction at Erie and Prospect streets, with the Euclid Avenue Railroad, instead of at
Brownell and Prospect streets, a small difference as to length
of road.
On the twenty-third of May, 1876, the council authorized
the East Cleveland Railroad Company to extend the Garden
street branch of its road at the easterly end thereof along Garden street to Baden avenue, thence to Quincy, along Quincy to
New, and along New street to Garden street, there to connect
with the Garden street tracks. The ordinance provided that
the right therein granted should continue for twenty years from
that date.
This extension placed a track in Quincy street from Baden
to New street, which was a very short distance. It did make
a different date for the termination of the grant than was provided for the rest of the branch, and it was to be operated "in
connection with said branch and its main line." No increase
of fare was to be charged by the company on any part of its
branch or of its main line or extension by reason of the extension.
In the year 1880, on the twenty-second of March, the council
passed an ordinance authorizing the East Cleveland Railroad
Company to extend the Garden street branch of its railway,
from the then existing track, at the intersection of Baden avenue and Quincy street, on and along said Quincy street, in an
easterly direction to the intersection of Quincy street and Lincoln avenue, "and to equip and operate the said extension and
its Garden street branch for the period of twenty-five years from
and after the passage of the ordinance." When this ordinance
was passed the eastern'limits of the city of Cleveland had been
extended, so that the territory covered by the grants to the
Garden street line was at that time included in the city of Cleveland.
In 1885, February 9, the council passed an ordinance permitting the East Cleveland Railroad Company "to extend its

and equip and operate said extension as a

single track railroad, with all necessary switches, turnouts and
turntables" in connection with said branch and its main line,
and terminating with the grant for the main line, but with the
express condition that "no increase of fare shall be charged by
said company on any part of its main line, or on said extension,
by reason of said extension."
On the seventeenth of June, 1887, the council granted another extension to the Garden street branch, on Garden street
from Baden avenue easterly to Lincoln avenue, the grant to
terminate "with the grant for the Garden street main line,"
and no extra fare.
1 On the tenth of March, 1890, the council passed an ordinance
which "granted the right to operate its Garden street branch
by electricity" from and to the points named in the ordinance,
and this grant was "to operate by electric power the said Garden street branch during the term of its present grant for said
Garden street branch." Both roads were thereafter operated
as electric street railroads.
On the thirtieth day of March, 1891, another ordinance was
passed, authorizing the railroad company "to operate a second
or additional track in and upon Central avenue (Garden street)
from the east line of Willson avenue to the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad tracks." It was provided that the "right herein
granted shall be valid until the expiration of the grants for the
said company's main line."
On the twentieth of April, 18917 an ordinance was passed
which authorized the railroad company to "operate a second
or additional track in and upon Quincy street from New street
to Woodland Hills avenue." This was part of the Garden
street line. Section 3 of the ordinance contained the provision
that the "right herein granted shall be valid until the expiration
of the grants for said company's tracks on said Quincy street
east of Lincoln avenue, to wit, July 13, 1913."

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 125
204 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

These are the material ordinances which particularly relate
to the Garden street railroad.
During March and April, 1893, the complainant herein was
organized as a consolidation of several street railroads, which,
it is enough to say, included, among others, the Euclid avenue
and the Garden street lines, and on the twenty-second day of
May, 1893, the consolidated railroad company .(this complainant), through its vice-president, addressed a communication to
the council, stating that the various consolidations had been
made under advice of counsel, but inasmuch as some question
seemed to have arisen as to the intention of the company, it
was stated that the company did not claim any rights greater
than the constituent companies forming the organization;
that it intended to obey all ordinances to which each and all
the constituent companies were subject, and that it had, since
the consolidation had been effected, issued transfer checks to
all persons desiring them, to enable such persons to have a continuous ride from any East Side line.to any South Side or West
Side- line, and from any South or West Side line of the company
to any East Side line, for one fare, and would continue such system of transfers where it could not better accommodate its patrons by such through lines as it might establish; and that it
disclaimed all intention of charging more than one fare for any
such continuous ride; "and that its aim has been and will be to
give its patrons vastly improved service and accommodations
by reason of such consolidation."
The council thereupon, by resolution, consented .to the consolidation'of -the various, railroad companies named in the resolution under the name of the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, upon the condition that ' only one fare shall be charged
for a continuous ride -onor over any line of railway formerly
owned by any other of said constituent companies within the
limits of the city of Cleveland; and passengers on any of such
lines paying one fare shall be entitled, without extra or additional charge, to be transferred to any other of said lines and
have a continhous ride thereon for said single fare." The con-

ditions contained in the resolution were thereafter accepted by
the complainant in writing.
On the nineteenth day of February, 1894, the council adopted
"an ordinance granting permission to the Cleveland Electric
Railway and the Cleveland City Railway Company to extend
their tracks in Willson avenue." This avenue runs north and
south and crosses many of the avenues in which some of the
constituent companies of the consolidated road had laid their
tracks.
The ordinance granted each railroad company the right to
extend its double track railroad along Willson avenue from
and to the various points named in the ordinance, and the road
was to be constructed and operated in connection with the existing tracks in Willson avenue as a double track street railroad.
The two companies named in the ordinance were to jointly
construct and maintain the road, and each was to have the right
to occupy and use. the track, wires, etc., of the other company
then in Willson avenue, on such terms and conditions as the
council might deem just and reasonable, unless the companies
should otherwise agree. Provision was then made for the running of through carson Willson avenue between certain points,
and night cars were to be operated by the companies throughout the entire length of Willson avenue. A passenger on any
car operated on any part of said Willson avenue was to have
the right, on the payment of one fare, without additional or extra charge, to be transferred to any other line of either of said
companies intersecting or coming to said Willson avenue, and
were to have a continuous ride thereon, with the right, without
additional charge, to be transferred from said second line to a
car on any other line of either of these companies intersecting
or coming to Willson avenue, and were to be entitled, without
additional or extra charge, to be transferred to the Willson avenue line and to have a continuous ride thereon. Regulations
were made for the paving of certain portions of the street by,
the company under the direction of the city authorities, and
provision was made for widening the roadway on Willson avenue

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 127

Argument for Cleveland Electric Railway Company.

between certain points named, and for setting back curbs, hydrants, etc., all of which was to be done at the expense of the
companies, which were also to comply with and perform all the
general ordinances of the city relating to street railroads, then
or thereafter in force. By.section 10 it was provided that the
grant should be in force until the first day of July, -1914.
On the twenty-fifth of June, 1894, the council passed "An
ordinance granting the Cleveland Electric Railway the right
to extend and operate its double track street railroad in Quincy
street from New street to Willson avenue.!' This ordinance
provided for the extension and operation by the Cleveland
Electric Railway Company of a double track street railroad on
and along Quincy street, from its then present tracks thereon,
westerly to Willson avenue, connecting by curves with its
Willson avenue tracks. The sixth section provided that "This
grant shall terminate with the grant for said company's present
line in Quincy street."
These ordinances and resolutions are those which particularly
relate to the extent of the grants to the railroad company for
the Euclid avenue and for the Garden street lines. Other ordinances and resolutions were passed, showing in connection with
those already in evidence, as insisted upon by the complainant,
the existence of a general systei for the operation of the roads
owned by the complainant, including the Euclid avenue and
Garden street lines, as a unit, and the necessity existing for operating all of the lines in connection with each other for the life
of the longest grant. And it is insisted that this was the obvious
intention of the council, to be gathered from the various ordinances, among them those especially above adverted to.
Mr. William B. Sanders and Mr. John W. Warrington, with
whom Mr. Andretb Squire was on the brief; for Cleveland
Electric Railway Company.
The Garden street tracks involved'were, and are extensions,
of the "main line" of the East Cleveland Railroad Company.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Argument for Cleveland Electric Railway Company.

204 U. S.

The grant for the "main line" does not expire before July 13,
1913, in fact not until July, 1914.
By consistent and uniform legislation, the council has provided that the Garden street extension should be operated
in connection with the "main line" and the right to operate
expires with the grants for the "main line." This is expressly so provided in the ordinance of 1885, and in two
ordinances in 1891.
In 1893 the council fixed the terms and conditions of the
consolidation forming the appellant. The grants of the constituent companies as then provided expired as follows: Broadway & Newburgh Co., July, 1914; the East Cleveland Co.,
July, 1913; the South Side Street Co., October, 1913; the
Brooklyn Street Co., January, 1910; and, as a condition of such
consolidation, the council required thereafter the operation as
an entire system of all the lines of the constituent companies,
with through car" service and general transfers. In order to
comply with these conditions and exercise the right granted
to the consolidated company, operation must be continued
until the expiration of the longest grant, to-wit, July, 1914.
In 1894 the council provided for the constfuction by the
Consolidated Company and The Cleveland City Railway Company of a cross-town line in Willson avenue, and for the operation of such line in connection with all of the lines of the Consolidated Company,- including the Garden street extension.
The operation so required of the Consolidated Company, the
ordinance provided, should continue until July, 1914,-this
being the date of expiration of the longest grant held by the
Consolidated Company. The conditions .of this cross-town
ordinance cannot be complied with, nor can the railway
company exercise the- rights there granted in consideration
of its expenditures in building the line, without the operation
of the Garden street extension to July, 1914.
The city received full consideration for these grants, and
the extensions were not for an unreasonable time: only for
such time as made the right to operate an extension track

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 129
204 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

expire at the same time as the "main line" of which it was
an extension, an(1 permitted operation in connection with the
cross-town line for'such period as was necessary to fulfill the
obligation and exercise the rights granted in the ordinance
establishing such cross-town line.
The right of the appellant to operate the Garden street
extension did not, as decreed below, expire in March, 1905;
but by virtue of existing contracts, which cannot be impaired,
appellant is entitled to operate the tracks in controversy until
July, 1914.
Mr. Newton D. Baker for the city of Cleveland.
Mr. D. C. Westenhaver for the Forest City Railway Company.
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
Out of these various ordinances and resolutions arise the
difficulties suggested in this case. The facts are somewhat
complicated by reason of their number, and the.inferences to be
drawn from them are not always perfectly plain and certain.
The complainant contends that, by reason of the action of the
city council and the acceptanc6 by the complainant of the various ordinances and resolutions adopted by that council, a
valid contract has been entered into between the city and the
complainant, by which the right to use the streets named in .the
ordinances by the Garden street branch has been granted to
complainant up to July 1, 1914, or, if it is mistaken as.to that
time, that then. the contract terminates on the thirteenth of
July, 1913. The city contends that neither date is right, but.
that the contract, so far as it related to the Garden street
branch, terminated on the twenty-second of March, 1905.
The rules of construction which have been adopted by courts
in cases of public grants of this nature by the authorities of
cities are of long standing. It has been held that such grants
should be in plain language, that they should be certain and

definite in their nature, and should contain no ambiguity in
their terms. The legislative mind must be distinctly impressed
with the unequivocal form of expression contained in the grant,
"in order that the privileges may be intelligently granted or
purposely withheld. It is matter of common knowledge that
grants of this character are usually prepared by those interested
in them, and submitted to the legislatures with a view to obtain
from such bodies the most liberal grant of privileges which they
are willing to give. This is-one among many reasons why they
are to be strictly construed." Blair v. Chicago, 201 U. S. 400,
471. In the case cited this court has had occasion to state the
principle of construction and to cite some of the authorities
upon which it is based. This has been so lately done that it is
unnecessary to more than refer to that case as authority for the
doctrine above stated.
Before proceeding with an examination of the various ordinances and resolutions referred to in the foregoing statement,
it is well to say that we do so upon the assumption that the
legislature has heretofore granted to the city council of Cleveland most comprehensive power to contract with street railroads within its limits, with regard to the use of its streets, and
the length of time for which such use may:be granted, not longer than twenty-five years. City of Cleveland v. Cleveland
City Railway Company, 194 U. S. 517, 533; Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric Railway Company, 201 U. S. 529, 541. Therefore,
in deciding this case, we assume the validity of the contract,
whatever it is, that was made. The only question involved
herein is one of construction and intent.
The most important of the many ordinances and resolutions
relating to the Euclid avenue line, commencing in 1859, have
been referred to in the foregoing statement of facts because of
the contention of complainant that the Garden street branch
is nothing but an extension and, in reality, as in law, a component part of the Euclid avenue line, and that the Garden
street grant is limited and governed by the time of the expiration of the Euclid avenue grant. In other words, that the grant

Opinion of the Court.

of 1888 to the Euclid avenue line of the right to change its motive power, and extending the termination of the grant until
twenty-five years from that (late, thereby extended the termination of the grant to the Garden street branch to the same
time, although the whole branch road had been separately and
otherwise provided for, and had never before had the same
termination as the Euclid avenue line. The grant is to be inplied which is to work such a change in a grant then existing
in specific and direct language. The same argument is also
set forth in regard to the ordinance of July 17, 1893, which
will be again referred to.
Under these circumstances it is important to direct special
attention to the Garden street branch.
The East Cleveland Railroad Company, having built and
operated its road through the various streets mentioned in the
ordinance of 1859, granting it leave so to do, became desirous
of building another road in connection with the one it was then
operating, but there was no statute at that time in Ohio permitting the extension of a road then built, and the company therefore in 1867, and the early part of 1868, took the same proceedings to acquire the right to build the new road that it had
taken to build the former, although it did not seek a new incorporation. As a railroad company already existing, it applied
to the council of the city of Cleveland for leave to construct a
street railroad from the intersection of Prospect and Brownell
streets, to connect with the main line of its road, and thence
through various streets and along the center of Garden street,
to and across Willson avenue, to the easterly boundary of the
city. It procured the consents of the property owners along
the line; notice for the reception of bids was published by
the city as provided for in the statute, and the railroad company made a formal bid for the privilege of laying down its
trWicks through the various streets, and named the rates of fare
which would be charged. That bid was the lowest, if not the
only one, made, and it was duly accepted, and the privilege
was granted t6 build a railroad in Garden street, and to operate

it for twenty years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance, January 14, 1868, and the company was to continue to
use the western end of the Euclid avenue road as stated in the
ordinance. The ordinance was accepted and the road built.
At this time the grant to the Euclid avenue line expired Septem°
ber 20, 1879.
Referring to the procedure under which the Garden street
branch was created and the permission of the city council to
build the road obtained, it is plain that the branch thus built
was not a mere extension or part of the Euclid avenue line, so
that a grant to the latter necessarily covered the other as an
inseparable part of it, but was a distinct line, with a separate
route, with the exception of a short distance at the west end,
where it was permitted to use the tracks of the Euclid avenue
line. The termination of the right was at a different time from
that provided for the Euclid avenue line. This use of the
Euclid avenue tracks for a short distance did not make the
Garden street branch a mere extension of the former road.
Whether authorized by its charter to build the Garden street
road is not important. It did so, and its right to do it was
given by an ordinance of the council, which has been recognized as valid ever since. Because on some occasions it has
been called a branch does not alter the weight to be given the
facts stated or turn the branch into a mere extension where it
has been otherwise uniformly treated.
It is contended that by the 'resolution of March 25, 1873,
which granted to the East Cleveland Railway Company the
right to lay a double track street railroad, intersecting with its
main line at Erie street and Prospect street, and thence through
other streets inentioned in the resolution, the Garden street
line thereby became an extension of the main line,. or was
recognized as a mere extension. The preamble to that resolution recites that the railroad company desires. to connect the
Garden street branch with the main line of their road at the intersection of Erie and Prospect streets, and to remove the other
track from Brownell street, between Ohio and Prospect streets,

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY.. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 133
204 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and therefore permission is granted to the company so to do.
That resolution provided simply for changing the connection
of the Garden street branch with the Euclid avenue line from
Brownell street to Erie street, and for the taking up of the track
on Brownell street, between Ohio and Prospect streets. It did
not make the Garden street branch any more of an extension
of the main line than it had been before. The branch road certainly did not become a part of the main road, simply because
it ran in connection with it, or because it ran over a small portion of the tracks of that road. It remained what it started
out as, a road with a separate route and a different term of life.
The grant made in 1876 to the company to extend its Garden
street tracks from its then terminus at Baden street, to and
along other streets towards the east, with the right to equip and
operate said extension for twenty years, in connection with the
said Garden street branch and its main line, had no effect upon
the question we are discussing. That extension of the tracks
of the Garden street branch spoken of in the ordinance was also
a short one, and was .to terminate at a different time from that
then existing in regard to the other portion of the Garden street
branch. That it was to be operated in connection with its Garden street branch and the main line did not make the branch
as extended a part of the main line, or alter the fact that the
branch was a separate road, although operated in connection
with the main line. It is quite difficult to see why the right to
operate this particular extension should have been granted for
twenty years or until 1896, instead of being limited to terminate
with the branch, but at any rate, the grant is in unambiguous
terms, and states in so many words the length of time it is to
last. Its importance is not very great, and is entirely effaced
by the subsequent ordinance of 1880, which provided for the
termination of the whole Garden street branch at the time
specified, 1905.
By that ordinance (March 22, 1880) the question of the termination of the grant for the whole Garden street branch was distinctly settled. By it the right to extend that branch of its

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.

204 U. S.

railroad in an easterly direction, on and along Quincy street,
was given to the company, and the right "to equip and operate
the said extension and its Garden street branch" was given
for the period of twenty-five years from the passage 'of the
ordinance, but without increase of fare on any portion. This,
of course, placed the termination of the whole grant to the Garden street branch on March 22, 1905. There is no ambiguity
as to this grant, and the termination of the grants to the two
roads was kept apart, one being September 20, 1904, the other
March 22, 1905.
Much stress is laid by the complainant on the ordinance of
the ninth of February, 1885, which was entitled "An ordinance
to permit the East Cleveland Railroad Company to extend the
Garden street branch of its railway." The company was
.'thereby authorized to extend the Garden street branch from
the intersection of Quincy street and Lincoln avenue, in an
easterly direction, to Woodland Hills avenue. It was to, be
operated in connection "with said branch and its main line
and terminating with the grant for the main, line," but with no
increase of fare. It is contended that- the particular grant
mentioned in this ordinance was to terminate with the grant
for the main line, which wou4d make it terminate September 20,
1904, instead of March 22, 1905. If this were the only question, of course the complainant would not insist that the grant
to it should be shortened six months. But it is cited for the
purpose of showing an intention of the council to limit the
termination of the Garden street branch by the limitation then
existing in regard to the Euclid avenue line. It is contended
that from the time of the passage of this ordinance by the council and its acceptance by the complainant the parties thereby
agreed that' the. extension should be operated with the main
line, and that its -grant for such operation should expire with
the grant for the main or Euclid -avenue line, and that this was
in pursuance of the plan by the city to have the- grants to the
two' roads expire at the same time. And the claim is that the
subsequent ordinances must be construed in the same manner

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 135
204 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and for the purpose of carrying out the same scheme. There is
here undoubtedly some room for the contention of complainant,
but we think, upon looking at all the facts in connection with
this question, that the intention of the council was not that
way. The Garden street branch, running from the intersection
of Erie and Prospect streets, towards the east, terminated, at
the time of this grant, at Lincoln avenue. This made a long
line of road. By the ordinance it was lengthened from Lincoln
avenue to Woodland Hills avenue, a comparatively short extension of track. The right granted to the whole branch line
as far east as Lincoln avenue then terminated on the twentysecond of March, 1905, and yet by this construction of the ordinance of 1885 this small extension of track from Lincoln avenue
to Woodland Hills avenue was to expire September 20, 1904.
Why this difference? The ordinance did not assume in any
way to alter the time of the termination of the then existing
grant to the rest of the Garden street branch, but it simply
limited the time of the termination of the grant for the extension then given. Hence it is difficult to see how any agreement
can be found to arise from the ordinance for the simultaneous
termination of all the grants to both the main line and the Garden street branch. Nor can any general scheme to have the
grants of both roads terminate together be evolved from anything done by the parties up to and including 1885.
There is nothing in Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric Railway,
201 U. S. 529, 539, that covers this case. The language of the
ordinance adverted to in that case is to be applied to very different facts from those existing here. We assume the ability
of the council to make such a contract as complainant contends
for herein, but we think none such was made in fact.
So far as can be determined from this record, there was absolutely no reason for terminating the right to use this small
extension of track in September, 1904, while the rest of the
branch then existing was not to terminate until six months Iater. It cut up the branch line in a way which it is impossible
from this record to give any reason for, and accordingly,,under

the then qxisting circumstances, it might be argued that the
words, "terminate with the grant for the main line," did not
mean the Euclid avenue line, but it referred to the Garden
street branch, which was, as a matter of' fact, the main line so
far as concerned the small extension of the track from Lincoln
avenue to Woodland Hills avenue. To terminate the grant for
the extension at the same. time- with the grant for the line
thereby extended would be the most 'obvious and natural
course to pursue. It is true the ordinance itself recognizes the
"branch and its main line" as constituting. two different lines,
and -provides that the grant is to terminate with the grant for
the main line. And yet the real meaning of the ordinance,
when regarded in the light of the facts then existing, becomes,
to say the least, ambiguous. The general provision for the termination of the grant for the whole Garden street branch, as
made in 1880, ought not to be expunged by an implication
arising out of such doubtful language as is found in this 1885
ordinance. But if 'otherwise, it results only that the particular
extension expired in September, 1904, with the grant to the
Euclid avenueline, which, at that period, expired- on that
date.
In 1887p-June 17, an extension of the Garden street branch
was granted, which, by the terms of the ordinance, was to terminate "with the grant for the Garden street maui line," without increase of fare being charged. Here the council i it will be
observed, expressly referred to the'Garden street branch as the
main line, and it is undoubtedly plain that it was properly so
referred to. In extending the branch, and with reference to
the extension, the branch would naturally be regarded and
spoken of as the main line. If not done in all cases it is some.what difficult to find any reason for it.
Again, by an ordinance passed March 10, 1890, granting
leave to change the motive power on the Garden street branch,
the right was given to operate that branch by electric power
"during the term of its present grant for said Garden street
branch." The "present grant" for the Garden street branch

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 137

Opinion of the Court.

was that which was granted in March, 1880, which was to terminate in twenty-five years, or March 22, 1905. Here was a
clear recognition of the time when that grant expired, and there
had been no ordinance or resolution of the council, since 1880,
which, in our opinion, changed the termination of that grant.
It is an entire mistake to say that at this time the right to
operate the Garden street tracks terminated at the same time
with the right of the company to operate the Euclid avenue
line, or that the Garden street branch was but an extension of
that line.
On the thirtieth of March, 1891, the right was granted to
construct and operate a second or additional track upon Central avenue (Garden street) from the east line of Willson avenue
to the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad tracks. It was provided in that ordinance that the right therein granted should
be for and untir. the expiration of the grants for the said company's main line. Here again the question arises.what was
the meaning of the expression "main line" as used in this
connection.- The ordinance allowed- a second or additional
track in a street in which the company then had the right to
use, and was using, a single track. So far as that extended
grant was concerned, the main line was the' rest of the Garden
street branch, and the same observations that we have made
heretofore in regard to the main line are operative here.
It cannot be possible that it was intended to limit the right
to use the second or additional track, in the portion of the street
mentioned, to a different time than that which existed with
relation. to the first track laid down by the company in the
Same street. Of course the two grants were meant to terminate
at the same tinue.
At this time the grant to the company's Euclid avenue line
had been extended so that it did not expire until July 13, 1913.
Can it be supposed that the council intended that this short
length of road, in which a second or additional track was to be
laid, was to be operated with two tracks until 1905 and after
that with one track until 1913? We think such a construction

.138

204 U. S.

is not permissible, and that what is meant by the language,
"main line," in that ordinance, means the line which is the
main line with reference to the extension therein granted,
namely, the Garden street branch, and not the Euclid avenue
line.
The ordinance of the twentieth of April, 1891, is somewhat
important. It granted the East Cleveland Railroad Company
permission to lay an additional or second track in Quincy
street, from New street to Woodland Hills avenue. That
street at the point indicated is part of the Garden street branch,
and, as compared with the rest of the Garden street branch, is
a very small portion thereof, and the ordinance ofily grants the
right to lay an additional track. The right granted was, by
the terms of section 3, to "be valid until the expiration of the
grants for said company's tracks on said Quincy street east of
Lincoln avenue, to wit, July 13, 1913."
It is said that the coqncil, in such ordinance, expressly
authorizes the continuation of the operation of this Central
avenue (Garden street) extension until July 13, 1913, the date
of the expiration of the Euclid avenue line of the company.
But the language used in this ordinance as to the time of the
expiration of the grant, for the company's tracks on Quincy
street 'east of Lincoln avenue, is a clear mistake of fact. The
grant, it willbe observed, is not in terms an extension to July 13,
1913. The reference to that date is but the expression of an
opinion that the date named is the true time of the termination
of the. Quincy street grants. It is not a grant extending to
that date, unless the previous grants are limited to that time.
Now, on April 20, 1891,. the grants on Quincy street, east of
Lincoln avenue, in fact*terminated either in 1904 or 1905, dependiag upon the construction of the language of the original
grant on Quincy street, made in February, 1885. That was
a grant which was to expire with the termination of the grant
for the main line. For the reasons already given we think
that that language meant the Garden street branch, which was
the main line as to that extension, and that it, therefore, ex-

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 139

Opinion of the Court.

pired in 1905, March 22. There was no subsequent legislation
which extended that grant beyond that time.
But if it be assumed that the grant for the company's tracks
on Quincy street, east of Lincoln avenue, was to terminate with
the grant for the Euclid avenue line as the main line, it must be
recollected that that grant on Quincy street was made February 9, 1885, to the Garden street branch, and at that time
the grant to the Euclid avenue line terminated in September,
1904. The grant of 1885 was not made to terminate with the
grant for the main line, as that main line might thereafter be extended, but it referred to that grant as it then existed, and it
was to be measured by such existing grant, and not by any
subsequent extension which might be granted to the Euclid
avenue line.
Nor do we think the time for the termination of the Garden
street branch was in any degree affected by the consolidation
of the various roads in 1893. The communication from the
railway company, through its vice-president, May 22, 1893,
states distinctly that it "does not claim any rights greater than
the constituent companies forming the organization, and that
it intends to obey all ordinances to which each and all of the
constituent companies were subject." Its intention to issue
transfer checks, so as to have a continuous ride for one fare,
gave no greater rights to the company than it theretofore had,
nor did the resolution of the council, consenting to the consolidation on condition that but one fare should be charged for a
continuous ride, give any greater rights to the consolidated
company than each of the constituent companies had theretofore enjoyed. The consolidation does not require, in order to
comply with the conditions specified in the resolution consenting to the consolidation, that the consolidated companies
should be permitted to operate until the expiration of the longest grant to any of the companies. At the expiration of the
grant to the Garden street branch the operation of that road
might terminate, while the operation of the rest of the consolidated roads could go on perfectly well. To hold that by virtue

OCTOBER TERM, 1906
Opinion of the Court.

204 U. S.

of the consolidation, upon the conditions stated, there was an
implied extension of the grant to the. Garden street branch of at
least eight years, is to violate the rules of construction above
referred to in regard to grants of this nature.
It is also strongly urged by the complainant that the ordinance passed soon after the consolidation ordinance, viz., the
ordinance of July 17, 1893, not only imposed additional burdens on the consolidated company, but that the ordinance
relates to a portion of the line originally constructed as part of
the Garden street branch, and that it also required the operation
of all the Garden street cars over these tracks, so that the council legislated as to the operation of thc tracks upon Garden
street and provided that such operation should continue until
July 13, 1913. It is true the ordinance provided that the grant
therein made should be limited to the above date, and there
were certain conditions attached to the making of the grant,
but it is quite plain to us that the ordinance could not be read
as thereby extending the time for the termination of the Garden
street branch without a most violent implication, based upon a
very small foundation. This is made clear when it is seen that
the streets through which the ordinance provides for extending
the double track railroad formed no part of the line originally
constructed as part of the Garden street branch. The latter
road was permitted to use, for a short distance, the tracks of
the Euclid avenue line from a point at the junction of Brownell
street (subsequently made Erie street) with Prospect street,
west to the public square. But that portion of the track of
the Euclid avenue line was never part of the line originally constructed for the Garden street branch, nor did it become such
because subsequently the branch road was permitted to use it
for the passage of its cars to the public square. It is quite clear,
therefore, that the limitation of the time for the termination of
the grant provided for in the sixth section of the ordinance was
not also an extension of the time for the termination of the separate grant to the Garden street branch from 1905 to 1913.
The same may be said of the ordinance of February 19, 1894,

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC RY. CO. v. CLEVELAND. 141

Opinion of the Court.'

cxtending the tracks in Willson avenue. While the council
consented to the extension by the complainant and the Cleveland City Railroad Company of the line of railway in Willson
avenue, and also to the operation of that line in connection with
other lines of the consolidated company, which included the
Garden street branch, yet it cannot be held that there arose
from that ordinance, when accepted by the company, a contract
which should extend the time on all .of the roads until the expiration of the grant contained in that ordinance-, July 1, 1914.
By such means an implied extension of time, affecting over 200
miles of track, as is stated, would be accomplished by making
these conditions in regard to the Willson avenue grant a substitute for a grant, in plain language, affecting the Garden street
branch. On the contrary, we think that the effect of that ordinance was simply to make it necessary for the Garden street
branch and the other roads also, to comply with the conditions
set forth in the ordinance until the expiration of their respective
and existing grants, but that ordinance did not thereby extend
the various other railroad grants by implication. There is no
such connection between the various roads as to make it necessary, in order to operate one, that all the others should be in
operation as a unit, and as comprehending one indivisible system. There is nothing in this record which shows any difficulty whatever in operating the Garden street branch as separate from the rest of the so-called system, or in operating that
system separate from the branch. If the council had intended
to extend the time of the termination of the various grants to
these railroads it surely would have said so, and not left it to
such vague and uncertain presumptions.
The chief importance of the various ordinances and resolutions for the extension of the Garden street branch, coupled
with the user of the tracks of the Euclid avenue line by the
branch road from Erie street west to the public square, and
providing for but one fare over'the whole road, is to strengthen,
if possible, the contention of complainant that such branch has
always been treated by the city and the company as a mere

204 U. S.

extension of the Euclid avenue line and to be operated in connection with it, so that a grant extending the time of the termination of the latter line included thereby the Garden street
branch. We think the contention is not justified by the facts.
The whole history of the branch line shows differently. Even
in the important matter of a change of motive power, the
Euclid avenue line was provided for'in 1888 and 1889, while
there was a separate and distinct provision made for the
Garden street branch in 1890, and a statement therein made
that the permission was granted to the Garden street branch
during the term of the present grant to said branch.
A careful examination of the whole record leads us to the
opinion that there is no error therein so far as the complainant's
appeal is concerned, and the decree upon its appeal is
Affirmed.
Upon the appeal of the defendants, we think little need be
said. The defendants insist that, upon the termination of the
grant to the Garden street branch, the rails, poles and other
appliances for operating that road, and then remaining on the
various streets, became the property of the city or at least
that the city had the right to take possession of the streets and
bf the trails, tracks, etc., therein existing. We agree with the
court below in the opinion that the title to the property remains
in 'the railroad company which had been operating the road,
.and we are of opinion that The Forest City Railway Company
had no rights in the streets, so far as to affect the right of the
complainant to its property then existing in such streets. How
that property may be disposed of is not now a matter before this court. We only hold that the defendant company cannot avail itself of the provisions of the ordinance of January 11,
1904, so far as taking possession of the property of the complainant is concerned.
The decree upon the defendant's appeal is also
Affirmed.
