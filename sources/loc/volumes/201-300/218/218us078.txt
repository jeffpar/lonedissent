STANDARD OIL COMPANY v. BROWN.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBL.
No. 168.

Argued April 22, 25, 1910.-Decided May 31, 1910.

While the pleadings and proofs should correspond, a rigid exactitude
is not required, and no variance should be regarded as material
where the allegation and proof substantially correspond.
Even if there is a variance between declaration and proof, if as in
this case, defendant is not misled, makes no objection to plaintiff's
proof but replies to it by testimony of likekind, is familiar With the
facts, does not indicate the variance and does not move for continuance, the variance cannot be regarded as fatal.
The extent of the knowledge of a defendant employer as to the use
made of appliances by an employ6 by whose act another employ6
is injured and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom are questions
for the jury and cannot be reviewed here.
The substitution of "would" for "could" in an instruction to the jury
in this case held not to have affected the minds of the jurors.
In this case there was no reversible error because the court did not
impress upon the jurors the fact that interest may affect credibility
of witnesses; and, qumre whether a party testifying exercises a privilege which may be emphasized as affecting.his credibility.

MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
This action was brought in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia for damages for injuries alleged to
have been received by defendant in error while in the employnent of plaintiff in error and through its negligence.
The case was tried to a jury, which rendered a verdict
in favor of the defendant in error in the sum of $6,500,
upon which judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed
by the Court of Appeals.
The assignments of error are based on certain instructions asked by the company which the trial court refused
to give, the chief of which requested the court to direct
the jury to find a verdict for the company upon the following grounds' (1) There was a fatal variance between
the pleadings and the proof. (2) The injury to defendant
in error was not caused by the negligence of the company,
but by the negligence of a fellow-servant or his own contributory negligence.
The first ground is the principal one discussed by counsel, and turns upon-a consideration of the declaration and
the proof.
An outline of the facts contained in the opinion of the
Court of Appeals is as follows:
VOL. CCX"ILI---.

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

"The plaintiff entered the employ of the defendant in
January, 1904, is an. oil tank wagon driver. His duties
required him to take a team and wagon from defendant's
barn in the 'morning, and, after using it during the day in
the delivery of oil, return it to the barn in the evening..
The plaintiff was required to groom his team in addition'
to his duties of delivering oil. The barn in which the
horses were kept Was thirty feet wide and fifty feet long.
It contained two rows of stalls, one on either side, with a
space of twelve feet between, extending the full length of
the barn. In the ceiling, above the space between the
stalls and about the middle of the barn, therm was an opening four feet square, surrounded on the floor of the loft
above by a wooden enclosure or box about four feet high.
In the loft was stored baled straw, which was used for
bedding the horses.
"It further appears that for about nine years one Coleman had been employed by the defendant, and among his
duties was that of bedding the horses; that, during the
period of his employment, Coleman had been accustomed
to throw bales of gtraw trhrough the opening in the ceiling from the loft to the floor below. In cloing so it was
necessary to lift the bale up to the top of th box or enclosure in the loft and. push it over, so that -it would fall
through the Qpening. Plaintiff received the injuries complained of February 2, 1904, by being struck by a bale of
straw dropped by Coleman from the loft through said
opening.
"There was evidence adduced at the trial to show',that
plaintiff had never been advised by the defendant, ox any
of defendant's employds, either of the existence of* the
opening. in the ceiling or the purpose for which it wAs
used. Plaintiff testified to this effect, and further, that
during the period of his employment-less than two
weeks-he was required to leave the barn with his wagon

STANDARD OIL CO. v. BROWN.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to deliver oil at 6 o'clock in the morning, and that he did
not complete the delivery of the oil and return to the
barn until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening. At the time of
year that he was employed-in January-he left the barn
before daylight in the morning and returned after dark
in the evening. It also appears that the barn was poorly
lighted, there being but a small oil lamp at each end of the
.passageway between the stalls.
"The witness Coleman testified that he not only notified plaintiff of the use made of the opening in the ceiling,
but warned him before throwing down the bale of straw
that injured. him."
Defendant in error denied "that Coleman either called
his attention to the hole, or explained its use, or gave him
any warning on the evening of the accident. Coleman is
not corroborated by any of the employds, as to his custom of calling out to persons below before throwing straw
through the opening."
The declaration contained four counts, in the first three
of which, with some verbal variations, it is alleged that
it was the company's duty to have the ".hole or opening"
in the ceiling of the stable so guarded that the bales of hay
in the loft above would not fall or pass through and fall
upon defendant in error or upon those engaged in the
performance of their duties in the stable. This duty, it
is alleged, was neglected, and a bale of hay was allowed to
fall through the hole on the defendant in error.
Those counts may be dismissed from consideration, as
defendant in error does not contend that the proof corresponds to them.
The fourth count, it is insisted, has such correspondence,
and expresses the grounds upon which the case was tried.
The following are the pertinent allegations of that count:
"It became and was also the duty of the said defendant not to permit the said hay and feed to be thus passed
through the said hole or opening without proper warn-

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U.S.

ing or timely notice to those employed in the stable below . . . and to give its employ6s engaged in handling or placing the hay and feed as aforesaid, as well as to
those who were employed in the stable below, such proper
and necessary instructions with respect to the dangers of
passing the hay and feed through the said hole or opening, and the performance of their respective duties as to
prevent injury and danger to the lives and limbs of the
employds engaged in the stable below, yet the defendant . . . did not . . . do any of the duties that
it was called upon to discharge in the premises, but, wholly
disregarding its said duties in the premises, did carelessly
and negligently allow a bale of .
. hay to fall or
pass, or be thrown through the said hole or opening, without any notice or warning or signal or instruction of any
kind to plaintiff," etc.
The rule is familiar and elementary that the pleadings
and proof must correspond, but a rigid exactitude is not
required. In Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689, 698, it .is
said
that modern decisions in regard to the correspondence
between the pleadings and the proof are more liberal and
reasonable than former ones, and states the 'rule to be by
statute in the Federal courts "to give judgment according to law and the right of the cause." It was observed
that "it is the established general rule in the state tribunals that no variance between the allegations of a
pleading and the proofs offered to sustain it shall be
deemed material, unless it be of a character, to mislead
the opposite party in maintaining his action on merits."
The final comment of the court is that irrespective of
those statutes, however, no variance ought ever to be regarded as material where the allegation and proof sub
stantially correspond. See also Liverpool and London and
the Globe Ins. Co. v. Gunther, 116 U. S. 113; B. & P. R. R.
Co. v. Cumberland, 176 U. S. 232, 238.
In the case at bar the company could not have been

misled. It made no objection to the testimony pf the
plaintiff (defendant in error here). It replied to it by
testimony of like kind. It did not indicate in what way
the proof varied from the pleadings nor move for a continuance. Moreover, we think the pleadings, though inartificially drawn, were su~icient to notify the companythat one of the grounds of action was its omission of duty"
to inform those whose employment made it necessary to
be in the stable of the danger to them of the use to which
the hole was put. And that such use was dangerous is
demonstrated. Indeed, it should not have needed the experience of the present case to make the danger clear to
the company. The company was familiar with the stable,
its construction and what that construction required.
One just employed might not know either, and his time of
-service might keep both from his knowledge. And such
is the contention in this case, which the verdict of the
jury sustained. A dimly lighted stable before daylight
and a dimly lighted stable after daylight, with a hole in
its ceiling through which bales of hay could be tossed or
dropped, seems to us as not to fulfill the duty of a master
to those servants who have not been informed of the practice and the performance of whose duties subjected them
to the danger which might result. Let it be granted that
Co!eman was a fellow-sei vant of defendant in error and
was negligent, it was nevertheless for the jury to say
whether the fault of the oompany contributed to the injury. Kreigh v. Westinghouse, Ch 'rh & Kerr Co., 214
U. S. 249. If the plaintiff had had knowledge of the
situation and its dangers he might have needed no warning from Coleman, and might have been protected by the
care which such knowledge would have induced.
The negligence of a fellow-servant was sought to excuse
the master for his neglect in Grace & Hyde, v. Kennedy,
99 Fed. Rep. 679, S.C., 40 C. C. A. 69. In reply to it the
court said, by Circuit Judge Shipman:

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

"The defect in the argument is a continuance of the
omission to recognize the ordinary necessity for the protection of the employ~s, and that the absolute duty of the
master to provide a safe place is not avoided by the neglect of his representative or servants to do the things
which will obviously prevent the known original danger."
In the discussion so far we have assumed that the company had knowledge of the use to which Coleman had put
the hole. Counsel, however, attacks the assumption, and
meets it by saying that the company could not anticipate
that Coleman would throw down an unopened bale of
straw without giving warning to his co-employ6s, especially, as it is further urged, he had been throwing down
straw through the opening without negligence for about
six years. But what the facts were in such regard and
what conclusions were to be drawn from them were for
the jury and cannot be reviewed here.
Error is assigned upon the refusal of the court to give
instructions, which presented the following propositions:
(1) That the company was not an insurer of the safety of
defendant while in its employment, "nor of the absolute
or even reasonable safety of its stable." (2) That the
presumption of law is that plaintiff contracted with reference to the risks, hazards and dangers ordinarily incident to the business of his employment as the company
conducted it at the time he entered its services. And
that (this was an independent instruction) the salary or
compensation received by the defendant in error was the
consideration for such risks. (3) There was no evidence
that Coleman was incompetent and that his competency
must be presumed.
It is not necessary to give a detailed attention to these
instructions. The court in its charge to the jury expressed
the legal principles of the case which were applicable to
the testimony.
The company also asked another instruction, the sub-

STANDARD OIL CO. v. BROWN.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

stance of which was as follows: That defendant in error
assumed the ordinary risks not only actually known to
him, but so far as they could (italics ours) have been known
to him by the exercise of ordinary care on his part, and
that if he knew, or by the exercise of care and prudence
could have known, of the- existence of the. hole then he
could not recover. The court gave the instruction, but
substituted the word "would" for "could."
The court was further requested to instruct the jury
that they must look to the interest of the witnesses, and
that where a witness is interested "the temptation is
strong to color, pervert or withhold the facts." An application was made of this to defendant in error and it
was requested that the jury be told that the law permitted
him to testify in his own' behalf, and that he having
availed himself of the privilege, it was for them to determine how far his testimony was credible, and that his
personal interest should be considered in weighing his
evidence and in determining how far it was worthy of
credit. The instruction was refused.
But little comment is needed on the contention that
there is reversible error in the action of the court. It
would be going very far to reverse the judgment on the
supposition that the jury would have seen a different
meaing in the word "could" than they saw in the word
"would" and in consequence would have imputed a
greater knowledge to defendant in error of the risks of his
employment. And it would be going equally far to reverse the verdict because the jury did not have especially
impressed on it, in the language counsel chose to employ,
that interest may affect the credibility of witnesses. We
are not prepared to say that a party to an action by testifying exercises a privilege which may"be emphasized as
affecting his credibility..
Judgment affirmed.
