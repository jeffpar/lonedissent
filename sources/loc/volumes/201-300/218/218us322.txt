HOOE v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

.No. 13.

Argued October 25, 26, 1910.-Decided November 28, 1910.

Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, declares what amount
shall be drawn from the Treasury in pursuance of an appropriation.
Heads of departments cannot by express or implied contract render
the Government liable for an amount in excess of that expressly appropriated by Congress for the subject-matter of the contract.
A claim against the United States for a specific amount of money
wlich is not expressly or by necessary implication authorized by a
valid enactment of Congress cannot be said to be founded on the
Constitution.
When an officer of the United States takes or uses private property
without authority of law he creates no condition under which the
Government is liable by reason of its constitutional duty to make
compensation. If private property has been taken or used by an
officer of the United States without authority of law the remedy is
not with the courts but with Congress alone.
A claim for such compensation does not rest oilthe Constitution, and
as an unauthorized act of the officer does not create a claim against
the United States, the Court.of Claims has no jurisdiction thereof
under the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505.
One renting a building to a department of the Government and receiving the entire appropriation for rent for such department has
no claim against the Government for any amount in excess of the
appropriation, even though he demands more and though he expressly excepts a part of the building from the lease and the department actually occupies the part reserved, nor has the Court of
Claims jurisdiction of such a claim as one arising under the provision
of the Constitution that private property shall not be taken without
compensation.
43 C. Cl. 245, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a claim for
rent of premises occupied by a department of the United
States, the power of an officer of the United States to
make contracts in excess of amount appropriated by
Congress, andlthe jurisdiction of the Court of Claims,
are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Appellants.

Mr. L. T. Michener, with whom Mr. W. W. Dudley and
Mr. P. G. Michener were on the brief, for appellants:
The Government of the United States has the absolute
power to take private property for piblic use, just compensation being made. The Secretary of the Interior
and the Civil Service Commissioners were and are officers
of the United States charged with the performance of
official duties. The United States acted by and through
them. The -actions of the Secretary are not to be regarded as his personal acts but as the acts of the Government. United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S.465, 466.
The House and Senate were fully informed as to what
the Secretary of the Interior and the Commission had done.
There is ample legislative authority for all that was
done. Act of January 16, 1883, § 4, 22 Stat. 403, makes
it the duty of the Secretary to provide suitable and convenient accommodations for the Commission and he
could speak and act through his subordinates or through
the officials of the Commission. Parish v. United States,
100 U. S.504; McElrath v. United States, 102 U. S. 436;
McCollum's Case, 17 C. Cl. 101, 102.
The United States, by its agents, proceeding under the
authority of an act of Congress, took appellants' property for public uses, and it thereby became obligated, by
virtue of the Constitution, to make just compensation,
and this action lies for the value of the use and occupancy of their property. United States v. Great Falls
Mfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656; Great Fais Mfg. Co. v.
United States, 124 U. S.581, 597; Monongahela Nay.' Co.
v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 324; United States v.
Lynah, 188 U. S.445, 460.
Neither the language of the general appropriation acts
nior of §§ 3679 and 3732, Rev. Stat., nor of the acts of
June 22, 1874, 18 Stat. L. 144, and March 3, 1877, 19 Stat.
L. 370, bars recovery. No act of Congress can defeat or
nullify the obligation contained in the Fifth Amendment.

Argument for Appellants.

218 U. S.

An appropriation act fixes the amount to be paid by the
Government in a certain fiscal year, but it does not strike
to earth a constitutional obligationby failing to provide
enough money to discharge that obligation. Shipman's
Case, 18 C. Cl. 138, 147; Graham's Case, 1 C. Cl. 381; Collins' Case, 15 C. Cl. 22, 35; Briggs' Case, 15 C. Cl. 48;
Parsons' Case, 15 C. Cl. 246.
When an act authorizes the officer to do a particular
thing without restriction as to cost, and an inadequate
appropriation is made, and the same thing done inures
to the benefit of the Government, or is accepted by the
proper public officers, an action will lie for the reasonable
value thereof. Shipman's Case, 18 C. Cl. 138, 146; Freedman's Bank Case, 16 C. Cl. 19, 29.
The statutes quoted by the court below which prohibit
the making of express contracts, apply to officials and
not to citizens, and do not apply to those cases or legal

reference to property in carrying on the business of the

Individuals as well as courts must take notice of the
extent of authority conferred by law upon a person acting irf an official. capacity, and the rule applies in such
a case that ignorance of the law furnishes no excuse for
any mistake or wrongful act. Hart v. United States, 95

No implied obligation for additional rent could
arise
as the rate of rent that could be paid for quarters for the
Commission was expressly limited by law to the amounts
appropriated by Congress and paid the appellants.
Receipt of payment, without protest, is conclusive
against a claim for additional pay, and there can be no
recovery of additional rent even if it should be held that
the tenancy was under implied contract, entirely independent of the express contracts, instead of a hold-over
tenancy, under the terms and conditions of the preceding
express contracts. United States v. Childs, 12 Wall. 232;

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellants, plaintiffs below, seek to recover from
the United States the sum of $9,000, the amount, which

HOOE v. UNITED STATES.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

they allege, is due them on account of the occupation
and use, by the Civil Service Commission, of certain premises in the city of Washington, District of Columbia.
The finding of fact by the Court of Claims--using largely
the words of the finding-may be summarized as follows:
On the tenth day of July, 1900, the Secretary of the
Interior, proceeding under the appropriation act for the
legislative, executive and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1901 (act of
April 17, 1900, 31 Stat. 125, c. 192), made a written agreement with plaintiffs for the leasing and renting to the
Government for the use of the Civil Service Commission,
of a certain building on E and Eighth streets, in Washington, "except the basement thereof," for the period
commencing August 1st, 1900 and ending June 30th,
1901, at the rate of $333.331/3 per month, or $4,000 for
the year-the right being reserved to the Government
to terminate the lease, after thirty days' written notice
at the end of any calendar month.
The Commission on August 1st, 1900, took possession
and remained in exclusive possession of the building, including its basement, until the bringing of this suit.
The amount appropriated by Congress for, the rent of
offices for the Commission for the year ending June 30th,
1901, was $4,000, one-twelfth of which was expended for
such rent for July, 1900.
On the third of March, 1901, Congress appropriated
for the rent of quarters for the Commission the sum of
$4,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1902. 31
Stat. 1000-1, c. 830, March 3, 1901. The Secretary of
the Interior, shortly after the beginning of that year,
proposed to the plaintiffs a renewal of the lease for that
year. But the plaintiffs expressed their unwillingness
"to rent the said building for another year at the rate
of $4,000 per annum," or to rent the entire building, ineluding the basement, then occupied by the Commisson,

218 U. S.

at a rental less than $6,000 per annum. Without further
action, on either side, "the defendants continued in
possession of said building and basement during said
year, paying," however, to the plaintiffs $4,000, the rent
specified in the lease for the first year, to wit, $4,000.
In his estimates submitted for appropriations by Congress for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1903, the'Secretary named $6,000 "for rent of quarters for the Civil
Service Commission." As the general legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill for that year did
not, as it passed the House of Representatives, include
that sum, the plaintiffs' agent, in writing, informed the
chief clerk of the Interior Department that unless the
Senate fixed the rent at $6,000 the plaintiffs would ask
possession of the property at the earliest convenient
time. Of this attitude of the plaintiffs the Senate was
informed by plaintiffs' agent. He appeared before the
House Committee on Appropriations, and by the Secretary of the Interior transmitted the letter of plaintiffs
to the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Congress,
however, refused to increase the appropriation to $6,000,
and for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1903, appropriated "for rent of buildings for the Department of the
Interior, namely, . . . For . . . Civil Service
Commission, four thousand dollars." 32 Stat. 162, Pt. 1,
c.594, April 28, 1902. No further action was taken by
either party in relation to an increase of rent or the demanding of possession, and the United States continued
in possession of the property, including the basement, for
that fiscal year, paying rent at the rate of $4,000 per year.
Although the Secretary of the Interior estimated an increase of $2,000 for quarters of the Civil Service Commission for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1904, Congress
.appropriated only $4,500. 32 Stat. 854, Pt. 1, c. 755,
February 25, 1903. In consequence of this increase the
Secretary sought to rent from the plaintiffs all the "build-

Opinion of the Court.

ing and premises for the use of the Civil Service Commission for the sum of $4,500 appropriated," but plaintiffs
refused to do that. The Secretary finally, August 18th,
1903, made a lease from claimants for all of said building, "except the basement," for the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1904, at the rate of $4,500 per year.
For the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, Congress,
March 18th, 1904, appropriated $4,500 for the rent of
quarters for the Commission. 33 Stat. 85, Pt. 1, c, 716,
March 18, 1904. In accordance with that appropriation
the Secretary proposed to the plaintiffs, in writing, to
renew the lease of August 18th, 1903, for the fiscal year
ending June 30th, 1905, at the rate of $4,500 per annum.
The plaintiffs took no action on this proposal, except to
write to the Secretary requesting that the basement of
the building, which had not been included in either of
the leases to the Government, be included "in the lease
at the rate of 30 cents per.square foot for its floor space."
Neither party took any further steps in reference to the
renewal of the lease or for an increase of rental for the
fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, 'and the claimants
were paid rent for that year at the rate of $4,500 as provided by the appropriation and as specified in the lease
for the preceding year. A. like appropriation of $4,500
was made for rent of quarters for the Commission for the
fiscal.year 1906, and that body, without any express renewal of the lease for that year, continued in occupation
of the entire building, up to August 1st, 1905, for which
the claimants have been paid at the rate of $4,500 per year.
The Court of Claims further found: "Although the
claimants never rented to the .Government for the use
of the Civil Service Commission, or for' any other purpose, that part of the basement of said building not occupied by heating and elevator plants and equipment
thereof, yet the Civil'Service Commission took possession
of this portion of said basement and has continlually oc-

cupied and used the same from the 1st day of August,
1900, until the bringing of this action, August 1, 1905;"
and in a letter to the Acting Secretary of the Interior,
dated November 28, 1904i relative to the matter of a
renewal of the Government's lease for the building for
that fiscal year, the claimants, among other things,
called attention to the fact that the basement of the
building was then fully occupied by the Civil Service
Commission. The fair rental value of that portion of the
basement occupied and used as aforesaid was $400 per
year, and the rental value of the entire building, including the basement, was not less than $6,000 per year.
"During the time that the defendants have occupied and
used said building and basement belonging to the claimants, the claimants have receipted for rent for the same in
full, except for the basement, which has been specially
excluded from each of said receipts given by the claimants. With the exception of this exclusion of the basement from said receipts, it does not appear that any other
protest was ever made by the claimants that said payments were not in full for the rent legally due to them for
said building. The claimants, however, repeatedly insisted that the defendants were not paying enough rent
for said building, and on one occasiop asked for extra
rent for said basement, as heretofore found."
The court below directed the petition to be dismissed
and judgment to be entered for the Government. That
was accordingly done.
The pleadings and facts indicate that the claim of the
appellants is divided into two parts; one, arising out of
the occupancy and use by the Civil Service Commission
of the building above the basement; the other, for the
occupancy and use by that body of the basement.
Let us, at the outset, inquire as to the circumstances

Opinion of the Court.

Head of a Department or a subordinate, may or may not,
by his acts, impose liability upon the Government, in
the absence of authority from Congress. The conclusion.
we have reached upon that inquiry is controlling.
Looking at the statutes in force at the time the transactions here in question occurred, we find that by § 3679
of the Revised Statutes, it was provided that "no department of the Government shall expend, in any one fiscal
year, any sum in excess of appropriations made by .Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in
any contract for the future payment of money in excess
of such appropriations;" and by § 3732, that "no contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be
made, unless the same is authorized by law or is under
an appropriation adequate to .its fulfillment, except in
the War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence,
forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, which, however,
shall not exceed the necessitiqT of the current year."
An act of Congress of June 22d, 1874, provided that
"hereafter no contract shall be rhade for the rent of any
building or part of any building in Washington, not now
in use by the Government, to be used for the purposes
of the Government until an appropriation therefor shall
have been made in terms by Congress." 18 Stat. 133,
144, c. 388. Again, by the deficiency appropriation act
of March 3d, 1877, it vas provided that "hereafter no
contract shall be made for the rent of any building, or
part of any building, to be used for the purposes of the
Government in the District of Columbia, until an appropriation therefor shall have been made in terms by
Congress, and that this clause be regarded as notice to
all contractors or lessors of any such building or any part
of building." 19 Stat. 363, 370, c. 106.
The above provisions were all in force when. the Civil
Service Commission was created. By the act creating
that tribunal it was provided that "it shall be the duty

of the Secretary of the Interior to cause suitable and
convenient rooms and accommodations to be assigned or
provided, and to be furnished, heated, and lighted, at
the city of Washington, for carrying on the work of said
commission and said examinations, and to cause the
necessary stationery and other articles to be supplied,
and the necessary printing to be done for said commission." 22 Stat. 403, 405, c. 27, January 16, 1883.
We have seen that the occupancy by the Civil Service
Commission of the plaintiffs' building commenced August 1st, 1900. Now, the general appropriation act for
the legislative, executive'and judicial expenses of' the
Government, covering the fiscal year ending June. 30th,
1901 opened with the clause providing that "the following sums be and the same are hereby, appropriated
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation for the service of th fiscal
year ending June 30th, 1901, for the objects hereinafter
expressed, namely. . . . For rent of buildings for the
Department of the Interior, namely, . . . Civil Service Commission, $4,000." 31 Stat. 86, 125, c. 192. Each
appropriation act for subsequent fiscal years, covering
the whole period of the occupancy by the Commission
of the plaintiffs' building, opened with a similar provision. So that the plaintiffs and all others dealing with
officers of the Government were distinctly advised as
to the amount appropriated by Congress for any specified purpose, and knew, or are to be deemed to have
known, that when they received such specified amount
for the purpose named, it was intended by Congress to
be in full compensation for the service rendered for the
Government in that fiscal year. The plaintiffs received
before the bringing of this suit the appropriation made
by Congress specifically for rent of the building for the
Civil Service Commission, during the entire period of
the Commission's occupancy and use of it. We recall,

HOOE v. UNITED STATES.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

in this connection, the fact found by the court below,
that the claimants' receipted bills recited that the amount
paid to them was in full for the rent, as fixed by the appropriationacts of Congress-excepting always, it is true,
the rent for the basement of their building. It is also
true that the plaintiffs complained that the amount appropriated was inadequate, but they accepted and receipted for it as the sum appropriatedby Congress for purposes of rent for the Commission, expecting or hoping, no
doubt, that Congress would, in due time, remedy the
wrong which, as they insisted, had been and was being
done to them in respect both of the building and its basement.
But it'is said in this connection that the act of 1883
made it the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to cause
suitable rooms to be provided for the Commission, and
as the plaintiffs' building was occupied and used by the
Commission, for public purposes, with his knowledge and
consent, the Government is under a liability to pay the
claimants the reasonable value of such occupancy and
use. -This view cannot be accepted, except upon the
theory that during the period in question it was within
the power of the Secretary, by contract, in the matter of
rent for a building for the Commission, to exceed the sum
appropriated by Congress for that purpose. We reject
that theory as inconsistent with the acts of Congress
and therefore inadmissible. It is for Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, to say what amount may be
drawn from the Treasury in pursuance of an appropriation. The statutes above referred to make it plain that
the Secretary was without power to make any express
contract for rent in excess of the appropriation made by
Congress, particularly where, as here, Conigress had taken
care to say, in respect of each year's rent, that the appropriation shall be in full' compensation for the specific
purpose named. in the appropriation act. It is equally

Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

clear that the Secretary could not, by his acts, create a
state of things from which, in the absence of legislation
on the subject, an implied contract could arise under
which the Government would be liable, by reason of its
constitutional duty, to make just compensation for the
use of r- tte -property taken for public purposes. In
such a case the remedy is with Congress, and not with
the courts. If an officer, upon his own responsibility and
without the authority of Congress, assumes to bind the
Government, by express or implied contract, to pay a
sum in excess of that limited by Congress for the purposes
of such a contract, the contract is a nullity, so far as the
Government is concerned, and no legal obligation arises
upon its part to meet its provisions. If the circumstances
justify such a course, Congress in its discretion can intervene and do justice to the owner of private property
used by officers of the Government in good faith for public purposes, although without direct legislative authority. The plaintiffs' remedy is in that direction.
What we have said is equally applicable to the claim
of the plaintiffs for tile reasonable value of the use of the
baserhent of the buildirig in question. Granting that the
plaintiffs have not been -paid for its use such sum as they
are justly, entitled to have received, we are still confronted with the facts heretofore referred to, that Congress has appropriated, each year of the Commission's
occupancy, a specific sum in full for rent of buildings
for the use of that body; that it 'has in effect prohibited
the use of the public money, in excess of that sum for
rent of buildings for that purpose; and that plaintiffs
have already received the entire sums appropriated by
Congress for rent. The conclusion necessarily follows
that the OKvernment cannot, in this case, be made liable
to suit, either under an exprus or implied contract, to
oay for the use of plairttiffs'.Vroperty any amount in excess
of the sums appropriated by Congress for that purpose.

HOOE v. UNITED STATES.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

But it is contended by the plaintiffs that their right
to recover does not depend upon contract, expressed or
implied, but upon the duty, expressly imposed by the
Constitution, to make just compensation for private
property taken for public use. In support of this view
we are reminded that the Tucker act of March 3d, 1887,
24 Stat. 505, c. 359, for the first time, in express words,
conferred on the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear
and determine claims against the Government "founded
upon the Constitution of the United States." The claims
here in question, it -is argued, can be rested exclusively
on the Constitution, without reference to any statute of
the United States, or to any contract arising undpr an
act of Congress. The argument is ingenious but it is
unsound. It cannot be said that any claim for a specific
amount of rmoney against the United States is founded
on the Constitution, unless such claim be either, expressly
or by necessary implication, authorized by some valid
enactment of Congress. The creation of a Civil Service
Commission, providing a building or rooms for its use,
and the amount to be paid from time to time by the
Government as rent for such building apd rooms, are all
matters within the complete control of Congress. It is
the Constitution which places these matters under the
control of Congress. If an officer of the United States
assumes, by virtue alone of his office, and without the
authority of Congress, to take such matters under his control, he will not, in any legal or constitutional sense, represent the United States, and what he does or omits to
do, without the authority of the Congress, cannot create
a claim against the Government "founded upon the Constitution." It would be a claim having its origin in a
violation of the Constitution. The constitutional prohibition against taking priirate property for public use
without just compensation is directed against the Government, and not against individual or public officers

able discussion of the authorities.
The judgment must be affirmed.
It is so ordered.
