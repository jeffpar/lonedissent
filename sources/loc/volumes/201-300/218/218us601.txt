UNITED STATES v. KISSEL AND HARNED.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 390.

Argued November 10, 11, 1910.-Decided December 12, 1910.

Under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat.
1246, when the indictment is quashed this court is confined to a
consideration of the grounds of decision mentioned in such statute,
United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370, and there is-a similar limit
when the case comes up from a judgment sustaining a special plea
in bar.
Although mere continuance of result of a crime does not continue the
crime itself, if such continuance of result depends upon continuous
co6peration of the conspirators, the conspiracy continues until the
time of its abandonment or success.
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is more than a contract in restraint
of trade; the latter is instantaneous, but the former is a partnership
in criminal purposes and as such may.have continuance in time; and
so held in regard to a conspiracy made- criminal by the Anti-trust
Act of July 2, 1890.
Whether the indictment in this case charges a continuing conspiracy
with technical sufficiency is not before the court on the appeal taken
under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, from a judgment
sustaining special pleas of limitation in bar.
Allegations in the indictment consistent with other facts alleged that
a conspiracy continued until the date of filing must be denied under
the general issue and cannot be met by special plea in bar..
This couht, having on an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act of
March 2, 1907, held that allegations as to continuance of a conspiracy cannot be met by special plea in bar, all defenses, including
that of limitations by the ending of the conspiracy more thari three

Conspiracy is a non-contifiuous crime, and an indictment which charges its commission on a date barred by
the statute of limitations charges an outlawed offense and
is not saved by an allegation of continuance within the
limitation. United States v. Irvine, 98 U. S. 450.
Where an indictment charges a crime which is not essentially continuous with a continuando, the continuando
may be disregarded and the indictment treated as charging no more than the commission of the offense on the
first day. Wharton's Crim. Pl. & Pr., 9th ed., § 125;

act of agreeing or confederating: it is the bare act of
agreeing alone that constitutes the crime. Archibold's

But many crimes, which are non-continuous, are by
their nature subject to renewal, and in such case, each
renewal of the act constituting the gravamen of the offense constitutes a new crime. It is the nature of the act
constituting the offense that determines its continuous or
non-continuous nature. State v. Poyner, 134 N. Car. 609;
Wharton's Crim. Law, 10th ed., § 27; State v. Prescott, 33

53, 56; People v. Flatherty, 162 N. Y. 532, 538.
The results which flow from conspiracy, i. e., the acts
done in pursuance of it, form no part of the offense; but a
compact which does not contain within itself all the elements of wrong will not be rendered indictable by the
criminality of acts done in furtherance of it. United
States v. Britton, 108 U. S. 199; McKenna v. United States,

if criminal they constitute separate crimes, and a conviction or acquittal on either the conspiracy or the separate
crime is no bar to a prosecution for the other offense.

A conspiracy is a renewable offense, and it is renewed
whenever two or more persons animated by a corrupt
intent consciously participate in any act in furtherance of
that intent. While those who enter upon a conspiracy
may secure immunity for their criminal acts after a lapse
of three years if they do nothing further within the three
years, those who persist in their original purpose and seek
by cooperative action to carry it into effect incur a liability each time they commit the offense of conspiring.
The Government's theory that conspiracy is a continuous
crime, would have every incentive to cause the conspirator who had once embarked to continue in his criminal course and not to desist or abstain therefrom. Matter
of Neileen, 131 U. S. i76; In re Snow, 120 U. S. 274.

290, and United States. v. McAndrews & Forbes Co., 149
Fed. Rep. 823, are not incompatible with this view. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, .193 U. S. 197, and
Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, do not sustain the proposition that. parties can render themselves liable to be punished br'minally under the Sherman Act without doing
any Aet whatever. And see People v. Mather, 4 Wend.

Bartilson 85 Pa. St. 482, 486.
In the light of these authorities, it is submitted that
the sound doctrine is that the crime of conspiracy is not
an, essentially continuous offense, but that it is subject
to renewal and that the renewal may be evidenced by the
conscious participation of any of the conspirators in acts
done for the purpose of effecting the object of the original
conspiracy.

MR. JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ 'of error brought by the United States to
reverse a judgment of the Circuit Court sustaining pleas
in bar pleaded to an indictment by the defendants in
error. 173 Fed. Rep. 823. *The first count of the indictment alleges that the defendants in error and others
named, on December 30, 1903, and from that day until the
day of presenting the indictment (July '1, -1909), have
engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade in
refined sugar aniong the several States of the Union, that
is to 'say, to eliminate free competition and prevent all
coM etition with the American Sugar Refining Company,

one of the defendants, by a would-be competitor, the
Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company. It then sets
forth, at length, the means by which the alleged purpose
was to be accomplished, and what are put forward as
overt acts done in pursuance of the plan. In other counts,
referring to the first, the defendants are alleged to have
conspired to monopolize the trade in refined sugar among
the States. They are similar counts as to the trade in
raw sugar and molasses, and as to trade with foreign nations. The offenses aimed at, of course, are the conspiracies punished by the act of July 2, 1890; c. 647, 26
Stat. 209, commonly known as the Sherman Act.
There are other counts in the indictment, but the argument was devoted mainly to these. The defendants severally pleaded to all of them the limitation of three years
fixed by Rev. Stat., § 1044, alleging that for more than
three years before the finding of the indictment on July 1,
1909, they did not engage in, or do any act in aid of, such
conspiracies. The defendant Kissel added averments that
all the overt acts alleged to have been done within three
years before July 1, 1906, were done without his participation, consent or knowledge. He also pleaded that since
October 6, 1906, the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company had been in the hands of a duly appointed receiver.
We deem it unnecessary to state the pleadings with
more particularity, because the only question before us
under the act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, is
whether the plea in bar can be sustained. That this court
is confined to a consideration of the grounds of decision
mentioned in the statute when an indictment is quashed
was decided in United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370, 399.
We think that there is a similar limit when the case comes
up under the other clause of the act, from a "judgment
sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has
not been put in jeopardy." This being so, we are not concerned with the technical sufficiency or redundancy of the

Opinion of the Court.

indictment, or even, in the view that we presently shall
express, with any consideration of the nature of the overt
acts alleged. The indictment charges a conspiracy beginning in1903, but continuing down to the date of filing.
It pretty nearly was conceded that if a conspiracy of this
kind can be continuous, then the pleas in bar are bad.
Therefore we first will consider whether a conspiracy can
have continuance in time.
. The defendants argue that a conspiracy is a completed
crime as soon as formed, that it is simply a Case of unlawful agreement, and that therefore the continuando may
be disregarded and a plea is proper to show that the statute of limitations has run. Subsequent acts in pursuance
of the agreement may renew the conspiracy or be evidence of a renewal, but do not change the nature of the
original offense. So als6, it is said, the fact that an unlawful contract contemplates future acts or that the results of a successful conspiracy endure to a much later date
does not affect the character of the crime.
The argument, so far as the premises are true, does not
suffice to prove -that a conspiracy, although it exists as
soon as the agreement is made, may not continue beyond
the moment of making it. It is true that the unlawful
agreement satisfies the definition of the crime, but it does
not exhaust it. It also is truer of course, that tbe mere
continuance of the result of a crime does not continue the
crime. United States v. Irtine, 98 U. S. 450. But when
the plot contemplates bringing to pass a continuous result
that will not continue without the continuous cor'peration
of the conspirators to keep it up, and there is such continuous co6peration, it is a perversion of natural thought
and of natural language to call such continuous co6peration a cinematographic series of distinct conspiracies,
rather than to call it a single one. Take the present case.
A conspiracy to restrain or monopolize trade by improperly excluding a competitor from business contemplates

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

that the conspirators will remain in business and will
continue their combined efforts to drive the competitor out until they succeed. If they do continue such efforts in pursuance of the plan the conspiracy continues up
to the time of abandonment or success. A conspiracy in
restraint of trade is different from and more than a contract in restraint of trade. A conspiracy is constituted by
an agreement, it is true, but it is the result of the agreement, rather than the agreement itself, just as a partnership, although constituted by a contract, is not the contract but is a result of it. The contract is instantaneous,
the partnership may endure as one and the same partnership for years. A conspiracy is a partnership in criminal
purposes. That as such it may have continuation in time
is shown by the rule that an overt act of one partner may
be the act of all without any new agreement specifically
directed to that act.
The means contemplated for the exclusion of the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company were the making of a
large loan by the American Sugar Refining Company
thiough Kissel to one Segal and the receiving from him
of more than half the stock of the Pennsylvania Company
with a power of attorney to vote upon it, Segal not knowing that the American Company was behind Kissel. The
loan was to be for a year, but the American Company was
to .use the power of voting to prevent the Pennsylvania
Company from going on with its business, and, as Segal
was dependent largely upon the returns from that company for means of repaying the loan, he was to be prevented from repaying it and the control of the Pennsylvania Company retained until it should be ruined and
finally driven from business. It is alleged that the loan
was made and that a vote was passed that the Pennsylvania Company refrain from business until further order
of the board of directors. Now of coursd it well may be
that the object was so far accomplished by this vote that

UNITED STATES v. KISSEL.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the conspiracy was at an end; but a vote upon pledged
stock that might be redeemed was not necessarily lasting,
and further action might be necessary to reach the desired result. The allegation that the. conspiracy continued down to the date of the indictment is not contradicted by the vote. Furthermore, as we have said, the
only question here is whether the plea of the statute of
limitations is good.
Taking it that the conspiracies made criminal by the
act of July 2, 1890, may have continuance, we are of opinion that the pleas are bad. To be sure, it still might be
argued that the general rule that time need not be proved
as laid applies to continuing offenses, that therefore the
allegation in the indictmhent, so far as it specifies the time
in which the conspiracy was maintained, is immaterial,
and that a plea traversing only that is, in substance, a
plea in confession and avoidance and good. Whether in a
charge of a continuing offense even such specific earmarks
of time as those in this indictment make it enter into the
essence of the offense we shall not discuss. Time is held
to be of the essence in Massachusetts and some other
States - Commonwealth v. Pray, 13 Pick. 359, 364; Commonwealth v. Briggs, 11 Met. 573; State v. Small, 80
Maine, 452; Fleming v. State, 28 Tex. App. 234; while'this
has been thought to- be a local peculiarity, and the contrary has been decided elsewhere. State v.Reno, 41 Kansas, 674, 682, 683. State v. Arnold, 98 Iowa, 253. Bishop,
New Criminal Procedure, §§ 397, 402.. However this may
be, if the plea of the statute of limitations is good where
it confesses and avoids all that the indictment avers,
still, as was pointed out in an. able brief by the late
lamented Solicitor .General, it is open to too many objections and difficulties to b6 encouraged or allowed except
in clear cases. Apart from technical rules the averments
of time in the indictment are expected and intended to be
proved as laid. The. overt acts relied upon coming down

218 U. S.

to within three years of the indictment are alleged to have
been done in pursuance of the..conspiracy, and the pleas
must be taken to deny that allegation, unless. they rely
upon the supposed imp9ssibility of the acts having the
character alleged. It is only by an artificial rule, if at all,
that the plea can be treated as not traversing the indictment, and we are not prepared to give that supposed rule
such an effect.
The discussion at the bar took a wider range than is
open at this stage. It hardly is necessary to explain that
we have nothing to say as to what evidence would be sufficient to prove the continuation of the conspiracy, or where
the burden of pleading or proof as to abandonment would
be. We deal only with a naked and highly technical question, when once the possibility of continuation is established; and as to that we cannot bring ourselves to doubt.
To sum up and repeat. The indictment charges a continuing conspiracy. Whether it does so with technical
sufficiency is not before us. All that we decide is that a
conspiracy may have continuance in time, and thai where,
as here, the indictment, consistently with the other facts,
alleges that it did so continue to the date of filihg, that
allegation must be denied under the general issue and not.
by a special plea. Under the general issue all defenses,
including the defense that the conspiracy was ended by
success, abandonment, or otherwise more than three years
b6fore July 1, 1906, will be open and unaffected by what
we now decide.
Judgment reversed.
