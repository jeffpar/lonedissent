pointed out in United States v. Butterworth, 169 U. S.
600, 603, distinguishing Commissioner v. Sellew, 99 U. S.
624, and Thompson v. United States, 103 U. S. 480. The
only ground for making McChesney a defendant is to
enjoin him personally from *doing something which hc
may not lawfully do, and to require him personally to do
another thing which it is claimed is his legal duty to do as

an administrative act requiring no discretion. If he disobey the mandate or injunction of the court he personally would be in contempt. He only can be rightly made
to bear the costs of this proceeding if the complainant
should succeed, and he only could be compelled to obey
the decree of the court. As his official authority has terminated, the case, so far as it seeks to accomplish the object of the bill, is at an end, there being no statute providing for the substitution of McChesney's successor in
a suit of this character. The case is governed by United
States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall. 604; United States v. Butterworth, 169 U. S. 600, and Caledonian Coal Co. v. Baker,

No. 25.

Argued November 1, 1910.-Decided November 28, 1910.

Even if the bill seeking a sale of infant's property for reinvestment
does not clearly state a case within the authority of the-court, the
decree of sale, appointment of trustee and execution of his bond are
not mere nullities subject to collateral attack.
The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia is one of general ju-

risdiction possessing all powers conferred on Circuit and District
Courts of the United States--in fact, the usual powers incident to
a court of equity at the date of the Revolution, not incompatible
with the changed forms and principles of government or affected
by subsequent legislation. Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 382.
The inherent power of a court of equity of general jurisdiction over
the persons and estates of infants is very wide. Its errors in regard
to a sale of real estate of infants are reversible by appellate procedure, but until so corrected its judgment is not a nullity.
The voluntary surety on the bond of a trustee in a proceeding to sell
real estate is estopped to attack the validity of the decree appointing the trustee or of the bond.
Where the demurrer to one plea of the answer was overruled and plaintiff did not plead further, reversal of the judgment and sustaining
the demurrer to that plea leaves the other pleas open to be dealt
with by the court below.
This court only having before it the demurrer on one plea to the
answer which was overruled below, it reverses the judgment and sustains the demurrer, and other pleas in defense remain at issue and
this court will not consider them on this appeal.
31 App. D. C. 433, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the liability of a surety on a
bond given for faithful performance of his duty by a trustee
appointed to sell the interest of an infant in real estate,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Win. Hepburn Russell, with whom Mr. W. H. Robeson was on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
The Supreme Court of the District having exercised
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit in which
'the bond was given, its determination of its own jurisdiction is, after this lapse of time, binding upon all persons

Waggaman, as principal, and Daniel B. Clarke, as his
surety. The bond was in these words and figures:

)
VS.
Robert Edward Hine et al.
-"Know all men by these. presents, that we, Thomas E.
Waggaman, principal, and Daniel B. Clarke, surety, all
of the District of "Columbia, acknowledge ourselves indebted to the United States of America in the penal - sum
of eighteen'thousand dollars, for the payment of which
we bind oursei'es and every of our heirs, executors and
administrators, jointly and severally, for and in the whole.
Sealed with our seals, and dated this 7th day of July
A. D. 1899.
"Whereas the said Thomas E. Waggaman has been
duly appointed trustee to make sale of the real estate in
the proceedings in this cause mentioned.
"Now the condition of the above obligation is such,
that if the above bounden Thomas E. Waggaman shall
'well and truly discharge the duties devolving upon him
as such trustee and shall in all things obey such order and.
decree as this-court shall make in the premises, then the
above obligation to be void and of no effect; else to be
in full force and virtue."
The bond, as shown by its recitals, was executed in a
pending equity cause in the Supreme Court of the District,
wherein, the parties for whose use this suit is brought
were parties, either plaintiff or defendant.
The declaration, in substance, averred a breach of the
bond, in this: That Waggaman had assumed the duty and
function of trustee for the sale directed by the decree,
had sold and conveyed the property as directed, but had
not accounted for the proceeds, having unfaithfully vio-

Opinion of the Court.

lated the trust and confidence reposed in him by squandering and misappropriating such proceeds. Itwas further
averred that on November 21, 1Q05, the said Waggaman
had disobeyed a decree of the court, requiring him to pay
into court the sum of $8,147.27, with interest from August 1, 1904, and was therefore in default.
The defenses with whih. we are concerned upon this
writ are those made by-the surety, who, by a plea which
the court below sustained, challenged the obligation of the
bond. The insistence is that the Supreme Court of the
District exceeded its authority in decreeing a sale of the
land which was sold by Waggaman, and his appointment
to make such a sale was a nullity, and the bond executed
by him with the defendant Clarke as surety mere waste
paper.
The proceeding in the Supreme Court in which this bond
was executed was a bill in equity to sell lot No. 1912
I street N. W., Washington, D. C., as the property of a
minor for purpose of reinvestment under like trusts. The
title was held under the will of Robert B. Hine, who died
in 1895. So much of the will as concerns the title tothe
premises of which a sale was decreed was in these words:
"I give and bequeath to my dear wife, Mattie McC.
Hine, a life interest in all my, real estate. As executrix
she will collect the income arising from said real*estate,
and after paying all necessary expenses of collection,
fire insurance and repairs, shall retain the remainder of the
income for her own use. After the death'of my said
wife, I give and bequeath my real estate to my son,
Robert Edward, and any other children that may hereafter be born to me. If my said wife should marry again,
she will from the date of such remarriage, be entitled to
retain for ler own use, one-half of the net income of my
estate, and will pay the remainder to. a trustee for my
son, and any other ,hildren who may hereafter be borne
to me. Provided, further, that should my wife marry

again, and should no child of mine by her, be then surviving, the whole net income from my estate shall be retained by her, during her life, and after her ileath, ny
real estate shall be sold, and of the proceeds, one-third
shall be paid to my father, the Rev. Henry Hine now of
Boston Spa. Yorkshire England, if he then be living,
he not being then living to -my mother Amelia Burnett
Hine, neither of them being then living to my sister,
Amelia Burnett Iine, and the residue, shall be equally
divided between my brothers and sisters share and share
alike. If neither parent, nor my sister Amelia Burnett
Hine outlives my said wife, then the whole net proceeds
of the sale of my real estate, shall be equally divided,
between my brothers and sisters. Should any of these
have died, before this distribution takes place, their surviving children shall receive the share of the deceased
parent, share and share alike.'
The complainant in the suit' was Mattie McC. Hine,
the widow of the testator, who averred that she had
never remarried. The defendants were the oxly issue of
her marriage with testator, her son Robert E. Hine,
then an infant of nine years of age, and the persons who,
under the will, were given contingent interests. The
minor Robert E. Hine was duly-served and answered by
guardian ad -litem. The other defendants were made
parties by publication, as persons not to be found in the
District. The bill alleged that the dwelling-house was
deteriorating in value, that it was often unrented, that
repairs, insurance and taxes left an inconsiderable net
income, which would go 'on diminishing. That she believed she could obtain $8,500 for the premises, a sum
much larger than the value of the property to the remaindermen when her estate should fall in, and that the proceeds could be so invested as to much improve her income
and better "enable her to provide for the remainderman
during his minority." The bill alleged that the will did not

HINE v. MORSE.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

prohibit a sale. The prayer was for a decree of sale and
for a reinvestment, in pursuance of § 973, Rev. Stat. D. C.
Upon the pleadings and proof the court directed a sale
of the said lot, and in the same decree appointed Thomas
E. Waggaman "trustee to make the sale," requiring him to
execute a bond with surety "conditioned for the faithful
performance of the trust reposed in him by this decree, or
which may be reposed in him by any future order or
decree in the premises." By the same decree he was
required "to bring into court the money arising on such
sale . . . to be disposed of under the direction of
the court," etc.
The contention is that the Supreme Court of the District has no inherent or general power as a court of equity
to decree the sale of an infant's property for the purpose
of reinvestment, and that its jurisdiction was wholly dependent upon statutory power conferred by §§ 969 el seq.,
Rev. Stat. D. C., taken from the act of Congress of
August 18, 1856. Section 969 reads as follows:
"Where real estate is limited by deed or will to one or
more for life or lives, with a contingent limitation over
to such issue of one or more of the tenants for life as shall
be living at the death of their parent or parents, and the
deed or will does not prohibit a sale, the Supreme Court
of the District may, upon the application of the tenants
for life, and if the court shall be of the opinion that it is
expedient to do so, order a sale of such estate, and decree
to the purchaser an absolute and complete title in fee
simple."
The contention is that the only jurisdiction conferred
by this statute is confined to real estate which is by deed
or will "limited to one or more lives, with a contingent
limitation over to such issue of one or more of the tenants
for life as shall be living at the death of either parent,"
and that under the will of Robert B. Hine the devise to
Robert Edward Hine is a vested and not a contingent

218 U. S.

remainder, while the contingent remainders--contingent
on the death of said Robert and the subsequent remarriage of his mother, the said Mattie--are not limitations
over to issue of either Robert B. line or Mattie line.
For this construction of the statute the court below
relied upon Trust Co. v. Muse, 4 App. D. C. 12, 20; Thaw
v. Ritchie, 5 Mack. 200, and Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App.
D. C. 384.
Clearly under the will there was a life tenant and a
remainder over at the death of the life tenant to Robert
E. Hine, who was the issue of the testator and of the
life tenant. The remainder was not absolute, for if the
remainderman should die, and his mother, the life tenant,
remarry, this lot was to be sold and the-proceeds paid over
to certain collaterals named. Technically the interest was
a vested remainder, subject to open and let in the testator's brothers and sisters and to be divested upon the
death of Robert E. Hine and remarriage of the life tenant.
The contention now is that if the court erred in the construction of the will, or in the interpretation and application of the statute, and decreed a sale for reinvestment,
not strictly authorized by the statute, that its action and
decree is to be regarded as a nullity, that the sale is void,
and that the appointment of Waggaman as trustee and
the execution of his bond are absolute nullities.
But if we assume that upon a critical construction-of the
will and of the statute the bill seeking a sale of this property for reinvestment did not state a case clearly within
the statutory authority of the court, it does not necessarily follow that the decree of sale and all else that occurred are to be treated as mere nullities, subject to
collateral attacks such as this is.
The Supreme Court of the District is one of general
jurisdiction. It possesses all of the powers which by
statute are conferred upon the Circuit and District Courts
of the United States. Sections 760 and 765, Rev. Stat.

D. C. It may be said, indeed, to have the usual powers
incident to a court of equity at the date of the Revolution,
not incompatible with the changed form and principles
of government or affected by subsequent legislation.
Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 382.
The inherent power of a court of equity over the persons and estates of infants is very wide. For the purpose
of maintenance, the power over real estate is undoubtedly
more comprehensive than it is over the sale of real estate
for purposes of reinvestment, though manifestly for the
interest of the minor. The weight of authority seems to
be that it does not extend to sales merely because it shall
appear to be for the interest of the infant Bispham's
Equity, § 549; Story's Equity, § 1357; 3 Pomeroy Equity,
§§ 1304, 1309), though there is not lacking very respectable authority for the power to sell real estate when
shown to be for the manifest interest of the minor. 2

(Tenn.) 370, and 7 Baxt. (Tenn.) 502. The Supreme
Court of the District had jurisdiction over the subjectmatter, the res. It had jurisdiction over the parties. It
was, according to due course of equity proceeding, called
upon to examine the will and the statute which gave the
power to make the sale in certain circumstances. If then
jurisdiction consists in the power to hear and determine,
as has so many times been said, and the court errs in holding that a case has been made either under its inherent
power or its statutory authority, can it be said that it
has usurped jurisdiction and that its decrees are absolute
nullities? *To this we cannot consent. If the court was
one of general and not special jurisdiction, if under its inherent power, supplemented by statutory enlargement;
it had jurisdiction under any circumstances to sell the
real state of minors for reinvestment, it had jurisdiction
to examine and determine whether the particular application was within or beyond its authority. To do this

was jurisdiction. If it errs, its judgment is reversible by
proper appellate procedure. But its judgment, until it
be corrected, is a judgment, and cannot be regarded as a
nullity.
In the leading case of Ex parte Tobias Watkins, 3 Pet.
193, 203, 206, the opinion was by Chief Justice Marshall.
The question arose upon a writ of habeas corpus. The
petitioner had been indicted and convicted. He sought
to be discharged from prison because the indictment upon
its face charged no offense cognizable by courts of the
United States. The court said, among other things:
"An imprisonment under a judgment. cannot be unlawful, unless that judgment be an absolute nullity; and
it is not a nullity if the court has general jurisdiction of
the subject, although it should be erroneous. The Circuit
Court for the District of Columbia is a court of record,
having general jurisdiction over criminal cases. An
offense cognizable in any court, is cognizable in that
court. If the offense be punishable by law, that court is
competent to inflict the punishment. The judgment of
such a tribunal has all the obligation which the judgment
of any tribunal can have. To determine whether the
offense charged in the indictment be legally punishable
or not, is among the most unquestionable of its powers
and duties. The decision of this question is the exercise
of jurisdiction, whether the judgment be for or against the
prisoner. The judgment is equally binding in the one
case and in the other; and must remain in full force unless
reversed regularly by a superior court capable of reversing it."
After referring to and commenting upon Kempe's
Lessee v. Kennedy, 5 Cranch, 173, and Skillern's Executor
v. May's Executor, 6 Cranch, 267, the court added:
"Had any offense against the laws of the United States
been i'n fact committed, the Circuit Court for the District
of Columbia could take cognizance of it. The question

Opinion of the Court.

whether any offense was or was not committed, that is,
whether the indictment did or did not show that an
offense had been committed, was a question which that
court was competent to decide. If its judgment was
erroneous, a point which this court does not determine,
still it is a judgment, and, until reversed, cannot be disregarded."
This case was followed in Ex parte Parks, 93 U. S. 18, 23,
and in In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 757, where this court,
speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said of the language just
cited from Ex parte Watkins, that"It may be said that this language is too broad in
asserting that, because every court must pass upon its
own jurisdiction, such decision is itself the exercise of a
jurisdiction which belongs to it, and cannot, therefore,
be questioned in any other court. But we do not so understand the meaning of the court. It certainly was not
intended to say that because a Federal court tries a prisoner for an ordinary common law offense, as burglary,
assault and battery, or larceny, with no averment or
proof of any offense against the United States, or any
connection with a statute of the United States, and punishes him by imprisonment, he cannot be released by
habeas corpus because the court which tried him had
assumed jurisdiction.
"In all such cases, when the question of jurisdiction is
raised, the point to be decided is, whether the court has
jurisdiction of that class of offenses. If the statute has
invested th6 court which tried the prisoner with jurisdiction to punish a well-defined class of offenses, as forgery
of its bonds or perjury in its courts, its judgment as to
what acts were necessary under these statutes to constitute the crime is not reviewable on a writ of habeas
corpus."
The principle has been applied in many cases, notably
in cases in which want of jurisdiction as a court of the

United States was apparent on the record. Des Moines
Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U. S. 552, 557, 559; Dowell
v. Applegate, 152 U. S. 327, 337.
In McNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352, 365, the court, after
passing upon various jurisdictional objections to a judicial sale of a title in controversy, said:
"But there is a comprehensive and more conclusive
answer to all the objections to the sale which have been
considered, and to others suggested which have not been
adverted to.
"Upon the filing of the notice with the proof of publication, and the subsequent filing of the petition of the
administrator for authority to 'sell, the Circuit Court
had jurisdiction of the case. No presumption on that
subject is necessary. Jurisdiction is authority to hearand determine. It is an axiomatic proposition that when
jurisdiction has attached, whatever errors may subsequently occur in its exercise, the proceeding being coram
judice, can 'be impeached collaterally only for fraud. In
all other respects it is as conclusive as if it were irreversible in a proceeding for error. The order of sale before
us is within this rule. Grignon's Lessee v. Astor et al., 2
How. 341, was, like this, a case of a sale by an administrator. In that case, this court said: 'The purchaser
under it is not bound to look beyond the decree. If
there is error in it of the most palpable kind, if the court
which rendered it have, in the exercise of jurisdiction,
qisregarded, misconstrued, or disobeyed the plain provisions 'of the law which gave them the power to hear
and determine the case before them, the title of the purchaser is as much protected as if the adjudication would
stand the test of a writ of error;. and so where an appeal
is given, but not taken, in the time allowed by law.' This
case and the case of Voorhees v. The Bank of the United
States, 10 Pet. 449, are the leading authorities in this
.court upon'the subject. Other .and later cases have fol-

lowed and been controlled by them. Stow v. Kimball
affirms the same doctrine."
The line between a judgment which. is a plain usurpation of jurisdiction and one which is merely erroneous and
reviewable only by seasonable appeal, is a plain one.
The case in hand falls, in our judgment, within those which
are merely reversible upon appellate proceedings, and the
judgment decreeing the sale and appointing Waggaman
as trustee to make the sale was not a nullity.
In Voorhees v. Bank, 10 Pet. 449, 474, this. court said:
"The line which separates error in judgment from the
usurpation of power is very definite; and is precisely that
which denotes the" cases where a judgment or decree is
reversible only by an appellate court, or may be declared
a nullity collaterally when it is offered in evidence in an
action concerning the matter adjudicated, or purporting
to have been so. In the one case, it is a record importing
absolute -verity; in the other, mere waste paper. There
can be no middle character assigned to judicial proceedings which are irreversible for error. Such is their effect
between the parties to the suit; and such are the immunities which the law affords to a plaintiff who has obtained
an erroneous judgment or execution. It would be a wellmerited reproach to otir jurisprudence if an innocent purchaser, no party to the suit, who had paid his money on
the faith of an order of a, court, should not have the same
protection under an erroneous proceeding as the party
who derived the benefit accruing from it."

down that a judgment cannot be collaterally impeached

aside from the View we have expressed as to the
validity of the proceedings when collaterally attacked,
we are of opinion that the question of the validity of the
decree of sale, the order appointing Waggaman trustee
to make the sale, and the validity of the bond in suit is

not open to question by one who voluntarily became the
surety upon the bond, thereby enabling his principal to
obtain the proceeds of sale. Having obtained the trust
and confidence of the court by aid of the security afforded
by the solemn obligation to faithfully execute the order
of the court and to pay into the court the proceeds of
the sale which he undertook to make, neither the trustee
so appointed, nor the surety for his performance of the
trust, are in a situation to deny the regularity of the
transaction. The proceeds which Waggaman received
are either the funds of the beneficial owners of the property, or, if the sale be in fact void so far as to confer no
title, the purchaser in equity and justice must be protected before the money is distributed. The benefit which
Waggaman expected to secure, he has been enabled to
enjoy through the voluntary execution of this bond by
Clarkelas his surety. That bond recites his due appointment, and it would be inequitable and unjust to permit
either the principal or his surety to deny the fact.
This rule of estoppel has been applied in many cases.
It was applied in respect to the bond of an Indian agent.
The surety upon the bond denied liability because the
Government did not produce the commission showing the
appointment of his principal. The court' said: "The
bond upon which the suit was brought recites that he
was appointed Indian agent and the obligors in the bond
are therefore estopped from denying it." Bruce v. United
States, 17 How. 437, 442.
The principle was applied to a distiller's bond where
one of the defenses was that the bond was invalid. The
court said:
"But we prefer to place our judgment upon the broader
ground marked out by the adjudications of this court,
to which we have referred. Every one is presumed to
know the law. Ignorance standing alone can never be
the basis of a legal right. If a bond is liable to the objec-

tion taken in this case and the parties are dissatisfied, the
objection should be made when the bond is presented for
execution. If executed under constraint, the constraint
will destroy it. But where it is voluntarily entered into
and the principal enjoys the benefits which it is intended
to secure and a breach occurs, it is then too late to raise
the question of its validity. The parties are estopped from
availing themselves of such a defense. In such cases there
is neither injustice nor hardship in holding that the contract as made is the measure of the rights of the government and of the liability of the obligors." United States v.
Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 409.
It was applied in respect of a stay bond executed under
a void act of legislation. "Not to apply the principle of
estoppel to the bond in this case would," said the court,
"it seems to us, involve a mockery in judicial administration and a violation of the plainest principles of reason
and justice." Daniels v. Tearney, 102 U. S. 415, 422.
The opinions of the highest courts of the States are
full of applications of the rule of estoppel. In Plowman v.
Henderson, 59 Alabama, 559, the sureties upon the bond of
an administrator were not permitted to show the illegality
of his appointment. To the same effect is White v. Weatherbee, 126 Massachusetts, 450.
The sureties upon the bond of a sheriff were held
estopped to deny validity of his appointment or the regularity of his bond. Jones v. Gallatin County, 78 Kentucky,
491.
In People v. Norton, 9 N. Y. 176, the sureties uponothe
bond of a trustee appointed by a chancery court were
held estopped to deny the validity of the order appointing him.
In State v. Anderson, 16 Lea (Tenn.), 321, 335, and
United States v. Maurice, 2 Brock, 96, the rule is recognized and applied.
The questions which we have considered arose upon

a plea which set out the proceedings in the case in which
the bond had been taken, and averred their nullity for
want of jurisdiction. Another and distinct defense relied
upon in the plea was that after the proceeds of sale had
come into the possession of said Waggaman that Mattie
McC. Hine, one of -the beneficiaries for whose use this
suit is prosecuted by the United States, had agreed with
the said Waggaman that he should retain in his possession and for his own purposes the fund aforesaid, and
should pay to her interest at the rate of five per cent per
annum, quarterly. That this agreement was acted upon
and the interest so paid from the date of the receipt of
the proceeds in 1899 to May 1, 104, and that the agreement was without the knowledge or consent of the surety.
There'was a demurrer and joinder thereon to so much of
the said plea as set out and relied upon the nullity of
the proceedings under which the bond had been executed,
and a replication and issue upon the plea relying upon
any alleged agreement between Waggaman, the principal,
and Mrs. Hine, as one of the beneficiaries in the bond.
The demurrer was overruled and complainants electing to
stand upon it, declined to further plead; whereupon the
action was dismissed. From this judgment there was an
appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District, where the
judgment was affirmed.
So much of the plea as sought to defend the action in
whole or in part in consequence of the alleged agreement
between the principal in the bond and Mrs. Hine without
the consent of the surety remains at issue undisposed of,
and is accordingly not considered by us.
The.judgment of the Court of Appeals so far as it determined the validity of the plea aforesaid was erroneous,
and the case' is reversed and remanded with direction to
sustain the demurrer and remand the case for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
