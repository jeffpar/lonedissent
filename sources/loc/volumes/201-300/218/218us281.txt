KERFOOT v. FARMERS' AND MERCHANTS'
BANK.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 6.

Argued October 25, 1910.-Decided November'7, 1910.

In the absence of clear expression of legislative intention to the contrary, a conveyance of real estate to a corporation for a purpose not
authorized by its charter is not void, but voidable. The sovereign
Aene can object; the conveyance cannot be impugned by 'the
grantor, his heirs or third parties.
Although thd conveyance of real estate in this case to a national bank
was not one permitted by § 5137, Rev. Stat., title to the property
passed to the grantee for the purposes expressed in the conveyance
and that instrument cannot be attacked as void by an heir of the
grantor.
On writ of error to review the judgment of a state court holding that
a deed to a national bank was not void under the Federal statute,
this court will not review findings of the state court of fact as to the
acceptance of the deed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a transfer of
real estate to a national bank, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Homer Hall and Mr. Frank.Hall, with whom Mr.

George Hall was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The national banking act is an enabling act, and a
natio4al bank cannot exercise any powers except those
expressly granted by that act or such incidental powers
as are necessary to carry on the bpsiness of banking.

acquire or hold real estate is given by § 5137, Rev. Stat.,
under which it has no power or authority to accept or
hold the real estate for the purpose for which it was attempted to be conveyed in this case. The effort to convey the real estate in question being beyond the powers
given to the bank to accept and hold the same, the proceedings, therefore, were an absolute nullity; there was
no acceptance of the deed by it, and no title vested in
it. See cases supra and Pittsburg & Cinn. Ry. Co. v.
Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co., 131 U. S. 371; Merchants'
Nat. Bank v. Wehrmann, 202 U. S. 295; First Nat. Bank

The making of the deed and sending it to the cashier
of the defendant national bank being absolutely void, the
same can be taken advantage of by any person whose
interests are involved. National Bank v. Matthews, 98
U. S. 621; Union Gold Mining Co. v. National Bank, 96
U. S. 640, have no application\to the facts in this case.
These and the cases of National Bank v. Whitney, 103
U. S. 99; Schuyler National Bank v. Gadsden, 191 U. S.
451, and similar cases, relate to the taking of real estate
security for loans made by national banks.
This is not a question as to the power of a national
hank to loan money on real estate security. It involves
an entirely different principle which is clearly distinguishable. California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, 167 U. S. 363;
McCormick v. Market National Bank, 165 U. S. 538.
Plaintiff in error is neither a third person in law nor a
stranger to the transaction, but is a privy of the maker
of the deed both in blood and in estate. Stacy v. Thrasher

The transaction being ultra vires and void for want of
authority in the defendant national bank, and of its
cashier, to accept the deed or title to the property, either
party to the transaction can avail himself of this want
of authority.
Plaintiff contends that said state court erred in deciding and holding that the cashier of the defendant bank
had the authority to accept said deed from the original
maker thereof.
If the cashier had authority to accept the deed for the
bank, it was by his general authority in his ordinary
business as cashier, otherwise no title vested in the bank
and the transaction was a nullity. United States v. City
Bank of Columbia, 21 How. 356, 366; Bank of United
States v. Dunn, 6 Pet. 51; Western Nat. Bank v. Armstrong,
152 U. S. 346; Norton v. Derby Nat. Bank, 61 N. H. 589;
Bank of Commerce v. Hart, 37 Nebraska, 197; Bank of
Healdsburgv. Bailhache, 65 California, 329.
The fact that no loss resulted from this particular
transaction affords, no jurisdiction or excuse for the
illegal and unauthorized act. There could be no end to
the loss or injury that might result from such a precedent.
The accepting of this deed was not one of the incidental
powers necessary to carry on the business of banking,
nor was it accepted as a security for a past indebtedness
or purchased under judgment in favor of the bank.
Neither was it for the purpose of owning a banking house
of its own for, as heretofore stated, the bank continued
to pay rent as a tenant to the grantor, and the cashier
and vice-president immediately after receiving the deed
attempted to convey the property away.
There is no evidence that the defendant bank, its
officers, except its vice president and cashier) or its board
of directors ever knew of this attempted conveyance,

much less ratified the same. There could have been no
ratification of the same. The act was unapthorized and
beyond its powers, illegal and void, and was incapable of
ratification. See cases supra; Western Nat. Bank v. Armstiong, 152 U. S'346.
The attempted conveyance of the property by Kerfoot
to the bank and the acceptance of the deed by the cashier
of the bank being ultra .vires no title to the property
passed from Kerfoot or vested in the bank, because the
bank not only did not, but could not accept, the deed or
the title to the property. There was neither a delivery
nor an acceptance of the deed. Hall v. Hall, 107 Missouri,

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This action was brought in 1804, in the Circuit Court
of Grundy County, State of Missouri, to set aside a deed
of real property made by James H. Kerfoot to the First
National Bank of Trenton, Missouri, and also a deed by
which that bank purported to convey the same property
to the defendants Hervey Kerfoot, Alwilda Kerfoot and
Lester R. Kerfoot, and for the recovery of possession.
The plaintiffs in the action, which was brought shortly
after the death of James H. Kerfoot, were Homer Hall,
administrator of his estate, and Robert Earl Kerfoot, his
infant grandson, who claimed to be his only heir at law
and sued by Homer Hall as next friend. The petition contained two counts, one in equity, the other in ejectment.
Upon the trial the Circuit Court found the issues for defendants and the judgment in their favor was affirmed by.
the Supreme Court of Missouri. 145 Missouri, 418. On
his coming of age Robert Earl Kerfoot sued out this writ
of error.
The plaintiff in error challenges the conveyance made
by James H. Kerfoot to the bank, upon the ground that
under § 5137 of the Revised Statutes of the United States,

relating to national banks, the bank was without power
to take the property, and hence that no title passed by the
deed, but that it remained in the grantor and descended
to the plaintiff in error as his heir at law. It appears that
the deed, which was absolute in form, with warranty and
expressing a substantial consideration, was executed in
pursuance of an arrangement by which the title to the
property was to be held in trust to be conveyed upon
the direction of the grantor; and the Supreme Court of
Missouri decided that a trust was in fact declared by the
grantor in favor of Hervey, Alwilda and Lester R. Kerfoot, to whom ran a quitclaim deed, which he prepared
and forwarded to the bank to be signed and acknowledged
by it and then returned to him.
But while the purpose of this transaction was not one
of those described in the statute for which a national
bank may purchase and hold real estate, it does not follow
that the deed was a nullity and that it failed to convey
title to the property.
In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intention to the contrary, a conveyance of real estate to a corporation for a purpose n ot authorized by its charter, is
not void, but voidable, and the sovereign alone can object.
Neither the grantor nor his heirs nor third persons can
impugn it upon the-ground that the grantee has exceeded
its powers. Smith v. Sheeley, 12 Wall. 358; NationalBank
v. Matthews, 98 U. S. 621; National Bank v. Whitney, 103
U. S. 99; Reynolds v. Crawfordsville Bank, 112 U. S. 405;
Fritts v. Palmer, 132 U. S. 282; Leazure v. Hillegas, 7 Serg.
& R. (Pa.) 313. Thus, although the statute by clear implication forbids a national bank from making a loan upon
real estate, the security is not void and it cannot be successfully assailed by the debtor or by subsequent mortgagees because the bank was without authority to take it;
and the disregard of the provisions of the act of Congress
upon that subject only lays the bank open to proceedings

KERFOOT v. FARMERS' & MERCHANTS' BK. 287

Opinion of the Court.

by the Government for exercising powers not conferred
by law. National Bank v. Matthews, supra; National
Bank v. Whitney, supra; Swope v. Leffingwell, 105 U. S. 3.
In National Bank v. Matthews, supra, viewing that case
in this aspect, the court said:
"The opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri assumes that the loan was made upon real-estate security
within the meaning of the statute, and their judgment is
founded upon that view. These things render it proper
to consider the case in that aspect. But, conceding them
to be as claimed, the consequence insisted upon by no
means necessarily follows. The statute does not declare
such a security void. It is silent upon the subject. If
Congress so meant, it would have been easy to say so; and
it is hardly to be believed that this would not have been
done, instead of leaving the question to be settled by the
uncertain result of litigation and judicial decision. Where
usurious interest is contracted for, a forfeiture is prescribed and explicitly defined.
C"Where a corporation is incompetent by its charter to
take a title to real estate, a conveyance to it is not void,
but only voidable, and the sovereign alone can object.
It is valid until assailed in a direct proceeding instituted
for that purpose. Leazure v. Hillegas, 7 Serg. & R. (Pa.)
313; Goundie v. Northampton Water Co., 7 Pa. St. 233;
Runyon v. Coster, 14 Pet. 122; The Banks v. Poitiaux, 3
Rand. (Va.) 136; Mclndoe v. The City of St. Louis, 10
Missouri, 575, 577. See also Gold Mining Co. v. Natidnal
Bank, 96 U. S.640."
This rule, while recognizing the authority of the Government to which the corporation is amenable, has the
salutary effect of assuring the security of titles and of
avoiding the injurious consequences which would otherwise result. In the present case a trust was declared and
this trust should not be permitted to fail and the property

to be diverted from those for whom it was intended, by
treating the conveyance to the bank as a nullity, in the
absence of a clear statement of legislative intent that it
should be so regarded.
The cases in this court, which are relied upon by the
plaintiff in error, are not applicable to the facts here
presented and are in no W-ay inconsistent with the doctrine
to which we hjave referred. McCormick v. Market Bank,
165 U. S. 538; CaliforniaBank v. Kennedy, 167 U. S. 362;
Concord First National Bank v. Hawkins, 174 U. S. 364.
It was also urged by the plaintiff in error that the deed
was not accepted by the bank, and was inoperative for
that reason. The Supreme Court of Missouri held upon
the evidence that it was accepted, and this court, on a
question of that character, does not review the findings
of fact which have been made in the state court. WatersPierce Oil Co. v. State of Texas, 212 U. S. 86; Egan v. Hart,
165 U. S. 188; Clipper Mining Co. v. Eli Mining & Land
Co., 194 U. S. 220.
Assuming that the deed was accepted by the bank, it
was effective to pass the legal title, and the plaintiff in
error as heir at law of the grantor cannot question it.
Judgment afirmed.
