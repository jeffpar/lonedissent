SAME v. LYNCH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF

VERMONT.
No. 27.

Submitted November 2, 1910.-Decided November 7, 1910.

Decided on authcrity of International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S.
91.

Mr. David C. Harringtonfor plaintiff in error.
No briefs filed for defendants in error.
Per Curiam: Substantially the same question of Federal
law involved in these two cases arose under a Kansas
statute in International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S.
91;' and the Federal right asserted in that case was sustained. There is no difference in principle between the
two cases last named 'and the Pigg case, although the
Federal question involved in them arises under the statutes, respectively, of other States-Wisconsin and Vermont. In view of the pleadings and the conceded facts
in these cases the judgment in each of them must be reversed on the authority of the Pigg case, and the cases sre
severally remanded for such further proceedings as is required by and is not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
