OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

gone before, the contentions now advanced against the
correctness of the judgment are so wholly without merit
as not to require further argument. The motion to affirm
must therefore prevail.
Affirmed.

GRIFFITH, alias GRIFFIN v. STATE OF

CONNECTICUT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS OF THE.
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.
No. 515.

Motion to dismiss or affirm. Submitted November 28, 1910.
Decided December 12, 1910.

Decided on authority of Griffith v. Connecticut, ante, p. 563.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. I. Henry Harrisfor plairitiff in error.
Mr. Hugh M. Alcorn for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

The parties to this record are the same as in. No. 514,
just decided, ante, p. 563, and the questions involved are
the same, the prosecution being for similar offenses against
the Connecticut act of 1907. Both cases were tried together. Upon the conviction in this, however, the trial
cotirt imposed the penalty of imprisonment. The two
cases were disposed of by the Supreme Court of Errors in
one opinion. As the decision in No. 514 is n~cessarily
controlling, it follows that the judgment-of the Supreme
Court of Errors of Connecticut must be and it is
Affirmed.
