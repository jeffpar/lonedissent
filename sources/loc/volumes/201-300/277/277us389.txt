that supports the construction for which they contend.
In the absence of some definite indication of that purpose,
the Senate may not reasonably be held to have intended
to depart from its established usage. Authority to exert
the powers of the Senate to compel production of evidence
differs widely from authority to invoke judicial power for
that purpose. The phrase "such other acts as may be
necessary" may-not be taken to include everything that
under any circumstances might be covered by its words.
The meaning of the general language employed is to be
confined to acts belonging to the same general class as
those specifically authorized. Oates v. National Bank,
100 U. S. 239, 244. Barrett v. Van Pelt, 268 U. S. 85, 90.
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. United States, ante, p.
291. The-context, the established practice of the Senate
to rely on its own powers, and the attending circumstances
oppose the construction for which petitioners contend and
show that the Senate did not intend to authorize the committee, or anticipate that there might be need, to invoke
the power of the Judicial Department.. Petitioners are
not "authorized by law to sue."

QUAKER CITY CAB COMPANY v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 139. Argued April 20, 1928.-Decided May 28, 1928.
A law of Pennsylvania (Pa. L. 1889, 420, 431; Pa. St., 1920, ยง 20,388)

provides that a tax be laid on the gross receipts derived- by foreign
or domestic corporations from their operation of taxicabs in intrastate transportation of passengers, but does not tax the like receipts
of individuals and partnerships in the same kind of business.
Held:
1. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extends
to foreign corporations within the jurisdiction of the State, and

safeguards to them protection of laws applied equally to all in the
same situation. P. 400.
2. The equal protection clause does not detract from the right of the
State justly to exert its taxing power or prevent it from adjusting
its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in
that connection, but it does require that the classification be not
arbitrary but based on a real and substantial difference having a
reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation. Id.
3. The right to withhold from a foreign corporation permission to do
local business therein does not enable the State to require such a
corporation to surrender the protection of the Federal Constitution. Id.
4. Characterization of a tax by the state court is not binding here.
P. 401.
5. The practical operation of the taxing provision is to be regarded,
and it is to be dealt with, according to its effect. Id.
6. The tax is not of a kind peculiarly applicable to corporations, as
are taxec on their capital stock or franchises, nor a tax taken in
lieu of any other tax or used as a measure of one intended to fall
elsewhere, but is specifically and solely a tax on gross receipts,
which could be laid on receipts belonging to natural persons quite
as conveniently as on those of corporations. The discrimination,
made to depend entirely upon the fact that the receipts taxed belong to corporations, and not justified by any difference in the
source of the receipts or in the situation or character of the property employed; rests on a purely arbitrary basis. P. 402.
7. The provision of the state enactment violates the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth -Amendment. Id.

ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, affirming a judgment of the Court of Common
Pleas, 29 Dauphin Co. Rep. 00, against the Cab Company and in favor of the State, on the Cab Company's

Argument for the Cab Company.

In such a case as this, valid tax classification cannot
rest solely upon the character of the operator (that is,
whether it be corporate or non-corporate), when there is
no other difference in the situation or the circumstances
of the operators. The tax is not of a kind peculiar to
corporations. It is unlike a capital stock tax, which of
necessity can apply only to artificial taxpayers, or an excise tax. Even in Pennsylvania this distinction is important. Schoyer v. Comet Oil Co., 284 Pa. 189.
In Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, 251 U. S. 532,
the tax was a capital stock tax, which obviously can belevied only upon corporations and other associations having the characteristics of corporations. If the principle
should be extended, then there is no reason why corporations cannot be classified for the purpose of paying any
tax. Real estate and personal property taxes could be
levied on real estate and personal property only when
owned by corporations. In fact, all taxes could be levied
only upon corporate beings.
The tax is not an excise, a privilege, or a license tax.
Commonwealth v. HarrisburgLight & Power Co., 284 Pa.
175. This Court itself definitely held that this tax was
not a privilege tax. Phila.& Southern Mail S. S. Co. v.
Commonwealth, 122 U. S. 326.
The present statute which repealed the acts involved in
that case, made no change in the nature of the tax, but
only followed the rule there announced and limited the
tax to the "gross receipts . . . received from passengers
and freight traffic transported wholly within this State."
In dealing with excise, license, and privilege taxes, the
latitude is very broad, and purely artificial selections have
been sustained which -are not sanctioned with respect to
other taxes. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107,
the Court made it clear that the tax was sustained not
because it was imposed on the business (which it ad-

mitted was the same "whether conducted by individuals
or corporations ") but because it was imposed only on
the privilege of conducting the business in corporate
form. Other leading cases like the onp last cited are:
Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S 283;
Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, 192 U. S. 39.7;
Ohio Tax Cases, 232 U. S. 576; Cheney Bros. & Co. v.
Massachusetts,246 U. S. 147; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts,
260 U. S. 519; Roberts & Schaeffer Co. v. Emmerson,
271 U. S. 50.
But broad as seems to be the power of selection in the
imposition of such taxes, there is a limit. In Southern
Ry. Co. v. Greene, 216 U. S. 400, an additional franchise
tax on foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business was held invalid. See Bethlehem Motors Corp'n v.
Flynt, 256 U. S. 421, which completely answers the contention that plaintiff in error can avoid taxation by surrendering its charter and operating as a general partnership. This it cannot do, with its outstanding obligations,
any more easily that the foreign corporations could comply with the arbitrary terms of the North Carolina statute; with which that case dealt. See Air Way Electric
Appliance Corp'n v. Day, 266 U. S. 71.
The classification being based solely upon whether the
taxicab operator is an artificial being, it is arbitrary and
illegally discriminatory. The discrimination is real. The
corporate taxicab operator pays every tax which the noncorporate taxicab operator pays. In addition, the corporate (domestic and foreign) operator pays a capital stock
tax of 5 mills upon the actual value of its capital stock
and a bonus of 1/3 of 1% on the par value of all issued
stock, if it be a domestic corporation, or 1/3 of 1% on the
amount of capital actually employed in Pennsylvania, if
it be a foreign corporation.
The case at bar, therefore, is totally unlike General
American Tank Car Corp'n v. Day, 270 U. S. 367, where

QUAKER CITY CAB CO. v. PENNA.
389

393

Argument for the Cab Company.

the special tax of 25 mills on the dollar of the assessed
value of the rolling stock of foreign corporations was in
lieu of all other state taxes which averaged approximately
25 mills.
In dealing with taxes other than (1) taxes peculiar to
corporations and (2) excise, license, or privilege taxes,
this Court has consistently taken the stand that, while
the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose upon the
legislature an iron rule of equal taxation, it does impose
the rational constitutional rule that so-called classifications cannot be made solely with reference to the character of the taxpayer; that-is, whether it is a natural or
an artificial person. CaliforniaR. R. Tdx Cases,, 13 Fed.
722, (dismissed by compromise, County of San Mateo v.
Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 116 U. S. 138); County of
Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 18 Fed. 385,
(affirmed on another ground, Santa Clara County v.
Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 118 U. S. 394, but see concurring opinion, and Guthrie, Fourteenth Amendment, p.
121); Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S.

v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412; Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270
U. S. 230; Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Harding, 272 U. S.
494.
The rule that the legislature may exempt from the general class a particular group which operates for a distinctly different purpose, as in Citizens Telephone Co. v.
Fuller, 229 U. S. 322, is only application of the same general principle which permits- the legislature, if it chooses,
to "exempt certain classes of property from any taxation
at all, such as churches, libraries, and the property of
charitable institutions." Bell's Gap R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232.
The same rule was applied in Northwestern Mut. Life
Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, 247 U. S. 132, where an annual

license tax on level premium life insurance companies was
sustained although fraternal and beneficial societies having lodges and insuring only the lives of members were
exempt.
The decisions of state courts condemn a classification
based solely upon whether the taxpayer is a corporation
or a natural person. Russell v. Croy, 164 Mo. 69; Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Middlekamp, 1 F. (2d) 563;
Gamble-RobinsonFruit Co. v. Thoresen, 53 N. D. 28.
The several state constitutions contain provisions relative to uniformity of taxation. While they are expressed
in different language, the basic idea is to protect taxpayers from unfair and arbitrary classifications and discriminations. The following cases, we believe, establish
the rule that the classification made in the case at bar is
wholly arbitrary and illusory. Pullman Palace Car Co.
v. Texas, 64 Tex. 274; Parkerv. North British & M. Ins.
Co., 42 La. Ann. 428; Adams v. Yazoo & MississippiValley R. R. Co., 77 Miss. 194; State v. Stonewall Ins. Co.,

Std. ]ife & Accident Ins. Co. v. Detroit, 95 Mich. 466;
Danville v. Quaker Maid, 211 Ky. 677.
The discrimination in this statute is clear and hostile
against the corporate taxicab operators and is of an unusual character unknown to the practice in Pennsylvania.

Baldridge was on the brief, for defendant in error.
The construction put by the court below upon the
statutes and constitution of its own State is not open to
review in this Court. The Pennsylvania court held
the plaintiff in error to be a transportation corporation,
operating a device for the transportation of passengers

Argument for the State.

and their luggage upon the public highways and therefore within the terms of the section and subject to the
tax. The transportation -of passengers or freight, or
both, is the business which the companies named are empowered by law to transact, which, in the case of the
plaintiff in error, is the business authorized by its charter,
and which the State permitted it, as a foreign corporation, to perform within its borders, and for which the
Public Service Commission granted it a certificate of
public convenience. The sole business of the plaintiff in
error is that of the transportation of passeligers and their
luggage solely within the State. To the receipts of such
business alone was the rate of taxation applied to determine the amount of the tax. Under the act if plaintiff
in error had had no receipts from such business, it would
not have been liable for the payment of any tax.
"The tax," as was said in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220
U. S. 107, "is not payable unless there be a carrying on
or doing of business in the designated capacity, and this
is made the occasion for the tax, measured by the standard prescribed."
That the tax is not a property tax is clear, not only from
the language of ยง 23 but also by the construction placed
upon it by the Supreme Court. This view is strengthened
by the fact that a capital stock tax, which is a property
tax, is imposed upon such companies- under ยงยง 20 and 21
,of the same act (changed by subsequent legislation-as to
the method of computing and determining the amount).
It is a tax upon the business of the companies measured
in amount by the gross receipts or income resulting from
the.conduct and, operation of such business. It is a tax
upon the doing of a business and in respect to a carrying
on thereof, in 'a sum equivalent to eight mills upon each
dollar of the gross receipts received from the transacting
or performing of such business. It is not a tax upon the.
property of the corporation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for the State.

277 U. S.

The tax is imposed upon both domestic and foreign
corporations, and is confined to business done solely
within the State. All within the class are treated alike.
Hence the issue turns upon the power of the State to
classify, and whether or not the classification made by the
act rests upon a reasonable basis and is not illusory or
arbitrary. Is the particular classification open to objection because it precludes the assumption that it was made
in the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion?
The principles governing the application of the Fourteenth Amendment were considered in Bell's Gap R. R.
Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232; Keeney v. New York,
222 U. S. 525; St. Louis, etc. R. R. v. Arkansas ex rel.
Norwood, 235 U. S. 350; Maxwell v. Bugbee, 250 U. S.
525; Swiss Oil Corp'nv. Shanks, 273 U. S. 407.
Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, is conclusive in
this case.
The Pennsylvania tax is limited and confined to the
precise business for which the companies made subject to
the tax were created and were permitted to transact
within the borders of the State. Plaintiff in error is required further to secure from the Public Service Commission of the State a certificate of public convenience to
use the public highways as prescribed in such certificate
and the law authorizing its issue. The tax is not payable
by the corporation unless it is carrying on or doing business in the designated capacity of a transportation company, and, as was said by this Court in Flint v. Stone
Tracy Co., supra, "this is made the occasion for the tax,
measured by the standard prescribed"; and if there be
no receipts from such corporate activity there is no tax.
Is this not conclusive in this case?
Having in mind the facts that plaintiff in error is a foreign corporation and is engaged solely in an intrastate
business in Pennsylvania, and that it is taxed, as are

QUAKER CITY CAB CO. v. PENNA.
389

397

Argument for the State.

domestic corporations, solely with reference to the receipts of such business and in the same manner as domestic corporations, and that the State of Pennsylvania had
the power to exclude it from the operation of its business
within the State (Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648)
and, therefore, the.power to prescribe the conditions and
limitations of its business operations within the State,
and that the present law was an ingredient of the Pennsylvania system of taxation many years prior to the entrance of plaintiff in error to Pennsylvania,-especially
pertinent is the language of, this Court in Crescent Oil
Co. v. Mississippi, 257 U. S. 129. See also Horn Silver
Mining Co. v. New York, 143 U. S. 305; Paul v. Virginia,
8 Wall. 168; New York v. Roberts, 171 U. S. 658; BrownForman Co. v. Kentucky, 217 U. S. 563; Southwestern
Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114; Pacific Express Co. V.
Seibert, 142 U. S. 339; Metropolitan Street Ry. Co. v.
New York, 199 U. S. 1.
The classification is valid, whether the tax be regarded
as an excise upon the business of the companies, their
activities in the State, or a tax upon the franchise or
privilege of doing business in the State, or as a property
tax. The construction placed upon the act and the Constitution of the State by the state court is accepted by
this Court.
The tax is not imposed upon the gross receipts as property, but only in respect of the carrying on of the business. Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, 192 U. S.
397. If there be no gross receipts7from transportation
wholly within the State, there is no tax. There is no tax
payable unless there is a carrying on or doing of business
in the designated capacity. Phila. S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326, distinguished. Horn Silver Mining
Co. v. New York, 143 U. S. 305; St. Louis, etc., R. R. v.

Receipts, 15 Wail. 284.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

The principles and policy of the law of taxation in
Pennsylvania are. fairly outlined in C6mmonwealth V.
Sharon Coal Co., 164 Pa. 304; Commonwealth v. Brewing
Co., 145 Pa. 83; Seabolt v. Commissioners, 187 Pa. 318;
Commonwealth v. Delaware Division Canal Co., 123 Pa.
594. It is significant that, while the. tax upon the business of certain classes of corporations measured by their
gross receipts has been in force in Pennsylvania many
years, and several of the statutes imposing it have been
before this Court (see State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall. 284; Phila.S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania,122
U. S. 326), it does not appear that any such contention
was made as is made in the present case.
Authorities invoked to support an argument that a tax
on an incident or function of property is a direct tax
upon'the property itself simply show that the States
cannot, directly or indirectly burden the exercise by Congress of the powers committed to it by the Constitution,
nor may Congress burden the agencies or instrumentalities employed by the States in the exercise of their power.
Such doctrine does not in any way affect the instant case.
Assuming, for the purpose of argument, that the tax
imposed is a tax upon property; how stands the case of
plaintiff in error? It appears that the authorities cited
by it not only do not support its contention, but on the
contrary expressly negative it.

Judgment was entered in the Court of Common Pleas

Opinion of the Court.

The provisions here material are printed in the margin
The gross receipts taxed were derived by plaintiff in error
from the use of its motor vehicles for the transportation
within Pennsylvania of persons and their luggage.
Plaintiff in error contended 'that ifapplied to such receipts the section- violates the equal protection clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The highest court of the
State upheld the Act and affirmed the judgment. 287
Pa. 161..
Plaintiff in error is a New Jersey corporation authorized
to do business in Pennsylvania as a foreign corporation;
and, since June 1, 1917, it has carried on a general taxicab
business in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court held that
the section taxes gross receipts from the operation of
taxicabs. It provides that every transportation company, whether incorporated in Pennsylvania or elsewhere,
owning or operating any device for the transportation of
passengers, "shall pay to the state treasurer a tax of eight
mills upon the dollar upon the gross receipts of said corporation . . . received from passengers . . . transported wholly within this State
"
Plaintiff in error was subject to competition in its
business by individuals and partnerships operating taxicabs. The Act does not apply to them, and no tax is
imposed on their receipts. Corporations operating taxicabs are not exempted-from any of the taxes imposed on

natural persons carrying on that business. And every
such corporation whether domestic or foreign pays a
capital stock tax of five mills on the actual value of its
capital stock and a bonus of one-third of one per cent
on the par value of al stock issued if it be a domestic
corporation, and a like rate on its capital employed in
Pennsylvania if it be a foreign corporation. Act of July
22, 1913, P. L. 903. ยง 1, Act of May 3, 1899, P. L. 189.
ยง 1, Act of May 8, 1901, P. L. 150. The Supreme Court
said that it is immaterial whether individuals engaged in
a like taxicab business are subject to the tax here involved
and that corporations may be placed in a class separate
from individuals and so taxed.
The equal protection clause extends to foreign corporations within the jurisdiction of the State and safeguards
to them protection of laws applied equally to all in the
same situation. Plaintiff in error is entitled in Pennsylvania to the same protection of equal laws that natural
persons within its jurisdiction have a right to demand
under like circumstances. Kentucky Finance Corp'n .v.
ParamountExch., 262 U. S. 544, 550. The equal protection clause does not detract from the right of the State
justly to exert its taxing power or prevent it from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid
classification in that connection, "but it does require
that the classification be not arbitrary but based on a
real and substantial difference having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation." Power
Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, 493. It is established that
a corporation, by seeking and obtaining permission to
do business in a State does not thereby become bound to
comply with, or estopped from objecting to, the enforcement of its enactments that conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The right to withhold from a
foreign corporation permission to do local business therein
does not enable the State to require such a corporation

245 U. S. 178, 188. Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, 235 U. S.
197, 203.
The section declares the imposition to be a tax "upon
gross receipts." And the Supreme Court said: " The real
subject of the tax is -the gross receipts of a company engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers
" That statement is not affected by a later
expression referring to the tax as a "state tax on business
or income" in contrast with a "local tax on property"
such as hacks, cabs and other vehicles. The variation of
language used by the court evidently is intended to be,
and is, without significance.: The words of the section are
too plain to require explanation. They could not reasonably be given any other meaning. But, in any event, a
characterization of the tax by the state court is not binding here. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, ante,
p. 32. St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U. S.
346, 348. There is no controversy as to the application of
the tax. Plaintiff in error assumes that the section covers
its gross r6ceipts, as held by the state court, but insists
that the section. is invalid because it does not extend to
like receipts of natural persons and partnerships. No
doubt there are situations in which, as appears in Cudahy
Packing Co. v. Minnesota, 246 U. S. 450, and other cases,
a percentage of gross earnings may be taken as a tax on
property used in the business and properly may be deemed
not to be-a tax or burden on such earnings. But the
practical operation of the section is to be regarded, and it
is to be dealt with according to its effect. Frick v. Pennsylvania, 268 U. S. 473. PanhandleOil Co. v. Mississippi,

ante, p. 218. Here the tax is one that can be laid upon
receipts belonging to a natural person quite as conveniently as upon those of a corporation. It is not peculiarly
applicable to corporations as are taxes on their capital
stock or franchises. It is not taken in lieu of any other
tax or used as a measure of one intended to fall elsewhere.
It is laid upon and is to be considered and tested as a tax
on gross receipts; it is specifically that and nothing else.
In effect ยง 23 divides those operating taxicabs into two
classes. The gross receipts of incorporated operators are
taxed while those of natural persons and partnerships
carrying on the same business are not. The character of
the owner is the sole fact on which the distinction and
discrimination are made to depend. The tax is imposed
merely because the owner is a corporation. The discrimination is not justified by any difference in the source of
the receipts or in the situation or character of the property
employed. It follows that the section fails to meet the
requirement that a classification to be consistent with the
equal protection clause must be based on a real and substantial difference having reasonable relation to the subject of the legislation. Power Co. v. Saunders, supra.
No decision of this Court gives support to such a classification.* In no view can it be held to have more than an
arbitrary basis. As construed and applied by the state
court in this case, the section violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See The
RailroadTax Cases, 13 Fed. 722. County of Santa Clara
v. Southern Pacific. R. R. Co., 18 Fed. 385. Northern
Pacific R. Co. v. Walker, 47 Fed. 681. The tax cannot be
sustained.
Judgment reversed.
*And the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has condemned such a
classification. Schoyer v. Comet Oil & Refining Co., 284 Pa. 189,

HOLMES and BRANms, JJ., dissenting.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES.

I think that the judgment should be affirmed. The
principle that I think should govern is the same that I
stated in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, ante,
p. 41. Although this principle was not applied in that
case I do not suppose it to have been denied that taxing acts like other rules of law may be determined by
differences of degree, and that to some extent States may
have a domestic policy that they constitutionally may enforce. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U. S. 59. If
usually there is an important difference of degree between
the business done by corporations and that done by individuals, I see no reason why the larger businesses may not
be taxed and the small ones disregarded, and I think it
would be immaterial if here and there exceptions were
found to the general rule. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220
U. S. 107, 158, et seq. Citizens Telephone Co. v. Fuller,
229 U. S. 322. Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, 231
U. S. 373, 393. Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373, 384. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, 240 U. S. 510, 517. Furthermore if the State desired to discourage this form of

the State since 1864 to subject some kinids of businesses
conducted by corporations to heavier taxation than other
businesses conducted by corporations 2 Pursuant to this
policy, the legislature of Pennsylvania laid, in 1889, upon
public service corporations furnishing transportation for
hire, a gross receipts tax of eight mills on each dollar of
gross receipts earned wholly within the State. Act of
June 1, 1889, P. L. 1889, pp. 420, 431 (Pa. Stat. 1920,
ยง 20,388). That statute has remained unchanged so far
as affects the question here involved.' It applies equally
to every corporation engaged in the same kind of business, and makes no discrimination between foreign and
domestic corporations. But neither this specific tax, nor
any equivalent tax, is laid upon individuals or partnerships engaged in the same business. Nor-is this tax or an
equivalent laid upon corporations which supply certain
other public services.
The Supreme Court of the State has construed this
statute as applicable to all taxicab corporations; and has
held the Quaker City Cab Company, a foreign corporation doing an intrastate business in Pennsylvania since the
year 1917, liable for the taxes accrued on that business
and Federal Constitution, to place heavier tax burdens on corporations than on individuals. See Kittanning Coal Co. v. Commonwealth,

Act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, which was before this Court in Philadelphia & Southern Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326.

for the last six months of 1923, which was agreed on as
a test period. The Company claims that the statute
as construed and applied violates the Federal Constitution. There is no contention that it violates either the
commerce clause or the due process clause. The claim
is that it denies equal protection of the laws; and the
contention is rested specifically upon the ground that the
exaction "is not a tax peculiar to corporations." As the statute applies equally to domestic and to foreign corporations, cases like Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene,
216 U. S. 400; Kentucky Finance Corporationv. Paramount Auto Exchange, 262 U. S. 544; Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, 272 U. S. 494; and Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, have no application. And no claim is made that the Federal Constitution prevents a State from taxing corporations engaged
in one class of business more heavily than those engaged
in another. Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S.
114; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, 217 U. S. 563;
Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245; Oliver Iron
Mining Co. v. Lord, 262 U. - S. 172. The fundamental
question requiring decision is a general one. Does the
equality clause prevent a State from imposing a heavier
burden of taxation upon corporations engaged exclusively
in intrastate commerce, than upon individuals engaged
under like circumstances in the same kind of business?
The narrower question presented is, whether this heavier
burden may be imposed by a form of tax "not peculiarly
applicable to corporations." That is, by a tax of such a
character that it might have been extended to individuals
if the legislature had seen fit to do so.
The equality clause does not forbid a State to classify
for purposes of taxation. Discrimination through classification is said to violate-that clause only where it is such
as "to preclude the assumption that it was made in the
exercise of legislative judgment and discretion." Stebbins

v. Riley, 268 U. S. 137, 143. In other words, the equality
clause requires merely that the classification shall be reasonable. We call that action reasonable which an informed, intelligent, just-minded, civilized man could rationally favor. In passing upon legislation assailed under
the equality clause we have declared that the classification must rest upon a difference which is real, as distinguished from one which is seeming, specious, or fanciful,
so that all actually situated similarly will be treated alike;
that the object of the classification must be the accomplishment of a purpose or the promotion of a policy, which
is within the permissible functions of the State; and that
the difference must bear a relation to the object of the
legislation which is substantial, as distinguished from one
which is speculative, remote or negligible. Subject to
this limitation of reasonableness, the equality clause has
left unimpaired, both in range and in flexibility, the
State's power to classify for purposes of taxation. Can
it be said that the classification here in question is
unreasonable?
The difference between a business carried on in corporate
form and the same business carried on by natural persons
is, of course, a real and important one. As was stated in
Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S.107, 161-162, "it could

ence between carrying on of business by the corporations
taxed, and the same business when conducted by a private firm or individual. The thing taxed is not the mere
dealing in merchandise, in which the actual transactions

may be the same, whether conducted by individuals or
corporations, but the tax is laid upon the privileges which
exist in conducting business with the advantages which
inhere in the corporate capacity of those taxed, and which
are not enjoyed by private firms or individuals." Because
of this difference Congress has repeatedly discriminated
against incorporated concerns and in favor of the unincorporated. The Corporation Tax Act of August 5, 1909,
c. 6, ยง 38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, imposed a tax of one per cent
on the net.income of corporations when a corresponding
tax was not imposed upon the income of individuals.
Since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment the net
income of both corporations and individuals has been subjected to taxes of the same nature; but the tax imposed
has discriminated heavily against at least many of the
businesses which are incorporated.'

means of an annual tax in the form of a franchise tax de5 Under the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, ยงยง 1, 4,

1918, 10% thereafter; the excess profits tax imposed by ยง 301 of the

clared to be for the privilege of doing business in corporate form is common, and since Home Insurance Co. v.
New York, 134 U. S. 594, 606-607, the validity of such a
tax has not been questioned. This heavier burden the
State may impose by means of an annual franchise tax in
addition to the ordinary property and excise taxes imposed upon all persons, natural and artificial. Or it may
impose the heavier burden by means of a franchise tax
which will be the sole tax upon the corporation. That is,
it may make the franchise tax so high as to include both
the tax representing the special privilege of doing business
in corporate form and the equivalent for taxes borne by
natural persons engaged in the same occupation. Few
propositions are better settled than the rule that, in determining whether a state tax violates the Federal Constitution, we are to look at the operation or effect of the tax
and not at its name or form. Clark v. Titusvilte, 184

R. R. Co. v. Matthews,.174 U. S. 96, 103. Since a State
is permitted to impose upon the corporation more than a
pro rata share of the common burden of taxation, I find
nothing in the Federal Constitution which prohibits it
from adopting any of the familiar kinds of taxes as the
means of the heavier imposition. Surely, there is nothing
inherently objectionable in the long established, commonly used gross earnings tax, which should prevent its
being selected for that purpose.

"If we include the tax paid by individuals on the dividends received
from corporations, the rate of tax on net corporate income is 15.27
per cent, whereas had all the corporations been taxed as partnerships the average rate of tax on their net income would have been
9.1 per cent."

Why Pennsylvania should have chosen to impose upon
corporations a heavier tax than upon individuals or partnerships engaged under like circumstances in the same
line of business, or why it should have selected this partidular form of tax as the rheans of doing so, we have no
occasion to enquire. The State may have done this, because, in view of the advantages inherent in corporate
orgafiization, the Legislature believed that course necessary in order to insure a just distribution of the burdens
of government. In Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S.
107, 162, this Court listed the advantages which justify
the imposition of special taxes on corporations: "The
continuity of the business, without interruption by death
or dissolution, the transfer, of property interests by the
disposition of shares of stock, the advantages of business
controlled and managed by corporate directors, the general absence of individual liability, these and other things
inhere in the advantages of business thus conducted,
which donot exist when the same business is conducted
by private individuals or partnerships." 6
SThis reason for heavier taxation of corporations was stressed in
Congress both in the debate on the proposed amendment to the War
Revenue Bill of 1898 taxing corporations on their gross receipts, and
in the debate on the corporation tax amendment to the Tariff Bill of
1909. See 31 Cong. Rec. 4964, 5092, 5101; 44 Cong. Rec. 4237. Senator Root stated: "My own state has for many years grouped all
corporations within its borders, with certain specific exceptions, in a
class upon the revenues of which it imposes a tax imposed on no
other members of the community. And it is a late day for us to be
told that there is no right in the United States to adopt this old,
familiar, general basis of classification for the purpose of imposing an
excise tax. It is founded upon reason, sir, and not alone upon authority." 44 Cong. Rec. 4005-4006.

The states, too, have acted upon this theory. See Annual Report
of the Assessors of New York, 1882, pp. 15-17; Communication of
the Secretary of. State and the Attorney General of .Kansas, relating
to the bill for an annual franchise tax, 1911.

In Pennsylvania the practice of imposing heavier burdens upon corporations dates from a time when there, as
elsewhere in America, the fear of growing corporate power
was common. The present heavier imposition may be a
survival of an early effort to discourage the resort to that
form of organization. The apprehension is now less common. But there are still intelligent, informed, justminded and civilized persons who believe that the rapidly
growing aggregation of capital through corporations constitutes an insidious menace to the liberty of the citizen;
that it tends to increase the subjection of labor to capital;
that, because of the guidance and control necessarily exercised by great corporations upon .those engaged in business, individual initiative is being impaired and creative
power"will be lessened; that the absorption of capital by
corporations, and their perpetual life, may bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain; that the evils incident to the accelerating absorption of business by corporations outweigh the benefits thereby secured; and that
1920, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said: "I justify it on much
broader grounds. Companies incorporated with a limited liability
enjoy privileges and conveniences by virtue of the law for which they
may well be asked to pay some acknowledgment." The statement is
quoted in Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1920, p. 42.
7A commission appointed pursuant to joint resolution of the Legislature of Pennsylvania reported in 1862: "Corporations in this State
are very numerous and very powerful. They have not only drawn
within their control an immense amount of capital, but they have
drawn within their power the entire commerce of the State.
The franchises of corporations are property, and the legitimate sub.
ject of taxation; in fixing a tax upon corporations these extraordinary
privileges, their franchises, constitute the first grounds of the Commonwealth's claim to contribution, and in that consists her right to
discriminate in favor of the public." Shortly after this report the
Legislature passed the Act of April 30, 1864, P. L. 218, the first of
the special taxes on corporations which have since formed an integral
part of the revenue system of the State.

the process of absorption should be retarded. The Court
may think such views unsound. But, obviously, the requirement that a classification must be reasonable does
not imply that the policy embodied in the classification
made by the legislature of a State shall seem to this Court
a wise one. It is sufficient for us that there is nothing in
the Federal Constitution which p.:ohibits a State from imposing a heavier tax burden upon corporations organized
for the purpose of engaging exclusively in intrastate commerce; and that there is nothing inherently objectionable
in the instrument which Pennsylvania selected for imposing the heavier burden-the gross receipts tax.
For these reasons, I should have no doubt that the
statute of Pennsylvania was well within its power, if the
question were an open one. But it seems to me that the
validity of such legislation has been established by a
decision of this Court rendered after much consideration.
The contention here sustained differs in no essential respect from that made and overruled in Flint v. StoneTiacy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 161. There, as here, the tax.was
imposed merely because the owner of the business was a
corporation, as distinguished from an individual or a
partnership. There, as here, the character of the owner
was the sole fact on which the distinction was made to
depend. There, as here, the discrimination was not based
on any other difference in the source of the income or in
the character of the property employed. The cases differ
in but two respects, neither of them material. In the
Flint case the tax was on net income while here it is on
gross receipts; and the Flint case arose under the Fifth
Amendment while the present case arises under the Fourteenth. But a tax on net income is no more "peculiarly
applicable to corporations" than is a tax on gross receipts;
and in the Flint case it was distinctly ruled that "even
if the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment were ap-

plicable to the present case," the tax must be upheld.
More recently in Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, 251
U. S. 532, 534, the validity of a state statute discriminating against corporations was sustained, and it was said
that "a State may have a policy in taxation," and that
"a discrimination between corporations and individuals
with regard to a tax like this cannot be pronounced arbitrary, although we may not know the precise ground of
policy that led the State to insert the distinction in the
law." Compare Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S.
114, 126. In my opinion, the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania should be affirmed.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES concurs in this opinion.
MR. JusTIcE STONE, dissenting.
That businesses carried on in corporate form may be
taxed while those carried on by individuals or, partnerships are left untaxed, was the rule broadly applied under
the Fifth Amendment in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Company,
220 U. S. 107, and I can see no reason for not applying
it here under the Fourteenth Amendment as well. It is
no objection to a taxing statute that the classification is
based on two distinct elements-here the doing of business in a corporate form, upheld in Flint v. Stone-Tracy
Co., supra, (and see Home Insurance Co. v. New York,
134 U. S. 594; Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, 251
U. S. 532), and the character of the business done as distinguished from other classes of business, upheld in Southwestern Oil Co.v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114; Brown-Forman
Co. v. Kentucky, 217 U. S. 563; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245. For it was decided in Stebbins v.
Riley, 268 U. S. 137, that such a combination of two permissible bases of classification may itself be made the
basis of a classification.
