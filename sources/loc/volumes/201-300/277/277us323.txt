sary to affirm the judgment below, although we think the
rulings on which it was based erroneous. But the particular questions and portions of the record relied on, in
the light of the medical testimony, are not free from ambiguity. The point is not elaborated in the briefs of
either party and was not pressed upon us on the argument. At no time in the entire course of the litigation
does the effect of the answers appear to have received any
consideration independently of the supposed failure to
make sufficient disclosure to the company of knowledge
acquired by the insured after the application. Nor, in
the absence of the testimony as to the disclosure made to
Coblentz, are we able to say what its bearing may be on
the alleged misstatements in the application. Under such
circumstances we must decline to pass upon this defense.
Compare SoutheasternExpress Co. v. Robertson, 264 U. S.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 459. Argued April 16, 1928.-Decided May 21, 1928.
A schooner bound with cargo from New Orleans to Bordeaux developed leaks, because of unseaworthiness existing when she broke
ground, and was forced to take refuge in Havana for repairs.
Before the repairs were completed, an embargo was put into effect
by the United States. Prevented by this from continuing to Bordeaux, she proceeded to' New York and was there libeled by the
cargo-owners. The unseaworthiness was unknown to her owner or
master when the voyage began, but could have been discovered by
due diligence. Held:

1. That recovery was rightly limited to actual damage to the
cargo due to unseaworthiness, and to the difference between the
value of the cargo at Bordeaux had it arrived there on the contract
voyage and its value on arrival had the vessel proceeded there from
Havana when she was repaired and ready for sea. Pp. 330, 333.
2. Clauses in the bill of lading entitling the ship-owner to retain
the prepaid freight in case of forced interruption or abandonment
of the voyage, and exempting the vessel from liability for "restraint of princes," etc., were not displaced by the departure; so
that the freight and the damage due to the embargo were not recoverable by the cargo-owners. P. 333.
3. The rule that a voluntary deviation from the prescribed voyage displaces the contract of affreightment is not to be extended to
deviation to avoid perils of the sea, even in a case where the deviation would not have been necessary if the owner had used reasonable
diligence to start the voyage with a seaworthy vessel. P. 332.
4. In the absence of any showing that the embargo could reasonably have been foreseen by the ship-owner, or of special circumstances charging the ship-owner with the knowledge or expectation
that the unseaworthiness, or consequent delay, would bring the
vessel within its operation, the damage resulting from it to cargoowners is not attributable to the negligence of the ship-owner, but
to the embargo itself. P. 333.
5. The ship-owner having brought itself within the exception of
the bill of lading, the burden was on the cargo-owners to show that
the negligence was the cause of or contributed to the loss. P. 334.

Argument for Petitioners.

The law as to deviation is important in this case, because the schooner Malcolm Baxter, Jr., and her owner,
if guilty of a deviation would be unable to rely on any
clauses in the bill of lading or on any defense based on
impossibility or frustration, but would be responsible
to the cargo as an insurer for all the damages flowing
from her failure to arrive at destination. The Willdomino, 272 U. S. 718; St. Johns N. F. Shipping Corp'n

The line of cleavage between justifiable and unjustifiable deviation of an unseaworthy ship depends on

A "deviation" is an unjustifiable failure of a shipowner
to perform the-contracted voyage, and may arise not only
from a physical departure from the course of a voyage,
but also from other causes, such as unreasonable delay,
Kemsley, Millbourn & Co. v. United States 19 F. (2d) 441,
The Cittd di Messina, 169 Fed. 472; or from the failure
of a shipowner to furnish a vessel capable of performing.

In The Henry W. Cramp, 20 F. (2d) 320, the court
reached an exactly opposite conclusion from the decision
below in the case at bar.
The "Restraint of Princes" clause in the bill of lading
does not constitute a defense, because the shipowner's
negligence in knowingly sending the ship to sea in an
unseaworthy condition brought her within the operation
of the restraint invoked as a defense.
Exceptions in a bill of lading of a common carrier do
not exempt it from liability, if it appears that the damage, although prima facie due to an excepted cause, was
occasioned by the culpable negligenco of the carrier.

The rule that a shipowner may not defend under a bill
of lading exception of "restraint of princes" if the shipowner's own fault or negligence has in fact brought the
"restraint" into operation, is well illustrated by the case
of Dunn v. Donald Currie & Co., 8 Com. Cas. 33 (1902).

PartolaMfg. Co., 209 App. Div. 347, affirmed 239 N. Y.

The defense of impossibility of performance involves
historically and, indeed, necessarily an equitable doctrine, and it can properly be invoked only when it would
be unjust for the plaintiff to recover damages for the
defendant's failure to perform his contract. The failure
of plaintiff to perform an essential covenant or condition of his contract, precludes him from securing equitable relief, to which otherwise he might have been entitled.

The waiting at Havana after September 28, 1917, when
further performance became illegal, did not constitute a
deviation, because it was proper to wait a reasonable time
for the sailing vessel prohibition order to be lifted, and
because, even if the repairs had been completed earlier,
it was illegal after September 28, 1917, for the vessel to
continue the voyage. Illegality ended the contract on
September 28, 1917. Church v. Proctor, 66 Fed. 240;

The petitioners' second point with reference to a contract clause of restraint of princes conditioned on the exercise of due diligence and their third point with reference
to a defense of impossibility of performance or equitable
frustration, also conditioned on due diligence, are both
irrelevant because the defense here is illegality.

Opinion of the Court.

The leaks constituting unseaworthiness did not cause
the illegality. The contention is untenable that because
unseaworthiness may have caused the 9% sea-water damage which was found on arrival at New York after the
schooner had carried the cargo 2,000 miles, it was therefore the cause of the almost 100% loss of market and
steamer transshipment damages resulting from the ending of the contract at Havana because of illegality. St.

MR. JUSTICE StoNE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioners, in July, 1917, shipped a cargo on the
Schooner Malcolm Baxter, Jr., owned by respondent, from
New Orleans to Bordeaux, and prepaid the freight. The
bill of lading stipulated "prepaid freight is to be considered as earned on shipment of goods and is to be retained
by vessel's owner . . . if there be forced interruption or abandonment of the voyage, at a port of distress
or elsewhere." In addition there was the usual clause
exempting the vessel from " restraints of princes, rulers
and peoples."
After departure from New Orleans the Baxter developed leaks due to unseaworthiness which caused her
to put in at Key West, where she was surveyed. In
order to effect the necessary repairs she was towed to
Havana where she was unladen aid repaired, remaining
there for that purpose until January 14, 1918. Before
the completion of the repairs the United States Export
Administrative Board put into effect its ruling of Septem-

330

Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

ber 28, 1917, that sailing vessels would not be permitted
to clear for points beyond the war zone. This ruling remained in force when the repairs were completed, and
the Baxter, being unable to secure a clearance for Bordeaux, took her cargo on board and proceeded to New
York, where the petitioners libelled the vessel in the district court for southern New York to recover freight
money, damages to cargo and damages for failure to perform the contract voyage from New Orleans to Bordeaux.
Respondent as owner filed a petition for exolieration
and limitation of liability and enjoined further proceedings on the libels. Petitioners filed claims in the limitation proceedings, claiming damages as in the original
libels, setting up the deviation and the abandonment of
the voyage, by reason of the ship's unseaworthiness on
sailing.
The district court denied the petition to limit liability,
allowed the claim for freight money and for damages sustained by petitioners, including damage to cargo. A special master, appointed to take proof of damage, found
that the measure of damages was the excess cost of the
substituted carriage and incidental expenses, and in the
case of goods which could not be sent forward the damage
was measured by the difference between the value of the
goods at the time when and in the condition in which they
should have arrived at destination, and their value at the
place where and in the condition in which they actually
were received, less charges saved plus incidental expenses.
Final decree was given to the petitioners for the damage
as found.
The court of appeals for the second circuit upheld the
ruling of the district court denying exoneration and limitation of liability but reversed- the judgment, holding
there could be no recovery of the prepaid freight or excess
cost of transportation over prepaid freight; that the recovery of damages must be limited to actual damages to

Opinion of the Court.

cargo resulting from unseaworthiness, and the difference
between the value of the cargo had it arrived in Bordeaux
on a straight voyage on August 16, 1917, the date when
the Baxter sailed, and on a voyage leaving Havana January 14, 1918, the date when the repairs were completed and
the Baxter was ready for sea. The Malcolm Baxter, Jr.,
20 F. (2d) 304.
Both courts below agreed that the Baxter was unseaworthy on sailing and that respondent failed to exercise
due diligence to ascertain her condition before sailing.
This was sufficient ground for denying the petition for
exoneration and limitation of liability under the Harter
Act, Act of February 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445, and acts
permitting limitation of liability to the vessel and pending freight.
R. S. §§ 4282-4289. The correctness of
this determination is not raised on the petition here, Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific Paper Ass'n, 273 U. S.
52, 66, but petitioners urge that the Baxter's putting in
first at Key West and later at Havana must be deemed a
voluntary deviation because due to the negligence of the
owner in failing to discover the unseaworthiness and to
make the vessel seaworthy before sailing.
. Unseaworthiness alone or deviation caused by it displaces the contract of affreightment only in so far as damage is caused by the unseaworthiness. The Caledonia,157
U. S. 124; The Europa, [1908], P. 84. Thorleyv...Orchis
S. S. Co., Ltd., [1907], 1 K. B. 660; Kish v. Taylor,
[1912], A. C. 604, 618. But if the deviation here is to
be classed with voluntary deviations, respondent may not
claim the benefit of the clauses of the bill of lading and
is responsible for the cargo as insurer. The Willdomino,

The Indrapura,171 Fed. 929. In any case it is contended
that respondent's negligent failure to discover the unsea-

277 U. S.

worthiness of the vessel resulted in the delay which
brought her within the operation of the embargo, and that
the shipowners are for that reason liable for damages for
all the delay, including that immediately resulting from
the embargo.
Respondents had purchased the vessel about one month
before she sailed. At that time she was unseaworthy, due
to a 'hog' or camber in her keel, a structural weakness
dangerous to the ship in heavy weather, which later caused
the leak and made necessary the repairs at Havana. Following the purchase and before sailing from New Orleans
a survey was made by the owner, which appears not to
have disclosed her condition, but both courts below agree
that the fact of her unseaworthiness could have been discovered by due diligence.
The evidence supports the finding of the court of appeals that the master of the Baxter "did not leave New
Orleans with knowledge that he would have to make port
for repairs, and honestly thought he could make the trip
in safety and tried unsuccessfully to do so." The case
is therefore not one where the master set sail with the
knowledge that the deviation from the voyage, as described in the bill of lading, would ensue, and with the
purpose and intent to deviate as in The Willdomino, supra.
There the officers of the vessel, under direction of the
owner, sailed from Ponta Delgada, bound for New York,
all knowing that the supply of fuel was insufficient for
the voyage and intending to take the vessel to North
Sidney, and we held that the deviation under the circumstances was voluntary and inexcusable.
But here the deviation was not voluntary and the point
to be determined is whether a like effect is to be given
to a deviation to avoid perils of the sea, where the deviation would not have been necessary if the owner had used
reasonable diligence to start the voyage with a seaworthy
vessel.
No sufficient reason is suggested to us for thus extending
the rule, nor do we perceive any. Petitioners, without

THE MALCOLM BAXTER, JR.

'333

Opinion of the Court.

resort to it, are entitled to recover all damages caused by
the unseaworthiness. The basis of the privilege of deviation to avoid perils of the sea, is humanitarian. See
Carver, Carriage by Sea, (7th ed.) §§ 291, 292. To hold
that the master whose ship is in a perilous position must
choose between the hazard of continuing the voyage and
gaining safety only by forfeiting the contract of affreightment would be a departure from that principle for no
purpose except to give the shipper an added and unnecessary protection. "It is the presence of the peril
and not its cause" which justifies the deviation. See
Strang v. Scott, 14 App. Cas. 801. This is the conclusion
reached in other circuits. The Turret Crown, 297 Fed.
766; The Turret Crown, 284 Fed. 439, 445; The Turret
Crown, 282 Fed. 354, 360; see The Thessaloniki, 267 Fed.
67; and by the House of Lords in Kish v. Taylor, supra,
holding that a deviation caused by unseaworthiness due
to improper and negligent loading of the ship by the
master did not displace the bill of lading. This rule we
adopt as most consonant with -the reason and consequences
of the rule that a voluntary deviation displaces the contract of affreightment. It follows that the clauses of the
bill of lading remain effective and that petitioners may not
recover the freight money. Allanwilde Corp. v. Vacuum
Oil Co., 248 U. S.377.
But for all damages legally attributable to the breach
of warranty of seaworthiness petitioners may recover.
The Caledonia,supra. For the delay caused by the embargo alone petitioners may not recover, both because it
was within the exception of the bill of lading and because,
while it continued, performance of the c.ontract of affreightment would have been illegal. See Allanwilde Corp.
v. Vacuum Oil Co., supra, 385; Carver, Carriage by Sea,
(7th ed.), §§ 237, 238, 343, 344.
It was the embargo and not the unseaworthiness of the
vessel which delayed the voyage after the Baxter was repaired and ready for sea on January 14, 1918, and the unseaworthiness of the vessel did not cause the embargo.

334

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

But it is urged that it is enough to sustain the recovery
for the failure to complete the voyage that it was the
unseaworthiness, for which respondent was responsible,
that brought the vessel within the excepted peril.' This
view, although not without support, Green-Wheeler Shoe
Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island, & Pac. R. R., 130 Iowa 123;
Michaels v. New York Central R. R., 30 N. Y. 564; Condict v. Grand Trunk Ry., 54 N. Y. 500, does not generally
prevail. See 2 Williston, Contracts, § 1906, and cases cited.
It was rejected by this Court in Railroad Co. v. Reeves,
10 Wall. 176. There negligent delay in the transportation
of goods by the carrier brought them within the path of a
flood, which caused their destruction. The court held
that the flood and not the negligent delay was the proximate cause of the damage and that the rule causa proxima non remota spectatur applied to contracts of common carriers as to others. There has been no departure
from this rule and we see no reason for departing from it
now. See Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S.
469; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Calhoun, 213
U. S. 1; The Indrapura,supra; The Lusitania, 251 Fed.
715, 732; The Turret Crown, 282 Fed. 354, 360. There
is no finding, nor is it suggested, that at the time when
the contract of affreightment was entered into, or when
the vessel broke ground, the embargo could reasonably
have been foreseen, or that there were any special circumstances charging petitioners with the knowledge or
expectation that the unseaworthiness or consequent delay
would bring the vessel within its operation. The respondent having brought itself within the exception
under its bill of lading, the burden is on petitioners to
show that respondent's negligence was the cause of or
contributed to the loss. Railroad Company v. Reeves,
supra, 190; TransportationCo. v. Downer, 11 Wall. 129;
