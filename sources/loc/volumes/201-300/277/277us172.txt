of this power to a municipalty. Such provisions for insurance are not, even as applied to busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, an unreasonable burden on
that commerce, if limited to damages suffered within the

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE. DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

No. 612. Argued April 27, 1928.--Decided May 14, 1928.
1. The special remedy given by the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, for reviewing orders of the Interstate Commerce
Commission by suit against the United States, applies only to
orders dealing with subjects within the scope of the Commission's
duty to regulate commerce. P. 181.
2. This special remedy is inapplicable to a certificate issued by the
Commission to the Secretary of the Treasury under ยง 209, Transportation Act, 1920, stating the Commission's finding of the amount
required of the United States to make good to a railroad company
its guaranty of operating income during the six months following

the termination of Federal Control, and stating also the aggregate
amount theretofore certified, and thus showing (in this case) an
overpayment by the Government. P. 182.

APPF from a decree of the District Court dismissing,
for want of jurisdiction, a bill brought by the Railway
Company to annul two certificates issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Mr. F. G. Dorety, with whom Messrs. Thomas Balmer
and Fletcher Rockwood were on the brief, for appellant.
The Commission's certificate is an "order" within the
meaning of the Commerce Court and Urgent Deficiencies
Acts. I. C. C. v. Northern Pacific Ry Co., 216 U. S. 538;
I. C. C. v. D. L. & W. k. R. Co., 216 U. S. 531; Southern
Pacificv. I. C. C., 219 U. S. 433; United States v. Diffenbaugh, 222 U. S. 42; United States v. B. & O. R. R. Co.,

Ry., 265 U. S. 274; I. C. C. v. L. & N. R. R., 227 U. S. 88.
A few of the numerous cases in which the Court has
held that it had jurisdiction, but declined to give the
relief sought are Intermountain Rate Cases, 234 U. S.
476; Los Angeles Switching Case, 234 U. S. 234; United
States v. Pennsylvania R. R., 266 U. S. 191. A recent
case of this nature is C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. v. United States,
275 U. S. 404.
Cases in which injunction has been denied because of
lack of jurisdiction are cases in which the so-called order
of the Commission did not change the status or obligations of any individual or body, and was, therefore, held
to be not an order within the-meaning of the statute.

It is not necessary that the act complained of constitute
a command or a direction in order that the court may have
jurisdiction. Chicago Junction Case, 264 U. S.258; Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S. 153; Texas v. Eastern
Texas R. R. Co., 258 U. S. 204; Home Furniture Co. v.
United States, 271 U. S.456; Venner v. Michigan Central
R. R. Co., 271 U. S. 127.
The situation is very similar to that in Dayton-Goose
Creek Ry. v. United States, 263 U. S.456.
It is true that the cases where the court has declined
to take jurisdiction or has assumed jurisdiction under the
Urgent Deficiencies Act, are all cases arising under the
Interstate Commerce Act. These cases then throw no
light upon the question whether the order must be made
under the Interstate Commerce Act.
The right to enjoin unlawful acts or orders of administrative bodies or officials, has been recognized in 0. R. &
N. Co. v. Fairchild,224 U. S.510; N. P. Ry. v. Department of Public Works, 268 U. S.39. It is obvious therefore that the right to injunction applies in a proper case
to an unlawful order or act, either of the Commission or
of any other administrative body purporting to act under
any law whatever. The only question is whether the case
at bar is a proper case for injunction, and not whether
the order purports to be made under one Act or another.
Neither the Hepburn Act, nor the Commerce Court
Act, nor the Urgent Deficiencies Act, restricts the jurisdiction of the courts to orders made under the Interstate
Commerce Act. When Congress has conferred jurisdic-

tion on an inferior court in particular classes of cases, the
court has jurisdiction in cases of that class which arise
under statutes subsequently passed. In re Metzger, Fed.
Cas. No. 9511. Just as the courts have power to review
by injunction, orders of the Commission made under
amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act passed subsequent to the Urgent Deficiencies Act (Chicago Junction
Case, supra; Coloradov. United States, supra; Texas v.
Eastern Texas R. R. Co., supra; Venner v. Michigan Central R. R., supra), so has the court jurisdiction to review
by injunction, orders made by the Commission under any
other Acts giving powers to it.
Mr. Blackburn Esterline,Assistant to the Solicitor General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell was on the
brief, for the United States.
The amended certificate issued by the Commission to
the Secretary of the Treasury is not an "order." Procter
& Gamble v. United States, 225 U. S. 282; Lehigh Valley
R. R. v. United States, 243 U. S. 412; United States v.
Illinois Central R. R., 244 U. S. 82; Delaware& Hudson
*v. United States, 266 U. S. 438; New York etc. R. R. v.
United States, 273 U. S. 652; United States-v. Los Angeles
etc. R. R., 273 U. S. 299.
The amended certificate is niot even directed to the
Great Northern. Knowledge or notice of the certificate
comes to it through a demand made by the Secretary of
the Treasury. Even if the order is evidence in a suit
against the Great Northern, it would seem that it would
be time enough to assail its validity when the certificate
is brought forward in the suit. Suits may not be brought
before the specially constituted District Court under Urgent Deficiencies Act to suppress evidence or a cause of
action. Meeker v. Lehigh Valley, 236 U. S. 412; Mills v.
Lehigh Valley, 238 U. S. 473; Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S.

6 F. (2d) 646; United States v. Los Angeles etc. R. R.,
supra.
The transaction is between the Great Northern and
the United States exclusively. Consent that the United
States may be sued in such a transaction in the speciallyconstituted District Court is not found in the Urgeni
Deficiencies Act and does not exist. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373; Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 60;
Illinois Central R. R. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 245
U. S.493. The decree of the court would be no more than
merely advisory, as in Liberty Warehouse Co. v..Grannis,
273 U. S. 70; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126; Massachusetts v. Mellon,
262 U. S. 447; Texas v. I. C. C., 258 U. S. 158.
In a suit to set aside an order of the Commission under
Urgent Deficiencies Act, the United States is made by
statute a necessary party, and this means that it is to
stand in judgment as representing the public. Illinois
Central R. R. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 245 U. S. 493.
In this case, the United States is sued in a money transaction with which Great Northern alone is concerned.
Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, with whom Mr. P. J. Farrell
was on the brief, for the Interstate Commerce Commission.
That special jurisdiction, created as an amendment to
the Interstate Commerce Act, was intended solely for review of orders relating to commerce regulation directed to
carriers subject to the-regulatory authority, and was never
intended to afford review of a certificate directed, not to
the carriers subject to regulatory authority, but to the
Secretary of the Treasury, and relating, not to matters of
commerce regulation, but to a governmental guaranty
significantly excluded by the Act of its creation, Transportation Act, 1920, from those portions of that Act that were
named amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act.

Opinion of the Court.

Los Angeles Valuation Case, 273 U. S. 299; Procter &
Gamble v. United States, 225 U. S. 282.
While the Urgent Deficiencies Act authorizes suits in
name "against the Government in respect of matters of
commerce regulation, that authority cannot be consistently or harmoniously enlarged to embrace suits involving the public money, which are suits in substance as.
well as name, against the Government and, where authorized at all, are provided for before a special tribunal, or
by jurisdiction conferred upon the district courts limiting the monetary amount of'the, claim.
The court's jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies
Act to enjoin orders of the Commission bears a reciprocal
relationship to its jurisdiction to enforce such orders, and
the Commission's certificate, directed to the Secretary of
the Treasury rather than to the carriers, and being, moreover, for the payment of money, clearly falls outside the
enforcement side of the court's special jurisdiction over
regulatory orders and therefore should be reciprocally excluded from the enjoining side of the jurisdiction.
The-fact that the guaranty section is in substance a
gratuity, and the fact that its terms, agreed to by the carriers, clothe the Commission with broad discretion in the
premises without provision for appeal from its determination, rebut any possible implication that the Government
intended that the Urgent Deficiencies Act should constitute its consent to be sued in respect of the amount of
its gift.
The Government's consent to this suit cannot be found
in any other legislation providing for suits against the
United States in the district courts.
MR. JusTIcn BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the.

Stat. 539, as amended by Urgent Deficiencies Act of Octo-

ber 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, was brought by the
Great Northern Railway Company against the United
States, in the federal court for Minnesota, to annul two
certificates issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to ยง 209
of Transportation Act, 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91,
41 Stat. 456, 464-468, as amended by Act of February 26,
1921, c. 72, 41 Stat. 1145. The Company claims that these
certificates are orders of the Commission; that they were
issued without authority of law; and that they are void.
The United States and the Commission moved to dismiss
on the ground that the certificates sought to be annulled
are not orders of the Commission within the meaning of
the Commerce Court and Urgent Deficiencies Acts; and
that the United States had not consented to be sued. The
case was heard before three judges who dismissed the bill
for want of jurisdiction. 22 F. (2d) 865.. Whether they
erred in so doing is the only question: presented by the
appeal.
Certificates under ยง 209 are an incident of the termination of the federal control of the railroads on March 1,
1920. They.are provided for in Title II of Transportation
Act, 1920. By ยง 209(c) of that Act, the United States
guaranteed to each company that its railway operating
income for the following six months should be .not less
than one-half of the amount of the annual compensation to which it was entitled during the period of federal
control. Paragraph (g) provided that: "The Commission shall, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
guaranty period, ascertain and certify to the Secretary
of the Treasury the several amounts necessary to make
good the foregoing guaranty .......
.Paragraph
(h)
provided for the issue, during the guaranty period, of certificates for payment on account, if the carrier furnishes
an adequately secured contract to repay to the United

GT. NORTHERN RY. v. UNITED STATES. 179

Opinion of the Court.

States any amount received in excess of that which shall
be finally determined as the sum to which the carrier is
entitled under the guaranty. Section 212, added by the
Act of February 26, 1921, c. 72, 41 Stat. 1145, provided
for payments on account after the expiration of the guaranty period, the Commission being authorized to "make
its certificate for any -amount definitely ascertained by
it to be due, and . . . thereafter in the same manner
make further certificates, until the whole amount due has
been certified." Upon receipt of certificates the Secretary
of the Treasury was directed "to draw warrants in favor
of each such carrier upon the Treasury of the United
States, for the amount shown in such certificate as necessary to make good such guaranty." "
Upon certificates of the Commission issued to the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (h), he paid the
Company $6,500,000 in 1920. Upon certificate issued
under ยง 212, he paid it $6,000,000 in 1921. Several years
later, in the course of the proceedings for final settlement
of the amount due the Company under ยง 209, the Commission issued to the Secretary of the Treasury the two
certificates here in suit. Only the second of them is of
importance. It certified that the total amount required
to make good to the Company the guaranty provided for
in ยง 209 was $11,170,214.02. Guaranty Settlement with
Great Northern Railway Co. et al., 99 I. C. C. 231; 111
I. C. C. 318. As the Secretary of the Treasury had paid
$12,500,000 to the Company, he demanded reimbursement,
as an overpayment, of $1,329,785.98, being the difference
between the aggregate amounts received by the Company
and the total amount certified as payable under the guaranty. Pending settlement of that claim, the Government
withheld payment to the Company of all amounts accruing for transportation services, but the payments were
resumed upon the Company's deposit'of Liberty bonds as

collateral. Thereupon, this suit was brought by the Company to annul the certificates and to restrain the Government from enforcing its claim by sale of the Liberty bonds
or otherwise.
The function imposed upon the Commission by ยง 209
is solely that of determining the amount required to make
good the Government's guaranty. It is not an exertion of
the delegated power to regulate interstate commerce. It
is an incident of the World War-a temporary, non-recurrent task, which might appropriately have been performed for the Treasury by its Comptroller or auditors,
or by other trusted official. Congress selected the Commission for this service, doubtless, because of its special
fitness. For the Commission had knowledge of railroads
and experience in railroad accounting; it had the custody
of the records of railroad operations; and its staff was competent to make speedily the necessary investigations.
Transportation Act, 1920, did not confer upon the
Commission power to order anything in connection with
the issue of the certificates. There is in the certificates
no direction, no word of command. They are the recital
of a finding of fact. They are addressed to the Secretary
of the Treasury; and only to him. The form of the certificate expresses appropriately the character of the service
performed by the Commission. The final certificate does
not purport to declare that the carrier is indebted to the
United States in any sum. It states the total amount
required of the United States to make good the guaranty
and the aggregate amount theretofore certified. It discloses the facts, but does not certify that there was an
overpayment.1 Congress distinguished clearly, in framIThe certificate reads (111 I. C. C. 318, 338-339):
"To THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES: . . .

Secretary of the Treasury, that the amount necessary to make good

ing Transportation Act, 1920, between provisions which
,were amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act and
those which, while relating to-railroads, were not. The
amendments were grouped under' Title IV. The provisions here involved, which related solely to the termination, of federal control, were grouped under Title II.
Those which provided for the Railroad Labor Board, under Title III. Because issuing certificates is not a part of
the Commission's delegated power to regulate commerce
and is not an incident of such regulation, the special remedy provided by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is not available to review the legality or correctness of its action in
doing so.
The Company points out that the action of the Commission here in question was affirmative, not negative, as
in Procter& Gamble Co. v. United States, 225 U. S. 282;
that it relates to a matter of substance'and not merely to
a step in procedure, as in'United States v. Illinois Central
R. R. Co., 244 U. S. 82; that it determines legal rights and
to said Great Northern Railway Company the guaranty provided by
section 209 of the transportation act, 1920, is $11,170,214.02;..
"3. The commission has heretofore certified to the Secretary of
the Treasury as advances under section 209(h) to said Great Northern Railway Company an aggregate amount of $6,500,000, as follows:
Certificate No. 65, June 25, 1920 .............. $3,000,000
Certificate No. 225, August 31, 1920. ......... 2,000,000
Certificate No. 276, November 4, 1920 ......... 1,500,000
and as partial payment to said Great Northern Railway Company
under section 209(g), as amended by section 212, an amount of
$6,000,000 on March 1, 1921, under certificate No. A-329. o
"4. The commission has made final determination as aforesaid of
the amount of the guaranty provided for by section 209 of the transportation act, 1920.
"Dated this 8th day of June, 1926."
The two certificates here involved deal with the same subject matter. The issue of the second canceled the earlier one, which differed
as to the amount due to the Company and which had contained a
certification of the fact of overpayment. 99 I. C. C. 231, 234, 25.

obligations, and is not simply the tentative or final report
of an investigation, as were the orders which we declined
to review in Delaware& Hudson Co. v. United States, 266
U. S. 438, and United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake
R. R. Co., 273 U. S. 299; and that its being entitled as a
certificate rather than as an order is not fatal to the equity
jurisdiction of the District Court under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Compare Chicago Junction Case, 264 U. S.
258, 263; Coloradov. United States, 271 U. S. 153; Home
FurnitureCo. v. United States, 271 U. S. 456. But these
considerations are irrelevant. For the inapplicability of
the special remedy given by the Urgent Deficiencies Act
is due to the fact that the certificate deals with a subject
matter not within .the scope of the Commission's duty to
regulate commerce, and hence, not within the purview of
that remedy. In this respect, among others, it differs
from the order involved in Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co.
v. United States, 263 U. S. 456.
It is said that, unless this remedy is available, the Company may be without redress. The argument is that the
determination by the Commission of the amount required
to make good the guaranty, may be likened to an award
of arbitrators; that the ground of the attack upon the
certificates is that they were made under a mistake of law;
and that an award can be set aside for mistake of law only
in equity, HartfordFireInsuranceCo. v. Bonner Mercantile Co., 44 Fed. 151; McLaurin v. MeLauchlin, 215 Fed.
345. We have no occasion to enquire whether a remedy
at law or some other remedy in equity is available. The
mere fact that the certificate may be conclusive, if it be a
fact, would not entitle the Company to a judicial review.
Compare United States v. Babcock, 250 U. S. 328, 331;
Work v. Rives, 267 U. S. 175. We find no reason for
thinking that because Congress confided to the Commission the task of certifying the amount to be paid to carriers from the public treasury, as an incident to the World
