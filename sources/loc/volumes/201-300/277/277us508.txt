the plaintiffs upon their giving a good and sufficient bond
or undertaking to pay such damages within a limited time
after the same are ascertained.
The evidence appears not to have been taken with a
dew to an ascertainment of the damages, but there is
cestimony tending to show that the owner of the surface
is asserting a claim for damages done at the time the plaintiffs entered or soon thereafter. It of course is admissible
to fix the damages by agreement. But if this be not done
there will be need for a hearing on that question.
We conclude that the decree of the circuit court of ap-

peals should be reversed and that the cause should be
remanded to the district court with directions to modify
its decree in accordance with what is said in this opinion.

NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY v.
UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 228. Argued April 12, 1928.-Decided June 4, 1928.
The Revenue Act of 1921 provides that the gross income of a life
insurance company shall be the gross amount of income received
during the taxable year from interest, dividends, and rents, and
that the net income upon which its income tax is to be assessed
shall be the gross income less specified deductions, among which are
(1) the amount of interest received during the taxable year from
tax-exempt securities, and (2) an amount equal to 4% of the company's mean reserve funds, diminished, however, by the amount of
the first deduction, the interest from tax-exempt securities. In the
case at bar, the petitioner company, though allowed the first deduction, comprising the interest from its exempt state, municipal and
United States bonds, was not advantaged thereby; for, since the
same amount was subtracted in computing the second deduction,

its tax was the same as -if
all of its securities had been taxable, and
higher than it would have been if those that were tax-free had not
belonged to it. The Act (§ 213) expressly disavows any purpose to
tax interest upon obligations of the United States, and provides
(§ 1403) that if any of its provisions or the application thereof to
any persons of circumstances be held invalid, the remainder of the
Act, and the application of such provisions to 'other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. Held:
1. The effect of the statutory computation, of deductions was to impose a direct tax on the income of the exempt securities, amounting
to taxation of the securities themselves. Pp. 519, 521.
2. The tax, insofar as it affects state and municipal bonds, was unconstitutional. P. 521.
3. The tax, insofar as it affects the United States bonds, was contrary
to the manifest general purpose of the statute, which (§ 213) expressly disavowed any purpose to tax interest on such obligations
rand did not intend to subject them to burdens which could not be
'imposed on state obligations. P. 521.
4. Considering this, and the saving clause, abatement -of-the 4% deduction by the amount of interest received from tax-exempt securities cannot be given effect against the petitioner, under -the circumstances disclosed; and petitioner is entitled to recover taxes paid.

of Claims dismissing a claim for taxes alleged to have
been illegally collected.
Messrs. Win. Marshall Bullitt and J. Harry Covington,
with whom Mr. George b. Young was on the brief,for
petitioner.
The effect of the statute is to include all tax-exempt
income in the "net income" on which the 10% tax is
levied. [This was demonstrated by interesting algebraic
methods.] Although the National Life derived nearly
one-third of its entire gross income from tax-exempt securities, yet it had to pay exactly the same tax as it would
have paid Iffts whole income were from taxable securities. As aptly said by Justice McReynolds in Nichols V-

277 U. S.

Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 541, "Taxes are very real things
and statutes imposing them are estimated by practical
results."
The effect of the Act was to accomplish a purpose not
to give the taxpayer any exemption on his tax-exempt
bonds, by the simple expedient of first allowing the exemption, and then providing that any taxpayer, having
such exemption, should have his authorized deductions
ipso facto reduced by the exact amount of his tax-exemptions.
Of two companies, identic in size of assets, income and
business, A, with a million dollars tax-exempt income,
pays exactly the same tax as B, with no tax-exempt income; and so the practical'effect of the Act ii to tax A's
tax-exempt income. While, with the same income subject to taxation, A pays vastly more than B solely because A has invested in U. S. bonds.
Or, stated from a slightly different angle, while B, having no tax-exempt securities, is allowed to deduct 4% of
its reserve, A, solely because it owns tax-exempt securities,
is allowed a deduction diminished in the precise amount
of its tax-exempt income; so that A, solely because it
owns tax-exempt securities, is taxed upon its other taxable income a greater tax than B, who does not own any
tax-free bonds. The sole basis of classification between
A and B, is A's ownership of tax-exempt securities; and
that differentiation is made the basis of giving B a correspondingly greater reduction.
Section 245 (a) (2) is unconstitutional in so far as it
reduces the 4% of Reserves exemption by the exact
amount of the National Life's tax-exempt income; and
this is so because its purpose and effect are to tax the
income from tax-exempt bonds. Congress cannot tax
(1) instrumentalities of the States, nor (2) the income
from U. S. bonds which it has expressly exempted from
taxation. The effect of § 245 (a) (2) is to tax the income

from tax-free securities. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins.
Co. v. Wisconsin; 275 U. S. 136; Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S.
245; Farmers Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U.-S. 516; Miller
v. Milwaukee, 272 U. S. 713.
A chronological -review of authorities condemns the
plan embraced in § 245 (a) (2). United States v. Ritchie,
Fed. Cas. 16,168; People v. Commissioners, 41 How. Pr.
459; People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 539; Farmers Bank v.
Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516; Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245;
Miles v. Graham,268 U. S. 501.

Although Evans v. Gore and Miles v. Graham, supra,
are not as directly in point as others. of the cases reviewed,
they are important as establishing the doctrine that if
income (whether judicial salary or interest from tax-free
bonds) is exempt from diminution or seizure by governmental authority, it cannot be diminished or taken by the
device of compelling its-inclusion .in " gross" income as
the basis from which "net" income is ascertained. The
exempted income must be, for purposes of taxation,
treated as non-existent.
In the case at bar, the National Life insists that its
interest from- the state, and federal bonds should be
treated, for tax purposes, as being as completely nonexistent as Evans v. Gore and Miles v. Graham held that
a judicial salary should be treated as non-existent when
it came to tax purposes.,
Three cases are directly in point, viz., City of Waco v.
Amicable Life Ins. Co. (Tex.), 230 S. W. 698; id.,, 248
S. W. 332; Motor Car Co. v2 Detroit, 232 Mich. 245; and
Miller v. Milwaukee, 272 U. S. 713.
If the device of § 245 (a) (2) be sustained, then the
door will be open wide for the States, by simple statutory
amendments, to nullify many of this Court's most important rulings as to tax-exempt property, for example,

275 U. S. 136.
The power of Congress to grant or refuse deductions
does not authorize "unconstitutional conditions" of deduction. Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374;
Miller v. Milwaukee, 272 U. S. 713; Nichols v. "Coolidge,
274 U. S. 531.
Congress had the absolute power to grant, or to refuse
to grant, deductions in the shape of a percentage of the
Reserves. It could have made such deduction, if allowed
at all, 1%, 2%, 3%, or any other per cent that, in its discretion, the equitable and economic necessities of the case
required. But, it could not lawfully authorize a conditional deduction (1) where the full deduction was allowed, if a company held no tax-free securities; whereas
(2) if a company held tax-free securities, the deduction
was made smaller, in the exact amount of such tax-free
securities,-so that the effect was to impose a tax upon
tax-free securities, in the precise amount that. they would
have been taxed if a tax had been levied upon them eo
nomine.

The whole point is that the ownership of tax-exempt
securities, cannot be made the basis of a classification,
whose sole purpose is to tax more heavily those who hold
tax-exempt securities, than those who do not hold them.
The Government can tax anything it pleases, except
tax-exempts; but it must deduct tax-exempts from anything on which it imposes taxes. It can give any further
deductions that it pleases, and it can ascertain what that
deduction shall be in almost any way it pleases.
It can make that deduction equivalent to. the man's
debts, or to his tangible property, or to his bank stocks,
or to his agricultural products, or to any fraction of any
of those, but the qualification is, that it cannot make the

ownership of tax-exempts in Aiiy way a factor in determining the amount of the'deduction. In other words, it
cannot use the ownership of tax-exempts in -any,
way so
that such ownership shall work out adversely to any citizen owning such tax-exerhpt securities.- This is'an implied and necessary limitatioi on the'power to give a
deduction that would btherwise be wholly -'within the
discretion of the Iegislature.
The State, in making any deduction-or in granting any
privilege; cannot make the -ownership of tax-exempt securities result, in the taxpayer getting.. a less benefit or
privilege than he would have had if -he had not -owned
them, because the minute you do that, you are putting a
burden on the ownership,,of the. ax-exempt securities.
It, cannot annex, to the prvilege of a. deduction the surrender or subtraction of the constitutional privilege of
tax exemption. Terrall y. Burke, 257 U. S.-529.
The Act purports to-be something that it is not. While
it is true the- Government could tax the gross income,
minus .the tax-exempt, income, yet it ,cannot tax gross
income, minus 4% of Reserves, without giving the benefit:
of tax-exempt income. It s absurd to subtract the taxexempt income and then add it back on. Regard must
be had to the substance of what is done and not merely

to the form. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S.531; Child

therefrom cannot be taxed; and that inquiry will be
permitted into the income taxed, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it comes from a source which is itself
untaxable.
The tax is an income tax and not an excise tax. Distinguishing Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107;
Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U. S. 103; Stratton's
Independence v. Howbert, 231 U. S. 399; and Brushaber
v. Union Pacific, 240 U. S. 1.
Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell was on
the brief, for the United States.
Petitioner hAs not 'been taxed upon any part of its
income from tax-exempt securities, and the law does not
impose any tax thereon. If the gross income of a life
insurance company consisted wholly of interest from such
securities, it would all be deducted, no matter how much
it might be. The exemption is absolute and unqualified.
The misconception underlying the petitioner's argument
is that for some unexplained reason a life insurance company is entitled as of right to a further deduction of' 4%
of its legal reserve without reference to the amount of
that reserve or of the securities in which it is invesied.
Conceding that Congress has no power to tax income
from state and municipal bonds, and has power to tax income from rents, stock dividends, railroad bonds, and
mortgages, it is obvious that it could exempt income
from any one or all of these forms of investment without
thereby infringing upon the immunity of the state and
municipal bonds from taxation. The immunity of one
class of security from taxation does not impose upon Congress an obligation to tax all other forms of investment.
Neither the Bill upon its face nor what was said of it
by the committees having it in charge justifies the accusation that Congress was attempting by subterfuge to

override its constitutional limitations or to impose an
unrighteous system of taxation upon these companies.
No complaint may fairly be made because the statute
does not permit petitioner to deduct the same income
twice. The single fact of importance is that the taxexempt income of, the companies is given complete exemption from taxation under any and all circumstances.
Petitioner had no inherent right to the deduction of
any amount based upon its reserves. 'Deductions are a
matter of legislative discretion and authority for all deductions must be found in the statute. New Creek Co.
v. Lederer, 295 Fed. 433; People ex rel. Bijur v. Barker,
155 N. Y. 330; Smalley v. Burlington, 63 Vt. 443.
Upon constitutional grounds no complaint could have
been. made by any company had Congress omitted entirely the deductions specified in § 245 (a) (2). The fact
that an insurance company holding no tax-exempt securities will under- certain circumstances pay no greater
tax than will another company having tax-exempt securities, is not discriminatory in, a legal sense. Cf.
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1. It is
not discrimination against tax-exempt securities to give
exemption to other securities which could lawfully be
taxed, and no corporation holding securities which may
not constitutionally be taxed has a right to insist that
its neighbor, owning securities which are within the taxing power, shall, be taxed. The uniformity required by
Art. I, § 8, cl. 1 of the Constitution, means geographical
uniformity. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41; Patton v.
Brady, 184 U., S. 608; 1arclay & Co. v. Edwards, 267
U. S. 442.
Congress has authority to adjust its income taxes according to its discretion within the bounds of geographical uniformity. The Revenue Act of 1921 treats all
insurance corporations .alike, and if -in its application a

tax in particular instances may seem to bear upon one
corporation more than another, this is due to differences
in their circumstances, not to lack of uniformity in the
tax imposed. LaBelle Iron, Works v. United States, 256
U. S. 377.
No company under this statute can possibly be taxed
by reason of its ownership of tax-exempt securities more
heavily than those which do not hold them, other things
being equal, and "tax-exempt securities" are under all
conditions deducted from that upon which the taxes are
imposed.
Mr. Charles Evans Hughes on behalf of The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, The Mutual Benefit
Life Insurance 'Company, and The Prudential Insurance
Company, as amici curiae, filed a brief by special leave of
court, sustaining the legislation in question.
MR. JUSTICE McRYN0LDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
In 1921, departing from previous plans, Congress laid
a tax on life insurance companies based upon the sum of
all interests and dividends and rents received, less certain
specified deductions-(1) interest derived from tax
exempt securities, if any; (2) a sum equal to four per
centum of the company's legal reserve diminished by
the amount of the interest described in paragraph (1);
(3) other miscellaneous items-seven-not presently
important.
Petitioner maintains that, acting under this plan, the
Collector illegally required it to pay taxes, for the year
1921, on federal, state and municipal bonds; and it seeks
to recover the amount so exacted. The Court of Claims
gave judgment for the United States.

The mean of petitioner's reserve funds for 1921 was

During 1921 interest derived from all sources amounted
to $3,811,132.78; from dividends, nothing; . from rents,
$13,460.00. Total, $3,824,592.78. $1,125,788.26 of this
interest came from tax exempt securities-873,075.66
from state and municipal obligations, and $252,712.60
from those of the United States.
The Collector treated interest plus dividends plus rents,
$3,824,592.78, as gross income, and allowed deductions
amounting to $2,899,690.79, made up of the following
items: $1,125,788.26, interest from tax exempt securities;
$1,569,490.86, the difference between 4% of the reserve
fund ($2,695,279.12) and ($1,125,788.26) interest received
from exempt securities; miscellaneous items,not contested

and negligible here, $204,411.67. After deducting these
from total receipts ($3,824,592.78-$2,899,690.79), there
remained a balance of $924,901.99. This he regarded as
net income and upon it exacted ten per centum, $92,490.20.
If all interest received by the Company had come from
taxable securities, then, following the statute, there would
have been deducted from the gross of $3,824,592.78-4%
of the reserve, $2,695,279.12, plus the miscellaneous items
$204,411.67-$2,899,690.79, and upon the balance of
$924,901.99 the tax would have been $92,490.20. Thus it
becomes apparent that petitioner was accorded no advantage by reason of ownership of tax exempt securities.
Petitioner mnaintains that the result of the Collector's
action was unlawfully to discriminate against it and really
to exact payment on account of its exempt securities, contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States.
Also that diminution of the ordinary deduction of 4% of
the reserves because of interest received from tax exempt
securities, ip effect, defeated the exemption guaranteed to
their owners.
The portion of petitioner's income from the three specified-sources kvhich Congress had power to tax--its taxable
income-was the sum of these items less the interest derived from tax exempt securities. Because of the receipt
of interest from such securities, and to its full extent, pursuing the plan of the statute, the Collector diminished the
4% deduction allowable to those holding no such securities. Thus, he required petitioner to pay more upon its
taxable income than could have been demanded had.this
been derived solely from taxable securities. If permitted,
this would, destroy the guaranteed exemption. One may
not be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property solely because he owns some that is free. No device
or form of words can deprive him of the exemption for
which he has lawfully contracted.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

The suggestion that as Congress may or may not grant
deductions from gross income at pleasure, it can deny to
one and give to another is specious, but unsound. The
burden from which federal and state obligations are free
is the one laid upon other property. To determine what
this burden is requires consideration of the mode of assessment, including, of course, deductions from gross values.
What remains after subtracting all allowances is the thing
really taxed.
United States v. Ritchie (1872) Fed. Cases 16,168.
Ritchie was the state's attorney for Frederick County,
Md. The federal statute allowed an exemption of $1,000.
The collector claimed that if Ritchie's salary was held
free from taxation, one thousand dollars of it should be
applied to the exemption clause. Giles, J., held: "The
United States could not apply the compensation of a state
officer to the satisfaction of the exemption alone, because
that would, indirectly, make his income from such source
liable to the taxation from which it is exempt; that to
exhaust the exemption clause by taking the amount out
of his official income, would be to-make it, in effect, subject to the revenue law, and to deny to a state's officer
the advantage of the state's exemption, and that therefore
the official income of defendant was not to be taken into
consideration in the assessment of the tax."
People, etc. v. Commissioners (1870) 41 How. Prac.
Reports, 459.
Held:-That in determining the amount of personal
property of an individual, by assessors or commissioners
of taxes, for the purpose of taxation, stocks and bonds of
the United States are to form no part of the estimate.
They cannot be excluded or deducted from the amount of
his assets, liable to taxation, for it is error to include them
in such assets.

-521

Opinion of the Court.

Held:-That tax exempt credifs may not be taxed,
directly or indirectly, and in levying a tax on property
they must be treated as nonexistent. The provision ,of
Act No. 297, Pub. Acts 1921, providing that if the person to
be taxed "shall be the owner of credits that are exempt
from taxation such proportion only of his indebtedness
shall be deducted from debts due or to become due as
is represented by the ratio between taxable credits and
total credits owned, whether taxable or not," is void as
an interference with the power of the United States Government to raise money by issuance .of tax exempt obligations and is in conflict with the Constitution of the
United States.
See also City of Waco v. Amicable Life Ins. Co. (Tex.)
230 S. W. 698.;:id., 248 S. W. 332.
Miller, et al., Executors v. Milwaukee, 272 U. S. 713.
Held:-That where income- from bonds of the United
States which by Act of Congress is exempt from state
taxation is reached purpdsely, in the case of corporationowned bonds, by exempting the income therefrom in the
hands of the corporations,. and taxing- only so much of
the stockholder's dividends as corresponds to the corporate income not assessed, the tax is invalid.
It is settled doctrine that directly to tax the income
from securities amounts to taxation of the securities
themselves, Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin,, 275 U. S. 136. Also that the United States
may not tax state or municipal bbligations. 'Metcalf &
Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S: 514, 521.
How far the United States night repudiate their agreement not to tax we need not stop to consider. Counsel
do not claim that here state obligations -should have
more favorable treatment than'.is accorded to those of
the Federal Government. The Revenue Act of 1921 (Sec.
213) expressly disavows any purpose to tax interest upon
the latter's obligations.

BRANDEIS, J., dissenting.

277 U. S.

Section 1403 provides"That if any provision of this Act, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid,
the remainder of the Act, and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall not
be affected thereby."
Congress had no power purposely and directly to tax
state obligations by refusing to their owners deductions
allowed to others. It had no purpose to subject obligations of the United States to burdens which could not
be imposed upon those of a State.
Considering what has been said, together with the
saving clause just quoted, and the manifest general purpose of the statute, we think that provision of the Act
which undertook to abate the 4% deduction by the
amount of interest received from tax exempt securities
cannot be given effect as against petitioner under the
circumstances here disclosed. It was unlawfully required
to pay $92,490.20 and is entitled to recover.
The judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed.
If within ten days counsel can agree upon a decree for
entry here, it may be presented. Otherwise, the cause
will be remanded to the Court of Claims for further
proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

Ever since Corporation Tax Act, August 5, 1909, c. 6,
§ 38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, the United States has laid upon life
insurance companies a special excise tax measured by, net
income. But the several revenue acts have varied as to
the rate of the tax and also as to the method of computing
the taxable income. That is, the items to be included in
gross income and the items to be allowed as deductions
have been changed from time to time. In the earliest act
no deduction was made of interest on tax-exempt bonds.
Until 1921, the gross.income considered included premium

Co. v. Lederer, 252 U. S. 523. The inclusion of premium
receipts, with corresponding deductions, wds found to be
unsatisfactory. After much consideration, Congress, upon
consultation with the life insurance companies and with
the approval of at least most of them, substituted a new
basis for computing the tax.2 Act of November 23, 1921,

Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, § 38, 36 Stat. 11, 112; Act of October

amount required by law to be added to their reserves.

In a memorandum filed with the Committee on Ways and Means
of the House of Representatives at the time when the Revenue Bill
of 1918 was being considered, the Association of Life Insurance Presidents stated: "Although only a minor proportion of the premiums
received by the insurance companies constitutes true income, the
greater part being the policyholders' contributions toward current
losses and to permanent capital, the entire premium income is included in gross income under the income-tax law. This departure
from principle is, however, rendered innocuous through deductions
expressly allowed by the statute." Hearings before the Committee on
Ways and Means, House of Representatives, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.,
on the Proposed Revenue Act of 1918, Pt. I, p. 811. The Senate
Finance Committee recommended in 1918 the plan later included in
the Act of 1921, namely, that the basis of the tax be changed so as to
include only the investment income, and that the deductions should
be similarly limited. Senate Report, 65th Cong., 3rd Sess., No. 617,
p. 9. In presenting the bill Senator Simmons stated that it had been
framed after consultation with many representatives of the life insurance companies. 57 Cong. Rec. 254. The plan was adopted by the
Senate, but had to be abandoned in conference.
At the Annual Meeting of Life Insurance Presidents, December,
1920, it was stated that the basis of the income tax was unsatisfactory both to the companies and to the Government, and that a plan
similar to that embodied in the Senate amendment to the 1918 bill
should be adopted. Proceedings of the-'14th Annual Meeting, pp.

c. 136, §§ 243-245, 42"Stat. 227, 261. The validity of
that Act is now attacked by the National Life Insurance
Company. Other companies have, as amici curiae, filed

a brief in, support of the legislation.
The gross income to be considered under the Act of 1921
is limited to that received "from interest, dividends, and
rents." In order to ascertain the taxable income, this gross
investment income is to be reduced by nine classes of
deductions, so far as severally applicable. Only two of
these are material here-the provisions in paragraphs (1)
and (2) of § 245. Taken together, they provide for the
deduction from the gross investment income of the interest from tax-exempt bonds or of an amount equal to
4 per cent of the mean insurance reserve, whichever sum
is the greater. That is, paragraph (1) provides for a deduction of interest received from tax-exempt bonds; '
140-141, 143-145. The Revenue Bill of 1921, as introduced in the
House, contained the plan of taxation which had been aaopted by the
Senate in 1918. House Report, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., No. 350, p. 14.
It was stated to the Senate Finance Committee that "all the life
insurance companies are behind that scheme and are satisfied with it."

Sess., on H. R. 8245, September 1-Octoller 1, 1921, p. 84. See also

Curiae, p. 1.

The scope of the deduction to be made on account of tax-exempt
securities is defined by paragraph 4 of subdivision (b) of § 213 of the
Act: "Interest upon (a) the obligations of a State, Territory, or any
political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia; or (b) securities issued under the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act of
July 17, 1916; or (c) the obligations of the United States or its possessions; or (d) bonds issued by the War Finance Corporation. In
the case of obligations of the United States issued after September 1,
1917 (other than postal savings certificates of deposit) and in the
case of bonds issued by the War Finance Corporation, the interest
shall be exempt only if and to the-extent provided in the respective
Acts authorizing the issue thereof as amended and supplemented, and
shall be excluded from gross income only if and to the extent it is
wholly exempt to the taxpayer from income, war-profits and excessprofits taxes." 42 Stat. 227, 238.

and this deduction is to be made to the full extent, under
all circumstances. Paragraph (2) provides that there shal
be deducted such amount, if any, as is required to be added
to the inc6me from the tax-exempt securities, to equal 4
per cent of the mean insurance reserve. Thus, no deduction under paragraph (2) will be allowed, if the income
from the tax-exempt securities equals or exceeds 4 per
cent of the required reserve. And if the Company has any
income from tax-exempt bonds, it will not receive the full
deduction of 4per cent of the required reserve, under paragraph (2). The reason for allowing the deduction of 4
per cent of the reserve is that a portion of the "interest,
dividends, and rents" received have to be used each year
in maintaining the reserve, i. e.,. adding to it on the basis
of a certain interest rate, varying from 3 per cent to 4
per cent according to the requirements of the statutes of
the several States.The National Life Insurance Company had, during the
year 1921, gross investment ifncome amounting to 83,824,592.78. Of this income, $1,125,788.26 was interest on
tax-exempt bonds. Four per cent of the Company's insurance reserve amounted to $2,695,279.12. As the interest received from tax-exempt'bonds was less than 4 per
cent upon its reserve, the Company was allowed under
paragraph (2) the additional deduction of a sum equal
to the difference between these two, namely $1,569,490.86.
The aggregate of the deductions allowed under paragraphs
(1) and (2) was thus no greater than the deduction
would have been if all the Company's income had been
derived from taxable securities.
That the return and the payment required of the Com - .
pany-was in exact accord with the Act is conceded. The
contention is that the Act is unconstitutional, because as
applied it renders, the tax-exempt privilege of no value to
the Company. The argument is that the tax .burden
from which such federal and state obligations are free is

the one laid upon other property; that a person may not
be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property
because he owns some that is free; that here the Company has been required to pay more upon its taxable income than could have been demanded under the statute
had the income been derived solely from taxable securities; that to permit this to be done would destroy the
guaranteed exemption for which the bondholder lawfully
contracted, and would enable the Federal Government to
burden the States; and that this cannot be done, whatever the device or form of words employed by Congress.
The argument rests, I think, upon misconceptions.
Some of the tax-exemlft bonds held by the Company
were state (including county, district and municipal)
bonds. Some were United States bonds which in terms
provide for exemptions from federal taxes. With the
holders of state bonds the United States has entered into
no contract. Whatever rights the Company may have
as to them must flow either directly from the terms of the
federal act which provides for the deductions to be made
in computing the net income, or must arise indirectly
out of the Constitution. The objection made, and sustained by the Court, is that the Act is void because thereby Congress taxes the bonds, an instrumentality of the
States, or that it discriminates against the holder. Compare Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124; Metcalf & Eddy
v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, 521-524. As to the United
States bonds, the claim is that the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment is violated, because the Act nullifies
the provision in the bond that it shall be exempt from
federal taxation.4 On this contention the Court does not
4The precise terms of the exemption are not the same in all issues
of United States bonds. Thus, bonds issued under the First Liberty
Loan are declared t6 be "exempt, both as ta principal and as to
interest, from all taxation, except estate or inheritance taxes, imposed
by authority of the United States, or its possessions, or by any State

pass. Compare Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co.,
240 U. S. 1, 25. But it holds, nevertheless, that there
must be deducted the full, 4 per cent of the reserve in
addition to the tax-exempt interest from federal as well
as from state securities. It interprets the will, of Congress to be that such a deduction should be made, because otherwise federal obligations would have less favorable treatment than must be accorded state bonds.
As the tax imposed by the Act of 1921 is on net income,
I should have supposed that it was settled by Flint v.
Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 147, 162, that the inclusion
in the computation of the interest on tax-exempt bonds,
like the inclusion of the receipts from exports, Peck v.
Lowe, 247 U. S. 165; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, 267 U. S
442, 447, or the inclusion in a state tax of receipts from
interstate commerce, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek,
247 U. S. 321, 326; Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, 57;
Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 254 U. S.
113, 120, would not have rendered the tax objectionable.
Compare Interboro Rapid Transit Co. v. Sohmer, 237
U. S. 276, 284. But here it is indisputable that no part
of the income derived from tax-exempt bonds is taxed.
For the statute requires that in computing the taxable
income the full amount of the interest on tax-exempt securities should be deducted. The only question that can
arise in any case is how much additional shall be allowed
as a deduction under paragraph (2).
The only factual basis for complaint by the Company
is that, although a holder of tax-exempt bonds, it is,
or local taxing authority." In the Second and later loans the bonds
are subject to "graduated additional income taxes, commonly known
as surtaxes, and excess-profits and war-profits taxes, now or hereafter
imposed by the United States," except that the interest on an amount
not in excess of a certain figure is free from tax. All the bonds held
by the petitioner were, by the statutes under which they were issued,
exempt from the normal tax.

in respect to this particular tax, no better off than it would
have been had it held only taxable bonds. Or, to put it
in another way, the objection is not that the plaintiff
is taxed on what is exempt, but that others, who do not
hold tax-exempt securities, are not taxed more. But
neither the Constitution, nor any Act of Congress, nor any
contract of the United States, provides that, in respect to
this tax, a holder of tax-exempt bonds, shall be better off
than if he held only taxable securities. Nowhere can the
requirement be found that those who do not hold tax-exempt securities shall, in respect to every tax, be subjected to a heavier burden than the owners of tax-exempt
bonds.
It is true that the tax-exempt privilege is a feature
always reflected in the market price of bonds. The investor pays for it. But the value of the tax-exempt feature, like the value of the bond itself, may fluctuate for
many reasons. Its value may be lessened by changing,
through legislation, the supply or the demand. It may be
lessened by laws which have no relation to taxation, as
was done when the Federal Reserve legislation changed
the basis for securing notes of issue.' The recent successive reductions in federal surtaxes ' lessened for many
holders the relative value of tax-exempt bonds. The narrowing thereby of an existing use for the tax-exempt
bonds was important enough to affect the market value.
Some of the States lessened the value -of United States
bonds to many a holder, when they substituted a small tax

on intangibles, or an income tax, for the heavy general
property tax to which all taxable bonds had theretofore
been subject. The amendment of the state constitution
involved in Florida v. Mellon, 273 U. S. 12, by which
Florida prohibited its Legislature from imposing taxes
on succession or on income, and offered to the rich a haven
of tax immunity, reduced the potential demand for, and
hence the value of, tax-exempt bonds. By all such legislation the relative advantage, with respect to some taxes,
of tax-exempt over taxable bonds was lessened. With respect to other taxes the relative advantage was wholly
removed. And the relative value of the tax-exempt bonds
to the holder was thereby necessarily reduced. But obviously that lessening of relative advantage and of value
did not impair any legal right possessed by the holder. .
The holder of tax-exempt bonds often finds himself
with respect to taxes imposed under legislation other than
the Act of 1921, no better off than 4f he had owned only
taxable bonds. But this' Court has never held a statute
invalid on that ground. A state inheritance or legacy tax
is valid although the tax is as-high when the estate transmitted consists in part of bonds of the United States as
when none are held. Pluminer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115;
Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278.' Compare Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384. This is true also of the tax upon Connecticut savings banks upheld in' Society for Savings v.

not been a holder of United States bonds.7 Similarly it
has been held, in a long line of cases sustaining state laws
taxing shares in a national bank to the shareholders, that
no deduction need be made m the assessment on account
of the United States bonds constituting a part of the assets
of the bank by which the value of the shares is measured.

Moines National Bank v. Fairweather,263 U. S. 103, 114.
The mere fact that the National Life Insurance Company was not allowed a larger deduction than would have
been available if it had held only taxable bonds, cannot,
therefore, render the taxing provision void. Whether
there is in the provision for deductions some. element of
discrimination which renders it unconstitutional, remains
for consideration. It may be assumed-if the term is
used with legal accuracy-that the United States may not
discriminate against state bonds or against its own outstanding bonds. Discrimination is the act of treating
differently two persons or things, under like circumstances.
Compare Merchants Bank v. Pennsylvania,167 U. S. 461,
463. Here the sole complaint is that the two, although
the circumstances are unlike, are treated equally. The
claim is not that the holder of tax-exempt bonds is denied
a privilege enjoyed by others. It is that the holder of
tax-exempt bonds should be given in respect to another
matter a preferred status. The preference claimed is that
it shall be allowed, in addition to tax exemption on its
bonds, a deduction of 4 per cent of the reserve. The Constitution does not require the United States to hold out
special inducements to invest in state bonds, compare
Floridav. Mellon, 273 U. S. 12, 17, nor to give to holders

of its own bonds privileges not granted by its contract
with them. -As was stated by counsel for the amici
curiae: "This allowance of a deduction of a fixed percentage, or 4 per cent of the mean of the reserve, itself
points to the nature of the deduction, not as a right but
as a favor. In granting this favor, in the interest of policyholders, Congress was entitled to consider the deduction already allowed for income on tax-exempt
securities." 8
There is no suggestion that, in fact, Congress discriminated against tax-exempt bonds, or against insurance
companies as holders thereof." In the Senate, it was
8 The brief for the amici curiae states further: "The petitioner has
neither constitutional nor statutory right to deduct from its, income
an amount equal to four per centum of the mean of its reserve or to
deduct any percentage of its reserve funds, or to deduct any interest
derived from the investment of its reserve funds [in. addition to that
from tax-exempt securities]. . . . Every life insurance company
that has tax-exempt securities is treated exactly on the same basis.
Companies thit have tax-exempt securities are not entitled to a double
deduction and those that have no tax-exempt securities still have reserves which they hold for the protection of their policy holders and
Congress has fairly allowed a deduction of a percentage of those
reserves." . . . "This was a mere question of policy which Congress was free to adopt as it chose." . . . "What the petitioner
wants, is not simply to have its constitutional right protected, and to
be immune from taxation on its investment in government securities,
but to get a further advantage, to which it has no constitutional
right, that is, to include its tax exempt income in figuring its deduction on its reserve. It seeks not freedom from taxation, but a preferred position in calculating its reserve. What is there in the Constitution which compels Congress to give such an advantage?" . . .
"The petitioner has no constitutional right to gain an advantage
from its investment in tax-exempt securities beyond the fact that it
is not to be deprived in whole or in part of its investment and that
the investment is not to be made a subject of taxation."

stated that all th'e life insurance companies favored the
measure.1" There is no suggestion of a purpose in Congress to favor some companies at the expense of others.
But even if the possibility of such discrimination appeared, the objection of inequality in operation (if it were
applicable to federal legislation, Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., 240 U. S. 1, 25; La Belle Iron Works v. United
States, 256 U. S' 377, 392; Barclay v. Edwards, 267 U. S.

less well than some other company. See Pullman Co. v.
Knott, 235 U. S. 23, 26; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, 262 U. S.

I find nothing in the cases cited by the petitioner which
lends support to the view that its rights have been violated. Directly to tax the gross income from securities
amounts, of course, to taxing the securities themselves.

other sources were free from the tax. The tax challenged

-each of the cases from the state courts cited, was a, direct
property tax imposed upon federal obligations."1
To hold that Congress may not legislate so-that the tax
upon an insurance company shall be the same whether it
holds tax-exempt bonds .or does-not, would, in effect, be
to read into the Constitution a provision that Congress
must adapt its legislation so as to .give -to state securities,
not merely tax exemption, but additional privileges; and
to read into the contract' of the United States with its
own bondholders a promise that it will, so long as the
bonds are -outstanding, so frame its system of taxation
that its tax-exempt bonds shall, in:respect to all taxes
imposed, entitle the holder to greater privileges than are
enjoyed by holders of taxable bonds. But no rule is better settled than that provisions for tax exemption, constitutional or contractual, are to, be strictly construed.

Moreover, even if the decision of the Court on the main
question be accepted as the rule of substantive law, I am
unable to see how the Company can be allowed to recover
anything. The provision of § 245 is that there shall be
deducted from the gross income: "(2) An amount equal
to the excess, if any, over the deduction specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, [i. e., the interest on taxexempt securities] of 4 per centum of the mean of the
reserve funds required by law." The Court has, of course,
power to declare that the system of taxation established
by Congress is unconstitutional. But I find no power in
the Court to amend paragraph (2) of § 245 so'as to allow
the Company to deduct 4 per cent of its reserves, in addition to its income from tax-exempt securities. Congress
was confessedly under no obligation to allow any deduction on account of the insurance reserves of any company.
To expand the scope of the permitted deduction is legislation-and none the less so because the operation can be
performed by striking out certain words of the act.
The power so to legislate is not conferred on this Court
by § 1403 of the Act. That section declares: "That if
any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of
the Act, and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby."
The limited purpose and the narrow effect of such a clause
was stated by this Court in Hill v. Wallace, 259 U. S. 44,
71. It "furnishes assurance to courts that they may
properly sustain separate sections or provisions of a partly
invalid act without hesitation or doubt as to -whetherthey
would have been adopted, even if the legislature had been
advised of the invalidity of part. But it does not give the
court power to amend the act."
Even if such a clause could ever permit a court to enlarge the scope of a deduction allowed by a taxing statute,
the present case would be wholly inappropriate for the

exercise of such a power. Here the asserted unconstitutionality can be cured as readily by striking out -thewhole
of paragraph (2) as by enlarging it. Section 1403 gives
no light as to which course Congress would prefer. So
far as there are indications elsewhere, they would point to
the former course. The new method of taxation was intended by Congress to procure additional revenue from
the insurance companies. House Report, 67th Congress,
1st Session, No. 350, p. 14. And the deduction permitted
by paragraph (2) was a concession which Congress need
not have made. Whether, in view of these facts, a court
could properly save the Act by striking out paragraph
(2), or whether the alleged unconstitutionality necessarily
renders invalid the whole scheme of taxatiofi-thus leaving in force the tax on insurance companies contained in
the Act of 1918,12 there is no need to consider. Compare
Springfield Gas & Electric Co. v. Springfield, 257 U. S.
66, 69; Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U. S. 286, 290. On either
view there can, in my opinion, be no recovery on the
findings here.

discriminated against, the discrimination occurs only in
respect of an act of bounty. Petitioner's only complaint
is thatCongress has-not granted it as large an exemptionpurely a matter of grace-as it has accorded to others owning no tax-exempt securities.
That tax was repealed by § 1400(a) of the Act of 1921. But
section 1400(b) provides: "in the case of any tax imposed by 'any
part of the Revenue Act of 1918 repealed by this Act, if there is a
tax imposed by this Act in lieu thereof, the provision imposing such
tax shall remain in force until the corresponding tax under this Act
shall take effect under the provisions of this Act." 42 Stat. 227, 321.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
STONE, J., dissenting.

277 U. S.

In granting a bounty of any sort Congress had a particular purpose: the generous protection of insurance reserves in the interest of the policy holders. For that purpose an exemption of 4% of the reserves was considered
sufficient. In the case of companies already entitled to an
exemption of 4%, a further act of bounty was of course
unnecessary to accomplish the end in view. Unless established principles require it, I do not think we should hold
that Congress was powerless to act as generously as was
necessary to achieve its useful purpose without granting
additional and unnecessary bounties to insurance companies fortuitously in possession of tax-exempt bonds.
There is a distinction between imposing a burden and
withholding a favor. By the Constitution or by contract
the holders of tax-exempt securities are protected from
burdens; but from neither source do they derive an affirmative claim to favors. If Congress voted to subsidize all
insurance companies except those holding tax-exempt
bonds, whatever other objections might be made to such a
course I do not think petitioner could complain because it
had not been made the recipient of a gift. For the same
reason I believe that its-present contention is insubstantial.
But even though the result now reached were to be
deemed a logical implication of the doctrine announced in
The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall'. 113, that neither national
nor state governments may tax the instrumentalities of
the other, still, as this Court has often held, that rule may
not be pressed to the logical extreme of forbidding legislation which affects only remotely or indirectly the holders
of the other's securities. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell,
269 U. S. 514, 523. As Mr. Justice BRANDEIs has just
pointed out, " a state inheritance or legacy tax is valid
although the tax is as high when the estate transmitted
consists in part of bonds of the United States as when
none are held"; and this Court has sustained statutes
under which "a corporation holding bonds of the United

States was obliged to pay the same amount in 'taxes that
it would have been required to 'pay if it had not been a
holder of United States bonds." Not all income earned
in the employment of a state is exempt froi federal taxation, Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell,, supra; instrumentalities affecting indirectly or remotely the functions of one
government may nevertheless be taxed by the other,
Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., 224 U. S. 362; Baltimore ShipbuildingCo. v. Baltimore, 195 U. S. 375; Fidel-,
ity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania,240 U. S. 319.
Now, the rule which, under the decisions of-this Court,
has been thus narrowly limited, is extended into a new
field; and the Government is forbidden to grant any benefit or immunity to a tax-payer unless it be extended in
addition to the immunity already assured by reason of his
possession of tax-exempt securities. Here, too, the remedy
is not the cancellation of the benefits to others of which
petitioner complains, but the grant Ito it of an added
bounty which Congress has not authorized and which the
Constitution, it seems to me, neither requires Congress
nor permits this Court to give.

ERROR TO THE SUPREMIE COURT OF MICHIGAN.

--No. 343. Argued March 7, 8, 1928.,-Decided June 4, 1928.
1. A business association of the kind commonly known as "Massachusetts trusts" or "common law trusts" which, under its organic
instrument and the law of the State where it was formed, is a legal
entity with other attributes like those of corporations, including
exemption of its shareholdes and trustees from personal liability
for the acts and engagements of the association, cannot carry on
local business in another State without that State's express or implied permission. P. 548.
