SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 561.

Argued April 19, 20, 1928.-Decided May 21, 1928.

A corporation which had constructed and maintained a very expensive commercial building on ground leased to it for long terms, find662, 663; Fordson Coal Co. v. Maggard, 2 F. (2d) 708; Connecting
Gas Co. v. Imes, 11 F. (2d) 191, 195. On the other hand, in Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Osborne, 265 U. S. 14, the hearing
below was before three judges. In that case, as in this, the Tax Commissioner was joined as a defendant, but apparently no relief could
have been given against him. Where relief by injunction has been
sought against state tax commissions, boards of equalization, and
their members, the practice has been less uniform.. The application
for a temporary'injunction was entertained by a single judge in Johnson v. Wells, Fargo & Co., 205 Fed. 60, 239 U. S. 234 (prior to the
Act of 1913); Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Greene, 244 U. S.

ing the income inadequate to pay profits on the investment, and
desiring to substitute on the same ground a larger building of modem type, but fearing that under the terms of the leases it could
not remove the existing structure without the lessors' consent,
brought suit against them and the trustees for its bondholders, for
the purpose of establishing its right to do so, praying also that the
defendants be restrained from taldng any steps to prevent such
removal. Held that the suit could not be maintained in a federal
court, for:
1. The doubt of the plaintiff's right, arising only on the face of
the leases by which it derived title, was not in legal contemplation a cloud; and a bill to remove it as such would not lie. P. 288.
2. Relief by declaratory judgment is beyond the jurisdiction of
the federal judiciary. P. 289.
3. The proceeding was not a case or controversy within the meaning of Art. III of the Constitution, since no defendant had wronged
or threatened to wrong the plaintiff, and no cause of action arose
from the thwarting of the plaintiff's plans by its own doubts or by
the fears of others. Id.
4. A removed proceeding which is not a suit within the meaning
of Jud. Code ยง 28, must be remanded by the federal court, even
though the remedy sought may be one conferred by state law or
statute. P. 290.

The law of the State must determine the respondent's
title, or whether the title is clouded. Guffey v. Smith,

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Petitioners.

277 U. S.

Under the law of Illinois, doubtful provisions in, an owner's muniment of title and oral hostile assertions by an
adverse claimant, do not constitute a cloud upon that
title. McCarty v. McCarty, 275 Ill. 573; Greenough v.
Greenough, 284 Ill. 416; Rigdon v. Shirk, 127 Ill. 411;
Buckner v. Carr, 302 Ill. 378; Warren v. Warren, 279 Ill.
217; First Congregational Church v. Page, 257 Ill. 472;
Glos v. People, 259 Ill. 332. See Devine v. Los Angeles,
202 U. S. 313.
Bills to remove clouds presuppose the validity and existence of a plaintiff's own title, and are directed exclusively against the alleged invalid claim of a defendant, to
be shown invalid by facts extrinsic to the plaintiff's own
recorded evidence of title. Wehrman v. Conklin, 155 U. S.
314; Lawson v. U. S. Mining Co., 207 U. S. 1; Phelps v.
Harris, 101 U. S. 370.
The case set up by the respondent is not embraced within any principle or head of equity jurisprudence, and is an
application for a declaratory decree not within the judicial function. The essential elements of a justiciable case
or controversy, over which the jurisdiction of courts of
the United States extends, have been stated in Muskrat v.
United States, 219 U. S. 346; United States v. HamburgAmerikanische Co., 239 U. S. 466; United States v. Alaska
Steamship Co., 253 U. S. 113; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269
U. S. 328.
Changing circumstances, or hardships, or lack of commensurate return, do not excuse nonperformance of the
covenants in leases, and, since petitioners are not in the
least responsible for the creation or development of these
conditions, if existent, such conditions are not legal wrongs
for which respondent has any remedy against petitioners.

Argument for Petitioners.

Illinois has no declaratory judgment or other statute
under which jurisdiction can be sustained. This suit,
upon the same considerations, would fail in the state
courts. Seely v. Baldwin, 185 111. 211; Paine v. Doughty,
251 Ill. 396; Pratherv. Lewis, 287 Ill. 304.
A declaratory judgment remedy can not be applied by
the federal courts. Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis,
273 U. S. 70.
There can be no substitution of equitable for legal remedies, whereby the constitutional right of trial by jury in
actions at law is impaired. L. & N. R. R. Co. v. Westem Union, 234 U. S. 369. _ ,
Where the plaintiff's own title is doubtful, a bill in
equity to remove alleged clouds therefrom will not lie.
Phelps v. Harris, 101 U. S. 370; Frost v. Spitley, 121
U. S. 552; Wehrman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314; Seely v.
Baldwin, 185 Ill. 211; Pratherv. Lewis, 287 Ill. 304.
The petitioners were wrongfully prevented from litigating in the courts of the State-by the erroneous refusals
of the federal courts to remand the case.
There is no separable, removable controversy unless
there is a separate and distinct -cause of action as to the
defendants seeking removal, which can be decided as
between them and the plaintiff in the absence of all
other defendants. Torrence v. Shedd, 144 U. S. 527;
Fraserv. Jennison, 106 U. S. 191; Ayres iv. Wiswall, 112
U. S. 187; Wilson v. Oswego Township, 151 U. S. 56.
Where the right. to remove is doubtful, the federal
courts 'uniformly remand. Thomas v. Delta Land &
Water Co., 258 Fed. 758; Boykin v. Morris Fertilizer Co.,
257 Fed. 827; Hansen v. Pacific Coast Asphalt Cement
Co., 243 Fed. 283.
It becomes the duty of a federal court, at whatever
stage of litigation it discerns that federal jurisdiction is
lacking in a removed case, to remand it to the state

Mr. Walter L. Fisher,with whom Messrs. Win. C. Boyden and Win. W. Case were on the brief, for respondent.
When there is a legal right to the beneficial use of
property, when obstacles prevent the present enjoyment
of that right, when the decree of a court of equity would
in fact remove those obstacles without violation of rights
of private individuals or of any principles of public policy,
and when the courts of law afford no adequate remedy, the
jurisdiction of equity is complete.
The doctrine that a right is not cognizable by courts of
justice unless controverted, if possessed of general validity
for any purpose, pertains to the canons of the common
law rather- than to equity. Trustees are constantly applying to the court for instructions, not because the defendants disagree with them about the performance of
their duties, but to protect themselves against the possibility of any such claim at some future time. In suits to
establish title, or to remove clouds on title, equity regularly intervenes to protect the rights of a plaintiff about
which no controversy exists. The owner of a title acquired by adverse possession, the evidence of which is
not a matter of record and might be lost, is entitled to a
decree establishing his title as against the holder of the
patent title, even though such holder may have entirely
abandoned the property. The jurisdiction does'not depend at all on any adverse claim by the defendant. See
Sharon v. Tucker, 144 U. S. 533.
In an ordinary foreclosure suit, parties are joined as defendants on the mere allegation that they have or claim
some junior interest in the property. Such a defendant
may file a .disclaimer, but he cannot sustain a demurrer

WILLING v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM.
274

279

Argument for Respondent.

to the bill on the ground that it fails to show any assertion on his part of an adverse claim. The apprehension
that he might make a claim, and the right of the plaintiff
to the enjoyment of the property free and clear from any
possibility of such claim, is all that is needed to enable
the court to enter a decree against him.
While the present case does in fact disclose a wrong,
consisting of unfounded assertions made before suit was
begun and reiterated in pleading and by argument during
its progress, we do not believe that equitable jurisdiction
is conditioned by the assertion or existence of any such
wrong. The ownership of property includes a right to its
beneficial use; that right is coeval' with the ownership
and does not come into being for the first time when somebody disputes it; and it is one of the ordinary and most
useful functions of equity to render such a right available
by the removal of obstacles to its enjoyment. The utmost
that can be requirbd is that there must be in fact a real
obstacle to the free enjoyment of the right. Cf. Gavin v.
Curtin,171 Ill. 640; Fulwiler v. McClun, 285 Ill. 174.
It is a grave error to picture equity as a congeries of
stereotyped forms of action outside of which its remedial
powers cannot operate. The issue thus raised goes to the
very foundation of equitable jurisdiction.
If the bill must bear a label already in stock, the suit
can best be described as one to remove cloud on title,
or as a bill in the nature of a bill to remove cloud from
title. Holland v. Challen, 110 U. S. 15; 32 Cyc. 1308; 18
Har. L. Rev., 528; McArthur v. Hood Rubber Co., 221
Mass. 372.
As for the alleged effect of Illinois law, the authorities only "go to the extent of holding that a state statute
enlarging the jurisdiction to remove cloud on title creates
a substantive right which may be enforced in a federal
court; they lend no countenance to the claim that state

courts or even state legislatures can in any manner narrow the definition of a cloud on title so as to cut down
the inherent jurisdiction of the federal courts with respect to the removal thereof. McConihay v. Wright, 121
U. S. 201; Guffey v. Smith, 237 U. S. 101; Holland v.
Challen, 110 U. S. 15; Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195; Pusey
& Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261 U. S. 491.
It is one thing to say that an impediment of some particular sort is not one which, standing alone, equity will
assume jurisdiction to remove, and quite another to say
that equity cannot remove it as a part of the relief to
which a suitor is justly entitled. With this distinction
kept in view, we think it easy to show that the remedy
sought in the present suit would have been accorded by
the Illinois courts. Parker v. Shannon, 121 1ll. 452;
Seely v. Baldwin, 185 I1. 211; Greenough v. Greenough,
248 Il1. 416; Harrison v. Owsley, 172 11. 629; Buckner

Warren v. Warren, 279 I1. 217; Fulwiler v. McClun, 285
Ill. 174.
Equity is not prevented from assuming jurisdiction of
a meritorious case merely because it involves features
which, when isolated, have been pronounced insufficient
in themselves to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction.

Railway Co., 270 U. S. 378.
As to oral assertion of adverse claims: That equity has
no inherent jurisdiction merely to construe deeds or interpret contracts is a proposition which may be accepted as
axiomatic. That mere verbal assertions of an adverse
claim are not enough, without further incident, to create
a removable cloud, is a proposition generally true. What
gives equity jurisdiction to construe deeds or contracts in-

Argument for Respondent.

volving only legal titles is an actual emergency in which
its aid is indispensable to assure to an owner the beneficial
use of his property, and "mere verbal assertions" will
not call equity into action unless they relate to a similar
situation. Thompson v. Emmett IrrigationDistrict,227
Fed. 560; Oman v. Bedford-Bowling Green Stone Co., 134
Fed. 64; Lovell v. Marshall, 162 Minn. 18; Siegel v. Herbine, 148 Pa. St. 236.
That there was affirmative assertion of adverse claim is
shown by this record.

Given a primary right to the beneficial use of. property,
and an obstacle to its present enjoyment which would in
fact be removed by an appropriate decree, the lack of
adequate remedy at law is the sole anrd sufficient criterion
of equitable jurisdiction. 1 Pomeroy, Eq. Jur., ยง 111;
Toledo Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania Co., 54 Fed. 746; Dodge

Waiting until somebody else chooses to start a lawsuit

As for declaratory judgments, it is doubtless true that
courts ordinarily refuse to enter judgments declaring
rights with respect to which no present cause or controversy exists; but this doctrine does not affect the jurisdiction of equity to remove clouds from title.
The complicated problems incident to modern social,
commercial, and industrial development often make it
very important that the rights of parties be settled before
they are directly involved in litigation. Generally the
courts have not shirked the task when the necessity of an
adjudication was sufficiently urgent, but they have been
and are naturally reluctant to take jurisdiction of questions of a remote or speculative character, and they have
not always been at one about the degree of vexatiousness
that will warrant such intervention.

MR. 'JUSTICE BRANDEiS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This suit, which was begun .in a state court of Illinois
by the Chicago Auditorium Association, is said to be in
the nature of a bill to remove a cloud upon title. All of
the parties except a few of the defendants are citizens of
Illinois. These claimed that as to them there was a
separable controversy, and they secured a removal of the
whole cause to the federal court for northern Illinois.
There 'Willing and other defendants moved to dismiss on
the ground that the bill was not within the jurisdiction
of a court of equity and that the court "is without jurisdiction of the subject matter of the case, made or at-

277 U. S.

tempted to be made by the bill." The court was of opinion that the case presented questions which should be determined only upon answers and proofs; denied the motions to dismiss, without prejudice to any question raised
by either party touching the motions; 'and directed the
defendants to answer.. After hearing the case fully on
the evidence, the District Court dismissed the bill "for
want of equity jurisdiction in the court to grant any relief
upon the pleadings and the evidence, but without prejudice to whatever rights the plaintiff may have
when asserted in any appropriate proceeding or otherwise." 8 F. (2d) 998.
The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the suit was
cognizable in a court of equity as one to remove a cloud
upon title; and it reversed the decree with direction to
the District Court to hear the evidence and determine the
issues involved, 20 F. (2d) 837. This Court granted a
writ of certiorari, 275 U. S. 519. Motions by Willing and
others to remand the case to the state court had been
made in the District Court on the ground that the controversy involved was single and entire as to all the deTfendants. The motions, which that court denied, were
renewed in the Circuit Court of Appeals and again denied.
We have no occasion to consider whether the alleged controversy was separable. For we are of opinion that the
proceeding does not present a case or controversy within
the range of judicial decision as defined in Article III of
the FederalRConstitution. -g
The facts alleged and proved are these: The Association, an Illinois corporation, was organized in 1886 for the
purpose of constructing and maintaining in Chicago a
building containing a large augditorium, galleries for
exhibition of works of art, officesnd other rooms; to provide thereby and otherwise, for the cultivation of music,
the drama and the fine arts, and for holding in Chicago
political and other conventions; and to use the premises

WILLING v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM.
274

Opinion of the Court.

for any and all purposes of profit. To this end, the Association became, in 1887, the ground lessee of five adjacent parcels of land for the term of 99 years, under five
separate, substantially similar indentures. Three of the
leases were later extended to the year 2085. On this land
the Association built, before 1889, the single monumental
structure now standing, known as the Auditorium Building, which contains, besides the auditorium, a recital hall,
studios, a hotel, and many business offices. The cost of
construction and maintenance was defrayed by stock issues aggregating $2,000,000, and by issues of bonds of
which $1,375,000 are outstanding.
The building is now in fairly good condition, and continues to serve well the purposes for which it was constructed. The payments of rent and interest have been
made regularly. Thus neither the public, the landlords,
nor the bondholders have cause for dissatisfaction. But,
for the stockholders, the investment has never been
financially remunerative. In forty years only one dividend has been paid; and that was one and a half per cent.
Considered as a financial investment, the building is now
obsolete in design; and it is incapable of alteration without unjustifiable expense. The highest and best use of
the property for the financial gain of the tenant would
now be the replacement of this structure by a modern one
adapted for business. The Association desires to erect a
large modern commercial building of greatly increased
height, the cost of which may be as much as $15,000,000.
Appropriate changes in its charter powers have been
made. Recently some of the stock has been acquired by
the President of the corporation at a small fraction of its
par value.
There is no provision in the leases which in terms gives
the Association the right to tear down this building and
erect another in its place. It may be that the building,
as and when constructed, became, and now is, property

286

of the lessors. Compare Kutter v. Smith, 2 Wall. 491;
Bass v. Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railway Co.,
82 Fed. 857. The leases contain certain provisions which
may be construed as denying, by implication, any right to
tear down the building even to replace it by a better one.
They declare that the building is security for payment of
rent and for the performance of all other covenants imposed upon the tenant; that the tenant shall "keep the
building situated upon said demised premises . . . in
good repair, and in a safe and secure condition, .
and all rooms in said building in a good, safe, clean and
tenantable condition and repair during the entire term
of this lease "; that the tenant shall rebuild or repair the
building, in event of damage or destruction by fire, upon
the same plan as was followed in the original structure
or upon such other plans as are approved by the lessors;
and that the landlords shall pay the tenant the appraised
value of the improvements at the end of the term.
Counsel for the Association are of opinion that it has
the legal right to tear down the building and to construct
the new one, without first obtaining the consent of the
several lessors and of the trustee for the bondholders, provided adequate security is furnished for the payment of
the ground rent pending the completion of the new building. But the Association deemed it advisable to obtain
the consent of the lessors and of the trustee. To that end,
negotiations were opened with Willing and one other of
the lessors, and there was some talk of purchasing their
interests. In the course of an informal, friendly, private
conversation, Willing stated to the President of the Association that his counsel had advised that the lessee had no
right to tear down the Auditorium Building without the
consent of the lessors and of the trustee for the bondholders. Several of the lessors were never approached by anyone on behalf of the Association. Nor was the trustee for
the bondholders. After this talk with Willing, a year

passed without further occurrence. Then, the suit .atbar
was begun against all the lessors and the trustee foi the
bondholders.
The bill alleged that "under the proper construction
and interpretation of the terms, covenants and conditions
of said several leases, your orator is fully empowered and
has the right to tear down and remove the present improvement as a part of and incidental to the erection of
a new improvement of equal or greater value not impairing in any way the security and property right of the said
lessors or their successors and assigns, upon furnishing
proper and adequate security during the removal of the
present improvement and until the completion of the new
improvement; but the defendants hereinafter named, or
some of them, nevertheless claim and assert, and by reason
of such claim and assertion certain persons with whom
your orator is obliged to deal in the financingof its aforesaid plans are fearful, that the present. building cannot be
removed without a violation of the terms, covenants and

fears and uncertainties respecting the rights of the parties
to said leases, based upon the terms, covenants and conditions of the leases of said property, have greatly impaired
the value of the"leasehold interests of your orator, and
have made them unmarketable, and have prevented your
orator from exercising its rights with respect to said leasehold interests so as to secure therefrom the highest and
best use of its interest in the land; and the terms, covenants and conditions of the said leases, in so far as they
give color to said claims, fears and uncertainties, are
clouds upon the title of your orator, for the removal of
and relief against which your orator has no adequate
remedy in a court of law."
The bill prayed "that this court will remove from the
several leasehold interests of your orator the above mentioned claims and clouds based upon the alleged force and

effect of the terms, covenants and conditions of the aforesaid leases, and will fully quiet and establish the title of
your orator to the said leasehold pr6perties with full right
on the part of your orator to tear down and remove any
and all buildings which for the time being may be upon
said premises, upon giving proper security . . . '; and
that said defendants may also be restrained and enjoined
from taking any steps to prevent your orators from tearing down or removing the present building
.
There is not in the bill, or in thq evidence, even a suggestion that any of the defendants had ever done anything which hampered the full enjoyment of the present
use and occupancy of the demised premises authorized by
the leases. There was neither hostile act nor a threat.
There is no evidence of a claim of any kind made by any
defendant, except the expression by Willing, in an amicable, private conversation, of an opinion on a question of
law. Then, he merely declined orally to concur in the
opinion of the Association that it has the right asserted.
For that, or for some other reason, several of the defendants had refused to further the Association's project.
Other defendants had neither done nor said anything
about the matter to anyone, so far as appears. Indeed,
several refrained, even in their answers; from expressing
any opinion as to the legal rights of the parties.
Obviously, mere refusal by a landlord to agree with a
tenant as to the meaning and effect of a lease, his mere
failure to remove obstacles to the fulfillment of the tenant's desires, is not'an actionable wrong, either at law or
in equity. And the case lacks elements essential to the
maintenance in a federal court of a bill to remove a cloud
upon title. The alleged doubt as to plaintiff's right under
the leases arises on the face of the instruments by which
the plaintiff derives title. Because of that fact, the doubt
is not in legal contemplation a cloud, and the bill to remove it as such does not lie. It is true that the plight of

which the Association complains cannot be remedied by
an action at law. But it does not follow that the Association may have relief in equity in a federal court. What
the plaintiff seeks is simplya declaratory judgment. To
grant that relief is beyond the power conferred upon the
federal judiciary. Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, 273
U. S. 70, 74. Compare Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley
Tobacco Growers Ass'n, 276 U. S. 71. The statement,
made at the bar, that Blairv. Chicago, 201 U. S. 400, 450,
supports the jurisdiction, is unfounded.
It is true that this is not a moot case, like Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Wright, 141 U. S. 696, and United States
v. Alaska S. S. Co., 253 U. S. 113; that, unlike Keller v.
Potomac Electric Co., 261 U. S. 428, 444, and Postum
Cereal Co. v. CaliforniaFig Nut Co., 272 U. S. 693, the
matter which it is here sought to have determined is not
an administrative question; that the bill presents a case
which, if it were the subject of judicial cognizance, would
in form come under a familiar head of equity jurisdiction; that, unlike Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697,
a final judgment might be given; that, unlike South Spring
Hill Gold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining
Co., 145 U. S. 300, the parties are adverse in interest; that,
unlike Fairchildv. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, and Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, there is here no lack of a
substantial interest of the plaintiff in the question which
it seeks to have adjudicated; that, unlike New Jersey v.
Sargent, 269 U. S. 328, the alleged interest of the plaintiff is here definite and specific; and that there is here no
attempt to secure an abstract determination by the court
of the validity of a statute, as there was in Muskrat v.
United States, 219 U. S. 346, 361, and Texas v. Interstate
Commerce Commission, 258 U. S. 158, 162. But still the
proceeding is not a case or controversy within the meaning
of Article III of the Constitution. The fact that the plaintiff's desires are thwarted by its own doubts, or by the

290

STONE, J., concurring

fears of others, does not confer a cause of action. No
defendant has wronged the plaintiff or has threatened to
do so. Resort to equity to remove such doubts is a proceeding which was unknown to either English or American
courts at the time of the adoption of the Constitution
and for more than half a century thereafter, Cross v. De
Valle, 1 Wall. 1, 14-16. Compare Jackson v. Turnley, 1
Drew. 617, 627; Rooke v. Lord Kensington, 2 K. & J.
753, 760; Lady Langdale v. Briggs, 8 DeG. M. & G. 391,
427.
As the proceeding is not a suit within the meaning of
ยง 28 of the Judicial Code, the motions to remand the
cause to the state court should have been granted.
Stewart v. Virginia, 117 U. S. 612; Upshur County v.
Rich, 135 U. S. 467; Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Oregon
Water Board, 241 U. S. 440, 447. Whether, as the respondent contends, it has a remedy under the law of Illinois, we have no occasion to consider. Fulwiler v. McClun, 285 Ill. 174. Compare McCarty v. McCarty, 275
Ill. 573; Greenough v. Greenough, 284 Ill. 416; Devine
v. Los Angeles, 202 U. S. 313, 334-335. Even a statute
of the State could not confer a remedial right to proceed
in equity in a federal court in a suit of this character.

Reversed.
Concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE STONT.
I concur in the result. It suffices to say that the suit
isplainly not one within the equity jurisdiction conferred
by ยงยง 24, 28, of the Judicial Code. But it is unnecessary,
and I am therefore not prepared, to go further and say
anything in support of the view that Congress may not
constitutionally confer on the federal courts jurisdiction
to render declaratory judgments in cases where that form
of judgment would be an appropriate remedy, or that this

Court is without constitutional power to review such
judgments of state courts when they involve a federal
question. Compare Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co.
v. Swope, 274 U. S. 123, 130-134. "It is not the habit of
the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature
unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case."
Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295. See Blair v.
United States, 250 U. S. 273, 279; Flint v. Stone Tracy
Co., 220 U. S. 107, 177; Light v. United States, 220 U. S.
523, 538. There is certainly no "case or controversy"
before us requiring an opinion on the power of Congress
to incorporate the declaratory judgment into our federal.
jurisprudence. And the determination now made seems
to me very similar itself to a declaratory judgment to the
effect that we could not constitutionally be authorized to
give such judgments-but is, in addition, prospective,
unasked, and unauthorized under any statute.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 404. Argued April 11, 1928.-Decided May 21, 1928.
1. Western railroads with termini at St. Louis' (the "west-side"
roads) exchanged traffic with railroads east of the Mississippi
(the " ast-side" roads) by means of a terminal company owned
jointly or controlled by appellants and appellees. (See Terminal
R. R. Ass'n v. United States, 266 U. S. 17.) In order to meet
the competition on through freight of the Chicago and Alton
and other western railroads which reached East St. Louis by
means of independent crossings, the "west-side" roads had long
made the same rates on that point as on St. Louis, absorbing the
Terminals transfer charges on west-bound as well as east-bound
traffic. The "east-side" roads bore no part of such charges and
where, as in most cases, their St. Louis and East St. Louis rates

were the same, they were limited by appropriate tariff provisions
