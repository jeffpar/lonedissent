The policy was taken out by the insured and was payable to his estate. It is true that the amended answer
alleged that all the premiums were paid by the Dazey
State Bank, but this was denied on information and belief
in the reply, and no evidence was produced in its support.
None of the evidence received or excluded had any bearing
upon the circumstances under which the policy was issued.
Whether if such evidence had been offered, it should have
been excluded because of the provisions of the North
Dak6ta statutes making policies incontestable after two
years, or for other reasons, compare Finnie v. Walker, 257
Fed. 698, we have no occasion to consider. Plainly the
assignment of the policy later would not render it void;
whatever the lack of insurable interest on the part of the
assignee. Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U. S. 149. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed with direction that the judgment of the District Court be
affirmed.

No. 569.

Argued April 26, 27, 1928.-Decided May 28, 1928.

1. The business of an employment agent is not one "affected with a
public interest "; and, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a State cannot fix the fees which such an agent
may charge for his services. P. 355.
2. The power to require a license for, and to regulate the conduct of,
a business, is distinct from the power to fix prices. P. 358.
3. The fact that a business lends itself peculiarly to the practice of
fraud, extortion and discrimination may be ground for regulation,
but not for price-fixing. P. 358.

There is no monopoly, or danger of monopoly, in the
operation of employment agencies. They are numerous,
and it requires no great amount of capital to start new
ones. Nineteen States have established competitive free
state employment agencies, and in at least seven others
there are municipal agencies. An organization has been
established called the "American Association of Public
Employment Offices," which is seeking to put the private
agencies out of business. These facts appear in the publications utilized by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissenting opinion in Adams v. Tanner,supra. Business schools,
trade schools, Y. M. C. A's, Y. W. C. A's, college bureaus,

typewriter companies, and bar associations, maintain
agencies, while the "want" columns of newspapers contribute an entirely different kind of competition. It is
also a well-known fact that the labor unions of the country frequently conduct employment offices, and that
many large employers of labor secure their recruits
through established employment departments. Under
these conditions, it appears that the business of an employment agency is distinctly a private business of a
highly competitive nature, with no known tendencies
toward monopoly.
From the very nature of the business, there cannot he
any uniformity in respect of the conditions under which
it is carried on. An attempt to establish a uniform fee
for the more valuable service and the less valuable service, without regard to the expenses of overhead-which
make possible the more valuable service-would seem to
be hopelessly impracticable within the limits of constitutional rights.
In a business like insurance, each single insurance contract is not a single and separate transaction, but is so
involved that it affects the whole or a large part of the
entire mass of insurance transactions. That is not true
of employment agencies.
Employment agencies-and emphatically those dealing
with clerical, engineering and executive positions--are certainly not as much affected with a public interest as wages
and rentals; and this Court has held that price-fixing is
not a valid exercise of the legislative power in those
businesses, except temporarily in case of emergencies.

New Jersey, with whom Mr. Edward L. Katzenbach
Attorney General, was on the brief, for defendant in error.

RIBNIK v. McBRIDE.
350

Argument for Defendant in Error.

The business is one so involved with public interest
and concern as to warrant its regulation by the State.
Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340; Adams v. Tanner,
242 U. S. 590.
A State may regulate fees to be charged by employment agencies. Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113; Budd v.
New York, 143 U. S. 517; Brass v. North Dakota, 153
U. S. 391; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S.
389.
In the above cases, this Court, in effect, held that the
right to regulate rates or fees depended upon the necessity of so doing in order properly to regulate the business
itself. In at least twenty-one States the amount of fee
which may be charged is "controlled either by fixing a
specified fee for the service or limiting the charge to a
percentage of the wages. It would thus appear that the
regulation of the fee has been found essential to regulating
the business. All of these States have, in effect, declared not only that the business has superimposed upon
it a public interest requiring its regulation, but also that
that public, interest necessitates that the fees charged
should be reasonable.
It can scarcely be argued that the action of the New
Jersey legislature in limiting these fees was either unwise or arbitrary, in view of the nature of the business
and the abuses which might result from -unlimited
charges. Cf. Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365.
The increase in urban population resulting in great
bodies of unemployed in congested districts, and the consequent competition for employment, leading to compliance with any fee demanded by employment agencies, is
ample reason for concluding that the public good required
the regulation and justified the Act complained of,

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Chapter 227, Laws of New Jersey, 1918, p. 822, being
an act to regulate the keeping of employment agencies,
requires that every person operating an employment
agency as defined by the statute must procure a license
from the Commissioner of Labor. A penalty is imposed
for failure to do so. The application for such license must
be made in writing to the Commissioner of Labor and,
among other requirements, the applicant must "file with
the Commissioner of Labor, for his approval, a schedule
of fees proposed to be charged for any services rendered
to employers seeking employees, and persons seeking employment, and all charges must conform thereto. The
schedule of fees may be changed only with the approval
of the Commissioner of Labor." The Commissioner of
Labor may refuse to issue or may revoke any license for
any good cause shown within the meaning and purpose of
the act.
Plaintiff in error filed with the state Commissioner of
Labor a written application for a license to conduct an
employment agency. All conditions of the statute were
complied with; but the commissioner rejected the application upon the sole ground that, in his opinion, the fees
proposed to be charged in respect of certain permanent
positions were excessive and unreasonable. This action
of the commissioner was brought up for review to the
supreme court of the state, and that court construing the
statute as empowering the commissioner to fix and limit
the charges to be made by the applicant, nevertheless sustained it as constitutional under the due process of law
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 4 N. J. Mis. R.
623. Upon appeal to the state court of errors and appeals, the judgment was affirmed. 103 N. J. L. 708.

RIBNIK v. McBRIDE.
350

Opinion of the Court.

That the state has power to require a license and regulate the business of an employment agent does not admit
of doubt. But the question here presented is whether the
due process of law clause is contravened by the legislation attempting to confer upon the Commissioner of Labor power to fix the prices which -the employment agent
shall charge for his services. The question calls for an
answer under the last of the three categories set forth by
this Court in Wolff Co.v. IndustrialCourt, 262 U. S. 522,
535, that is to say: Has the business in question been devoted to the public use and an interest in effect granted
to the public in that use? Or, in other words, is the business one "affected with a public interest," within the
meaning of that phrase as heretofore defined by this
Court? As was recently pointed out in Tyson & Brother
v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418, 430, the phrase is not capable
of exact definition; but, nevertheless, under all the decisions of this Court from Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, it
is the standard by which the validity of price-fixing legislation, in respect of a business like that here under consideration, must be tested.
In the Tyson case it was said (p. 430) that the interest
meant was not "such as arises from the mere fact that the
public derives benefit, accommodation, ease or enjoyment
from the existence or operation of the business; and while
the word has not always been limited narrowly as strictly
denoting 'a right,' that synonym more nearly than any
other expresses the sense in which it is to be understood."
The business must be such (p. 434) "as to justify the
conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its
use thereby, in effect, granted to the public." And again
(p. 438) after reviewing former decisions, it was said that
"each of the decisions of this court upholding governmental price regulation, aside from cases involving legislation to tide over temporary emergencies, has turned

356

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business
under consideration, which bore such a substantial and
definite relation to the public interest as to justify an indulgence of the legal fiction of a grant by the owner to
the public of an interest in the use."
In Wolff, Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, p. 537, it was
said:
"It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the
Constitution, that the business of the butcher, or the
baker, the tailor, the wood chopper, the mining operator
or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that
the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by
State regulation. . . . one does not devote one's
property or business to the public use or clothe it with a
public interest merely because one makes commodities for,
and sells to, the public in the common callings of which
those above mentioned are instances."
In Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525, this
Court had under consideration an act of Congress fixing
minimum wages for women and children in the District
of Columbia. The legislation, so far as it affected women,
was held invalid as contravening the due process of law
clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it was an arbitrary interference with the right to contract in respect
of terms of private employment. It was said (p. 546) that
while there was no such thing as absolute freedom of contract, nevertheless, freedom of contract was the general
rule and restraint the exception; and that "the exercise
of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only
by the existence of exceptional circumstances."
The business of securing employment for those seeking
work and employees for those seeking workers is essentially that of a broker, that is, of an intermediary. While
we do not undertake to say that there may not be a deeper
concern on the part of the public in the business of an
employment agency, that business does not differ in sub-

RIBNIK v. McBRIDE.
350

Opinion of the Court.

stantial character from the business of a real estate broker,
ship broker, merchandise broker or ticket broker. In the
Tyson case, supra, we declared unconstitutional an act
of the New York legislature which sought to fix the price
at which theatre tickets should be sold by a ticket broker,
and it is not easy to see how, without disregarding that
decision, price-fixing legislation in respect of other brokers
of like character can be upheld.
An employment agency is essentially a private business.
True, it deals with the public, but so do the druggist, the
butcher, the baker, the grocer, and the apartment or
tenement house owner and the broker who acts as intefmediary between such owner and his tenants. Of course,
anything which substantially interferes with employment
is a matter of public concern, but in the same sense that
interference with the procurement of food and housing
and fuel are of public concern. The public is deeply interested in all these things. The welfare of its constituent
members depends upon them. The interest of the public
in the matter of employment is not different in quality
or character from its interest in the other things enumerated; but in none of them is the interest that "public
interest" which the law contemplates as the basis for
legislative price control. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court,
supra, p. 536. Under the decisions of this Court it is no
longer fairly open to question that, at least in the absence
of a grave emergency, Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra,
pp. 431, 437, the fixing of prices for food or clothing, of
house rental or of wages to be paid, whether minimum or
maximum, is beyond the legislative power. And we perceive no reason for applying a different rule in the case of
legislation controlling prices to be paid for services rendered in securing a place for an employee or an employee
for a place.
Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340, cited by defendant
in error lends no support to the judgment below. That

277 U. S.

case involved the validity of a Michigan statute in respect
of employment agencies. Section 5 of the act attempted
to limit the fees which should be charged. The state
supreme court held that the business was one properly
subject to police regulation and control, but did not rule
concerning the validity of ยง 5. This Court held that it
was within the power of the state to require licenses for
employrent agencies and prescribe reasonable regulations
to be enforced by the Commissioner of Labor. But it
was said (p. 344):
"Provisions of ยง 5 in respect of fees to be demanded or
retained are severable from other portions of the act and,
we think, might be eliminated without destroying it.
Their validity was not passed upon by the Supreme Court
of the State and has not been considered by us."
And we since have held definitely that the power to
require a license for and to regulate the conduct of a business is distinct from the power to fix prices. "The latter
power is not only a more definite, and serious invasion of
the rights of property and the freedom of contract, but
its exercise cannot always be justified by circumstances
which have been held to justify legislative regulation of
the manner in which a business shall be carried on." Tyson
& Brother v. Banton, supra, p. 431; and see pp. 440-441.
To urge that extortion, fraud, imposition, discrimination
and the like have been practiced to some, or to a great,
extent in connection with the business here under consideration, or that the business is one lending itself
peculiarly to such evils, is simply to restate grounds already fully considered by this Court. These are grounds
for regulation but not for price fixing, as we have already
definitely decided. Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra,
44Z-445.
There are a number of states which have statutes like
that now under consideration, and we are asked to give
weight to that circumstance. It is to be observed, how-

ever, that with the exception of the decision now under
review none of these statutes has been judicially considered, except in the State of California, where the legislation was declared unconstitutional. Ex parte Dickey,
144 Cal. 234; In re Smith, 193 dal. 337. And it was said
in oral argument, and not disputed, that, while legislation
of this character existed in several states, generally it was
not enforced, in some instances because the state's attorney-general had advised that the legislation was unconstitutional. In any event, under all the circumstances,
and in the face of our prior decisions, we do not regard
the mere existence in other states of statutory provisions
like the one now under review as entitled to persuasive
force.

concurring.

I concur in this result upon the controlling authority
of Tyson v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418, which, as applied to
the question in this case, I am unable to distinguish.
MR. JUSTIcE STONE, dissenting.

The question is whether a state has constitutional
power to require employment agencies to charge only
reasonable fees for their services to those seeking employment. As the case is presented we must take it that the
New Jersey Commissioner of Labor was right in holding
that Ribnik's list of fees was unreasonably high.
Under the decisions of this Court not all price regulation, as distinguished from other forms of regulation, is
forbidden. As those decisions have been explained, price
regulation is within the constitutional power of a state
legislature when the business concerned is "affected with
a public interest." That phrase is not to be found in the
Constitution. Concededly it is incapable of any precise
definition. It has and can have only such meaning as

277 U. S.

ltiay be given to it by the decisions of this Court. As I
read those decisions, such regulation is within a state's
power whenever any combination of circumstances
seriously curtails the regulative force of competition, so
that buyers or sellers are placed at such a disadvantage
in the bargaining struggle that a legislature might reasonably anticipate serious consequences to the community as a whole. Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113; Brass
v. Stoeser, 153 U. S. 391; German Alliance Insurance Co.
v. Kansas, 233 U. S. 389, 409; Terminal Taxicab Co. v.
District of Columbia, 241 U. S. 252; Block v. Hirsh, 256
U. S. 135; Marcus Brown Co. v. Feldman, 256 U. S. 170;
Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, 258 U. S. 242; see also Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, 183 U. S. 13; McLean v.
Arkansas, 211 U. S. 539; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, 222
U. S. 225; Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. 160. The
price regulation may embrace businesses "which though
not public in their inception may fairly be said to have
risen to be such and have become subject in consequence
to some governmental regulation." Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, 262 U. S. 522, 535. The use by the public
generally of the specific thing or business affected is not
the test. The nature of the service rendered, the exorbitance of the charges and the arbitrary control to which the
public may be subjected without regulation, are elements
to be considered in determining whether the "public interest" exists. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, 538.
The economic disadvantage of a class and the attempt to
ameliorate its condition mar alone be sufficient to give
rise to the "public interest" and to justify the regulation of contracts with its members, Knoxville Iron Co. v.
Harbison, supra; McLean v. Arkansas, supra; Mutual
Loan Co. v. Martell, supra, and obviously circumstances
may so change in point of time or so differ in space as to
clothe a business with such an interest which at other

RIBNIK v. McBRIDE.
350

STONE, HOLMES,

and BRANDEIS, JJ., dissenting.

times or in other places would be a matter purely of
private concern. Block v. Hirsh, supra, 155.
I cannot say a priori that the business of employment
agencies in New Jersey lacks the requisite "public interest." We are judicially aware that the problem of unemployment is of grave public concern; that the conduct
of the employment agency business bears an important
relationship to that larger problem and affects vitally the
lives of great numbers of the population, not only in New
Jersey but throughout the United States; that employment agencies, admittedly subject to regulation in other
respects, Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340, and in fact
very generally regulated, deal with a necessitous class,
the members of which are often dependent on them for
opportunity to earn a livelihood, are not free to move
from place to place, and are often under exceptional
economic compulsion to accept such terms as -the agencies
offer. We are not judicially ignorant of what all human
experience teaches, that those so situated are peculiarly
the prey of the unscrupulous and designing. In Adams v.
Tanner, 244 U. S. 590, a statute of Washington which
in effect attempted to abolish the business was held unconstitutional because employment agencies were deemed
not "inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare,"
but, as was there emphasized, capable, under regulation,
of being conducted in a useful and honest manner. But
it was not questioned that the business was subject to
grave abuses, involving frauds and impositions upon a
peculiarly helpless class, among which the exaotion of
exorbitant fees was perhaps the least offensive. The
Supreme Court of New Jersey, in an opinion in the present case which was adopted by the Court of -Errors and
Appeals, said: "It is common knowledge that an employment agency is a business dealing with a great body
of our population, native and foreign born, which is

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
STONE, HOLMES, and BRANDEIs,JJ., dissenting.

277 U. S.

susceptible to imposition, deception and immoral in"
fluences.
In dealing with the question of power to require reasonable prices in this particular business, we should remember what was specifically pointed out by the Court in
Tyson v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418, 438, that whether a business is affected with a "public interest" turns "upon the
existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration." In the respects mentioned, or most of them,
and in others to be pointed out, it seems to me that there
is a marked difference between the character of this business and that of real estate brokers, ship brokers, mechandise brokers, and, more than all, of ticket brokers, who
were involved in Tyson v. Banton, supra. There the attempt was made to limit the advance which brokers
might charge over box office prices for theatre tickets, an
expedient adopted to break up their monopolistic control
of a luxury, not a necessity. Those affected by the practices of the ticket brokers constituted a relatively small
part of the population within a comparatively small area
of the State of New York. They were not necessitous.
The consequences of the fraud and extortion practiced
-upon them were not visited upon the community as a
whole in any such manner as are fraud and imposition
practiced upon workers seeking employment. Here the
effort is made, as in Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison,supra;
McLean v. Arkansas, supra; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell,
supra; Erie R. R. v. Williams, 233 U. S. 685, first, to protect from abuses a class unable to protect itself, for whose
welfare the police power has often been allowed broad
play, and, second, to mitigate the evils which unemployment brings upon the community as a whole.
Some presumption should be indulged that the New
Jersey legislature had an adequate knowledge of such local
conditions as the circumstances of those seeking employ-

RIBNIK v. McBRIDE.
350

STONE, HOLMES,

and BRANDEIS, JJ., dissenting.

ment, the number and distribution of employment agencies, the local efficacy of competition, the prevalent practices with respect to fees. On this deserved respect for
the judgment of the local lawmaker depends, of course,
the presumption in favor of constitutionality, for the
validity of a regulation turns "upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration."
Tyson v. Banton, supra, 438. Moreover, we should not,
when the matter is not clear, oppose our notion of the
seriousness of the problemor the necessity of the legislation to that of local tribunals. "This Court, by an unbroken line of decisions from Chief Justice Marshall to
the present day, has steadily adhered to the rule that
every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of
an act of Congress until overcome beyond rational doubt."
Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525, 544. And
the enactments of state legislatures are entitled to no less
respect. If, therefore, our consideration of the general
conditions surrounding employment agencies, which it was
thought in Brazee v. Michigan, supra, made them subject
to regulation, was to go no further than that of the Court,
I should still have supposed that plaintiff in error had
not sustained the burden which rests on him to show that
this law is unconstitutional. ErieR. R. v. Williams, supra*
But even if the presumption is not to be indulged, and the
burden no longer to be cast on him who attacks the constitutionality of a law, w6 need not close our eyes to available data throwing light on the problem with which the
legislature had to deal. See Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S.
412, 420-421; McLean v. Arkansas, supra, 549.
For thirty years or more the evils found to be connected with the business of employment agencies in the
United States have been the subject of repeated investigations, official and unofficial, and of extensive public
comment. They have been the primary reason for the

establishment of public employment offices in the various
States.'
Quite apart from the other evils laid at the door of the
private agencies,2 the data supplied by these investigations and reports afford a substantial basis for the conclusion of the New Jersey legislature that the business is
peculiarly subject to abuses relating to fee-charging, and
1 As early as 1912 free employment offices were maintained by at
least fifteen states,--Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Wisconsin; and by municipalities
in California, Montana, New Jersey and Washington. The State of
New York had maintained an office in New York City as early as
1896; and in Nebraska a statute providing for an office had been
passed but no appropriation had been made for its maintenance.
See Statistics of Unemployment and the Work of Employment Offices, U. S. Bur. of Labor, Bull. No. 109, pp. 35, 36. The authors of
the inquiry conducted for the Russell Sage Foundation reported,
"One conclusion drawn from [our] findings has been that we must
have public bureaus to take the place of the private fee-charging
agencies. That is, in so far as people are informed on the question
and have expressed their sentiments, most of them appeared convinced that we should have public employment bureaus because of
the abuses of some fee-charging agencies quite regardless of other
considerations. In addition, however, the feeling has been growing
that this service in the nature of the cise should be free, and that the
very fact of fee-charging carries with it a dangerous temptation to
abuse and fraud." Public Employment Offices, Harrison and others
(1924) p. 5. Compare Report of New Jersey Bureau of Statistics of
Labor and Industries, 1893, pp. 73-78.
2 The numerous governmental reports on the undesirable practices
of the agencies, other than those relating to fee-charging and therefore not directly material here, are summarized in the opinion of Mr.
Justice Brandeis in Adams v. Tanner, 244 U. S. 590, 597-616. See

that for the correction of these the restriction to a reasonable maximum charge is the only effective remedy. These
data, to be gathered from numerous independent and public investigations, may be briefly summarized as follows:
First. They show that the agencies, left to themselves,
very generally charge extortionate fees. The Commission on Industrial Relations, created by Act of August 23,
1912, c. 351, 37 Stat. 415, reported to Congress at a time
when prices were materially lower than today, "Fees are
often charged out of all proportion to the service rendered. We know of cases where $5, $9, $10, and even $16
a piece has been paid for jobs at common labor. In one
city the fees paid by scrubwomen is at the rate of $24 a
year for their poorly paid work." 8 . Exorbitant fees are
taken for merely registering the applicants, no effort
whatever being made to find them work.4 To stimulate

the payment of such fees the agencies advertise for classes
of laborers for whom no jobs are available.' According
to the Massachusetts Commission to Investigate Employment Offices, the ordinary forces of competition seem
powerless to prevent or remedy this situation, because but
little capital is required to open an office, and because the
clients of the agencies are constantly new.'
Second. These data show that the fees charged are
often discriminatory. It is made known in slack season
that but few jobs are available and that to these will be
referred the applicants who tender the larger "extra fees"
private employment agencies had been conducted with ordinary honesty and efficiency, the striving for a greater degree of justice to the
worker would not have 'been able to make any headway against the
accepted doctrine of individualism, which assumes that privately conducted businesses are always preferable to publicly conducted businesses. The irregularities and abuses of the private employment
agencies, however, became too notorious to be overlooked.
"The charges usually preferred against private employment agencies concern the fees exacted, the practices in referring applicants to
jobs, and the places where the employment agencies are frequently
located. Fees for registration were, and still are, charged by many
private employment agencies, although these agencies make no effort
to render any service in return for the fee. If the registered applicant makes a complaint, he is asked to pay an extra fee on the promise of getting first consideration. The fees charged are oftentimes
exorbitant."

June 19, 1906, c. 3438, 34 Stat. 304, 307, enacted by Congress for the

fair opportunity for employment is not secured within four days;
and provides that "the whole fee and any sums paid by the applicant for transportation in going to and returning from such employer
shall be refunded within four days of demand, if no employment of
the kind applied for was vacant at the place to which the applicant
was directed."

or "presents." I There is ground for the belief that this
is a particular danger in New Jersey, for a large proportion of its agencies specialize in employees for hotels and
rebrts where the positions are seasonal and temporary. 8
The whole supply of labor must, at the beginning and
again at the end of the season, search for new positions at
the same time.
Third. Fee-splitting has been a recurrent subject of
complaint. It "is frequently practiced, part of the fee
charged to the worker being paid over by the private
employment agent to the employer or his foreman. This
practice is closely akin to job selling by foremen and superintendents.
. . Both 'fee-splitting' and 'job-selling' result in short time employment and frequent discharges, for each time a job is filled a new fee is ' split' or
a fresh price exacted. The resultant wastage from accelerated labor turnover, from extortionate and multiplied
fees, from demoralization of workers, from unemployment
and irregularity of employment is incalculably great."

During a labor shortage the private agencies in New Jersey have
been found to use a different device to stimulate fees artificially.
After the war many of the women drawn by it into.industry failed to
return to domestic work. In the consequent shortage of domestics,
the agencies encouraged women to change jobs, collecting a new fee
at each change. Report of New Jersey, Dept. of Labor, 1919, pp.
144-146. Section 9 of the act provided by Congress for the District
of Columbia, supra, provides, "That no such person [. e., licensed

employee to leave his employment with a view to obtaining other
employment through such agency."

While their fees are unregulated, the private agencies are
free to charge those seeking employment enough to cover
both the charge for their service and the gratuity paid
to the foreman or employer. A legislature would certainly not be unreasonable in concluding that the fixing
of a reasonable maximum fee was the appropriate and
only effective method of assuring private agencies fair
compensation while preventing them from abuses of this
character.
Fourth. It is reported that at times of widespread unemployment the private agencies are known to raise their
fees out of all proportion to the reasonable value of their
services. 10 There is a public interest at such times in
9This practice has been reported as prevalent in railroad building
where it is known as the "three gang system"-at any one time
there is one gang, just discharged, on its way home; another at work
but on the point of being dismissed; a third, hired by the agency and
on its way to the job. See Public Employment Offices, Harrison and
others, supra, p. 550. Compare Report of U. S. Bureau of Immigration, 1907, pp. 70-71; id., 1911, pp. 121-122; Report of U. S.
Immigration Commission, 61st Cong., 3d Sess., Sen. Doc. No. 747,
Vol. II, pp. 321; 391-408; 443-449.
The Congressional act passed for the District of Columbia, supra,
provides (ยง 8): "No such licensed person shall divide fees with contractors or their agents or other employers or anyone in their employ
to whom applicants for employment are sent."
10 " In the summer, when employment is plentiful, the fees are as
low as 250, and men are even referred to work free of charge. But
this must necessarily be made up in winter when work is scarce. At
such times, when men need work most badly, the private employment
offices put up their fees and keep the unemployed from going to work
until they can pay $2, $3, $5 and even $10 and more for their jobs.
This necessity of paying for the privilege of going to work, and paying more the more urgently the job is needed, not only keeps people
unnecessarily unemployed, but seems foreign to the spirit of American freedom and opportunity." Report of Commission on Industrial
Relations, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., Sen. Doc. No. 415, Vol. I, p. 110.

bringing about a prompt readjustment of the labor supply
to industry's need for labor. The additional barrier to a
quick readjustment created by the agencies' raising of
their rates affects that interest adversely. The establishment of a reasonable maximum rate n is well calculated to obviate the abuse.
Fifth. Finally, it is pointed out that the private agencies
charge the employee and do not charge the employer for
a service that is rendered to both. The convenience of
being furnished with employees is similar to that of being
directed to a position; but less effort is required to collect
compensation for the whole service from the employee
alone. His necessities are normally greater. His bargaining power is normally weaker. The setting of a maximum
fee need not mean-in New Jersey, does not mean-that
an absolute limit is placed on the agency's return. The
agency may still charge the employer in addition for such
service as is rendered to him.'
The establishment of
reasonable fees is thus, in one aspect, merely a method of
"- The usual practice of the legislatures is, of course, not to fix one
fee to be charged regardless of the type of position furnished, but to
group employment offices according to their classes of clients and
promulgate different fee schedules for the different groups. See Report of Massachusetts Commission to Investigate Employment Offices,
1911, pp. 26-28.

It is of course true that the enactment of a particular
type of legislation, even though general, and a widespread
and competent opinion that it is wise and necessary, do
not establish its constitutionality. But that such legislation has been enacted and continued in force over considerable periods of time and in widely separated areas,
and is supported by a concurrence of informed opinion,
may not be disregarded in determining, first, whether the
conditions peculiar to the business under consideration
make it one in which, as in insurance companies, there is
a paramount public concern; and, second, whether the
regulation adopted is xeasonably calculated to safeguard
that interest. See Muller v. Oregon, supra, 420-421;
McLean v. Arkansas, supra.
Examination of the various reports of public bodies and
the legislation referred to can, I think, leave no doubt
that the practices of the private agencies with respect to
their fees presented a problem for legislative consideration
different from any other that this Court has passed on
in ruling on the power to regulate prices, but certainly
more akin to that in Munn v. Illinois, supra,and Germian

regulated as to price, the validity of the statute at hand
would seem to me to be beyond doubt. Certainly it would
be difficult to show a greater necessity for price regulation.
It is said that if there be abuses in this business, the
business may be regulated but not by the fixing of reasonable prices, and that that was decided in Tyson v. Banton,
supra. So far as the significant facts in that case are concerned, it bears little resemblance to this one. Ticket
brokers and employment brokers are similar in name:
in no other respect do they seem alike to me. To overcharge a man for the privilege of hearing the opera is one
thing; to control the possibility of his earning a livelihood
would appear to be quite another. And I shall not stop
to argue that the state has a larger interest in seeing that
its workers find employment without being imposed upon,
than in seeing that its citizens are entertained. Here,
too, if the business is subject to regulation, as seems to be
admitted, the regulation which is appropriate and effective
is some curtailment of the exorbitant fees charged and
not some other form of control which would have no
tendency to correct the evils aimed at.
I cannot accept as valid the distinction on which the
opinion of the majority seems to me necessarily to depend,
that granted constitutional power to regulate there is any
controlling difference between reasonable regulation of
price, if appropriate to the evil to be remedied, and other
forms of appropriate regulation which curtail liberty of
contract or the use and enjoyment of property. Obviously, even in the case of businesses affected with a
public interest, other control than price regulation may
be appropriate, and price regulation may be so inappropriate as to be arbitrary or unreasonable, and hence
unconstitutional. To me it seems equally obvious that
the Constitution does not require us to hold that a business, subject to every other form of reasonable regulation,

374

277 U. S.

is immune from the requirement of reasonable prices,
where that requirement is the only remedy appropriate
to the evils encountered. In this respect I can see no
difference between a reasonable regulation of price and
a reasonable regulation of the use of property, which
affects its prices or economic return. The privilege of
contract and the free use of property are as seriously cut
down in the one case as in the other.
To say that there is constitutional power to regulate
a business or a particular use of property because of the
public interest in the welfare of a class peculiarly affected,
and to deny such power to regulate price for the accomplishment of the same end, when that alone appears to be
an appropriate and effective remedy, is to make a distinction based on no real economic difference, and for which I
can find no warrant in the Constitution itself nor any
justification in the opinions of this Court.
The price paid for property or services is only one of
the terms in a bargain; the effect on the parties is similar
whether the restriction on the power to contract affects
the price, or the goods or services sold. Apart from the
cases involving the historic public-callings, immemorially
subject to the closest regulation, this Court has sustained
regulations of the price in cases where the legislature
fixed the charges which grain elevators, Brass v. Stoeser,
supra; Budd v. New York, 143 U. S. 517, and insurance
companies might make, German Alliance Insurance Co.
v. Kansas, supra; or required miners to be paid per ton of

size, Schmidinger v. Chicago, 226 U. S. 578. In each of
these cases the police power of the state was held broad
enough to warrant an interference with free bargaining
in cases where, despite the competition that ordinarily
attends that freedom, serious evils persisted.
Similar evils are now observed in the conduct of employment agencies. I see no reason why a state may not
resort to the same remedy. There may be reasonable
differences of opinion as to the wisdom of the solution
here attempted. These I would be the first to admit.
But a choice between them involves a step from the judicial to the legislative field. Erie R. R. v. Williams,
supra, 699; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, supra;
Munn v. Illinois, supra, 132. That choice should be left
where, it seems to me, it was left by the Constitutionto the States and to Congress.
