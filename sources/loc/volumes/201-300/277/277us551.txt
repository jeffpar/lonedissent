UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 337. Argued April 24, 25, 1928.-Decided June 4, 1928.
1. The power of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in determining whether a corporation is entitled, under § 327 (a) and (b) of
the Revenue Act of 1918, to have its war and excess profits taxes
fixid by a special assessment under § 328 by a comparison with the
taxes of other, representative corporations engaged in a like or
similar trade or business, is discretionary in character; and the
power of the Board of Tax Appeals in reviewing such determination under the Revenue Act of 1924 is likewise discretionary, and
executive, in character. Pp. 558, 562.
2. Under the Act ot 1918, the Court of Claims, in a suit to recover
taxes alleged to have been illegally collected, was without jurisdiction to review a determination of the Commissioner refusing a
special assessment under §§ 327 and 328; nor was such jurisdiction
conferred on that court as the result of the provision made in the
Act of 1924 for review of the Commissioner's determination by the
Board of Tax Appeals. Pp. 561, 562.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Petitioner.

277 U. S.

The decision of this Court in Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., 275 U. S. 220, is controlling in this case.
The only theory upon which there could be jurisdiction
in the Board of Tax Appeals, and still no jurisdiction in
the federal courts, would be that Congress vested in the
Board some particular added judicial power not heretofore exercised by the courts. The statute discloses the
exact contrary. The Board has the most limited jurisdiction and merely serves to give the taxpayer an additional hearing before he is compelled to pay. § 900 (k),
Act of 1924. In the event the decision is against the
taxpayer, he will be required to pay the tax according
to the assessment and have recourse to the courts for the
recovery thereof. If the decision is against the Government, it will likewise have recourse to the courts.
The Senate committee, in reporting the tax bill, recognized clearly that a case under §§ 327 and 328 can be
taken to court after a Board of Tax Appeals decision.
No additional statutory jurisdiction having been conferred on the courts respecting such cases, they must have
had this jurisdiction before the Board was created.
The court must compute the correct tax in every case
where overpayment is contended by the taxpayer. In
United States v. Emery, 237 U. S. 28, and Rock Island
R. R. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, this Court stated, in
substance, that it was the Commissioner's duty to determine, assess and levy the tax, but that does not mean
that a federal court may not compute the tax correctly
when the Commissioner refuses to do it. To say that a
court is without jurisdiction to compute and determine
the correct tax is simply to say, in effect, that a court is
without jurisdiction to render a judgment for a refund.
It is well settled that there can be no remedy by mandamus. Nor can there be any remedy by injunction to
restrain the Collector. Graham v. du Pont, 262 U. S.
234. If there be any possible way to test the legality or

correctness of the amount of an income tax exaction other
than to pay the tax and sue to recover, what can it be?
Solicitor.General, Mitchell for the United States.
In Blairv. Oesterlein Machine Co., 275 U. S. 220, it was
held that the statutes giving the Board of Tax Appeals
authority to review decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on determination of deficiencies were not
subject to the limitation that the decisions of the Commissioner making or refusing special assessments under
§§ 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918, were not open
to_ review.
The question here is whether the statutes giving to the
Court of Claims jurisdiction, to entertain suits to recover
taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, read
in connection with §§ 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of
1918, deny to the court the power to review the decisions
of the Commissioner under those sections. We have been
unable to find -any ground for contending that the cases
are distinguishable. If the statute giving the Board of
Tax Appeals general jurisdiction to review the decisions
of the Commissioner on deficiencies was not subject to
any qualification as to special assessments, we see no reason why the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims
to award judgment for taxes illegally or erroneously
assessed or collected should be so limited.
At present the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals
are reviewable in the Circuit Court of Appeals. If the
decisions of the Commissioner under the special assessment sections are reviewable in the courts under that procedure, ,wesee no reason why they should not -be reviewable in the courts where the other course is followed and
suit is commenced in the district court or the Court of
Claims for the collection 'or the tax alleged to have been
erroneously assessed.
Notwithstanding the decision in Blair v. Oesterlein
Machine Company, the Court of Claims adheres to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U S.

view that it has no jurisdiction in these special assessment cases, and it is necessary to submit the matter for
the decision of this Court. The principal point seems
to be that the Court of Claims cannot grant relief in such
cases, because the determination of the true tax under
§§ 327 and 328 involves an assessment of the tax. The
Court of Claims also contends that its jurisdiction to
award recovery for taxes illegally collected is limited to
cases where the correct section of the Revenue Act has
been applied by the Commissioner, but erroneously applied, and that where, as in this case, the Commissioner
has applied § 301, which prescribes the general formula,
and has refused to apply the special assessment sections,
the Court of Claims may not itself determine what the
true tax should have been under the special assessment
sections.

filed a brief as amici curiae, by special leave of Court.
MR.JusTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Williamsport Wire Rope Company brought this
action in the Court of Claims, on December 19, 1924, to
recover the amount of an alleged overpayment of excess
profits and war profits taxes for the calendar year 1918,
laid under the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,
40 Stat. 1057. The petition alleged the following facts:
The Company had conceded in its return, and had paid,
a total tax of $306,381.77, for the year 1918. In April,
1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue levied upon
it an additional assessment of $89,094.85, which the Company paid under protest. On June 10, 1924, a portion of
the sum so paid was refunded. Four days later, the Company filed a claim for a further refund of $100,000. The
claim alleged that for reasons there set forth, which are

as provided in section 328:
(a) Where the Commissioner is unable to determine the invested
capital as provided in section 326;
(b) In the case of a foreign corporation;
(c) Where a mixed aggregate of tangible property and intangible
property has been paid in for stock or for stock and bonds and the
Commissioner is unable satisfactorily to determine the respective
values of the several classes of property at the time of payment, or
to distinguish the classes of property paid in for stock and for bonds,
respectively;
(d) Where upon application by the corporation the Commissioner
finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without
benefit of this section would, owing to abnormal conditions affecting
the capital or income of the corporation, work upon the corporation
an exceptional hardship evidenced by gross disproportion between the
tax computed without benefit of this section and the tax computed
by reference to the representative corporations specified in section
328.
See. 328 (a). In the cases specified in section 327 theax shall be

case of a foreign corporation the tax shall be computed without
deducting the specific exemption of $3,000 either for the taxpayer or

the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, and the demurrer was sustained. 63 Ct. Cls. 463. The case is here on certiorari.
275 U. S. 520.
In its petition for a writ of certiorari, the Williamsport
Company alleged that its rights would presumably be determined by the decision in Blair v. Oesterleim Machine
Co., a case then pending in this Court; and the Solicitor
General, being of the same opinion, did not feel justified
in opposing the granting of the writ. Decision on the
petition was postponed pending decision of the Oesterlein
case. That case, 275 U. S. 220, was decided November 21,
1927. We there held that the exercise of the judgment or
discretion of the Commissioner tor allow or deny the special
assessment provided for in §§ 327 and 328 was subject to
review by the Board of Tax Appeals; and that therefore
the taxpayer was entitled to an order compelling the Commissioner to respond to the subpoena of the Board issued
under § 900(i) of the Revenue Act of.1924, c. 234, 43
Stat. 253, 338, requiring him to answer interrogatories and
to furnish information contained in the returns of other
corporations. On November 28, the writ of certiorari in
this case was granted. Thereupon, the Williamsport
Company moved, presumably in analogy to motions to

(c) The Commissioner shall keep a record of all cases in which
the tax is determined in the manner prescribed in subdivision (a),
containing the name and address of each taxpayer, the business in
which engaged, the amount of invested capital and net income shown
by the return, and the amount of invested capital as determined
under such subdivision. The Commissioner shall furnish a copy of
such record and other detailed information with respect to such casewhen required by resolution of either House of Congress, without
regard to the restrictions contained in section 257.

affirm under Rule 6, that the judgment against it be reversed on the authority of the Oesterlein, case. The
Solicitor General, while not opposing the motion, advised
us that the Court of Claims had, since the decision of the
Oesterlein case, adhered to the view that it was without
power to determine whether the Commissioner of Jnternal Revenue had erred in refusing to-make a special assessment under § § 327 and 328. We then assigned the
case for oral argument, without passing on the motion
to reverse and remand.
The contention here is that, since the Commissioner's
action was made reviewable on appeal by the Board of
Tax Appeals, it is and was always reviewable in an original
proceeding before the Court of Claims. The argument is
that Congress has conferred upon the Court of Claims
jurisdiction over suits to recover taxes alleged to have
been "erroneously or illegally assessed or collected;" 2
that here its jurisdiction is invoked to recover taxes
claimed to have been assessed illegally, because assessed
under § 301 instead of under §§ 327 and 328; that it must
therefore have power to determine whether conditions
existed which entitled the Company to the special assessment provided for by §§ 327 and 328; that if it finds that
such condition did exist, it must also have power to de-termine the true amount of the tax computed as therein
directed; and that if it' appears that the tax actually paid
exceeds that which would have been exacted under the
special assessment, the Court may award judgment for
the difference.

Recent statutes have used this phrase in.describing the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims and the District Courts over suits by taxpayers to recover taxes. See Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, §§ 1310(c),

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S

Sections 327 and 328 were intended to broaden the
powers of relief first conferred by § 210 of the War Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 3073 It was "believed necessary to provide a special method of determining the tax for those cases in which the ordinary method
of assessment would result in grave hardship or serious
inequality." Senate Report, 65th Cong. 3d Sess., No. 617,
p. 14. The special assessment is to be made under paragraph (a) when the Commissioner "is unable to determine the invested capital." It is to be made under paragraph (d) if he "finds and so declares of record that the
tax if determined without the benefit of this section would
. . . work . .
an exceptional hardship
"
The task imposed on the Commissioner by §§ 327 and 328
was one that could only be performed by an official or
a body having wide knowledge and experience with the
class of problems concerned. For the requirement of a
special assessment under paragraph (d) of § 327 and its
computation in all cases, are dependent on "the average
tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or
similar trade or business." 4
Section 210 was liberally construed by the Treasury. See Regulations 41, art. 52 (T. D. 2694).
4 At the time of passing the 1918 act Congress had before it the
Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for 1918. The
Commissioner said of the administration of § 210 of the Act of 1917:
"Returns filed under section 210 presented even more difficult problems as to the amount of invested capital that could properly be set
up as being equivalent to the invested capital of representative concerns engaged in 'a like or similar trade or business.' Consequently,
it was necessary for the Bureau to assemble, as promptly as possible,
returns filed under these sections of the law and analyze them in the
light of the facts disclosed by normal returns. Thousands of cases
were examined in detail and subjected to comprehensive statistical
studies to determine normal percentages of income to invested capital
in different lines of business under varying conditions" and circum-

WILLIAMSPORT CO. v. UNITED STATES.
551

559

Opinion of the Court.

To perform that task, power discretionary in character
was necessarily conferred.5 Whether, as provided in paragraph (d) of § 327, there are "abnormal conditions;"
whether, because of these conditions, computation under
§ 301 would work "exceptional hardship;" whether there
would be "gross disproportion" between the tax computed under § 301 and "that computed by reference to the
representative corporations specified in section 328;"
what are "representative corporations engaged in a like
or similar trade or business; " which corporations are "as
nearly as may be, similarly circumstanced with respect to
gross income, net income, profits per unit of business transacted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war
profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and
circumstances "--these are all questions of administrative
discretion.
The soundness of the judgment exercised by the individual or body to whom the task was confided would depend largely upon the extent both of the knowledge of
the special subject possessed and of the experience had
in dealing with this particular class of problems. The conclusions reached would rest largely upon considerations
not entirely susceptible of proof or disproof. Congress
did not, by the Revenue Act of 1918, require the Commissioner to embody the results of his deliberation in findings of fact. The purpose of the meagre record prescribed
by § 328(c) in case the Commissioner concludes to order
a special assessment is apparently to protect the Treasury,
stances in order that a mode of procedure might be defined for treatment of cases under sections 209 and 210." P. 12.

not the taxpayer.' For if the Commissioner refuses to
make the special assessment, he is not required to state
the grounds of his refusal, or, indeed, even to record the
fact of such refusal. Thus the aims which induced Congress to enact § § 327 and 328, the nature of the task which
it confided to the Commissioner, the methods of procedure prescribed, and the language employed to express
the conditions under which the special assessment is required, all negative the right to a review of his determination by a court.
It is true that where the Commissioner's action is reviewable judicially, his findings of fact in making an assessment, as distinguished from his determinations involving administrative discretion, constitute only prima
facie evidence; and that, in cases arising under the internal
revenue laws, such findings are commonly reviewable by
courts in appropriate proceedings in which the facts become an issue. United States v. Rindskopf, 105 U. S. 418,
422; Wickwire v. Reinecke, 275 U. S. 101, 105. It is also
true that in reviewing the Commissioner's findings on such
matters as value, compare Castner,Curran & Bullitt, Inc.
v. Lederer, 275 Fed. 221; Little CahabaCoal Co. v. United
States, 15 F. (2d) 863; allowances for depreciation, compare Cohen v. Lowe, 234 Fed. 474; Camp Bird, Ltd. v.
Howbert, 262 Fed. 114; or the accuracy with which a taxpayer's books reflect his income, compare In re Sheinman,
14 F. (2d) 323, courts may be confronted with problems
requiring a high degree of technical knowledge for their
solution. But such problems involve primarily the situation of a single taxpayer, and the controlling data can

easily be made available to the court. Here, the considerations which demand special assessment under § 327 (d),
and those which govern its computation in all cases, are
facts concerning the situation of a large group of taxpayers which can only be known to an official or a body
having wide experience in such matters and ready access
to the means of information.
The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, if any, rests
on statutory provisions which long antedate the Revenue
Act of 1918. Its jurisdiction over suits to recover taxes is
based on the clause in the original Act -of February 24,
1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612, empowering it to determine
"all claims founded upon any law of Congress." United
States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 569; Dooley v. United
States, 182 U. S.222. Compare United States v. Emery,
Bird, Thayer Co.,-237 U. S.28. But we have held that the
Court of Claims is without jurisdiction where the statute
creating the claim expressly refers it for final determination to an executive department. United States v. Babcock, 250 U. S.328, 331. And that it is equally without
jurisdiction where from an exaination of all the terms
of the statute it appears that Congress intended to vest
final authority in an administrative agency. United States
v. Atchison, Topeka-& Santa Fe Ry. Co., 249 U. S.451;
Silberschein v. United States, 266 U. S. 221. Long ago
Congress conferred final authority upon such an agency
in the enforcement of the appraisal provisions by which
the amounts payable, under the customs laws are determined. Compare Bartlett v. Kane, 16 How. 263, 272;
Hilton v. Merritt, 110 U. S.97, 105; Passavantv. United
States, 148 U. S.214.'
Moreover, whatever jurisdiction is possessed by the
Court of Claims to review 'determinations under §§ 327
and 328, would be possessed also by the district courts
in suits against collectors and in actions against the United
States, under § 24(20) of the Judicial Code. Thus the

determinations of the Commissioner in this delicate and
complex phase of revenue administration would be subjected to review by a large number of courts, none of
which have ready access to the information necessary to
enable them to arrive at a proper conclusion in revising
his decisions; whose experience in passing upon questions
of this character would be limited; and whose varying
decisions would tend to defeat, rather than promote, that
equality in the application of the revenue law which §§
327 and 328 were designed to insure. We conclude that
the determination whether the taxpayer is entitled to the
special assessment was confided by Congress to the Commissioner, and could not, under the Revenue Act of 1918,
be challenged in the courts-at least in the absence of
fraud or other irregularities.
It remains to consider whether jurisdiction to review
the Commissioner's action was conferred upon the Court
of Claims as a result of the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924,
c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 336, which created the Board of Tax
Appeals. There is nothing in that Act which purports
to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims or to
extend the scope of judicial review over determinations of
the Commissioner. The contention that it had this effect
rests wholly on our decision in Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., 275 U. S. 220. The contention fails to take
account of the important differences between an appeal to
the Board of Tax Appeals, on the one hand, and an original suit in the Court of Claims, or in a district court, on
the other. The Board of Tax Appeals was created to perform the administrative functions therktofore discharged
by the Committee on Appeals and Review, which the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue had established in
his office.7 See House Report, 68th Cong. 1st Sess., No.

nations granting or denying special assessment under
§§ 327 and 328.8 The granting of these powers of review
to the Board of Tax Appeals did not change the character
of the appeal. And it affords no reason to conclude that
Congress intended that the Court of Claims and the district courts should also be authorized to reexamine the
decisions of the Commissioner on questions of the character here involved.
It is true that, unlike the Committee, the Board of Tax
Appeals is not a part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
The Board is an independent agency. But, by specific
provision of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, § 900(k),
43 Stat. 253, 338, it was defined as an agency "in the
executive branch of the Government." Compare Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U. S. 117, 121-122.
Its sole function consists in reviewing, on appeal, determinations of the Commissioner under the revenue laws.
The fact that the Commissioner is a party to all cases be-

fore it enables the Board, by rules of procedure which it
has developed, to leave to the Commissioner the initial
determination of many questions requiring the use of facts
