As was said in the Oesterlein, ease,

for making determinations under §§ 327 and 328 than this
administrative agency specially established to review his

Board decides that the petitioner is so entitled, the Commissioner
shall file within 60 days after such decision, a proposed redetermination showing the basis and method of the computation. If, within
20 days after service by the Board upon the petitioner of a copy of
such proposed redetermination, the parties are unable to agree on the
amount of the tax, either party may move or the Board on its own
motion may order that the case be placed on the calendar for further hearing. See also Rule 50, Settlement of Final Determination,
as amended April 28, 1928.

Commissioner was -being investigated by a Select Committee of the
Senate at the very time when Congress had the Revenue Bill of 1924
under consideration. See Hearings before the Select Committee on

ON A MOTION for leave to file a petition for a writ of
mandamus requiring a district judge to set aside an order
refusing an interlocutory injunction and to call in two
additional judges, under § 266 of the Judicial Code, in a
suit by an abutting property owner to enjoin execution
of a resolution for the paving of a city street.
Messrs. John W. Ray, Joseph C. Niles, and J. D. Collins, pro se, were on the brief for petitioner.
MR. JusTicE BRANDEis delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a motion for leave to file in this Court a petition for a writ of mandamus to be directed to District
Judge Jacobs of the federal court for Arizona. In a suit
pending before that court the petitioner Collins, having
made application for an interlocutory injunction, and
having notified the Governor and the Attorney General
of the State, requested Judge Jacobs to call two additional judges to sit with him as provided in § 266 of the
Judicial Code as amended. Judge Jacobs denied the
request and, sitting alone, denied the interlocutory injunction. The petitioner thereupon filed this motion.
In the accompanying petition, he prays that Judge
Jacobs be directed to set aside his order denying the
injunction, and to call two judges to sit with him at the
hearing. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy. Ex

parte Williams; ante, p. 267. But as we deem it clear
that the case is not within the scope of § 266, we deny
leave to file the petition. Compare Ex parte Buder, 271
U. S. 461.
The defendants in the suit are the City of Phoemx,
Arizona, and Schinidt-Hitchcock, Contractors, a private
izori~a corporation. The purpose of the suit is to enjoin the city, its officers, and the contractor, from proceeding under b, resolution adopted by the city directing
the paving of a street on which the petitioner is an
abutting owner. The improvement was to be made
pursuant to a general statute of ,Arizona, Civil Code,
1913, Title VII, c. XIII, and the cost was to be defrayed
by bonds issued, pursuant to another general statute, Session Laws, 1919, c. 144. They provide that the cost of
the improvement shall be assessed against abutting property according to the benefit received, and that a lien
shall thereon arise for the amount assessed. The petitioner claims that the statutes make no proper provision
for giving the property owner a hearing, and that therefore they contravene the due process clause of the Fourteenth Ainendment to the Federal Constitution. SchmidtHitchcock objected to the calling of additional judges on
the ground that the case did not fall within the purview
of § 266, but was merely one in which it was sought to
prevent a municipal corporation and its officers from
proceeding with a municipal improvement.
The suit is not one to restrain "the enforcement, operation, or execution" of a' statute of a State within the
meaning of § 266. That section was intended to embrace a limited class of cases of special importance and
requiring special treatment in the interest of the pilblic.
Senator Burton said of the amendment -to the Commerce Court
Act which later became § 266: "It evidently recognizes the superior
degree of consideration and sanction which should be given to a state
statute, and prevents hasty interference with the action of a sovereign
. state." 45 Cong. Rec. V253,

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

The lower courts have held with substantial unanimity
that the section does not govern all suits in which it is
sought to restrain the enforcement of legislative action,
but only those in which the object of the suit is to
restrain the enforcement of a statute of general application or the order of a state board or commission. Thus,
the section has long been held inapplicable to suits seeking to enjoin the execution of municipal ordinances,2 or
the orders of a city board.' And likewise it has been
held that the section does not apply where, as here,
although the. constitutionality of a statute is challenged,
the defendants are local officers and the suit involves
matters of interest only to the particular municipality
or district involved.' Despite the generality of the language, we think the section must be so construed.

Opinion of the Court.

Congress realized that in requiring the presence of
three judges, of whom one must be a Justice of this
Court or a circuit judge, it was imposing a severe burden
upon the federal courts." The burden was imposed because Congress deemed it unseemly that a single district
judge should have power to suspend legislation enacted
by a State. That the section was intended to apply only
to cases of general importance is shown by the provision
that notice of the hearing must be given to the Governor
and the Attorney General-a precaution which would
scarcely be deemed necessary in a suit of interest only to
a single locality. Support for that view is found also in
the provision for a stay of the suit in case there shall have
been brought in a court of the State a suit to enforce the
statute or order. That the provisions of § 266 applied to
cases of unusual gravity was recognized by Congress in
1925, when, in limiting the right of direct appeal from
the District Court to this Court, it carefully preserved
that right in cases falling within the section. Cases like
the present are not of that character. If the temporary
injunction had been issued, the result would have been
merely to delay a municipal improvement. Though
here the alleged unconstitutionality rests in the enabling
statute, the case does not differ substantially from one
where the sole claim is that a city ordinance is invalid.
Moreover, the enabling act is not itself being enforced
within the meaning of § 266. That act merely authorizes
further legislative action to be taken by the city, as by
the resolution here in question. It is that municipal
action, not the statute of a State, whose "enforcement,
operation, or execution" the petitioner seeks to enjoin.
Motion denied.
it does not appear that the propriety of such a hearing was considered. See also Browning v. Hooper, 3 F. (2d) 160, 161; Smith v.
Wilson, 273 U. S. 388.
