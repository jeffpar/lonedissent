If title to the vessels described in Cause No. 5 was
actually taken, the United States became liable for their
value. For any use of such vessels before acquisition of
title the United States should pay. The allegations of
the petition are not entirely clear and should be made
more definite.
The judgments appealed from are reversed. The causes
will be remanded to the Court of Clainm for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion,

useful arts by obtaining from inventors a public announcement of their progressive achievements. in exchange for the monopoly, granted to them for a limited

Neither the federal.purpose behind the patent powers
given to Congress by the Constitution nor the patentee's
right to exclude is hampered in any-way by stater taxation
of the net income of the patentee computed upon a gross
income in which is included patent royalties. Once a
patent is granted, it is within the power of a state to legislate within a wide range of discretion with respect to the
exercise of the patent rights and to the use and manufacture of patented articles, so long as no interference
with the right to exclude takes place. Patterson v.

appear that the interest in question bears some substantial and intimate relation to the continued operation of a
federal constitutional purpose. A patent is merely the
reward given for the disclosure of an invented process by
virtue of a contract with the government which--by its
terms includes no provision that the reward or its avails
shall be exempt from state taxation. By far the greater
number of cases dealing with the implied prohibition of
the exercise of the States' taxing power with respect to
federal instrumentalities have dealt with the taxation by
the State of property interests in active use in accomplishing a decided federal purpose. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines,
205 U. S. 503; FarmersBank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516;

It can hardly be said that the patentee is in any sense
an agent of the Federal Government, yet even if he were
'such an agent, he. could be taxed with respect to the
property employed by him as such an agent so long as
no governmental function performed by him was taxed.
RailroadCo. v. Penistdn, 18 Wall. 5, so clearly supports
the jurisdiction of a State under the Constitution to lay
a "tax which remotely affects the efficient exercise of a
federal power" that it would be- difficult to see how it
could be contended that taxation of a patent or of the
avails of a patent in any way hampered the Federal Government in promoting science and the useful arts by the
process of exclusion (the only constitutional method
available to the Federal Government), were it not for
the dictum in McCulloch v. Maryland,4 Wheat. 316, and
for the decisions in the Oklahoma tax cases where the

- These causes present the question whethier the State of
Massachusetts may tax, as income, royalties received by
one of her citizens for the use of patents issued to him by
the United States. The Supreme Judicial Court of that
State held such an imposition would amount to a tax
upon the patent right itself and was prohibited by the
Federal Constitution. We agree with that conclusion.
The Constitution (Art. 1, Sec. 8) empowers Congress

exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;
The first Congress provided for issuance, in the

any term not exceeding fourteen years, the sole and exclusive right and liberty of paaking, constructing, using
and vending to others to be used, the said invention or
discovery

shall contain a short title or description of the invention
or discovery, correctly indicating its nature and design,
and a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for"the
term of seventeen years, of the exclusive right to make,
use and vend the said invention or discovery throughout
the United States and the Territories thereof, . .
Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court in Grant
v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218,, 241-242, stated the general purpose for which patents issue"To promote the progress of useful arts, is the interest
and policy of every enlightened government.
This subject was among the first which followed the organization of our government. It was taken up by the
first congress . .
The amendatory act of 1793 contains the same language, and it cannot be doubted that the
settled purpose of the United States has ever been, and
continues to be, to confer on the authors of useful inventions an exclusive right in their inventions for the time
mentioned in their patent. It is the reward stipulated for
the advantages derived by the public for the exertions
of the individual, and is intended as a stimulus to those
exertions. The laws which are passed to give effect to this
purpose ought, we think, to be construed in the spirit in
which they have been made. . . . The public yields

nothing which it has not agreed to yield; it receives all
which it has contracted to receive .
Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327-428-:"It is undeniably true; that the limited and .temporary
monopoly granted to inventors was never designed for
their exclusive profit or advantage; the benefit to:the public or comminity at large was another and dofibtless the
primary object in granting and securing that monopoly."
Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549-"The franchise which the patent grants, consists altogether in the right to exclude every one from making,
using, or vending the thing patented, without the permiission of the patentee. This-is all he obtains by the patent."
See also Paper Baig Patent case, 210 U. S. 405, 423;
Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell,229 U. S. 1,11.
The power to exclude others granted by the United
States to the patentee subserves a definite public purpose---to promote the progress bf science' and useful arts.
The patent is the instrument by which that end is to be
accomplished. It affords protection during the specified
period in 6onsideration of benefits conferred by the inventor. And the settled doctrine is that such instrumentalities may not be taxed by the States.
In Californiav. Pacific Railroad Co., 127, U. S. 1,, the
State sought to sustain a tax laid upon a franchise granted
by the United States; but its power therein was denied.
Through Mr. Justice Bradley this court said--"Recollecting the fundamental -principle that the- Constitution,
laws and treaties of the United States are the supreme

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES.

These are complaints brought by the respondent against
the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation of Massachusetts for the abatement of income taxes for the years
1921 and 1922. The question raised as stated by the Supreme Judicial Court of the State is whether the Commonwealth has the right to tax the income received from
royalties for the use of patents issued by the United
States. That Court held that the Commonwealth had
no such right under the Constitution of the United States

LONG v. ROCKWOOD.
142

HoLMES, BRAwms, SUTHEmAND;

and STONE, JJ., dissenting.

and the Commissioner obtained a writ of certiorari from
this Court.
The reasoning of the Court is simple. If the State
'cannot tax the patent, it cannot tax the royalties received from its use'. The postulate is founded on the
casual intimation of Chief Justice Marshall in McCluUoch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 432, and is said to have been
conceded below by the Commissioner. It hardly is conceded here and, whether it is or is not, if this Court should
be of opinion that the conclusion urged by the Commissioner can be supported upon broader grounds than he
felt at liberty to take, the Court is not estopped by his
doubts: Why then cannot a State tax a patent by a tax
that in no way discriminates against it? Obviously it is
not true that patents are instrumentalities of the Government. They are used. by the patentees for their private advantage alone. If the Government uses them it
must pay like other people. Richmond Screw Anchor Co.
v6 United States, 275 U. S. 331., The use made .by the
patentee may be not to make and sell, the patented article
but simply to keep other. people from doing so in aid of
some collateral interest of his own. Continental Paper
Bag Co.v. Eastern PaperBag Co., 210 U. S.405, 422, 424.
National banks really are instrumentalities of the Government and directly concern the national credit. Indians
are wards of the nation. Interstate commerce is left expressly to regulation by Congress and the States can intermeddle only by its consent. In this case the advantages expected by the Government are mainly the benefits
to the-public when the patent has expired and-secondarily
the encouragement of invention, Pennock v. Didlogue,
2 Peters, 1; 19. The most that can be said is that a tax
is a discouragement so far as it goes and to that extent
in its immediate operation runs counter to the Government intent. Butpatents would be yalueless. to their
owner without the organized societies constituted by the

States, and the question is why patents should not contribute as other property does tc maintaining that without which they would be of little use.
Most powers conceivably may be exercised beyond the
limits allowed by the law. Rights that even seem absolute have these qualifications. American Bank & Trust
Co. v. FederalReserve Bank of Atlanta, 256 U. S. 350, 358.
But we do not on that account resort to the blunt expedient of taking away altogether the power or the right.
Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., 198 U. S.
236, 247, 248. The power to tax is said to be the power
to destroy. But, to repeat what I just now have had occasion to say in another case, this Court, which so often
has defeated the attempt to tax in certain ways, can
defeat an attempt to discriminate or otherwise to go too
far without wholly abolishing the power to tax. The
power to fix rates is the power to destroy, but this Court
while it endeavors to prevent confiscation does not prevent the fixing of rates. Even with regard to patents
some laws of a kind, that might destroy the use of them
within the State have been upheld. Patterson v. Kentucky, 97 U. S. 501. Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344.
Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296. They must be reasonable or they will be held void, but if this Court deems
them reasonable they stand. Allen v. Riley, 203 U. S.
347, 355.
The fact that the franchise came from a grant by the
United States is no more reason for exemption, standing
by itself, than is the derivation of the title to a lot of
land from the same source. Tucker v. Ferguson,22 Wall.
527. In Baltimore Shipbuilding& Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore, 195 U. S. 375, the land was conveyed subject to a
condition that a dry-dock should be built upon it which
the United States was to have the right to use free from
charge for docking and which was to revert to the United
States on a diversion of the land to any other use or on

the dry-dock being unfit for use for six months. Certainly
a case in which the United States was much more clearly
interested than in an ordinary patent. Yet there it was
held that neither the company nor the land was an instrumentality of the United States and that there was
nothing to hinder the right of the State to tax. See
further Forbes v. Gracey,94 U. S. 762.
