2. Part of an operating property was taken over by a receiver in a
suit challenging the owner's title. Held, that the owner need not
report income as of the year when it was collected by the receiver,
while the right to it was in doubt, but must report it as income
of the year when the amount collected was paid over to him and
the bill dismissed. P. 423.

Argument for Respondent.

United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422; Lucas v. North
Texas Lumber Co., 281 U. S. 11.
The incident of the receivership should be disregarded.
The receiver was a mere arm of the court, invested with
no estate. Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243; Grant
v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 106 U. S. 429; Obispo Oil Co. v.
Welch, 48 F. (2d) 872, 875.
There was evidence that the accounts were kept and
the returns filed on the accrual basis. The burden, was
upon the Commissioner to prove the contrary. Brunton
v. Commissioner, 42 F. (2d) 81, 82.
If unconditional right to income, and not claim under
color of right, is at the foundation of the right to accrue,
then it would seem to follow that unconditional right
and not mere claim of right to income must exist to
render it taxable as cash income.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher, Miss Helen R. Cailoss, and
Messrs. Whitney North Seymour and Sewall Key were
on the brief, for respondent.
The receiver was not required to file an income tax
return for 1916 in behalf of the petitioner and to report
therein income impounded by him during that year. Cf.
Reinecke v. Gardner,277 U. S. 239, 241.
.Settled administrative construction of similar statutory
provisions relating to the filing of returns by receivers
and trustees in bankruptcy of corporations is entitled to
great weight.
There is no provision in the Acts for the consolidation
of fthe return of the. receiver of part of a corporation's
property or business and the return of. the corporation
itself. Forstmannv. Ferguson, 17 F. (2d) 659, 25 id. 47,

A taxpayer must report income which he has received under a claim of right, without restriction as to

'Had the taxpayer been on the accrual basis, the receipts

Mf. JUSTME BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.

The question for decision is whether the sum of $171,979.22 received by the North American Oil Consolidated
in 1917, was taxable to it as income of that year.
The money was paid to the company under the following circumstances. Among many properties operated
by it in 1916 was a section of oil land, the legal title to
which stood in the name of the United States. Prior to
that year, the Government, claiming also the beneficial

ownership, had instituted a suit to oust the company
from possession; and on February 2, 1916, it secured the
appointment of a receiver to operate the property, or
supervise its operations, and to hold the net income
thereof. The money paid to the company in 1917 represented the net profits which had been earned from that
property in 1916 during the receivership. The money
was paid to the receiver as earned. After entry by the
District Court in 1917 of the final decree dismissing the
bill, the money was paid,, in that year, by the receiver
to the company. United States v. North American Oil
Consolidated, 242 Fed. 723. The Government took an
appeal (without supersedeas) to the Circuit Court of
Appeals. In 1920, that Court affirmed the decree. 264
Fed. 336. In 1922, a further appeal to this Court was
dismissed by stipulation. 258 U. S. 633.
The income earned from the property in 1916 had been
entered on the books of the company as its income. It
had not been included in its original return of income for
1916; but it was included in an amended return for that
year which was filed in 1918. Upon auditing the company's income and profits tax returns for 1917, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined a deficiency
based on other items. The company appealed to the
Board of Tax Appeals. There, in 1927 the Commissioner
prayed that the deficiency already claimed should be increased so as to include a tax on the amount paid by the
receiver to the company in 1917. The Board held that
the profits were taxable to the receiver as income of 1916;
and hence made no finding whether the company's accounts were kept on the cash receipts and disbursements
basis or on the accrual basis. 12 B. T. A. 68. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that Ihe profits were taxable
to the company as income of 1917, regardless of whether
th company's returns Were made on the cash or on the

accrual basis. 50 F. (2d) 752. This Court granted a
writ of certiorari. 284 U. S. 6i4.
It is conceded that the net profits earned by the proper y during the receivership constituted income. The
:company contends that they should have been reported
by the receiver for taxation in 1916; that if not returnable
by him, they should have been returned by the company
for 1916, because they constitute income of the company
accrued in that year; and that if not taxable as income
of the company for 1916, they were taxable to it as income for 1922, since the litigation was not finally terminated in its favor until 1922.
First. The income earned in 1916 and impounded by
the receiver in that year was not taxable to him, because
he, was the receiver of only a part of the properties
operated by the company. Under ยง 13 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1916,1 receivers who "are operating the property or business of corporations" were obliged to make
returns "of net income as and for such corporations,"
and "any income tax due" was to be "assessed and
collected in the same manner as if assessed directly
:against the organization of whose business or properties
they have custody and control." The phraseology of this
section was adopted without change in the Revenue Act
of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1081, c. 18, ยง 239. The regulations
of the Treasury Department have consistently construed
'Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 771, c. .463: "In cases
wherein receivers, trustees in bankruptcy, or assignees are operating
the property or business of corporations . . . . subject to tax imposed
by this title, such receivers, trustees, or assignees shall make returns
of net income as and for such corporations . . . , in the same manner
and form as such organizations are hereinbefore required to 'make
returns, and any income tax due on the basis of such returns made
by receivers, trustees, or assignees shall be assessed and collected in
the same manner as if assessed directly against the organizations of
whose business or properties they have custody and control."

NORTH AMERICAN OIL v. BURNET.

Opinion of the Court.

these statutes as applying only to receivers in charge of
the entire property or business of a corporation; and in
all other cases have required the corporations themselves
to report their income. Treas. Regs. 33, arts. 26, 209;
Treas. Regs. 45, arts. 424, 622. That construction is
clearly correct. The language of the section contemplates
a substitution of the receiver for the corporation; and
there can be such substitution only when the receiver is in
complete control of the properties and business of the
corporation. Moreover, there is no provision for the
consolidation of the return of a receiver of part of a corporation's property or business with the return of the corporation itself. It may not be assumed that Congress
intended to require the filing of two separate returns for
the same year, each covering only a part of the corporate
income, without making provision for consolidation so
that the tax could be based upon the income as a whole.
Second. The net profits were not taxable to the company as income of 1916. For the company was not required in 1916 to report as income an amount which it
might never receive. See Burnet v. Logan, 283 U. S. 404,
413. Compare Lucas v. American Code Co., 280 U. S. 445,
452; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359, 363.
There was no constructive receipt of the profits by the
company in that year, because at no time during the'
year was there a right in the company to demand that
the receiver pay over the money. Throughout 1916 it
was uncertain who would be declared entitled to the
profits. It was not until 1917, when the District Court
entered a final decree vacating the receivership and dismissing the bill, that the company became entitled to
receive the money. Nor is it material, for the purposes
of this case, whether the company's return was filed on
the cash receipts and disbursements basis, or on the accrual basis. In neither event was it taxable in 1916 on

account of income which it had not yet received and which
it might never receive.
Third. The net profits earned by the property in 1916
were not income of the year 1922-the year in which the
litigation with the Government was finally terminated,
They became income of the company in 1917, when it
first became entitled to them and when it actually received them. If a taxpayer receives earnings under a
claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition,
he has received income which he is required to return,
even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled
to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent. See Board v.
Commissioner, 51 F. (2d) 73, 75, 70. Compare United
States v. S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co., 274 U. S. 398, 403.
If in 1922 the Government had prevailed, and the company had been obliged to refund the profits received in
1917, it would have been entitled to a deduction from
the profits of 1922, not from those of any earlier year.
