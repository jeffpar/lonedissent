GENERAL IMPORT & EXPORT CO., INC. v.
UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 811.

Argued April 15, 1932.-Decided May 2, 1932.

A vessel seized in territorial waters while carrying an unmanifested
cargo of intoxicating liquors may be libeled under.the Tariff Act
pf 1922,. §§ 584 and 594, (19 U. S. C., §§ 486, 498) to enforce the
money penalties thereby imposed upon the master and charged
upon the vessel for his misconduct in not producing a manifest and
in carrying cargo not described in a manifest. Section 26 of the
National Prohibition Act does not prevent. General Motors
Acceptance Corp. v. United States; ante, p. 49; United States v.
The Ruth Mildred, ante, p. 67. P. 73.
56 F. (2d) 590, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 285 U. S. 534, to review the reversal of a
decree, 47 F. (2d) 336, dismissing a libel to enforce liens
on a vessel.

Mr. Milton R. Kroopf, with whom Mr. Louis Halle
was on the brief, for petitioner.
Section 26, Title II, of the National Prohibition Act
is the exclusive statute under which the United States
may proceed against the vessel. Richbourg Motor Co. v.
United States, 281 U. S. 528.'
Paragraph 813 of Schedule 8 does not refer to intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, or if it does, it can

only refer to such as may be imported consistently with
the Prohibition Act. It can not afford a basis for invoking §§ 584 and 594 of the Tariff Act of 1922..
In the presence of the specific legislation in the Tariff
Act.as to what merchandiseis prohibited, it is significant
that intoxicating liquor fu: beverage purposes is nowhere
included. Nor does it include" those articles and liquors

GENERAL IMPORT CO. v. U. S.

Argument for the United States.

which are enumerated in Schedule 8, for obviously that
schedule refers to merchandise capable of importation.
Paragraph 813 of Schedule 8, being part of the Tariff
Act, could not recognize the importation of intoxicating,
liquors for beverage purposes contrary to the Eighteenth
Amendment. United States v. Katz, 271 U. S. 354.

The master of a vessel actually within the territorial
limits of the United States, and on which intoxicating
liquors- are being imported, is amenable to prosecution
under the National Prohibition Act; the vessel subject
to seizure under § 26 of the National Prohibition Act;
and the cargo forfeitable by virtue of Paragraph 813 of
Schedule 8.
Strictly speaking, § 26 of the Prohibition Act is not a
forfeiture statute. It does not declare forfeit the res although all the proceedings under it are directed to' that
end. The vehicle is ordered sold, but the rights of innocent
lienors and owners are saved. Only to the extent of guilty
interests is the res penalized. Nor is the guilt of the person in charge transferable to the res. In such respect,
§ 26 is a penalty statute in the same sense as the Tariff
Act, § 594, with the obvious and vital difference that innocence provides a defense.
The court below in United States v. One Mack Truck,
4 F. (2d) 923, reached a conclusion irreconcilable with the
one in this case.
The weight of authority is with the District Court.
United States v. One Ford Coupe, 43 F. (2d) 212; United
States v. One Studebaker, 45 F. (2d) 430; Colon v. Hanlon, 50 F. (2d) 353; Corriveauv. United.States, 53 F. (2d)

735. See also United States v. Ryan, 284 U. S. 167.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

There is no direct conflict between a forfeiture statute
and a penalty statute. The two are different in theory
and distinguishable in effect. It would be carrying the
doctrine of implied repeal beyond reasonable bounds to
hold that two statutes so essentially different could be in
direct conflict. It is only by accident in this case that
the penalty was so great as to exhaust the entire value of
the vessel and result in her forfeiture.
In forfeiture proceedings the law operates upon the title
to the property. In a penalty suit the property is merely
security to insure the payment of a money penalty.
Evidence necessary to support the one proceeding is
essentially different from that required in the other. Because of these differences a conflict can not exist. Carter
v. McClaughry, 183 U. S. 365; Burton v. United States,
202 U. S. 344; Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338;
Morgan v. Devine, 237 U. S. 632.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
. The steamship "Sebastopol" was seized by Coast
Guard Officers in the harbor of New York while carrying
an unmanifested cargo of intoxicating liquors. The master of the vessel did not produce a manifest for the cargo
when a manifest was demanded by the boarding officer.
Thereafter a libel of information was filed by the Government under §§, 584 and 594 of the Tariff Act of 1922
(Act of Sept. 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 980, 982; 19
U. S. C., §§ 486, 498) for the enforcement of two liens,
one of $500 for failing to produce a manifest and another
for-an amount equal to'the value of the cargo for having
on board merchandise not described in the manifest.
The District Court dismissed the libel on the ground
that § 26 of the National Prohibition Act had established
a system of forfeiture exclusive of any other. 47 F. (2d)
336. The Circuit Court of Appeals advanced the view

NIXON v. CONDON.

Syllabus.

that the suit was not strictly one for the forfeiture of the
vessel, but one for the enforcement of money penalties
charged upon the vessel by reason of the misconduct of
the master. On this ground it distinguished its own decision in the case of the Ruth Mildred, announced at the
same time, and gave judgment for the Government.
For that reason as well as for the broader reasons stated
in General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. United- States,
ante, p. 49, and United States v. The Ruth Mildred, ante,
p. 67, the decree will be affirmed.
Affirmed.

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 265.

Argued January 7, 1932. Reargued March 15, 1932.Decided May 2, 1932.

A statute of Texas provided: " every political party in the State
through its State Executive Committee shall have the power to
prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its
own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party . . ." Acting under this statute,
and not under any authorization from the convention of their party,
the Executive Committee of the Democratc Party in Texas adopted
a resolution that only white Democrats should participate in the
primary elections, thereby excluding negroes. Held:
1. Whatever inherent power a state political party has to determine the qualifications of its members resides in the party convention and not in any committee. P. 84.
2. The power exercised by, the Executive Committee in this
instance was not the power of the party as a voluntary organization but came from the statute. P. 85.
3. The committee's action was therefore state action within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 88.
4. The resulting discrimination violates that Amendment. P 89.
5. Whether in given circumstances parties or their committees
are agencies of government within the Fourteenth or the Fifteenth
