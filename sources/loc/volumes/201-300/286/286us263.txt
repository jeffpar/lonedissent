MACDONALD v. PLYMOUTH TRUST CO. 263
254

Statement of the Case.

Such a procedure, if actually carried out, might afford a
basis, which is lacking here, for the inference that re,spondent, no longer content with 'the r6le of creditor, had
sought to establish a trust fund. But the mere debiting
of his account, without more, for the reimbursement of
the bank for the obligation which it was supposed to have
incurred or paid, lends no support to such an inference.
The cancellation of the credit balance by the debit neither
suggests any intention to establish a trust nor points to
any identifiable thing which could be the subject of it.The debit entry may be disregarded, because respondent's assent to it was procured by a false statement; but
the only consequence is that his status as a creditor is
unaffected and he is entitled only to share in the funds
of the bank on an equal footing'with other creditors who
similarly are the victims of its insolvency.
Reversed.

and where the referee is not to be included, "court of
bankruptcy" is alwayg used. See H 2, 12 (b), 21 (a) and

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
In a bankruptcy proceeding pending in' the Di~trict
Court for Massachusetts, the trustee in bankruptcy, the
petitioner here, filed a petition with the referee to set
aside certain alleged transfers of property by the bankrupt to the respondent as voidable preferences within the

Opinion of the Court.

provisions of § 60 (b) of the Bankruptcy.Act. The re-,
spondent appeared in the proceeding, denied the mate,rial allegations of the petition, but consented in open
court that the trial of the issues proceed'before the referee.
The referee made an order,wbased on findings, granting
in part the relief prayed. The District Court, on cross
'petitions to review the determination of the referee, modified his order in respects not now material. 46 F. (2d)
811. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
reversed the order of the District Court, holding that as
the issues before the referee were determinable only in a
plenary suit, the referee, notwithstanding the 'consent of
the parties, was without jurisdiction to decide them.
53 F. (2d) 827. This Court granted certiorari, to resolve
a conflict of the decision below with that in In re Hopkins
(C. C. A. 2d), 229 Fed. 378:; see also Arkansas Natural
Gas Corp. v. Page, 53 F. (2d) 27; American Finance Co.
v. Coppard (C. C. A. 5th), 45 F. (2d) 154; Board of Education v. Leary (C. C. A. 8th), 236 Fed. 521; Gamble v.
Daniel (C. C. A. 8th), 39 F. (2d) 447, appeal. dismissed,
,281 U. S. 705.
The only. question, presented 'by the petition, which
need be considered. here,. is whether, the issues raised being such as were triable in a plenary suit, the referee, the
parties -consenting,; had jurisdiction to determine them,
Under the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Act,
the District Court below had jurisdiction to hear and determine the present 'suit. Section 60- (b). of the Bankruptcy Act confers on trustees in bankruptcy authority
to maintain plenary suits to set aside voidable preferences
as defined in that section. Section 23 (b), as originally
enacted, provided,," Suits by the trustee shall only be
brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt,
whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might
have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the

proposed defendant." An amendment of this section in
1903 removed its restrictions on suits brought under § 60
(b) by adding the words "except suits for the recovery of
property under section sixty, subdivision b; . .." At
the same time § 60 (b) was amended, so as to confer jurisdiction over suits by the trustee to set aside voidable preferences in- "any court of bankruptcy." By § 1 (8)
"courts of bankruptcy" includes District Courts.
Jurisdiction over the present suit being thus vested in
the -District Court as a court of bankruptcy, the question
with which we are immediately concerned is whether the
referee appointed by the District Court where the bankrupt's estate is being administered, is a court within the
meaning of § 23 (b), and is included in the phrase "any
court- of bankruptcy" in § 60 (b), and hence is vested
with such jurisdiction that, the defendant consenting, he
may try and determine the issues in the suit.
That he may not try such issues without the consent of
the defendant has been often and uniformly held. Louisville Trust Co. v. Camingor, 184 U. S. 18, 26; Babbitt v.
Dutcher,216 U. S. 102, 113; Weidhorn.v. Levy, 253 U. S.
268, 273; Harrisonv. Chamberlin,271 U. S.191, 193; see
also Daniel v.. Guaranty Trust Co., 285 U. S. 154. In
cases where the defendant made timely objection to a determination by the referee, it has been said that the referee
is without power to hear the issues involved in a plenary
suit, and that such a suit, if brought before him, must
be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. See Weidhorn v.
Levy, supra.,
But a distinction is to be noted between the power of
the referee to decide the issues in such a suit brought
before him without objection, and his power to compel the
litigation of them before him, over the objection of the
proposed defendant. Where a suit by the trustee is
plenary in character, as are those authorized by § 60 (b),
both parties to it are entitled to claim the benefits of the

MACDONALD v. PLYMOUTH TRUST CO-_ 267

Opinion of the Court.

procedure in. a plenarysuit, not available in the summary
method of procedure which, under the provisions of the
,Bankruptcy Act, is employed by the referee. A denial of
those benefits would be in effect a denial of the right to
a plenary suit, to which both parties are entitled under
§ 60 (b). But it does not follow that this privilege, extended for the benefit of a suitor, may not, like the right
to trial by jury, be waived, see Harrisonv. Chamberlin,
supra; cf. Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, and,
being waived, that the referee is without the power given
to courts of bankruptcy to decide the issues.
This Court has intimated, although it has - never decided, that the referee may, if the parties consent, try the
issues which must otherwise be tried in, a plenary suit
brought by the trustee. See Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co.
v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 431, 433, 434; Harrisonv. Chamberlin, supra. See also, Foster.v. Manufacturers' Finance
Co., 22 F. (2d) 609. And we can perceive no reason why
the privilege of claiming the benefits of the procedure in
a plenary suit, secured to suitors under § 60 (b) and § 23
(b), may not be waived by consent, as any other proceAural privilege of the suitor may be waived, and a more
summary procedure substituted. Cf. Chicago, B. & Q.
Ry. Co. v. Willard, 220 U. S. 413, 419-421.
But the question remains, whether, the privilege of
trial by plenary suit being waived, the referee possesses
the power which courts of bankruptcy possess to hear and
determine the issues presented. Section 23 (b), before
its amendment, contemplated that the restrictions upon
the choice of a court for the maintenance of suits by the
trustee should be removed by consent of the proposed defendant. That is still its effect with respect tb suits not
enumerated in the amendment. Section 1 (7) provides
that "'court' shall mean the court of bankruptcy in
which the proceedings are pending, and may include the
referee." By the two sections read together, the District

268

286 U.S.

Court in which the proceeding is pending is designated
as a court where the trustee may bring the suit if consented to, and that court "may include the referee," to
whom it has referred the proceeding.
.Whether "courts" in § 23 (b), should be taken to include the referee, as § 1 (7) permits, is to be determined
in view of the fact that under § 23 (b), as originally enacted, and in many instances since its amendment, the
jurisdiction, either of court or referee, may be invoked
only on consent, and that in any case plenary suits may
not be summarily tried by the referee without consent.
Section 38 (a) (4) contemplates that referees within
their districts may be invested with the powers of courts
of bankruptcy except as to-questions relating .to the dis,charge of the bankrupt, and General Order XII directs
that after the appointment of the referee all proceedings
shall be had before him except such' as are -specifically
required to be had before the judge. These provisions,
read in the light of the object sought to be attained by
the Bankruptcy Act, and more particularly by § 23 (b)
and §,60 (b) as amended, lead to the conclusion that the
word "courts" as used in § 23 (b) and the words "any
court of bankruptcy" in § 60 (b) must be taken to include the referee and vest in him the power possessed by
courts of bankruptcy under §§ 23 (b) and 60 (b), to decide the issues in a suit brought under § 60 (b), where
the parties join in presenting them to hinm for determination. .While under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act
the exercise of his jurisdiction by, the referee is ordinarily
restricted to those matters which may be dealt with summarily by the method of procedure available to referees.
in b&thkruptcy, the restriction may be remoied, as it'was
here, by the consent of the parties to a summary trial of
the issue presented. The referee therefore had power
to decide the issues, and the Court of Appeals below
should have considered the appeal on its merits.
