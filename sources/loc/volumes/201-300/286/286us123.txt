dence or findings pursuant to a written stipulation between the Government and the defendants expressly providing that "this stipulation shall not constitute or be
considered as an admission, and the rendition or entry
of the decree, or the decree itself, shall not constitute-or
be considered as an adjudication that the defendants, or
any of them, have in fact violated any law of the United
States." And that provision was in exact words incorporated in and made a part of the decree. Thus the Government consented to, and the court adopted, this provision
quite as much as the defendants consented to the other
parts of the decree.
The fact that defendants thereafter applied to have the
decree vacated upon grounds directed only to the power
of the court to enter it ought not to be regarded as militating against them or their good faith-particularly when
it is recalled that this court, when reviewing that proceeding, deemed the questions presented of sufficient importance to call for their argument a second time. 276

I am authorized to say that MR.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 118. Argued January 12, 1932. Reargued March 15, 16, 1932.Decided May 16, 1932.
1. A privilege tax on a business of licensing copyrighted motion pictures, measured by the gross receipts of royalties, is in effect a
direct charge upon the royalties. EducationalFilms Corp. v. Ward,
282 U. S. 379, distinguished. P. 126.

Argument for Appellant.

2. Copyrights, as granted under the Copyright Act, are the property
of the author, in which the United States has no interest aside from
the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of
authors. P. i27.
"3.Copyrights are not federal instrumentalities and income derived
from them is not immune from state taxation. Long v. Rockwood,
277 U. S. 142, (holding otherwise as to patents) is overruled.
Pp. 128, 131.
โข4. The principle of immunity of federal instrumentalities from state
taxation and of state instrumentalities from federal taxation is confined to the protection of operations of government. P. 128.5. The mere fact that a copyright is property derived from a grant
by the United States is insufficient to support the claim of exemption. Nor does the fact that the grant is made in furtherance of
a governmental policy of the United States, and because of the
benefits which are deemed to accrue to the public in the execution
of that policy, furnish ground for immunity. P. 128.
6. A nondiscriminatory tax on the royalties from copyrights does not
hamper the execution of the policy of the copyright statute. P. 131.
173 Ga. 403, affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment, by a divided court, sustaining
the dismissal of a suit to enjoin collection of state taxes.
Messrs. Wm.A. Sutherland and Joseph B. Brennan,
with whom Mr. Benjamin P. DeWitt was on the brief,
for appellant.
Copyrights granted by the United States are federal
instrumentalities and the royalties derived therefrom are
not taxable by the States. Long v. Rockwood, 277 U. S.
142; followed in Quicksafe Mfg. Corp. v. Graham, 161
Tenn. 46; Maxwell v. Chemical Const. Co., 200 N. C. 500.
There is no basis for drawing any distinction between
patents and copyrights in the present connection. Copyright and patent powers are conferred upon Congress by
the Constitution in exactly the same language.
In Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379,
it was not suggested that copyrights are to be treated
differently from patents with regard to state taxation.
See Long v. Rockwood, 41 F. (2d) 395, 396.

Argument for Appellant.

A State may not tax income from federal instrumentalities under an occupation or privilege tax measured by
gross receipts. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Wisconsin, 275 U. S. 136, 140; Crew Levick Co. V..Pennsylvania, 245 U. S. 292; New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State
Board, 280 U. S. 338.
A distinction should be drawn here between an excise
tax which is measured by gross receipts and one which is
measured by net receipts from a federal instrumentality.
This Court has -held that royalties from United States
copyrights may be included in the net income which is
-the measure of the New York Corporate Franchise Tax.
EducationalFilms Corp. v. Ward, supra. In that case it
was following Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 162
et seq., which upheld a federal tax levied upon a corporate
franchise, and measured by the entire corporate net income, including income from tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Cf. Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S. 620, 635.
It should be noticed that both the Educational Films
Corp. case and Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., involved corporate franchise taxes, rather than gbneral occupation
taxes such as the Georgia Gross Receipts tax. In upholding the tax in the EducationalFilms Corp. case, the three
judge district court distinguished the case of Panhandle
Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S. 218, on the ground that
the privilege tax held void in that case was not a corporate franchise tax. Educational Films Corp. v. Ward,
41 F. (2d) 395, 397. Cf. National Life Ins. Co. v. United
States, 277 U. S. 508.At least royalties from copyrights are no less immune
from state taxation than receipts from interstate commerce, and it is clear that receipts from interstate commerce can not validly be taxed under the Georgia Gross
Receipts Tax Act. Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 275 U. S. 501;
,Fargo v. Michigan, 121 U. S. 230; Philadelphia& Sou.

Mr. Orville A. Park, with whom Messrs. George M.
Napier, Attorney General of Georgia, and J. A. Smith
were on the brief, for appellees.
.MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Appellant, a New York corporation which is engaged
within the State of Georgia in the business of licensing
copyrighted motion pictures, brought this suit to restrain
the collection of the state tax upon the gross receipts of
royalties under such licenses. The tax was challenged
upon the ground that copyrights are instrumentalities of
the United States. On demurrer, the suit was dismissed,
and the Supreme Court of the State, the Justices being
equally divided in opinion, affirmed the judgment. 172
Ga. 403; 157 S. E. 664. The case comes here on appeal.
The Gross Receipts Tax Act (Georgia Laws, 1929, p.
103), describes the tax as laid "upon the privilege of engaging in certain occupations" and "upon certain business and comnfiercial transactions and enterprises." As
the tax is measured by gross receipts, the case is not ruled
by EducationalFilms Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379, where
the tax was based upon the net income of the corporation. Appellant insists, and we think rightly, that the
operation of the statute here in question, in its application to gross receipts, is to impose a direct charge upon
the royalties. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, 275 U. S. 136, 141. , See, also, Crew Levick Co. v.
Pennsylvania,245 U. S. 292, 297; United States Glue Co.
v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328, 329; New Jersey Bell
Telephone Co. v. State Board, 280 U. S. 338, 346. The
question is thus presented whether copyrights are to be

FOX FILM. CORP. v. DOYAL.
123

Opinion of the Court.

deemed instrumentalities of the Federal Government and
hence immune from state taxation.
The Constitution empowers the Congress "To promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
limited Times to Author's and Inventors the exclusive
Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Art.
I, ยง 8, par. 8. The production to which the protection of
copyright may be accorded is the property of the author
and not of the United States. But the copyright is the
creature of the Federal statute passed in the exercise of
the power vested in the Congress. As this Court has
repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing
right but created a new one. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet.
591, 661; American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U. S.
284, 291; Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker, 210 U. S. 356,
362; Caliga v. Inter Ocean Newspaper Co., 215 U. S. 182,
188. The statute confers upon the author after publication the exclusive right for a limited period to multiply
and vend copies and to engage in the other activities described by the 'statute in relation to the subject matter.
U. S. C., Tit. 17. In creating this right, the Congress did
not reserve to the United States any interest in the production itself, or in the copyright, or in the profits that
may be derived from its use. Nor did the Congress provide that the right, or the gains from .its exercise, should
be free of tax. The owner of the copyright, if he pleases,
may refrain from vending or licensing and content himself with simply exercising the right to exclude others
from using his property. Compare Continental Paper
Bag Co. v. Eastern PaperBag Co., 210 U. S.405, 422, 424.
The sole interest of the United States and the primary
object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors. A
copyright, like a patent, is "at once the equivalent given
by the public for benefits bestowed by the genius and
meditations and skill of individuals and the incentive to

further efforts for the same important objects." Kendall
v. Winsor, 21 How. 322,- 327, 328; Grant v. Raymond, 6
Pet. 218, 241, 242.
The :principle of the immunity from state taxation of
instrumentalities of the Federal Government, and of the
corresponding immunity of state instrumentalities from
Federal taxation--essential to the maintenance of our
dual system-has its inherent limitations. It is aimed
,at the protection of the operations of government (McCullOch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436), and the immunity does not extend "to anything lying outside or beyond governmental functions and their exertions." Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 570, 576,
579. Where the immunity exists, it is absolute, resting
upon an "entire absence of power" (Johnson v. Maryland, 254 U. S.51, 55, 56), but it does not exist "where
no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence
upon the exercise of the functions of government." Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S.216, 225.
In this instance, the mere fact that a copyright is property derived from a grant by the United States is insufficient to support the claim of exemption. Nor does the
fact that the grant is made in furtherance of a governmental policy of the United States, and because of the
benefits which are deemed to accrue to the public in the
execution of that policy, furnish ground for immunity.
The disposition by the Government of public lands, in
order to advance the general interest by promoting settlement, illustrates the principle and its limitation. The
property of the United States is not subject to state taxa,tion (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 11T U. S. 151), but the
property of individual owners, although derived from the
United States under its public land laws, may be taxed.
The power to tax exists as soon as the ownership is
changed. Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 219.

Opinion of the Court.

Though the legal title remains in the Government, if the
proceedings have reached the point where nothing more.
remains to be done by the entryman and the Government
no longer has any beneficial interest in the land and does
not exclude the entryman from the use of it, he is regarded
as the beneficial owner and the land as subject to taxation.
Bothwell v. Bingham County, 237 U. S. 642, 647.1. Again,
the possessory right of a qualified locator after discovery
of minerals is a property right in the full sense, tfnaffected
by the fact that the paramount title to the land is in the
United States, and such interest from early times has been
held to be vendible, inheritable, and taxable. Forbes v.
Gracey, 94 U. S. 762, 766, 767; Elder v. Wood, 208 U. S.
226, 232; Union Oil Co. v. Smith, 249 U. S. 337, 349;
Irwin v. Wright, 258 U. S. 219, 231.' It is thus apparent
that the mere fact that a property right is created by sttute to fulfil a governmental purpose does not make it
nontaxable when it is held in private ownership and exercised for private advantage. See Susquehanna Power Co,
v. State Tax Commission (No. 1), 283 U. S. 291, 297.
'See, also, Carroll v. Safford, 3 How. 441, 461; Tucker v. Ferguson,
22 Wall. 527, 572; Wisconsin Railroad Co. v. Price -County, 133 U. S.
496, 505; Irwin v. Wright, 258 U. S. 219, 228, 229; New Brunswick
v. United States, 276 U. S. 547, 556; Exchange Trust Co. v. Drainage
District, 278 U. S.421, 425; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S.
279, 282..
'Even the reservation to the United States, in its grant of property, of a right of user for particular governmental purposes does not
necessarily withdraw the property granted from the taxing power of
the State. Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, 195 UI. S. 375.
Property in private ownership is not rendered non-taxable by the
mere fact that it is the property of an-agent of the Government and
is used in the conduct of the agent's operations and is necessary for
the agency, when Congress has not provided for its exemption. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 33; Central.Pacific R. Co. v. California, 162 U. S. 91, 125; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., .224

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286U.S.

We are of the opinion that no controlling distinction
can be based,. in the case of copyrights, upon the character
of the right granted. The argument that it is in the
nature of a franchise or privilege bestowed by the Government, is met by the fact that it is not a franchise or
privilege to be exercised on behalf of the Government or
in performing a function of the Government. The 'mining claim' above mentioned, or the possessory right to
.explore and work a mine under the applicable Federal
laws and regulations, may also be regarded as a franchise
or privilege, but the Court found the right to be none the
less taxable,. observing in Forbes v. Gracey, supra, that
",those claims are the subject of bargain and sale and
constitute very largely the wealth of the Pacific coast
States." Copyright is a right exercised by the owner during the term at his pleasure and exclusively for his own
profit and forms the basis for extensive and profitable
business enterprises. The advantage to. the public is
gained merely from the carrying out of the general policy
in making such grants and not from any direct interest
which the Government has in the use of the property
which is the subject of the grants. After the copyright
has been granted the Government has no interest in any
action under it save the general one that its laws shall be
obeyed. Operations of the owner in multiplying copies,
in sales, in performances or exhibitions, or in licensing
others for such purposes, are manifestly not the operations
of the Government. A tax upon the gains derived from
such operations is not a tax upon the exertion of any
governmental function.
In Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, the question
.concerned income derived from leases of restricted Indian
lands. 'The leases were deemed to be instrumentalities of
the United States in carrying out its duties to the Indians,
and the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, concluded that the tax imposed by Oklahoma was "a direct

McCORMICK & CO. v. BROWN.

Syllabus.

hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the
best terms that it can for its wards." Id., p. 506. A similar result was reached in the recent ruling in relation to
what was deemed to be the correlative case of leases by
Oklahoma of lands held by the State for the support of
its schools. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Company,
285 U. S. 393. These decisions are not controlling here.
The nature and purpose of copyrights place them in a
distinct category and we are unable to find any basis for
the supposition that a nondiscriminatory tax on royalties
hampers in the slightest degree the execution of the policy
of the copyright statute.
.We agree, however, with the contention that in this
aspect royalties from copyrights stand in the same position
as royalties from the use of patent rights, and what we
have said as to the purposes of the Government in relation to copyrights applies as well, mutatis mutandis, to
patents which are granted under the same constitutional
authority to promote the progress of science and useful
arts. The affirmance of the judgment in the instant case
cannot be reconciled with the decision in Long v. Rockwood, 277 U. S. 142, upon which appellant relies, and in
view of the conclusions now reached upon a re-examination of the question, that case is definitely overruled.
Judgment affirmed.
