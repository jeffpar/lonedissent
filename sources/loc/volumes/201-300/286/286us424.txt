account of income which it had not yet received and which
it might never receive.
Third. The net profits earned by the property in 1916
were not income of the year 1922-the year in which the
litigation with the Government was finally terminated,
They became income of the company in 1917, when it
first became entitled to them and when it actually received them. If a taxpayer receives earnings under a
claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition,
he has received income which he is required to return,
even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled
to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent. See Board v.
Commissioner, 51 F. (2d) 73, 75, 70. Compare United
States v. S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co., 274 U. S. 398, 403.
If in 1922 the Government had prevailed, and the company had been obliged to refund the profits received in
1917, it would have been entitled to a deduction from
the profits of 1922, not from those of any earlier year.

Argued April 26, 27, 1932.-Decided May 23, 1932.

1. in computing the federal estate tax under the Revenue Act of
1916, state succession taxes (distinguished from transfer taxes), are
not deductible from the gross estate. Leach v. Nichols, 285 U. S.

UNITED STATES v. KOMBST.
424

Opinion of the Court.

CERTIORARI, 285 U. S. 532, to review a judgment allowing a claim to recover part of an amount exacted as a federal estate tax.

Assistant Attorney General Rugg, with whom Solicitor
General Thacher, and Messrs. Whitney North Seymour
and H. Brian Holland were on the brief, for the United
States.
Mr. Frederick Schwertner, with whom Mr. Clarence
W. DeKnight was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question for decision is whether the sum of,$261,811.42 paid to the State of California for inheritance taxes
should have been deducted from the gross estate of the
decedent before calculating the federal estate tax under
the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended.
On April 25, 1917, Rosa von Zimm~ermann died in California, a German alien enemy, leaving a net estate valued
at $1,927,610.88. Her will was probated there. Her
executors, who were citizens of that State, paid in 1918
to the United States an estate tax of $144,889.78, and to
California for inheritance taxes the sum of $261,811.42.
In the same year, the Alien Property Custodian served
notice and demand upon the executors to convey and pay
over to him all interest, in the estate, of the residuary
legatees, who were likewise German alien enemies. In
1922, the executors, having rendered a final account and
turned over the residue of the estate to the Alien Property Custodian, were discharged. After March 4, 1923, the
effective date of the Winslow Act, 42 Stat. 1511, c. 285,
a claim for refund was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by Barnim Kombst and the other resid-

uary legatees. One of the grounds assigned was that the
sum paid to California by way of an inheritance tax'
should have been deducted from the gross estate before
calculating the federal estate tax. Subsequently, the
'Alien Property Custodian filed a like claim. The Commissioner rejected both claims. Thereupon, the legatees
and the Alien Property Custodian brought this action
in the Court ,of Claims to recover the amount alleged to
have been wrongfully exacted. The*court sustained their
contention, and allowed recovery of $23,563.03, with interest. 52 F. (2d) 1030. Certiorari was granted, 285
U. S. 532. The Government contends that the sum paid
to California was not deductible; and that even if it
should have been deducted, there can be no recovery, because the claim for refund was not made within the
period allowed by law.
The Revenue Act of 1916, ยง 203 (a) 1, under which the
excise tax is laid, does not allow as a deduction from the
gross estate a sum paid by way of succession tax, as distinguished from an estate tax.' Leach v. Nichols, 285
U. S. 165; New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345,
350. Compare United States v. Woodward, 256 U. S.
632, 635. Whether the California tax was a succession
tax or an estate tax is to be determined by reference to
the decisions of its highest court. Leach v. Nichols,
supra; Keith v. Johnson, 271 U. S. 1, 8. The California
tax was levied under the Inheritance Tax Act of 1913,
'Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 778, c. 463: "See. 203.
That for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be
determined"(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from
the value of the
gross estate"(1) Such amounts for funeral expenses, administration expenses,
claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages . . . and such other
charges against the estate, as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction . . . under which the estate is being administered. .. ."

from its predecessors, Cal. Stats. 1905, p. 341, and Cal.
States. 1911, p. 713, which have uniformly been held by
the Supreme Court of the State to impose a tax upon the
succession. Estate of Kennedy, 157 Cal. 517, 523; 108

of Letchworth, 201 Cal. 1; 255 Pac. 195. See Stebbins v.
Riley, 268 U. S. 137, 144.
It is urged that the original and all later California
inheritance tax acts were patterned after the New York
Act; and that, under the New York.Act, the tax is one
upon the transfer. Keith v. Johnson, 271 U. S. 1. Compare United States v. Mitchell, 271 U. S. 9. As the highest
court of California has construed its statutes as laying
a succession tax, we have no occasion to consider the construction given by the courts of New York to its legislation. Compare Stonebraker v. Hunter, 215 Fed. 67, 69.
The Commissioner properly refused to allow as a deduction the amount paid to the State. We have, therefore,
no occasion to consider the question whether the claim
for refund was filed in time.
