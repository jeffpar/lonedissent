FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 423.

Argued February 15, 16, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

1. A state statute is a "public act" within the meaning of the full
faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution. P. 154.
2. A federal court is bound equally with courts of the State in which
it sits to observe the command of the full faith and credit clause.

under the Act is the cause of action sued on, and where it is set
up merely as a defense to an asserted liability. P. 160.
4. Through a contract made in Vermont, an employer domiciled and
having its principal place of business there, and its employee, also
a resident of that State, tacitly accepted the Vermont Workmen's
Compensation Act, which provides that injury or death of In employee suffered in Vermont or elsewhere in the course of his employment, shall be compensated for only as by the Act provided,
without recourse to actions based on tort, which it expressly
excludes. The employee died of an injury he received while casually in New Hampshire about the employment, and left no New
Hampshire dependents. Held:
(1) That the Vermont statutory agreement is a defense to the
employer against an action for death-by wrongful act, brought in
New Hampshire, in the federal court, by the personal representative
of the deceased employee. P.153.
(2) Refusal to recognize such defense is a failure to give full
faith and credit to the Vermont statute, in violation of Art. IV,
§1, of the Federal Constitution. P. 154.
(3) To recognize as a defense in another State the statutory
relationship and obligations to which the parties to the employment subjected themselves under the Vermont Act, is not to give
that Act an extraterritorial application. P. 155.
(4) The fact that the New Hampshire Compensation Act permits employees to elect, after the injury, whether to sue for negligence or to avail themselves of its compensation provisions, does not
establish that it would be obnoxious to New Hampshire public
policy to give effect, ut supra, to the Vermont statute in cases
involving only the rights of residents of that State. P. 161.
5. Acceptance of the New Hampshire Workmen's Compensation Act
by a Vermont employer in order to save certain common law
defenses, if sued by employees resident in the former State held
not an abandonment of the employer's defense under the Vermont
Act in -respect of an employee who resided in Vermont and was

Argument for Respondent.

Mr. Robert W. Upton, with whom Mr. John E. Benton was on the brief, for respondent.
The plaintiff's intestate having received the injuries
which caused his death in New Hampshire, the rights of
the parties depend primarily upon the laws of that State.
Martin v. West, 222 U. S. 191; Atlantic Transport Co. v.
Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52; Gould's Case, 215 Mass. 480;
Saloshin v. Houle, 155 Atl. 47.
The New Hampshire statute providing for the survival
of actions for wrongful death is not based upon Lord
Campbell's Act. The measure of damages is not the loss
to dependents. Imbriani v. Anderson, 76 N. H. 491. As
originally enacted, the statute was quasi penal, and gave
rights only as against railroads. The essential characteristics of this statute have been preserved. Holland v.
Morley Button Co., 83 N. H. 482. See also Dillon v. Railway, 73 N. H. 367; Davis v. Herbert, 78 N. H. 179. They
are opposed to the law in most jurisdictions. Decisions
from other jurisdictions might aid but would scarcely
control in its interpretation. Likewise, in the development of workmen's compensation New Hampshire has
not followed the general trend.
New Hampshire recognizes that compensation does not
compensate the injured employee for his loss. The right
of the employee to recover his entire loss when his injury is due solely to the negligence of his employer has
been maintained. Under the New Hampshire system the
benefits of compensation are assured to the employee and
the inflexibility and injustice of an' exclusive system of
compensation largely eliminated. The Legislature of
New Hampshire has repeatedly refused to abolish the
right of election after injury. The differences in policy
between New Hampshire and the other States are such
that the rights of the parties to this action may not properly be determined by decisions from other jurisdictions.
Having set up its acceptance of the New Hampshire
Act and obtained the benefit of it in this action, the peti-

tioner ought not to be heard to assert that the acceptance
did not extend to the respondent's intestate. The legal
consequences naturally attaching to the petitioner's acceptance are not enlarged if the petitioner is held to the
law of the trial. The acceptance was unlimited.
A contract intended to exempt Ithe employer from
liability for negligence is against the public policy of New
Hampshire and invalid. Saloshin v. Houle, 155 Atl. 47.
It is asserted "that compensation acts are not contrary
to the public policy." But in so far as this may be true,
the result has been attained by legislative action. At
common law contracts intended to relieve the employer
from liability from future negligence are invalid. Piper v.
Railroad, 75 N. H. 228; Johnston v. Fargo, 184 N. Y. 379.
The reasonableness of the consideration does not enter
into the determination of the validity of such agreements.
Consequently, agreements embodying compensation
principles have been held valid only if they preserve to
the employee "the right to elect whether he will sue his
employer or accept benefits from the association." Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Miller, 76 Fed. 439; Twaits v.
Pennsylvania R. Co., 77 N. J. Eq. 103. See also Day v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 179 Fed. 26; Johnson v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 163 Pa. 127; Otis v. Pennsylvania Co., 71 Fed. 136; Labatt, Master & Servant, 2d ed.,
§ 1921.
In determining whether such a contract as that said to
have been made in Vermont ought to be enforced in New
Hampshire, a fair test is to inquire whether such a contract if made in New Hampshire would be valid. It is
plain that it would not be enforcible. Piper v. Railroad,
75 N. H. 228; Conn v. Company, 79 N. H. 450; Wessman
v. Railroad, 84 N. H. 475.
The New Hampshire Compensation Act applies to all
employees and employers engaged in specified employments. No distinction based upon the place of hire is

BRADFORD ELEC. CO. v. CLAPPER.

Argument for Respondent.

recognized. The purpose of this legislation is preventive as well as remedial. The enlarged liability has a
tendency to reduce industrial accidents. If the employee
were permitted by contract to exempt the employer from
his liability for negligehce, this purpose might be defeated.
The situation is similar to that arising under the federal
laws relating to the safety of employees of railroads. Contracts intended to relieve the railroad from the obligations
imposed by these laws have been regarded as against
public policy. Philadelphia,B. & W. R. Co. v. Schubert,
224 U. S. 603. For similar reasons the attempts to extend
state compensation laws to accidents subject to maritime
law have failed. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S.
205.
The respondent's action sounds in tort and is therefore
controlled by the law of the place of injury. Gould's
Case, 215 Mass. 480.
In Vermont, the provisions of the Compensation Act
were made a part of the contract of hiring, unless the
employer or employee gave written notice that its provisions were not to apply. But the laws of Vermont can
have no extra-territorial effect. In New Hampshire the
parties were free to modify this contract. The petitioner
maintained a large portion of its distribution system in
New Hampshire and might properly bring its men when
at work there under local law. The petitioner, by written declaration, accepted the compensation provisions of
the Act of New Hampshire
The petitioner's acceptance, at the least, was an offer
to its employees injured in New Hampshire to pay compensation or to respond in damages according to the
provisions of the Compensation Act. This offer was accepted by the respondent. The election of both parties
to have their rights determined by the laws of New
Hampshire, constituted an agreement superseding the alleged contract, based upon the Compensation Act of Ver-

mont. The parties omitted no act necessary to have their
rights determined by the laws of New Hampshire.
The theory that the compensation law of the place of
hire determines the rights of parties must not be extended
so far as to deny the employer and employee the right to
modify the. contract when the parties enter another jurisdiction. Moreover, it is not the contract of hire, but the
relation arising therefrom upon. which the law should operate. The obligation to pay compensation arises out of
the relation of master and servant rather than out of the
contract by which that relation is created. The relation
is brought. into existence from day to day as the service
is performed. Consequently, when the employer and employee both enter another State, there is no sound reason
why the law there should not determine the obligations
arising out of the relation 'of master and servant. American Radiator Co. v. Rogge, 87 N. J. L. 436; Doutwright v.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This action for damages was brought in a court of New
Hampshire under the employers' liability provisions of the
Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Act,
of that State, N. H. Public Laws, 1926, c. 302, to recover
for the death of Leon J. Clapper, which the plaintiff
claimed was due to his employer's negligence. The case

BRADFORD ELEC. CO. v. CLAPPER.
145

Opinion of the Court.

was removed to the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship; the defendant, Bradford Electric Light
Co., Inc., being a citizen and resident of Vermont and the
plaintiff, Jennie M. Clapper, administratrix, being a citizen and resident of New Hampshire. It appeared that
the Company had its principal place of business in Vermont and lines extending into New Hampshire; that Leon
Clapper, a resident of Vermont, was employed by it there
as a lineman for. emergency service in either State; and
that in the course of his duties, he was sent to restore some
burned-out fuses at a substation in New Hampshire and
while doing so was killed. The Company, invoking the
full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution,
set up as a special defense that the action was barred by
provisions of the Vermont Compensation Act; that the
contract of employment had been entered into in Vermont, where both parties to it then, and at all times thereafter resided; and that the Vermont Act had been accepted by both employer and employee as a term of the
contract.
The District Court ruled that the action was properly
brought under the laws of the State of New Hampshire;
that the action was based on a tort occurring in that
State; and that the Vermont Workmen's Compensation
Act had no extra-territorial effect. Accordingly, that
court rejected the special defense and denied a motion to
dismiss. The case was tried three times before a jury,
the third trial resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff in the
sum of $4,000. The judgment entered thereon was first
reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. But upon a
rehearing, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed,
one judge dissenting. 51 F. (2d) 992, 999. The Company filed in this Court both an appeal and a petition for
writ of certiorari. The appeal was denied, and certiorari
granted. 284 U. S. 221.

152

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

The Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act provides
that a workman hired within the State shall be entitled
to compensation even though the injury was received outside the State, Vermont General Laws, c. 241, § 5770;
that "employers who hire workmen within this state to
work outside of the state, may agree with such workmen
that the remedies under the provisions of this chapter
shall be exclusive as regards injuries received outside this
state by accident arising out of and in the course of such
employment, and all contracts of hiring in this state shall
be presumed to include such an agreement," § 5774; that
every contract of employment made within the State shall
be presumed to have been made subject to its provisions,
unless prior to the accident an express statement to the
contrary shall have been made, in writing, by one of the
parties, § 5765; and that acceptance of the Act is "a surrender by the parties . . . of their rights to any other
method, form or amount of compensation or determination thereof," § 5763. Neither the Company nor Leon
Clapper filed a statement declining to accept any provision of the Vermont Act.
The New Hampshire Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Act provides that the employer
shall become subject to the workmen's compensation
provisions of the Act.only by filing a declaration to that
effect, N. H. Public Laws, c. 178, § 4; and that even if the
declaration is filed, the employee may, subsequent to the
injury, still elect either to claim compensation, § 11, or
to sue for damages at common law as modified by the
employers' liability provisions of the Act. Failure to file
such a declaration exposes the employer to a common law
action of negligence in which the defenses of assumption
of risk and injury by a fellow servant may not be interposed. §§ 2, 8. The Company filed in New Hampshire
the declaration provided for by its statute.

Opinion of the Court..'

145

Thus each State. has a workmen's compensation law
of the elective type; but their provisions differ sharply.
The New Hampshire statute, unlike that of Vermont,
permits the employee or his representative to elect, after
the injury, to sue for damages as at common law; and it
was as a result of such an election made by the administratrix that the case at bar arose. The main question for
decision is whether the existence of a right of action for
Leon Clapper's death should be determined by the laws
of Vermont, where both parties to the contract of employment resided and where the contract was made, or by
the laws of New Hampshire, where the employee was
killed.
First. It clearly was the purpose of the Vermont Act to
preclude any recovery by proceedings brought in another
State for injuries received in the course of a Vermont employment. The provisions of the Act leave no room for
construction.' The statute declares in terms that when a
workman is hired within the State, he shall be entitled
to compensation thereunder for injuries received outside,
as well as inside, the State, unless one of the parties elects
to reject the provisions of the Act. And it declares further that for injuries wherever received the remedy under
the statute shall exclude all other rights and remedies of
the employee or his-personal iepresentative. If the acci"Right

to Compensation Exclusive: The rights and remedies

granted by the provisions of this chapter to an employee on account
of a personal injury for which he is entitled to compensation under
the provisions of this chapter, shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representatives, dependents or
next of kin, at common law or otherwise on account of such injury.
Employers who hire workmen within this state to work outside of the
state, may agree with such workmen that the remedies under the
provisions of this chapter shall be exclusive as regards injuries received
outside this state by accident arising out of and in the course of such
employment, and all contracts of hiring in this state shall be presumed
to include such an agreement." Vt. Gen. Laws, [1917] c. 241, § 5774.

154

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.

286 U.S.

dent had happened in Vermont, the statute plainly would
have precluded the bringing of an action for damages in
New Hampshire under its employers' liability act.2 For
such action is predicated on a tort; and in Vermont an in.jury resulting from the employer's negligence is not a tort,
if the provisions of the Compensation Act have been accepted. The question is whether the fact that the injury occurred in New Hampshire leaves its courts free to
subject the employer to liability as for a tort. That is,
may the New Hampshire courts disregard the relative
rights of the parties as determined by the laws of Vermont where they resided and made the contract of employment; or must they give effect to the Vermont Act,
and to the agreement implied therefrom, that the only
right of the employee against the employer, in case of
injury, shall be the claim for compensation provided by
the statute?
Second. If the conflict presented were between the laws
of a foreign country and those of New Hampshire, its
courts would be free, so far as the restrictions of federal
law are concerned, to attach legal consequences to acts
done within the State, without reference to the undertaking of the parties, entered into at their common residence
abroad, that such consequences should not be enforced
between them. But the conflict here is between the laws
of two States; and the Company in setting up as a defense
a right arising under the Vermont statute, invokes Art.
IV, § 1, of the Federal Constitution, which declares that
"full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the
public acts . . . of every other State." That a statute

New Hampshire is bound equally with courts of the State
to observe the command of the full faith and credit clause,
where applicable.' The precise question for decision is
whether that clause is applicable to the situation here
presented.
Third. The administratrix contends that the full faith
and credit clause is not applicable. The argument is that
to recognize the Vermont Act as a defense to the New

faith and credit is enjoined by the Constitution only in
respect to those public acts which are within the legislative jurisdiction of the enacting State. See National

the power of Vermont to effect legal consequences by

Opinion of the Court.

The existence of this power is not denied. It is contended
only that the rights thus created need not be recognized
in an action brought in another State; that a provision
which Vermont may validly enforce in its own courts
need not be given effect when the same facts are presented for adjudication in New Hampshire.
The answer is that such recognition in New Hampshire of the rights created by the Vermont Act, can not,
in any proper sense, be termed an extra-territorial ap-

plication of that Act. 7 Workmen's compensati6n acts are

eccurring outside 'the state are summarized in Schneider, "The Law

.' The statute does not undertake to prohibit acts beyond the borders of the. State. Compare Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578;
Nutting v. Massachusetts, 183 U. S. 553, 557. It does not attempt
to forbid or regulate subsequent modification of the Vermont contract, or the formation of subsidiary contracts, or new agreements, by
the parties in other States. Compare New York Life Ins. Co. v.
Head, 234 U. S. 149; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge, 246 U. S.357.
It affects only the rights and liab.ities .of parties who by their conduct within the State have subjected themselves to its operation. As
to those parties, its effect is not to create a liability for acts without
the State, compare Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, 234 U. S.
542, but to give rise to a defense in consequence of acts within.

treated, almost universally, as creating a statutory relation between the parties--not, like employer's liability
acts, as'substituting a statutory tort for a common law
tort. See Cudahy Packing Co. v. Parramore, 263 U. S.

115 Atl. 449; Matter of Cameron v. Ellis Construction

Anderson v. Miller Scrap Iron Co., 169 Wis. 106, 113, 117,
118; .170 N. W. 275; 171 N. W. 935. The relation between Leon Clapper and the Company was created by the
law of Vermont; and as long as that relation persisted its
incidents -were properly subject to regulation there. For
both Clapper and the Company were at all times residents of Vermont; the Company's prirncipal place of business was located there; the contract of employment was
made there-; and the employee's duties required him to go
into New Hampshire only for temporary and specific purposes, in response to orders given him at the Vermont
office. The mere recognition by the courts of one State
'that parties by their conduct have subjected themselves
to certain obligations arising under the law of another
State is not to be deemed an extra-territorial application
of the law of the State creating the obligation.8 CoinSee Barnhart v. American Concrete Steel Co., 227 N. Y. 531, 535;
125 N. E. 675, denying recovery in a common law action for damages
in the state of injury, on the ground that the employee's remedy was
for compensation under the law of the state of employment. Compare In re Spencer Kellogg & Sons, 52 F. (2d) 129, 134, reversed on
other grounds, 285 U. S. 502. Compensation was similarly denied in

Opinion of the Court.

pare Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhard, 109 U. S. 527,

536, 537.
By requiring that, under the circumstances here presented, full faith and credit be given to the public act of
Vermont, the Federal Constitution prevents the employee
or his representative from asserting in New Hampshire
rights which would be denied him in the State of his residence and employment. A Vermont court could have
enjoined Leon Clapper *from suing the Company in New
Hampshire, to recover damages for an injury suffered
there, just as it would have denied him the right to recover
-such damages in Vermont. Compare Cole v' Cunningham, 133 U. S. 107; Reynolds v. Adden, 136 U. S. 348,
353. The rights created by the Vermont Act are entitled
to like protection when set up in New Hampshire by way
of defense to the action brought there. If this were not so,
and the employee or his representative were free to disregard the law of Vermont and his contract, the effectiveness
of the Vermont Act would be gravel y impaired. For the
purpose of that Act, as of the workmen's compensation
laws of most other Siates, is to provide, in respect to persons residing and businesses located in the State, not only'
for employees a remedy which is both expeditious and independent of proof of fault, but also for employers a
liability which is limited and determinate. Compare 'New
York Central R. Co. v. White, 243 U. S.188; Hawkins v.
'Bleakly, 243 U. S.210; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 24& U. S.219.
Fourth$ It is urged that the provision of the Vermont
statute which forbids resort to common law remedies for
injuries incurred in the course of employment is contrary
to the public policy of New Hampshire; that the full
faith and credit clause does not require New Hampshire
to enforce an act of another State which is obnoxious to
its public policy; and-that a federal court sitting in that
State may, therefore, decline to do so. Compare Union

Trust Co. v. Grosman, 245 U. S. 412. It is true that the
full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right conferred by a statute of another
State. There is room for some play of conflicting policies.
Thus, a plaintiff suing in New Hampshire on a statutory
cause of action arising in Vermont might be denied relief
because the forum fails to provide a court with jurisdiction
of the controversy; see Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio
.R. Co., 207 U. S. 142, 148, 149; compare Douglas v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377; or because it
fails to provide procedure appropriate to its determination, see Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, 233
U. S. 354, 359; compare Slater v. Mexican National R.
Co., 194 U. S. 120, 128, 129; or because the enforcement
of the right conferred would be obnoxious to the public
policy of the forum, compare Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears
Co., 275 U. S. 274, 277-279; Union Trust Co. v. Grosman,
245 U. S. 412; Bond v. Hume, 243 U. S. 15, 25; Converse
v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, 260, 261; or because the liability imposed is deemed a penal one, see Galveston, H. &
S. A. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 223 U. S. 481, 490, compare Stewart v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 168 U. S. 445, 448. But
the Company is in a position different from that of a plaintiff who seeks to enforce a cause of action conferred by the
laws of another State. The right which it claims should
be given effect is set up by way of defense to an asserted
iability; and to a defense different considerations apply.
Compare Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, 407, 408.
A State may, 'on occasion, decline to enforce a foreign
cause of action. In so doing, it merely denies a remedy,
leaving unimpaired the plaintiff's substantive right, so
that he is free to enforce it elsewhere. But to refuse to
give effect to a substantive defense under the applicable
law of another State, as under the circumstances here
presented, subjects the defendant to irremediable liability. This may not bedone. Compare Modem Woodmen

Moreover, there is no adequate basis for the lower
court's conclusion that to deny recovery would be obnoxious to the public policy of New Hampshire. No de:cision of the state court has been cited indicating that
recognition of 'the Vermont statute would be regarded in
New Hampshire as prejudicial to the interests of its citizens.9 In support of the contention that the provision
of the Vermont Act is contrary to the New Hampshire
policy, it is urged that New Hampshire's compensation
law is unique among workmen's compensation acts in that
it permits the injured employee to elect, subsequent to
injury, whether to bring. a suit based upon negligence or
to avail himself of the remedy provided by the Act; and
that 'the legislature of New Hampshire has steadily refused to withdraw this privilege.'0 But the mere fact that
the Vermont legislation does not conform to that of New
'Compare Saloshin v.. Houle, 155 At. 47, an action of negligence
by.the widow of a New York resident killed in New Hampshire while
working for a New York firm, brought against a third person residing
in New Hampshire. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that
the widovw's right of action was barred by her acceptance of compensation under the New York Act, and that the acceptance, in accordance with the provisions of that Act, operated as an assignment to
the compensation inst~rer of her rights against the defendant.

and in 1925, as amended, it was reenacted without change, N. H.
Public Laws, c. 178.

Hampshire does not establish that it would be obnoxious
to the latter'.s public policy to give effect to the Vermont
statute in cases involving only the rights of. residents of
that State incident to the relation of employer and employee created there. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Babcock, 154 U. S. 190, 198.

Nor does sufficient reason ap-

pear why it should be so regarded. The interest of New,
Hampshire was only casual. Leon Clapper was not a
resident there. He was. not continuously employed
there. So far as appears, he had no dependent there. It
is difficult to see how the State's interest would be subserved, under such circumstances, by burdening its courts
with this litigation.
Sixth.' The administratrix urges that the Company had
in fact accepted the provision of the New Hampshire
Compensation Act, which reserves to the employee the
right to elect to sue for damages as at common law. It
was upon this ground, primarily, that the Circuit Court
of Appeals based, upon the rehearing, the affirmance of
'the judgment of the District Court. The circumstances
under which the acceptance. of the New Hampshire Act
was filed show that the Company did not intend thereby
to abandon its rights under the Vermont law in respect
to Leon Clapper or other 'employees similarly situated.
It had had occasion to hire in New Hampshire residents
of that. State for employment there in connection with the
operation of its lines in that State. In case of injury of
such employees, failure to accept the New. Hampshire
Act would have made the petitioner liable to an action
for negligence in which it would have been denied the defenses of assumption of risk and injury ,by a fellow servant. Jutras v. Amoskeag Mfg. Co., 84 N. H. 171, 173;
147 Atl. 753; Levesque v. American Box & Lumber Co.,

Act employees not otherwise subject to it.
.We are of opinion that the rights as between the Company and Leon Clapper or his representative are to be
determined according to the Vermont Act.. The judgment of the Circuif Court of Appeals must accordingly
be reversed. We have no occasion to consider whether
if the injured employee had been a resident of New
Hampshire, or had been continuously employed there, or
had left. dependents there, recovery might validly have
been permitted under New Hampshire law.

I agree that in the circumstances of the present case,
the courts of New Hampshire, in giving effect to the public policy of that state, would be at liberty to apply the
Vermont statute and thus, by comity, make it the applicable law of New Hampshire. IA the absence of any controlling decision of the New Hampshire courts, I assume,
as does the opinion of the Court, that they would do so
and that what they would do we should do. Hence, it
seems unnecessary to decide whether that result could be
compelled, against the will of New Hampshire, by the
superior force of the full faith and credit clause.
. If decision of that question could not be avoided, I
should hesitate to say that the Constitution projects the
authority of the Vermont statute, across state lines into
New Hampshire, so that the New Hampshire courts, in
fixing the liability of the employer for a tortious act committed within the state, are compelled to apply Vermont
law instead of their own. The full faith and credit clause

has not hitherto been thought to do more than compel
recognition, outside the state, of the operation and effect
of its laws upon persons and events within it. Bonaparte
v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co.
v. Sowers, 213 U. S. 55; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S.
386; Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, 233 U. S.

v. Grosman,245 U. S. 412, 415, 416; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, 234 U. S. 542, 547.
It is true that in this case the status of employer and
employe, terminable at will, was created by Vermont laws
operating upon them while they were within that state.
I assume that the fact of its creation there must be recognized elsewhere, whenever material. But I am not prepared to say that that status, voluntarily continued by
employer and employe and given a locus in New Hampshire by their presence within the state, may not be regulated there according to New Ham'pshire law, or that the
legal consequences of acts of the , employer or employe
there, which grow out of or affect the status in New
Hampshire, must, by mandate of the Constitution, be
either defined or controlled, in the New Hampshire courts,
by the laws of Vermont rather than of New Hampshire.
The interest, which New Hampshire has, in exercising
that control, derived from the presence of employer and
,employe within its borders, and the commission of the
tortious act there, is at least as valid as that of Vermont,
derived from the fact that the status is that of its citizens, and originated when they were in Vermont, before
going to New Hampshire. I can find nothing in the
history of the full faith and credit clause, or the decisions
under it; which lends support to the view that it compels
any state to subordinate its domestic policy, with respect
to persons and their acts within its borders, to the laws
of any other. On the contrary, I think it should be interpreted as leaving the courts of New Hampshire free, in

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
FOR THE DISTRICT OF IDAHO.

No. 722.

Argued April 13, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

1. The generation of electficity from water-power and the transmission of the electricity over wires from the generator to consumers in another State, are, from the practical standpoint of
taxation, distinct processes, the one local, the bther interstate, like
the making and shipping of goods to order, although the generation
and transmission are apparently simultaneous and both respond
instantaneously to the turning of a consumer's switch. P. 177.
2. Therefore a state license tax on the electricity produced at a plant
within the. State is Valid under the commerce clause as applied to
that which is transmitted therefrom and sold to consumers in
another State. P. 181.
3. In deciding whether a part of a statute is separable, the fact that
the bill was passed after a bill like it but lacking the part in question
had been withdrawn by unanimous idnsent does not justify the
inference that the legislature would not have passed the statute
if that part had been omitted. P. 183.
4. A clause in a statute declaring that an adjudication that any of.its
provisions is unconstitutional shall not affect the validity of the Act
as a whole, or any other of its provisions or sections; has the effect
of reversing the common law presumption that the legislature
intends an act to be effective as an entirety, by putting in its place
the opposite presumption of divisibility. P. 184.
5. This presumption of divisiblity must prevail unless the inseparability of the provisions be evident or there be a clear probability
that the legislature would not have been satisfied with the statute
without the invalid part. Id.
6. The primary object of the Idaho statute here involved (Laws 1931,
Ex. Sess., c. 3) is to raise revenue by taxing production of electricity. Section 5, which provides an exemption as to electricity
