It is urged that the original and all later California
inheritance tax acts were patterned after the New York
Act; and that, under the New York.Act, the tax is one
upon the transfer. Keith v. Johnson, 271 U. S. 1. Compare United States v. Mitchell, 271 U. S. 9. As the highest
court of California has construed its statutes as laying
a succession tax, we have no occasion to consider the construction given by the courts of New York to its legislation. Compare Stonebraker v. Hunter, 215 Fed. 67, 69.
The Commissioner properly refused to allow as a deduction the amount paid to the State. We have, therefore,
no occasion to consider the question whether the claim
for refund was filed in time.

No. 667.

Argued April 2S, 1932.-Decided May 23, 1932.

1. The presumption that identical words used in d.fferent parts of
the same statute are intended to have the same meaning is not
conclusive. Where the subject matter to which the words refer is

not the same, or the conditions are different, or the scope of the
legislative power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another, the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes
of the law, to be arrived at by a consideration of the language in
which those purposes are expressed, and of the circumstances
under which the language was employed. P. 433.
2. The power exercised by Congress in the enactment of the provision of § 3 of the Sherman Act relating to restraint of trade or
commerce exclusively within the District of Columbia, was its
plenary power, under Art. I, § 8, cl. 17 of the Const'tution, to
legislate for the District, and therefore the meaning of this provision, unlike § 1 of the Act, is not limited by the scope of the
power to regulate commerce (Art. I, § 8, cl. 3). P. 434.
3. Under Art. I, § 8, cl. 17 of the Constitution, Congress, in legislating for the District of Columbia, possesses not only every appropriate national power, but, in addition, all the powers of legislation which may be exercised by a State in dealing with its affairs;
so long as other provisions of the Constitution are not infringed.
It therefore had power to forbid combinations and conspiracies to
maintain prices and allot customers, between persons engaged in
the District in the purely local business of cleaning, dye.ng, and
renovating clothes. Pp. 434-435.
4. The word " trade" is not necessarily limited in its meaning to
the buying, selling or exchanging of commodities; it may be used
in a broader sense. P. 435.
5. An agreement to fix prices and allot customers, entered into by
persons engaged in the District of Columbia in -the business of
cleaning, dyeing, and renovating clothes, though these have already
passed to the ultimate consumers, is in restraint of "trade " within
the meaning of § 3 of the Sherman Act. P. 437.

The business of purveying a standardized, nonpersonal

It would be a strange reversal, after five centuries, to

the terms of which, "at least in their rudimentary meaning, took their origin in the common law."

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit brought by the United States against
appellants to enjoin them from continuing, in the District
of Columbia, an alleged combination and conspiracy in
restraint of trade and commerce in cleaning, dyeing and
otherwise renovating clothes, contrary to § 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209; U. S. C., Title
15, § 3. Appellants answered, setting up affirmatively
that they were engaged solely in the performance of labor
and rendering service in cleaning, dyeing and renovating wearing apparel and other articles which had passed
into the hands of the ultimate consumers thereof, and
that this did not constitute trade or commerce within
the meaning of the Antitrust Act. Upon motion the
answer was stricken from the files, on the ground that
the matter pleaded was not a valid defense. Appellants
elected to stand upon their answers; and a decree was
entered as prayed. The case comes here by appeal under
the provisions of the Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544,
32 Stat. 823; U. S. C., Title 15, § 29. Swift & Co. v.
United States, 276 U. S. 311, 322; United States v. California Canneries, 279 U. S. 553, 558.
Upon the facts which stand admitted and those affirmatively pleaded by the answers, the sole question to be determined is whether, within the meaning of § 3 of the
Sherman Act, appellants are engaged in trade or commerce in the District of Columbia.
The facts, established as above, are that they are carrying on the business of cleaning, dyeing and renovating
wearing apparel at plants located in the District, in part,
and in some cases principally, at wholesale pursuant to
contracts or engagements with numerous so-called retail

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

dyers and cleaners who maintain shops in the District for
receiving from the public clothing to be cleaned, dyed or
otherwise renovated. Appellants, in August, 1928, met
together in the District and agreed to raise the then current prices charged for cleaning, dyeing and renovating
clothes, and formulated and agreed upon certain minimum and uniform prices, which they, and each of them,
should thereafter charge and receive for the performance
of such service. They further agreed to assign and allot
to one another the retail dyers and cleaners, who, thereupon, were to be held, respectively, as exclusive customers. The agreement to maintain prices and assign and
allot customers has been and is being carried into effect.
Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act provide as follows:
"Sec. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or
commerce among the several States, or with foreign
nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.
"Sec. 3. Every contract, combination in form of trust
or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any Territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commer,'e
between any such Territory and another, or between any
such Territory or Territories and any State or States or
the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any State or States or
foreign nations, is hereby declared illegal. . ....
The words describing the activity declared to be illegal
are the same in both sections, namely, "restraint of trade
or commerce." The contention on behalf of appellants
is that the words, being identical, should receive the same
construction in § 3 as in the preceding § 1; that § 1 rests
solely on the commerce clause of the Constitution; that
the words " trade or commerce" in § 1 cannot be broader
than the single word "commerce" as used in that clause;
and that commerce does not include a business such as
that carried on by appellants.

ATLANTIC CLEANERS & DYERS v. U.S.
427

433

Opinion of the Court.

Assuming, but not deciding, that if the acts here
charged had involved interstate transactions appellants
would not come within the provisions of § 1, because the
scope of the words "trade or commerce" must there be
limited by the constitutional power to regulate commerce,
it does not follow that the same words contained in § 3
should be given a like limited construction. Most words
have different shades of meaning and consequently may
be variously construed, not only when they occur in different statutes, but when used more than once in the
same statute or even in the same section. Undoubtedly,
there is a natural presumption that identical words used
in different parts of the same act are intended to have
the same meaning. Courtauldv. Legh, L. R., 4 Exch. 126,
130. But the presumption is not rigid and readily yields
whenever there is such variation in the connection in
which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the
conclusion that they were employed in different parts of
the act with different intent. Where the subject matter
to which the words refer is not the same in the several
places where they are used, or the conditions are different,
or the scope of the legislative power exercised in one case
is broader than that exercised in another, the meaning
well may vary to meet the purposes of the law, to be
arrived at by a consideration of the language in which
those purposes are expressed, and of the circumstances
under which the language was employed. See State v.
Knowles, 90 Md. 646, 654; 45 Atl. 877; Henry v. Trustees,
48 Ohio St. 671, 676; 30 N. E. 1122; Feder v. Goetz, 264
Fed. 619, 624; James v. Newberg, 101 Oreg. 616, 619; 201
Pac. 212; County-Seat of Linn Co., 15 Kans. 500, 527.
It is not unusual for the same word to be used with
different meanings in the same act, and there is no rule
of statutory construction which precludes the courts fro4n
giving to the word the meaning which the legislature intended it should have in each instance. Louisville & N.

286 U.S.

R. Co. v. Gaines, 3 Fed. 266, 277-278. Thus, for example,
the meaning of the word "legislature," used several times
in the Federal Constitution, differs according to the connection in which it is employed, depending upon the
character of the function which that body in each instance is called upon to exercise. Smiley v. Holm, 285
U. S. 355. And, again in the Constitution, the power
to regulate commerce is conferred by the same words
of the commerce clause with respect both to foreign commerce and interstate commerce. Yet the power when
exercised in respect of foreign commerce may be broader
than when exercised as to interstate commerce. In the
regulation of foreign commerce an embargo is admissible;
but it reasonably cannot be thought that, in respect of
legitimate and unobjectionable articles, an embargo
would be admissible as a regulation of interstate commerce, since the primary purpose of the clause in respect
of the latter was to secure freedom of commercial intercourse among the states. See Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet.
449, 505; Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, 6 Wall. 31,
32-33; Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U. S. 470, 492. Compare Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S.
514, 520-521.
Section 1 having been passed under the specific power
to regulate commerce, its meaning necessarily must be
limited by the scope of that power; and it may be that the
words "trade" and "commerce " are there to be regarded
as synonymous. On the other hand, § 3, so far as it relates exclusively to the District of Columbia, could not
have been passed under the power to regulate interstate
or foreign commerce, since that provision of the section
deals not with such commerce but with restraint of trade
purely local in character. The power exercised, and
.which gives vitality to the provision, is the plenary power
to legislate for the District of Columbia, conferred by
Art. I, § 8, cl. 17 of the Constitution. Under that clause,

ATLANTIC CLEANERS & DYERS v. U. S.

435

Opinion of the Court.'

Congress possesses not only every appropriate national
power, but, in addition, all the powers of legislation which
may be exercised by a state in dealing with its affairs, so
long as other provisions of the Constitution are not infringed. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 5.
Undoubtedly, under that extensive power, it was within
the competency of Congress to prohibit and penalize the
acts with which appellants are here charged; and the only
question is whether by § 3 it has done so.
A consideration of the history of the period immediately preceding and accompanying the passage of the
Sherman Act and of the mischief to be remedied, as well
as the general trend of debate in both houses, sanctions
the conclusion that Congress meant to deal comprehensively and effectively with the evils resulting from contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade,
and to that end to exercise all the power it possessed. In
passing § 1, Congress could exercise only the power conferred by the commerce clause; but in passing § 3, it had
unlimited power, except as restricted by other provisions
of the Constitution. We are, therefore, free to interpret
§ 3 dissociated from § 1 as though it were a separate
and independent act, and thus vieweJl, there is no rule of
statutory construction which prevents our giving to the
word "trades" its fpll meaning, or the more extended of
two meanings, whichever will best manifest the legislative
purpose. See United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385,
396; SacramentoNay. Co. v. Salz, 273 U. S. 326, 329-330.
We perceive no reason for holding that Congress used
the phrase "restraint of trade" in § 3 in a narrow sense.
It is true that the word " trade " is often employed as
importing only traffic in the buying, selling or exchanging of commodities; but it is also true that frequently, if
not generally, the word is used in a broader sense. This
is pointed out in The Schooner Nymph, 1 Summ. 516,
517-518; 18 Fed. Cas. 506, No. 10,388. Construing § 32

of the Coasting and Fishery Act of 1793, c. 8, 1 Stat. 305,
316, which declares that any licensed ship, etc., which
shall be employed in any other " trade" than that for
which she is licensed shall be forfeited, Mr. Justice Story
in that case said:
"The argument for the claimant insists, that 'trade'
is here used in its most restrictive sense, and as equivalent to traffic in goods, or buying and selling in commerce
or exchange. But I am clearly of opinion, that such is
not the true sense of the word, as used in the 32d section. In the first place, the word 'trade' is often and,
indeed, generally used in a broader sense, as equivalent to
occupation, employment, or business, whether manual or
mercantile. Wherever any occupation, employment, or
business is carried on for the purpose of profit, or gain,
or a livelihood, not in the liberal arts or in the learned
professions, it is constantly called a trade. Thus, we constantly speak of the art, mystery, or trade of a housewright, a shipwright, a tailor, a blacksmith, and a shoemaker, though some of these may be, and sometimes are,
carried on without buying or selling goods."
A like view was taken by Pollock, B., in Bank of India
v. Wilson, L. R., 3 Exch. Div. 108, 119-120.* See also
One of the earliest decisions under the common law is Diers Case,
2 Henry V, 5, pl. 26, which arose in the time of Henry V (1414).
There a weaver had bound himself for a moderate consideration not
to follow his craft within the town for a limited time. Before the
expiration of the time, however, his necessities sent him back to
the loom, and an action against him for damages was brought. The
learned Judge, in deciding the case, not only held the obligation to
be void, but quite evidently considered it criminal as well. With
some display of feeling he said--" The obligation is void as being
contrary to the common law and by G- if the plaintiff were here
he should go to prison until he paid a fine to the King." And even
a century or two later, when the rule in respect of contracts in
restraint of trade had become less strict, in Mitchell v. Reynolds;
1 Peere Williams 181, 193, Parker, C. J., referring to Diers Case,
approved 't]e indignation of the judge, "tho' not his manner of
