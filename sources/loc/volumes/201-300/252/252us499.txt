MUNDAY v. WISCONSIN TRUST CO.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

MUNDAY, TRUSTEE, ET AL. v. WISCONSIN TRUST
COMPANY ET AL.
ERROR TO- THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WISCONSIN.

No. 288. Argued March 25, 1920.-Decided April 19, 1920.
Whether a state statute is intended to validate a contract previously
unenforceable under the state law is for the state courts finally to

decide and involves no federal question.
As applied to transactions subsequent to its enactment, a state law
providing that conveyances of local realty taken by sister-state
corporations before they ha-e filed their articles with the local
secretary of state shall be wholly void on behalf of them or their
assigns, violates neither the contract clause nor the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 503.
The power of the State to exact such conditions of outside corporations precedent to acquisition of land within the State, and the rule
that conveyances are governed by the lex loci rei sits, are not affected by delivery 'of the deeds, etc., in another State; the
transaction does not thus become a matter of interstate commerce. Id.
168 Wisconsin, 31, affirmed.
THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Walter Bachrach, Mr. Hamilton Moses and
Mr. Thomas M. Kearney, for plaintiffs in error, submitted:
Under § 1770b, and more particularly sub-section 10
thereof, both as written, and as construed by the Supreme

Court of Wisconsin prior to the making of the contract
and the execution and delivery of the deeds in controversy,
such deeds were merely voidable and not void. Such
statute as now administered and enforced against plaintiffs in error by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, so as to

declaring the deeds void and in refusing to give them
efficacy, notwithstanding the validating statute of 1917,
deprived plaintiffs in error of their property, without due
process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The legislature of Wisconsin, by the passage of the
amendatory Act of May 11, 1917, confirmed the title of
the Realty Company, its grantee and successors in title,
and absolutely and unconditionally validated the title
theretofore attempted to be granted by the Trust Company and Robinson.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE, MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of

the court.
The court below declared null and void two separate
deeds whereby defendants in error undertook to convey
to the Realty Realization Company, a Maine corporation,
certain land in Wisconsin upon the ground that the grantee
had failed to comply with the statute of the State prescribing conditions under which foreign corporations might
acquire title to property therein. The deeds were dated
and delivered in Illinois February 28, 1913. A subsequent
deed from the Realty Company and a mortgage by its
grantee were also declared ineffective, but they need not be
separately considered here. 168 Wisconsin, 31.
At the time of the transactions in question the applicable
statutory provisions concerning foreign corporations were
sub-sections 2 and 10 of § 1770b, Wisconsin Statutes, 1911,
which follow:
Sec. 1770b. "2. No corporation, incorporated or organized otherwise than under the laws of this state, except
railroad corporations, corporations or associations created
solely for religious or charitable purposes, insurance
companies and fraternal or beneficiary corporations,
societies, orders and associations furnishing life or casualty insurance or indemnity upon the mutual or assessment plan, shall transact business or acquire, hold, or
dispose of property in this state until such corporation
shall have caused to be filed in the office of the secretary of
state a copy of its charter, articles of association or incorporation and all amendments thereto duly certified by the
secretary of state of the state wherein the corporation was
organized. . .
Sec. 1770b. "10 ....
Every contract made by or
on behalf of any such foreign corporation, affecting the
personal liability thereof or relating to property within
this state, before it shall have complied with the provisions

252 U. S.

of this section, shall be wholly void on its behalf and on
behalf of its assigns, but shall be enforceable against it or
them."
The original proceeding was instituted March 30, 1913.
While it was pending in the Circuit Court the Realty
Company complied with § 1770b and obtained a license to
do business and hold property in Wisconsin-October,
1915. On May 11, 1917, the legislature enacted c. 211,
Laws of 1917, which amended sub-section 1 of § 1770j of
the statute to read:
"Any corporation organized otherwise than under the
laws of this state, having acquired, or attempted to acquire, legal title by deed, or lease to any real property in
this state, before complying with the terms of section
1770b of the statutes, and which is now not required to
comply with said section or which has thereafter, and before the passage of this section, complied with said section,
shall be and is hereby relieved from any disability provided in said statute or prohibition therein contained, so
far as said section relates to the acquisition and holding of
the property so acquired, or attempted to be acquired, and
the title so acquired, or attempted to be acquired, is
hereby confirmed."
Plaintiffs in error unsuccessfully challenged the validity
of § 1770b upon the ground of conflict with the contract
clause, § 10, Article I of 'the-Federal Constitution and the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They
further insisted that if § 1770j as amended by c. 211, Laws
ot 1917,, Was upt so aptlied as to 'validate the deeds in
question, rights, privileges and immunities garanteed
tol theW by the Fourteenth Amendment would be infringed!
Obviously, no impairment of any federal right resulted
from the construction placed upon § 1770j as amended in
1917. Whether that section did or did not validate a contract theretofore unenforceable was a question for the

MUNDAY v. WISCONSIN TRUST CO.

Opinion of the Court.

state court finally to decide-it involved no right under
the Constitution or laws of the United States.
Section 1770b was enacted prior to the transactions here
in question and the settled doctrine is that the contract
clause applies only to legislation subsequent in time to the
contract alleged to have been impaired. Cross Lake
Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, 224 U. S.632, 639.
In support of the claim that sub-section 10, § 1770b as
construed by the court below conflicts with the due process
clause it is said: "The contract between the defendants in
error and the Realty Company, and the deeds delivered in
compliance therewith were all made in Illinois They
have been declared void in the State of Wisconsin. So
applied the statute deprives plaintiffs in error of their
property without due process of law."
Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S.578, 591, is relied upon
as adequate authority to support the point presented; but
we think it is wholly irrelevant.
Where interstate commerce is not directly affected, a
State may forbid foreign corporations from doing business
or acquiring property within her borders except upon such
terms as those prescribed by the Wisconsin statute.
Fritts v. Palmer, 132 U. S.282, 288; ChattanoogaNational
Building & Loan Association v. Denson, 189 U. S.408;
Interstate Amusement Co. v. Albert, 239 U. S.560, 568.
No interstate commerce was directly involved in the
transactions here questioned. Moreover, this court long
ago.declared-" The title to land can be acquired and lost
only in the manner prescribed by the lawof the place where
such land is situated." United States v. Crosby, 7 Cranch,
115, 116.
The judgment of the court below is
Afrmed.
