days they respectively have been there. Apart from the
possible slight difference between the proportion of days on
the active list and days of active service, the case is the same
as if each pilot kept his fees, merely contributing to keep up

a common office from which his bills might be sent out and
where a few details of common interest could be attended to.
In the latter case this suit hardly would have been brought.
The distinction between it and the one at bar is not great
enough to justify a different result. See The City of Dundee,

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRI(T COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR Tl, SOTHEItN I)ISTRtCT OF FLORIDA.
No. 69.

Argued October 30, 31. 19006-Decided December 3, 1906.

Section 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, recognizes that there arc
exceptions other than those enumerated therein in which appeals to this
court at that time provided for by law were saved; and this applies to
the appeal by the United States under § 11 of the act of June 22,,1860, 12

Stat. 87, from adverse decisions of the District Court of the United States
in cases to establish land titles in Florida.
Zfhe provision in § 3 of the act of June 22, 1860, that no claims for lands
in Florida could be presented to the District Court of the United States
that had been theretofore presented before any board of-commissioners
or other public officers acting under authority of Congress and rejected
as being fraudulent, held to bar a claim which had been presented to
a judge of the Superior Court of Florida under the act of May 23, 1828,
4 Stat. 284, and by him refused and rejected on the ground of, an unwarranted alteration of the register of the grant in a particular material
to its validity.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

The Solicitor General, and Mr. Robert A. Howard, Special
Assistant Attorney, for the United States:
This court has jurisdiction. The appeal by the United
States to this court is special and mandatory under § 11 of
the act of 1860; therefore the Circuit Court of Appeals Act
does not apply. This principle is recognized respecting original jurisdiction under the act of August 13, 1888. Re Hohorst,
150 U. S. 653, 661. Gwin v. United States, 184 U. S. 669,
distinguished.
If the Circuit Court of Appeals Act applies, the construction
of the treaty is really and substantially drawn in question in
this case. The petitioners adduced testimony for a grant of
January 10, 1818, still in reliance upon the treaty, and not
until the final amendment did they repudiate the treaty and
rely solely on the act of 1860. Mitchell v. Furman, 180 U. S.
402, supports the treaty ground of jurisdiction here. It is
doubtful if any other than a direct appeal would lie. American Sugar Refining Co. v. New Orleans, 181 U. S. 277, 281.
As to the statute of limitation, the amendments to the
Original petition made a different cause of action, which was
barred by the limitation of the act of 1860 as extended by the
act of 1875. The Harrisburg, 199 U. S. 199, 214; Gray v.
Trapnall, 23 Arkansas, 510, 512; Lytle v. State, 17 Arkansas,
608, 649; Marstellar v. McClean, 7 Cr. 156; Bennington v.
Dinsmore, 2 Gill (Md.), 348; United States v. Martinez, 196
U. S. 459; United States v. Heirs of Innerarity, 19 Wall. 595;
United States v. Watkins, 97 U. S. 219, 223; Union Pacific
R. R. Co. v. Wyler, 158 U. S. 285.
As to the amendment of 1878 adding the Innerarity heirs
as parties, the briefs herein reveal an antagonism between
the Forbes and Innerarity interests, which certainly imports
the introduction of a new cause of action. As to the amendment of 1904, the proper time to make it was after the answer
of the United States, setting up the treaty bar and the adjudication of 1830. But they chose to speculate with testimony
for the regularity of the grant as of January 10, 1818, and then

faced about squarely with the claim of a grant of February 20.
This change came too late. The new declaration is a material
and fatal variance. They cannot avail of a document which
the United States pleaded and produced for the purpose of
showing that a grant of January 10 was :impossible, because
there was no valid grant at all, in order to maintain the document as a valid grant of February 20.
The claim is barred by the former adjudication under the
act of May 23, 1828. The territorial court adjudged this grant
in 1830 under laws which discredited claims antedated or forged
as well as claims annulled by the treaty (§ 6, act of 1828),
and gave the court full power to determine all questions arising
(§ 2, act of 1824). That court refused and rejected the claim
on grounds going to the validity of the record itself, that is,
because the instrument was null and void. In the court's
view the grant was not guaranteed by the treaty because it
was fundamentally invalid under the law by reason 6f the
alterations. It was not a valid grant before January 24,
1818, because it was not valid at all. The suit of 1830 was in
fact a suit ending in a decree between the same parties about
the same property, wherein the whole right and all possible
rights were litigated. No appeal was taken, and the statute
expressly provided that, no appeal being taken, the, judgment
of the lower court was final and conclusive. The principles
laid down by statutes and decisions of this court which are to
guide in these cases require a court adjudicating under § 11
of the act of 1860 to regard the principles of the proviso to
§ 3. A claim previously rejected by an authorized tribunal as
fraudulent shall not be confirmed, nor one twice rejected on
the merits by previous boards. The commissioners of 1824
disapproved this claim; Congress did not confirm it, which is
tantamount to rejection; the territorial court of 1830 rejected
it. Judge Brackenridge was a "public officer acting under
authority of Congress" within the proviso of §3' of the act
of 1860, which was evidently framed to cover every examination made by any authorized body. The various statutes

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

appoint commissioners, registers and receivers, who are frequently called boards of commissioners and courts or judges
of. courts. These latter are clothed with judicial powers and
are the only officers who do not act-in the capacity of commissioners. That they are public officers cannot be disputed.
United States v. Baca, 184 U. S. 653, simply held that grants
specially confirmed by acts of Congress were outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Private Land Claims by the terms of
the statute. There was no such resti'iction on the authority
of Judge Brackenridge, but he was empowered to adjudicate
this case completely, and did. 'He was right on the merits and
as to the Spanish law. Appellees' argument is wholly inconsistent. They say, in effect, that the court ought to accept
the unexplained alteration of the registro as regular and
official, because in that form only the Spanish authorities
certified the document on several occasions; or that the court
ought to say that the alteration is.to be wholly ignored, the
grant saved under the act of 1860 despite the treaty, and the
instrument valid without suspicion of fraud. These alternative propositions are fatally antagonistic. The mere antedating of such foreign grants has always lain under condemnation as contrary to the principles of law, justice and
equiity by which the adjudications a'e gutided, and the strongest presumptions should run against an alteration -which
antedates, when the change attempts to place the instrument
ahead of the absolute bar of an intervening date. United
States v. Gadbraith, 2 B1. 394, cannot be distinguished, as
counsel suggest, because there the whole grant was fabricated.
There is no distinction. Here the grant was made when the
authorities had no power, and was antedated with the same
motive and purpose as in the Galbraith case.
The act of 1860.does not validate the claim. In the McMicken case, 97 U. S. 204, the court said that-" claims invalid
from intrinsic defects in 1815 or 1825 are not helped by the
act of -1860." In the Lynde case, 11 Wall. 632, it was declared that the validating effect of the act of 1860 was "sub-

ject, of course, to the express exceptions of the treaty of 1819
and the supplenentary declaration of- the King of Spain
finally annexed thercto;" and that "if it should appear that
a grant was obtained by fraud or was affected by any other
special vice, it would be the duty of the tribunals to reject
it." The treaty reservation of the Lynde case cannot refer
only to the three specifically annulled grants mentioned in the
King of Spain's supp)leentary declaration appended to the
treaty, because the language of the opinion is in the conjunctive. The treaty contained the express cxceptions, but
no specific annulments. Besides other grants than the three
named were meant to be annulled, and they were, therefore,
within the express exceptions of the treaty. The three grants
were not excluded by name, to save the honor of the King,
and also because there were other similar grants; "to have
named them might have left room for a presumptive inference in favor of others, the determination was to exclude
them all." Arredondo case, 6 Pet. 755.
The opinion in the Morant case, 123 U. S. 335, did not intend to open the door to a grant made after January 24, 1818.
It only saves those grants which were initiated before, although not comileted by survey until after the treaty limitation. Such a grant as the one in suit, now nearly ninety'years
old, stale and rejected, antedated and, therefore, forged because it purports to be what it is not, cannot, be confirmed
as valid by this court under the -treaty or under the act or
under any principles of law, equity or justice.

Mr. Henry R. Hatfield for heirs of John Forbes, appellees.
MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition to establish title by a grant of about one
million eight hundred and fifty thousand acres of land in
Florida, brought in the District Court under the act of June 22,
1860, c. 188, § 11, 12 Stat, 85, 87, extended by act of June 10,
1872, c. 421, 17 Stat. 378, for three years from the last date.
The petitioners had a decree in the District Court, and the
United States appealed to this court .under the above-mentioned § 11.
As the jurisdiction of this court is denied, we will dispose of
that question before going further into the facts. The ground
of the denial is that by § 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,
26 Stat. 826, the Circuit Court of Appeals shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review final decisions in the District Courts,
etc., in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding
section, "unless otherwise provided by law." There is no
doubt that this enactment was intended to supersede previous
general provisions, and to establish in what cases and to what
courts appeals might be taken from the District Courts. The
Paquete Habana, 175 U. S. 677, 686. But the statute recognizes, in addition to the exceptions which it enumerates, others

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

where it is "otherwise provided by law." These words must
be taken to refer to existing provisions and not to be merely
a futile permission to future legislatures to make a change.
They do not save every existing provision, of course, or the
act would fail of its purpose. But they save some. There is
no case to which they can apply more clearly than one in
which, by reason of its interest, the United States has manifested its will to submit to no judgment not sanctioned by its
highest court. The language of § 11 is not the usual permnission to appeal, such as existed in the act of March 3, 1851,
c. 41, §§ 9, 10, 9 Stat. 632, 633, referred to in Gwin v. United
States, 184 U. S. 669. See also act of August 31, 1852, c. 108,
§ 12, 10 Stat. 99. It bears the unusual form of a positive reguirement. "If the decree be against the United States, an
appeal shall be entered to the Supreme Court of the United
States." This is a provision based on a specific policy with
regard to a certain class of claims. It is not a matter of general principle but a special trust. See also act of May 23,
1828, c. 70, § 9, 4 Stat. 284, 286, May 26, 1824, c. 173, §9,
4 Stat. 52, 55. It stands on the same ground of peculiar importance that is the foundation of the express grant of certain
direct appeals in §5 of the act of 1891. Therefore, without
considering whether the case at bar falls within the other
exceptions, we are of opinion that the jurisdiction of this
court given by § 11 of the act of 1860 remains unchanged.
The petition was filed on March 3,. 1875, by the heirs of
John Forbes. It alleged a grant to Jdhn Forbes by the Captain
General of Cuba, on January 10, 1818, that is, a grant made
in time to escape the eighth article of the treaty with Spain,
of February 22, 1819, declaring all such grants made after
January 24, 1818, void. On the other harid, it invoked the
earlier part of the same article, by which all grants made by
the King of Spain or by his lawful authorities, in the territories
ceded to the United States, before January 24 were to be
confirmed to the same extent as if the territories had not been
sold. On December 14, 1878,. an amendment was allowed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

by which the grant was alleged to have been made to John
Forbes and Company, a partnership consisting of Forbes,
James Innerarity and John Innerarity, and the Innerarity
heirs were joined as parties. The rights of the United States,
especially under the statute of limitations, were saved, and
one question argued is whether this amendment could be allowed, when the time for bringing suit under the act of 1860
had expired. We shall not find, it necessary to discuss this
question, and shall assume for the purposes of decision that
the amendment properly was allowed. United States v. Morant,
123 U. S. 335, 343. We shall assume that the proceeding is
to establish the claim and appropriate the land to it, rather
than to determine in detail the present holders of the claim.
See Butler v. Goreley, 146 U. S.308, 309, 310; S..C., 147 Massachusetts, 8, 12; Pam-To-Pee v. United States, 187 U. S. 371,
379, 380.
It is unnecessary to trace all the vicissitudes of the case or
to explain the delays. It is enough for our purposes to say
that the parties reached an issue on May 29, 1903. A master
was appointed and testimony was takeii. At the hearing
before him the United States put in the regi~tro, or instrument of grant, which was in fact the original instrument,
although the document of title under Spanish law is a copy
delivered to the grantee, while the registro is retained by the
Government. It appeared upon inspection that this instrument had been altered in the date to January 10, from February 20, 1818, the true date making the grant void under the
treaty. Thereupon the petitioners asked leave to amend by
adding an allegation that the grant was made on February 20,
1818, but had been altered so that it purported to have been
made. on January 10. The result of this amendment was that
whereas the ground of recovery previously had been the treaty,
now it was that the act of 1860 had given a right to recover
in a case which the treaty put an end to in so many words.
It abandoned the old ground, and that. no longer could be
relied upon if the amendment was allowed. The amendment,

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

although filed, was not formally allowed before the hearing,
and after the hearing the United States filed a suggestion that
it had been treated as allowed and that an order should be
made nunc pro tunc that the amendment had been allowed.
Thereupon the order suggested was made, and an additional
answer was filed setting up the treaty and the limitation in
the statutes. We do not perceive that the United States, by
its course, lost its right to maintain that the amendment set
up a new cause of action which was barred by the limitation
fixed by the statutes on the matter, and it urges that defense.
Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wyler, 158 U. S. 285, 298.
It has been decided that a decree upon a bill to have a
patent declared void as forfeited under an act of -Congress was
a bar to a subsequent bill for the same purpose upon the
different ground that the land was excepted from the grant
as an Indian reservation. United States v. California & Oregon
Land Co., 192 U. S. 355. In that case it was intimated that in
general a judgment is a bar to a second attempt to reach the
same result by a different medium concludendi. But while such
a decision might be persuasive on the question whether the
cause of action is the same or different for the purposes of
amendment, it has been decided that an amendment could not
-be allowed in a Missouri district, changing the ground- of recovery from the common law to the common law as modified
,by a Kansas statute, which did away with the defense that the
negligence complained of was that of a fellow servant, in actions against railroads.' Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wyler, 158
U. S. 285. In the present case the change is a change in the
allegations of fact, and was most material because it necessarily
was followed by a direct facing about with regard to the law.
We shall not dispose of the case on this ground, but we think
it proper to say that the difficulties in the way of upholding this
,mendment under the last mentioned decision have not been
removed from our minds.
The fundamental questions in the case are whether the
petitioners are within the act of 1860, and if they are, whether

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

they are not met by an exception to which we shortly shall
refer. The former we shall not decide. The statute by § 1
gave a petition, to any 'persons "who claim any lands lying
within the States of Florida, Louisiana, or Missouri, by virtue
of grant

.

emanating from any foreign government,

bearing date prior to the cession to the United States of the
territory out of which said States were formed, or during the
period when any such government claimed sovereignty or had
the actual possession of the district or territory in which the
lands so claimed are situated." And somewhat similar language is used in § 11, allowing a proceeding in the District
Court. There, however, the words apply only in case of a
complete grant or concession and separation from the mass
of the public domain prior to the cession to the United States,
"or where such title was created and perfected during the
period while the foreign goveimnents from which it emanated
claimed sovereignty over or had the actual possession of such
territory."
The petitioners rely upon the words of the act and upon
United States v. Morat, 123 U. S. 335. That case involved
lands in Florida, lying like the present east of the river Perdido,
of which the grant was made before January 24, 1818, but the
survey was not completed until afterwards. The court, while
intimating that such a grant well might have been held to be
saved by the treaty, pointed out that the treaty was not signed
until February 22, 1819, or possession taken until July, 1822,
and held that the case was within the act.
On the other hand, there must be, and it has been intimated
that there are, some limits to the generality of the words of
the statute. Certain large grants were expressly excepted
from recognition. by the King of Spain on his ratification of
the treaty. The act was not intended to bring them to life.
'There is a strong argument that' it no more was intended to
validate all other grants expressly annulled, but rather that
what was aimed at was the so-called disputed territory lying
west of the river Perdido, of which a short and clear account

UNITED STATES v.,DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

is to be found in United States v. Lynde, 11 Wall. 632. In the
light of that history and in view of the alternative ground of
decision kept open in United States v. Morant, if there are no
other possible distinctions between that 'case and this, we also
shall leave it open whether the intimation in that case is right,
or whether the same Justice was more accurate when he said,
even with regard to grants of land in the disputed territory,
that the intention of the act was to validate them, "subject,
*of course, to the express exceptions of the treaty of 1819 and
the supplementary declaration of the King of Spain finally
annexed thereto." United States v. Lynde, 11 Wall. 632, 646,
647. See McMicken v. United States, 97 U. S. 204, 208, 209;
United States v. Clamorgan, 101 U. S. 822, 825, 826, (" which
passed by the Louisiana purchase" in 25 Lawy. Ed. 836).
1 However it may be as to the question upon which
we have
touched, we are of opinion that this case "comes within the
purview of the third section of this act" (of 1860) in the words
of § 11, in which event the petition is not allowed to be maintained. The third section provides for a division of the
claims into three classes, numbers one and two containing
claims which ought to be confirmqd, number three containing
those which ought to be rejected,- "Provided, That in no case
shall such commissioners embrace in said classes number one
and number two any claim which has been heretofore presented
for confirmation before any board of commissioners; or other.
public officers acting under authority of Congress, and rejected
as being fraudulent, or procured or maintained by fraudulent
or improper means." We are of opinion that this proviso
excludes the petitioners, for the reasons which we proceed
to state.
Before the act of 1860 was passed, an act of May 23,:1828,
c. 70, § 6, 4 Stat. 284, 285, authorized the presentation of certain land claims in Florida to a judge of the Superior Court
of West Florida, subject to the restrictions of the act of May 26,
1824, c. 173, 4 Stat 52. This claim was presented by the
Innerarities for themselves and the Forbes heirs, and after a

OQTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

trial the prayer for confirmation of the title was "refused and
rejected" for the reasons set forth in an opinion which is in the
record before us. The general ground was the unwarranted
alteration of the registro, which we have mentioned above.
The judge was careful not to implicate the public officer, remarking that it would be unjust when he was not a party and
had no opportunity of defense. He also stated that it was
not intended to imrplicate the parties in interest: But he
pointed out that the inducement for an alteration of the registro
-a year or two after it was made, when the time became essential
in consequence of the treaty, was obvious, and as plainly
intimated that he considered the alteration fraudulent, as he
could without saying so in words. He simply avoided finding
by whom the alteration was made. He quoted the Curia
Filipica for the invalidity of a pub'ic instrument which does
not authenticate alterations by a salvado, and he concluded
that the claimants had no legal grant prior to January 24, 1818.
He relied upon the absence of a salvado, no doubt, but only
as one of the grounds for deciding that the alteratiohs were
made without authority of law, and as leading to the further
consequence that the instrument was void.
The United States set up this adjudication as a bar under
the above-mentioned §3. The petitioners make several re;
plies. In the first place they contend that if a decision by a
judge had been embraced within the proviso of §3, he would
not have been referred to in a slight, subordinate and alter-.
native way, under the general head of "other public officers
acting under authority of Congress," after the specific mention
of "any board of commissioners." The reason seems plain
enough, however. The whole scheme of the earlier acts was
that the claims should be presented to a board of commissioners. Act of May 8, 1822, c. 129, 3 Stat. 709; March 3,
1823, c. 29, 3 Stat. 754; February 8, 1827, c. 9, 4 Stat. 202.
The right to present a claim to a judge came in only by way
of a late supplement in a limited number of cases. Act of
May 23, 1828, c. 70, § 6, 4 Stat. 284, 285. The judges referred

UNITED STATES v. DALCOUR.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to -were judges of a territorial court established by the acts
of March 30, 1822, c. 13, § 6, 3 Stat. 654, and March 3, 1823,
c. 28, § 7,. 3 Stat. .750. They were not District Judges, and
there was a certain ambiguity in their standing which was
under discussion when the act of 1828 was passed and has
been discussed since. American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton,
1 Peters, 511; McAllister v. United States, 141 U. S. 174. It
was most natural to use cautious words, but there was no other
public officer which the act of 1860 is likely to have had in
mind. No further argument seems necessary to justify the
conclusion that these judges were embraced within the actual
as well as the literal meaning of the words used.
In the next place, it is said the claim was not found to be
fraudulent or maintained by fraudulent or improper means.
With regard to this we think that we have said enough already.
The claim was found to be based upon an alteration, the
motive for which Lwas pointed out, and to be maintained by
a reliance upon the unlawful alteration. The main contention is that the judge.had no jurisdiction to reject the claim
on that'ground because, the moment that he decided the true
date of the grant to be after January 24, he fell within a proviso
of the act of May 23-' 828, c. 70, §6, 4 Stat. 285, which excluded him from"taking cognizance of any claims annulled
by the treaty. United States v. Baca, 184 U. S.653. It appears to us that this argument rests on too narrow a view of
the statutes. and of what was: done. The claim as presented
was within the judge's jurisdiction. He had authority to
inquire whether it was so in fact. The document produced
by the petitioner showed a claim which he could decide upon
the merits, for the copy did not disclose the alteration. When
the registro was put in it appeared that the date had been
altered. He still had authority to decide whether the alteration was valid. He decided that it was unlawfully and fraudulently made. It would be an extraordinary refinement to say
that he had authority to decide that it was made unlawfully
but not to decide why it was unlawful. The illegality did not

Opinion of the Court.

2031U. S.

follow from the mere fact of alteration. Had there been a
salvado it might have been valid. He could not come to his
conclusion without some definite ground.
Moreover, while it is true that the limitation in § 6 of the
act of 1828 in form provides that the act shall not be taken to
authorize the judge to take cognizance of any claim annulled
by the treaty, etc., in substance it is addressed to maintaining
the invalidity of the excluded claims. The jurisdiction of the
judge was no different from what it would have been if the
proviso had declared that nothing in the act should be taken
to. validate or to authorize the recognition of any claim which
the treaty' declared void. We are of opinion that the judge
had authority to find the claim to be fraudulent and maintained by improper means.
The decree "rejected" the claim upon the grounds which
we have stated, and an opinion was expressed that the grant
was not merely annulled by the treaty, but void under Spanish
law. But the objection remains to be answered that even if
" reject" was a proper term for the decree in such a case, and
even if the jurisdiction to reject included authority to find
that the claim had been saved from the treaty by fraud, still
there was no jurisdiction to pass upon its validity apart from
the treaty, and that, therefore, the claim now may be set up
since the act of 1860 has brought it to life. The proviso in
§3 of the act of 1860, it may be said, refers to claims rejected
on their merits, when all the merits as admitted by that act
were open. We are of opinion that there is no reason for thus
artificially narrowing words that on their face include all cases.
They include as well any claim which previously had been
rejected as fraudulent or maintained, by improper means, when
the fraud addressed itself to avoiding the treaty, as when it
related to some other fact material to the validity of the
claim at the time when it was created. The fraud went to
the merits of the case. For by the meaning of the act of 1828,
as just explained, the date of the grant was as material to the
validity of the claim as the authority of the Captain General

opinion that the claim is barred by the decree, even -if it could
escape from the other objections upon which we have found it
unnecessary to pass.

NEW YORK FOUNDLING HOSPITAL v. GATTI.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY

OF

ARIZONA.
No. 21.

Argued April 26, 1906.-1Decided December 3, 1906.

A habeas corpus proceeding involving the care and custody of a child of
tender years is not decided on the legal rights of the petitioner, but upon
the court's view, exercising its jurisdiction as parens patrit, of the best
interest and welfare of the child; such a proceeding does not involve
,the question, of personal freedom, and an appeal will not lie to this
court, under § 1909, Rev. Stat., from the order of the Supreme Court
of a Territory awarding the custody of a child of three years of age to
one of several rival claimants therefor.
Appeal from 79 Pac. Rep. 231, dismissed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. D. Cady Herrick, with whom Mr. Charles E. Miller and
Mr. William C. Trull were on the brief, for appellant:
The order is appealable. By § 1909, Rev. Stat., writs of
