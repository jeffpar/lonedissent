BOARD. OF :EDUCATION OF THE KENTUCKY ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE :METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH v. ILLINOIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 103.

Argued- November 14. 1906.-Decided December 24, 1906.

The fact that, as construed by the highest court of that State, the exemptions in the inheritance tax law of Illinois of religious and educational

institutions do not apply to corporations of other States, does not render
the provisions of the law applicable to foreign religious and educational
institutions void as discriminatory and counter to the equal protection
clause- of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is not an unreasonable or arbitrary classification for a State to exempt
from inheritance taxes only such property bequeathed for charity or
educational purposes as shall be bestowed within its borders or exercised
by'persons or corporations under its control.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles H. Aldrich, with whom Mr. Henry'S. McAuley"
and Mr. Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Appellant, by probating the vill through which its succession is derived, appearing before the state appraiser in the
inheritance tax proceeding, appealing from the action of such
appraiser to the County Court of Cook County, and from its
action to the Supreme Court of Illinois, brought itself within
the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois, within the meaning
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Black v. Caldwell, 83 Fed.

The right of a State to prescribe the terms and conditions
upon which foreign corporations may transact business within.
its borders or to exclude such, corporations altogether, is conceded, subject to the limitation that unconstitutional requirements cannot be made. This case is to be distinguished from
the general principle, however, in that Illinois has not attempted through any agency to prescribe conditions upon
which a foreign, religious or charitable corporation may succeed to property in Illinois. See Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20

MR.

JUS ICE

MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

This writ of error is directed to a judgment of the Supreme
Court of the State of Illinois sustaining a tax assessed against
plaintiff in error under the inheritance tax law of that State,
passed June 15, 1895, entitled "An act to tax gifts, legacies
and inheritances, in certain cases, and to provide for the collection of the same." Laws of 1895, p. 301.
The facts. are as follows: 'Fanny Speed, a citizen and resident
of Kentucky, died seized of certain real estate in,, the city of
Chicago. he devised a one-half interest to plaintiff in error
to be used as part of its educational fund, "to be held, n
vested and administered" as other properties forming a part
of that fund. The will was probated in the Probate Court
of Cook County, State of Illinois. An inheritande tax of
$6,280;50 was assessed by the county judge against plaintiff
in error, based on the value of the interest devised.
'Plaintiff in error was incorporated by an act of the legislature

of the State of Kentucky to form an educational fund for the:
promoti6

of literature, education, art, morality and religion:

Its funds are held and -used exclusively for such purp6ses and,,
are required to be wholly expended within the State of "Kentucky. It is not permitted to mase dividends or distribution
of profits or assets among its members or stockholders. It.
does not have or maintain an office in the State of Illino'i
or engage in educational or religious work therein.
From the action of the county judge imposing the tax, plaintiff in error appealed to the County Court of Cook County and
assigned as grounds of appeal: (1) That by reason of its organization and the purposes of its organization, as shown by
the record, it was exempt from such tax under the act of May 10,
1901, amending the act. of June 15, 1895. (2) For that the
imposition of such tax upon it (the plaintiff in error), when

corporations organized fdr like purposes under-the laws of the
State were exenrpt therefrom, was'in conflict with the constitution of the Sftate of Illinois,. and rendered said act void as to
plaintiff in error, as in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendmeit of the Constitution. of the United States, in that it
abridged the privileges and immunities of plaintiff in error,
who was a citizen of the United States, and denied to it the
equal protection of the laws. The County Court sustained
the tax and the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. This
writ of error was then sued 'out.
The assignment of errors in this court, omitting the specification of error based on the constitution of the State, is the same
as that in, the state courts.'
- it is enough'for our. purpose to say that section one of the
act of 1895, subjects to! a tax all property situated within the
State, which shall by -will or by the intestate laws pass from
any person who may die seized or possessed of the same. The
act was amended in 1901 by adding thereto, the following
section:
"When the beneficial interest of any property or income
therefrom- shall pass to or for the use of any hospital, religious,
educational, bible, missionary, tract, scientific, benevolent
or charitable purpose; 'or to 'any trustee, bishop, or minister of
any church or religious denomination, held and used exclusively'
for the religious, educational or charitable uses and purposes
of such church or religious denomination, institution or corporation, by grant, gift, bequest or otherwise, the same shall not
be subject to any such duty or tax, but this provision shall
n6t apply to any corporation which has the right to make
dividends or distribute profits or- assets among its members."
The Supreme Court decided that this: amendment, did not
apply to "corporations created under the laws of a sister
State." And also decided, as so construed, the amendment
was not repugnant to the Constitution of the United. States.
The court said:
"A clear distinction exists between domestic corporations

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

and corporations organized under the laws of other States.
Such corporations fall naturally into their respective classes.
Over the one-that which the State has created-the State
has certain powers of control, and the other is beyond its
jurisdiction. Those of its own creation have been endowed
with corporate powers for the purpose of subserving the interests of the State and its people; those which have been
given life by the laws of a sister State have entirely different
ends and objects to accomplish. The lawmaking power would
find many weighty considerations authorizing the classification
of foreign and domestic corporations into different classes and
justifying the creation of liability on the part of foreign-corporations to pay a tax on the right to take property by descent,
devise or bequest, under the laws of the-State, and at the same
time leaving the right of a domestic corporation so to take
free of any such exaction."
It will be seen by a reference to the assignment of errors that
error on the validity
the ground of the attack by the plaintiff 'in
of the tax
imposition
that
the
of the tax assessed against it is
upon it, while other corporations organized for like purposes
under the laws of Illinois are exempt, renders the act of May 10,
1901, void, as to plaintiff in error. And, in their argument,
counsel say: "It is the effect given by the Supreme ,Court of
illinois to this amendment (the act of 1901) that violates the
rights claimed by the plaintiff in error under the Constitution
'of the United States." 'The construction of the act by 'the
Supreme Court we must accept as determining the meaning
of the act. In other words, we must regard the act as if the
legislature had, in explicit language, excluded from its provisions foreign corporations. If this renders the act void plaintiff in error, whether its argument be tenable or untenable,
seems to be put in the dilemma urged by the defendant in
error, and an affirmance of the judgment is required. If the
act of May 10, 1901, is invalid it cannot give exemption from
taxdtion to either domestic or foreign corporations, and plaintiff in error was rightly taxed under the act of June 15, 1895.

BOARD:OF EDUCATION v. ILLINOIS.

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff in error, of course, does not desire to take exemption.
from domestic corporations. It desires to remove the discriminatory effect of the amendment of May 10, 1901, by ineluding in its bounty foreign corporations. Can this be done?
May a court by construction put into a law that which the
legislature has left out? There is a difference between burdens
and benefits, and it may well be that a law which confers the
latter upon some persons, and thereby increases burdens on
other, may be declared invalid by the courts. But if the
courts may strike down privileges may they extend favors and
make objects of bounty those whom the legislature has excluded? The questions raise important considerations, but
we may pass them, because the contention that the act of
1901 is invalid encounters an insuperable obstacle in t1e
power of the State to classify objects of legislation and discriminate between classes. This power is not unconstitutionally exercised by legislation which exempts the religious
and educational institutions of the State from an inheritance
tax and subjects educational and religious institutions of other
States to the tax. Regarding alone the purposes of the institutions, no difference may be perceived between them, but
regarding the spheres of their exercise, and the benefits derived from their exercise, a difference is conspicuous. It is
this benefit that may have constituted the inducement of the
legislation.
Plaintiff in error contests the classification of the aeftof
1901
and the conclusions deduced from.it in an able argument, .We
do not reply to the argument in detail, because we have defined so often the principles of classification that we must
regard repetition as unnecessary. An observation or two,
however, may be worth while. It is contended that the
exemption of the amendment of 1901 "is not limited by the
decision of. the' Supreme Court to corporate takers or. users"
and that the decision, by treating the act, "as a grant of privi"leges and immunities to corporations,'.' ignored "the .test of
use found in the .;,.uiy
'To what purpose is the beneficial

203 U. S.

interest in the property devoted?' " and the consideration
that there was no necessity for corporate agency in that connection. The result of this is, it is urged, that the court made
the "power of state visitation and control" over corporations
"the test of taxability or non-taxability upon the right of
succession." Denying this to be the test,'and contending that
the test should, be the use to which the property is devoted
and the question of tax or freedom from tax determined
thereby, and asserting that plaintiff became a person within
the jurisdiction of the State by going there to take title to
property there situateq, and by probating the will of Mrs. Speed
as evidence of such title, it is deduced that it was not competent
for the State to tax. the property of plaintiff in error at -one
rate and .the property of corporations, organized under her
laws, at another rate.
It must be kept in mind that the controversies in this case
depend upon the power of the State over inheritances and the
conditions she. may put upon them in the exercise of that
power.. And this is prominent in the decision of the Supreme
Court. In considering this power, and 'classification in the
exercise of this power, the court took into account the greater
control and direction the State had over domestic than over
foreign corporations. It did not put out of view. the uses of
property expressed~in the act of 1901. nor ignore the consideration that there was no necessity for 'a corporate agency -to
execute those uses. The case presented especially a comparison of the6 rights of corporations, but the decision was. broad
enough to consider natural persons. "In laying such a tax"
(an inheritance tax), the court said, "the legislature may consider the relation which. the person or corporation given the
right of succession sustains to the deceased, to the property
or to. the State, and may regulate -the amount of the tax to
be required in view of such relation, and in exercising this
power may lay a tax on the right of one class of persons or
corporations to take, and may deem it Wise to impose no tax
upon the right of other classes of persons or. corporations to

UNITED STATES v. SHIPP.
203 U.S.

take."

Argument for the United States.

A 'Federal court would hesitate indeed to put im-

pediments on this power or declare invalid any classification
of persons or corporations that had reasonable regard to the
purposes of the State and its legislation. And it cannot be
said ,that if a State exempts property bequeathed for charitable
or educational. purposes from taxation it is unreasonable or
arbitrary to require the charity to be exercised or the educa-

tion to be bestowed within her borders and-for her people,
whether exercised through persons or corporations.

Even if the Circuit-Court of the United States has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for habeas corpu8 of one convicted in the state court,
and this court has no jurisdiction of an appeal from the order of the
/ Circuit Court denying the petition, this court, and this court alone, has
jurisdiction to decide whether the case is properly before it, and, Un.
til its judgmnent declining jurisdiction is announced,, it has authority to
.make orders to preserve existing conditions, and a willful disregard of
those orders constitutes contempt:
Wh"ere the ontempt -onsists of personal-presence and overt acts those charged
therewith cannot be purged by their mere disavowal of intent under oath.
In contempt proceedings the court is not a party; there is nothing that
affects the judges in their own persons and their only concern is that
the law should be obeyed and enforced.
After an appeal has been allowed by one of the justices of this court, and
an order entered that all proceedings against appellant be stayed and
his custody retainfed pending appeal, the-acts of persons having knowledge of such order, in creating a mob and taking appellant from his placd
of confinement and hanging him, cqnstitute contempt of this court,
and it is immaterial whether appellant's' custodian be regarded as a
mere state officer or as bailee of the United States under the order.
