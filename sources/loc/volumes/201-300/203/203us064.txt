the liability. The decree may be modified by inserting after
the words "against his entire estate" the words "in the District of Columbia."
It is objected in argument, although not in the pleadings,
that the widow of Edmund Kearney has a right of dower in
the Washington estate which descended to him, and that she
should have been made party to the bill of review. The fact
of the widow's existence does not appear of record as against
the appellee, and we agree with the Court of Appeals that
the objection is made too late.

FIDELITY MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY v.
CLARK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COUPT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT

OF TEXAS:

No. 25. "Argued'Octhober16,:'I, l,-190.-ecided October 29,1906.

A man and his sister conspired, to defraud an insurance company; the
former having insured his life disappeared and the latter as beneficiary
filed pr6of of death,' brought, suit, and recovered judgment after verdict by a jury; the company defended on 'ground that insured was alive
and claim was frtiuduilent. The judgment was affirmed and, the company paid the money into court. In order to have the suit prosecuted
the beneficiary had made contingent fee contracts with attorneys which
had been filed and the money was distributed from the registry of the
court 'to hei:: and the various parties 'holding assignments of interests
thercin.. Th'e insurance company, having afterwards found the. insured
was alive, sued in equity the beileficiary and also her counsel and their
assignecs to recover the money received by them respectively. "No
charge 'of- frau'd was made against any0ioe except 'the beneficiary, but
notice of the fraud was charged against all by virtue of' the company's
defense. The defendants, claimed that under the Seventh Amendment
the question of death of person insured could. not again be litigated.
The bill was dismissed as to all except the benefidiary.

Argument for Appellant.

Held, as to the defendants other than the beneficiary, that as the action
was prosecuted in good faith, whatever notice they may have had by
virtue of the company's defense was purged by the verdict, and although
they had received their respective shares from the proceeds paid into
court it was the same in law as though they had been paid in money
directly by the judgment creditor and it could not be recovered.
Whether in view of the Seventh Amendment a Federal court sitting in
equity may inquire into whether a judgment based on a verdict was
obtained by fraud and; if so found, set the verdict aside, argued, but not
decided.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Maurice E. Locke and Mr. Eugene P. Locke for appellant:
The Circuit 'Court and this court are not deprived of jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's bill by the provision in the
Seventh Amendment that no fact tried by a jury shall be
otherwise reexamined by any court of the United States than
according to the rules of the common law, as under the common law, as it was understood in England at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution, equity could examine into
whether a judgment, based on a verdict, had been fraudulently obtained. 3 B.lackstone's Comm. *53; Hallam's Con.

Chief Justices, 332; 2 Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors,

Chancery."
There are no American cases, state or Federal, where the
right of a court of equity to reixamine for fraud a judgment
or a verdict at law was the matter under consideration, which
hold that courts of the United States sitting in equity had not
that power.
It has been held that the first clause of the Seventh Amendment, correctly interpreted, cannot be made to embrace the
established, exclusive jurisdiction of courts of equity, nor that

Co. v. Dunn, 19 Wall. 214; Ocean Ins. Co. v. Fields, 2 Story,

In a case in a Federal court, the judge may call in a jury
to find upon issues, or may have a jury empaneled upon the
law side of the court and its verdict certified to him, and
in either case the verdict is not binding on him but advisory
only. This accords with the long established practice of courts
of chancery, but is apparently contrary to the letter. of the
Seventh Amendment, and justified only by historic interpretation. See Prout v. Roby, 15 Wall. 472; Garsed v. Beall; 92
U. S. 684; Wilson v. Riddle, 123 U. S. 608; Idaho Land Co. v.

The fraud of the orighial conspirators is not the same fraud
which is the ,asis of this suit, and this distinguishes the case
from United taes v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, and United
States v. Flint, 4 Sawyer, 42. See also Marshall v. Holies, 141

Argument for Appellant.

If one person gets possession of another's money by fraud,
the law raises a promise to return it, and upon such implied
promise an action may be maintained. Bishop on Contracts,
§ 226; Moses V. Macferlan, 2 Burrows, 1005; Buller v. Harrison,
2 Cowper, 565; N. W. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Elliott, 5 Fed.
Rep. 225; National Life Ins. Co. v. Minch, 53 N. Y. 144;
Gaines v. Miller, 111 U. S. 395; Merryfield v. Wilson, 14 Texas,
224; Michigan v. Phcenix Bank, 33 N. Y. 9.
The fraud in this case consisted in obtaining by wrongful
means a judgment that William A. Hunter had died, thereby
rendering the plaintiff liable to Mrs. Smythe. Whether he
had so died was the question directly in issue in the action at
law, and the verdict and judgment therein are conclusive
between the parties and privies, save upon such direct or
collateral attack as may be permissible, under the circumstances. Bigelow on Estoppel, 90; Outram v. Morewood, 3 East,
346; Hazen v. Reed, 30 Michigan, 331; Monks v. McGrady, 71
Texas, 134; McGrady v. Monks, 20 S. W. Rep. 959.
The Federal courts and the courts of all the States in which
the various defendants reside agree in holding that a judgment cannot be collaterally attacked for fraud. Christmas v.
Russell, 5 Wall. 290; PeninsularIron Co. v. Eells, 68 Fed. Rep.
24; K. C., Ft. S. & M' K. Co. v. Morgan, 76 Fed. Rep. 429;
Lake County v. Platt, 79 Fed. Rep. 567; Maddox v. Summerlin,
92 Texas, 483; Anderson v. Anderson, 8 Ohio St. 109; State v.
Ross, 118 Missouri, 23.
The defendants Clark, Culberson, Spoonts and Phillips
Investment Company are all privies to the judgment'by assignment of interests in its subject-matter, and are protected by
it to the same extent as Mrs., Smnythe. Bigelow on Estoppel,
142-149; 2 Black on Judgments, §§ 549-550; Lake Co. v. Platt,
79 Fed. Rep. 567; Porter v. Bagby, 50 Kansas, 412.
Therefore as to all the defendants equitable relief is necessary and proper in the case, if the facts are sufficient, as they
are, to warrant interfering with the judgment.
When property has been obtained by fraud, its true owner

may recover it from any person except a bona fide purchaser
for value, without notice. Buller v. Harrison, 2 Cowper,
565; Thurston v. Blanchard, 22 Pickering, 18; Devoe v. Brandt,
53 N. Y. 462.
The exception relates only to those kinds of property whose
purchasers for value are protected by the policy of the law
from equities outstanding against their vendors of which
they had no notice. A judgment is not Such property. The
assignee of a judgment takes it subject to all equities existing between the litigants, whether he had notice of the same
or not, and regardless of the consideration paid therefor.

The appellees hold under assignments.
Appellees' position that the. assignments can be ignored,

the insurance company, and then paid to her attorneys
the fees owing by her to them -for their professional services

ment ever passed through Mrs. Mettler's hands, save the
net stun of $11,160.50, sent to her by Mr. Clark. Each of
the appellees received his part of the fund directly from the
court, in the form of a non-negotiable order in his own favor, drawn on the United States depository in which the
fund was deposited, and payable out of that specific fund.
The clerk and the judge, who respectively signed and countersigned the orders, were in no sense the agents of Mrs. Mettler. They were acting only in their official capacity, re-.
ceiving and holding the fund in the name of the court, and
distributing it among its apparent owners.
None of the appellees knew at the time of acquiring his
interest that Hunter was not dead. But they all knew that
the insurance company claimed that he was living and that
it denied liability. The notice which the lawyers had was
not in the nature of hearsay. They were dealing directly
with, and were seeking to overthrow, the company's contention that Hunter was still alive.,
A statement by one person or his representative to another
that the former has or claims a certain right is actual notice
to the latter of that right. Notice and, knowledge are two
very different things; and a man may have actual notice
!sufficient for all legal purposes of something which he does
not know and which even in the best of faith he wholly disbelieves.
As a general proposition the rendition of professional -services by a lawyer, or his contract to render such services,
may form a valuable consideration for property conveyed to
him as compensation therefor. But more than this is needed
to block the pursuit of the real owner of the property seeking to recover it.

deriving its powers from the laws of the United States will
not reexamine an issue of fact, which has been already finally
determined at law after a plenary hearing before a jury, constituted in accordance with the guaranties ,of the Constitution
of the -United States, and upon such reexamination, annul
such decision at law, 6n the ground that an improper conclusion was reached, and substitute its own judgment for that
of the law tribunal. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1;
United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, 68; Green v. Green,
2 Gray, 361.
The fraud complained of is, as-matter of necessity, intrinsic.
The insurance company was not misled nor deceived. it was
not kept from court; its attorneys were incapable of lack of
fidelity to its interests, and displayed conspicuous zeal in their
defense of the case. It knew that the issue was to be tried
before the action was even commenced. This differentiates
this case from the cases cited by appellant.
Appellants now claiming that the appellees are liable for
wrongful conversion cannot recover under any theory of
trusteeship or notice. Bank of U. S. v. Bank of Washington,

of fraud, were settled by the judgment of this court adverse
to such contentions, before the insurance company paid the
amount of the judgment, and that the respondents here ob-

tained none of the company's funds until the alleged duty of
inquiry imputed to them had been prosecuted to the very
highest source and exploded.
The right of one who has paid funds under a judgment to
an order of restitution on annulment of the judgment is restricted to parties to the record.
Where the funds have 'once become lawfully titled in an
outsider, the party injured cannot follow them, and by his
action make illegal that which had a lawful inception. Winston v. Masterson, 87 Texas, 200; McDonald v. Napier, 14

MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity, brought in,the Circuit Court to
enjoin the setting up of a judgment at law recovered in the
same Circuit Court upon three policies of life insurance, on
the ground that the judgment was obtained by fraud. It
also seeks to compel the plaintiff in the action at law, and
other parties to whom interests in the policies were assigned,
to repay the sums which they received upon them. The
judgment was rendered in a case which came before this
court, and the dramatic circumstances of the alleged death
are set forth in the repqrt. Fidelity Mutual Life Association
v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308. The appellant is the plaintiff in
error in that case, having changed its name. After the date
of the judgment the appellant discovered that Hunter, the
party whose life was insured, was alive, and that the recovery was the result of a deliberate plot. Thereupon it forthwith brought this bill. One of the defenses set up and argued
below and here was that by the Seventh Amendment to the
Constitution no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States than according to
the rules of the common law. On the facts ulleged and proved
the Circuit Court entered a decree against the plaintiff at
law, Mettler, now Smythe, but dismissed the bill as against
the assignees of partial interests in the policies. The insurance company appealed to this court.
The material facts are these. By way of a contingent fee
for the services in collecting the insurance, -Mrs. Mettler assigned to the present defendant Clark and his-partners one-..
third interest in the policies, with an, additional slim in case
statutory damages and, attorney's fees were recovered. This
afterwards came, to Clark alone. Clark and Mrs. Mettler
assigned five hundred dollars each, from their- respective.

FIDELITY MUTUAL LIFE INS. CO. v. CLARK.

Opinion of the Court.

interests to the defendant Culberson, as a contingent fee for
argument and services in this court. Clark -also employed
the defendant Spoonts, it would seem on a contingent fee.
Finally he mortgaged his right to the Phillips Investment
Company. When the judgment was recovered, before execution, the insurance company paid the amount ($24,028.25)
into court. Out of this -the clerk paid to Mrs. Mettler"$11,616; to Clark, $8,346; to Spoonts on Clark's order, $1,500;
to Culberson, $1,026, and to the Phillips Investment Company, $1,540.24. It is these sums, other than that paid to
Mrs. Mettler, that are in question here.
It will not be necessary to consider the. constitutional question under the Seventh Amendment, to which we have referred., or some other questions which were raised, because
we are of opinion that the appellees are entitled to keep their
money, even if the judgment can be impeached for fraud.
They all got the legal title to the money which was paid to
them, or, what is the same thing, got the legal title transferred to their order. That being so, the appellant must
show some equity before their legal title can be disturbed.
It founds its claim to such an equity on the mode in which
the judgment which induced it to part with the title to its
money was obtained. But fraud, of course, gives rise only to
a personal claim. It goes to the motives, not to the formal
constituents of a legal transfer, Rodliff v. Dallinger, 141 Massachusetts, 1, 6, and the rule is familiar that it can affect a title
only when the owner takes with notice or without having
given value. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 133; 2 WilHams, Vendor & Purchaser, 674. See The Eliza Lines, 199
U. S. 119, 131. The question is whether. the appellant can
make out such a case as that.
It issaid that the~title of the appellees stands on the judgment, and that if the judgment fails the title fails. But that
mode of statement is not sufficiently precise. The judgment
hardly can be said to be part of the appellee's title. It simply
afforded the appellant, a motive for its payment into c6urt.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

The appellees derive their title immediately from Mrs. Mettler,
and remotely from the act of the appellant. They stand
exactly as if the appellant had handed over the twenty-four
thousand dollars in gold to her and she thereupon had handed
their proportion to them. We are putting no emphasis on
the fact that the thing transferred was money. The appellees
knew from what fund they were paid, from what source it
came, and why it was paid to Mrs. Mettler. We are insisting
only that the title had passed to them. But we repeat that,
as the title had passed, the appellant must find some equity
before it can disturb it, and we now add that, as there is no
question that the appellees took for value, that is in payment
for their services, or, if it be preferred, in performance of Mrs.
Mettler's contingent promise, the equity must be founded
upon notice.
. The notice to be shown is notice of the fact that the judgment which induced the appellant's payment was obtained
,by fraud. But notice cannot be established by the mere fact
that while the appellees held an interest in the policies only
they were assignees of choses in action, and took them subject
to the equities. That is due to a chose in action not being
negotiable. It does not stand on notice. The general proposition was decided in United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200
U. S. 321, 333, 334, and United States v. Clark, 200 U. S. 601,
607, 608, and earlier in Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612, 615,
and, we have no doubt, is the law of England. Of course the
assignee of an ordinary contract can only stand in the shoes
of the party with whom the contract was made. In the discussions of the rule which we have seen, we have found no
other reason offered, as no other is necessary. But the assumption of the good faith of the assignee occurs in more cases
than one.
The principle which we apply is. further illustrated by the
priority given to the later of two equitable titles, if the legal
title be added to it, 2 Pomeroy, Eq. 3d ed., §§ 727, 768, by the
doctrine of tacking, and, in some degree, by the great dis-

Opinion of the Court:

tinction recognized in other respects between the holder of
title under an executed contract and a party to a contract
merely executory. See 1 Williams V. & P. 540, and cases
cited. We may add further that, even if we were wrong, the
equities to which an assignee takes subject hre equities existing at the time of. the assignment, 1 Williams V. & P. 584,
and that the notice with which he is supposed to be charged,
as an assignee can be of nothing more. Therefore merely as
assignees the appellees had not notice'of the as yet unaccomplished fraud in obtaining the judgment. The policies were
honest contracts and it was an interest in the policies which
was assigned, at least to Clark.
The appellant is driven, therefore, to contend, as it did contend at the argument, that notice of the denial that Hunter
was dead, in the suit on the policy, was notice of the fraud.
But it is admitted that the appellees all acted in good faith;
that they believed the plaintiff's case. -an such circumstances,
even if the answer had gone further, and had charged the
plaintiff with all that the present bill charges against her,
when a jury had decided that the charges vWere groundless,
a judgment had been entered on the verdict, and the insurance company had accepted the result by paying the money
into court without waiting for an execution, it would be
impossible to say that the supposed notice was not purged.
The appellees were not bound to contemplate future discoveries of what they honestly believed untrue, and a bill to
impeach the final act of the law. See Bank of the United
States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Peters, 8, 19.
