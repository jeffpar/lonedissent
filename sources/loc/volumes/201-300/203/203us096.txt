OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Syllabus.

203 U. S.

"The Cherokee statute which has been cited (Laws of 1892,

section 669) gives a proceeding in the nature of office found,
but, nevertheless, is confirmatory of the views hereirbefore
expressed. It relates to cases where the Cherokee government
takes the initiative to accomplish a purpose; that is to say,
where an intermarried white man- has forfeited his rights of
citizenship in the Nation by acts which declare such forfeiture,
'and the Nation requires his removal beyond the limits of its
territory,' this proceeding must be resorted to, to be followed
by a call on the United States Indian agent 'to remove such
a white man.' It is in principle precisely like the commorlaw procedure of office found, and exists for the same reason--that the Government may exercise a right dependent
upo only the alienage of a person living within its territory
presumably a citizen."
Decree affirmed.

MATTER OF MORAN, PETITIONER.
No. 8, Originai.

Argued October 15, 1906.-Decided November 5, 1906.

Where the order of the court having authority to designate the place of
trial for a newly organized county in Oklahoma is as precise as circumstances permit, the fact that it merely names the town, there being no
county or court buildings at the tin- of trial, does not affect the jurisdiction of the court, where it does not appear that the party complaining lost any opportunities by reason of no building being named.
Acts of the legislature of Oklahoma are not laws of the United States within
the meaning of § 753, Rev. Stat.
The Fifth Amendment requiring the presentment or indictment of a grand
jury does not take up unto itself the local law as to how the. grand jury
shall be made up, and raise the latter to a constitutional requirement.
Under § 10 of the Organic Act of Oklahoma of May 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 85,
the place of trial of a crime committed in territory not embraced in
any organized county is in the county to which such territory shall be
attached at the time of trial, although it might have been attached to
another county when the crime was committed.

MATTER OF MORAN.

Argument for, Petitioner.

Courts of Oklahoma Territory have jurisdiction to try a person for crime
although committed in a part of the Territory not then opened for settlement, it appearing from the acts of Congress that title had passed
to the Territory, and Congress was only exercising control so far as settlement was concerned.
Whether a person on trial is compelled to be a witness against himself
contrary to the Fifth Amendment because compelled to stand uip and
walk before the jury, or because the jury was stationed during a recess
so as to observe his size and walk, not decided, but held that it did
not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court, and render the judgment
void.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Finis E. Riddle, with whom Mr. William I. Cruct was
on the brief, for petitioner:
The District Court that caused the indictment and trial of
the petitioner was not organized as required by the act of
Congress creating it. Sec. 69, p. 75, Wilson's Ann. Stat. of
Oklahoma.
-Both time and place are essential constituents of the organization of a court. Hobart v. Hobart, 45 Iowa, 503; Columbus

When it is attempted to hold a term or session at a time and
place different from those prescribed, all acts done thereat,
other than those properly done in vacation, are as a general
rule absolutely void. Ex parte Cranch, 63 Alabama, 283; Boynton v. Wilson, 46 Alabama, 510; Garland v. Dunn, 63 Alabama,

same.
The -jurisdiction of any court may be challenged in any,

It was a prerequisite to a legal conviction of the petitioner
thiat he should have been indicted by a legal grand jury.
If the legislature of the Territory of Oklahoma was without
power to provide by law for the conviction of a person charged
with a capital or .otherwise infamous crime without a legal
indictment, then' the, court is likewise without power and
aulthority to disregard the laws which -are'in harmony with

Argument for Petitioner.

the provisions of the Constitution, and by that means deprive
one of its citizens of those fundamental rights which the legislature had no power to do.
The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its decision in holding
in effect that the legislature of Oklahoma could have provided by law for the conviction of the petitioner without the
intervention and indictment of a grand jury. Hurtado v.
California,110 U. S. 516; McNulty v. California,149 U. S. 645;

433, 460; Am. Pub. Co. v. Fisher, 160 U. S. 464; Springville
v. Thomas, 166 U. S. 707.
There was a local law of the Territory in force providing
for selecting, empaneling, and organizing a grand jury and
prescribing the qualifications of same, which was in conflict with the common law, procedure and was exclusive,
and the failure of the court to substantially follow its provisions and disregarding it in the manner of organizing a
grand jury renders that body and its proceedings void was
exclusive. Sharp v. United States, 138 Fed. Rep. 878; Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 448; Crowley v. United States,

Argument for Respondent.

The petitioner having been compelled, over his objection,
to exhibit himself before the jury and walk in the presence
of the jury while stationed outside of the court-room and out
of the -presence of the jiry was ,compelled to give evidence
against himself. 16 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., 818;

The Federal court will interfere in the administration of
a territorial court, and. even, a state court, in habeas corpus
proceedings when said court, in the administration of the
law of said Territory or Stat6, disregards and denies a citizen
his fundamental and constitutional rights, especially if said
citizen has exhausted the ordinary modes of review by appeal
or writ of error. Ex parle Reggel, 114 U. S. 642; Re Converse,

The jurisdiction of this court remains almost as originally
conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789. We contend that it
is not and that the matter of the legality or illegality of the
grand jury which returned the indictment goes only to the
regularity of the proceedings had and not to the jurisdiction
of the court. Ex parte Harding, 120 U. S. 782.
It is sufficient to maintain the authority of the grand jury
to investigate criminal charges and find indictments valid in
their nature, that the body acted under the color of lawful
authority. People v. Petria, 92 N. Y. 128; People v. Dolan,

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a writ of
certiorari, brought by a person imprisoned on a conviction
for murder, alleging that the judgment under which he is
held is void. A rule to show cause was issued and the case

MATTER OF MORAN.
203 U. S.

103

Opinion of the Court.

was heard, on the petition and answer. The various grounds
upon which the petition is supported are alleged to go to the
jurisdiction of the trial court. Ex parte Harding, 120 U. S.
782. See New v. Oklahoma, 195 U. S. 252. A writ of habeas
corpus for the same. causes -was heard by the Circuit Court of
Appeals and discharged.i Ex parte Moran, 144 Fed. Rep. 594.
The judgment also was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
Territory-in which the petitioner was tried. Moran v. Territory, 14 Oklahoma, 544; S. C., 78 Pac. Rep. 111.
The petitioner was tried in the District Court for Comanche
County in the Territory of Oklahoma. The first ground now
relied upon is that the court was not duly organized under
the act of Congress requiring the Supreme Court to 'define
the judicial districts, and to fix the times and places at each
county ,seat where the District Court shall be held. The order
of. the Supreme Court went no further in the way of fixing
the place than to specify Lawton for th&county of Comanche.
This order was made on January 15, 1902, about six months
after the land, which had been Indian territory, was opened
for settlement and the county created. At, that time and at
the time of the trial there were no county or courf buildings
in the county. The order of the. Supreme Court was as precise as the circumstances permitted it to be, and the failure to
specify a building did not go to the jurisdiction of the trial
court. There is no pretense that the petitioner lost any oppor-,
tunities by reason ,of no building being named.
The next ground argued is that the laws of the Territory were
not followed in the.selection of the grand jury, because the persons selected were not electors of the Territory and some of
them were nonresidents, with other subordinate matters. The
order for the summons stated the reason, which was that there
had been no election held in the county, and there were no
names of jurors in the jury-box; whereupon the presiding
judge ordered the sheriff to summon twenty persons from the
body of the county. We have heard no answer to the material portion of the reasoning of the Circuit Court of Appeals

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

upon this point. If the legislature of Oklahoma had prescribed the method of selection followed, that method would
not have violated the Constitution or any law or treaty of the
United States. If it did prescribe a'different one, a departure
from that was a violation of the territorial enactment alone.
The acts of the legislature of Oklahoma are not laws of the
United States within the meaning of Rev. Stat. § 753. If any
laws have been violated it is the latter one. Therefore the
petitioner is not entitled to release on this ground under Rev.
Stat. § 753. The Fifth Amendment, requiring the presentment or indictment of a grand jury, does not take up unto
itself the local law as to how the grand jury should be made
up,. and raise the latter to a constitutional requirement. See
Rawlins v. Georgia, 201 U. S. 638. It is unnecessary to consider whether the judge went beyond his powers under the
circumstances. See Clawson v. United States, 114 U. S. 477.
But it is proper to add that while the-reason which we have
given is-logically the first to be considered by this court, we
do not mean to give any countenance to the notion that if
the law was disobeyed It.,affected the jurisdiction of the court.
Ex parte Harding, [20 U. S.782. In re Wilson, 140 U. S.575.
The third ground on which the jurisdiction of the trial
court is denied is, that, on 'August 4, 1901, the date of the
commission of the crime, the place was within territory not
embraced in any organized county, and was attached for
judicial purposes to Canadian County. By the Oklahoma
Organic Act, May 2, 1890, c. 182, §9, 26 Stat. 85, 86, this is
provided for, and by § 10 such offenses shall be tried in the
county to which the territory "shall be attached." It is argued
that there had been no law passed changing the place of
trial or affecting the order of the Supreme Court attaching
the territory to Canadian County. But the very words quoted
from § 10 look to the state of things at the time of trial. At
that time Comanche County had been organized, and a term
of court fixed for it by the order of the Supreme Court dated
January 15, 1902. The meaning of this order, so far as the

MATTER OF MORAN.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

power of the Supreme Court went, is plain. The statute gave
the petitioner no vested right to be tried in Canadian County,
and his trial in Comanche County conformed to its intent.
See Post v. United States, 161 U. S. 583.
The fourth ground is, that, as the crime was committed on
August 4, 1901, two days before the opening of the land for
settlement, the place was still under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States, and therefore the crime was punishable
under Rev. Stat. § 5339 alone. The order of the President
with regard to the conditions of settlement and entry are
referred to as confirming the argument. But those orders
were intended merely to carry out the acts of Congress governing the matter. There is no doubt thaf Congress was
exercising. ontrol so far as settlement was concerned. But
there is equally.little doubt that the title to the territory had
passed, that it had become part of the Territory of Oklahoma,
and, as such, no longeF'under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States within Rev. Stat. § 5339. Act of May 2, 1890,
c. 182, §§ 1, 4, 6, 26 Stat. 81; act of June 6, 1900, c. 813, 31
Stat. 677; act of March 3, 1901, c. 846, 31 Stat. 1093. See
Bates v. Clark, 95 U. S. 204; Buster v. Wright, 135 Fed. Rep.
947, 952; Ex parte Moran, 144 Fed. Rep. 594, 602. Therefore
the application of the territorial statute was not excluded and
the murder was a violation of the territorial law.
Finally it is contended that the petitioner was compelled
to be a witness against himself, contrary to the Fifth Amendment, because he was compelled to stand up and walk before
the jury, and because, during a recess, the jury was stationed
so as to observe his size and walk. If this was an error, as to
which we express no opinion, it did not go to the jurisdiction
of the court. Felts v. Murphy, 201 U. S. 123.
Rule discharged. Writs denied.
