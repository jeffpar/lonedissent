acted with full knowledge, and the judgment of the highest
court of the State on the question of public use will be
accepted by this court unless clearly without foundation.
MR. JusTicF DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

By an act of the legislature of the State of Maine approved March 19, 1903, P. L. 1903, c. 122; ยง 87, c. 4, Revised Statutes of Maine, 1903, it was provided:
"Any city or town may establish and maintain, within
its limits, a permanent wood, coal and fuel yard, for the
purpose of selling, at cost, wood, coal and fuel to its inhabitants. The term 'at cost,' as used herein, shall be
construed as meaning without financial profit."
The City of Portland, Maine, voted to establish and
maintain within its limits a permanent coal and fuel
yard for the purposes of selling at cost wood, coal and
fuel to its inhabitants and that the money necessary for
such purposes be raised by taxation, and that the term
"at cost" as used in said vote should be construed as
meaning without financial profit. On February 3, 1913,
the common council of the city at a legal meeting passedthe vote, and on the same date it was passed by the
board of aldermen of the city, and on February 4, 1913,
the mayor of the city approved it, whereupon it became
the vote of the City of Portland. The city voted to appropriate the sum of dne thousand dollars to be devoted
to carrying out the purposes of the vote, and the appropriation was passed by the common council, the board
of aldermen, and approved by the. mayor of the city.
This suit was brought by citizens and taxpayers of
Portland in the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in
equity to enjoin the establishment of the yard. The
Supreme Judicial Court sustained a demurrer to the bill,
and dismissed it. 113 Maine, 123. A writ of error brings

cured to the plaintiffs in error by the Fourteenth Amendment. The contention is that the establishment of the
municipal wood yard is not a public purpose, that taxation to accomplish that end amounts to the taking of the
property of the plaintiffs in error without due process of
law.
The decision of the case turns upon the answer to the
question whether the taxation is for a public purpose.
It is well settled that moneys for other than public purposes cannot be raised by taxation, and that exertion
of the taxing power for merely private purposes is beyond
the authority of the State. Citizens' Saving & Loan
Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655.
The act in question has the sanction of the legislative
branch of the state government, the body primarily invested with authority to determine what laws are required in the public interest. That the purpose is a public
one has been determined upon full consideration by the
Supreme Judicial Court of the State upon the authority
of a previous decision of that court. Laughlin v. City of
Portland, 111 Maine, 486.
The attitude of this court towards state legislation
purporting to be passed in the public interest, and so
declared to be by the decision of the court of last resort
of the State passing the act, has often been declared.
While the ultimate authority to determine the validity
of legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment is rested
in this court, local conditions are of such varying character that what is or is not a public use in a particular
State is manifestly a matter respecting which local authority, legislative and judicial, has peculiar facilities
for securing accurate information. In that view the
judgment of the highest court of the State upon what
should be deemed a public use in a particular State is
entitled to the highest respect. Hairston v. Danville &
Western Ry. Co., 208 U. S. 598, 607. In Union Lime Co.

v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., 233 U. S. 211, this
court declared that a decision of the highest court of
the State declaring a use to be public in its nature would
be accepted unless clearly not well founded, citing Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, 164 U. S. 112, 160;
Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S.361, 369; Strickley v. Highland
Boy Mining Co., 200 U. S.527, 531; Offield v. N. Y., N. H.
& H. R. R. Co., 203 U. S. 372, 377; Hairstonv. Danville &
Western Ry. Co., 208 U. S. 598, 607. This doctrine was
reiterated in O'Neill v. Learner, 239 U. S.244, 253.
In the case of Laughlin v. City of Portland, 111 Maine,
supra, the matter was fully considered by the Supreme
Judicial Court of that State. After reviewing the cases
which established the general authority of municipalities
in the interest of the public health, convenience, and welfare to make provisions for supplying the inhabitants
of such communities with water, light and heat by means
adequate for that purpose, the court came to consider
the distinction sought to be made between the cases which
sustain the authority of the State to authorize municipal
action for the purposes stated, and the one under consideration, because of the fact that in the instances in
which municipal authority had been sustained the use of
the public streets and highways for mains, poles and
wires in the distribution of water, light and heat had been
required under public authority, whereas in supplying
fuel to consumers, under the terms of the law in question,
no such permission was essential, the court said (111
Maine, 486, 496):
"Let us look at the question from a practical and concrete standpoint. Can it make any real and vital difference and convert a public into a private use if instead of
burning the fuel at the power station to produce the
electricity, or at the central heating plant to produce the
heat and then conducting it in the one case by wires
and in the other by pipes to the user's home, the coal

itself is hauled over the same highway to the same point
of distribution? We fail to see it. It is only a different
and simpler mode of distribution and, if the Legislature
has the power to authorize municipalities to furnish heat
to its inhabitants 'it can do this by any appropriate means
which it may think expedient.' The vital and essential
element is the character of the service rendered and not
the means by which it is rendered. It seems illogical
to hold that a municipality may relieve its citizens from
the rigor of cold if it can reach them by pipes or wires
placed under or above the highways but not if it can reach
them by teams travelling along the identically same highway. It will be something of a task to convince the ordinarily intelligent citizen that an act of the Legislature
authorizing the former is constitutional but one authorizing the latter is unconstitutional beyond all rational
doubt. For we must remember that we are considering
the existence of the power in the Legislature which is the
only question before the court and not the wisdom of its
exercise which is for the Legislature alone."
Answering the objection that sustaining the act in
question opens the door to the exercise of municipal authority to conduct other lines of business and commercial
activity to the destruction of private business, the court
said (111 Maine, 500):
"But it is urged, why, if a city can establish a municipal fuel yard, can it not enter upon any kind of commercial
business, and carry on a grocery store, or a meat market or
a bakery. The answer has already been indicated. Such
kinds of business do not measure up to either of the accepted tests. When we speak of fuel, we are dealing not
with ordinary articles of merchandise for which there may
be many substitutes, but with an indispensible necessity
of life, and more than this, the commodities mentioned
are admittedly under present economic conditions regulated by competition in the ordinary channels of private

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.

business enterprise. The principle that municipalities
can neither invade private liberty nor encroach upon
the field of private enterprise should be strictly maintained as it is one of the main foundations of our prosperity and success. If the case at bar clearly violated that
principle it would be our duty to pronounce the act unconstitutional, but in our opinion it does not. The element of commercial enterprise is entirely lacking. The
purpose of the act is neither to embark in business for the
sake of direct profits (the act provides that fuel shall be
furnished at cost) nor for the sake of the indirect gains
that may result to purchasers through reduction in price
by governmental competition. It is simply to enable the
citizens to be supplied with something which is a necessity
in its absolute sense to the enjoyment of life and health,
which could otherwise be obtained with great difficulty
and at times perhaps not at all, and whose absence would'
endanger the community as a whole."
Bearing in mind that it is not the function of this court
under the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment to
supervise the legislation of the States in the exercise of the
police power beyond protecting against exertions of such
authority in the enactment and enforcement of laws of an
arbitrary character, having no reasonable relation to the
execution of lawful purposes, we are unable to say that
the statute now under consideration violates rights of the
taxpayer by taking his property for uses which are private.
The authority to furnish light and water by means of
municipally owned plants has long been sanctioned as
the accomplishment of a public purpose justifying taxation with a view to making provision for their establishment and operation. The right of a municipality to
promote the health, comfort and convenience of its inhabitants by the establishment of a plant for the distribution of natural gas for heating purposes was sustained,
and we think properly so, in State of Ohio v. Toledo, 48

Syllabus.

Ohio St. 112. We see no reason why the State may not,
if it sees fit to do so, authorize a municipality to furnish
heat by such means as are necessary and such systems
as are proper for its distribution. Heat is as indispensable
to the health and comfort of the people as is light or water.
In any event we are not prepared to say that when a State
authorizes a municipality to tax with a view to providing
heat at cost to the inhabitants of the city, and that purpose is declared by the highest court of the State to be a
public one, the property of a citizen who is taxed to effect
such purpose is taken in violation of rights secured by the
Constitution of the United States. As this view decides
the questions open to consideration, it follows that the
judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine must
be affirmed.
Affirmed.

KIRK ET AL. v. OLSON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF SOUTH
DAKOTA.

No. 81.

Argued November 23, 1917.-Decided December 10, 1917.

A finding of mineral character made in allowing an entry under the
placer mining law is subject to be reconsidered and reversed by the
Land Department at any time before the patent issues, upon due
notice to the parties interested.
Where land embraced in conflicting placer and homestead entries is
found, upon hearing in the Land Department, to be non-mineral and
therefore is patented to the homesteader, the finding does not conclude a claimant under the placer entry who was not notified and
given opportunity to be heard; a trust might be declared in his favor
if he proved the land mineral; but not when the evidence confirms
the Department's finding.
