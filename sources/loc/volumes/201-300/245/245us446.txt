The request in question did not accurately state any
applicable rule of law and was properly refused. Already
the jury had been told that deceased assumed the ordinary
risks of his employment-a statement more favorable
than plaintiff could properly demand. The risk held to
have been assumed in the Horton Case certainly arose
from negligence of some officer, agent or employee; and if
the negligence of all these should be excluded in actions
under the Employers' Liability Act it is difficult to see
what practical application could ever be given in them
to the established doctrine concerning assumption of risk.
The judgment below is

CITY OF CINCINNATI v. CINCINNATI & HAMILTON TRACTION COMPANY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 10. Argued January 24, 25, 1916; restored to docket for reargument
June 12, 1916; reargued October 26, 27, 1916; restored to docket for
reargument May 7, 1917; reargued October 17, 18, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.
Corporations of Ohio claimed the right to operate a street railway in
Cincinnati according to the terms of various grants, etc., under
which it had been built in sections or links. A revocable ordinance
of the city council, after reciting that as to portions of the streets so
occupied, "alleged grants" had expired, and on others there never
had been any grants and the companies had no longer any right
to occupy the same, provided that the companies might continue

to operate, but only from day to day, and subject to new and material conditions, as to fares, transfers, etc.; that should it be adjudged that they were without continuing right in respect to portions only of the streets occupied, the ordinance should be construed
to forbid further operation on such portions except on compliance
with all of its terms and conditions; that continued operation "on
said streets" should be deemed an acceptance by the companies of
the ordinance and all its terms; that in case they refused or failed to
comply with it on its effective date, the city solicitor should "take
such legal proceedings as may be proper and necessary" to enforce
its provisions, or to require them "to abandon the streets covered by
this ordinance, and to remove their tracks from said streets." Averring that the ordinance impaired and attempted to impair the obligations of the several grants etc., that its enforcement would deprive
them of their property without due procss or compensation, and
that, under it, the city threatened to, and unless restrained would,
interfere with and prevent the maintenance and operation of the
railway over the routes described in the grants aforesaid and under
authority and in accordance with the terms thereof, thus causing
irreparable injury, the companies, by their bill, filed in the District
Court before the ordinance became effective, prayed that it be decreed void and that the city be perpetually enjoined from such interference, in any way, as to the whole and any part of the railway,
and from enforcing, or taking any steps to enforce, the ordinance in
whole or in part. The city's answer denied jurisdiction, that the
bill stated a cause of action, that the companies had any right to
operate as to certain portions of the line, that the city would interfere with or prevent the maintenance and operation by plaintiffs of
the said railway, or cause any damage or injury to plaintiffs; and
averred that enforcement of the ordinance was only authorized, and
only would be sought, by due court proceedings. After full hearing
the District Court upheld the grants, etc., involving complicated
questions, under the laws of Ohio, and granted the injunction as
prayed. Held (1) that the jurisdiction of the District Court was properly invoked, and that it had power to adjudicate the issues presented; but (2) that, as counsel for the city in this court had plainly
conceded, what did not sufficiently appear by the answer, viz: that,
except as it authorized proceedings in court the ordinance could have
no effect prior to a judicial determination and that no other steps
could be taken under it, or would be attempted, by the city's officers
to enforce it, the decree should be modified so as to exclude any finding upon the validity of the franchises and rights claimed by plain-

tiffs, and so as to limit affirmative relief to an injunction restraining
the city (a) from taking any steps, other than necessary court proceedings, to enforce the ordinance, prior to final adjudication of the
controversies involved, and (b) from ever setting up claim that
plaintiffs' continued operation of cars over streets now used, pending
such final adjudication, does or will amount to an acceptance of the
ordinance or in any way prejudice their rights.
Upon appeal, the cause is subject to review upon both law and facts,
and that relief should be granted which is proper upon the case as it

five or six miles to the city limits. It was built in sections
or links under grants, ordinances, permissions, contracts,

rise to conflicting contentions, based primarily upon different interpretations of statutes and laws of Ohio. April
21, 1914, the City Council passed the ordinance copied

Shortly before the ordinance was to become effective,
appellee companies-both Ohio corporations-filed a
bill in the United States District Court, Southern District
of Ohio, wherein they set out their interest in the railway,
the various grants, ordinances, contracts, etc., under
which it had been constructed, together with rights
claimed. It then alleged: "Notwithstanding the contract
rights of plaintiffs as hereinabove set forth, the defendboundary of the City in the District formerly known as Hartwell; on
the tracks now existing in said streets.
Section 2. On and after the taking effect of this ordinance the operation of street cars on said streets shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions as existed under the prior alleged grants, if any, so
far as not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance, and shall
be subject to the following conditions:
A. That the necessary arrangements be made to operate cars from
the aforesaid northern boundary of the City over said streets to Sixth
and Walnut Streets in substantially the same manner and with substantially the same frequency as now, and as a continuous line; and
that street cars shall be operated.
B. That for a continuous trip between any two points between the
aforesaid northern boundary of the City and Sixth and Walnut streets
the fare for each passenger shall not exceed five (5c) cents except that
for children under ten years of age the fare shall not exceed three (3c)
cents, and children in arms shall be carried free.
C. That the necessary arrangements be made so that without additional charge passengers on street cars operated on the streets mentioned in Section 1, and passengers on street cars operated by The
Cincinnati Traction Company may transfer to and from either to the
other; but transfers given hereunder shall be good only on the first
street car available and on one not going in a substantially parallel
and opposite direction.
D. That during the operation of this ordinance the Director of
Public Service may make from time to time further and reasonable
regulations as to the character, mode, manner and frequency of service
and maintenance of the street cars and tracks.

violation of the Constitution of the United States and
particularly Article XIV in amendment thereof." "The
defendant, The City of Cincinnati, by its agents and employes, under the pretended authority of the ordinance
of the City of Cincinnati aforesaid, threaten to and will,
unless restrained by order of this Court, interfere with
and prevent the maintenance and operation by plaintiffs
of said electric street railway over the routes described
in the grants aforesaid and under authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, which
will cause great and irreparable injury to these plaintiffs
for which they have no adequate remedy at law." It
prayed: "That the Court decree said ordinance passed
April 21, 1914, to be null and void, and that the defendant,
The City of Cincinnati, and its officers, agents and employes, be enjoined by a restraining order, preliminary
injunction, and final decree, from interfering or attempting to interfere in any way with the maintenance and
operation, or either, by the plaintiffs, or either of them,
of said line of electric street railway or any part thereof;
and from enforcing or attempting or taking any steps to
enforce the pretended ordinance of The City of Cincinnati, aforesaid, or any part thereof, and from taking any
action which would alter, impair, limit, or destroy, the
right and title of plaintiffs under their said grants and
contracts."
Answering, the City denied jurisdiction of the court;
that the bill stated a cause of action; that complainant
companies had any right to operate a railway on Erkenbrecher Avenue or over portions of Carthage Pike or over
streets and roads formerly in the Village of Hartwell, etc.
And further "the defendant denies that under the authority of said Ordinance, or otherwise, it will, unless
restrained by this court, interfere with or prevent the
maintenance and operation by the plaintiffs, or either of
them, of said electric street railway, or cause any damage

or injury of any kind to the plaintiffs, or either of them,
and defendant avers that the enforcement of said Ordinance is only authorized and will only be sought by and
through an order of a Court of competent jurisdiction
first had and obtained, and after a hearing on due and
reasonable notice to all interested parties."
Having finally heard the cause upon a record presenting
many difficult problems arising under local laws, the trial
court sustained its jurisdiction, adjudicated in favor of
the companies in respect of the grants, ordinances, and
contracts relied upon, and granted an injunction as prayed.
The City has appealed and the questions presented below
have again been elaborately discussed before us.
There is radical disagreement concerning interpretation
and effect of the Ordinance of April 21st. Counsel for
appellees maintain: "The City does not seek to eject
plaintiffs from the occupancy of any particular part of
the streets in question, but undertakes by the ordinance
complained of to require plaintiff, in disregard of its
rights under existing contracts, some of which the ordinance assumes may be good, either to abandon its line
over the route in question, or to operate it on a day-to-day
license and at a reduced fare." "The question, therefore,
is not whether there is one bad link, but whether there is
one good link, because, if there is a good link, the ordinance impairs its obligation."
"All parts of the ordinance go into operation at once
at 'the earliest period allowed by law,' which is thirty
days after it is filed with the mayor. The day the ordinance takes effect it gives to passengers the right to a
reduced fare and transfers; and at the same time the
companies, by operating on the said streets, are deemed
to have accepted all the terms of the ordinance, which
apply to all the links. This operation of the ordinance,
and these results, do not await any litigation or any adjudication of any kind."

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

"While Section 5 authorizes and directs the city solicitor in the event of non-compliance to take the proper
legal proceedings to enforce the ordinance, they might
not be taken, and the operation of the ordinance does
not await the beginning or outcome of such proceedings,
nor is the city precluded by Section 5 from enforcing it in
any other way, by tearing up the tracks or otherwise."
In the brief for appellant it is said: "These two provisions [§§ 3 and 5] clearly indicate that the rights of the
City must be and will be established only after an orderly
procedure through the courts, and it was contemplated
and directed that this should be through legal proceedings
brought by the Solicitor." "The fair reading of Section 4
is that the operation of the cars over the portion of the
line where it is adjudged appellees have no franchise shall
be an acceptance of the ordinance." During the oral
argument here counsel for the City expressly affirmed,
that properly construed, and except as it authorized
proceedings in court, the ordinance could have no effect
prior to a judicial determination of the parties' rights;
that until this was had no other steps could be taken, or
would be attempted, to enforce the ordinance, and noncompliance therewith would in no wise injuriously affect
the appellees. And, moreover, that the above quoted paragraph from the answer was intended to express that view.
We think the jurisdiction of the court below was properly invoked and that it had power to adjudicate the
issues presented. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street Ry.
Co., 184 U. S. 368; Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone
Co., 230 U. S. 58.
As the cause is here upon appeal, it is subject to review
upon both law and facts; we should grant the relief proper

J., dissenting.

The answer failed to set out with adequate precision,
if at all, what counsel now claim were the powers of the
City's officers under, and its purposes in respect of, the
ordinance-otherwise a different result might have been
reached in the trial court. Accepting, and for all purposes
of the cause relying upon representations and admissions
of counsel for the City as above detailed, we conclude that
the decree below should be modified so as to exclude from
it any finding concerning validity of franchises involved or
rights claimed by appellees and to limit the affirmative
relief granted to an injunction restraining the City (1)
from taking any steps to enforce the ordinance (except
institution of necessary court proceedings) prior to final
adjudication of controversies involved, and (2) from ever
setting up a claim that appellees' continued operation of
cars over streets now used pending such final adjudication
,does or will amount to an acceptance of the ordinance by
appellees, or in any way prejudice their rights.
As modified, the decree below is affirmed. Appellant
will pay all costs.
Modified and affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE CLARKE,

dissenting.

The opinion and decree announced in this case.seem to
me so unsupported by the record and so unusual in character that I am impelled, reluctantly, to state my reasons
for dissenting from both.
The court finds that the District Court had and that
this court now has jurisdiction in the case such as to
warrant permanently enjoining the City of Cincinnati
in the two respects stated in the opinion, and with instructions to limit its decree to such an injunction the
case is remanded to the District Court, leaving open for
further litigation the validity and effect of the Ordinance
of April 21, 1914 (copied in the margin of the court's
opinion) and of prior grants claimed by the plaintiffs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
CLARKE,

J., dissenting.

245 U. S.

Assuming as we must that if the District Court had
jurisdiction of the cause it had authority to go forward
and completely dispose of the controversy, this action
taken by the majority of the court seems to me to be
anomalous if not unprecedented.
But my dissent goes also upon the more fundamental
ground that the District Court did not have, and that
this court does not now have, any jurisdiction over the
case, for reasons which I shall state as briefly as I may.
The bill alleges that the plaintiffs and the defendant
are all Ohio corporations, and after setting out in detail
the grants which had been made to the plaintiffs over
the various routes described in the Ordinance of April 21,
1914, it continues in paragraphs thirteen and fourteen,
as follows:
"13. Notwithstanding the contract rights of plaintiffs
as hereinabove set forth, the defendant, The City of.
Cincinnati, on or about the 21st day of April, 1914, passed
a certain alleged ordinance entitled, 'An Ordinance No.
-.
Specifying the terms and conditions upon which
the Cincinnati and Hamilton Traction Company and
The Ohio Traction Company, as its lessee, may operate
street cars on certain streets of the City, and authorizing
the City. Solicitor to take legal proceedings to enforce this
ordinance,' a copy of which is hereto attached, marked
Exhibit A, and made a part hereof; in and by said ordinance said City repudiated the grants aforesaid and
thereby impaired and attempted to impair the obligations of the aforesaid contracts and each of them, in
violation of Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of
the United States, and the enforcement of said ordinance
will deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process
of law and without compensation, in violation of the
Constitution of the United States and particularly Article
XIV in amendment thereof."
"14. The defendant, The City of Cincinnati, by its

CINCINNATI v. CINCINNATI & H. TRAC. CO. 457

CLARKE,

J., dissenting.

agents and employees, under the pretended authority
of the ordinance of the City of Cincinnati aforesaid,
threatens to and will, unless restrained by the order of
this Court, interfere with and prevent the maintenance
and operation by plaintiffs of said electric street railway
over the routes described in the grants aforesaid and
under authority and in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, which will cause great and irreparable
injury to these plaintiffs for which they have no adequate
remedy at law."
Since there is no diversity of citizenship there must be
found in these two paragraphs, if anywhere in the bill,
the assertion of federal right sufficient to give jurisdiction to the district court.
Confining our attention to paragraph 13. It seems
to me very clear that this paragraph simply alleges that
the City passed the ordinance, copied in the margin of
the court's opinion, and thereby authorized "the City
Solicitor to take legal proceedings to enforce" it., This
allegation is emphasized by making the ordinance, by
reference, a part of the bill, which in § 5 specifically provides that if the plaintiffs shall fail or refuse to comply
with the terms of the ordinance "the City Solicitor shall
be, and he is hereby authorized and directed to take such
legal proceedings as may be proper and necessary to enforce
the provisions of this ordinance," or to require the companies to remove their tracks from the streets. The making of this declaration by ordinance, it is averred, impaired
the obligation of the grants-the contract rights-which
the plaintiffs claim they had when the ordinance was
passed. No action other than the passing of the ordinance
had been taken by the City when the bill for injunction
was filed, in fact the ordinance did not become effective
for thirty days after the bill was filed.
It has been decided by this court, within recent years,
at least twice, that for a municipal corporation to thus

assert by resolution or by ordinance that a claim of contract right against it is not valid and to direct its legal
representative to test in the courts the right so asserted,
neither impairs the obligation of the contract assailed
nor deprives the persons claiming under it of their property without due process of law.
In Des Moines v. Des Moines City Ry. Co., 214 U. S. 179,
it was asserted as a ground of federal jurisdiction that a
resolution of the Des Moines City Council was a law
which impaired the obligation of the contract which the
railway company claimed to have with the City, and
that if given effect it would deprive the company of its
property without due process of law. The Circuit Court
overruled an objection to its jurisdiction and granted an
injunction against the enforcement of the resolution. This
resolution, in terms, ordered the railway companies to
remove their tracks, poles and wires from the streets, and
in case of failure to do so within a time stated, the City
Solicitor was "instructed to take such action as he shall
deem advisable and necessary to secure the enforcement
of the resolution." In a unanimous decision, this court
reverses the lower court, saying:
"We are of opinion that this is not a law impairing
the rights alleged by the appellee, and therefore that the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court cannot be maintained.
Leaving on one side all questions as to what can be done
by resolution as distinguished from ordinance under
Iowa laws, we read this resolution as simply a denial of
the appellee's claim and a direction to the City Solicitor
to resort to the courts if the appellee shall not accept the
city's views. The resolution begins with a recital that
questions as to the railway company's rights have been
raised, and ends with a direction to the City Solicitor to
take action to enforce the city's position. The only action
to be expected from a City Solicitor is a suit in court. We
cannot take it to have been within the meaning of the

CINCINNATI v. CINCINNATI & H. TRAC. CO. 459
446.

CLARKE,

J., dissenting.

direction to him that he should take a posse and begin
to pull up the tracks. The order addressed to the companies to remove their tracks was simply to put them in
the position of disobedience, as ground for a suit, if the
city was right."
Since the court "lays on one side" the distinction between a resolution and an ordinance, this decision seems
clearly to rule the case at bar.
Again, in Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, 191 U. S.
184, a claim to federal jurisdiction was based on a resolution of an Ohio city council, which it was claimed impaired the obligation of a contract which the water company had with the City. But this court, while finding
that the record disclosed the City as claiming that the
water company did not have a valid contract with the
City and that a suit to test its validity had been instituted
in a state court by the City Solicitor, nevertheless held
that the action so taken was not obnoxious to the prohibition of the Federal Constitution, and the case was
dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
The ordinance involved in this case, like the one in the
Des Moines Case, having regard to all of its provisions,
even including its title, seems very clearly to be no more
than an assertion on the part of the City Council of what
it considers the rights of the City to be, with authority
and direction to the City Solicitor to resort to the courts
to test the validity of the claims made, if they are denied
by the traction companies, and the cases cited are authority sufficient, if indeed authority be needed, to justify
the conclusion that such an expression of purpose to
resort to the courts of the country and to abide by their
decision, is not a law impairing the obligation of a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution.
A careful reading of this ordinance, especially of §§ 3
and 5, makes it convincingly clear that the writer of it
must have had in mind the decisions which we have cited)

460

CLARKE, J., dissenting.

245 U. S.

and that he has attempted, successfully it seems to me,
to keep clearly within the law established by them.
The allegation in paragraph 14 of the bill, that the City,
and its agents and employees, threaten to interfere with
and prevent the operation of the street railways, states
no invasion of a federal right, unless such action is threatened under warrant of an invalid ordinance. If the
ordinance is valid it can add nothing to the other allegations of the bill and if invalid it is futile.
It is impossible for me, also, to share in the interpretation given to § 4 of the ordinance which makes it the
subject of special injunctive relief. The section provides
that the continuing to operate cars on the streets in controversy "shall be deemed an acceptance of this ordinance and of all of the terms hereof." Considering the
ordinance as a whole, and not as if it were a group of
independent provisions, if this section has any meaning
at all, it cannot be more than an assertion on the part
of the City, that if the companies, without formal acceptance, but without protest, should continue to operate
the lines of railway, such action would be taken as implying an acceptance of the burdens as well as of the benefits
of the ordinance. But such an implication of acceptance
certainly could not prevail in any court against an assertion to the contrary by the companies.
If the companies really have contract rights in the
streets, as they claim that they have, such rights cannot
be impaired by the exercise of them, and if they do not
have such rights, this declaration of the section cannot
harm them, and therefore it cannot properly serve as a
basis, either for jurisdiction or for an injunction.
Thus considering the question of jurisdiction as depending wholly upon the form of the allegations of the
bill, it seems very clear that the federal courts are without jurisdiction in the case.
If, now, we consider the answer in the case we shall

CINCINNATI v. CINCINNATI & H. TRAC. CO. 461
446.

CLARKE,

J., dissenting.

find the strongest possible confirmation of the conclusion
just arrived at.
The first paragraph of the answer denies the jurisdiction of the court and asserts that it is apparent on the
face of the bill that it seeks to prevent the City of Cincinnati from resorting to the state courts for a decision
of the controversy, and the answer to paragraph 13 of
the bill, quoted above, is a special denial. Then follows
this paragraph of the answer:
"13. The defendant denies that under the authority
of said Ordinance, or otherwise, it will, unless restrained
by this court, interfere with or prevent the maintenance
and operation by the plaintiffs, or either of them, of said
electric street railway, or cause any damage or injury of
any kind to the plaintiffs, or either of them, and defendant
avers that the enforcement of said Ordinance is only authorized and will only be sought by and through an order of a
court of competent jurisdictionfirst had and obtained, and
after a hearing on due and reasonable notice to all interested
parties."

It is difficult to imagine how a clearer statement than
this could be framed on the part of the City, that the
enforcement of the ordinance is only authorized and will
only be sought by and through an order of a court of

competent jurisdiction.
When to all this we add that not one word of evidence
was offered on the trial tending to sustain the allegations
of paragraph 14 of the bill, that the defendant threatened
and intended to interfere with and unless enjoined would
prevent the operation of the street railways, it becomes
very clear that we have before us an utterly unsubstantial
and purely paper attempt to carry into the federal courts
a case which, because of its "many difficult problems
arising under local laws," is peculiarly one for first decision in the. state courts, with the right of revision in this
court as provided for by law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
CLARKE,

J., dissenting.

245 U. S.

It has been for many years the constant effort, repeatedly declared, of Congress and of this court, to prevent the evasion of the Constitution and laws of the
United States, by bringing into the federal courts controversies between citizens of the same State, Bernards
Township v. Stebbins, 109 U. S. 341, 350, and it is because of my conviction that the integrity of the jurisdiction of the federal courts can best be preserved by refusing to extend it to doubtful cases that this dissent is
written thus at length. My conclusion is that the plea
of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the District Court
should have been sustained on the face of the bill, but
that if doubt were entertained as to this, then when the
plaintiffs rested without attempting to prove their allegations of intended interference by the City with the operation of the roads, it became the duty of the District Court
to proceed no further, but to dismiss the case, for the
reason that it did not really and substantially involve a
controversy properly within the jurisdiction of the court.
Judicial Code, § 37.
There remains to be added only this: That, even if
agreement were possible with the conclusion that the
court has jurisdiction in the case, nevertheless I could
not agree with the judgment rendered, for the reason
that it seems to me very clear that the principal grant
on which the plaintiffs rely, that from the County Commissioners dated March 23, 1889, expired on March 23,
1914, before the ordinance complained of was passed.
My reason for this conclusion is that the Supreme Court
of Ohio in 1905 held the Ohio Act of 1883 (80 Ohio Laws,
173) invalid because in violation of § 26 of Article II of
the state constitution. Railway Co. v. Railway Co., 5
Ohio C. C. (N. S.) 583, affirmed 73 Ohio St. 364. This
is conclusive on all federal courts. If unconstitutional
in 1905, the act was unconstitutional in 1889, when the
grant by the Commissioners was made, and therefore

Syllabus.

§§ 3439 and 2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio of 1880
were then in force and imposed the limitation of twentyfive years on all grants by County Commissioners. The
doctrine that rights acquired before cannot be impaired
by a change of judicial decision, has no application to
this case, for the reason that there was no settled principle of decision in Ohio in cases such as we have here,
where counties were concerned, prior to 1889, or at any
other time, but, as the decisions abundantly prove, each
case as it arose was disposed of on its own peculiar facts,
e. g., State v. Powers, 38 Ohio St. 54 (1882), overruled in
State ex tel. v. Shearer, 46 Ohio St. 275 (1889).
For the reasons here given and upon the authorities
cited, my conclusion is that the decree of the District
Court should be reversed, and the case remanded with
instructions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction.

COM-

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.

No. 91.

Submitted November 23, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.

The appellant applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission under
§ 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended June 18, 1910,
for relief from the long and short haul provision with reference to
many hundred points on its line, including Nashville, Louisville and
Bowling Green. After a full, separate hearing of the conditions
affecting rates applicable to the three places named, the Commission
made an order merely denying the appellant the authority to con-
