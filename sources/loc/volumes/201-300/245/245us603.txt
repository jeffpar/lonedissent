GARDINER, TRUSTEE OF THE PERRY REAL
ESTATE TRUST, v. WILLIAM S. BUTLER & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 95.

Argued December 18, 1917.-Decided February 4, 1918.

Following Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, ante, 597, held, that, in a nonstatutory receivership proceeding brought to preserve the good will
and pay the debts of a company occupying premises as lessee, the
lessor, which reentered during the receivership, had a proper claim
for rent up to reientry, and for damages based on the lessee's
covenant to pay the difference between the rental value at time of reentry and the rent and other payments reserved for the residue of the

term.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

In Massachusetts, in the absence of statute or express contract, a lessor
who has terminated a lease and evicted the tenant has no further
claim against the lessee-hence none against the lessee's receivers
in proceedings in equity to continue the lessee's business to pay
its debts.
230 Fed. Rep. 1021, reversed in part and affirmed in part.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Alexander Whiteside, with whom Mr. Bentley W.
Warren and Mr. Howard Stockton, Jr., were on the brief,
for petitioner.
Mr. Frederick H. Nash, with whom Mr. Charles F.
Choate, Jr., was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE HoLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case comes here upon the report of a master asking the court to decide whether two claims are provable.
The first is upon a lease made by the petitioner to William S. Butler & Company. Receivers were appointed
for the William S. Butler & Company corporation on November 7, 1912. At that time the winding up of the company was not contemplated by the bill or decree, but the
object was to preserve the good will and pay the debts.
On October 1, 1913, the petitioner entered, and on December 1, 1913, presented his proof of claims. The lease contained a clause similar to that in the lease of Wm. Filene's
Sons Company, just considered, ante, 597, providing that
in case of reintry the lessee should pay to the lessor the
difference between the rental value and the rent and other
payments required for the residue of the term. The claim
was for rent up to the time of reentry and for damages
for the later period. It was rejected by the courts below
upon the same grounds as in the former case. 230 Fed.
Rep. 1021; 144 C. C. A. 663. This decision, like the other,
must be reversed.

STELLWAGEN v. CLUM.
Syllabus.

603.

The second claim is upon a lease by Russell to the same
company of which Gardiner had purchased the reversion.
In substance it is for damages similar to those held allowable under the former lease, but simply on the ground that
the petitioner has lost the benefit of his bargain from the
time of his reentry, the lease not containing any clause
stipulating for such an allowance. Of course there are
plausible analogies for the contention. But the law as to
leases is not a matter of logic in vacuo; it is a matter of
history that has not forgotten Lord Coke. Massachusetts has followed the English tradition and we believe
that it is the general understanding in that State that in
the absence of statute or express contract a lessor who
has terminated a lease and evicted the tenant has no further claim against the lessee. Sutton v. Goodman, 194
Massachusetts, 389, 395. Central Trust Co. v. Chicago
Auditorium Association, 240 U. S. 581, 590. Upon this

Decree reversed.
