WALLER ET AL., TRUSTEES (UNDER THE LAST
WILL AND TESTAMENT) OF WALLER, v. TEXAS
& PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 92.

Argued December 17, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.

Plaintiffs, as testamentary trustees, sought to hold the Texas & Pacific
Railway Company, as by an express trust, for the satisfaction of cer-,
tain bonds, part of an issue made under a deed of trust, in 1872, by'
the New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railway Company.
The deed purported to cover the right of way and aid lands, then
unearned, which had been granted to that company by ยง 22 of the
act creating the Texas & Pacific (Act of March 3, 1871, c. 122, 16
Stat. 573); and the contention, generally stated, was that the Texas
& Pacific, by succession to the benefits of the grant through a quitclaim made by the grantee, in 1881, to an intervening company,
by construction of the railroad by that company and by a practical
merger with it in that year, had become directly and expressly
liable-this in view of the terms of the deed of trust, of the act of
Congress and the instrument of consolidation, and the circumstances attending the transactions. When the suit began, in 1913,
the bonds were more than 10 years overdue, and interest had
been in default since 1876, or longer; the railroad had been owned
and operated by the Texas & Pacific since the merger; the aid lands
had been held, mortgaged and otherwise dealt with as the property
of the intervening company, subject to the merger agreement, and
the validity of the deed of trust of 1872 had been challenged in 1890,
and denied by a decree taken pro confesso against the trustee, which,
however, the plaintiffs here claimed was collusive, and not binding,
and not applicable to the right of way. The bonds in suit were
owned by plaintiffs' decedent for seven or eight years before his
death, but whether he was an original holder or purchaser did not
appear, nor was there any evidence concerning his notice or
knowledge. Held, without deciding the merits, that the suit, begun
in 1913, was barred by laches. For even if it be assumed that
under the deed of trust an action could not have been maintained for
the interest until the bonds matured in 1902, yet no attempt was

made to avail of a provision for the taking of possession by the
trustee, at request of any bondholder, for default of interest; and
furthermore the court may neither suppose nor indulge an ignorance
of the open activities of the companies and the long possession and
operation of the railroad by the defendant Held, further, that the
fact that the defendant had itself paid off most of the bonds issued
with plaintiffs' was immaterial in the absence of the reasons for
so doing; and that, in view of the magnitude of the recovery sought
(more than $100,000) and the long claim and operation of the property and expenditures upon it, the delay could not be excused upon
the assumption that defendant's position had not changed since
1881, when its liability, if any, accrued.
229 Fed. Rep. 87, affirmed.

SUIT to compel payment of thirty bonds issued by the
New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad Company under the circumstances hereinafter detailed. It
was originally brought against appellee and the New
Orleans Pacific Railroad Company and the Union Trust
Company of New York. The latter company was dismissed from the suit. No process was issued against the
New Orleans Pacific Railroad Company.
The bill presents the jurisdictional qualification of the
parties and the following facts, which we state narratively:
The New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad
Company, which we shall refer to as the Baton Rouge
Company, was incorporated December 30, 1869, by a
special act of the Louisiana legislature and was given the
usual powers to execute the purpose of its incorporation,
to borrow money and issue bonds, etc., and secure their
payment by a mortgage of its stock and franchises and
property which it then owned or might thereafter acquire.
The Texas & Pacific Railway Company, herein referred
to as the Texas & Pacific Company, was incorporated
March 3, 1871, by an Act of Congress (16 Stat. 573, c.
122), and was granted certain lands to aid in the construction of its road; and by a section of the act (ยง 22)
a grant was made to the Baton Rouge Company of the

same kind, that is, alternate sections of public lands per
mile, in the State of Louisiana, upon the condition that
the company complete the whole of the road within five
years of the passage of the act, the lands to be selected
on each side of its road on a route to be selected by the
company to connect with the Texas Pacific at the eastern
terminus of the latter, through the public land from New
Orleans to Baton Rouge and thence by the way of Alexandria. The company was empowered to mortgage the
lands.
September 4, 1872, it exercised the power and executed
a mortgage or deed of trust to the Union Trust Company
of New York, transferring and conveying, among other
things, all of its railroad and personal property and all
the right, title and interest it then had or it or its successors might acquire to the granted lands. The trust
company accepted of record its trusteeship.
The mortgage was intended to secure 12,000 bonds of
$1000 each, payable September 1, 1902, with interest at
7%, payable semiannually; 1,250 of the bonds were issued
and certified by the trustee.
Complainants, as executors and trustees of the estate
under the will of David J. Waller, who died in 1893, are
the owners and holders before maturity of 30 of the bonds
with 52 coupons attached thereto.
It was covenanted in the mortgage by the trustee thereof
that a sinking fund should be established and maintained
and an amount equal to 1% of the company's gross earnings, after certain deductions, and the proceeds of the
sales of the granted lands should be paid to the trustee
for the fund for the benefit of the bondholders. The
mortgage was duly recorded.
The railroad company accepted the grant and filed a
map of its general route from Baton Rouge to Shreveport
and a like map showing the general route from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The lands were then withdrawn

from entry and sale by the order of the Secretary of the
Interior. And under the terms of the grant the lands
vested in the company, subject only to the construction
of the road.
January 5, 1881, the Baton Rouge Company, by deed
of quitclaim, conveyed the lands to the New Orleans
Pacific Railroad Company, referred to herein as the New
Orleans Company, and its successors and assigns, and
thereafter the Baton Rouge Company no longer maintained its separate corporate existence and became merged
and consolidated with the New Orleans Company.
The conveyance and acceptance were filed by the New
Orleans Company in the Interior Department and the
Secretary of the Interior, under an opinion of the Attorney
General of the United States, recognized the New Orleans
Company and that the Baton Rouge Company had title
to the lands and could sell and assign the same.
On March 13, 1883, the Secretary of the Interior transmitted to the President a report of the examination of
260 miles of the road and recommended that they be
accepted and that patents be issued for such lands as
might have been earned by their construction by the
New Orleans Company, as assignee of the Baton Rouge
Company, the mortgagor thereof. The recommendation was approved and patents were issued to the New
Orleans Company, but solely as the assignee of the Baton
Rouge Company and as its grantee for 679,284.64 acres
of lands in Louisiana. The foregoing state of facts in
respect to the title of the lands was determined and adjudged in New Orleans Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States,
124 U. S. 124.
By an Act of Congress of February 8, 1887, c. 120, 24
Stat. 391, all lands which were not forfeited thereby were
relinquished, granted, conveyed and confirmed to the
New Orleans Company as assignee of Baton Rouge Company by the transfer above stated and title confirmed to

approximately 746,954 acres within the grant to the Baton
Rouge Company. At this time the New Orleans Company was and now is consolidated with and merged into
the Texas & Pacific Company.
Within six months after the conveyance to it by the
Baton Rouge Company the New Orleans Company transferred all of its property to the Texas & Pacific Company,
with the object and intention to merge the former with
the latter under the latter's name. The land grant acquired by the former company was expressly reserved
and its corporate organization was to be continued and
maintained until further authorized corporate action. In
addition to the lands patented to the amount of 679,284.64
acres to the New Orleans Company as assignee of the
Baton Rouge Company, other lands have been patented
to it amounting in 1917 to 1,001,000 acres, and the New
Orleans Company has since procured further patents and
filed applications for additional lands and still continues
to do so. The records of the Secretary of the Interior show
that there is a balance still due of more than 1,000,000
acres.
By the act incorporating the Texas & Pacific Company
(1871) it was provided that the property and franchises
acquired from each consolidated or purchased railroad
company or companies should vest and become absolutely the property of the Texas & Pacific Company,
subject, however, to all of the debts and obligations of
the acquired company or companies, and that the consolidation should not impair any lien which might exist
on any railroads so consolidated. It was provided 'that
there should be no consolidation with any competing
road and that the contracts and obligations of railroads*
consolidated should be liens upon the Texas & Pacific
Company.
From about the time of the organization of the New
Orleans Company, the Texas & Pacific Company con-

trolled it and still controls it, and by the recited acts and
transfers became charged with the lien of the mortgage
by the Baton Rouge Company to the Union Trust Company (September 4, 1872) and the other obligations of
the New Orleans Company, particularly the performance
of the covenants in the mortgage and the payment of the
bonds secured thereby. The organization of the companies -and merger in the Texas & Pacific Company and
transfer of the lands granted were all a part of a scheme
to secure from the United States the grant for the purpose
of raising money thereon by mortgages, and bonds secured thereby, to construct and equip a transcontinental
railway from New Orleans to the Pacific, as appears from
the act incorporating the Texas & Pacific Company (Act
of March 3, 1871).
The lands patented in the name of the New Orleans
Company were appropriated by the Texas & Pacific
Company, it continuing the other company in name for
the sole purpose of receiving patents, and controlling its
corporate books, accounts and records, the New Orleans
Company maintaining no corporate existence and having
no officers or directors (this on information and belief),
and the Texas & Pacific, in violation of the terms of the
covenants of the mortgage by the Baton Rouge Company
to the Union Trust Company and the trust thereby
created, has diverted the proceeds of the lands granted
from the use and purpose of the mortgage and in fraud
of complainants and the holders of bonds secured by the
mortgage to its own use and to the use of the New Orleans
Company and to other uses not authorized by the deed
of trust. The persons to whom the sales of the lands have
been made are so many that it is wholly impracticable
to enforce the lien of the mortgage, and have by occupation under the color of title acquired an impregnable
title thereto.
The Union Trust Company and certain bondholders

were made parties defendant in an action brought against
the Baton Rouge Company by the trustees under deeds
of trust of April 17, 1883, and January 5, 1884, executed
by the New Orleans Company, to declare them first liens
upon the lands described therein and to secure an issue
of bonds authorized thereby, and asking for judgment
that the deed of trust from the Baton Rouge Company
to the Union Trust Company (September 4, 1872) did
not affect or give any lien in or to the lands and that the
same be canceled. A decree pro confesso was entered so
declaring and adjudging.
The bondholders were dismissed from the case. The
attorneys for the complainants were attorneys for the
New Orleans Company and the Union Trust Company.
There were false allegations in the bill and the Union
Trust Company, though in duty bound as trustee to
defend the action and the trust created by the mortgage,
failed to do so, permitted the destruction of the lien and
permitted the New Orleans Company and the Texas &
Pacific Company to appropriate to themselves or to other
purposes the proceeds of the sales of the lands which were
at least worth $5.00 per acre.
The subject-matter of the suit exceeds $3,000 and the
complainants are without remedy at law.
Discovery is prayed of the quantity of lands patented,
the amount of sales and the proceeds thereof and that
the Union Trust Company and the Texas & Pacific Company account to complainants and to all other bondholders
similarly situated for all money and property received
from the enjoyment and sales of the lands to the extent of
their bonds and coupons and that they be adjudged to pay
complainants the amounts found due them.
The answer of the Texas & Pacific Company qualified
or denied certain of the averments of the bill and admitted
others. It set up the various acts of Congress referred
to in the bill and the transactions between the Texas &

Statement of the Case.

Pacific Company and the New Orleans Company, but
assigned a different cause and effect to them and to the
acts of Congress and to what was done under them. Its
defenses may be concentrated in four propositions stated
by counsel:
"1. That the Baton Rouge Company never acquired
title to the land grant lands, and that its alleged mortgage
of September 4, 1872, never became operative as a lien
thereon.
"2. That prosecution of the action is barred by the
decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Louisiana in the suit of Dillon and
Alexander against the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company and others.
"3. That the Texas and Pacific Railway Company is
in no way connected with the land grant or the transactions referred to in the complaint.
"4. That the suit is barred by limitations and by the
laches of the complainants."
Upon the issues thus formed, if it can be said there
are issues upon anything else but the characterization
and legal effect of the acts of Congress, the instruments
referred to and the transactions detailed, the District
Court expressed opinion that it was unable "to see how
any express trust ever existed in plaintiff's favor or in
favor of his decedent, except that created by the mortgage
to the Union Trust Company as trustee, the bounds and
limitations of which are set forth in the deed itself," which
instrument, the court said, was "in effect nothing more
or less than a mortgage, and to be treated as such." The
mortgage and debt, therefore, the court said, might be
enforced against the property at the situs of the latter,
but by this suit, the court said further, it was sought to
enforce the collection of the debt not from the property
mortgaged but from another corporation now alleged
to be personally liable for it. Such liability, the court

continued, could only result from some trust ex delicto
to be implied from some state of fact shown, and not upon
any direct undertaking by the New Orleans Company or
the Texas & Pacific Company to pay the debt of another,
to-wit, the Baton Rouge Company. Therefore, the court
concluded that its decision must turn upon either one or
both of the affirmative defenses made by the Texas &
Pacific Company, that is, either the statute of limitations or laches, or both.
Reciting that the bonds matured September 4, 1902,
and this suit was commenced May 7, 1913, the court
finally applied the statute of limitations of ten years
according to the law of New York and Louisiana. It,
however, expressed the view that the defense of laches
should be sustained and referred to O'Brien v. Wheelock,
184 U. S. 493, and dismissed the bill.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court,
but rested its decision upon the defense of laches, citing
therefor O'Brien v. Wheelock, supra, and saying: "The
proposition is somewhat startling that the holder of the
obligations of one corporation secured by a mortgage on
its property may maintain a suit forty years after the
date of such obligation and based thereon against another
corporation not a party thereto."
Mr. Jesse C. Adkins, with whom Mr. David Bennett
King, Mr. W. Russell Osborn, Mr. William A. Milliken,
Mr. C. C. Calhoun and Mr. Daniel B. Henderson were on
the briefs, for appellants.
Mr. Thomas J. Freeman for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the case as
above, delivered the opinion of the court.

To establish a trust against the Texas & Pacific Company it is argued that the purpose of the Act of Congress

WALLER v. TEXAS & PAC. RY. CO.
398.

Opinion of the Court.

of 1871 was to provide for the construction of a transcontinental railroad from Texas to San Diego, California,
and from thence to San Francisco by another company,
'and that the Baton Rouge Company, the New Orleans
Company and principally the Texas & Pacific Company
were instruments of that purpose; and the grant of the
Baton Rouge Company, by its mortgage to the Union
Trust Company, became charged with a lien for the payment of the bonds issued by the railroad company, which
lien followed the conveyance of the lands to the New
Orleans Company and to the Texas & Pacific Company;
and that besides there was a personal trust first in the
Union Trust Company and successively in the other
companies. And the argument is attempted to be fortified by ยง 4 of the Act of Congress of 1871 which authorized the Texas & Pacific Company to acquire other railroad corporations, and ยง 6, by which it was to become
responsible for the debts or obligations of any company
so acquired.
To sustain this contention the provisions of the various
instruments are adduced and their requirements, especially
that the bonds were entitled to the benefit and security
of a sinking fund to be set apart for their redemption
whereby the proceeds of all lands granted to the railroad
company (the Baton Rouge Company) were to be applied
to the payment of interest on the bonds and to their redemption and also 1% of the gross earnings of the company. And that the railroad and its equipment were
mortgaged for like purposes and all "the lands and sections of lands situate, lying and being on either side of
the said railroad, as the same may be finally located and
constructed, in accordance with and as granted by the
act of Congress" of March 3, 1871.
The mortgage to the Union Trust Company was in
trust for the purposes expressed above, and it was provided that, if default should be made in payment of inter-

est or of any payment to the sinking fund and continue
for the period of six months, or in default of any requirement of the mortgage, all of the bonds outstanding, at
the option of the holders of a majority in interest of such
outstanding bonds, should forthwith become due and
payable. And further, upon written request of the holders
of at least 1000 bonds then outstanding, the trustee should
foreclose the equity of redemption of the property embraced in the hypothecation; and at the request of a
bondholder might take possession of the road.
Sales of the lands were provided for and the disposition
of the proceeds, any balance remaining to be appropriated
to the purpose of the sinking fund. There was a covenant
by the company to pay on June 1, 1880, and on the first
of June of each succeeding year, a sum which should equal
one percentum of the gross earnings received by the road
from its operation twelve months immediately preceding,
which sum should be applied by the Trust Company or
its successors to the redemption of the bonds, and that
the Trust Company on the first days of January and July
of each and every year should designate by lot for redemption a number of bonds sufficient to equal, as near
as might be, the accumulations of the sinking fund and
cause a notice to be printed of such purpose.
It is contended that by reason of these provisions and
the facts detailed a trust was created that followed the
lands to whosesoever hands they reached, and each possessor of them became a trustee and bound with respect
to the property to the execution of the trust in the same
manner as the original trustee, the Union Trust Company,
was, citing for this result Ketchum v. City of St. Louis,
101 U. S. 306.
And by virtue of this principle the New Orleans Company is declared to have been a trustee and the lands
granted to it subject to the execution of the trust and the
Texas & Pacific Company has also become a trustee.

WALLER v. TEXAS & PAC. RY. CO.
398.

Opinion of the Court.

Another ground of liability is asserted against the latter
company. It has been consolidated, the contention is,
with the New Orleans Company and the latter has disappeared from sight and significance, leaving the Texas &
Pacific in sole responsibility. And yet the instrument of
consolidation expressly excepts "the lands and the land
grants acquired or to be acquired" by the New Orleans
Company from the United States, the State of Louisiana
or the Baton Rouge Company, or from any other source,
other than lands necessary or needful for railway purposes.
There is an express exemption and exclusion of such from
the provisions of the instrument of consolidation. And
it was provided that the corporate existefice of the New
Orleans Company should be maintained and its power
to carry out the existing contracts and to mortgage any
land grant it had acquired or might acquire from the
Baton Rouge Company or otherwise should remain unimpaired.
There is, therefore, some ground for the contention
of the Texas & Pacific Company that there is a want of
that privity of property which, according to the insistence
of appellant, is necessary to make that company trustee
of the Baton Rouge Company's mortgage of 1872, and
that ยงยง 4 and 6 of the act incorporating the Texas &
Pacific Company have not the meaning ascribed to them.
And further that the Baton Rouge Company never acquired any lands to which a lien could attach and that
the asserted trust had nothing upon which it could be
exercised, neither lands to sell nor railroad to take possession of and operate, both of which-sale of lands and
operation of road-were necessary to the execution of
the trust; and that it was so determined in a suit against
proper partieg by the decree of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
To this contention complainants reply: (1) The decree
was collusively obtained, (2) It did not cover the right

245 U. S.

of way and roadbed which, it is said, is admitted to have
come to the Texas and Pacific Company from the New
Orleans Company, (3) Independently of the deed of trust
and irrespective of it, the arrangement between those
companies was an attempt to conserve the subordinate
rights and interests of the stockholders of the Baton
Rouge Company at the expense of its creditors; an attempt, it is insisted, always judicially condemned. Cases
are cited, among others, Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Boyd,
228 U. S. 482.
The argument to sustain or oppose the respective contentions we need not recite. They have indication in the
pleadings and, it may be, in what we have already said.
We rest our decision on the defense of laches, which, we
think, has been sustained.
In 1872 the Baton Rouge Company executed the instrument the particular trusts of which are now attempted
to be enforced. Before that time it had filed a map of
general route but no map of definite location; but after
that time the record discloses nothing done by it until
1881, when it conveyed the lands to the New Orleans
Company.
The activities of the New Orleans Company are shown,
and through and by what struggles it was enabled to
construct the road. The record shows assertion of rights
by some of the bondholders, but also shows that the assertion was met by challenge of legality and judicially determined against. During all that time, during all of
the notoriety of the transactions detailed, the owner or
owners of the bonds in suit made no claim by word or
act and now, over ten years after their maturity and
forty years after their issue, a claim of personal liability
is made against the Texas & Pacific Company. It is to

be borne in mind that the interest on the bonds has always been in default, certainly since 1876, and there was

remedy provided for such default. At the instance of

WALLER v. TEXAS & PAC. RY. CO.
398.

Opinion of the Court.

any holder of the bonds the trustee could have taken
possession of the road and if of the Baton Rouge Road
then of its successors in liability, the New Orleans and
the Texas & Pacific companies, for if they were successors in liability they were successively subject to the
remedy. If it be said that such remedy was extreme and
inconvenient, it had potency as a threat in the hands of a
diligent creditor, and, besides, if there was a successive
personal liability it accrued against the New Orleans Company in 1881 and the Texas & Pacific Company in 1881.
The delay is attempted to be excused. It is said action
for nonpayment of interest could only be taken by the
holders of 1000 or a majority of bonds outstanding, and
that it appears the Texas & Pacific Company had acquired 1183 of the 1275 bonds which were outstanding.
It is hence contended that complainants' testate could
not have been guilty of laches before his death and that
the present complainants could not act until the maturity
of the bonds in 1902. It is further said that complainants
filed a bill in 1908 in the United States District Court in
Louisiana to .collect the bonds and that until the filing
of the answer in that case complainants were ignorant
of the merger of the New Orleans and the Texas & Pacific
companies or of the suit filed in 1890 to remove the cloud
of the asserted lien of the mortgage of the Baton Rouge
Company to the Union Trust Company of 1872.
But what complainants' testate knew does not appear
and whether he was an original holder or a purchaser,
except that it was thought he owned the bonds for seven
or eight years before his death. And the ignorance of
complainants is extraordinary in view of their interest,
if it was an attentive interest. If we may suppose ignorance of records we cannot suppose, certainly not indulge,
an ignorance of the open activities of the companies and
the possession and operation of the railroad by the Texas
& Pacific Company.

It is again said in excuse that it does not appear that
the Texas & Pacific Company has changed its position,
which it is said is the same as it was in 1881, and that it
has even realized the benefit of the trust and so far executed it as to pay before 1890 most of the bonds. Why
those bonds were paid or acquired and upon what motive
does not appear, and it cannot be said that a company
which has been in possession of and operating a great
property for many years, having spent large sums of
money upon it, in the belief of having a clear and unincumbered right, is inequitably unaffected by a claim
against it, asserted as a result of remote transactions with
which it had no connection. And certainly it may be
urged that it would surprise and strain any condition to
be suddenly called upon to pay $107,700.00, that sum
being the amount of principal and interest (7%) of complainants' demand.

No. 106.

Argued December 20, 21, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.

While a husband and wife, domiciled in Texas, were temporarily in
Illinois, the former executed his note and the latter her continuing,
guaranty of payment. Assuming that the guaranty would have
been enforced in Illinois, held, that comity did not call for
its enforcement by the courts of Texas, against the wife's separate property there, if contrary to the public policy of Texas; for
it is one thing for a court to decline to be an instrument for depriving citizens belonging to the jurisdiction of their property in ways
not intended by the law that governs them, another to deny its
