and unreasonable or without proper relation to the legitimate legislative purpose.
We further think it clearly follows from our numerous
decisions upholding prohibition legislation that the right
to hold intoxicating liquors for personal use is not one of
those fundamental privileges of a citizen of the United
States which no State may abridge. A contrary view
would be incompatible with the undoubted power to prevent manufacture, gift, sale, purchase or transportation

of such articles-the only feasible ways of getting them.

An assured right of possession would necessarily imply
some adequate method to obtain not subject to destruction
at the will of the State.

DUNCAN TOWNSITE COMPANY v. LANE, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.
ERROR TO

THE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.

No. 51.

Argued November 15, 1917.-Decided December 10, 1917.

An allotment certificate issued under the Choctaw-Chickasaw agreement of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641, passes the equitable title
only; the legal title remains in the United States until conveyed by
patent, duly recorded, as provided by § 5 of the Act of April 26,
1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, and the allotment in the meantime is
subject to be set aside, by the Secretary of the Interior, for fraudulent procurement.
The doctrine of bona fide purchase will not aid the holder of an equity
to overcome the holder of both the legal title and an equity.
Mandamus is a discretionary remedy, largely controlled by equitable
principles; it will not be granted to promote a wrong-to direct an
act which will work public or private mischief, or which, whil within

the letter, disregards the spirit of the law. So held where the relator,
purchaser in good faith and without notice of a fraudulent Indian
allotment, sought to get in the legal title as against the United States
by compelling the Secretary of the Interior to issue and record a
patent.

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles H. Merillat, with whom Mr. Charles T.
Kappler was on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful for defendant
in error.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the,
court.
This is a petition for a writ of mandamus brought in
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to compel
the Secretary of the Interior to restore the name of Nicholas Alberson, deceased, to the rolls under the ChoctawChickasaw Agreement of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 641), and
to execute and record a patent for land described in an
allotment certificate issued in his name by the Dawes
Commission.
Under that act only the names of persons alive September 25, 1902, were entitled to entry on the rolls. Alberson
had died before that date. The entry of his name and the
issue of the certificate were procured by fraud and perjury.
These facts, now conceded, were established by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes; and the Secretary of
the Interior upon recommendation of the Commission
removed Alberson's name from the rolls, held the certificates for cancellation and allotted the land to others.
Notice of the hearing before the Commission was given to
Alberson's administrator and attorney of record, but not

to the relator, who had, under the Oklahoma law, recorded
the deed assigning the certificates and was in actual possession of the premises. The certificates had issued on or
before April 7, 1906. The notation removing Alberson's
name from the rolls was made January 11, 1908. The relator purchased the certificates before January 11, 1908,
for value in good faith without knowledge of the fraud or
notice of the proceedings for cancellation hereinbefore referred to. The Supreme Court entered judgment for the
relator, commanding issue and record of the patent, but
making no order in respect to restoring Alberson's name
to the rolls. The relator acquiesced in the judgment; but
on writ of error sued out by respondent the judgment was
reversed by the Court of Appeals (44 App. D. C. 63); and
,the relator brings the case here on writ of error.
The nature of the Choctaw-Chickasaw Agreement 1
and the rights incident to enrollment and allotment have
been frequently considered by this court. Enrollment
confers rights which cannot be taken away without notice
and opportunity to be heard. Garfield v. Goldsby, 211
U. S. 249. Certificates of allotment, like receiver's receipts under the general land laws, entitle the holder to
exclusive possession of the premises; Act of July 1, 1902,
§ 23, 32 Stat. 641-644; United States v. Detroit Lumber Co.,
200 U. S. 321, 337-8. But enrollment and certificates may
be cancelled by the Secretary of the Interior for fraud or
mistake, Lowe v. Fisher, 223 U. S. 95; because although
the equitable title had passed, Michigan Land and Lumber
Co. v. Rust, 168 U. S. 589, 593, the land remains subject
to the supervisory power of the Land Department,
Knight v. Lane, 228 U. S. 6, until issue of the patent,
United States v. Wildcat, 244 U. S. 111, unless under the
statute the power expires earlier by lapse of time. Bali See, e. g., Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445; Woodward v.
de Grafenried, 238 U. S. 284.

Opinion of the Court.

linger v. Frost, 216 U. S. 240. Under § 5 of the Act of
April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, the legal title can
be conveyed only by a patent duly recorded. Brown v.
Hitchcock, 173 U. S. 473, 478. The provision in § 23 of
the Act of July 1, 1902, that "allotment certificates
issued by the Commission to the Five Civilized tribes
shall be conclusive evidence of the right of any allottee
to the tract of land described therein" has relation to
rights between the holder and third parties. The title
conferred by the allotment is an equitable one, so that
supervisory power remained in the Secretary of the Interior.
We are not required to decide whether (as suggested in
Lowe v. Fisher, 223 U. S. 95, 107) the power to remove
Alberson's name from the rolls had, because of § 2 of the
Act of April 26, 1906, expired before the Secretary
acted. For the Supreme Court of the District did
not order the name restored, and its judgment was
acquiesced in by the relator. The claim which te relator
makes in this court rests wholly upon the fact that
the relator was a bona fide purchaser for value. But the
doctrine of bona fide purchaser for value applies only to
purchasers of the legal estate. Hawley v. Diller, 178 U. S.
476, 484. It "is in no respect a rule of property, but a rule
of inaction." Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, § 743. It
is a shield by which the purchaser of a legal title may protect himself against the holder of an equity, not a sword
by which the owner of an equity may overcome the holder
of both the legal title and an equity. Boone v. Chiles, 10
Pet. 177, 210.
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedial process which
is awarded, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of
a sound judicial discretion. It issues to remedy a wrong,
not to promote one; to compel the performance of a duty
which ought to be performed, not to direct an act which
will work a public or private mischief or will be within the

strict letter of the law but in disregard of its spirit. Although classed as a legal remedy, its issuance is largely
controlled by equitable principles. 1 The relator having
itself only an equity seeks the aid of the court to clothe
it with the legal title as against the United States, which
now holds both the legal title and the equity to have set
aside an allotment certificate secured by fraud. A writ
of mandamus will not be granted for such a purpose. See
Turner v. Fisher, 222 U. S. 204. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

HULL, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF PALMER,
v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST COMPANY ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 66.

Argued November 19, 1917.-Decided December 10, 1917.

A New York testator bequeathed a fund in trust to pay the income to
his son during life, with remainder over to others, subject to the condition that the principal also be paid to the son whenever he became
able to pay his just debts and liabilities from other resources-a condition recognized as valid by the law of New York. The son secured
his discharge in bankruptcy, whereupon the principal was paid over
to him by order of the Surrogate Court. Held, that no right to the
principal passed to his trustee in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy
Act, § 70a (5).
155 App. Div. 636; 213 N. Y. 315, affirmed.
