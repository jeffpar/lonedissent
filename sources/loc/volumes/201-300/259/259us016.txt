BAILEY, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE,
ET AL. v. GEORGE, TRADING AND DOING
BUSINESS AS VIVIAN COTTON MILLS, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.
No. 590.

Argued March 7, 8, 1922.-Decided May 15, 1922.

A bill to enjoin a levy and sale of property to satisfy a penalty
prescribed as a tax by an unconstitutional act of Congress,
will not lie, in face of the inhibition of Rev. Stats., § 3224, when
it sets up no extraordinary circumstances rendering that section
inapplicable and exhibits no reason why the legal remedy of payment under protest and action to recover would not be adequate.
P. 19.
274 Fed. 639, reversed.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court permanently enjoining a collector and his deputy from collecting an assessment under the Federal Child Labor Tax
Law. See also Child Labor Tax Case, post, 20.
Mr. Solicitor General Beck, with whom Mr. Robert P.
Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was
on the brief, for appellants, attacked the jurisdiction of
the lower court, citing Rev. Stats., § 3224, and contending that the imposition in question was a tax within the
meaning of that section, whether unconstitutional or not;

that there were no extraordinary circumstances justifying
interposition in equity, and that the policy of the law
confined the remedy to an action for refund.
Mr. W. Cleveland Davis and Mr. Campbell B. Fetner
for appellees.
The purpose of § 3224, Rev. Stats., is that the Government shall not be delayed in the collection of its revenue.
The statute relates to exactions properly called taxesthat is, exactions for the purpose of raising revenue with
which to run the Government. Barnes v. The Railroads,
17 Wall. 307; Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U. S. 118; Dodge v.
Brady, 240 U. S. 122.
The Child Labor Law does not levy a tax within the
meaning of that term. Its purpose is not to raise revenue
with which to run the Government. Looking only at the
statute itself one must conclude that it is more in its
direct and necessary result-in its natural and reasonable
effect-a regulation of the hours of labor permitted in
factories and mines. It is not a tax at all, but is an
attempt by Congress to exert a power as to a purely local
matter, to which the federal authority does not extend.
Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U. S. 254;
New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483, 492.
Clearly the tax in question is not levied upon person
nor upon property. Is it, then, a privilege tax? Would
a reasonable mind, upon reading the statute, conclude
that Congress meant to collect the tax upon the theory
that it was extending to the manufacturer the privilege
of employing children under the prohibited age? McBride v. Adams, 70 Miss. 716. See Thorne v. Lynch, 269
Fed. 995; Accardo v. Fontenst, 269 Fed. 447; Kaush v.
Moore, 268 Fed. 668.
That no revenue was intended to be raised by the Child
Labor Act, but that it was intended to exert a power as
to a purely local matter, to which the federal authority

did not extend and to penalize or fine the manufacturer
for his failure to comply with the will of Congress, is
shown by the discussion in the Senate. 57 Cong. Rec.
619, 620, 626.
The propositions laid down in Hammer v. Dagenhart,
247 U. S. 251, should apply equally to all grants of power
under the Constitution, including the power to tax, unless, forsooth, there are no constitutional barriers against
the powers of taxation, and Congress may be allowed
under the guise of taxation to exert any influence upon
matters purely local, at the congressional will, and those
affected are to be deprived of their ordinary remedies and
rights in courts of justice.
This Child Labor statute being a criminal or penalizing
statute over matters of which Congress has no control, it
is condemned by the principles announced by this court
in cases in which taxing statutes have been upheld. •McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27. No revenue was
contemplated and none raised.
It will be noted that the act itself does not expressly
provide for a collection of a tax by a warrant of distraint.
In the absence of such provision, the usual method of
collecting a penalty is by suit or other appropriate proceedings in court. 22 Cyc. 1680; 30 Cyc. 645; Lees v.
!UnitedStates, 150 U. S. 479.
Notwithstanding the inhibition of § 3224, the courts
hold that the collection of the tax should be restrained if
the enforcement of the tax would produce irreparable
injury, or other circumstances justify equitable relief.
Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 114 U. S. 311;
Cummings v. National Bank, 101 U. S. 153; Poindexter
v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 270. See also, State Railroad Tax
Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 614; Hannewinkle v. Georgetown,
15 Wall. 547; Shelton v. Platt, 139 U. S. 591.
The petition alleges that a forced sale now would produce irreparable loss, because of depressed market con-

ditions. Under this and other allegations and admissions,
this is a case in which a court of equity may enjoin the
collection of the tax in spite of § 3224. Snyder v. Marks,
109 U. S. 189; Cheatham v. United States, 92 U. S. 85;
State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575; Dodge v. Osborn,
240 U. S. 118.
The Child Labor Tax being admittedly not for the
purpose of raising revenue but for the purpose of regulating child labor, and no revenue being contemplated by
the act, the reason for the application of § 3224 fails.
MR. CHIEF JusTIcE TAFT delivered the opinion of the
court.
The decree entered herein by the District Court and appealed from, directly, to this court, under § 238 of the
Judicial Code, recited that the complainants operated a
manufacturing plant for the production of cotton goods in
Gaston County, North Carolina; that the defendant was
a Federal Collector of Internal Revenue; that on the
ground that complainants had employed children in their
factory within the limits of ages prescribed in § 1200 of
the act of Congress, known as the Child Labor Tax Law,
approved February 24, 1919, c. 18,40 Stat. 1057, 1138, they
were under its terms assessed the sum of $2,098.06; that
they filed a claim for abatement of the same, which was
denied, that the Collector was about to make the exaction
by distraining complainants' property, levying on it and
selling it, that the act of Congress purporting to authorize
the assessment was invalid under the Constitution of the
United States, and on these grounds permanently enjoined the Collector from proceeding to collect the assessment.
An examination of the bill shows no other ground for
equitable relief than as stated in the order. The bill does
aver "That these your petitioners have exhausted all
legal remedies and it is necessary for them to be given

20

equitable relief in the premises "; but there are no specific
facts set forth sustaining this mere legal conclusion. Section 3224, Rev. Stats., provides that "No suit for the
purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any
tax shall be maintained in any court." The averment
that a taxing statute is unconstitutional does not take this
case out of the section. There must be some extraordinary and exceptional circumstance not here averred or
shown to make the provisions of the section inapplicable.
Dodge v. Brady, 240 U. S. 122, 126. In spite of their
averment, the complainants did not exhaust all their legal

remedies. They might have paid the amount assessed
under protest and then brought suit against the Collector
to recover the amount paid with interest. No fact is
alleged which would prevent them from availing themselves of this form of remedy.
The decree of the District Court is reversed and the
cause remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.
Reversed.

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.

No. 657. Argued March 7, 8, 1922.-Decided May 15, 1922.
1. An act of Congress which clearly, on its face, is designed to
penalize, and thereby to discourage or suppress, conduct the regulation of which is reserved by the Constitution exclusively to the
States, can not be sustained under the federal taxing power by
calling the penalty a tax. P. 37. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall.

Co., 220 U. S.107; and United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S.86,
