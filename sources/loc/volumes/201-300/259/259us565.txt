OKLAHOMA v. TEXAS.
557.

Syllabus.

which is unconstitutional, legal remedies are available;
and there is, therefore, lack of jurisdiction in equity. We
have here, at the worst, the case of a threatened distraint
which it is contended will be wrongful if made; a case not
differing in substance from wrongful distraint by landlords or other wrongful distraint by tax collectors; and
not differing in substance from wrongful attachment. In
all these cases, as has long been settled, the owner of the
property of which seizure is threatened is not entitled to
relief in equity, unless it appears that there is no plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law.
Whether the action of the Government is lawful depends upon the construction of a statute; and on this
question the lower courts have differed. As was said by
this court in Arkansas Building & Loan Association v.
Madden, 175 U. S. 269, 274: "It is quite possible that
in cases of this sort the validity of a law may be more
conveniently tested, by the party denying it, by a bill in
equity than by an action at law; but considerations of
that character, while they may explain, do not justify, resort to that mode of proceeding." If the Government is
proceeding without warrant in law, the plaintiff should,
of course, have redress. An early determination of the
constitutional question presented would be desirable.
But, in my opinion, we cannot properly decide it in this
case.

part are only such as are incidental to her ownership of lands on
the northerly bank.
The federal mining laws have never applied to the parts of the river
bed lying within and south of the Indian pasture reserve formerly
called the Big Pasture.
Certain petitions of intervention claiming under lease from Oklahoma,
or based on locations made under the mining laws, are dismissed.

Decree adjudicating proprietary claims to land in the
bed of Red River, in accordance with the opinion reported
in 258 U. S. 574.
Certain issues in this cause involving proprietary claims
to the bed of Red River having been heretofore submitted
on the pleadings, various petitions of intervention and the
evidence taken before and reported by a commissioner,
and the court having considered those issues and announced its conclusions thereon in an opinion delivered
May 1, 1922:
It is considered, ordered and decreed as follows:
1. That Red River is not a navigable stream in any part
of its course within the State of Oklahoma.
2. That the State of Oklahoma did not in virtue of her
admission into the Union as a State acquire any title to,
or become the owner of, the bed of the part of Red River
within her borders.
3. That the State of Oklahoma has no title, right or
interest in or to the part of the bed of Red River within
her borders, save such as is incidental to her ownership
of lands on the northerly bank of the river.
4. That the intervener D. D. Brunson, who claims
rights in the bed of Red River in virtue of certain oil and
gas leases granted by the State of Oklahoma and her
officers, did not acquire and does not hold any right whatever in such river bed under those leases or any of them,
and that the said leases have been at all times void and
of no force or effect.

5. That the portion of the bed of Red River which
formerly was within what was known and designated as
Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Pasture Reserve Number
One (commonly called the Big Pasture), and the portion

was known and designated as such pasture reserve, has not
at any time been subject to location or acquisition under
the mining laws of the United States.
6. That the several interveners hereafter named in
this paragraph, who are asserting rights in the portions
of the bed of Red River named in the last preceding paragraph in virtue of mining locations claimed to have been
made under the mining laws of the United States, did not
acquire and do not hold any right whatever in such river
bed under those mining locations or any of them, and that
the said miding locations have been at all times void and
of no force or effect. The said interveners are as follows:
