APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

Nos. 750, 751, 752, 753, 832, 833, 844, 845. Argued April 28, 1922-Decided May 15, 1922.
1. Conclusions of a master and the District Court that the eightycent gas rate fixed by c. 125, New York Laws 1906, had become
confiscatory, sustained. P. 103. See Newton v. Consolidated Gas
Co., 2.58 U. S. 165.
2. In fixing the fees of a master, the District Court, under Equity
Rule 68, enjoys a judicial discretion, but subject to review in case
of abuse. P. 104.
3. The compensation of a master should be adequate to the work
done, time employed and responsibility assumed-liberal, but not
exorbitant; salaries prescribed for judicial officers performing similar duties are valuable guides in fixing it, but a higher rate is generally necessary. P. 105
4. Held, that the compensation allowed in these eases was excessive.
P. 105.
Reversed.

Mr. William Schuyler Jackson, with whom Mr. John P.

753.
Mr. Judson Hyatt, with whom Mr. Charles D. Newton,
Attorney General of the State of New York, Mr. Wilber
W. Chambers, Mr. Clarence R. Cummings, Mr. John P.
O'Brien, Mr. James A. Donnelly and Mr. Harry Hertzoif

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
court.
These are appeals in separate but related causes wherein the Consolidated Gas Company of New York and certain of its subsidiary and affiliated corporations alleged
that the maximum selling rate for gas prescribed by c.
125, Laws of New York, 1906, was confiscatory and asked
that its enforcement be enjoined.

Opinion of the Court.

York & Queens Gas Co., were disposed of upon former
appeals decided March 6, 1922, 258 U. S. 165, 178. By
supplemental decrees the court below undertook to fix the
master's compensation. From them appeals Nos. 750
and 751 were taken. They are discussed below.
Appeals Nos. 752, 753, 832, 833, 844 and 845 bring up
final decrees which declare the maximum rate prescribed
by c. 125, supra, confiscatory. Compensation allowed to
the master is considered later. Concerning the merits
little need be said. In each cause the controverted questions of fact were referred to a master, who took evidence
and made reports supporting appellees' claims, and these
were confirmed by the court. We are entirely satisfied
with the ultimate conclusions; and none of the points relied upon are sufficient to justify general reversals. See
Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., supra.
The Attorney General and the Public Service Commission of New York were defendants in the eight cases;
the District Attorney of New York County was defendant
in Nos. 750, 832, 833, 844 and 845; the District Attorney
of the County of Bronx in Nos. 752, 753 and 833; and the
District Attorney of the County of Queens in Nos. 751
and 845.
By separate orders A. S. Gilbert, Esquire, was appointed
master in all of the causes and directed to take proof and
report. His compensation and disbursements were determined and allowed by timely decrees entered in December, 1921, after all his reports had come in, and evidently upon a view of the whole litigation. It was also
ordered that such sum "shall be paid in the first instance
by the complainant and shall be taxed as costs to be paid
equally by the defendants." The disbursements are not
questioned; but the several allowances for compensation
are challenged as excessive and unreasonable.
No appeal has been taken by the Public Service Commission or by any of the gas companies (complainants

below) from the orders touching the matter of compensation.
Detailed statements filed by the master show the nature
and responsibility of his duties, the number of hours
occupied on specified dates in hearings, preparing opinions,
etc., etc., with the equivalent number of days, reckoned
at five hours each. It appears: That he was appointed
in Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., May 16, 1919, and
by subsequent decrees in the other causes; that 192 days
(five hours) were devoted to the cause wherein the Consolidated Gas Co. was complainant-No. 750-and $57,500
allowed as compensation therefor; that 30 days were devoted to the cause wherein the New York & Queens Gas
Co. was complainant-No. 751-and $12,500 allowed as
compensation; that 22 days were given to cause No. 752
and $12,500 allowed as compensation; 8 days to cause No.
753 and $7,500 allowed as compensation; 9 days to cause
No. 832 and $11,500 allowed as compensation; 7 days to
cause No. 833 and $7,500 allowed as compensation; 7
days to cause No. 844 and $4,500 allowed as compensation; and 7 days to cause No. 845 and $4,500 allowed as
compensation. The eight causes occupied two hundred
and eighty-two (282) "days of five hours each based on
the average court day in this district "; the total allowed
compensation is $118,000. He began to hold hearings
July 22, 1919; separate reports were submitted May 6,
1920, July 19, 1920, February 16, 1921, and (the final
ones) July 29, 1921. The record in the Consolidated Gas
Co. case (No. 750) is very large-20,000 printed pages;
in the New York and Queens Gas Co. case (No. 751) it
is approximately 2,000 pages, and in the remaining six
cases the records contain from 1417 to 2929 pages.
Equity Rule 68 provides---" The district courts may
appoint a master pro hac vice in any particular
case. The compensation to be allowed to every master
shall be fixed by the district court, in its discretion, hay-

ing regard to all the circumstances thereof, and the compensation shall be charged upon and borne by such of the
parties in the cause as the court shall direct." Discretion
within intendment of the rule is a judicial one; it does
not extend to arbitrary and unreasonable action; and our
review is limited to the question of its improvident exercise.
The value of a capable master's services can not be determined with mathematical accuracy; and estimates will
vary, of course, according to the standard adopted. He
occupies a position of honor, responsibility and trust; the
court looks to him to execute its decrees thoroughly, accurately, impartially and in full response to the confidence
extended; he should be adequately remunerated for
actual work done, time employed and the responsibility
assumed. His compensation should be liberal, but not
exorbitant. The rights of those who ultimately pay must
be carefully protected; and while salaries prescribed by
law for judicial officers performing similar duties are valuable guides, a higher rate of compensation is generally
necessary in order to secure ability and experience in an
exacting and temporary employment which often seriously interferes with other undertakings. See Finance
Committee of Pennsylvaniav. Warren, 82 Fed. 525, 527;
Middleton v. Bankers' & Merchants' Tel. Co., 32 Fed.
524, 525.

Having regard to these general principles and the
special value of knowledge possessed by the trial court,
much weight must be given to its opinion. Ordinarily
we may not substitute our judgment for its deliberate
conclusions, nor interfere with the exercise of its discretion. But when that court falls into error which amounts
to abuse of discretion and the cause comes here by proper
proceedings, appropriate relief must be granted.
Notwithstanding protracted, painstaking and for the
most part excellent services rendered by the master and
the large amounts involved in these causes, after viewing

the records and considering the circumstances disclosed,
we cannot doubt that the allowances are much too largecertainly twice and three times what they should be. If
the time devoted to the entire service-282 days-be accepted as equivalent to one year, the total allowance is
fifteen times the salary of the trial judge and eight times
that received by justices of this court. It may be compared to the compensation of the Mayor of New York
City-$15,000, the salaries of the Governor and members
of the Court of Appeals of New York-10,000, and the
$17,500 paid to judges of the Supreme Court in the City
of New York. Although none of these can be taken as
a rigid standard, they are to be considered when it becomes necessary to determine what shall be paid to an
attorney called to assist the court. His duties are not
more onerous or responsible than those often performed
by judges.
So far as the several deorees undertake to adjudicate
the master's compensation they will be reversed and the
causes remanded with instructions to fix the same within
the following limitations: In the cause wherein the Consolidated Gas Company is appellee here (No. 750) not
exceeding $28,750-one-half of the amount heretofore
allowed; in each of the other seven causes, Nos. 751, 752,
753, 832, 833, 844 and 845, not exceeding one-third of
the amount heretofore allowed therein; and in the eight
cases allowances totaling not more than $49,250. Such
further action in conformity with this opinion as may be
necessary shall also be taken.
Appellants will pay the costs of appeals Nos. 750 and
751 with the right to claim credit therefor upon any judgment hereafter entered against them on account of the
master's compensation. The costs in the remaining
causes will be taxed against the appellants.
Reversed.
