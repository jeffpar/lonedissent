state statutes. Consequently, when the Compensation Act
superseded other state laws touching the liability in question, it did not come into coiflict with any superior maritime law. And this is true whether awards under the act
are made as upon implied agreements or otherwise. The
stevedore's contract of employment did not contemplate
any dominant federal rule concerning the master's liability
for personal injuries received on land. In Jensen's case,
rights and liabilities were definitely fixed by maritime
rules, whose uniformity was essential. With these the
local law came into conflict. Here no such antagonism
exists. There is no pertinent federal statute; and application of the local law will not work material prejudice to
any characteristic feature of the general maritime law.

Opinion of the Court.

3. A Chinese person thus unlawfully in the United States is subject
to executive deportation under the General Immigration Act of
February 5, 1917, § 19, without giving it a retroactive effect,
although he entered the country before it was passed, because the
act applies to any alien who "shall be found" here in violation
of any federal law, as well as those who shall have entered unlawfully. P. 280.
4. Persons of Chinese blood who have been admitted into the country
by the immigration authorities and afterwards arrested and held
for deportation, who claim to be citizens of the United States in
virtue of the citizenship of their father (Rev. Stats. § 1993,) and
who support the claim by evidence both before the immigration
officers and upon petition for habeas corpus, are entitled, under
the Fifth Amendment, to a judicial hearing of the claim, in the
habeas corpus proceeding. P. 282.

The petitioners, Chinese held for deportation under
warrants issued by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to
the Immigration Act of 1917, obtained from the District
Court a writ of habeas corpus. That court subsequently
ordered the writ quashed and the petitioners remanded
to custody. The present review is directed to a judgment
of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the action of
the District Court as to all of the petitioners except one
whom it ordered released.

of California. A writ issued directed to the Commissioner
of Immigration for the Port of San Francisco, who held
the petitioners in custody under warrants of deportation
of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to § 19 of the General
Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874,
889. The case was heard upon the original files of the
Bureau of Immigration containing the record of the deportation proceedings. Each petitioner had entered the
United States before May 1, 1917, the effective date of
the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, and
within five years of the commencement of the deportation
proceedings. As to each the warrant of deportation recited that the petitioner was a native of China, was found
to have secured his admission by fraud, and was found
within the United States in violation of § 6 of the Chinese
Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892, c. 60, 27 Stat. 25, as
amended by the Act of November 3, 1893, c. 14, 28 Stat. 7,
being a Chinese laborer not in possession of a certificate
of residence. The District Court entered an order quashing the writ and remanding the prisoners to the custody
of the immigration authorities. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, except as to one appellant who was ordered released,

There is a faint contention, which we deem unfounded,
that the petitioners were not given a fair hearing and that
there is no evidence to sustain the findings of the immigration official. The contention mainly urged is that any

Opinion of the Court.

tioners may be guilty occurred prior to the effective date
of the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917; that,
consequently, petitioners were not subject to its provision
authorizing deportation on executive orders; and that under the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Acts they
could be deported only upon judicial proceedings. In
certain respects the situation of two of the petitioners
differs from that of the other two; and, to that extent,
their rights require separate consideration.
First. As to Ng Fung Ho and Ng Yuen Shew, his minor
son, the question presented is solely one of statutory construction. Deportation under provisions of the Chinese
Exclusion Acts can be had only upon judicial proceedings;
that is, upon a warrant issued by a justice, judge or commissioner of a United States court upon a complaint and
returnable before such court, or a justice, judge or commissioner thereof. From an order of deportation entered
by a Commissioner an appeal is provided to the District
Court and from there to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
United States, Petitioner, 194 U. S. 194. We held in
United States v. Woo Jan, 245 U. S. 552, that § 21 of the
General Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134,
34 Stat. 898, which authorized deportation of aliens on
executive orders, did.not apply to violators of the Chinese
Exclusion Acts and that they continued to enjoy the right
to a judicial hearing. The 1907 Act remained in force
until May 1, 1917, when the General Immigration Act of
February 5, 1917, became operative. Section 19 of the
latter act also provides for deportation of aliens on executive orders. The question is: Did the Act of 1917 also
preserve to Chinese the exceptional right to a judicial
hearing as distinguished from an executive hearing?
Petitioners practically concede that Chinese who first
entered the United States after April 30, 1917, are subject
to deportation under the provisions of § 19; but they insist
that the rights and liabilities of those who entered before

280

259 U. S.

May 1, 1917, are governed wholly by the Chinese Exclusion Acts; and that these remain entitled to a judicial
hearing. The mere fact that at the time petitioners last entered the United States they could not have been deported
except by judicial proceedings presents no constitutional
obstacle to their expulsion by executive order now.
Neither Ng Fung Ho nor Ng Yuen Shew claims to be a
citizen of the United States. Congress has power to order
at any time the deportation of aliens whose presence in
the country it deems hurtful; and may do so by appropriate executive proceedings. Bugajewitz v. Adams, 228
U. S. 585; Lapina v. Williams, 232 U. S. 78; Lewis v.
Frick, 233 U. S. 291. Our task, therefore, so far as concerns these two petitioners, is merely to ascertain the intention of Congress.
Petitioners argue that to hold § 19 of the 1917 Act applicable to them would give it retroactive operation contrary to the expressed intention of Congress. They rely
particularly on the clauses in § 38 which declare that "as
to all . . .acts, things, or matters," "done or existing
at the time of the taking effect of this [1917] Act" the
"laws

.

. . amended . . . are hereby continued in

force." 1 The Government, on the other hand, insists that
'Section 19 provides for taking into custody upon warrant of the
Secretary of Labor, and deportation, of "any alien who shall have
entered or who shall be found in the United States in violation of
this Act, or in violation of any other law of the United States."
The third proviso of § 19 reads:
"That the provisions of this section, with the exceptions hereinbefore noted, shall be applicable to the classes of aliens therein mentioned irrespective of the time of their entry into the United States."
Section 38 specifically repeals the existing law upon the taking
effect of the act and continues:
"Provided, That this Act shall not be construed to repeal, alter,
or amend existing laws relating to the immigration or exclusion of
Chinese persons . . . except as provided in section nineteen
hereof: . . . Provided further, That nothing contained in this Act

NG FUNG HO v. WHITE.
276.

Opinion of the Court.

§ 19 was intended to operate retroactively and to cover
acts done prior to its going into effect, provided deportation proceedings were begun within five years after entry.
But its main contention rests upon the fact that here the
arrest and deportation are based, not merely upon unlawful entry, but upon the unlawful remaining of the petitioners after May 1, 1917. For the charge as to each is,
"that he has been found within the United States in violation of section 6, Chinese Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892,
as amended by the Act of November 3, 1893, being a Chinese laborer not in possession of a certificate of residence."
Unlawful remaining of an alien in the United States is
an offense distinct in its nature from unlawful entry into
the United States. One who has entered lawfully may remain unlawfully. This is expressly recognized in § 6 of
the Act of May 5, 1892, under which the deportations here
in question were sought. See Fong Yue Ting v. United
States, 149 U. S.698; Li Sing v. United States, 180 U. S.
486; Ah How v. United States, 193 U. S.65. A different
rule might apply if the statute had so connected the two
offenses that there could not be an unlawful remaining
unless there had been an unlawful entry. Compare § 1
of the Act of May 6, 1882, c. 126, 22 Stat. 58. As we agree
with the Government that the orders of deportation were
valid because these petitioners were then unlawfully
within the United States, we have no occasion to consider
its further contention that Congress intended § 19 to be
broadly retroactive.
Second. As to Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo a constitutional question also is presented. Each claims to be
shall be construed to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings brought,-or any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal, done or
existing at the time of the taking effect of this Act, except as mentioned in the third proviso of section nineteen hereof; but as to all
such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, acts, things, or matters,

the laws or parts of laws repealed or amended by this Act are hereby
continued in force and effect."

a foreign-born son of a native-born citizen; and, hence,
under § 1993 of the Revised Statutes, to be himself a citizen of the United States. They insist that, since they
claim to be citizens, Congress was without power to authorize their deportation by executive order. If at the
time of the arrest they had been in legal contemplation
without the borders of the United States, seeking entry,
the mere fact that they claimed to be citizens would not
have entitled them under the Constitution to a judicial
hearing. United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253; Tang
Tun v. Eatsell, 223 U. S. 673. But they were not in the
position of persons stopped at the border when seeking to
enter this country. Nor are they in the position of persons who entered surreptitiously. See United States v.
Wong You, 223 U. S. 67. They arrived at San Francisco,
a regularly designated port of entry; were duly taken to
the immigration station; and, after a protracted personal
examination, supplemented by the hearing of witnesses
and the examination of reports of immigration officials,
were ordered admitted as citizens. Then they applied for
and received their certificates of identity. Fifteen months
after the entry of one and six months after the entry of
the other, both were arrested, on the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, in Arizona where they were then living.
The constitutional question presented as to them is: May
a resident of the United States who claims to be a citizen
be arrested and deported on executive order? The proceeding is obviously not void ab initio. United States v.
Sing Tuck, 194 U. S. 161. But these petitioners did not
merely assert a claim of citizenship. They supported the
claim by evidence sufficient, if believed, to entitle them to
a finding of citizenship. The precise question is: Does
the claim of citizenship by a resident, so supported both
before the immigration officer and upon petition for a writ
of habeas corpus, entitle him to a judicial trial, of this
claim?

NG FUNG HO v. WHITE.
276.

Opinion of the Court.

The question suggests--but is different from-another
concerning deportation proceedings on which there is
much difference of opinion in the lower courts, namely:
Whether the provision which puts upon the detained the
burden of establishing his right to remain (see § 3 of the
Act of May 5, 1892; Chin Bak Kan v. United States, 186
U. S. 193; Ah How v. United States, 193 U. S. 65) applies
where one resident within the country is arrested under
the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Law, and claims
American citizenship.' There the proceeding for deportation is judicial in its nature. It is commenced usually
before a commissioner of the court; but on appeal to the
District Court additional evidence may be introduced and
the trial is de novo. Liu Hop Fong v. United States, 209
U. S. 453. The constitutional question presented in those
cases is merely how far the legislature may go in prescribing rules of evidence and burden of proof in judicial pro'In Moy Suey v. United States, 147 Fed. 697, where a Chinaman
who claimed to have been born in the United States was ordered
deported by the commissioner because he found that the prisoner
had not "satisfactorily established, by affirmative proof, his lawful
right to be and remain in the United States," the order of deportation
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,
because one within the country claiming to be a citizen "may not be
deported or banished until the right of the government to deport or
banish has been judicially determined." This decision was followed
in Gee Cue Beng v. United States, 184 Fed. 383 (C. C. A., Fifth
Circuit); Fong Gum Tong v. United States, 192 Fed. 320; United
States v. CharlieDart, 251 Fed. 394. Compare United States v. Jhu
Why, 175 Fed. 630. In the following cases it was held that the
burden of establishing American citizenship rested upon the Chinaman: Yee King v. United States, 179 Fed. 368; Kum Sue v. United
States, 179 Fed. 370; United States v. Too Toy, 185 Fed. 888; Yee
Ging v. United States, 190 Fed. 270; Bak Ki v. United States, 195

United States, 231 U. S. 9, 26; Hawes v. Georgia, 258
U. S. 1. Here the proceeding is throughout executive in
its nature.
Jurisdiction in the executive to order deportation exists
only if the person arrested is an alien. The claim of citizenship is thus a denial of an essential jurisdictional fact.
The situation bears some resemblance to that which arises
where one against whom proceedings are being taken under the military law denies that he is in the military
service. It is well settled that in such a case a writ of
habeas corpus will issue to determine the status. Ex
parte Reed, 100 U. S. 13; In re Grimley, 137 U. S. 147;
In re Morrissey, 137 U. S. 157; Johnson v. Sayre, 158
U. S. 109. Compare Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U. S. 556.
If the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor may not
be tested in the courts by means of the writ of habeas
corpus, when the prisoner claims citizenship and makes a
showing that his claim is not frivolous, then obviously
deportation of a resident may follow upon a purely executive order whatever his race or place of birth. For where
there is jurisdiction a finding of fact by the executive department is conclusive, United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S.
253; and courts have no power to interfere unless there
was either denial of a fair hearing, Chin Yow v. United
States, 208 U. S. 8, or the finding was not supported by
evidence, American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U. S. 94, or there was an application of an
erroneous rule of law, Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U. S. 3. To
deport- one who so claims to be a citizen, obviously deprives him of liberty, as was pointed out in Chin Yow v.
United States, 208 U. S. 8, 13. It may result also in loss
of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth
living. Against the danger of such deprivation without
the sanction afforded by judicial proceedings, the Fifth

Amendment affords protection in its guarantee of due
process of law. The difference in security of judicial over
administrative action has been adverted to by this court.
Compare United States v. Woo Jan, 245 U. S. 552, 556;
White v. Chin Fong, 253 U. S. 90, 93.
It follows that Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo are
entitled to a judicial determination of their claims that
they are citizens of the United States; but it does not
follow that they should be discharged. The practice indicated in Chin Yow v. United States, supra, and approved in Kwock Jan Fat v. White, 253 U. S. 454, 465,
should be pursued. Therefore, as to Gin Sang Get and
Gin Sang Mo, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded to the District
Court for trial in that court of the question of citizenship
and for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion. As to Ng Fung Ho and Ng Yuen Shew the
