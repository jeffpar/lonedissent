Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

LEMIEUX v. YOUNG, TRUSTEE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT O'

ERRORS OF THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT.

No. 48.

Argued December 9, 1908.-Decided January 4, 1909.

It is within the police power of the State to regulate sales of entire
stocks in trade of merchants so as to prevent fraud on innocent
creditors; and a state statute prohibiting such sales except under
reasonable conditions as to previous notice is not unconstitutional
under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; and so held as to §§ 4868 and 4869, General
Laws of Connecticut, as amended by chap. 72 of the Public Acts
of 1903.
79 Connecticut, 434, affirmed.
THE facts are stated in

the opinion.

Mr. Charles F. Thayer and Mr. John J. Phelan for plaintiff
inerror:

The provisions of the amended statute, requiring the spreading upon the town records of a notice of intention to sell, seven
days before the sale, were in violation of the Constitution of the
United States, as abridging and depriving the plaintiff in error
of his' liberty, or property or his contract rights, as provided
by the Fourteenth Amendment. Case below, 79 Connecticut

The statute cannot be justified as an exercise of the police
power. No legislative enactment can impute a crime, under

The amended statute violates § 1, of Art. XIV, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, because it denies to the plaintiff in error as the vendee of said Hendrick, and
to persons placed in a position similar to that of the plaintiff
in error, the equal protection of the laws of Connecticut, and
abridges their respective privileges and immunities as citizens
of the United States. Barbier -v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27, 31;

in its opinion. Statutes upon the same subject, but with much
more rigorous and burdensome conditions, have been held to
be constitutional. Squire & Co. v. Tellier, 185 Massachusetts,
18.
The fact that property may be'destroyed through the enforcement of a statute, and the right of contract either prohibited or restricted, is not decisive on the question of constitutionality. Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. 165; Soon

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.

Whether the following provisions of the general laws of Connecticut are repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment because
wanting in due process of law and denying the equal protection
of the laws, is the question for decision:
"SEc. 4868, as amended by chapter 72 of the public acts of
Connecticut of 1903. No person who makes it his business to
buy commodities and sell the samein small quantities for the
purpose of making a profit, shall at a single transaction, and
not in the regular course of business sell, assign, or deliver the
whole, or a large part of his stock in trade, unless he shall,
not less than seven days previous to such sale, assignment, or
delivery, cause to be recorded in the town clerk's office in the
town in which such vendor conducts his said business, a notice
of his intention to make such sale, assignment, or delivery,
which notice shall be in writing describing in general terms the
property to be so sold, assigned, or delivered, and all conditions of such sale, assignment, or delivery, and the parties
thereto.
"SE c. 4869. All such sales, assignments, or deliveries of
commodities which shall be made without the formalities required by the provisions of sec. 4868 shall be void as against

Opinion of the Court.

all persons who were creditors of the vendor at the time of
such transaction."
The controversy thus arose. Philip E. Hendricks conducted
a retail drug store at Taftville, Connecticut. While engaged
in such business, in August, 1904, he sold his stock in bulk to
Joseph A. Lemieux, his clerk, for a small cash payment and
his personal negotiable notes. The sale was made without
compliance with the requirements of the statute above quoted.
Subsequently Hendricks was adjudicated a bankrupt, and the
trustee of his estate commenced this action against Lemieux
and replevied the stock of goods. Among other grounds the
trustee based his right to recover upon the non-compliance with
the statutory requirements in qucstion. In the trial one of the
grounds upon which Lemieux relied was the assertion that
the statute was void for repugnancy to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the Jnited States, because wanting
in due process of law and denying the equal protection of the
laws. The trial court adjudged in favor of the trustee and his
action in so doing was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Errors
of Connecticut, to which the case was taken on appeal. 79
Connecticut, 434. The cause was then brought to this court.
The Supreme Court of Errors, in upholding the validity of
the statute, decided that the subject with which it dealt was
within the police power of the State, as the statute alone sought
to regulate the manner of disposing of a stock in trade outside
of the regular course of business, by methods which, if uncontrolled, were often resorted to for the consummation of fraud
to the injury of innocent creditors. In considering whether
the requirements of the statute were so onerous and restrictive
as td be repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, the court
said:
"It does not seem to'us, either from a consideration of the
requirements themselves of the act, or of the facts of the case
before us, that the restrictions placed by the legislature upon
sales of the/ kind in question are such as will cause such serious
inconvenience to those affected by them as will amount to an

Opinion of the Court.

unconstitutional deprivation of property. A retail dealer, who
owes no debts may lawfully sell his entire stock without giving
the required notice. One who is indebted may make a valid
sale without such notice, by paying his debts, even after the
sale is made. Insolvent and fraudulent vendors are those who
will be chiefly affected by the act, and it is for the protection
of creditors against sales by them of their entire stock at a
single transaction and not in the- regular course of business,
that its provisions are aimed. It is, of course, possible that
an honest and solvent retail dealer might, in consequence of
the required notice before the sale,, lose an opportunity of selling
his business, or suffer some loss from the delay of a sale occasioned by the giving of such notice. But 'a possible application to extreme cases' is not the test of reasonableness of
public rules and regulations. Commonwealth v. Plaisted, 148
Massachusetts, 375. 'The essential quality of the police power
as a governmental agency is that it imposes upon persons and
property burdens designed to promote the safety and welfare
of the general public. Chicago &c. R. Co. v. State, 47 Nebraska,
549, 564."
That the court below was right in holding that the subject
with which the statute dealt was within the lawful scope of
the police authority of the State, we think is too clear to require discussion. As pointed out by Vann, J., in a dissenting
opinion delivered by him in Wright v. Hart, 182 N. Y. 350, the
subject has been, with great unanimity, considered not only
to be within the police power, but as requiring an exertion of
such power. He said:
"Twenty States, as well as the Federal Government in the
District of Columbia, have similar statutes, some with provisions more stringent than our own, and all aimed at the
suppression of an evil that is thus shown to be almost universal.

A statute with the same object attained by a similar remedy
has been held valid' by the highest courts in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Tennessee 'and Washington. J. P. Squires &
Co. v. Tellier, 185 Massachusetts, 18; Walp v. Mooar, 76 Connecticut, 515; Neas v. Borches,.109 Tennessee, 398; McDaniels
v. J. J. Connelly Shoe Co., 30 Washington, 549. An act declaring such sales presumptively fraudulent was assumed to
be valid by the courts of last resort in Wisconsin and Maryland.
Fisher v. Herrman, 118 Wisconsin, 424; Hart v. Roney, 93
Maryland, 432. On the other hand, a statute with more exacting conditions was held unconstitutional in Ohio (Miller v.
Crawford, 70 Ohio, 207), and a similar act met the same fate,
in Utah, where a violation of the statute was made a crime
(Block V. Schwartz, 27 Utah, 387)?'
To the cases thus cited may be added Williams v. Fourth
National Bank, 15 Oklahoma, 477,- Where a statute was sustained, which made sales in bulk. presumptively fraudulent
when the requirements of the statute were not observed.
The argument here, however, does not deny all power to
pass a statute regulating the subject in question, but principally insists that, the conditions exacted by this particular statute. are so arbitrary and onerous -as to cause the law to be
repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. To support this
view in many forms of statement it is reiterated that the con-

ditions imposed by the statute so fetter the power to contract
for the purchase and sale of property of the character described
in the statute as to deprive of property without due process of
law, and, moreover, because the conditions apply only to retail
dealers, it is urged that the necessary effect of the statute is,
as to such dealers, to give rise to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. We think it is unnecessary to follow in detail
the elaborate argument by which it is sought to sustain these
propositions. Their want of merit is demonstrated by the
reasoning by which the court below sustained the statute as
partially shown by the excerpt which we have previously
quoted from the opinion announced below. Indeed, the court
below in its opinion pointed out that the statute did not cause
sales which were made without compliance with its requirements to be absolutely void, but made them simply voidable
at the instance of those who were creditors at the time the
sales were made. Moreover, the unsoundness of the contentions is additionally shown by the number of cases in state
courts of last resort sustaining statutes of a similar nature,
which we need not here cite, as they are referred to in the
excerpt heretofore made- from the opinion of Vann, J., in
IVright v. Hart, supra.
Much support in argument was sought to be deduced from
the opinion in Tl'right v. Hart; Miller v. Cra'uford (70 Ohio St.
207), and Block v. Schwartz (27 Utah, 387). It is true that in
those cases statutes deahing with the subject with which the
one before us is concerned were decided to be unconstitutional.
But we think it is unnecessary to analyze the cases or to intimate any opinion as to the persuasive n ess of the reaoning

by which the conclusion expressed in them was sustained.'
This is said because it is apparent from the most casual in'spection of the opinions in the cases in question that the statutes there considered contained conditions of a much more
onerous anid restrictive character than those which are fould
in the statute before us.
As the subject to which the statute relates was clearly

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Syllabus.

211 U. S.

within the police powers of the State, the statute cannot be
held to be repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the nature or character of the
regulations which the statute embodies, unless it clearly appears that those regulations are so beyond all reasonable relation to the subject to which they are applied as to amount
to mere arbitrary usurpation of power. Booth v. Illinois, 184
U. S. 425. This, we think, is clearly not the case. So, also,
as the statute makes a classification based upon a reasonable
distinction' and one which, as we have seen, hasbeen generally
applied in the exertion of the police power over the subject,
there is no 'foundation for the proposition that the result of
the enforcement of the statute will be to deny the equal protection of the laws.

COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

No. 32.

Argued December 1, 1908.-Decided January 4, 1909.

Where the Atate court decides that a trustee in bankruptcy can avoid
a preference under the state law against the contention that the exertion of such power conflicts with the bankrupt law, and that if
the preference is given by a member of a firm that the trustee need
not establish that there were other individual creditors, Federal questions are involved and necessarily decided, and the judgment does not
rest on non-Federal grounds broad enough to sustain it and may be
reviewed by this court under § 709, Rev. Stat.
Where no question is made below that the state court was not competent to authorize the trustee to prosecute, judgment in his favor will
not be, reversed when presumably the want of authority from the
bankrupt court would have been supplied if challenged.
The authority to preserve liens of pending actions under subd. I of § 67
of the bankrupt law extends to causes of action under state law and
is cumulative, and not in abrogation of rights under the state law.
Where, as in Louisiana, copartnership creditors coequally share with
individual creditors in the individual estates of the members of the
firm, copartnership creditors are prejudiced by preferences made by
