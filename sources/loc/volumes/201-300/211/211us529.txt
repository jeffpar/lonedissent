was exercised according to law. And how redemption should
be exercised and how it could be cut off depended upon the
provisions of the statute and, therefore, the best answer to the
assumption of plaintiff in error, that he acquired an indefeasible title, is the answer given by the Supreme Court of
the State, whose province it is to pronounce the meaning of
the statutes of the State without question by this court. The
court said: "The deeds which the defendant received from the
State are expressly made subject to the relevant conditions

imposed by Act No. 229, Public Acts of 1897, as amended.
Whatever the title whiciA the State held, it sold to defendant
[plaintiff in error] an interest in the lands which was liable to
be divested." And the court sustained the bill and ordered a
decree to be entered in accordance with its prayer.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

211 U. S.

Not decided, the court not having jurisdiction of the appeal, whether
an enlisted man can, under the circumstances of this case, be discharged without honor by order of the President without trial by
court-martial.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Chase Mellen, with whom Mr. Francis Woodbridge was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The powers to raise, support and govern the army are vested
in Congress. Constitution, Art. I, §§ 8, 10; Art. II, §§ 1, 2, 3;
Fifth Amendment; .U. S. Comp. Stat., 1901, pp. 814, 817; Articles of War (U. S. Rev. Stat., § 1342).
The discharge of the petitioner was intended to be, and was,
in fact, a punishment.
A discharge without honor is of doubtful legality. 2 Winthrop on Military Law (2d ed.), 847, 848; Davis on Military.
Law, 357; O'Brien's American Military Law.
Assuming that the riotous disturbance was participated in by
some member of the battalion, the punishment of the innocent
was not thereby justified.
The President has no powers except such as are conferred
upon him by the Constitution and the laws of Congress enacted
thereunder. Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U: S. 46, 90; McCulloch

the Military Secretary have no application whatsoever to the
present case. Thompson v. Kentucky, 209 U. S. 340, 346;

The President's belief that the good of the service and the
maintenance of the morale of the army required that there
should be in the army only such troops as he could absolutely
rely upon and safely quarter under arms among the people is
not a justification in law for the discharge without trial of 167
enlisted men accused of serious crimc. Ex parte Milligan, 4
Wall. 2.
The President's act in ordering the discharge of the petitioner without trial is tantamount to nullification of the provision of the Constitution which gives Congress the power to
raise and support armies. Arbitrary action by any branch of
the Government is not favored in American jurisprudence.,

The Solicitor General for defendant in error:
The court is without jurisdiction and the case should be dismissed. This court examines into its own jurisdiction or the
jurisdiction of the lower court of its own motion whetlier the
question is raised and discussed by counsel or not. Great

Mottley, 211 U. S. 149.
As to the jurisdiction of this court: The amount involved is
$122.26. Under the Court of Claims statutes $3,000 must be
involved to enable a claimant to bring a case into this court
on appeal from the Court of Claims. § 707, Rev. Stat. The
Tucker Act, which re-defines and enlarges the claims jurisdiction, and extends it to the District and Circuit Courts, makes
no difference in respect to jurisdiction and the right of appeal
between cases in the Court of Claims proper and such cases
in the District and Circuit Courts. The statutes governing
appeals in such cases in the District and Circuit Courts are the

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

Court of Claims statutes and not the statutes generally governing appeals and writs of error in the District and Circuit
Courts. United States v. Jones, 131 U. S. 1; United States v.
Davis, 131 U. S. 36.
This case squarely presents the question whether § 14 of the
Circuit Court of Appeals Act so far repealed the Tucker Act
and the other Court of Claims statutes as to permit a claims
case involving less than the jurisdictional amount to be brought
to this court on appeal from a District Court when a constitutional question is involved, although such case could not be
brought to this court on appeal from the Court of Claims.
The Government contends that it was not the intention of
Congress by this general repeal provision to disturb the peculiar and special jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts
sitting as courts of claims.'
A similar question was presented in the case of Dalcour v.
United States, 203 U. S. 408, where it was held that although
the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was intended to supersede
previous general provisions, it-did not repeal a special act giving jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of appeals direct from a
District Court on a claim of title to public lands. The phrase
"unless otherwise provided by law" in § 6 of that act was held
in United States v. Dalcour, 203 U. S. 408, as relating to existing
and not future provisions of law, and as saving some although
not all existing provisions. Those words were inserted in the
statute to guard against implied repeals and that they are to
be construed as referring only to laws in force at the time of
the, passage of the act. Law Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S.
47; and see also Louisville Public Warehouse Co. v. Collector,
49 Fed. Rep. 561; United States v. Sutton, 47 Fed. Rep. 129.
As to the jurisdiction of the lower court: The Tucker Act
(amendment of June 27, 1898, 30 Stat. 494) provides that the
jurisdiction thereby conferred upon the Circuit and District
Courts shall not extend to claims for compensation for official
services of officers of the United States. A private soldier,
although standing in emphatic contrast to an officer of the army,

REID v. UNITED STATES.
211 U. S.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

is fairly within the meaning of the term "officer of the United States" as used in the act. The legal definitions of officer
include within their scope a private soldier. 2 BL. Com. 36;
Henly v. Mayor of Lyme, 5 Bing. 91; United States v. Hartwell,
6 Wall. 385; Mechem's Pub. Offices and Officers, § 1; United
States v. Morris, 2 Brock. 96; United States v. McCrory, 91
Fed. Rep.. 295; Ex parte Smith, 2 Cr. C. C. 693; United States v.
Tinklepaugh, 3 Blatchf. 425; and this construction is in accordance with the legislative intent as shown by the proceedings
in Congress, and the necessity of concentrating all suits for
statutory compensation for official services in the Court of
Claims proper. Report House Judiciary Committee, No. 325,
55th Cong., 2d Sess.
As to the merits: No real constitutional question is involved.
The contention that plaintiff's discharge before the expiration
of his term of enlistment amounted to depriving him of property without due process of law is untenable. The power to
appoint includes the power to remove. Public office or employment creates no vested right, and a soldier's enlistment is not
different from any other public service. Parsons v. United
States, 167 U. S. 324; Blake v. United States, 103 U. S. 227;
Street v. United States, 133 U. S. 299; Crenshaw v. United States,

States v. Blakeney, 3 Gratt. 405; In re Morrissey, 137 U. S. 157.
The President has inherent constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief summarily to discharge a soldier; the right
has been expressly recognized by the Articles of War, and has
the sanction of uninterrupted administrative practice; and the
power involves an exercise of discretion not reviewable by the
courts. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2; Legal Tender Case, 110

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

By leave of court the Judge Advocate General of the Army
filed a brief as amicus curice.
MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit for $122.26, alleged to be due to the plaintiff in
error as an enlisted man in the regular army from November 16,
1906, to July 18, 1907, when his term of service expired. The
plaintiff in error was one of the members of Companies B, C
and D, of the First Battalion of the Twenty-fifth United States
Infantry, who were discharged without honor by order of the
President on the former date, without trial, after certain disturbances in Brownsville, Texas, in which the order averred
members of those companies to have participated. The petition alleges that the plaintiff in error had no part in the disturbance and no knowledge as to who was concerned in it,
and denies the power of the President to make such a discharge.
The answer, after certain preliminaries, suggests for a second
defense that the District Court has no jurisdiction, by reason
of the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, § 2, 24 Stat. 505, as amended
by the act of June 27, 1898, c. 503, §2, 30 Stat. 494, which
provides that the jurisdiction conferred "shall not extend to
cases brought to recover fees, salary, or compensation for
official services of officers of the United States," etc. For a
third defense the answer alleges the investigations that wvre
made, the reported impossibility of identifying the culprits
unless the soldiers would take it in hand or turn State's evidence, the President's belief that the crimes under consideration were committed by a considerable group of the members
of the regiment and that the greater part of the regiment must
know who were the guilty men, and the issuing of the order in
consequence, not as a punishment but for the good of the service, and affirms that it was in accordance with precedent.
The third defense was demurred to, the demurrer was sustained, the petition was dismissed on the merits and this writ
of error was brought.

REID v. UNITED STATES.
211 U. S.'

Opinion of the Court.

As the case comes here on the merits and not on a certificate
under the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, § 5, 26 Stat. 826, the
first question that we have to consider is the jurisdiction of this
court, and on this point, without going further, we must yield
to the argument submitted, although not urged, on behalf .of
the United States. The jurisdiction of the District Court is
derived from the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, § 3, 24 Stat. 505,
by which it is made concurrent with that of the Court of Claims
when the amount of the claim does not exceed one thousand
dollars, and that of the Circuit Court is made concurrent for
amounts between one thousand and ten thousand dollars.
By §4, the right of appeal "shall be governed by the law now
in force," and by § 9, the plaintiff, or the United States, in any
suit brought under the provisions of the act "shall have the
same rights of appeal or writ of error as are now reserved in the
statutes of the United States in that behalf made." This
meant the same right of appeal as was given from the Court of
Claims, United States-v. Davis, 131 U. S. 36; so that it hardly
admits of doubt that when that statute went into effect an
appeal or writ of error under it by a claimant demanding less
than three thousand dollars would have been dismissed. Rev.
Stat., § 707. See Strong v. United States, 40 Fed. Rep. 183.
The real question is whether this limitation is done away
with or qualified by the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, §§ 5, 6,
and 14, 26 Stat. 826. By § 14 "all acts and parts of acts relating to appeals or writs of error inconsistent with the provisions for review by appeals or writs of error in the preceding
sections five and six of this act are hereby repealed." By § 5,
writs of error may be taken. from the District Courts directfto,
this court when the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, the questidn of jurisdiction alone being certified; in which case no other
question is open. United States v. Larkin, 208 U. S. 333, 340.
That clause does not apply here. The only other clauses of
§ 5 that are or could be relied upon are "In any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of
the United States." "In any case in which the constitutionality

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

of any law of the United States

.

.

211 U. S.

is drawn in question."

The latter may be dismissed as having no bearing, although
it was mentioned, so that the possible application of § 5, and
the consequent inference that the former limitations on the
right to come to this court are repealed, so far as this case is
concerned, depend on the suggestion in the petition that by
his discharge the plaintiff was deprived of his property without
due process of law.
We shall not discuss that suggestion, because we are of opinion that in any event the repealing words that we have quoted
do not apply to the special jurisdiction of the District Court
sitting as a Court of Claims. Suits against the United States
can be maintained, of course, only by permission of .the United States, and in the .manner and subject to the restrictions
that it may see fit to impose. Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205
U. S. 349, 353. It has given a restricted permission, and has
created a pattern jurisdiction in the Court of Claims, with a
limited appeal. 'The right to take up cases from that court by
writ of error still is limited as heretofore. It would not be expected that a different rule would be laid down for other courts
that for convenience are allowed to take its place, when originally the rule was the same. It does not seem to us that
Congress has done so unlikely a thing. The act of March 3,
.1891, c. 517, is dealing with general, not special jurisdiction.
It has been decided in some cases of special jurisdiction that
there is an implied exception to almost equally broad words
in the same act. United States v. Dalcour, 203 U. S. 408. Congress, when its mind was directed to the specific question, determined for all courts what the amount must be before the
grace of the sovereign power would grant more than one hearing. It has not changed that amount for the usual case. A
change looking to the ordinary business of the courts should
not be held, to embrace that, merely on the strength of words
general enough to include it, when the policy of the repealing
law, and the policy of the law alleged to be repealed, have such
different directions, and when it appears that the general policy

McLEAN v. ARKANSAS.

of the latter still is maintained. The limitation with reference
to amount unquestionably remains in force for the District
Court in cases outside of the act of 1891, § 5, as well as for the
Court of Claims. In our opinion, the act of 1891, § 5, was not
intended to create exceptions, when no such exceptions exist
for the Court of Claims.
We observe that the plaintiff in error gives a hint at dissatisfaction" with the Government for raising this point. But
jurisdiction is not a matter 'of sympathy or favor. The courts
are bound to take notice of the limits of their authority, and it is
no part of the defendant's duty to help in obtaining an unauthorized judgment by s'urprise.
Writ of error dismissed.

ERROR TO THE ,SUPREME .COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.

,-No. 29.

Submitted November 30, 1908.-Decided January 4, 1909.

Liberty of contract which iWprotected against hostile state legislation is
not universal, but is subject to legislative restrictions in the exercise
of the police power of the State.
The police power of the State is not unlimited and is subject to judicial
review, and laws arbitrarily and oppressively exercising it may be
annulled as violative of constitutional rights.
The legislature of a State is primarily the judge of the necessity of exercisiig the .police power and courts will only interfere in case the act
exceeds legislative authority; the fact that the court doubts its-wisdom or propriety affords no ground for declaring a state law uncon• stitutional or invalid.
In the. light of conditions surrounding their enactment this court will
•not hold that the legislative acts requiring coal to be measured for
payment of miners' wages before screening are not reasonable police
regulations and within the police power of the State; and so held
that the Arkansas act so providing 'is not unconstitutional under the
