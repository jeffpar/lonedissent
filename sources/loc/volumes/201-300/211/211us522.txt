of the United States in any manner or for any purpose within
the intendment of that section.
It remains only to notice the ruling of the court below as
to the bar of the statute of limitations. While the act of 1907 1
gives authority to come directly here to obtain a review of"
the construction of a statute under the circumstances which
the act enumerates, and blso authorizes us to review a "decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the
defendant has not been put in jeopardy," we consider that
the power given, is coincident with the purpose for which it
was conferred, that is, to have determined in a case within
the statute the question whether or not the Government is
entitled to further prosecute the case, and therefore does not
of cotirse call upon us to decide every question of the character
referred to-in the statute, when by the decision of one of such
question's the case is completely disposed of and the other
questions 'bave become so irrelevant as to cause it to be in
our opinion unnecessary to consider and determine them. Of
course, under these circumstances, we intimate no opinion whatever concerning the correctness of the -construction adopted
by the court below./in respect to the'statute of limitations.

Argument for Defendants in Error.

The: Attorney General and The Solicitor ,Gefteral, with whom
Mr. Edwin W. Lawrence, Special Assistafit to the Attorney
General, for the United States.1
Mr. Edmund F. Richardson, with whom Mr. Horace N.
Hawkins was on the brief, for defendants in error:
The indictment contains no charge of a crime, in that it
charges the plan or alleged conspiracy of defendants to have
been simply an 4greement or plan to obtain indirectly lands
for a .corporation, that could not, according to the indictment,
have been directly purchased by the said corporation. .A plan
to obtain indirectly lands -from the Government %mayor may
not be a plan to defraud the Government. Whether or not it is
a scheme-to defraud the Government necessarily
depends upon
the question of whether or not the means to be adopted are
criminal or unlawful.
No unlawful or criminal means are charged to have been
planned or contemplated, there being no claim made in the indictment that the defendants agreed, or planned to hire, employ or induce anyone to make application to purchase lands.
In other words, no claim is made anywhere in the indictment
that the alleged conspiracy embraced the making of a deal. or
agreement with any person in advance of that person having
made, in good faith, An application to purchase the land. There
is, therefore, no charge of a conspiracy to defraud the United States.
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution secures to the
defendants, among other things, the right "to be informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation." United States vMiller, 7 Pet. 1422; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542,

MR.

JUSTICE

WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.

In this case the United States seeks the reversal of the action of the court below in quashing an indictment, the writ of
error being prosecuted directly from this court upon the assumption that the case comes within the act of March 2, 1907.
The indictment charged a conspir4cy in violation of ยง 5440,
Rev. Stat., to unlawfully acquire land of the United States
under the timber and stone act. The court gave to the indictment the same construction which it affixed to the indictment
in the, case of United States v. Biggs et al., No. 289. which we
have just decided, ante, p. 507, and applied the same principles
which it expounded in the opinion in that case. Disregarding mere immaterial differences in the form of the pleadings

No. 288.

Argued December 16, 17, 1908.-Decided January 4, 1909.

Decided on the auihority of United States v. Biggs, ante, p. 507.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
The Attorney General and The Solicitor General, with whom
Mr. Edwin W. Lawrence, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, was on the brief for the United States.1
Mr. Charles J. Hughes and Mr. Clyde C. Dawson for defendants in error.1
MR.

JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

In this case the court below quashed an indictment, and a
writ of error direct from this court is prosecuted on behalf of
the United States, upon the theory by which it prosecuted the
writ in the case of United States v. Biggs et al., No. 289, just
dec'ided. The case presented by the record, omitting references to irrelevant distinctions in the form of the pleadings, is
like that in the Biggs case, and is controlled and disposed of by
the opinion just announced therein.
Affirmed.
