WILDER,' ASSESSOR.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

HAWAII.
No. 23.

Argued October 28, 29, 1908.-Decided November 16, 1908.

In determining rights and liabilities, local legislation under authority of
Congress previously granted is treated as emanating from the local
legislature and not from Congress.
A general ratification by Congress of charters does not amount to mak-

ing the charters so ratified acts'of Congress.
A ratification of legislation between certain specified dates does not ex-

clude legislation enacted on those dates. Taylor v. Brown, 147 U. S.
640.
A provision in a charter that certain payments shall be made out of income and that, after dividends up to a specified percentage have been

paid, the balance shall be divided between the government and the
stockholders, does not, in the absence of any exemption in express
terms, exempt the corporation from taxation on its franchise.
18 Hawaii, 668, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. David L. Withington and Mr. Aldis B. Browne, with
whom Mr. Alexander Britton and Mr. William R. Castle were
on the brief, for appellant:
The franchise, ratified by Congress and approved by the
President, is an irrevocable contract, providing in definite terms
for the division of the revenue of the company between the
Territory and the company, and fixing the charges deductible
from the income, which charges include taxes on the physical
property, but not on the franchise.
The term railway as used in the act is defined to be the
physical structure and not an intangible right, and hence the

Argument for Appellant.

211 U. S.

"completed and equipped portions liable to taxation" are
portions of the physical structure; so that the taxation to
which the 'corporation becomes liable is a tax on the physical
structure of the road, thus creating a charge on the income.
Taxing the completed and equipped portions as fast as they
are completed and equipped is consistent with the taxation of
the real and personal property "separately as to each item for
its full cash value;" it is inconsistent with the contention that
the aggregate value in operation as an enterprise for profit,
which would include the franchise, can be so assessed. Nor can
the franchise itself be assessed separately; it is not a part of the
completed and equipped portion of the road, and although the
word "franchise" is to be found ifi
§ 1215, which describes the
character of personal property to be taxed, it had long been
held to be the policy of Hawaii to tax only tangible property.
McBryde v. Kala, 6 Hawaii, 529; Brewer v. Luce, 6 Hawaii,
554.
Moreover, it would be double taxation and unconstitutional.
Kekaha Sugar Co. v. Hawaiian Government, 8 Hawaii, 293.
The franchise was one in which the right to share with the
.Territory was the only beneficial right which the corporation
enjoyed.
Where the property itself was taxed which comprised the
enterprise, to tax the pight to share is double taxation. Kekaha
Sugar Co. v. Hawaiian Government, ubi supra; Alexander v.
Fornander, 6 Hawaiij 322; Haiku Sugar Co. v. Fornander, 6
Hawaii, 532; Castle v. Luce, 4 Hawaii, 63.
While an exemption from taxation must be plainly and
unmistakably granted, since in grants from the public nothing
passes by implication, the exemption need not be in any
particular words, is not implied but is expressed if, from all
the language of the grant, there is no doubt of the contract.

The power of amendment of charters may be exercised where
it will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant
or any rights which have vested under it. But the alterations
must be reasonable, must be made in good faith and be consistent with the scope and object of the act of incorporation.

The franchise of the company, granted by the Republic of
Hawaii, July 7, 1898, ratified by Congress and approved by the
President, is not assessable.
Whether or not, without Congressional action, the franchise
granted by the Republic of Hawaii on the very day of the passage of the resolution of annexation would have been perfect
if accepted by the grantees; until accepted, Congress had the
power to take away that right, and the approval by Congress
and its ratification in the organic art is a part of the contract
between the parties. California v. Central Pacific R. R. Co.,
127 U. S. 1.
The State has power to levy property tax on a corporation
holding a Federal franchise, but has no power to subject its

Mr. Charles R.Hemenway, Attorney General of the Territory

for appellee:
The franchise of appellant is not a Federal franchise, and
even if it were it would be subject to local taxation. The approval by Congress of the act of the legislature of the Republic
of Hawaii, amounts to no more than a prior authorization. It
was a ratification only of an act of the Republic of Hawaii and
was not intended to, nor did it, confer a special grant from Congress itself. Miners' Bank v. State of Iowa, 12 How. 1; Lyons v.
Wood, 153 U. S. 661; United States v. Church, 5 Utah, 373

The terms of the franchise itself grant no immunity from
taxation, nor is it 'exempt under the general laws of Hawaii.
Revised Laws of Hawaii, §§ 851, 1212, 1215, 1216.
Within the meaning of the sections above quoted the franchise of appellant was properly considered a part of its property
and taxable in connection with the other property of appellant
as combined property forming the baw.6 of an enterprise for
profit, since the franchise, of necessity, was subject to all general
laws in force at the time it was granted, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. Theological Seminary v. Illinois, 188

Under the provisions of the act to provide a government for
the Territory of Hawaii, 31 Stat. 141, as is also the case under
the organic acts of the other Territories, the power of taxation is general and restricted only by the Constitution and laws
of the United States. Peacock v. Pratt 121 Fed. Rep.. 772, 776;

The tax assessed and in controversy here is not upon the
franchise of appellant, as such, but upon the combined property
of appellant as an enterprise for profit.
MR.

JtfsTIcE

HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal. from a judgment affirming a decision of the
Tax Appeal Court and sustaining a tax upon the appellant.
The appellant objected to the tax on the grounds that its
franchise was derived from an act of Congress and therefore
was exempt from taxation, and that its charter also exempted
it in terms. These objections, taken below, were argued at
length before us.
The charter was granted by the Republic of Hawaii on
July 7, 1898, the day on which Congress passed the resolution
of annexation, and doubts having been felt as to the right of
the Hawaiian legislature to grant a charter at that time (see
22 Op. Att. Gen. 574; Ibid., 627), the organic act declared that
"Subject to the approval of the President

chises granted by the Hawaiian government in conformity

eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and the twenty-eighth
day of September, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, are
hereby ratified and confirmed." Act of April 30, 1900, c. 339,
§ 73, 31 Stat. 141, 154. It is contended that the effect of
this section was to make the charter an act of Congress by
adoption. In our opinion this is a mistake. There is no doubt
that local legislation under the authority of Congress previously
granted is treated as emanating from its immediate, not from
its remote source, in determining rights and liabilities. Kawdnanakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353, 354. See Matter
of Moran, 203 U. S. 96, 104. A general ratification like tlat
of existing laws. in § 6 would have no greater effect. We discover nothing in the words just quoted from § 73 to indicate
that Congress had this particular franchise in view, or meant
to .adopt it and give it a superior source, or to do anything
more than to supply the power that by accident might have
been wanting. See Miners' Bank v. Iowa, 12 How. 1, 8;
Murphy v. Utter, 186 U. S. 95, 106. We need not pursue further
this part of the objection to the tax, except to remark that,
in view of the obvious purpose, it properly was admitted that
July 7 was not excluded from the ratification by the word
"between." See Taylor v. Brown, '147 U. S. 640. For it also
was admitted at the argument before us that if there was no
exemption in the charter the appellant had no case, and we
are of opinion that there was none.
The tax in question is a property tax, and the effect of the
decision is to uphold a valuation of the whole property as a
going concern, and as more than a mere congeries of items;
or in other words, an addition of half a million dollars to the
appellant's valuation, for the franchise of the company. The
appellant says'that this was contrary to § 17 of its charter,
construed in the light of the scheme disclosed. That section
provides that "the following charges shall be lawful upon the
income of said railway: 1st. The exlbense of operating, repairs,
'renewals, extensions,. interest, and every other cost and charge
properly or necessarily connected with the maintenance and

Opinion of the Court.

operation of said railway. 2nd. Dividends may be paid to
the stockholders not to exceed eight per cent. on the par value
of the stock issued. 3d. A sinking fund may be created for
the redemption of any bond which may be issued or other
record debt and the capital upon the expiration of the franchise. Provided [that the amount is limited as set forth].
4th. The excess of income shall be divided equally between
the Government of the Republic of Hawaii and the stockholders of said corporation." It is said that here is a complete
plan for the division of the income, declAring what charges shall
be lawful, and that only such taxes are allowed as fall under
the words, "other charge properly connected with the maintenance and operation of the road."
The taxes authorized as such charges are thought to be
limited to a license tax not to exceed ten dollars on each passenger car used, imposed by § 31, and to the provisions of
§ 30. The latter section exempts from duty material produced
in and imported from the United States, and goes on to say
that "the property of said association and others shall not be
liable to internal taxation while said railway is under construction, provided that as fast as completed and equipped the
completed and equipped portion shall.'become liable to such
taxation." It is said that when the ¢hiWrter was granted real
and personal property were assessed for taxation "separately
as to each item thereof for its full cah'value,', .with provisos
deemed not to be material, Rev. L. Hawaii, 1905, § 1216, that
§ 30 contemplates a taxation of this kind, and that a taxation
of the franchise would be double taxation and was excluded.
It is true that one of the provisos in § 1216 taxes going concerns as wholes, but § 30 is thought to show a choice of the
other method. It is contended that the charter by fair implication contracts against any other charges, especially in view
of the ultimate division of the excess of income, after the payment of eight per cent dividend. If the dividends do not exceed
eight per cent the tax will fall wholly on the stockholders, contrary to the fair understanding of what the charter holds out.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Syllabus.

211 U. S.

The argument of which we have given a summary outline is
far from establishing such a clear renunciation of the right to
tax as the cases require. Metropolitan Street Ry. Co. v. New
York State Board of Tax Commissioners, 199 U. S. 1. It appears
to us very questionable whether the phrase, "charges properly
or necessarily connected with the maintenance and operation
of the road," has any reference to taxes. It points inanother
direction. Taxes are left unmentioned in § 17, and the liability to them is assumed. The language of §30 does not import
the imposition of a tax that otherwise would be excluded.
It takes the liability for granted, and relieves the company
from the burden for a certain time. The drift of the section
cannot be made clearer by leIgthy restatement. It starts with
exoneration and merely saves the right to tax the portions
completed by a proviso which, in this case, fulfills the proper
function of that much abused term. If any doubt were raised
by § 17, which does not seem to us to be the case, it would be
relieved by this further section of the same act. Nothing
else seems to us to need mention in the present posture of the
case.
Judgment affirmed.
