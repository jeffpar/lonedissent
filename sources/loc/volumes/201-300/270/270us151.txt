attempting a sale in the United States as to indicate a
disposition to speculate at the expense of the Government. In view of the complete good faith manifested
by Swift & Company in this whole transaction, and the
willingness on its part to give up its claim for larger damages for failure of the Government to take the full March
delivery, and in the absence of proof that the bellies might
have been disposed of anywhere else at a better price, we
think the same result should be reached in case of the
bellies as in that of the bacon. We think the Government should pay the difference between the fair contract
price, as found by the Court of Claims, and the actual
sales of the material remaining. In that view there
should be added to the recovery on the cross appeal
$212,216.69, the excess of the contract price over the net
amount realized. The judgment of the Court of Claims is
accordingly affirmed for the amount already allowed by
it, with directions to allow the additional amount now
awarded on the cross appeal.
Affirmed with modification.

Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Claims denying a salary claim.

Solicitor General Mitchell and Assistant Attorney General Galloway for the United States, in support of the
motion.
Mr. John H. Morse, pro se, in opposition thereto.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
John H. Morse, claiming that he had been illegally
separated from the Civil Service of the United States,
filed his petition in the Court of Claims for $4,000 for his
salary. Upon a general traverse the case was heard and
the Court made findings of fact and entered judgment
that the petition of the plaintiff should be dismissed on
the merits. The judgment was entered on the 21st of
January, 1924. On March 19, 1924, Morse filed a motion
for a new trial. This motion was overruled by the Court
on May 4, 1924. On May 28, 1924, Morse presented a
motion for leave to file a motion to amend the findings
of fact. This motion for leave to file was overruled by
the Court of Claims on June 2, 1924. On June 9, 1924,
Morse presented a motion for leave to file a motion to
reconsider and grant a new trial, and on the same day the
Court of Claims overruled the motion for leave to file.
On September 5, 1924, Morse made application for an
appeal to this Court. The Court of Claims allowed the
appeal on October 13, 1924. At the time of allowing the
appeal, the Court of Claims filed a memorandum, calling
attention to the dates upon which the steps referred to
above had occurred and to the rule of the Court of Claims
on the subject, and added: "In this state of the record
the Court is in doubt whether an appeal is allowable, but
grants the appeal to give plaintiff the benefit of any doubt
upon the question."

MORSE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

Rule 90 of the Court of Claims provides as follows:
"Whenever it is desired to question the correctness or
the sufficiency of the court's findings of fact or its conclusions or to amend the same, the complaining party shall
file a motion which shall be known and may be considered
as a motion for a new trial. All grounds relied upon for
any or all of said objects shall be included in one motion.
After the court has announced its decision upon such
motion no other motion by the same party shall be filed
unless by leave of court. Motions for new trial, except
as provided by Section 1088 of the Revised Statutes (See.
175 of the Judicial Code) shall be filed within sixty days
from the time the judgment of the court is announced."
Section 243 of the Judicial Code, which was in force at
the time the appeal herein was taken, but which was later
repealed by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat.
936, provided as follows:
"All appeals from the Court of Claims shall be taken
within ninety days after the judgment is rendered, and
shall be allowed under such regulations as the Supreme
Court may direct."
It is clear from the sequence of dates above given that
more than ninety days elapsed between the overruling of
the motion for a new trial and application for appeal by
the appellant. The appellant contends that the motion
for leave to file a motion for a new trial, on June 9, 1924,
prevented the beginning of the period of limitation within
which application for an appeal could be made from the
judgment of the Court of Claims, and therefore that the
appeal taken on the 5th of September was within the
statutory ninety days.
There is no doubt under the decisions and practice in
this Court that where a motion for a new trial in i court
of law, or a petition for a rehearing in a court of equity,
is duly and seasonably filed, it suspends the running of
the time for taking a writ of error or an appeal, and that
the time within which the proceeding to review must be

initiated begins from the date of the denial of either the
motion or petition. Brockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238,

Memphis v. Brown, 94 U. S. 715, 718; Texas & Pacific

Railway v. Basham, 249 U. S. 164, 167. The suspension
of the running of the period limited for the allowance of
an appeal, after a judgment has been entered, depends
upon the due and seasonable filing of the motion for a
new trial or the petition for rehearing. In this case after
the first motion for a new trial had been overruled, on
May 4, 1924, no motion for a new trial could be duly and
seasonably filed under Rule 90 of the Court of Claims,
except upon leave of the Court of Claims. This leave,
though applied for twice, was not granted. Applications
for leave did not suspend the running of the ninety days
after the denial of the motion for a new trial within which
the application for appeal must hav been made. For
that reason, the motion of the Government to dismiss the
appeal as not in time, and so for lack of jurisdiction, must
be granted.
Appeal dismissed.
