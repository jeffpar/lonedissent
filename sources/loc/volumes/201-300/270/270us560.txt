CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE

OF'

PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 181.

Argued November 23, 24, 1925.-Decided April 12, 1926.

1. The state statute of limitations prescribing the time within which
a suit may be brought against a shareholder of a local corporation
to collect unpaid stock subscriptions for defrayal of- the corporation's debts applies when the suit is brought by a trustee of a
bankrupt corporation pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy
court assessing its shareholders. P. 564.
2. The nature, extent, and condition of the liability of a stockholder on account of the stock not full-paid, depend primarily on
the law of the State or country by which the corporation was
created. Id.
3. That law determines whether the liability is to the corporation
or to creditors; if to the corporation, the right passeg to its trustee
in bankruptcy; but the Bankrupt Law does not modify the right
or create a new one. Id.
4. By the law of Pennsylvania this liability of shareholders of a
Pennsylvania business corporation becomes fixed, so that the
statute of limitations . egins to run, as soon as it is definitely
ascertained that a company is insolvent and will be obliged to
call unpaid stock subscriptions 'in order to satisfy its obligations.

Kaye v. Metz, 47 A. B. R. 163. Before suit could be
brought against the respondent, there had to be some
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. As laid down
in Scovill v. Thayer, supra,and Harriganv. Bergdoll, 263
Fed. 279, it was the duty of the trustee-petitioner, in dealing with assets, to proceed under the direction of the
bankruptcy court. The trustee-petitioner could not have
maintained a plenary action against the respondent until
he had obtained the order for assessment, as he did. Being a trustee in a federal bankruptcy proceeding, the proceedings he took and the order he obtained were a right
given to, and exercised by, him under the authority of
a federal statute. Great Western Tel. Co. v. Purdy, 162

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Harrigan, trustee in bankruptcy of the Louis J. Bergdoll Motor Company, brought this suit in a state court
of Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1921, to recover $155,571.79
and interest from Bergdoll, a stockholder in the company.
The defendant, a resident of the State, pleaded the general
six-year statute of limitations. The claim sued on is the
assessment, ordered by. the bankruptcy court, of 51.85%
of the par value on shares in the company held by the
defendant, the amount being found by that court to be
unpaid on the stock and required to satisfy the liabilities.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The corporation had been organized under the laws of
Pennsylvania about April 1, 1912; had its place of business there; and was adjudged bankrupt in the federal
court for the eastern district of the State in April, 1913.
It was then insolvent. In May, 1913, it had become apparent that the company's liabilities largely exceeded its
assets other than the amounts unpaid on its capital stock.
The petition of the trustee to the bankruptcy court praying that the assessment be made, and that he be authorized to proceed to collect the same, was not filed until
October, 1917.
The application then made was strenuously opposed by
Bergdoll. The order for the assessment was entered by
the referee in February, 1918, but was not confirmed by
the District Court until July, 1919, 260 Fed. 234. That
was more than six years-after the deficiency had become
apparent. The judgment of the District Court, besides
making the assessment, ordered Bergdoll to pay the same.
On this ground, among others, Bergdoll appealed to the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals. In March, 1920,
that court affirmed the judgment insofar as it adjudicated
the necessity for an assessment, fixed the rate and levied
the same upon those who appeared prima facie to be subject thereto, but reversed the judgment insofar as it had
adjudged the personal liability of Bergdoll and the amount
thereof. 263 Fed. 279, 281, 283. Thereafter this suit was
brought in the state court. The trial court ruled that the
statute of limitations had run before the suit was instituted. Its judgment ywas affirmed by the highest court
of the State, 281 Pa. 186. This Court granted.a writ of
certiorari. 266 U. S. 598.
The reversal tby the Circuit Court of Appeals of the
judgment of the District Court insofar as it adjudged the
liability of Bergdoll was in accord with the rule, settled
in the third circuit and elsewhere, that the order of assessinent and levy is a purely administrative proceeding pre-

HARRIGAN v. BERGDOLL.

Opinion of the Court.

liminary to the institution of a suit; that in the absence
of consent there is no jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court
to fix the personal liability of a stockholder; and that any
person whose stock is assessed may when sued in a plenary
action on such assessment in any court of competent
jurisdiction make any defence thereto affecting his individual liability, but may not attack the administrative
order of the District Court in determining the need of an
assessment, or in levying the same. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, 162 U. S. 329, 336-7; In. re Remington
Automobile & Motor Co., 153 Fed. 345; In re Munger
Vehicle Tire Co., 168 Fed. 910; In re M. Stipp Construction Co., 221 Fed. 372. The District Court recognized
this rule. It erred, as the Court of Appeals held, in concluding that Bergdoll had consented to the exercise by the
bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to determine whether he
was personally liable.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the State holding
that the statute of limitations had run was said to be an
application of the state law, settled at least since Swearingen v. Sewickley Dairy Co., 198 Pa. 68, decided in 190!,
that the liability of a shareholder in a Pennsylvania business corporation to creditors of the company on account
of stock not full-paid becomes fixed at the time it is
definitely ascertained that the company is insolvent and
will be obliged to call unpaid stock subscriptions in order
to satisfy its obligations; that as soon 'as the deficiency of
assets becomes apparent, it becomes the duty of creditors,
if they desire to obtain payment of their claims, to take
the necessary steps to bring about a formal determination
of the extent of the assessment on unpaid stock subscriptions necessary to liquidate the indebtedness and also to
begin proper action to collect such amount from the respective stockholders within the time limited by the general statute of limitations. The sole question for decision
is whether the state law governs in view of the proceedings
had,in bankruptcy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The trustee contends that the statute of limitations
did not begin to run until March 27, 1920, the date of
the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which
confirmed the order making the assessment and authorized suit to collect it. This contention rests upon the
assumption that Bergdoll's liability remained contingent
until the entry of that judgment and, hence, that the
cause of action arose then. The highest court of Pennsylvania has held that assessment was not a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action; and that
the liability became absolute without an assessment,
either by the corporation or by any court, as soon as the
need of this asset for paying debts became apparent.
Compare Potts v. Wallace, 146 U. S. 689; Kelley v. Gill,
245 U. S. 116, 121. The nature, the extent, and the
conditions of the liability of a stockholder on account of
stock not full-paid depend primarily upon the law. of
the State or country by'which the corporation was created.
Glenn v. Liggett, 135 U. S. 533, 548. Compare Benedict
v. Ratner, 268 U. S. 353, 359.1 That law determines
whether the liability is to the corporation or is to creditors.2 Compare Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243,
253; Selig v. Hamilton, 234 U. S. 652, 658. If the liability
is to the corporation, it passes like other choses in action
to the trustee in bankruptcy. The Bankrupt Law does
not modify this right of action against the stockholder
or create a new one. It merely provides that the right
created by the state law shall pass to the trustee and be
enforced by him for the benefit of creditors. The order

of assessment and the direction that the trustee sue to
recover were appropriate administrative proceedings in
bankruptcy. See In re Miller ElectricalMaintenance Co.,
111 Fed. 515. But it wasfor the court of Pennsylvania
to say whether they were indispensable to the enforcement of the stockholder's liability.
Scovill v. Thayer, 105 U. S. 143, upon which the trustee
relied, is not inconsistent with the conclusion stated.
That was a suit brought in the federal court for Massachusetts to enforce the liability of a stockholder in a
Kansas corporation. The courts of Kansas had not
settled when the cause of action created by its law arose.
The trial court and this Court were, therefore, obliged
to decide that question of state law. See Burgess v.
Seligman, 107 U. S.20, 33.
