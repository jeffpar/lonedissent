COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 375. Argued March 10, 11, 1926.-Decided March 22, 1926.
1. The tax "with respect to carrying on or doing business," imposed on domestic corporations by Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1918,
held applicable to a corporation organized for the purpose of
holding the stock of a mining corporation, and of issuing and selling bonds secured by pledge of the stock and furnishing the proceeds from time to time to the other to enable it to carry on its
work, other activities of the holding company consisting of maintaining an office, voting the shares, electing directors, lending the
proceeds of bonds through a trust company on call loans when
not needed for advances to the mining company, collecting interest, etc. P. 455.
2. Where a single business can not be carried on without two corporations taking part in it, each, under the above acts, must pay
a tax. P.456.
5 Fed. (2d) 1014, reversed.
CERTIORARI to a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
which affirmed a decree in the District Court (294 Fed.

v. Dixon, 173 U. S. 113, 114, that "the mere order of the Circuit
Court appointing a receiver did not create a Federal question," held
in Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville Ry. Co., 179 U. S. 335,
that no removal could be allowed solely on the ground of the receiver
having secured his appointment from a federal court. That case and
the limitations it established have since been consistently recognized
and followed. Pepper v. Rogers, 128 Fed. 987; People of New York
v. Bleecker St. & F. F. R. Co., 178 Fed. 156; Wrightsville Hardware

principle of the decision, as there stated by the Court, 179 U. S.

581) for the Copper Company in an action to recover
from the collector the amount of taxes alleged to have
been erroneously collected.
Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, with whom

the brief, for the United States.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes alleged
to have been erroneously collected for the years 1917 to
1920. The taxes were levied under the Acts of September
8, 1916, c. 463, ยง 407, 39 Stat. 756, 789, and of February
24, 1919, c. 18, ยง 1000, (a) (1) and (c), 40'Stat. 1057,
1126. Both statutes impose upon domestic corporations
organized for profit a tax 'with respect to carrying on
or doing business,' at certain rates for a fair value of the
capital stock, and both exempt such corporations 'not
engaged in business' during the preceding taxable year.
The question is whether the plaintiff, the Chile Copper
Company, brings itself within this exemption. The facts
are set forth in the complaint and the case was heard
upon a motion to dismiss. In the District Court judgment was given for the plaintiff, 294 Fed. Rep. 581. The
judgment was affirmed on the opinion below by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 F. (2d) 1014. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 268 U. S. 685.
The facts are somewhat peculiar. The Chile Exploration Company, a New Jersey corporation, owned mines
in Chile and needed to borrow large sums of money in
order to develop them. By the laws of Chile it could not
mortgage its mines effectively and therefore could not

give security directly for bonds. To meet the difficulty
the Chile Copper Company was organized in Delaware
for the purpose of holding the capital stock of the Chile
Exploration Company, issuing bonds secured by a niedge
of the stock, and furnishing the proceeds from time to
time to the Exploration Company to enable the latter to
go on with its work. The purpose was carried out. On
April 1, 1917, the plaintiff authorized the issue of collateral trust bonds for $100,000,000 to be secured by a
pledge of all the above-mentioned stock. During the six
months ending on June 30, 1917, it executed an agreement
with underwriters and issued $35,000,000 of the bonds,
received payments from subscribers, which were deposited
in a special account with the Guaranty Trust Company
of New York, paid. the expenses of issue from the special
account and made provision for the accrued interest payable upon the bonds. It also paid the interest on
$15,000,000 of bonds outstanding under an earlier pledge.
During the same time stockholders' and directors' meetings
were held, directors and officers were chosen, corporate
books and accounting records were kept, and such other
acts were done and expenses paid as were necessary to
keep up the corporate existence. An office was maintained for the activities described. The plaintiff owned
and voted on the stock of the Exploration Company, and
elected its directors, and made advances to it from the
proceeds of the bonds issued in 1917, the Guaranty Trust
Company being directed after payment of certain matters
not to pay checks drawn upon the special account unless
accompanied by a letter from the plaintiff stating that
the proceeds would be used for specified purposes connected with the development of the mines. The plaintiff
agreed to furnish and did furnish the Guaranty Company
statements showing that the proceeds had been so applied. During the six months mentioned the sum of
$1,250,000 was advanced to the Exploration Company, and

interest upon loans and a part of the bond discount paid
by it to the plaintiff and payments on account of a dividend also were made.
The activities for succeeding years were similar, advances of the Exploration Company being made each
year. The plaintiff had funds received from the issue of
bonds in 1917, in excess of the amounts that it thought
proper to advance during the given period to the Exploration Company. A part of these it invested in Liberty
Bonds, but the greater part, which it had deposited with
the Guaranty Trust Company and the Central Union
Trust Company, it authorized those companies to lend on
call in the plaintiff's name and at its risk, taking security.
If the security was not satisfactory the plaintiff directed
the Trust Company to call the loan. During the year
ending June 30, 1920, 224 loans amounting to $37,200,000
were made and 180 loans amounting to $29,100,00
were called. In the same year the plaintiff received
$332,366.90 as interest upon these loans. During the
previous year it received $194,579.20 upon similar loans.
If the corporation was one that Congress had power
to tax in this way, it is hard to say that it is not within
the taxing acts. It was organized for profit and was doing
what it principally was organized to do in order to realize profit. The cases must be exceptional, when such
activities of such corporations do not amount to doing
business in the sense of the statutes. The exemption
'when not engaged in business' ordinarily would seem
pretty nearly equivalent to when not pursuing the ends
for which the corporation was organized, in the cases
where the end is profit. In our opinion the plaintiff was
liable to the tax. We do not rest our conclusion upon the
issue of bonds in the first year or the call loans made in
the last, and for the same reasons we cannot let the fagot
be destroyed by taking up each item of conduct separately
and breaking the stick. The activities and situation must

be judged as a whole. Looking at them as a whole we
see that the plaintiff was a good deal more than a mere
conduit for the Chile Exploration Company. It was its
brain or at least the efferent nerve without which that
company could not move. The plaintiff owned and by
indirection governed it, and was its continuing support,
by advances from time to time in the plaintiff's discretion.
There was some suggestion that there was only one business and therefore ought to be only one tax. But if the
one business could not be carried on without two corporations taking part in it, each must pay, by the plain
words of the Act. The case is not governed by McCoach
v. Minehill & Schuylkill Haven R. R. Co., 228 U. S. 295,
and United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Co.,
237 U. S. 28. It is nearer to Von Baumbach v. Sargent
Land Co., 242 U. S. 503.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND took nQ part in the decision
of this case.

SMITH v. McCULLOUGH

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 22.

Argued October 8, 1925.-Decided March 22, 1926.

1. Whatever is essential to federal jurisdiction must be alleged in
the complaint; otherwise the suit must be dismissed, unless the
defect in the complaint be cured by amendment. P. 459.
2. Where the jurisdiction depended on the existence of a dispute
over the construction of federal statutes, which was not properly
shown in the bill, but which was the principal controversy in several trials in which jurisdiction was assumed to exist by the courts
and both parties, and this appeared by the record-held that the
defect was amendable and would be treated as amended in this
Court. P. 459.
