FIRST MOON v. WHITE TAIL AND UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 191.

Argued January 29, 1926.--Decided March 1, 1926.

1 A decision of the Secretary of the Interior determining who are

the heirs of an Indian allottee, who died intestate after receiving
his trust patent under the General Allotment Act and before issuance of a fee simple patent, is made conclusive by the Act of
June 10, 1910; and the District Court is without jurisdiction to reexamine it for alleged error of law. So held, in a suit against an
adverse claimant and the United States. P. 243.
2. The Act of December 21, 1911, amending ยง 24 of the Judicial
Code and conferring on District Courts jurisdiction of actions involving the rights of persons of Indian blood or descent to allotments, was but a codification of earlier provisions, and refers to
original allotments claimed under some law or treaty, and not to
disputes concerning the heirs of one who held a valid and unquestioned allotment. P. 244.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.

. Appellant seeks to establish an interest in certain lands

allotted to Little Soldier, a Ponca Indian, under the General Allotment Act of 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, as

amended by the Act of 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794. Trust

Opinion of the Court.

patents were issued therefor in 1895, and he died March
1, 1919. It appears from the bill that the Secretary of
the Interior after due consideration determined who
were the heirs, and in doing so eliminated appellant,
although she claimed to be the only surviving lawful wife.
It is alleged that upon the facts found by him the Secretary misapplied the law.
The court below held, correctly we think, that it was
without jurisdiction, since the matter had been entrusted
to the exclusive cognizance of the Secretary of the Interior by the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, 36 Stat. 855, which
provides: "That when any Indian to whom'an allotment
of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies
before the expiration of the trust period and before the
issuance of a fee simple patent, without having made a
will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided,
the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing,
under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the
legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon
shall be final and conclusive."
The question presented must be regarded as settled by
what this court has said in Hallowell v. Commons, 239
U. S. 506; Lane v. Mickadiet, 241 U. S. 201; United
States v. Bowling, 256 U. S. 484. The legislative history
of the Act of 1910-Cong. Rec. vol. 45, p. 5811-lends
supJ~ort to this construction; and abundant reason for the
provision becomes apparent upon consideration of the
infinite difficulties which otherwise would arise in connection with the sundry duties of the Secretary of the Interior relative to Indian allotments.
We cannot accept the suggestion that the above-quoted
exclusive feature of the Act of 1910, was repealed by the
Act of December 21, 1911, c. 5, 37 Stat. 46, which amended
ยง 24 Judicial Code and conferred upon District Courts
jurisdiction "of all actions, suits, or proceedings involving
the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian

blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any law

Stat. 305, as amended by the Act of February 6, 1901, c.

ISELIN v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 119.

Argued January 12, 1926.-Decided March 1, 1926.

1. Par. 3 of ยง 800(a) of Revenue Act of 1918, laying taxis on theater
and opera tickets sold at newstands, hotels, etc., for more than
the "established price" at the ticket office of the theater or
opera house, held inapplicable to sale by a stockholder of box
tickets, issued as an incident of his investment in an opera house
company, which were not sold at the box-office and for which there
was no established price. P. 247.
2. A statute imposing taxes with particularity, and in plain, unambiguous language, cannot be enlarged by construction to cover
other cases omitted through presumable inadvertence of the legislature. P. 250.
3. An administrative practice which enlarges the scope of an unambiguous statute, and which is neither uniform, general, nor long
continued, can not be given legal force or effect, nor be accepted
as a reason why subsequent reenactment of the statute without
change should be taken as a legislative interpretation of its original
meaning as justifying such practice. P. 251.
59 Ct. Cls. 654, reversed.
