No. 401.

The United States appeals from a judgment against it
for $14,236.04. December 3, 1920, the Philadelphia &
Reading Railway Company, to which plaintiff, the Reading Company, is successor, brought this action to recover
its charges for transportation of troops and military impedimenta by that company and connecting carriers prior
to federal control of railroads. When the railroads were
taken over, the United States owed the company
$24,900.01 for that transportation.
Federal control of railroads commenced December 28,
1917, and ended March 1, 1920. Pursuant to the Federal
Control Act, approved March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451,
the Director General, February 18, 1920, entered into the
standard form contract with the Philadelphia & Reading
and its affihiated companies. It was agreed that the President took the company's accounts receivable as of midnight, December 31, 1917; that all amounts collected by
the Director General on account of receivables should be
credited by him to the company; that he was authorized,
to the extent of cash realized upon the company's assets
then on hand, to pay and charge to the company expenses
growing otit of operation prior to federal control, including reparation claims; that, unless objected to by the company, he might pay and charge to the company expenses
and claims in excess of the cash so realized, and that, at
the end of federal control, the Director General should
return to the company all uncollected accounts.

UNITED STATES v. READING CO.
320

Opinion of the Court.

Prior to June 14, 1918, there was paid by the disbursing officer of the army to the Director General, $26,157.20
on account of the bills for transportation before federal
control. February 18, 1920, the auditor of the War Department deducted $1257.19--as to which there is no
controversy-from the Direc or General's bills for transportation during federal control, and the latter reimbursed himself by deducting that amount from the
$26,157.20 paid him by the disbursing officer, leaving in
his hands, a balance of $24,900.01.
June 18, 1918, the Comptroller ruled (24 Comp. Dec.
774) that, for each twenty-five officers and enlisted men
traveling, the United States was entitled to a free car for
the transportation of camp equipment and property. But
that decision was erroneous; and it was so held, June 13,
1921. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 56 Ct.
Cls. 341, 348.
At different times in 1920, prior to July 16, the auditor
of the War Department, in order to adjust payments to
the basis of the Comptroller's ruling, disallowed as overpayments items aggregating $14,236.04 of the amount
paid by the disbursing officer to the Director General, and
took that amount from pending Railroad Administration
bills for transportation during federal control. The
Director General deducted the same amount from the
$24,000.01 remaining in his hands, leaving a balance of
only $10,663.97 which was credited to the company in the
account "Assets, December 31, 1917, collected." February 24, 1920, the Director General promulgated General
Order No. 66, providing for accounting incident to the
termination of federal .ontrol. This order (§ 5a) directed that, where there were paid out of federal funds
overcharge freight claims in respect of traffic, the revenues
from which were included in corporate revenue, the
amounts should be charged on the federal books to the
corporation in the account "Corporate transactions," and

324

Opinion of the Court.

on the corporate books such amounts should be charged
to an appropriate suspense account and credited to the
United States in a corresponding account. This required
the amount of the deduction, $14,236.04, so to be charged
and credited.
August 25, 1920, the War Department paid the Railroad Administration a large sum in full settlement for all
transportation during federal control. Thereupon, the
Director General issued accounting circular 152, which
announced the settlement, and stated: "Special attention
is directed to the fact that the settlement above referred
to involves the War Department only; . . . and does not
include bills rendered in the Federal accounts for transportation service performed prior to Federal control," and
directed that unpaid bills for such transportation "shall
not be closed into the account 'War Department transportation" charges,' but instead shall be charged to the
corporation through the account '(Name of corporation)-Corporate transactions '."
The Court of Claims found that, "The final account of
the final settlement between the Director General of Railroads and the plaintiff reads as follows: 'United States

which the said director general, or any one representing

or claim against the said companies, or any of them,
growing out of or connected with the possession, use, and
operation of the companies' property by the United States
during the period of Federal control, or out of the contract
between the parties dated the 18th day of February, 1920;
and the said companies, both jointly and severally, hereby
acknowledge the return to and receipt by them of all their
property and rights which they are entitled to, and further acknowledge that the director general has fully and
completely complied with and satisfied all obligations on
his part, or on the part of the United States, or the United
States Railroad Administration, growing out of Federal
control."
"The purpose and effect of this instrument is to evidence a complete and final settlement of all demands, of
every kind and character, as between the parties hereto,
growing out of the Federal control of railroads, save and
except that the following matters are not included in this
adjustment and are not affected thereby. . . . [The
exceptions specified do not include the claim in suit.]"
The United States contends that payment by the War
Department of the company's bills to the Director General charged him with liability for the money, and that,
when he paid part to the company, and the latter executed the contract in final settlement of all demands of
every kind and character growing out of federal control,
the United States was released from the remainder.
By this instrument, the company acknowledged that
the Director General had returned to it all its property
and rights and had satisfied all obligations on his part or
on the part of the United States or the Railroad Administration "growing out of Federal control "; and it declared
that the purpose of the agreement was to evidence a final

328

270 U. S.

settlement of all demands "as between the parties hereto,
growing out of the Federal control of railroads." The
United States relies on the phrase "growing out of Federal control" to show that plaintiff's claim was an obligation or demand included ini the settlement. The phrase
is general and, if considered independently of context and
the transactions which led up to the agreement, its meaning would be too indefinite and vague to have any significance. The surrounding circumstances must be considered. Reed v. Insurance Company, 95 U. S. 23, 30.
The President, as a war measure, took possession and the
use of the transportation systems of the country. The
taking was temporary. The Federal Control Act authorized agreements in respect of compensation for the use of
the property. The Transportation Act of 1920, § 202,
c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 459, directed that, as soon as practicable after the termination of federal control, the President should settle and wind up all matters "arising out
of or incident to Federal control." A Director General
was appointed and a Railroad Administration was created
to unify control of all the properties for the more efficient
transportation of troops aid war materials. All control
was taken out of the hands of the companies; but the
Director General made use of their former organizations,
officials and employees. When the transfer of control
was made, it was convenient for all concerned-if not
indeed necessary-that freight bills then remaining unpaid should be handled by the persons in charge of the
operating propei'ties. There was no expropriation of the
companies' accounts receivable for transportation before
federal control. They did not become the property of
the United States. Amounts collected or paid out by the
Director General on account of assets or liabilities of the
companies existing or arising before federal control were
dealt with separately and respectively credited and
charged to the companies. In making such collections

UNITED STATES v. READING CO.
320

Opinion of the Court.

and disbursements, the Director General acted in respect
of the affairs of the company which were wholly distinct
from transactions arising from operation during federal
control.
The War Department made use of Railroad Administration bills to retake the supposed overcharges. The
effect was the same as if $14,236.04 had been .deducted
before payment directly from the company's bills. Assuming that he had the power, the Director General did
not undertake to settle questions between the War Department and the company in respect of freight bills for
transportation before federal control. Accounting Circular 152 shows that the Railroad Administration did not
attempt to secure the release of the War Department
from liability for the unpaid balance owing on company
bills. The Director General's charge of $14,236.04 against
the company in the corporate transactions account was
the same as if the company had paid the amount in cash
to the Railroad Administration to make it whole in respect of its efforts to collect the company's bills. So far
as the book entries are concerned, the company retained
its claim for transportation against the United States;
and plaintiff is entitled to recover unless the Philadelphia
& Reading gave up its claim by the final settlement
agreement.
But the Government contends that "the final account
of the final settlement" cannot be considered, and argues
that it purports only to adjust claims to March 31, 1922,
while the "final settlement" agreement was made June
30, 1922; that these documents have no relation to each
other, and that the account deals only with details,
whereas the contract of settlement embraces all demands,
whether included in the account or not. These contentions are not sustained. The findings of fact must be
accepted. The court found that: "The final account of
the final settlement

.

.

reads as follows;" this is

330

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

unequivocal; the meaning is plain, and there is no room
for exposition. The only sum included for the company's
transportation before federal control is $10,663.97. The
amount retaken, $14,236.04, was charged to the company.
In final settlement, the company paid $8,000,000, the
exact sum stated in the final account.
Obviously, the transportation for which claim is made,
and the auditor's ruling that the disbursing officer made
overpayment, did not grow out of federal control. And,
if collection of company bills by the Director General
otherwise might be deemed to have been incident to federal control, the book entries and the final account show
that the balance owing for the transportation in question
belonged to the company. By the standard form of contract, the Director General was bound, at the termination
of federal control, to return to the company all uncollected
accounts. This action was pending more than a year and
a half when the settlement was made. If the parties
intended to settle the claim sued on, a dismissal of the
action by consent should have followed. The transactions
out of which the Auditor's erroneous deductions grew
did not concern the Railroad Administration; and, in
respect of them, there never was any question between it
and the company. Plaintiff's claim was in no sense an
obligation or demand against the Railroad Administration
or the United States in respect of the federal control of
railroads. The facts make it clear that the final agreement did not release the United States from liability for
the freight charges in question.
No. 402.
This is the Reading Company's cross appeal. On the
findings, it claims judgment for $6,990.92 additional.
Certain bills prepared by the company were based on
Class A rates on military impedimenta. These bills were
restated by the company without protest on the basis of

UNITED STATES v. READING CO.
320

. Opinion of the Court.

Class D rates with land grant deductions. The restated
bills were paid. Certain other bills for like transportation
were originally stated on the basis of Class D rates with
land grant deductions and were paid. And other bills for
similar service were withdrawn and restated for lesser
sums; the amounts so claimed were paid. The facts
found by the Court of Claims are not sufficient to justify
any recovery, and bring the case presented on cross appeal
within the ruling in Oregon-Washington R. R. Co. v.
United States, 255 U. S. 339, 345; Louisville & Nashville
R. R. v. United States, 267 U. S. 395, 401; C., M. & St. P.
Ry. v. United States, 267 U. S. 403. The cross appeal is
without merit.
No. 403.
The United States appeals from a judgment against it
for $48,439.68. This case is similar to No. 401. In 1916
and 1917, plaintiff, Southern Railway Company, transported military impedimenta for the United States, and
presented its bills therefor. The disbursing officer of the
army paid some of them to plaintiff in 1917; and, after
the plaintiff's railroad was taken over, paid others to the
Director General. These amounts were credited on federal books to plaintiff as "revenue prior to January 1,
1918." The Auditor of the War Department, following a
ruling made by the Comptroller, June 18, 1918, held that
the disbursing officer had made overpayments on account
of these bills amounting to $48,439.68; and, to recover
the supposed overpayments, deductions were made at
different times from the bills of the Railroad Administra,tion for transportation during federal control. Then the
Director General charged the amount of these deductions
to plaintiff-in an account designated "Corporate transactions "; and they were credited to the Railroad Administration on the books of plaintiff in a corresponding
account.

332

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The auditor's finding that overpayments were made was
erroneous. Plaintiff was entitled to the amounts paid by
the disbursing officer. The Government's sole contention
is that the final settlement in respect of matters growing
out of federal control, operated to discharge the claim
sued on. The Court of Claims incorporated in its findings the final account of the final settlement between the
Director General and the plaintiff. Its form is substantially the same as that set out in the margin in No. 401.
At the top of the statement, there is this notation,
"[Final settlement contract, June 22, 1921]."
The
amount admitted by the plaintiff to be due the Railroad
Administration on the account "Corporate transactions"
was less than the amount claimed by the Railroad Administration. But the Court of Claims expressly found
that prior to the settlement the parties agreed upon the
smaller amount, and that there was no compromise of the
amount charged against the plaintiff in "Corporate transactions "; that the full amount charged by the Railroad
Administration was paid by the plaintiff, and included
therein was the sum of $48,439.68, deducted from Railroad Administration bills on account of supposed overpayments of plaintiff's bills. The final settlement agreement was made June 22, 1921. It is in the same form
and, so far as concerns the matters here in controversy,
has the same force and effect as that quoted in No. 401.
That decision controls this case.
No. 404.
The United States appeals from a judgment for
$15,143.91. This case is similar to Nos. 401 and 403.
In 1916 and 1917 plaintiff, the St. Louis, Brownsville &
Mexico Railway Company, and connecting carriers, transported military impedimenta for the United States, and
plaintiff presented bills therefor. The disbursing officer
of the army paid some of them to plaintiff in 1917.
When auditing the disbursing officer's account, the

UNITED STATES v. READING CO.
320

Opinion of the Court.

Auditor of the War Department erroneously disallowed
payments made by him; and, pending settlement of the
account, the company's railroad was taken over by the
President. In order to recover the supposed overpayments, the auditor deducted $15,143.91 from bills of the
Railroad Administration for transportation during federal
control, $13,035.97 during federal control, and the balance
later. The Railroad Administration charged the amount
deducted against plaintiff in the account "Corporate
transactions" in accordance with General Order No. 66,
and that amount was credited to the Railroad Administration and charged against the War Department on the
plaintiff's books. There was a final settlement agreement
between the Director General and the plaintiff dated July
29, 1921. The final account of settlement was made as
of May 31, 1921. It consisted of a comparison of claims
submitted by the plaintiff with the books of the central
administration adjusted to that date. The court expressly found that there was no dispute as to the amount
due from plaintiff to the Railroad Administration on the
account "Corporate transactions," and that the same was
paid in full in the final settlement. Included in the
amount was the sum of $15,143.91 deducted from Railroad Administration bills on account of supposed overpayments. The final account relates to the settlement
agreement. The agreement shows that the Director General paid the company the exact amount shown by the
final account to be due the corporation according to the
Administration books. The agreement is in the same
form and, so far as concerns the matters herein controversy, has the same force and effect, as that quoted in
No. 401. That decision controls in this case.

versy is $9,160.89. In 1916 and 1917 plaintiff, the New
Haven, and connecting carriers transported certain military impedimenta. on government bills of lading; and
plaintiff, as last carrier, presented its bills therefor.
Plaintiff's transportation system was taken over by the
President, December 28, 1917. The disbursing officer of
the army paid some of these bills to plaintiff before, and
some to the Railroad Administration after, the railroads
were taken over. In auditing the accounts of the disbursing officer, the Auditor of the War Department, following the erroneous ruling of the Comptroller (24 Comp.
Dec. 774) disallowed as overpayments $9,160.89 of the
amount paid on these bills. The plaintiff refused to
refund. Then, in order to recover the supposed overpayments, the auditor deducted from the bills of the Railroad Administration presented to the disbursing officer,
$7,295.54 during, and $1,865.35 after, federal control.
The total was charged on the books of the Railroad Admiinistration to the plaintiff. General Order No. 68
created a trustee account to take effect at the termination
of federal control, midnight February 29, 1920. By this
order, railroads that had been under federal control were
made trustees of the Railroad Administration to collect
its unpaid bills, to pay its liabilities, and generally to wind
up its unfinished business. The cash pertaining to the
transportation business was turned over to the railroads
to be carried to that account; and money erroneously paid
into the trustee account by deposit could be withdrawn
by the consent of the Director General. In January,
1921, plaintiff paid into the trustee account $9,160.89 to
make good to the Railroad Administration the deductions
erroneously made by the Auditor of the War Department;
and on its own books plaintiff charged that amount to the
War Department. March 21, 1922, this action was
commenced.
October 26, 1923, there was a final settlement between
the plaintiff and the Director General consisting of a final

account and agreement. The form of the account is
similar to that printed in the margin in No. 401. And
that agreement, so far as concerns the Government's
insistence that plaintiff released the claim in suit,
contains the same language as that quoted and discussed in No. 401; and in this case the agreement
contains an exception: "This settlement does not include or affect any moneys or assets of the Director
General turned over to the company pursuant to General Order No. 68, the account created by this order
to be adjusted as though this agreement had not been
made."
There was no overpayment on account of plaintiff's
bills. Plaintiff was entitled to the amount paid by the
disbursing officer, and rightly refused to refund. The
effect of the auditor's deductions was to compel the Railroad Administration to refund for account of llantiff the
amount of the supposed overpayments. The amount so
refunded was rightly charged to plaintiff, and was repaid
by deposit in the trustee account. The agreement expressly excluded that account and. left it to be adjusted
as if no settlement had been made. The transaction out
of which the auditor's deductions arose did not concern
the Railroad Administration; and, in respect of that
matter, there never was any question or dispute between it
and plaintiff. The matter in controversy was wholly between the War Department and plaintiff. The effect of
the exception quoted w~s to exclude plaintiff's claim from
the settlement, and to leave the plaintiff free to continue
to prosecute this action to recover the amount erroneously
deducted as overpayments on plaintiff's bills. And plaintiff's claim was in no sense an obligation or a demand
against the United States in respect of the federal control
*of railroads.
No. 399 and No. 400 are controlled by our decision in
this case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

No. 499 AND No. 500.
No. 499 is an appeal by the United States from a judgment against it for $18,796.68. The amount here in-volved is $16,588.13. 'The transportation system of plaintiff, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, was taken
over by the President December 28, 1917, and federal
control continued until March 1, 1920. In 1916 and
1917, plaintiff and connecting carriers transported troops
upon government transportation requests. Plaintiff, as
initial carrier, presented bills therefor based on net per
capita fares obtained by combinations only on the western
gateways specified in the interterritorial military arrangements of 1916 and 1917. Payments amounting to $289,774.89 were made by the proper disbursing officer.- Some
of these payments, $172,210.31, were made to plaintiff
before federal control. The balance were made during
federal control to the Director General, and were credited
to plaintiff. The Auditor of the War Department, in
auditing .the accounts of the disbursing officer, disallowed
as overpayments on account of these bills, $20,978.45;
and, at different times from March 12 to September 17,
1920, deducted from bills of the Railroad Administration
the amount of the supposed overpayments. These deductions, to the amount of $16,588.13, were obtained by
routing not authorized by the interterritorial military
arrangements. The disallowances were held erroneous on
the authority of Atchison &c. Ry. v. United States, 256
U. S. 205. The Government does not support them. The
Court of Claims held that deductions made by the auditor
amounting to $4,390.32 were proper; and, as no cross
appeal was taken, they are not here involved.
Of the total amount deducted, plaintiff refunded $13.58
to the War Department; and the Railroad Administration
charged back to plaintiff $20,939.52 through the account
"Federal assets collected," and $25.35 through the account "Corporate transactions."

UNITED STATES v. READING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

In December, 1921, the plaintiff paid into the trustee
account, created in accordance with General Order No. 68,
to the credit of the Administration, $20,939.52, and
charged that amount against the War Department.
July 27, 1922, there was a final settlement between.the
Director General and the plaintiff. That agreement, so
far as concerns the Government's insistence that plaintiff
released the claim in suit, contains the same language as
that quoted in No. 401. The agreement also contains an
exception in the same language, and having the same force
and effect, as that quoted in No. 398. Our decisions in
those cases are controlling here.
No. 500 is also c6ntrolled by them.
No. 36.
This is an appeal by the plaintiff, the Pere Marquette,
from a judgment that it is not entitled to recover. In
1917, plaintiff transported military impedimenta on Government bills of lading, and presented its bill, based on
lawfully published tariffs less land grant deductions,
amounting to $3,828.08. The disbursing officer paid that
amount to plaintiff. Subsequently, the Auditor of the
War Department, following a decision of the Comptroller,
erroneously disallowed the full amount. The plaintiff's
railroad was then 'under federal control, and the auditor
deducted an equal amount from sums due the Railroad
Administration for transportation in October and November, 1918. The Government does not support the auditor's disallowance of plaintiff's claim or the deduction of
an equivalent amount from the Railroad Administration.
July, 1920, in an adjustment of accounts between plaintiff and the Railroad Administration, the amount in question was credited by plaintiff to the Railroad Administration, and it remains outstanding on plaintiff's books as an
unpaid balance on its bill, paid, but afterwards disallowed
by the auditor. November 12, 1921, a final settlement

was made between the plaintiff .and the Railroad Administration. The contract contains the same general language in respect of the purpose of the instrument as that
considered in our decision in No. 401.
This action was commenced, September 2, 1921, and
on December 10, 1923, the Court of Claims gave judgment, citing Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States,
and Philadelphia& Reading R. R. v. United States, decided in that court, November 5, 1923. But in the Louisville & Nashville Case the judgment was vacated; and, on
rehearing, a judgment was entered in favor of the company, April 26, 1925. After the appeal in the case at
bar, new trials were granted by the Court of Claims in
other similar cases, which had been decided for the United
States, and, January 5, 1925, judgment was entered for
plaintiff in each. Appeals were taken by the United
States; motions to advance were granted. This case and
the others decided with it were argued and submitted at
the same time.
The Government contends that there is no finding that
plaintiff repaid the Railroad Administration the amount
erroneously deducted by the auditor; that the book
entries are not sufficient evidence of repayment, and that
it was the intention of the settlement agreement to include this claim as one growing out of federal control.
But the finding is that plaintiff gave appropriate credit
to the Railroad Administration, and that plaintiff's books
show its bill has not been paid. General Order No.. 66,
General Order No. 68, and Accounting Circular 152 were
promulgated by the Railroad Administration for general
application. It is to be presumed that the rules there laid
down were followed; that the amount in question was
charged back to plaintiff on the federal books, and that
settlement was made on that basis& Moreover, if it had
been the intention of the settlement agreement to include
this claim as one growing out of federal control, a consent

UNITED STATES v. COHN.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 130.

Submitted January 13, 1926.-Decided March 1, 1926.

1. Obtaining the possession of non-dutiable goods from a collector is
not obtaining the approval of a " claim upon or against" the

Government, within the meaning of § 65 of the Pefial Code, as
amended October 23, 1918. P. 345.
2. Neither is the wrongful obtaining of such goods from a collector
a "defrauding" of the Government within the meeting of this
section, since it deals with defrauding only in the primary sense
of cheating out of property or money; therein differing from
§ 37, which extends to conspiracies to defraud in he secondary
sense of obstructing governmental functions by fraudulent means.
