Syllabus.

uniform or commonly accepted rule of international law;
and Congress had power to authorize the action irrespective of any general views theretofore advanced in behalf
of this government. Certainly all courts within the
United States must recognize the legality of the seizure;
the duly expressed will of Congress when proceeding
within its powers is the supreme law of the land.
Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch 110, 122---" That war
gives to the sovereign full right to take the pr-sons and
confiscate the property of the enemy wherever found, is
conceded. The mitigations of this rigid rule, which the
humane and wise policy of modern times has introduced
into practice, will more or less affect the exercise of this
right, but cannot impair the right itself. That remains
undiminished, and when the sovereign authority shall
chuse to bring it into operation, the judicial department
must give effect to its will. But until that will shall be
expressed, no power of condemnation can exist in the
Court." See Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268; The

APPEAL from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
which affirmed a decree of the District Court dismissing
the bill in a suit to establish an interest in a tract of land

Mr. William Whitwell Dewhurst, for appellants.
Mr. Frederick M. Hudson, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
By a bill filed April 7, 1920, appellants sought to establish their right to one-half interest in 175 acres of land
on Key Biscayne, Dade County, Fla., granted by Governor White to Pedro Fornells January 18, 1805, when the
Floridas were under the dominion of Spain. Appellee
Deering acquired legal title to the whole tract June 28,
1913.
In 1824, under claim of ownership through conveyance
from Raphael Andreu, stepson of Fornells and alleged by
her to be his sole heir, Mary Ann Davis obtained confirmation of the grant in herself by the Board of Commissioners empowered under the Act of March 3, 1823, c. 29,
3 Stat. 754, to ascertain and confirm title to East Florida
lands arising under patents, grants, concessions or orders
of survey dated prior to January 24, 1818. The Board's
action was approved and confirmed by Act of February 8,
1827, c. 9, 4 Stat. 202. In 1847 the lands were surveyed
under direction of the Surveyor General and segregated
from the public domain.
June 30, 1827, Mrs. Davis and her husband deeded
three acres to the United States and the Cape Florida
Lighthouse was constructed thereon. They subsequently
abandoned the light and, March 4, 1903, conveyed the
three acxes to Waters S. Davis, one of the heirs of Mary
Ann Davis whose death occurred in 1885. He had purchased the interests of all other heirs during 1893. April

Opinion of the Court.

Davis, but this was not delivered until 1898 because of
protest by Venancio Sanchez, who claimed an interest.
This protest was overruled by the Surveyor General, the
Land Commissioner and the Secretary of the Interior.
June 28, 1913, Waters S. Davis deeded the lands to
Deering.
Complainants deraign their title to an undivided onehalf interest through deed to Venancio Sanchez from Antonia Porsila (or Porala), daughter of Pedro Fornells and
half sister of Raphael Andreu, executed by her May 26,
1843. About 1840 the husband of Mary Ann Davis
sought to interest Sanchez, then and long afterwards a
merchant at St. Augustine, Fla., in developing Key Biscayne. As a result, it is alleged, Sanchez discovered that
Mrs. Davis did not own the entire property and that Antonia Porsila had inherited an interest therein. Accordingly he went to Havana anAl there secured the conveyance of the latter's interest.
Sanchez died in 1899. He knew Raphael Andreu, who
lived for a long time at St. Augustine and probably died
there, but the time is not shown. It does not appear
when Antonia Porsila died.
Complainants sought to meet the anticipated defense
of laches by alleging that they were not able to secure
legal evidence of the relationship between Raphael Andreu and Antonia Porsila until the discovery of an index
to the Spanish archives during the year 1919;
The trial court dismissed the bill upon motion, holding
that appellants were chargeable with laches because of
the long delay in seeking relief after issuance of the patent of 1896. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this
decree upon the view that the delay extended from the
survey of 1847 when Mary Ann Davis secured full legal
title. 298 Fed. 286.
Under circumstances very similar to those here presented Wilson Cypress Co. v. Marcos, 236 U. S. 635, holds

that confirmation of the Spanish grant by Congress followed by survey of the land passed the legal title. We
can see no reason to depart from this view. The title of
Mary Ann Davis dates from 1847. For more than seventy years thereafter appellants and their predecessors
failed to assert their rights, if any, by legal proceedings.
We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals "that it is
too late now to enter into the merits of a claim of title
which could have been asserted and enforced if good, and
rejected if bad, while the witnesses who knew about it
were living and could have testified with reference to it."
The decree is
Affirmed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.

No. 146.

Argued January 18, 1926.-Decided March 1, 1926.

1. A conclusive statutory presumption that all gifts of a material

part of a decedent's estate made by him within six years of his
death were made in contemplation of death,-whereby they become
,subjected, without regard to his actual intent in making the gifts,
to graduated inheritpnce taxes,-creates an arbitrary classification and conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 239.
2. Such arbitrary classification, and consequent taxation, can not be
sustained upon the ground that legislative discretion found them
necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. P. 240.
3. The State is forbidden to deny due process of law, or the equal
protection of the laws, for any purpose whatever; and a forbidden
tax can not be enforced in order to facilitate the collection of one
properly laid. Id.
184 Wise. 1, reversed.
ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin sustaining an inheritance tax.
