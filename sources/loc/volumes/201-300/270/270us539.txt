treaties are not likely to intermeddle with the consequences of voluntary arrangements, if the right is given,
as here it was given by other statutes, to sue for death
wrongfully caused, at least unless those arrangements
made by third persons take away that right. It looks
somewhat as if in the first stages of this case that right
was supposed to be taken away; but, if so, the question
was not saved, and the only question before us is whether
the plaintiffs can recover under the Compensation Act,
not whether they could recover for a wrongful death,

to blazing a trail from an adjacent stream to the nearest comer, and
to cutting some poles and laying them in the semblance of a cabin
foundation. After the filing of the selection, he visited the land
once or twice a year, for several years thereafter, while on hunting
trips, and renewed his notices; and thereafter sold his claim. From
the time he first went on the land, and continuously to the time
he sold, he was residing with his wife and children at a place a few
miles distant maintaining a home there. His intention throughout

Dpinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This was a suit in a state court in Whatcom County,
Washington, against the Great Northern Railway Company to have it declared a trustee for the plaintiff of the
title to a quarter-quarter section of land, theretofore
patented to it by the United States, and to compel a
conveyance in discharge of the trust. The company in
its answer denied much that was alleged in the complaint
and sought a decree quieting the title. On the trial the
plaintiff prevailed, and the Supreme Court of the State
affirmed the decree. 126 Wash. 312.
The suit involved a conflict between a railroad lieu
selection and an asserted homestead settlement. The
evidence on the material issues was so direct and free
from contradiction that the real controversy was over
the application of federal statutes to facts conceded or
definitely established.
The Great Northern Railway Company is the successor
in interest of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba
Railway Company, which constructed and put in operation certain lines of railroad in the State of Minnesota
and the Territory of Dakota and thereby became entitled under an early land grant by Congress to particular
lands along those lines. The land officers of the United
States denied the company's right to the lands along the*
lines in Dakota, and treated those lands as open to settlement, entry fnd disposal under the public land laws. In
1890 this Court pronounced the action of the land officers
erroneous and sustained the right of the railway company to the Dakota lands. St. Paul, Minneapolis and

land officers. To correct the resulting wrong to both the
company and the individual claimants, Congress by the
Act of August 8, 1892, c. 382, 27 Stat. 390, requested
the company to relinquish its right to such lands, to the
end that the United States might invest the individual
claimants with a good title, and declared that the company on executing the relinquishment should be entitled
to select and receive other lands in equal quantity. The
company complied with that request and thus became
entitled as matter of legal right, and not of grace, to
select and receive other lands conformably to the terms
of the Act. Shortly described, th Act provided that the
selections might be made within any of the States "into
or through which the railway owned by the said railway
company runs "-Washington being one-from the nonmineral, unreserved public lands therein "to which no
adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been
initiated at the time of the making of such selection ";
that not exceeding 640 acres should be selected in a single
body; that the mode of selection should be by filing
descriptive lists in the land offices for the districts where
the selected tracts lay and paying the usual fees of the
local land officers; that selection might be made of tracts
while yet unsurveyed, in which event they should be
described in a list with a reasonable degree of certainty '
and should be designated according to the survey in a
supplemental list within three months after the plat of
the survey was filed in the local office; and that on the
approval of any list by the Secretary of the Interior 2
the tracts selected therein should be patented to the
company.

Opinion of the Court.

The railway company selected the quarter-quarter in
question May 5, 1902, while it was unsurveyed, by filing
a suitable list in the proper local land office and paying
the officers' fees; and it duly supplemented that list by
another, designating'the tract according to the survey,
within a few days after the plat of the survey was filed
in the local office, which was on February 6, 1907. The
lists were transmitted by the local officers to the General
Land Office and laid before the Secretary of the Interior.
He approved them, and on April 13, 1908, a patent was
issued to the company.
The tract was open to selection and was duly selected
and rightly patented, if at the time of the selectionMay 5, 1902-a homestead claim to the land had not
been initiated by the acts about to be stated. The
plaintiff contended that such a claim had been initiated,
and the courts below so held.
In September or October, 1901, W. J. Tincker, who
possessed the qualifications named in the homestead law,
went to the quarter section which includes this quarterquarter, blazed a line around the larger tract, and posted
notices at its four corners declaring that he claimed it
as a homestead. He was there on that occasion two or
three hours. In March, 8 1902, he went to the quarter
section again, blazed a trail from an adjacent stream to
the nearest corner, cut a few poles and with these laid
what appeared to be a cabin foundation two or three
poles high. The trail did not touch the quarter-quarter
here in question, nor was the pole foundation placed on
it. Tincker was there on that occasion for a longer time
than before, probably the greater part of a working day.
That is all that was done by him prior to the company's
selection. Thereafter he went to the quarter section once

or twice a year, usually on hunting trips, but did nothing
there beyond renewing his notices at the corners. in
August, 1906, he sold his so-called possessory claim and
improvements. When he first went to the land, and continuously to the time he sold, he wasresiding, with his wife
and children, at Maple Falls, a few miles from the land,
and was maintaining a home there. At the trial he was
a witness for the plaintiff and testified that his intention
throughout that period was "to hold" the quarter
section, "expecting some day to go up there and live
on it."

Tincker sold to W. M. Smithey, who three months later
sold to the plaintiff. The last was the only one of the
three who made any attempt at establishing a residence
on the quarter section. In November, 1906, he did
establish a residence on a part of it not here in question;
and after the survey he sought and secured a homestead
entry on that part at the local land office. He also sought
to have the part here in question included in that entry,
but failed. 41 L. D. 375. He had no right to have it
included unless Tincker's acts prior to the company's
selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead claim
and thereby excepted the tract from the class of lands
open to selection.
In the company's selection list and supporting affidavit
nothing was said about Tincker's acts, not improbably
because the selecting agent knew nothing about them
and found nothing on or in the vicinity of the quarterquarter indicative of a homestead settlement or occupancy. When the plaintiff, in 1907, applied to make his
homestead entry and to include this quarter-quarter therein he based his application on his own settlement in
November, 1906, and said nothing about a prior claim
by Tincker. That was the situation when the patent
issued to the company. Afterwards the plaintiff requested
that a suit be brought by the United States to cancel the

Opinion of the Court.

patent on the grounds that the company in making its
selection had not disclosed Tincker's acts and that the
land officers issued the patent without knowledge of those
acts; but the Secretary of the Interior declined to recommend such a suit. The plaintiff brought the present suit
in his own right in 1919--eleven years after the issue of
the patent, during all of which the company had been
regularly paying state and county taxes on the tract.
The homestead law-putting aside special provisions
without bearing here-accords to every person of stated
qualifications the privilege of acquiring title to a quarter
section, or less, of "unappropriated public lands" by
settling thereon and continuously residing on, improving
and cultivating the same for a prescribed period. The
original law was confined to surveyed lands and required
that the claims be initiated by an entry made at the local
land office, which was to be followed within a reasonable
time by actual settlement, residence, etc. Act May 20,
1862, c. 75, ยงยง 1, 2, 12 Stat. 392; Rev. Stat. ยงยง 2289,
2290; Act March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1098. After-.
wards a provision was added permitting claims to be
initiated, as respects either surveyed or unsurveyed lands,
by settlement and providing, where that was done, that
record entry should be sought within three months after
settlement if the land was surveyed, or, if unsurveyed,
within a like period after the survey was made and the
plat was filed in the local office. Act of May 14, 1880,
c. 89, ยง 3, 21 Stat. 140. The term "settlement" is used
as comprehending acts done on the land by way of
establishing or preparing to establish an actual personal
residence-going thereon and, with reasonable diligence,
arranging to occupy it as a home to the exclusion of one
elsewhere. The law makes it plain that there must be.
a definite purpose "in good faith to obtain a homes" by
proceeding "faithfully- and honestly" to comply with
"all the requirements." And the decisions made and in100569 -26-35

270 U. S.

structions issued by the officers charged with its administration show that they uniformly have taken the position that a claim cannot be initiated by asserted acts of
settlement which are only colorable and done with a purpose to hold the land for speculation or while maintaining
an actual residence elsewhere.' The instructions say:
"Settlement is initiated through the personal act of a
settler placing improvements on the- land or establishing
a residence thereon. . . . When settlement is made
on unsurveyed lands the settler must plainly mark the
boundaries of all land claimed. Within a reasonable time
after settlement actual residence must be established on
the land and continuously maintained."
The decisions of this Court have established the principle that one who, in response to the invitation in the
homestead law, actually settles on the public lands in an
honest effort to acquire a home should be dealt with
leniently and not subjected to the loss of his toil and
efforts through any mistake or neglect of the officers or
agents of the Government. Ard v. Brandon, 156 U. S.

219 U. S.426; Svor v. Morris, 227 U. S.524, 527; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Houston, 231 U. S. 181.
The Supreme Court of the State rightly recognized that
the plaintiff's claim was initiated long after the company's
selection at the local land office, and therefore that the real
question was whether Tincker's asserted acts prior to that
selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead
claim. If they did, the tract in dispute was not subject
to selection under the Act of 1892; otherwise it was. The
important words of the Act are, public lands " to which
no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been
initiated at the time of the making of such selection."
The Supreme Court of the State held that Tincker's acts
"were not sufficient to initiate a bona fide settlement,"
but concluded with some hesitation that they nevertheless
took the tract out of the class of lands subject to selection.
We agree that Tincker did not make a bona fide settlement, and we are further of opinion that his acts fell so
far short of such a settlement that they did not amount to
the initiation of a claim in any admissible view of the
homestead law or the Act of 1892. He did nothing indicative of a present purpose to establish a home on the
quarter section. He started no real improvements, made
no preparations for living there, did not attempt to reside
there and did not take his family there but confined himself to minor acts calculated merely to deter others from

initiating claims. In the seven or eight months preceding
the company's selection, he was on the land but twiceless than a day each time. His subsequent conduct, if
we turn to it, is equally persuasive that he was without a
present purpose to make the place a home. He merely
visited it once or twice a year, usually on hunting trips,
and on those visits only renewed the notices intended to
deter others. Considering what he did and his t~stimony
that he was expecting from his first trip in 1901 to his
sale in 1906 that "some day" he would go there to live,
we think it apparent that his asserted settlement, even
if not a myth in his own mind, fell pronouncedly short of
satisfying the requirements of the homestead law in respect of the initiation of a claim, and so did not except the
quarter-quarter in question from the company's right of
selection under the Act of 1892. Ie endeavored in his
testimony to attribute his omissions to a temporary withdrawal of the land and the surrounding area pending an
inquiry as to whether they should be included in an existing forest reserve. But that withdrawal-it later was
revoked-could not have been a factor in the matter,
because the withdrawal order when produced in evidence
disclosed that it was made more than a year after his
asserted settlement and more than six months after the
company's selection, and that it contained a provision
declaring that bona fide settlements and valid claims were
not affected by it.
If, while maintaining a home at Maple Falls, Tincker
could initiate a homestead claim by acts such as are disclosed here, and thus hold the land against others desiring to initiate claims, the way was open for him similarly
to make a colorable appropriation of many tracts in that
timber region and thus to exact tribute from intending
settlers and claimants. His acts, if effective against the
company's right of selection, would be equally an obstacle to the initiation of homestead settlement claims,

GREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. REED.

Opinion of the Court.

which is admissible only in respect of unappropriated
public lands.
The state court regarded its conclusion as deriving some
support from cases in this Court; but we think the cases
cited are not susceptible of that interpretation. All are
cases where the individual claim which operated to defeat the railroad claim or selection was prior in time and
had been initiated either by an entry at the land office
or by an actual bona fide settlement. KansasPacific Railway Co. v. Dunmeyer, 113 U. S. 629, and St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba,Ry. Co. v. Donohue, 210 U. S. 21,
are typical of all. In both a homestead claim prior in
time was involved. In the first it had been initiated by an
entry at the land office, and in the second by actual settlement and occupancy in good faith. In both it was in
existence when the right of the railroad company became
fixed, if fixed at all; and the ruling was that such a claim
existing at that time excepted the land-from the company's grant in one case and from its right of lieu selection in the other-and that a subsequent abandonment,
relinquishment or failure to comply with the law on the
part of the homestead claimant neither obviated the exception nor entitled the company to the land-under the
grant in one case and the selection in the other. We perceive nothing in either case which makes for the view
that adts which fall far short of initiating a claim, in either
mode, work such an exception.
The selection in t. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba
Ry. Co.v. Donohue was under the Act of 1892, now before us, and was of unsurveyed land. When it was made
a qualified claimant, who had settled theretofore and
given notice of the extent of his claim, was residing on,
occupying and improving the land and in good faith conforming to the homestead requirements.

Subsequently

he died, and his mother as sole heir sold his possessory
claim and improvements to Donohue, who made a timber

and stone entry of the land after the survey. This Court,
after carefully pointing out that the homestead claim was
lawfully initiated, held that the land was excepted from
the right of selection and therefore that the selection was
of no avail. Most of the discussion in the opinion was to
no purpose if, as is contenled here, it was immaterial
whether the homestead claim was initiated in substantial
conformity to the homestead requirements.
A selection of unsurveyed land under the same Act was
involved in Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Hower, 236 U. S.
702, and was sustained against an asserted prior homestead claim on the ground that, while the claimant had
put a small barn on the tract and had cut a trail across
it prior to the selection, he had never resided thereon or
shown any purpose to do so, but had been maintaining
a home on other land not even contiguous to it.
The Donohue Case and the Hower Case taken together
illustrate the principle of prior cases and show how it
should be applied here.
