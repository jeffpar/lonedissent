dissenting.

We cannot think Congress intended that the Act of
March 4, 1917, without more should deprive the States of
power to protect themselves against threatened disaster
like the one disclosed by this record.
If the Secretary of Agriculture had taken some affirmative action the problem would be a very different one.
Congress could have exerted all the power which .this
statute delegated to him by positive and direct enactment.
If it had said nothing whatever, certainly the State could
have resorted to the quarantine; and this same right, we
think, should be recognized when its agent has done
nothing.
It is a serious thing to paralyze the efforts of a State
to protect her people against impending calamity and
leave them to the slow charity of a far-off and perhaps
supine federal bureau. No such purpose should be attributed to Congress unless indicated beyond reasonable
doubt.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the"
Court.
The Southern Pacific Company filed a petition in the
Court of Claims seeking to recover compensation for the
transportation of impedimenta carried with troop trains
of the United States. It asked for a judgment of $42,734.97. After a hearing on the evidence, the Court of
Claims gave judgment for the Company in the sum of
$498.38. This judgment was entered May 11, 1925. On
July 10, 1925, the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial,
which, on October 26, 1925, the court denied. On October
28, 1925, the Company filed a petition for an appeal,
which was allowed by the Court of Claims on November
2, 1925.
A motion is now made by the United States to dismiss
the appeal on the ground that this Court was deprived
of jurisdiction to entertain appeals from the Court of

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

Claims by the Act entitled "An Act to amend the Judicial
Code and to further define the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Courts of Appeals-and of the Supreme Court and for other
purposes," approved February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat.
936. Section 14 of that. Act provides: "This Act shall
take effect three months after its approval, but it shall
not affect cases then pending in the Supreme Court, nor
shall it affect the right to a review or the mode or time for
exercising the same as respects any judgment or decree
entered prior to the date when it takes effect." The Act
took effect May 13, 1925. The judgment from which an
appeal is sought was entered May 11, 1925, but the effect
of that judgment as a final judgment was suspended by
the motion for a new trial duly filed, within thd rules of
the Court, on July 10, 1925. This motion was not finally
denied until October 26, 1925, and not until then did the
judgment become subject to review in this Court. The
general principle is well established by many decisions of
this Court, some of which are cited in Morse V. United
Statef, post, p. 151. That the operation of the Act of February" 13, 1925, does not change the application of the
principle appears clearly from the case of Andrews v.
Virginian Railway, 248 U. S. 272. In that case, a suit for
damages for wrongful death was heard in a state Circuit
Court of Virginia, and a judgment rendered in favor of
the defendant, June 16, 1916. A petition for writ of error
to review the judgment was presented to the Court of
Appeals and finally denied on November 13, 1916. On'
November 27, 1916, a petition was presented to the Presiding Judge of the state Circuit Court for the allowance
of a writ of error from this Court to review the judgment
of that court of June 16, 1916, which was allowed, and the
case was brought here. Between the time of the rendition
of the judgment in the state Circuit Court and the denial
of the petition for writ of error by the Court of Appeals
of Virginia, November 13, 1916, the Act of Congress of

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

September 6, 1916, ch. 448, 39 Stat. 726, had been approved and became operative October 6, 1916. Il form
the judgment to which the writ of error was addressed
was rendered on June 16, 1916, before the operation of
the Act of Congress, and it was argued that the judgment
was outside its provisions. The question considered by
the court was thus whether the judgment was a final
judgment at the date named, or became so only by the
state Court of Appeals declining in the exercise of. its discretion to take jurisdiction on November 13, 1916, after
the passage of the new Act of Congress. It was held that,
though the action of the Court of Appeals was the mere
exercise of gracious or discretionary power, neither imperative nor obligatory, the judgment 6f the (ircuit Court
could not be regarded as final for the purpose of review
in this Court until after the exercise by the Court of Ap
peals of this discretion. It was therefore held that the
judgment of the state Circuit Court, though rendered before the approval of the Act of September 6, 1916, which
took effect October 6, 1916, must be regarded as not final
'with reference to the review by this Court until the refusal
of the Court of Appeals of Virginia to consider the case on
November 13, 1916. And so in this case. While the judgment to which the appeal was allowed was actually entered two days before the Act of Congress of February
13, 1925, went into effect, the subsequent motion for a
new trial of July 10, 1925, seasonably filed, suspended the
judgment of the Court of Claims as a final judgment for
purposes of review until the denial of the motion for new
trial in October, 1925. This Court, therefore, has no
jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a judgment acquiring finality only in October after the going into effect
of the Act of February 13, 1925, which limited the method
of review by this Court of final judgments in the Court of
Claims to writs of certiorari after May 13, 1925. The
motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted. In the

meantime, and in due time, a petition for certiorari was
filed, which the Court has considered, and does now grant,
and the cause is set for hearing on the summary docket

APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.

Nos. 328, 329. Argued November 25, 1925.-Decided March 1, 1926.
1. Upon an appeal to this Court from a decree of the District Court
dismissing a petition for want of ancillary jurisdiction, the equity
of the petition, antl questions whether it should be denied because
of acquiescence or laches, are not open. P. 115.
2. As ancillary to a decree of railway foreclosure, by which the purchaser of the property was allowed a fixed time in which to elect
not to assume outstanding leases and contracts, and which reserved
for future adjudication all questions not disposed of, and permitted
all parties, including the purchaser, to apply to the court for
further relief at the foot of the decree, tlbe District Court had
jurisdiction, irrespective of citizenship, over a petition of the purchaser seeking to be relieved of agreements made by its predecessors with a terminal company, upon the ground that the purchaser's failure to relieve itself of them by a valid election was
due to a mistake. P. 115.
3. A delay of two years in filing such petition is not a reason for
dismissing it for want of jurisdiction. P. 114.
