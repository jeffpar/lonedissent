WHITE v. UNITED STATES ET

AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 177. Argued January 26, 1926.-Decided March 1, 1926.
1. The Act of March 5, 1925, giving appellate jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts of Appeals in suits for war risk insurance, including
suits pending, did not apply to a case pending in this Court on
appeal on the date of the Act. P. 179.
2. A form of certificate of war risk insurance providing that it should
be subject not only to the War Risk Insurance Act but to .any
future amendments .thereof, could be validly adopted under the
Act by the Director with the approval of the Secretary of the
Treasury. P. 180.
3. Where a certificate was thus subject to future legislation, the beneficiary named had not such a vested right in the instalments payable as will prevent letting in another beneficiary not eligible under
the statute originally, but named in the soldier's will and made eligible by an amendment of the statute passed after his death. P. 180.

APPEAL from a judgmefit of the District Court in a suit
to enforce rights claimed under a certificate of war risk
insurance.

Mr. A. T. Gordon, with whom Mr. R. L. Gordon, Jr.,
was on the brief, for appellant.
The judgment of the court below, founded upon the
amended Act, violates the Fifth Amendment by taking
the property of the appellant without compensation.

Reeves as one of the beneficiaries of the contract is not
voidable, but void. The Act of Congress expressly forbade the insured to name her as a participant in the fund.
The power of Congress to extend the permitted class of
beneficiaries ceases when the title of the permitted beneficiary becomes complete.
The policy is not a gratuity, but a contract, founded
upon a valuable consideration, to wit, seven dollars per
month deducted from the soldier's pay. It has been
fully performed by the payment of the sums stipulated
for and by the performance of the services which it was
intended to stimulate. The fact that the insured only
paid the normal premiums incident to times of peace and
the Governiment paid the additional premium incident to
the hazards of war, cannot affect the obligation to'pay
the sum contracted for or justify an interpretation of the
Act which robs the contract of its character as a property
right.
The contract is entire, founded upon an indivisible consideration. The fact that the payments are in future installments is immaterial. The contract insured the life of
the soldier in the sum of ten thousand dollars. This sum
is divided into 240 installments, based on a life expectancy of twenty years. In the event of the soldier's death
within this period, the promise is to pay his beneficiary
the same installments for twenty years or, in the event of
her death, for such proportion of it as she actually continues in life. Hence death is a condition subsequent,
operating to defeat the previously vested interest in the
fund. An estate is "vested" where there is an immedi-ate right of present enjoyment, or a present fixed right'of
future enjoyment. Armstrong v. Barber, 239 Ill. 389;
United States v. Fidelty Trust Co., 222 U. S. 155.
Congress can make no contract with the insured except
by statute. The Act in question did not, and could not
constitutionally, authorize the Department to incorporate

conditions in the contract reserving to Congress the power
to alter or change its terms. Williamson v. United
States, 207 U. S. 425.
The power of Congress to reserve the right to alter or
amend the grant is exclusive.
But, aside from this, had the general language found
in the application of the insured been incorporated in the
Act of 1917, it would not change the result. A general
reservation of this character gives no power to destroy
the obligation of the contract. The reservations have
relation to the executory stages of performance during
the life of the contract, and then only to reasonable
changes that do not materially affect its obligation.

Solicitor General Mitchell, with whom Assistant Attorney General Letts, and Messrs. Alfred A. Wheat and
William M. Offley, Special Assistants to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for appellees.
The jurisdiction of this Court on direct appeal must
be rested on §-238 of the Judicial Code, as it stood in
1924, allowing direct appeals in cases involving the construction of the Constitution of the United States. As
this appeal was taken in August, 1924, the Act of February 13, 1925, does not apply. Although Congress may
withdraw the right of appeal even after the appeal has
been taken, Crane v. Hahlo,- 258 U. S. 142, the Act of
March 4, 1925, is prospective ifi the sense that it was not
intended to affect cases in which appeals had been
taken prior to its passage, especially as the earlier Act of
February 13, 1925, had expressly saved pending appeals,

The jurisdiction of this Court depends therefore on
whether a substantial constitutional question is presented. Goodrich v. Ferris, 214 U. S. 71; Sugarman v.
United States, 249 U. S. 182.
The Act of December 24, 1919, did not deprive the appellant of property without due process of law, and its
retroactive provisions must be sustained because the War
Risk Insurance Act, as amended October 6, 1917, gave to
the Director, under the direction of the Secretary of the
Treasury, power to administer, execute, and enforce the
provisions of the Act and authority to make rules and
regulations for that, purpose and to determine the full
and exact terms and conditions of the contract. The
Director exercised this power by prescribing a condition,
which was inserted in the contract in express terms, that
the contract should be subject in all respects to the provisions of the Act of October 6, 1917, and of any amendments thereto and of all regulations thereunder "now in
force or hereafter adopted." The power given him by
the Act was sufficiently broad to authorize the Director to
reserve in the contract a power to the United States to
enact laws amending the contract subsequent to its issuance, at least for the purposes of carrying out the objects
of the Act, and the wishes of the insured. These provisions should be construed to render the law subject to
modification by Congress after the issuance of the contract
and after the death of the insured so as to meet the expressed wish of the soldier as to which of those dependent
upon him should receive the benefits of the insurance.
The Act of December 24, 1919, is a legislative recognition that the Director was acting within his powers, or is
a ratification of his act in reserving to Congress a right to
alter the contract. The Act of December 24, 1919,
validating an ineffective attempt of the insured to designatehis aunt as a beneficiary, may be sustained on principles applied to sustain curative Acts.

WHITE v. UNITED STATES.

MR.

Opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
George White, a soldier in the American army during
the late war, on July 1, 1918, took out insurance upon his
life for $10,000 under the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, Article IV, § 400; 40 Stat. 398, 409.
He designated his mother, the appellant, as beneficiary,
but by a letter of the same date, since established as his
will, he provided that one-half of the sums paid should
go to his aunt, Lucy Reeves, who at that time was not
among those to whom the statute allowed the policy to be
made payable. § 401. He died on October 4, 1918, and
thereafter monthly installments of $57.50 were paid to
the mother through January, 1921. The award of the
whole to her then was suspended on the ground that by
the will the aunt was entitled to one-half. The Act of
December 24, 1919, c. 16, § 13; 41 Stat. 371, 375, had enlarged the permitted class of beneficiaries to include aunts
among others and had provided that the section should
be deemed to be in effect as of October 6, 1917, and, with
proper safeguards, that awards of insurance should be revised in accordance with the amended act. On October
9, 1923, the mother filed a petition under § 405 f the
Act of 1917 and the Act of May 20, 1918, c. 77; 40 Stat.
555, to establish her claim to the whole, and set up that
to give effect to the Act of 1919 would be to deprive her
of her property without due process of law contrary to
the Constitution of the United States. The District
Court decided in favor of the aunt. 299 Fed. 855. Mrs.
White appealed to this Court in August, 1924, and it
fairly may be assumed that the Act of March 4, 1925, c,
553; 43 Stat. 1302, 1303, giving the appellate jurisdiction
to the Circuit Court of Appeals does not apply.
Mrs. White's argument, of course, is that, although the
statute allowed a beneficiary to be named by will, it did

not extend the benefit to aunts, so that her son's will was
ineffective at the time when it was established; that
therefore the mother's interest vested as absolute at the
son's death, and could not be defeated by later legislation. But this argument fails when the precise position
of the parties is understood.
The certificate of insurance provided in terms that it
should be "subject in all respects to the provisions of such
Act [of 1917], of any amendments thereto, and of all
regulations thereunder, now in force or hereafter adopted,
all of which, together with the application for this insurance, and the terms and conditions published under authority of the Act, shall constitute the contract." These
words must be taken to embrace changes in the law no
less than changes in the regulations. The form was established by the Director with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and on the authority of Article 1,
§ 1, and Article IV, § 402, of the Act, which, we have no
doubt, authorized it. The language is very broad and
does not need precise discussion when the nature of the
plan is remembered. The insurance was a contract, to be
sure, for which a premium was paid, but it was not one
entered into by the United States for gain. All soldiers
were given a right to it and the relation of the Government to them if not paternal was at least avuncular. It
was a relation of benevolence established by the Governinent at considerable cost to itself for the soldier's good.
It was a new experiment in which changes might be
found necessary, or at least, as in this case, feasible more
exactly to carry out his will. If the soldier was willing
to put himself into the Government's hands to that extent no one else could complain. The only relations of
contract were betmeen the Government and him. White's
mother's interest at his death was vested only so far as
he and the Government had made it so, and wvas subject
to any conditions upon which they might agree. They

did agree to terms that cut her rights down to one-half.
She is a volunteer and she cannot claim more. See Helmholz v. United States, 294 Fed. 417, affirming 283 Fed.

Judgment affirmed.
UNITED STATES v. MINNESOTA.
No. 17, Original.

Argued January 4, 5, 1926.-Decided March 1, 1926.

1. A suit against a State brought by the United States as guardian
of tribal Indians to recover the title, or money proceeds, of lands
alleged to have been patented to the State by the United States in
breach of its trust obligations to the Indians,-is not a suit in which
the Indians are the real parties in interest, but one in which the
United States is really and directly interested; and is within the
original jurisdiction of this Court. P. 193.
2. The six year limitation (Act of March 3, 1891,) is inapplicable
where the United States sues to annul patents issued in alleged
violation of rights of its Indian wards and of its obligations to
them. P. 195.
3. State statutes of limitations do not apply to such suits. Id.
4. The United States, as guardian of Indians, is without right to
recover from a State lands which, in a suit between the Indians
and the United States in the Court of Claims, were adjudged to
have been rightly patented to the State. P. 199.
5. The courts can not go behind a treaty with Indian tribes for the
purpose of annulling it upon the ground that in its negotiation
the representatives of the Indians were'prevented from exercising
their free judgment. P. 201.
6. The Swamp Land Act of 1850 operated as a grant in praesenti.
P. 202.
7. The Act of March 12, 1860, extending the prqvisions of the Swamp
Land Act of 1850 to Minnesota and Oregon, with a proviso "that
the grant hereby made shall not include any lands which the government of the United States may have reserved, sold, or disposed
of (in pursuance of any law heretofore enacted) prior to the confirmation of title to be made under the authority of the said act,"
granted those States an immediate inchoate title to the public
swamp land in their confines, to become perfect as of the date
