poses the two are separable, and neither affects the character of the business as to the other. Eureka Pipe Line
Ca. v. Hallanan, 257 U. S. 265; United Fuel Gas Co. v.
Hallanan, 257 U. S. 277, 281. And see Hallanan v.
Eureka Pipe Line Co., 261 U. S. 393; Hallananv. United
Fuel Gas Co., 261 U. S. 398. The Supreme Court of the
State has found that more than enough Pennsylvania
gas goes into the mixture to meet the xequirements of the
order, and on this basis has construed the order as leaving
the company free to deal in usual course with so much
of the mixture as represents the gas from West Virginia.
We think the finding has ample support in the evidence,
and we accept of course that court's construction of the
order. In these circumstances the conclusion is unavoidable, we think, that the order does not interfere with or
affect the interstate commerce in which the company is
engaged.
Whether the order, if it did apply to gas in such commerce, could be -sustained becomes immaterial in view
of the conclusion just stated, and therefore need not be

considered.
Judgments affirmed.

from a decree of the District Court restraining
the appellant, Auditor of the State of Oklahoma, from
attempting to collect state inheritance taxes by recourse
to appellees' lands.
APPEAL

Mr. J. Berry King, Assistant Attorney General of
Oklahoma, with whom Messrs. George F. Short, Attorney General, Leon S. Hirsh, Assistant Attorney General,
and C. H. Nicholas were on the brief, for appellant.
Members of the Quapaw Tribe, residing in Oklahoma,
are citizens of the State, and, as such, their right to
transfer and receive property after death has its inception in, and is regulated by, the laws of Oklahoma governing decedents' estates. By the Act of April 28, 1904,
c. 1824, 33 Stat. 573, the laws of descent of Arkansas
were specifically "extended in their operation, -so as to
embrace all persons and estates" in Indian Territory.
By the Enabling Act, the Arkansas law was superseded,
and the courts of Oklahoma succeeded to the jurisdiction:
over Indian estates. Jefferson v. Fink, 247 U. S. 288; In
r Pigeon's Estate, 81 Okla. 180; Teague v. Smith, 85
Okla. 12; Harrison v. Harrison, 87 Okla. 91; Graves v.
Jacobs, 92 Okla. 62.
The Federal Government is without authority to control the devolution of estates in Oklahoma. United States
v. Harris,106 U. S. 629; McCulloch v. Maryland,4 Wheat.
316; Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333; United
States v. Ohio Oil Co., 234 U. S1 548; Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S-. 241; Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36.
Section 1 of the Oklahoma Enabling Act, specifying that
the Government should have plenary authority over the
Indians, did not operate to confer upon the Federal Government the power to exempt from state charges the property of Indians in this State. Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221
U. S. 559; McNulty v. Beatty, 10 How. 71; Hawkins v.
Bleakley, 243 U. S. 210; Kansas v. Colorado,206 U. S. 95.
Though Congress has some authority over the Indians,

such power may not be extended by act of Congress in
the forin of an enabling act, nor may the delegated power
of Congress be increased by consent of a State. In
United States v. Fox, 94 U. S. 315, it was said that "the
title and modes of disposition of real property, within a
State, whether inter vivos or testamentary, are not matters placed under the control of federal authority." The
admission of Oklahoma as a State terminated all federal
laws of descent and distribution theretofore in force in
Indian Territory, irrespective of the provisions of the
Enabling Act. The State is sovereign in all those particulars wherein it has not joined in the general delegation to the Federal Government. See McCormick v.
Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 192; Segley v. Car Co., 120 U. S.
580; United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. .625; Snyder v.
Bettman, 190 V. S. 249; Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498;
Langdon v. Sherwood, 124 U. S. 74; O'Callighan v.
O'Brien, 199 U. S. 99; Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485;
Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 43; Plummer v. Coler, 178
U. S. 115; Sunderland v. United States, 266 U. S. 226.
That the property is exempt from' taxation does not
prevent the operation of the succession tax law upon
the devolution of the estate. Plummer v. Coler, 178
U. S. 115; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157
U. S. 537; Wallace v. Myers, 38 Fed. 184; Estate of
Sherman, 153 N. Y. 1; Strode v. Commonwealth, 52 Pa.
181; United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625.
The lands were allotted to the Indians while Congress
had plenary authority over the territory, and Congress
contracted an exemption from taxation on the land
which could not be impaired by the Enabling Act.
Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665. Such restriction, no
doubt, confers upon the Federal Government an interest
in the land during the lifetime of the allottee, but not
thereafter, because the Federal Government has no more
right to entail lands in a State than any individual.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The necessary conflict between the right of the States
to collect revenue for state purposes and the right of the
Federal Government to exempt for its purposes requires
that the right to exemption be recognized only on those
cases where the subject matter is a proper, vital, and
necessary governmental function, such as the holding of
lands for postoffices, forts, arsenals, and the like. But
the power residing in the Federal Government to assume
control over, and withdraw from taxation, the rights or
property of citizens of a State, when exercised or located
within the State, must necessarily be limited. See South
Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437. The conflict
between the right of the Federal Government to tax and
the right of the State to exempt, likewise exists between
the right of the State to tax and the right of the Government to exempt. Madison, Annals of Congress,. Vol.
1, p. 455; Hamilton, State Control of Local Taxation;
The Federalist, No. 31; Western Union v. Attorney General of Massachusetts,125 U. S. 530.
Mr. Joseph W. Howell for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
See-Sah Quapaw, a full-blood Quapaw Indian woman,
died March 4, 1920. She owned certain duly allotted
lands in Oklahoma, patented by the Secretary of the Interior September 26, 1896, and declared to be "inalienable for a period of twenty-five years" thereafter-all as
provided by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 188, ยง 1, 28 Stat.
876, 907. Following the state statute of descent, the
Secretary declared that the only heirs were her husband,
and brother-John Beaver and Benjamin Quapaw-fullblood Quapaws. Act June 25, 1910, c. 431, ยง 1, 36 Stat.

for another twenty-five years by the Act of March 3,
1921, c. 119, ยง 26, 41 Stat. 1225, 1248.
Apparently appellant supposed that the lands passed
to the heirs by virtue of the laws of the State and were
subject to the inheritance taxes which she laid. He accordingly demanded their payment of appellees and
threatened enforcement by summary process and sale of
the lands. The court below held that the State had no
right to demand the taxes and restrained apellant from
attempting to collect them.
The duty of the Secretary of the Interior to determine
the heirs according to the State law of descent, is not
questioned. Congress provided that the lands should
descend and directed how the heirs should be ascertained. It adopted the provisions of the Oklahoma statute as an expression of its own will-the laws of Missouri or Kansas, or any other State, might 'have been
accepted. The lands really passed under a law of the
United States, and not by Oklahoma's permission.
It must be accepted as established that during the
trust or restrictive period Congress has power to control
lands Wvithin a State which have been duly allotted to
Indians by the United States and thereafter conveyed
through trust or restrictive patents. This is essential to
the proper discharge of their duty to a dependent people;
and the means or instrumentalities utilized therein cannot be subjected to taxation by the State without assent
of the federal government. The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall.
