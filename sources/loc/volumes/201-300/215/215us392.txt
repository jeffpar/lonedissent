Statement of the Case.

215 U. S.

KOMADA & CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 220.

Argued November 29, 30, 1909.-Decided January 3, 1910.

The construction given by the Department charged with executing
a tariff act is entitled to great weight; and where for a number
of years a manufactured article has been classified under the similitude section this court will lean in the same direction; and so held
that the Japanese beverage, sake, is properly dutiable under ยง 297
of the tariff act of July 24, 1897, c. 11, 30 Stat. 151, 205, as similar
to still wine and not as similar to beer.
After a departmental classification of an article under the similitude
section of a tariff law, the reinactment, by Congress, of a tariff law
without specially classifying that article may be regarded as a qualified approval by Congress of such classification.

THIS case is before us on a writ of certiorari to the United

States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The
question is the proper classification, under the tariff act of
July 24, 1897, 30 Stat. 151, c.11, of a Japanese beverage
known as "sake." "Sake" is not named in that act, but ยง 7
(p. 205), frequently spoken of as "the similitude section,"
reads as follows:
"That each and every imported article, not enumerated
in this act, which is similar, either in material, quality, texture,
or the use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated in this act as chargeable with duty, shall pay the same
rate of duty which is levied on the enumerated article which
it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned;
and if any non-enumerated article equally resembles two or
more enumerated articles on which different rates of duty are
chargeable, there shall be levied on such non-enumerated

article the same rate of duty as is chargeable on the article
which it resembles paying the highest rate of duty."
In November, 1904, petitioner imported some sake at the
port of San Francisco, and, following prior rulings, the collector, under the similitude section, held it similar to still
wine containing more than fourteen per cent of absolute
alcohol, and dutiable accordingly at fifty cents per gallon,
under paragraph 296 (p. 174). The petitioner protested and
claimed that it was either a non-enumerated manufactured
article, dutiable at twenty per cent ad valorem, under ยง 6
(p. 205), or, by reason of similitude to ale, porter or beer, at
twenty cents per gallon under paragraph 297 (p. 174). Both
the 'board of general appraisers and the Circuit Court sustained the protest, feeling themselves constrained by the
decision of the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New
York (Nishimiya v. United States, 131 Fed. Rep. 650) and
that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
(United States v. Nishimiya, 137 Fed. Rep. 396; S. C., 69 C.
C. A. 588). On appeal, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the Circuit
Court and sustained the classification made by the collector.
Mr. Thomas Fitch and Mr. W. Wickham Smith, with whom
Mr. John M. Thurston was on the brief, for petitioner:
Under the similitude section of the tariff act the similitude
must be substantial. Arthur v. Fox, 108 U. S. 125; Murphy v.
Anderson, 96 U. S.131.
In cases of doubtful classification of articles the construction is to be in favor of the importer. Powers v. Barney, 5

similitude is equal, yet, in determining whether there is or
is not an equality, the doubt will be resolved in favor of the
importer. Tiffany v. United States, 112 Fed. Rep. 672; Re
Guggenheim Smelting Co., 112 Fed. Rep. 517; United States v.
Dana, 99 Fed. Rep. 433; Re Herter Bros., 53 Fed. Rep. 913;

States v. Wotton, 53 Fed. Rep. 344; United States v. Schoverling, 146 U. S. 76; Von Bernuth v. United States, 146 Fed.
Rep. 61; Hahn v. United States, 100 Fed. Rep. 635.
Methods of manufacture are to be considered in determining similitude. Weilbacher v. Merritt, 37 Fed. Rep. 85; Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 Fed. Cas. 1168; aff'd 101 U. S. 278.
There is no force in the suggestion that the decision in the
Woozens Case, G. A. 2786, establishes any rule of construction.
That rule can only be invoked after long continued practice
in the same case. Merritt v. Cameron, 137 U. S. 542; United
States v. Johnson, 173 U. S. 363, 377; Cross v. Burke, 146
U. S. 82, 87.
The doctrine of commercial designation does not apply,
and if it did the weight of evidence is against the Government.
That sake is not a spirituous beverage is shown by numerous decisions, six of state, two of Federal, courts besides
one of this court. The testimony of five importers and two
Government appraisers shows that sake is not a wine by
commercial designation. Statistics of Japanese immigration
show that the commercial world has never acquiesced in its
classification as a wine. The rulings of the internal revenue
department show that there it has for years been classed and
taxed as a beer. The customs laws show that the quantity
of alcohol in a beverage is not the test by which it is classified. The evidence conclusively shows that in material from
which made, in process of manufacture, in chemical composition, in stability, in taste and in manner of use there are
wide dissimilitudes between sake and still wine.
The sole similitude between wine and sake is in alco-

holic strength. The General Board of Appraisers, the United
States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York,
the United States Circuit Court for the Second Circuit and
the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District
of California all decided that the one similitude in alcoholic
strength was not sufficient as against the many dissimilitudes
to establish a substantial similitude between sake and wine.
The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Ciretfit decided that the one similitude of alcoholic strength
overcomes all dissimilitudes.
Mr. J. C. McReynolds, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom The Attorney General was on the brief,
for the United States:
The action of the collector is presumptively correct and the
burden is on the importers to establish their contention; the
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be approved,
therefore, even though this court should think the weight of
evidence against that conclusion. Arthur v. Unkart, 96 U. S.
118; Earnshaw v. Cadwalader, 145 U. S. 247, 262; Erhardt v.
Schroeder, 155 U. S. 124; United States v. Ranlett, 172 U. S.

whatever has been imposed on the importer. United States

Sake is similar to still wines as measured by use, quality and
material, and although there may be some similarity to beer
there is a greater similarity to still wine.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

Something can be said on both sides of the question of
similarity, and if the case turned simply upon that question
it might be difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion. In
such a case the construction given by the Department charged
with the execution of the tariff acts is entitled to great
weight. As said by Mr. Justice McKenna, delivering the recent opinion of the court in United States v. Hermanos, 209
U. S.337, 339:
"We have said that when the meaning of a statute is doubtful great weight should be given to the construction placed
upon it by the department charged with its execution. Robertson v. Downing, 127 U. S. 607; United States v. Healey, 160
U. S. 136. And we have decided that the reenactment by
Congress, without change, of a statute which had previously
received long continued executive construction is an adoption
by Congress of such construction. United States v. Falk, 204
U. S. 143, 152."
In the decision of this case Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Peckham concurred solely because of the prior administrative construction.
Prior to 1894 sake was classified by similitude to distilled
liquor and subjected to a duty of $2.50 per proof gallon under
paragraph 329, act 1890, 26 Stat. 567, 589, c.1244, and $2
under Schedule A, act 1883, 22 Stat. 488, 494, c. 121.

KOMADA v. UNITED STATES.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In July, 1894, Y. Woozeno protested against this classification, claiming the liquor was dutiable under the act of 1890
by similitude to still wine. He was sustained by the Board
of General Appraisers in opinion dated October 4, 1894 (T. D.
15392, G. A. 2786). The Treasury Department acquiesced,
and has acted accordingly until the present time; no protest
against the practice was entered until March, 1902. Three
years after the ruling in the Woozeno case, Congress passed
the tariff act of 1897, which in no way modified the provisions
upon which the appraisers had previously based their decision. This in effect confirmed their action. In March, 1902,
Hackfeld & Co., Honolulu, protested against the classification
of "sake" by similitude to still wine, but the prior ruling
was sustained by the appraisers and the importer acquiesced
in the decision. In the tariff act of 1909 sake is specially
enumerated with still wine, (paragraph 307):
"Still wines, including ginger wine or ginger cordial, vermuth, and rice wine or sake, and similar beverages not
specially provided for in this section, . . . if containing
more than fourteen per centum of absolute alcohol, sixty
cents per gallon." 36 Stat. 11, 40, c. 6.
In April, 1903, Nishimiya imported some sake at New
York, and protested against the classification by similitude
to still wine. The board of appraisers sustained the collector,
but on appeal to the Circuit Court for the Southern District
of New York the Circuit Judge thought that sake was not
sufficiently like either wine or beer to be classified by similitude, and held it to be a non-enumerated manufactured article. This conclusion was sustained, by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit. United States v. Nishimiya,
supra.
Thus it appears that prior to 1894 sake was classified by
similitude to distilled liquor, and then on a protest by an
importer it was classified by similitude to still wine, and that
ruling has been followed from that time to the present,
receiving in the meantime at least a qualified approval by

Congress. It was accepted without challenge until 1902.
Then, a protest against it having been overruled, it remained
unchallenged for another year. After this, and in the latest
tariff act, Congress has in terms put sake in the category
with still wines.
Under these circumstances we think the intent of Congress
in respect to the classification of sake is clearly manifested,
and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

ELIAS v. RAMIREZ.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME

COURT

OF THE TERRITORY

OF

ARIZONA.

No. 30.

Submitted November 5, 1909.-Decided January 3, 1910.

In this case this court, reviewing the evidence, reverses the territorial
court and finds that there is evidence to show, with sufficient certainty, that an extraditable crime was committed by the person
benefited thereby, and thus to satisfy the extradition procedure
statute and justify the order of the commissioner committing the accused to await the action of the Executive Department on a requisition made for forgery under the extradition treaty with Mexico.
Although the statements of certain witnesses were unsworn to and
therefore might not, under the state law, be admissible before a
committing magistrate, under the extradition statute they are receivable by the commissioner to create a probability of the commission of the crime by the accused.
