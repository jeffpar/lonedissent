HANOVER NATIONAL BANK OF NEW YORK, APPELLANT, v. SUDDATH, AS RECEIVER OF AMERICAN
NATIONAL BANK OF ABILENE (NO. 2).
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 13.

Argued April 20, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Where a bank, after refusing to discount paper sent to it by the insolvent for that purpose, has retained the paper, it cannot, as against
general creditors, set off against that paper, or its proceeds, the bankrupt's overdraft although made after such refusal and pending the
retention of the paper.
153 Fed. Rep. 1022, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Percy S. Dudley for appellant:
The Hanover Bank was entitled in equity to set off the advance made against the notes which it held. Scott v. Arm-

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Edward B. Whitney, with whom Mr. Francis F. Oldham was on .the brief, for appellee:
There is no question of set-off, legal or equitable, in the case,
nor is there any equity in the bill. The receiver's case was
really one in replevin. N. Y. Code of Civ. Pro., §§ 1718, 1726,
1730, and see also § 501; 2 Abbot's Form of Pleading, 869;

and cases cited; Dinan v. Coneys, 143 N. Y. 544.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an outgrowth of a litigation between the same parties, which We have just decided in case No. 12, and we shall
therefore refer to the banks as we did in No. 12, the one as
the Abilene Bank and the other as the Hanover Bank. On
October 11, 1906, in reversing the judgment entered in that
action on the first trial in favor of the Hanover Bank, the,
Circuit Court of Appeals observed (149 Fed. Rep. 127, 130):
"The contention for the defendant in error that it was entitled to set off or counterclaim the indebtedness owing to it
by the Abilene Bank when the latter became insolvent, is
wholly untenable. Such a defense is not available in an action at law for conversion, and, if the defendant had any right
of equitable set-off, this should have been asserted by a bill
in equity."
On November 20, 1906, as we have seen, at the second trial
of the action at law the court directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of the Abilene Bank. A few days afterwards the
bill in this cause was filed on behalf of the Hanover Bank, the
receiver of the Abilene Bank being the defendant, the suit,
it is intimated, having been commenced because of the statement made by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the passage
from its opinion above quoted. The course of dealing between
the two banks, the execution of the written agreement, the
forwarding of the four notes for discount, the refusal to discount, the overdrawing by the Abilene Bank of its account

with the Hanover Bank, the allowance of the overdraft and
the temporary loan of $3,500, the collection of three of the
notes and retention of a sufficient sum to cancel the indebtedness created by the overdraft and the surrender of the balance
to the receiver, together with the uncollected note, were alleged in the bill substantially as we have stated them in the
opinion in No. 12. The commencement and prosecution of
the action at law was next averred and the various steps in
that litigation were detailed, culminating in an averment of
the rendering upon the second trial of the action at law of a
verdict in favor of the Abilene Bank for $3,725.86. It was
charged that the receiver was threatening to enter judgment
upon the verdict. Averring a right in equity to offset the
indebtedness due to it by the Abilene Bank on January 18,
1905, against the demand of that bank or its receiver for the
four notes or their proceeds, the Hanover Bank prayed that
its set-off might be allowed against the receiver, and that he
be enjoined from further prosecuting the action at law. A
demurrer to the bill was sustained and a dismissal was entered. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (153 Fed. Rep. 1022), and the cause was then brought
here.
The decision just announced in case No. 12 establishes the
want of equity in the bill. The mere possession of the notes
by the Hanover Bank after its refusal to discount them did
not justify that bank in relying upon the notes as collateral
security for the indebtedness which arose from the voluntary
payment of the draft drawn by the Abilene Bank upon the
Hanover Bank, when there were no funds in the latter bank
to meet the draft. The notes forwarded January 9 and 10
were sent to be discounted, and the draft drawn on January 11,
which created the overdraft, was presumably drawn upon
the faith that those notes would be discounted, and that the
draft would be paid out of the proceeds. As matter of fact,
however, the Hanover Bank recouped itself out of the proceeds
of but one of the notes, together with the proceeds of notes

Syllabus.

subsequently forwarded to it. In view of the fact that the
Hanover Bank not only notified the Abilene Bank that the
notes would not be discounted, but also by telegram in effect
demanded that the Abilene Bank should forward funds to
meet its drafts, the assumption cannot be rightfully indulged
that the Hanover Bank allowed the overdraft in the belief
that the silence of the Abilene Bank signified that it expected
the draft to be paid, and that to enable the payment the
Hanover Bank might use the notes sent for discount as it saw
fit. It is not contended that there was an express agreement
between the parties that the draft which created the overdraft
should be paid, and that the funds should be realized in the
mode pursued by the Hanover Bank. Considering the transaction either from the standpoint of the forwarding of the
notes for discount and the making of the draft, or from the
standpoint of the sending of the notes for discount, and the
failure of the Abilene Bank to forward funds or to promptly
make known to the Hanover Bank its wishes in the matter,
we are of the opinion that the circumstances of the transaction were not such as to raise the presumption of agreement
for a set-off available as against the general creditors. Scott v.
Armstrong. 146 U. S. 499.
