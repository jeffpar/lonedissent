HYGIENIC CHEMICAL COMPANY OF NEW YORK v.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

Nos. 9, 121.

Argued November 1, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Although in subsequent cases a party may have proved his facts, the
question when here must be decided on the evidence below in the

particular case.
Although one not a party may have contributed to the expenses of a
former suit by reason of business or indirect interest, if it is not
shown he had any right to participate in the conduct of the case he is
not bound as a privy.
Where the Circuit Court and Circuit Court of Appeals of the same
circuit agree on certain facts this court will not reverse the finding
in a case coming from that circuit notwithstanding the same fact
may not have been found by the courts of another circuit.
154 Fed. Rep. 65, affirmed; 157 Fed. Rep. 436, reversed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

These are two suits in equity brought by the Rumford
Chemical Company for the infringement of a patent for baking
powders; one, No. 9, brought in the Third Circuit, New Jersey,
against the Hygienic Chemical Company, a corporation of that
State; the other, No. 121, brought in the Second Circuit, New
York, against a New York corporation of the same name.
The two cases were tried on substantially the same record and
evidence, with the result that in New Jersey the bill was dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 154 Fed. Rep. 65; 83
C. C. A. 177, but in New York the bill was sustained. 159 Fed.
Rep. 436; 86 C. C. A. 416. Writs of certiorari were granted
by this court.
The defendants rested on the plaintiff's evidence, and the
question in both suits was whether a primafacie case had been
made out. It did not appear that the defendants made or
sold baking powders as such, but the New Jersey Company
did make acid phosphates for baking powders and other pur-

Opinion of the Court.

poses, and the New York Company sold the great part of its
products. The plaintiff contended that this acid phosphate
had the characteristics described in its patent, and was made
and sold for use in baking powders, and that the manufacture
and sale were an infringement of its rights. A previous decision, Rumford Chemical Works v. New York Baking Powder
Co., 134 Fed. Rep. 385; 67 C. C. A. 367, establishing the patent,
was relied upon as a test case by which the defendants were
bound, but, except the final decree, entered after the beginning
of the present suits, the record was not put in. It would seem,
from a late case, that the plaintiff was correct in point of fact,
ProvidentChemical Works v. Hygienic Chemical Co., 170 Fed.
Rep. 523, but the question here must be discussed, of course,
on the evidence before the court below. The question is material as bearing upon the admissibility of the evidence of one
Clotworthy, since dead, given in the suit against the New York
Baking Powder Company, upon which the plaintiff relied.
Clotworthy was the president and general manager of the
Clotworthy Chemical Company and was a manufacturer of
baking powder. He testified to the purchase from the Hygienic Company of New York of a barrel of granular acid
phosphate, shown to be similar to that described in the plaintiff's patent. A bill from the New Jersey Company and a receipt from the New York Company also were produced and
put in. The courts in both circuits rightly regarded this as the
most important, if not the only evidence to make out the infringement alleged. Therefore it was necessary that the plaintiff should prove that the defendants were privy to the New
York Baking Powder Company's case.
To prove privity Heller, the president of the defendant companies, was called and asked as to his testimony on the former
occasion. He admitted that he then had testified that "we
are manufacturers of granulated acid phosphate and are selling
to the trade in the same way as" the former defendants; also
that he had testified that "we have [undertaken to assist in
bearing the burdens of this defence and have contributed to

the defence] financially and otherwise." By the natural interpretation of the word in the connection in which it was used
'we' embraced the New Jersey company, and fairly may be
argued to have meant both. Heller swore that these answers
were true, but with the qualification that he did not think that
the New Jersey corporation contributed financially, and .that
he did not remember whether it did otherwise. All the courts
agree that the privity of the New Jersey corporation was not
made out. Probably all, and at least the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court for the Third Circuit, 148 Fed. Rep.
862, agree that if Clotworthy's testimony is excluded infringement is not proved. We should not revise this finding of both
courts on the facts, and therefore it follows that the New
Jersey decree must be affirmed. The evidence on both sides is
discussed in 148 Fed. Rep. 862.
It appears that the New York company contributed to the
expenses of the former case. But that fact alone is not enough
to warrant a different result. The agreement disclosed in 170
Fed. Rep. 523, was not before the court. We may reject as
extravagant the suggestion that the contribution may have
been made from charitable motives, and assume that it was
induced by reasons of business and indirect interest, but it was
not shown that as between the present and former defendants
either Hygienic company had the right to intermeddle in any
way in the conduct of the case. The Hygienic Companies
would have been glad to see the Rumford patent declared void
and were willing to pay something to that end. That was all
and that did not make them privies, and therefore the Clotworthy deposition was not admissible against them. Litchfield v. Goodnow, 123 U. S. 549, 550. Whether if it had been
admitted, infringement could have been inferred from the
sale of a barrel of granular acid phosphate to a manufacturer of
baking powder need not be considered. There was 'other evidence in the case.
Decree in No. 9 affirmed.
Decree in No.121 reversed.
