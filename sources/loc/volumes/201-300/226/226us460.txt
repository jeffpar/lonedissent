MARSHALL DENTAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY v. STATE OF IOWA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IOWA.

No.-104.

Argued December 19, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Qutere: Whether this court can go behind successive findings of the
Secretary of the Interior and the state court that a lake was properly
meandered and the lands within its area were not swamp. In this
case no reason appears for so doing.
By the law of Iowa riparian owners take only to the water's edge and
grants of the United States follow the state rule and convey no land
under an unnavigable lake.
The title to the bed of a meandered lake formerly within the public
domain of the United States, for which no patent has been issued,
either remains in the United States or has passed under the Swamp
Land Act to the State.
Under such circumstances a State has, by virtue of its sovereignty, an
interest sufficient to entitle it to maintain an action against one
intruding without title.
143 Iowa, 398, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the title to a meandered lake
in the State of Iowa, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. E. B. Evans for plaintiff in error.
Mr. George Cosson, Attorney General of Iowa, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition brought by the State of Iowa to enjoin the defendants from draining the waters of Goose
Lake, in Greene County, Iowa. The defendant, now

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff in error, set up title, on the ground that the so-

called lake, a tract of several hundred acres, was swamp
land and was granted to the State by the act of September 28, 1850, c. 84, 9 Stat. 520; Rev. Stats..ยง 2479; that it
passed to Greene County by an act of the legislature of
January 13, 1853, and thence by mesne conveyances to
this defendant. After a trial the court of first instance
entered a decree for the plaintiff, and the decree was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 143 Iowa,
398.
The material facts are few. In :the original survey by
the Government in 1853 the lake was meandered, which
meant under the instructions to surveyors then in force
that it was a lake or deep' pond, and no patent ever has
issued from the United States.. In 1903 the plaintiff in
error applied to the Secretary of the Interior to have the
land surveyed as swamp .[and, but the application was
refused, on the ground that it did not appear sufficiently
thatthere was not a lake there, as indicated, at the time
of the survey. If the question of fact was open under
(Hannibal& St. Joseph) Railroad Co. v. Smith, 9 Wall. 95,
the state courts found that Goose Lake was an unnavigable body of water proper to be meandered, and we see no
sufficient reason for going behind these successive findings,
if we had power to do so. Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v.
Cedar Rapids, 223 U. S.655, 668. See French v. Fyan, 93
U. S.169. McCormick v. Hayes, 159 U. S.332. It follows
that the plaintiff in error shows no title. By the law of
Iowa the riparian owners took title only to the water's
edge, and therefore the grants of the adjoining land by the
United States did not convey the land under the lake.
Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S.371. Hardin v. Shedd, 190
U. S.508. Whitaker v. McBride, 197 U. S.510, 512. It
follovxs that the bed of the lake either still belongs to the
United States or must be held to have passed to the State.
The question as to the title to the bed is treated as open

in Hardin v. Shedd, 190 U. S. 508, 519, and Whitaker v.
McBride, 197 U. S. 510, 515, and there is no need to decide
it now. It is enough to say that by virtue of its sovereignty the State of Iowa has an interest in the condition
of the lake sufficient to entitle it to maintain this suit
against an intruder without title, whether the State owns
the bed or not. This principle has been affirmed and
acted on by the court so recently that it does not require
further argument here. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,

KALANIANAOLE v. SMITHIES, TRUSTEE OF
COCKETT.
ERROR* TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

HAWAII.
No. 109.

Argued December 20, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

On a pure matter of form as to the parties in a suit coming here from
a court of a Territory, and where the whole interest in a judgment
sued upon was before that court, this court should not go behind the
local practice.

A joint judgment ceases to be joint by the death of one of the parties.
Where the joinder of an executor of a party whose interest has ceased
is simply a mistake, it is not reversible error.

20 Hawaii, 138, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. C. IF.-Ashford, for plaintiff in error,- submitted.
Mr. Ralph P. Quarles, with whom Mr. A. L. C. Atkinson was on thl biief, for dcfcnclant in error.
