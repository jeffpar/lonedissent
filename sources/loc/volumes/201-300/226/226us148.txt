"For if he should do so, the declaration would be more
prolix than was convenient." Hawkings v. Billhead, Cro.

goes in some sense to the jurisdiction of the court does not
necessarily take the case out of the general rules of pleading." Sawyer v. Boston, 144 Massachusetts, supra. It
would seem, as observed by the court below, that. the
defendant was free to renounce the objection if he saw fit.
We know of no public policy that would prevent his permitting the appellees to acquire rights that earlier they
were entitled to. So that on this ground as well as on that
of convenience we are of opinion that the general rule of
pleading applies.
The only matter remaining to be mentioned is a suggestion that the Supreme Court should have -sent the case
back to the lower court to give the appellant an opportunity to cross-examine the appellees, but there being no
question of the power of the Supreme Court- we should be
slow to control its discretion on this point.

An order to sell attached property on the ground that it is perishable
is not one to enforce the lien of the attachment but one incidental to
the preseivation of the pro0erty, and the court having the custody
has the jurisdiction to selL
A proceeding to sell perishable property is.
one in rem and the purchaser gets title against all the world.
A local court having the custody under attachment of perishable goods
may order a sale if necessary to protect and it is not necessary that
such sale be made under General Order XVIII, 3, in order to validate
it.

An order for sale of perishable property held under attachment, made
by the local court within the terms of the local act, will not be set
aside by this court.
Even if the local'statute permitting sales of perishable property held
in custodia legis be broader than General Order XVIII, .3,
this court
will not for that reason only set aside a sale made by the local court
if within the terms of the local act.
As to whether property is perishable or not, this court will follow the
rulings of a territorial court in the absence of a strong reason to
the contrary.

purchaser had actual knoWledge of the bankruptcy proceedings.
No order confirming said sale to appellee was entered
prior, to the appearance of the trustee in bankruptcy in
said cause, and although the court found that the sale
was confirmed on July 17, such finding is not supported
by the record. The court also found that the purchaser
knew of the bankruptcy proceedings on June 26, two weeks
after his purchase.

Opinion Of the Court.

The word "perishable" is very elastic. It does not
mean simply property liable to decay. It should receive
a liberal rather than a narrow construction and embraces
property the keeping of which may render it of no value
in the end to satisfy the claims, and in this sense almost
any property subject to attachment may be sold as perishable. McCreery v. Barney National Bank, 116 Alabama,
224; Young v. Davis, 30 Alabama, 113; Schumann v.
Davis, 13 N. Y. Supp. 575; Southern Railroad Co. v.
Sheppard, 20 S. E. Rep. 481; Anonymous v. Horse and
Chaise, 18 N. J. Law, 26; Mosher v. Bay Circuit Judge,
108 Michigan, 579.
Appellee is a bonafide purchaser for value of the dredge,
and his title is recognized and protected by the very provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which opposing counsel contend have destroyed or prevented the acquisition by him
of his title. Clark v. Larremore, 188 U. S. 486; In re
Franks, 95 Fed. Rep. 635.
The Bankruptcy Act does not by any of its provisions
make the fact of adjudication constructive notice. As to
who is a bona fide purchaser at common law, see Spicer v.
Waters, 65 Barb. 227; Perry on Trusts, 218; Alden v.
Trubee, 44 Connecticut, 455.
MR. JUSTICE HoLMWEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes here upon appeal from a judgment
denying the title of the appellant as'trustee in bankruptcy
to property formerly belonging to the bankrupt and sold
in this suit by order of the local court. The facts are
these. The property in question is a mining dredge. It
was attached on February 27, 1906, and a receiver was
appointed on March 19. On May 1, a petition was filed
for an order directing the dredge to be sold on the ground
that it was 'of a perishable nature, and liable to be lost or
diminished in, value before the final adjudication of the

226 U. S.

case,' within the Compiled Laws of New Mexico, 1897,
§ 2716; and an order to that effect was made on the same
day. The ground of the finding on which the sale was
ordered was that the dredge was anchored in an embanked pond fed by a mountain stream subject to heavy
floods, and was liable to damage from that source. The
sale took place on June 26, and the dredge was bought in
good faith and without notice of the defendant's insolvency, at a price of five thousand dollars paid into court,
by the appellee, Springer. The sale was confirmed on
July 17. 'But on March 12, 1906, a petition in bankruptcy
had been filed in the Northern District of Illinois against
the Oro Dredging Company, the defendant in this suit.
On April 23, the company was adjudged a bankrupt. On
July 9, the appellant was appointed trustee and on July 19
qualified. On August 2, he first appeared in this cause,
that being the first notice of the adjudication received by
the parties concerned or the court. He filed an intervening petition praying that the order of sale be set 'aside, the
attachment dissolved and the property turned over to
him. The petition so ,far as it affects the dredge was
denied, the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court
of the Territory and the trustee appealed.
The main ground of the appeal is that by § 70 of the
Bankruptcy Act the title of the trustee related back to the
date of the adjudication of bankruptcy, and that, as
matter of law, Springer could not be a bona fide purchaser
within the proviso of § 67f saving the title of a bona fide
purchaser for value who shall have acquired the property
by the attachment without notice or reasonable cause for inquiry. It is argued that filingthe petition in bankruptcywas
a caveat to all the world, Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S.1, 14,
and that the above proviso can have effect only when the
judgment and sale took place before the petition was filed.
We have no occasion to' consider the last proposition
in order to decide this case, or what effect, if any, the pro-

viso has upon some language in Conner v. Long, 104 U. S.
228, relied upon by the appellant (see Clarke v. Larremore,
188 U. S. 486, 488), the proceeding not having been one
to enforce the lien of the attachment but simply an order
made on a finding that, in the language of the New Mexico
statute, 'the interests of both plaintiff and-defendant will
be promoted by the sale of the property.' But the proposition quoted from Mueller v. Nugent -must be taken
with reference to the facts then before the court and not
as applicable to all intents and purposes. York Manufacturing Co. v. Cassell, 201 U. S. 344, 353. Hiscock v.
Varick Bank, 206 U. S. 28, 41. In re Rathman, 183 Fed.
Rep. 913, 924, 925. It is trae that the estate is regarded
as in custodia legis from the (late of the petition as against
a subsequent attachment. Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., 222 U. S; .300, 306, 307. But in a case
like the present where, under an attachment levied before
the petition. was filed, the property had been put into the
hands of a receiver, without, notice of the petition, it is.
not true that all power and jurisdiction of the local court
were ended before notice of the bankruptcy proceedings.

The jurisdiction of the teritorial court not having been
avoided and that court haviing the actual custody of the
res, it had the power to preserve the subject-matter of the
controversy that necessarily is incident to such conditions.
An illustration although not a perfect analogy is to be
found in United States v. Shipp, 203 U., S. 563, 573. An
appeal had. been taken to this court on 'a,petition for
habeas corpus, where a prisoner was held under sentence
of a state court, and pending the appeal this court had
ordered the custody of the appellant to be retained.
Shipp was charged with contempt for having been party

to a conspiracy that ended in lynching the prisoner. It
was strongly, argued that neither the Circuit Court that
refused the writ nor this court had any jurisdiction of the
case, but it was held that,, whether it had jurisdiction or
not, until the. question was decided this court had authority from the necessity of the case. to preserve the subject of the petition. A similar authority existed in the
territorial court until the trustee saw fit to intervene,
which, so far as would have appeared at the time of the
sale had anyone known of the bankruptcy proceedings,
he might. never do. According to Marshall, C. J., "a
right to.order a sale is for the benefit of all parties, not
because the case is depending in that particular court,
but because the thing may perish while in its' custody,
and while neither party can enjoy its use." Jennings v.
Carson; 4 Cranch, 2, 26. The recognition of a power
springing from necessity is of old standing in English law.

Le Vay, 125 Fed. Rep. 990, 992.
It is argued that' if a sale was necessary the court of
bankruptcy could have directed it under General Order
XVIII, 3, and that its power was exclusive. But such a
rule would much impair the usefulness of the principle.
The'trustee if appointed may not know the condition of
the property or be prepared to decide. The court having
the actual custody of the res does not know of the bankruptcy proceedings. There is a necessity for immediate
action and nO one is ready to act. If the local court in its
ignorance directs a sale and the purchaser is chargeable
with notice that there may be somewhere a petition filed
that*will destroy his title, the doubt affects the price that
he will give, and -if the sale turns out effective the goods
have been sacrificed, The very reason of the rule that
permits a good title to be given by an authority that has

none contradicts the limitation supposed. We are of
opinion that the power of the territorial court remained.
"For necessity (which is excepted out of the law) the sale
in that case is good." '2 Inst. 168. The proceeding is in
rem, against all the world, the sale stands, and the claim
of the trustee is transferred to the proceeds, which ordinarily must be presumed to represent the fair value of
the goods and take their place.
* Finally it is argued that the court of bankruptcy must
decide whether the property is perishable or not, and that
this property was not within the power conferred by the
statute of New Mexico. The first proposition is little
more than the one last discussed in another form. But
assuming that.'for any reason we could go behind the
findings on which the case comes here we see no reason.
for doing so, if the sale was within the terms of the local
act. On that question, as usual, we follow the ruling of
the Supreme Court of the Territory unless there are
stronger reasons to the contrary than are shown here.
