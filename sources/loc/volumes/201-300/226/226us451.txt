GERSCH v. CHICAGO.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS EX REL.
GERSCH, v. CITY OF CHICAGO ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 474.

Submitted December 16, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Where the record does not contain the final judgment to which the
writ of error-is directed this court cannot assume that a judgment
was entered and is without authority to exert jurisdiction.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John W. Beckwith and Mr. W. H. Sexton, for the
defendants in error, in support of motion to dismiss or
affirm.

Mr. Allen B. Chilcoat and Mr. Stephen A. Day, for the
plaintiff in error, in opposition thereto.
Memorandum opinion, by direction of the court, by
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.

This is a companion case to Preston v. City of Chicago,
No. 195, just disposed of. Unlike the record in the-Preston

case, however, the record in this case does not contain the
final judgment to which the writ of error is directed. As
we cannot assume that a Judgment was in fact entered
in the Supreme Court of ]:llinois, it results that we are
without authority to exert jurisdiction.
Writ of error dismissed.
