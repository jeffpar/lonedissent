stock into the hands of the receiver. The report of the
master was confirmed by the District Court (189 Fed.
Rep. 432, 437), and the action of that court was in all
respects affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (193
Fed. Rep. 24). This appeal was then taken, and the claim
of the Princeton Bank has been specially presented, under
an agreement that the decision as to that claim will govern
as to the others.
All the contentions relied upon in various forms simply
assert that the master and the two courts erred in their
appreciation of the facts. But the burden of proof was.
upon the claimant to establish its ownership of the fund,
a burden which it cannot in reason be said was sustained
in view of the concurrent adverse action of the master and
the courts below. Indeed as the settled rule is that the
concurrent action of two courts upon questions of fact
will not be disturbed except in a Case of manifest error, a
condition which we are of the opinion after an examination.of the record does not here obtain, it follows that the
judgment below must be and it is
Affirmed.

SELOVER, BATES AND COMPANY v. WALSH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.
No. 22.

Submitted October 29, 1912.-Decided' December 2, 1912.

With the ruling of the state court as to the applicability of a state statute to a particular contract this court has nothing, to do. It is concerned only with the question of whether as so applied the law
violates the Federal Constitution.
The court may, through action upon, or constraint of, the person
within its jurisdiction, affect property in other States.
The obligation of a contract is the law under which it was made, even.
though it may affect lands in another State; and in an action which

SELOVER, BATES & CO. v. WALSH.
226 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in. Error.

does not affect the land itself but which is strictly personal, the law
of the State where the contract is made gives the right and measure
of recovery.
A contract made in one State for the sale of land in another can be
enforced in the former according to the lex loci contractu and not
according to the lex rei sitae. Polson v. Stewart, 167 'Massachusetts,
211, approved.
Where the state court has construed a state law as applied to the case
at bar, this court will presume that the state court will make the
statute effective as so construed in other cases. This court will not
anticipate the ruling of the state court.
A state statute providing that the vendor .of lands cannot cancel the
coitract without reasonable written notice with opportunity to the
vendee to comply with the terms is within the police power of the
State; and so held that Chapter 223 of the Laws of 1897 of Minnesota
is not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment as depriving a vendor of his property without due process of law or denying
him the equal protection of the law.
The test of equal protection of the law is whether all parties are treated
alike in the-same situation.
Contentions as to unconstitutionality of a state statute not made in,
the. court below cannot be made in this court..
A corporation cannot claim the protection of the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which secures the privileges and immunities of
citizens of the United States against abridgment or impairment by
the laws of a State. Western Turf -Association v. Greenburg, 204
U. S. 359.
109 Minnesota, 136, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of a contract
made in Minnesota for sale of land situated in Colorado,
and the application thereto of a statute of Minnesota, are
stated in the opinion.
Mr. Arthur W. Selover for plaintiff in error:
The lex loci rei sitte applies to all matters with reference
to the transfer of lands, including contracts for the purchase and sale thereof.
The law of the State in which mortgaged property is
situated governs the redemption.

Mr. A. B. Choate and Mr. George W. Buffington for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
Error to the Supreme Court of Minnesota to review a
judgment of that court awarding damages to defendant
in error for a breach by plaintiff in error of an executory
contract for the sale of land' situated in the State of
Colorado.
The contract was made by one Bates. for plaintiff in
error at the office Of the lAtter, in the city of Minneapolis,
he being one of its officers, with P. D. Walsh, the husband,
of defendant in error. Walsh, however, actually signed
the contract at his residence in 'South Dakota. He subsequently assigned his interest to her as Bates did to
plaintiff in error.
Plaintiff in'error, asserting that Walsh had made default
of the terms of the contract, canceled it and subsequently
sold the land to other parties. This action was then
brought by defendant in error, resulting in a judgment for.
her which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 109
Minnesota, 136.
By the contract Bates, the assignor of plaintiff in error,
covenanted to convey the land to Walsh, the assignor of
defendant in error, reserving certain'mining rights therein.
Payments were to 'be made in installments at the office of
plaintiff in error in Minneapolis, punctually, and it was
stipulated "that time and punctuality." were "mnaterial
and essential ingredients" of the contract.* It was covenanted that in case of failure to make the payments

SELOVER, BATES &, CO. v. WALSH.

Opinion of the Court.

"punctually and upon the strict terms and times" limited,
and upon default thereof or in the strict and literal performance of any other covenant, the contract, at the option of the party of the first part (Bates) should become
utterly null and void and the rights of the party of the
second part (Walsh) should "at the option of the party
of the first part utterly cease and determine" as if "the
contract had never been made." There was forfeiture of
the sums paid and a reversion of all rights conveyed,. including the right to take inunediate possession of the land.
"without process of law," and it was covenanted that
no court should "relieve the party of the second part upon
failure to comply strictly and literally" with the contract.
The default of Walsh-consisted in the failure to pay
taxes, and plaintiff in error elected to terminate the contract, and gave notice of such election to him in writing
in the State of North Dakota. Against the effect of such
default and notice defendant in error opposed Chapter 223,
Laws of Minnesota (Laws of 1897, p. 431), which provides
that a vendor in a contract for the sale of land-shall have
no right to cancel, terminate or declare a forfeiture of the
contract except upon thirty days' written notice to the
vendee and that the latter. shall have thirty days after
service of such notice 'in
whLich to perform the conditions
or comply with the provisions "upon which default shall
have occurred.
The trial court and the Supreme Court held the statute
applicable and judgment went, as-we have said, for defendant in error. This ruling is attacked on the ground
that as so applied the statute offends against the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States in that it deprives plaintiff in error of its property
.without due process of law and of the equal protection of
the laws.
With the ruling of the couxt as to the applicability of the
statute to the contract we have nothing to do. We are

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

226 U. S.

only concerned with the contention that,, as so applied, it
violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Of this the Supreme
Court said (p. 138):
"There can be no serious question as to the constitutionality of the statute. It in effect prescribes a period of
redemption in contracts of this character, and was within
the power and authority of the legislature. Defendants'
principal contention on this branch of the case is. not so
much that the statute is unconstitutional as that it should
not be construed to apply to contracts made in Minnesota
for the sale of land in another state. There is force in this
contention; but within the rule of the Finnes Case, which
a majority of the court do not feel disposed to reconsider,
the action does not involve the title to the land, 'is purely
personal, and the rights of the parties are controlled by
the laws of this State. Under the decision in that case,
defendants had no right arbitrarily to declare the contract
at an end and refuse to perform it, and are liable for such
damages as their refusal caused plaintiff. Following the
Finnes Case, we have no alternative but to affirm the
action of the court below."
This excerpt clearly presents the ground of the couit's
decision, and we may put in contrast to it the contention
of plaintiff in error. Its contention is that the contract
itself provided for the manner of its termination and made
exact punctuality the essence of its obligation, and that
the statute of the State, as it exempts from such obligation,
deprives plaintiff in error of its prolerty without due process of law. The argument to support the contention is
somewhat confused, as it mingles with the right of contract simply a consideration of the State's jurisdiction
over the land which was the subject of the contract. As
to, the c6ntract simply we have no doubt of the State's
power over it, and the law 'of the State, 'therefore,. constituted part of it. It is elementary that the obligation of
..a contract is the law under which it was made, and we are

Opinion of the Court.

not disposed to expend much time to show that the
Minnesota statute was a valid exercise of the police power
of the State. C,, B. & Q. R. R. Co'. v. McGuire, 219 U. S.
549; Broadnax v. MissourE, Id. 285. Whether it had
extra-territorial effect is another question. The conten.tion is that the statute as applied affected the transfer of
land situated in another State and outside of, therefore,
the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. In other
words, it is contended that the'law of Colorado, the situs
of the property, is the law of the contract. The principle
is asserted in many ways arnd with an affluent citation of
cases. The principle cannot be contested, but plaintiff
in error pushes it too far. Courts in many ways through
action upon or constraint of the person affect property in
other States (Fallv. Eastin, 215 U. S.1), and in the case
at bar the action is strictly personal. It in no way affects
the land or seeks any remedy against it. The land had
been conveyed to another by plaintiff in error and it was
secure in the possession, of the purchaser. Redress was
sought in a Minnesota court for the violation of a Minnesota contract, and, being such, the law of Minnesota gave
the right and measure of recovery'
In Polson v. Stewart, 167 Massachusetts, 211, a contract
niade in North Carolina between a husband and wife, who
were domiciled there, by which he covenanted to surrender, convey and transfer all of his rights to lands owned
by her in Massachusetts, was declared to be a North
Carolina contract and enforceable in Massachusetts notwithstanding that under the law of the latter State hus.band aid wife' were incapable of contracting with each
other. To the objection that the laws of the parties'
domicile could not authorize a contract between them as
to lands in Massachusetts, it was ansWered (p. 214), "Obviously this is not true. It is true that the laws of other
States cannot render valid conveyances to property
within our borders which our laws say are void, for the

124

plain reason that we have exclusive power over the
res ,..
But the same reason inverted establishes
that the lex rei.site cannot control personal covenants, not
pdrporting to be conveyances, between persons outside the
jurisdiction, although-concerning a thing within it. What-ever the covenant, the laws of North Carolina could subject the defendant's property to seizure on execution, and
his person to. impris'onment, for a failure to perform it.
Therefore, on principle, the law of North Carolina determines lie validity of the contract." Precedents against the
view were noted and contrasted with. those supporting it.
The case at bar is certainly within the principle expressed in Polsonov. Stewart. :The Minnesota Supreme
,Court followed the prior decision in Finnes v. Selover,
Bates & -Co., 102 Minnesota,. 334, in which it said (p. 337)'
that upon repudiation of a- contract by the seller of -land
two courses were open to the purchaser: "He might stand
by' the contract and seek to recover the land, or he could
declare upon a. breach of the contract and recover the
amount 'of his'damages." If he elected the former, it was
further said, the courts of Colorado alone could give him
relief; if he sought redress in damages the courts of Minnesota were open to him. And this, it was observed, was in
accordance with the principle that the law of the situs
governs as to the land, and the law of the contract as to
the rights of the parties in the contract.
Plaintiff in error bases a contention upon the difficulty
of complying with the provisions of the statute with regard
to giving notice. Written notice is, as we have seen,
necessary to be given of any default, and the time when
the cancellation. of the contract shall take effect, which
must not be less than thirty days after the service; and
it is provided that the notice must be served in the manner
provided for service' of summons in the District Court if
the vendee resides in the county where' the real estate covered by the 'contract is situated. If the vendee is not

Opinion of the Court.

within the county where the real estate i§ situated, then
notice must be served by ,publication in a weekly newspaper within the county, or, if there is none in the county,

then in a newspaper published at the capital of the State.
And it is provided that the vendee shall have thirty days
after service to ,perform the conditions or comply with the
provisions. The contention is that these provisions cannot
be complied with either in Minnesota or Colorado and
that plaintiff in error is brought to the dilemma of not
being able to cancel the contract whatever be the default.
The dilemma was not presented to the Supreme Court
of the State for resolution, as plaintiff in error had made
no attempt to comply with the statute in any way. As
that court held the statute applicable to contracts such
as that under review, it will, no doubt, in a proper case,' so
construe the statute as to make it effective. We are not
called upon to anticipate its ruling.
It is manifest from these views that plaintiff :in error
was not by the enforcement of the Minnesota statute deprived of its property. without .due process of law.
It is further contended that the Minnesota statute denies
plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws and is
therefore void. In specification of the way in which this
is done plaintiff in error says: ",In so far as the State of
Minnesota penalizes its resident owner because he has
obeyed the'laws of the State or country wherein the land
is situated-the law which he mdst be subject to-just so
far does it exceed its powers and deny to' its citizens the
equal protection of the laws." This manifestly is but
another way of presenting the argument, which we have
answered, that the law of Colorado controls the contract
and not the law of Minnesota. Discrimination is not'
made out by -saying that resident owners of Minnesota
land are given a right to foreclose their contracts and that
residents of-Minnesota owning land in other States are not
given the same right, even. if this were true. The plaintiff

.n error is not treated differently from any other seller of
*land in his situation. This is the. test of the application
of the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the
United States..
Plaintiff in error further charges that the Supreme Court
of the State refused to give full faith and credit to the
acts and records of Colorado. The contention was not
"made in the court below and cannot be made here. The
Same cIomment is, applicable to the contention that privileges and immunities of plaintiff in.error as a citizen of the
United States are abridged. We may say of the contentions that. they are but' a repetition of the view that the
laW of Colorado and not that of Minnesota governs ihe
contract. And we may say further it is well settled that
a corporation cannot claim the protection of the clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment which secures the privileges
and immunities of citizens-of the United States against
abridgment or impairment by the law of a State. Weslern
