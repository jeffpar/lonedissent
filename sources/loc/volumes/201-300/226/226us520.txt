for the purpose of obtaining the lower of alternative rates
was admissible under the provisions of § 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 584,
c. 3591.
The Circuit Court instructed a verdict for the agreed
value, ruling that the contract was valid and was controlled by the Interstate Cofimerce Acts. The Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed this judgment, upon the
ground that the contract was invalid under the constitution of the State of Nebraska, and held the plaintiff entitled to recover the full value of the animals. 172 Fed.
Rep. 850. The case was remanded to the Circuit Couit,
where, in pursuance of the judgment and opinion of the
Circuit Court of Appeals, the jury was instructed that it
should find the actual value of the animals lost and return
a verdict for that amount. Upon a second writ of error
this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the cause has come to this court upon a writ
of certiorari.
The case is governed by the cases of Adams Express
Company v. Croninger, and C., B. & Q. Ry. v. Miller,
both just decided.
Judgment reversed and the case is remandedfor a new trial.

McNAMARA v. HENKEL, UNITED STATES MARSHAL FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 687. Argued December 4, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Under § 5270, Rev. Stat., if the committing magistrate has jurisdiction
and the offense charged is within the treaty and there is legal evidence

Argument for Appellant.

on which to exercise his judgment as to sufficiency. of the facts to
establish criminality for purposes of extradition, the decision of
the magistrate cannot be reviewed on habeas corpus.
In this case there was competent evidence that the crime of burglary
as defined by the law of the State where accused was arrested had
been committed and extradition was properly granted under the
treaties with Great Britain of 1842 and 1889.
Possession of the article stolen my tend to show guilty participation
in the burglary, and so held in this case as to possession of an autoWmobile.
Evidence should, if unexplained, be accorded its natural probative
force.
Habeas corpus does not operate as a writ of error and mere errors are
not subject to review, and so hel!d as to an objection that depositions
used in an extradition case were not properly certified.

THE facts, which involve the legality of an order of
commitment for extradition, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George Gordon Battle for appellant:
While a writ of habeas corpus does not perform the
functions of a writ of error, the court will nevertheless go
behind the commitment to ascertain whether there was
any legal evidence to give the Commissioner jurisdiction.
The two general propositions of law which govern extradition proceedings are:
-The law of the State where the alleged fugitive is apprehended must dominate. Pettit v. Walshe, 194 U. S.
205, 217; Wright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 41, 58; In re Frank,
107 Fed. Rep. 272; United States v. Greene, 100 Fed. Rep.
941; In re Ezeta, 62 Fed. Rep. 972, 981.
There must be such competent evidence of probable
cause as would justify a committing magistrate hearing a
like proceeding in the State of New York in holding the
alleged fugitive. Benson v. McMahon, 127 U. S. 457;

There is no legal or competent evidence in the case at
bar to show that a crime has been committed, or that the
appellant committed the crime.
The evidence offered by the demanding government
in support of two separate charges-of feloniously breaking into and entering the branch of the Bank of Montreal
and of feloniously breaking into and entering Trapp's
garage-was so co-mingled and intermixed in its presentation to the Commissioner, in that the second proceeding
was commenced before the first was finally determined,
that the Commissioner had no right to receive the evidence at all, or to base an order in either proceeding
upon it.
There is no precedent for the hearing of two distinct and
separate extradition proceedings at the same time, and
the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to receive testimony
in support of the second warrant before the first proceeding had been concluded.
Probable'cause must exist to believe that a crime has
been committed and that the defendant has committed it
before he properly can be held for trial. United States

226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. CharsFox for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the

court.
John McNamara, the appellant, was arrested on the
complaint of the: British Senior Vice-Consul at the Port
of New York charging him with committing the crime
of burglary at New Westninster, British Columbia, in
breaking into a building occupied as a garage and stealing
therefrom an automobile and rugs. Examination was
demanded, and after hearing the evidence submitted on
both sides the United States Commissioner found probable
cause and issued an order of commitment for extradition.
Writs of habeas corpus and certiorariwere then sued out
upon the ground that the accused was restrained of his
liberty without due process of law. The District Court
dismissed the writs and this appeal is brought.
The question simply is whether there was any competent
evidence before the Commissioner entitling him to act
under the statute. The weight of the evidence was for
his determination. The statute provides that if on the
hearing, "he deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the
charge," he shall certify the same to the Secretary of
State and issue his warrant for the commitment of the
accused pending surrender according to the stipulations
of the treaty. Rev. Stat., § 5270. Under this provision,
the rule is well established that if the committing magistrate has jurisdiction of the subject-m atter and of the
accused, and the offense charged is within the treaty, andthe magistrate has before him legal evidence on which
to exercise his judgment as to the sufficiency of the facts
to establish the criminality of the accused for the purposes
of extraditioi, his decision cannot be reviewed on habeas
corpus. In re Oteiza y Cortez, 136 U. S.330, 334; Benson v.
McMahon, 127 U. S. 457, 463; In re Stupp, 12 Blatchf. 501;

States, 167 U. S. 104, 105; Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S.

Glucksman v. Henkel, 221 U. S. 508, 512.
Without setting forth in detail the facts appearing
from the depositions and testimony before the Commissioner, it is sufficient to say that there was competent
evidence that the crime of burglary as defined by the law
of New York where the appellant was arrested (Treaty
with Great Britain, 1842, Art. X, 8 Stat. 572, 576; Treaty
of 1889, Art. I, 26 Stat. 1508, 1509; Penal Law (N. Y.),
§§ 400, 404) had been committed by a breaking into the
building in question with intent to steal the automobile
there kept. It was shown that this took place between
four and six o'clock on the morning of September 15th,
1911. The car was taken out of the building and rolled
about forty feet down the street, where shortly before
six o'clock on that morning, according to testimony, the
appellant was seen standing in front of the car "trying
to crank it;" "he was trying," said the witness, "to start
the machine off." Three men, unidentified, were with
him. On an examination of the car soon after, it was
found that the cover had been remoired from the spark
coil and that several of the electric wires forming part of
the motive equipment had been disarranged in an effort,
apparently, to operate the car despite the absence of a
switch plug.
The District Court held that this was evidence connecting the appellant with the crime upon which, in the light
of the circumstances proved,. the Commissioner was entitled to exercise his judgment. We agree with this view.
Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 619, 620. It is
objected that while possession of property recently stolen
may be evidence of participation in the larceny, the apparent possession of the automobile by the appellant

UNITED STATES v. PATTEN.

Syllabus.

affords no support for a conclusion that he committed
the burglary, the crime with which he was charged. The
permissible inference is not thus' to be limited. The evidence pointed to the appellant as one having control of
the car and engaged in the endeavor to secure the fruits
of the burglarious entry. Possession in these circumstances tended to show guilty participation in the burglary. This is but to accord to the evidence, if unexplained,
its natural probative force. Considine v. United States,
112 Fed. Rep. 342, 349, 350; Commonwealth v. McGorty,
114 Massachusetts, 299; Knickerbocker v. The People,
43 N. Y. 177, 181; Ne.ubrandt v. State, 53 Wisconsin, 89;
State v. Fitzgerald, 72 ,Vermont, 142.
. It is assigned as error that the Commissioner received
in evidence certain depositions taken in British Columbia
which were certified by the Consul-General of the United
States as depositions proposed to be used upon an application for the extradition of the appellant upon another
charge. We need not consider the sufficiency of this certificate, as the writ of habeas corpus does not operate as a
writ of error and mere errors are not the subject of review.
Benson v. McMahon, 127 U. S.457, 461, 462; Terlinden v.
Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 278. 'Irrespective of the depositions
objected to, there was legal evidence on which to base
the Commissioner's action.
Affirmed.
