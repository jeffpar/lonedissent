Statement of the Case.

St. 635; 67 N. E. Rep. 1062; Luther v. State (Nebraska),
20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1146; Pennell v. State, 141 Wisconsin,
35; 123 N. W. Rep. 115. We cannot say that there is no
basis for this widespread coniction.
The State, within the limits we have stated, must decide
upon the measures that are needful for the protection of
its people, and, having regard-to the artifices which are
used to promote the sale of intoxicants under the guise of
innocent beverages, it would constitute an unwarrantable
departure from accepted principle to hold that the prohibition of the sale of all malt liquors, including the
beverage in question, was beyond its reserved power.

BUCK STOVE AND RANGE CO. v. VICKERS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT. OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
•No. 10. Argued December.19, 1911.-Decided December 2, 1912.
Rev. Stat., § 1011, providing that there shall be no reversal in this
court upon a writ of error for eror in ruling on any plea of abatement other than one to the jurisdiction of the court, does not apply to
writs of eror to state courts but only to lower Federal ourts.
The subdivision and rearrangemeft of § 22 of the Judiciary Act of
1789 in the Revised Statutes of 1873 did not work any change in
the purpose and meaning of the original act.
The statute of Kansas of 1905, requiring certain classes of foreign corporations to fie statements is an invalid restriction and burden and
unconstitutional as to foreign corporations engaged in interstate commerce, under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. In-

of corporations of other States to do business in Kansas,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Seneca N. Taylor and Mr. Malcolm B. Nicholson,
with whom Mr. William J. Pirtle was on the brief, for
plaintiffs in error:
There is no misjoinder of plaintiffs in error. Kansas
City v. King, 65 Kansas, 65.
Plaintiffs in error having been engaged exclusively in
interstate commerce, the application of the corporation
laws of Kansas to them is repugnant to the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States,
and such application cannot lawfully be made. Cooper
Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson and Harrison, 113 U. S. 727.
Plaintiffs in error were entitled to bring and maintain
these suits in the courts of the State of Kansas upon the
same terms and upon the same footing as an individual
citizen of the States of their creation, and of which these
corporations were citizens, under § 2, Art. IV of the Constitution of the United States. 133 U. S. 107.
The manner of these people in dealing with the citizens
of Kansas is interstate commerce. Stockard v. Morgan,
185 U. S. 27; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Welton
v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist., 120 U. S. 489; 1 I. C. C. Rep. 45.
State statutes requiring foreign corporations to comply
with certain conditions before doing business in the State
have frequently been held inapplicable to a foreign corporation whose only business in the State is selling through
traveling agents and delivering goods manufactured outside of the State, since any other construction of the
statute would render it void as an interference with
interstate commerce. Havens & G. Co. v. Diamond, 93

Plaintiffs in error had a vested right to maintain and
prosecute the suits to judgment.
The judgments upon which these suits were founded
were obtained in November, 1895, and these suits were
commenced June 13, 1896. Chapter 10 of the laws passed
by the special session, 1898, bedame effective on January 11, 1899, two years and six months after these suits
were commenced.
Before the passage of that law the courts of the State
were open to all corporations alike, foreign and domestic,
and no restrictions of any kind placed upon foreign corporations to come into the courts of the State of Kansas
and seek their remedy against any of its citizens.
It is not within the power of the legislature to deprive
these plaintiffs -of the remedy by casting a pecuniary
burden upon them.
Plaintiffs in error, having commenced the suits long
prior to the enactment of the "law in question, had a
vested right to maintain such suits and prosecute them to
judgment, and were protected in such right by § 10,
Art. I, of the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting
the States from passing any law impairing the obligation
of contracts. This court has repeatedly decided that the
remedy is a part of the contract, and any legislative act
that deprives a party of a remedy is repugnant to the
provisions of said § 10. Osborn v. Nicholson, 13 Wall.

The question here presented is as to the right of a
foreign corporation to prosecute an action for a tort in a

and the reason for its denial is that the plaintiffs have
refused to comply with a police requirement now almost
universally found in the legislation of the States. Interstate commerce is not primarily or secondarily affected
by the decision under consideration.

transaction of business.
The statute has no special- reference to commerce,
.much less to interstate commerce. It was nbt passed to
regulate commerce, but to make certain information as to
the affairs of corporations available to the citizens. The
penalty imposed for failure to furnish that information is
a temporary suspension of the right 'to exercise, not all,
but one corporate function, that of suing in a court of the
State, during the period of delinquency. The act deals
exclusively with the exercise of corporate powers, a subject ,over which-the power of the legislature is absolute.

subject the land included therein to the satisfaction
of their several judgments. The plaintiffs were corporations organized under the laws of States other than
Kansas, and four of them were doing a purely interstate
business in that State, but without complying with its laws
presently to be mentioned. The defendants set up this
non-compliance by an answer in the nature of a plea in
abatement, and the court. sustained the plea and dismissed the suits as to the four plaintiffs. As to the other
three plaintiffs, relief was denied for other reasons, which
need not be stated. The judgment was affirmed by the
Supreme- Court of the State, against the contention that
the ,laws of Kansas under which the plea in abatement was
sustained are violative of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, 80 Kansas, 29, and then
the case was brought here.
Some minor questions of appellate practice were urged
upon our attention, but their statement and consideration have become unnecessary through the concession of
counsel for plaintiffs in error, made during the oral argument and acted upon at the time, that the writ of error
might be dismissed as to the Aultman and Miller Buckeye
Co., the Consolidated Steel and Wire Co., and the Galveston Rope Co. Therefore,, attention need be given only
to the ruling upon the plea in abatement.
IOur power to review this ruling is challenged, because
of the statutory provision that there shall be no reversal
in this court upon a writ of error "for error in ruling any
plea in, abatement, other than a plea to the jurisdiction
of the court." Rev. Stat.,. § 1011. This provision has
been part of the judiciary acts from the- beginning, and
often has been applied upon writs of error to the circuit
and district courts, but never to a case coming here from
a state court. Piquignot v. PennsylvaniaRailroad Co., 16
How. 104, and Stephens v. Monongahela Bank, i1 ji . S.
197, illustrate its application in cases brought here from

BUCK STOVE CO. v. VICKERS.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

circuit courts, and Internati;onalTextbook Co. v. Pigg, 217
U. S. 91, and International Textbook Co. v. Lynch, 218
U. S. 664, are cases in which it was not applied upon writs
of error to state courts. This difference in the treatment
of the two classes of cases has not been inadvertent but
deliberate, and the reason for it is at once apparent when
§ 22 of the original Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 84, c. 20, is
examined. The provision originated in that section and
was there associated with other provisions which unmistakably show that it was intended to embrace only writs
of error to the circuit and district courts. At the time of
the revision in 1873, § 22 was divided into several shorter
sections and included in the revision according to an
arrangement, adopted foi purposes of convenience only,
whereby the several parts of the original section became
more or less separated; but that, in the absence of some
substantial change in phraseology, did not work any
change in their purpose or meaning. Rev. Stat., § 5600;
,Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S.347, 361; McDonald v.
Hovey, 110 U. S. 619. This is a writ of error to a state
court, and so: our power to review the ruling upon the
plea in abatement is not affected by § 1011.
The statute of Kansas under which the plea was sustained is embodied in the General Statutes of 1905, and
provides, in §§ 1332-1336, that to entitle a corporation
organized under the laws of another State to do business
in Kansas it must (a) make application to, and obtain the
permission of, the Charter J3oard of the State, (b) accompany its application with a fee of $25.00, (c) file with the
Secretary of State -its irrevocable consent that process
against it may be served upon that officer, (d) be'organized for a purpose for which. a domestic corporation may
be organized, (e).pay to the'State Treasurer, for the benefit of the permanent school fund, a specified per cent. of
its authorized capital, and (f) file with the Secretary of
State a certified copy of its charter. And by § 1358 the

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

226 U. S.

statute provides that each corporation for profit, doing
business in the State, except banking, insurance and railroad corporations, shall annually prepare and deliver to
the Secretary of State a complete and detailed statement,
exhibiting: "1st. The authorized capital stock. 2nd. The
paid-up capital stock. 3rd. The par value and the market
value per share of said stock. 4th. A complete and detailed statement of the assets and liabilities of the corporatiori. 5th. A full and complete list of the stockholders, with
the postoffice address of each, and the number of shares
held and paid for by each. 6th. The names and postoffipe
addresses of the officers, trustees or directors and manager,
elected for the ensuing year, together with a certificate of
the time and manner in which such election was held."
This section further provides that a failure to file such
statement by any corporation doing business in the
State and not organized under its laws shall work a forfeiture of the right or authority tor do business in the
State, and that" No action shall be maintained or recovery
had in any of the courts of this State by any corporation
doing business in this State without first obtaining the
certificate of the. Secretary of State that statements pro-.
vided for in this section have been properly made."
The four corporations against which the plea was sus-,

tained were corporations for profit organized under the
laws of States other-than Kansas, were not banking, insurance or railroad corporations, were doing business, in
Kansas-a purely interstate business-and had not complied with the statute just described. There can be no
doubt, therefore, that if the statute, especially § 1358, iz
valid as against such corporations, the plea was rightly
sustained; otherwise, it should have been overruled. So,
the question for decision is, whether, consistently with
the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United
States, a State may thus restrict and burden the right to
do interstate business within its limits. This precise

BUCK STOVE CO. v. VICKERS.

Opinion of the Court.

question was presented to this court and decided in the
negative in the case of International Textbook Co. v. Pigg,
217 U. S.91, a case in which the Supreme Court of Kansas
had applied the provisions of § 1358 (§,1283, Gen. Stat.
1901) to a corporation of another State doing an interstate
business in Kansas. And the decision of this court in that
case was shortly thereafter followed in the similar case of
InternationalTextbook Co. v. Lynch, 218 U. S.664, brought
here .on error to. the Supreme Court of Vermont. It is
due to the Supreme Court of Kansas to observe that this
court's decision in the Pigg Case had not been made when
that court's decision in the present case was given; but
in'
saying this we would not be understood as implying
that this court announced any new doctrine in the Pigg
Case, for it but reiterated and applied principles which
Were already well recognized, as was shown in the earlier
cases of Paul vi Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 182; Cooper Mfg.
Co. v.Ferguson, 113 U. S.727, 734, and Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S.47, 56.
As accurately reflecting what was held in the Pigg Case,
we excerpt the following from the opinion of the court,
delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan (pp. 109,. 112):
"'To carry on interstate commerce is not a franchise or
a privilege granted by the State; it is a right which every
citizen of the United States is entitled to exercise under
the Constitution and laws of the United States; and the
accession of mere corporate facilities, as a matter of convenience in carrying on their business, cannot have the
effect of depriving them of such right,' unless Congress
should see fit to interpose some contrary regulation on the
subject.'
"How far a corporation of one State is entitled to claim
in another State, where it :is doing business, equality of
,treatment with individual citizens in respect of the right

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.1

226 U. S.

to sue and defend in the courts is a question which the
exigencies of this case do not require to be definitely decided. It is sufficient to say that the requirement of the
Statement mentioned in. § 1283 [§ 1358, Gen. Stat. 19051
of the statute imposes a direct burden on the plaintiff's
right to engage in interstate business, and, therefore, is
in violation of its constitutional rights. It is the established- doctrine of this court that a State may not, in any.
form or under any guise, directly burden the prosecution
of interstate business. But such a burden is imposed when
the corporation of another State, lawfully engaged in
interstate commerc6, is required, as' a condition of its
right to prosecute its business in Kansas, to make and
file a Statement setting forth certain facts which the
State, confessedly, could not control by legislation. It
results that the provision as to the Statement mentioned
in § 1283 [§ 1358, Gen. Stat. 1905] must fall before the
Constitution of the United States, and with it-according
to the established rules of statutory construction-must
fall that part of the same section which provides that the
obtaining of the certificate of the Secretary of State that
such Statement has been properly made shall be a condition precedent to the right of the plaintiff to maintain
an action in the courts of Kansas."
Following the decision in that case, we hold that the
statute upon which the plea in abatement was rested is
unconstitutional and void, and that the plea should not
have been sustained but overruled.
The judgment is reversed as to the remaining plaintiffs
in error, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
