KEATLEY v. FUREY.
226 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

KEATLEY, AS RECEIVER OF AMERICAN GUARANTY COMPANY, v. FUREY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 84. Argued December 12, 19,12.-Decided December 23, 1912.
In order to warrant a direct appeal to this court under § 5 of the Court
of Appeals Act of 1891, the jurisdiction of the Federal court as such
must be involved.
Whether title to the assets outside the State passed to a receiver of a
corporation under an order of the court in the State of organization
depends upon the law of that Stste, and a decision by a Federal court
in another State having custody of assets through a receiver that no
title passed and dismissing a petition of the first named receiver to
intervene, does not involve the question of jurisdiction of the Federal
court and warrant a direct appEal to this court.
In such a case the judge denying the petition to intervene is right in
certifying that no question of jurisdiction exists.
In such a case the Federal court has jurisdiction over the intervention
whether it has jurisdiction as a, Federal court of the principal case
or not; and until final decree in the principal case the question of
jurisdiction is not open.
THE facts, which involve questions of jurisdiction of
the Federal court, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. F. W. Houghton and Mr. W. E. Chilton, with whom
Mr. George B. Edgerton and Mr. Thomas H. Gill were on
the brief, for appellant:
The motion to dismiss should be denied because the
record clearly shows that the sole question decided by the
court below was a single definite question of jurisdiction;
it also clearly appears from the petition for appeal and the
order granting it, that this appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court to review the question of jurisdiction
alone and hence is sufficient without a certificate. Davis

Smith v. McKay, 161 U. S. 355.
The record clearly shows that the sole question decided
by the court below was one of jurisdiction and no certificate is in such case required. Cases supra and United
States v. Larkin, 208 U. S. 333, 338; Chicago v. Mills, 204

Harkraderv. Wadley, 172 U. S. 148.
The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court as a Federal court
was involved in this controversy because no lawful
voluntary general appearance by the defendant was or
could be made therein; and because of the failure to lawfully serve the defendant with any process. Cases supra,

The entire controversy in the court below was whether
or not the decree of dissolution of the American Guaranty
Company of Chicago and the appointment of Receiver
Black of the assets of such corporation within the jurisdiction of such court under the provisions of §§ 57, 58 and
59, Chap. 53, Code of West Virginia, 3d ed., p. 510, so
ended the life and power of such corporation and its officers
that it could not thereafter by. such officers or attorneys
enter a general appearance in the Federal court so as
to give such court jurisdiction in such action. Alderson

Mr. Levy Mayer for appellees:
This appeal should be dismissed because no certificate
of jurisdiction was obtained from the Circuit Court and
no equivalent of a certificate of jurisdiction is shown by
the record. Courtney v. Pradt, 196 U. S. 89; Filhiol v.

The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court as a Federal court
was not involved within the meaning of the act allowing
a direct appeal to this court. The subject-matter was a
controversy as to the possession of the property of a
corporation, between a receiver appointed by the Federal
court and a receiver subsequently appointed by a state
court, and involved the construction of the West Virginia
statutes, and a question of general law. Fore River Ship

The receiver appointed in the West Virginia dissolution proceedings was not a statutory receiver, but was
a mere chancery act receiver, and as such he was not
invested by statute with the title to the property of the
corporation that had been dissolved or made the legal
successor of such corporation.
MR. JusncE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is an appeal from the Circuit Court taken by an
intervenor on the ground that the court never had ob-

tained jurisdiction over the defendant. The petitidn to
intervene was dismissed, the decree declaring that the
court had jurisdiction, that there was no equity in the
petition and that the petitioner was not entitled to any
of the relief prayed for. The court allowed the appeal but
certified that in its opinion no question of jurisdiction
was involved. The appellant contends that the contrary
appears on the face of the record. United States v. Larkin,
208 U. S. 333. The Steamship Jefferson, 215 U. S. 130,
137. Herndon-CarterCo. v. James N. Norris, Son & Co.,
224 U. S. 496.
The material facts are these. On February 1, 1909,
there was filed in a local court of West Virginia a bill for
the dissolution of the American Guaranty Company, a
corporation of that State. The corporation appeared and
consented and on the same day a decree was entered dissolving the corporation, appointing a receiver to whom
Keatley is successor, and directing him to take the steps
necessary to secure possession of the company's property
within the jurisdiction of the court. By the charter of the
company its principal office was to be in Chicago, and in

fact its bank deposits, bonds, &c., were almost wholly
there. On February 2, the suit now before this court
was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of Illinois on the ground that the
West Virginia receiver had no authority outside of his
State, praying for a receiver and the distribution of the
assets collected. There was an appearance and consent
in the name of the corporation, a receiver was appointed
and he proceeded to collect the assets. It is .stated by
the judge -in his opinion that more than 7000 out of the
7030 claims against the company had been presented in
the cause. On October 27, 1909, the West Virginia re.ceiver filed his petition of intervention, setting up that
the corporation, having been dissolved, could not appear
in the suit.

KEATLEY v. FUREY.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Whether the exception to the general rule concerning
jurisdiction of appeals like this established by Shepard v.
Adams, 168 U. S. 618, and Board of Trade v. Hammond
Elevator Co., 198 U. S. 424, applies to the present case,
and what may be the merits of the argument against the
right to appear in the name of the corporation, if the
question is open, cannot be considered until the petitioner's right to present that argument is made out. On
that matter we will assume that, if the petitioner had a
case below, the denial of the right to intervene was not
a discretionary decision and final on that ground. Credits
Commutation Co. v. United States, 177 U. S. 311, 315, 316.
But of course the petitioner's standing in the lower court
depended on his having title, and was not a consequence
of his West Virginia appointment alone unless at least he
got a title by virtue of it, as it was provided by statute in
express terms that the receiver should, in Relfe v. Rundle,
103 U. S.222. See Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris,
198 U. S. 561, 574. The effect of such a provision need
not be considered in this case. In some instances, at least,
it would be enforced outside of the State. Bernheimer v.
Converse, 206 U. S. 516, 534. Converse v. Minnesota
Thresher Manufacturing Co., 212 U. S. 567. Converse v.
Hamilton, 224 U. S.243, 25-7. See Chipman v. Manufacturers' Nat. Bank, 156 Massachusetts, 147, 148, 149. Haskell v. Merrill, 179 Massachusetts, 120, 124. The statute
of West Virginia on the other hand provides for the appointment of receivers to 'take charge of and administer'
the assets, and for the bringing of suit and the conveyance of property in the corporate name thereafter. Code,
ch. 53, §§ 58, 59. It seems, to be sure, that in September and October the local West Virginia court purported
to authorize and confirm a deed by a special commissioner to the .receiver, but if the statute did not itself
constitute the receiver the universal successor of the corporation, see Chipman v. Manufacturers' Nat. Bank, 156

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Syllabus.

226 U. S.

Massachusetts, 147, 148, 149, it may be doubted
whether the deed had extraterritorial effect. See Fall v.
Eastin, 215 U. S. 1. The argument is strong to support
the judgment of the court below that no title passed.
Right or wrong that was the decision of the Circuit
Court, and it is obvious that a dismissal of the petition on
that ground does not warrant a direct appeal, whether
the court had' jurisdiction or not. The court had jurisdiction over the intervention and decided against it on
the merits. That question logically and chronologically
preceded any question of jurisdiction in the principal case.
The question of jurisdictiop in the principal case was not
yet open, as there had been no final decree therein, and
as by virtue of the decision that the intervenor had no
standing, the question could not be raised by him. The
form of the decree really made it impossible for this appeal
to be entertained, but we have discussed the case and
stated the facts more at length in order to explain that the
judge was right in his certificate and could not have acted
otherwise upon his view of the West Virginia law.
Appeal dismissed.

The privilege given telegraph companies under the hict of July 24,
1866, to use military and post roads of the United States for poles
and wire, was permissive and did not create corporate rights and privileges to carry on the business of telegraphy.
The corporate rights and privileges were derived from the laws of the
