Finally, as to the statute's depriving the plaintiff in
error of its liberty because it forbids a certain class of
dealings, we think it enough to say that as the law does.
not otherwise encounter the Fourteenth Amendment, it
is not to be disturbed on this ground. The matter has
been discussed so often in this court that we simply refer
to Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire,

ICE COM-

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY oF
NEW MEXICO.
No. 55.

Argued November 14, 15, 1912.-Decided December 2, 1912.

A master may remain liable for a certain time for a failure to use reasonable care in furnishing a safe 'place for the servant to work, notwithstanding the servant's appreciation of the danger, if he induces
the servant to keep on by a promise to remove the source of danger.
Even if it is open, it will require a strong case to induce the appellate
court to review the discretion of the trial couirt in allowing leading
questions; in this case, the witness being a foreigner who seemingly
did not understand the English language, there is no ground for
revision.
This court will not go behind the decision of the Supreme Court of a
Territory upon a matter of loca, practice in order to reverse the
judgment upon a technicality and an assumption contrary to a fact
appearing in the record.

Argument for :Plaintiff in Error.

In this case the trial court appears to have properly instructed the jury
in regard to damages to which the plaintiff was entitled for personal
injury, and did not as to future pain, etc., go beyond conservative
rules laid down in such cases.
The court may, within conservative rules, instruct the jury that they
may, in estimating the damages of a plaintiff in a personal injury
suit, consider loss of time with reference to ability to earn money,
temporary or permanent impairment of capacity to earn money,
disfigurement and pain, past or reasonably certain to be suffered in
the future. See Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Lindeman,
143 Fed. Rep. 946.
Where the charge directs that the jury deduct from damages amounts
paid under a release executed by plaintiff, if the jury set the release
aside it is immaterial what the amounts so paid represented as 'the
transaction was r~scinded by the verdict.
15 N. Mex. 232, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a verdict for
personal injuries, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Francis E. Wood, with whom Mr. 0. N. Marron
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The trial court erred in refusing to grant defefidants'
motion for judgment in its favor on the special findings of
the jury.
This is an action for negligence, not on contract. To
maintain it, the first step must be to establish some
breach of duty, some actionable negligence on the part
of the appellant.
The general verdict for plaintiff is inconsistent with the
special finding, and the special finding must prevail.
Sec. 2993, Comp. Laws of New Mexico of 1897. This
section was examined and approved in Walker v. Southern
Pacific Ry. Co., 165 U. S. 593.
The law imposed on the defendant in this case only the
obligation to use reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in keeping the cooker in a reasonably safe condition
for use. It did not make him an insurer of the condition

of the cooker or of the safety of the plaintiff. 20 A. &
E. Enc. 74; Shearman & Redf. on Negligence, § 189, 4th

Labatt on Master and Servant, § 110; see also Moore
v. Wabash Ry. Co., 85 Missouri, 588; Bailey v. R. W. &
0. Ry., 139 N. Y. 302.
Plaintiff was entirely familiar with the cooker. He had
had charge of it and used it for a year. He understood
and appreciated the risk, as well as an ordinarily prudent
man could do. He knew the kettle was cracked and leaking in May, 1905, at least seven months before the
injury.
The jury having expressly found that it was not so
defective that a reasonably prudent man would not have
used it, the defendant is not legally liable for damages resulting from its use.
To require a greater measure of care than this of the
defendant was to require a greater amount than the law
imposes upon him.
A promise to- change conditions, the existence
of which
is not negligence, gives no right of action if injury results
from such condition while the promise remains unfulfilled.
Sweeney v. Jones Elevator Co., 101 N. Y. 520; Shearman &
Redf. on Negligence, § 186.
It is the original negligence of the defendant that is the
base of the cause of action and not the promise to repair.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

It was reversible error to allow leading questions to be
put to the plaintiff to elicit evidence that he was induced
to use the cooker by the promise to repair it and would
not have used it otherwise. Lewis v. N.' Y. &c. R. Co.;
153 Massachusetts, 73; S. P. Co. v. Leash, 2 Tex. Civ.
App. 68; Brewer v. T. C. I. & R. 'Co., 97 Tennessee, 615;
Harris v. Bottum, 81 Vermont, 346; Hollis v. Widner, 221
Pa. St. 72; Halloranv. U. L. & T. Co., 133 Missouri, 420;
Wigmore on Evidence, § 357.
There was no credible evidence sufficient to, sustain a
verdict that the plaintiff continued to use the cooker because of the promise of repair.
It was error for the trial court to refuse to charge that
the burden was on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of evidence that he was incompetent to make
a binding contract at the time the release was executed.
Weakness of understanding is not, of itself, any objection in law to the validity of a contract. If a man be
legally compos mentis, he is the disposer of his own property. Jones v. Jones, 137 N. Y. 610, 613; Taylor v. Butterick, 165 Massachusetts, 547; Wyatt. v. Walker, 44
Illinois, 485; Artrip v. Raza'ke, 96 Virginia, 277, and see
a note collecting the cases upon this point, 36 L. R. A.
731.
The court erred in its instruction to the jury, on the
measure of damages and in refusing the defendant's
requested instruction upon that subject.
Under the instruction as given the jury were permitted
to give speculative damages for some assumed impaired
earning capacity from the time of the injury down to the
time of the trial.
The measure of damages for loss of earning capacity is
the difference between what was earned before the injury
and what he would be able to earn thereafter, Braithwait
v. Hall, 168 Massachusetts, 38, and the injured party is

required to use all reasonable efforts to reduce the damages. 4 Suth. Dam., § i255.
If the party has received compensation or wages between the time of the injury and the trial he can recover
nothing for loss of such wages. Drinkwater v. Dinsmore,
80 N. Y. 390; Montgomery v. Mallett, 92 Alabama,
209.
In this case the plaintiff had been fully compensated for
loss of wages or earnings and all other expenses incident
to his injury, and he was only entitled to recover as past
damages, compensation for pain and suffering. Wherever
the plaintiff has been able to earn as much since as before
the injury, the jury should not consider the item of impairment of earning capacity. 8 A. & E. Enc. 654; Kane
v. Rd. Co., 95 Georgia, 858; M. C. R. Co. v. Mitten, 13
Tex. Civ. App. 653; Drinkwater v. Dinsmore, supra.
The court erred in instructing the jury to consider
future pain and anguish in assessing damages. Shultz v.
Griffith, 103 Iowa, 150. See also Illinois Iron Co. v.
Helner, 196 Illinois, 526; Carter v. Nunda, 66 N. Y. Supp.
1059; 6 Thomp; on Negligence, 2794.
Mr. Neill B. Field for defendant in error:
The special findings are harmonious with each other
and with the general verdict.
The master is liable, during the running of his promise
to repair a known defect, in all cases unless the servant,
either by continuing the service an unreasonable length of
time or by the use of the appliance when in an imminently
dangerous condition has by his own conduct released the
master. Hough v. R. R. Co., 100 U. S. 213; R. R. Co. V.

973; Detroit Crude Oil Co. v. Grable, 94 Fed. Rep. 73;

The trial court correctly charged the jury with reference
to the burden of proof, but if the charge'were silent as to
this, such silence would be wholly imma erial. '

procedure, this 'court habitually follows, the 10al court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delvered the opinion of the court.
This is an action by a servant for personal injuries..'
The declaration alleged that it was the plaintiff's duty to
cook brewer's mash in a cooker, that the cooker .was so
out of repair that the plaintiff was unwilling to use it, but
that the defendant requested him to go on until it could
be repaired and 'promised that it should be Within a very

short time; that the plaintiff did go on, relying upon the
promise, that the cooker gave way and the plaintiff was
badly scalded. The defendant denied the allegations and
pleaded plaintiff's contributory negligence and a release.
In a replication the plaintiff denied his mental capacity
at the time the release was made. There was a verdict fQr
the plaintiff subject to special findings which by the law
of New Mexico control, Walker v. New Mexico & Southern
PacificR. R. Co., 165 U. S. 593, and the defendant alleged
exceptions. These were overruled by the Supreme Court
of the Territory and the judgment affirmed.
The first point argued. is that the defendant was entitled
to judgment on the special findings, because the fourth
was that the cooker at the time was not ir such a bad
condition that a man of ordinary prudence would not have
used the same. But the eleventh was that the defendant
did not use ordinary care in furnishing the cooker and in
having it repaired, and the sixth, that the defendant
promised the plaintiff that the cooker should be repaired
as an inducement for him to continue using it. So it is
evident that the fourth finding meant only that the plaintiff was not negligent in remaining at work. Whatever
the difficulties may be with the theory of the exception,
1 Labatt, Master and Servant, ch. 22, § 423, it is the well
settled law that for a certain time a master may remain
liable for a failure to use reasonable care in furnishing a
safe place in which to work, notwithstanding the servant's
appreciation of the danger, if he induces the servant to
keep on by a promise that the source of trouble shall be
removed. Hough v. Texas & Pacific R. R. Co., 100 U. S.
213.
Next it is argued that the judgment should be set aside
because the court allowed somewhat leading questions to
be asked to bring out the plaintiff's reliance upon the defendant's promise. If this matter is open it is enough to
say that the plaintiff is a German and seemingly did not

Opinion of the Court.

understand the questions put to him very well, and that
it would require a very much stronger case than this to
induce an appellate court to revise the discretion of the
trial court and grant a new trial upon such a ground.
Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Urlin, 158 U. S. 271, 273.
The next point, that there was no credible evidence to
sustain the verdict, so far as it does not -rest on the preceding one, was for the jury, not for this court.
Fourthly it is argued that the court erred in refusing to
instruct the jury that the burden was on the plaintiff to
prove his incompetence at the time of making the release.
It seems from the record that an instruction to that effect
was given but that it was omitted from the bill of exceptions. The Supreme Court of the Territory took notice
of the fact, and we certainly should not go behind their
decision upon a matter of local practice in order to reverse'
a judgment upon a technicality and an assumption contrary to the fact. Santa Fe County v. Coler, 215 U. S. 296.
Finally it is said that the instructions as to the measure
of damages were wrong. The court instructed the jury
that they might consider the plaintiff's, loss of time with
reference to his ability to earn money, the impairment of
his capacity to earn money, whether temporary or permanent, disfigurement, and pain, past or reasonably certain to be suffered in the future-and that they should
deduct from the amount, if any, the disbursements made
under the release which the finding of the jury set aside.
It is objected that a part of the disbursements were wages
during the plaintiff's disability, but it did not matter
whether they were or not if the transaction was rescinded.
With regard to future pain &c. the judge did not go beyond the conservative rule laid down in such cases as
Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v.-Lindeman, 143 Fed. Rep.
946, 950. The rest of the argument is a discussion of
evidence with which we have nothing to do.
Judgment affirmed.
