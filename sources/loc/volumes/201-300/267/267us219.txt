MR.CHImF JusTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the
Court.
is case turns on substantially the same questions as
those just decided in Pennsylvania Federation No. 90
against the same defendant, ante, p. 203. It is a bill in
equity by a trade union called The Pennsylvania System
Board of Adjustment of the Brotherhood of Railway and
Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station
Employees, made up of several classes of employees,
clerical and otherwise, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, seeking to enjoin the Company from maintaining the same
kind of alleged conspiracy as that described and complained of by Federation No. 90 in the previous case.
There is no prayer in the bill in this case for damages as
there was in the other, but the circumstances and the law
sought to be applied to them are in every respect similar.
As in the previous case, elaborate briefs were filed to
justify the contention that. Title III of. the Transportation Act vested the employees of the Pennsylvania Road
with definite rights, the violation of which constituted a

legal wrong and that on these a charge of conspiracy could
be predicated, and a remedy by injunction might be had
in behalf of the complainants. For the same reasons as
those stated in the previous case, the same conclusion
must be reached. The Circuit Court of Appeals and the
District Court were therefore right in dismissing the bill.
The decree is
Affirmed.

ON CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 47. Argued October 8, 1924.-Decided March 2, 1925.
Section 10 of the Immigration Act, 1917, makes it the duty of any
person, -including owners, officers and agents of vessels, bringing in
an alien, to prevent his landing at a time or place other than as
designated by the immigration officers, and punishes failure to
comply by a fine in each- case of not less than $200 nor more than

$1,000, or by imprisonment, or both, but provides that if in the
opinion of the Secretary of Labor it is impracticable or inconvenient
to prosecute such person,. owner, etc., "a penalty of $1,000 shall
be a lien upon the vessel whose owner, master, officer, or agent
violates the provisions of this section, and such vessel shall be libeled
therefor in the appropriate United States court."
Held, that where a vessel is so libeled, the penalty is $1,000, neither
more nor less, for each alien landing from it in violation of the
section. P. 221.
