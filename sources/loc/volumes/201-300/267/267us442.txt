BARCLAY & COMPANY, INCORPORATED v. EDWARDS, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE
FOR THE SECOND DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 547. Argued November 24, 1924.-Decided Dec. 15, 1924.
1. The taxation by Congress of the income of domestic corporations
derived from sale abroad of goods bought or made by them in
this countryr is not a tax on exports; nor does it violate due
process of law because a like tax is not imposed on the income
similarly derived by foreign corporations. National ]Paper Co. v.
Bowers, 266 U. S. 373. P. 447.
2. The exemption of foreign corporations is equally valid whether
complete or only partial. Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 considered. P. 448.
3. The power of Congress in laying taxes is very wide; and the
Fifth Amendment does not- apply to discrimination between taxpayers based on a classification that is not arbitrary and capricious, but reasonable. P. 450. ERROR to a judgment of the District Court dismissing
an action to recover money paid under protest as a federal income tax. The case here (547) was first decided
on December 15, 1924, upon authority of National Paper
& Type Co. v. Bowers, No. 320, decided on the same
day and reported in 266 U. S.373. Due to a motion for
rehearing, the opinion was withheld from publication.
It is now printed, following the opinion overruling the
motion.

and Mr. Homer Sullivan were on the briefs, for plaintiff in

Howe, 5 B. T. C. 198; Gderz v. Bell, 2 K. B. 136; Corpus
Juris, Vol. 14A, § 3945. Congress recognizes that foreign
corporations transacting business within the United
States, are resident in the United States, by referring in
par. 1 of § 217 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat.
c. 136). to such, foreign corporations as "resident foreign
corporations."
Treaty rights have been granted under which foreign
corporations carry on business in the United. States.
Income from the business of manufacturing goods in
one jurisdiction and selling them in another is taxable at
the place of manufacture, Underwood Typewriter Co. v.
Chamberlain,254 U. S. 113' Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S.
37. The income of foreign corporations, from goods
manufactured by them within the United States and
exported and disposed of or sold in foreign countries, was
earned within the United States.
It is clearly established that discrimination in taxati6n
which is' made to depend on nationality or allegiance,
is arbitrary, oppressive or apricious, and hence in violation of the "due process of law" .provision of the
Fifth Amendment: See Cooley on Taxation, (3d & 4th
eds. p. 23); Cooley's Const. Limit's. pp. 707, 708 and
723; Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114; Am. Sugar

U. S. 1. It is submitted that it would be impossible to
draft a law taxing income which would be more "wanting in basis for classification" or wherein any more
"gross and patent inequality" in taxation would result

than that which is complained of here. Compared with
the competing foreign corporations the occupation is the
same; the circumstances and conditions under which this
competition is carried on are identical; and hence it
would be impossible to discriminate against the plaintiff
in error in this case without basing the classification on
nationality or allegiance, or something equally arbitrary
and capricious, which is precisely what this Court has
said Congress cannot do without thereby takin7 property
.contrary to due process of law. The fundamental principle is equality in application of the law.. Truax v. Corrigan, 267 U. S. 334; Hurtado v. People of California,
110 U. S. 516; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466;- Hayes v.
Missburi, 120 U. S. 68.
The due process of law principle applies to income
taxes with respect to a situation like that of the plaintiff
in error. Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, 54, holds in
effect that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment restricts Congress to the condition that taxes on
income derived from the business of manufacturing for
export and exporting, in order to be valid, must be imposed equally on all persons under like circumstances and
c6nditions. That the tax discrimination against plaintiff
in error violates due process of law, see Raymond v. Chic.
Union Tract. Co. 207 U. S. 20; Truax v. Raich 239 U. S.
33. It cannot be seriously suggested that a discrimination which violates this clause when it is directed against
the alien does not violate the clause when directed against
the citizen. To so contend would be equivalent to asserting that. Congress has power to force American citizens
to expatriate themselves in order to "obtain support in
the ordinary fields of labor" or to protect their property
in the United States from injury' or confiscation. See
Slaughter House Cases, 111 U. S. 746, 757; Soon Hing v.
Crowley, 113 U. S. 703, 709; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery
Co. 260 U. S. 245, 255; Sou. Ry. Co. v. Greene, 216 U. S.

Western Union Tel. Co. v. Frear,216 Fed. 199, 202.
Peck v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165, declared that the status
of the net income from exporting and selling abroad " is
not different from that' of the exported articles prior to
the exportation". It is evident that if such- net income
did not have this status; it would necessarily be related
to the activities of exporting, and hence to tax it would
be, in violation of par. 5, of § 9 of Article I of the Constitution. That a tax on such net income, irrespective
of whether the goods are sold within or without the State,
is like a tax on property, in the State, is held by this
Court in United States Glue Ca. v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S.
321, and in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain,
supra; and is confirmed in Shaffer v. Carter, supra.
Hence, if Congress is not restrained by the "due process
of law" clause of the Fifth Amendment from making the
discrimination in favor of foreign corporations which is
here complained of Congress would not be restrained
from making a discrimination exempting foreign, corporations from thd payment of customs duties on articles
imported into the United States while imposing 'such
duties on American corporations; or from making a discrimination exempting foreign corporations .frofa the
taxes paid by manufacturers, producers, and importers
on domestic sales, while imposing such.taxes on gales by
American corporations; or from making a discrimination
exempting foreign corporations in the business of insurance, or banking, or building, or any other business in
the United Stites, from income or profits tax, or capital
stock tax, or any other sort of tax which Congress can
impose, while levying such tax upon American 'corporations engaged in like business.
The tax constituted a direct burden on and impediment
to plaintiff in error's business of exporting, in violation of
par. 5 of § 9 of Article I of the Constitution. Peck v.

It is to be noted that the law under which the tax was
assessed, known as the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat.
c. 18) provided in § 213 (c) that nonresident alien individuals should have the same exemption that was granted
to foreign corporations by § 233 (b) of that act with
respect to income derived from the business of exporting carried on in the United1 States. It is well known in
commercial circles that there are many firms or partnerships engaged in the exporting business in the United
States which are composed of alien individuals, of whom
nearly all are nonresident aliens.
Mr. Solicitor General Beck, with whom Mr. Nelson T.
Hartson and Mr. Robert P. Reeder were on the brief, for
defendant in error.
MR. CHIEMF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the
Court.
On December 15, 1924, Mr. Justice McKenna delivered
the opinion of this Court in the case of the National
Paper and Type Company against Frank K. Bowers,
Collector, [266 U. S. 373] No. 320 of the present Term.
That case was heard at the same time with this. They
were suits to recover taxes which it was claimed had been
illegally collected for the reason that the statutes under
which they had been exacted deprived the taxpayers of
their property without due process of law. The statute
attacked in No. 320 was the income tax of 1921, that in
this case was the income tax of 1918.
The plaintiffs in the two cases were corporations of
this country engaged in the business of the purchase and
manufacture of personal property within the United
States, and the sale thereof without the United

Opinion of the Court.

States. Their objection to the taxes, both of 1921 and of
1918, was that they were subjected to a tax on all of
their net income, including profits made by them in the
sale of their goods abroad, while foreign corporat-i6ns,
engaged in the same business of buying and manufacturing goods in this country and selling them abroad, were
not taxed upon their whole net income but were exempted
from a tax on all or a part of it.
Another objection to the tax'was that the tax in both
instances was a tax on exports. That was disposed of
by this .Court in opinion No. 320 by reference to the case
of Peck & Company v. Lowe, 247 U. S.165.
The Court further pointed out that, in respect to what
was called discrimination in favor of foreign corporations,
Congress might adopt a policy calculated to serve the
best interests of this country in dealing with citizens or
subjects of another country and might properly say, as
to earnings from business begun in one country and ending in another, that the net income of foreign subjects
or citizens should be left to the taxation of their own
government or t6 that having jurisdiction of the sales;
that the question of taxing foreign corporations on such
income might properly be affected by the consideration
that domestic corporations had the power of the United
States to protect their interests and redress their wrongs
in whatever part of the world their business might take
them, while the foreign corporations must"look to the
country of their origin for protection against injury or redress of losses occurring in countries other 'than the
United States. 'Having disposed of No. 320 for these
reasons in favor of the Government, by affirming the.
judgment below, a short opinion was delivered by Mr.
Justice McKenna in No. 547, in- which he said that the
charge of invalidity in that case was on the same grounds
as those set up in No. 320; and fhat, upon authority of
the decision in No. 320, the judgment should be affirmed.

448

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

267 U. S.

A petition for rehearing seeks now to differentiate the
.present case from that considered and decided in No. 320.
. The Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1076, provided for
a tax of 12 per cent. on the net income in excess of certain
credits upon domestic corporations, but contained this
provision in case of foreign corporations, under § 233 (b):
"In the case of a foreign corporation gross income includes only the gross income from sources within the
United States, including the interest on bonds, notes, or
other ihterest-bearing obligations of residents, corporate
or otherwise, dividends from resident corporations, and
including all amounts received (although paid under a
contract for the sale of goods or otherwise) representing
profits on the manufacture and disposition of goods within
the United States." (40 Stat. 1077.)
* The Revenue Act of 1921 taxed the net income (meaning the gross income, less certain deductions) of domestic
corporations. 42 Stat. 252, 254. The same section, No.
232, provided that "In the cage of a foreign corporation,
the computation should be made in the manner provided
in § 217. The relevant parts of §§ .217 and 233 were as
follows:
"Sec. 217 (a). That in the case of a non-resident alien
individual or of a citizen entitled to the benefits of section 262.
"(e) Items of gross income, expenses, losses and deductions, other than those.specified in subdivisions (a)
and (c), shall be allocated or apportioned to sources
within or without the United States under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval
of the Secretary. . . . Gains, profits and income from
(1) transportation or other services rendered partly within
and partly without the United States, or (2) from. the
sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part)
by the taxpayer within and. sold without, the United
States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer

Opinion of the Court.

without and sold within, the United States, shall be
treated as derived partly-from sources within and partly
from sources without the United States. Gains, profits
and income derived from the purchase of personal property within and its sale without the United States or
from the purchase of personal property without and its
sale within the United States, shall be treated as derived
entirely from the country in which sold.

.

(42

Stat. 243, 244, 245.)
"See. 233.
"(b) In the case of a foreign corporation, gross income
means only gross income from sources within the United
States, determined (except in case of insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 243 or 246)
in the manner provided in section 217." (42 Stat. 254.)
Counsel contend in their petition for rehearing that the
:Revenue Act of 1921 provided, with respect to the manufacture within the United States by foreign corporations
of goods which they sold in foreign countries, that the income derived should be allocated to sources within'the
United States, and imposed a tax on that part 'of such
income allocated to manufacture j whereas the Revenue
Act of 1918, under whicl this case arose, exempted from
tax all income of foreign corporations derived from the
manufacture or purchase of goods within the United
States which they sold or disposed of in foreign countries.
But we do not think that that distinction makes any'difference in the application of the principle upon which the
judgment in No. 320 was based. Whatever .the difference
between the acts, whether the foreign corporations were
wholly exempted or only partially exempted, they constituted a class all by themselves and could be properly so.
treated by Congress because of the considerations sug-.
gested in the opinion in.
No. 320. The attack made upon
the law of 1921 for discrimination against American corporations in favor of foreign corporations was quite as

267 U. S.

vigorous in the briefs of counsel for the plaintiffs in error
in No. 320 as in No. 547, and rested on the same argument; and while the exemption of the net income of
foreign corporations from manufacture in United States
did not exist in the Act of 1921 as in the Act of 1918, the
question of discrimination in the two cases only differed
in extent and did not call for any real distinction in deciding them. The question where an income is earned is
always a matter of doubt when the business is begun in
one country and ended in another. As pointed out by
the plaintiff in error in his brief in No. 320, much of the
business in such foreign trade in addition to the manufacture is done in the United States in storehouses and
docks and in other ways after the manufacture, but whatever of that might be equitably allocated as done in the
United States is exempted from taxation of foreign corporations by the Act of 1921. Thus exactly the same
question presents itself as in No. 320. It is only a difference in degree.
The power of Congress in levying taxes is very wide,
and where a classification is made of taxpayers that is
reasonable, and not merely arbitrary and capricious, the
Fifth Amendment can not apply. As this Court said,
speaking of. the taxing power of Congress, in Evans v.
Gore, 253 U. S. 245, 256: "It may be applied to every
object within its range' in such measure as Congress may
determine'; enables that body 'to select one calling and
omit another, to tax one class of property and to forbear to
tax another'; and may be applied in different ways to
different objects so long as there is 'geographical uniformity' in the duties, imposts hnd excises imposed. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 443; Austin v. The Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, 699; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533,
541, 548; Kn'owlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 92, 106; Treat

Brushaberv. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 24-26."
The power of Congress to make a difference between
the tax on foreign corporations and that on domestic corporations is not measured by the same rule as that for
determining whether taxes imposed by one State upon
the profits of a manufacturing corporation are an imposition of tax upon a subject matter not within the jurisdiction of the taxing State. Cases -on that subject like
Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 254 U. S.
113, have no application to the question here. Considerations of policy toward foreign countries may veiny well
justify an exemption of the foreign corporations from
taxes that might legitimately be imposed on them, but
which Congress does not think it wise to exact. Such
considerations justify a different classification of foreign
corporations doing business in the United States, either'
of manufacture or of purchase, and making profit out of
that business in other countries, from that which would
apply to its own corporations. The injustice thought to
be worked upon domestic corporations engaged in sales
abroad, by a different classification, for purposes of taxation, of foreign corporations similarly engaged, is an argument not for the constitutional invalidity of the law before a court, but for its repeal before Congress.
The opinion of Mr. Justice McKenna applying the
same principles in this case to those- applied in No. 320
was entirely justified, and the petition for. rehearing is
Overruled.
The original opinion is as follows:
MR. JUsTIcE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The plaintiff in' error is a domestic corporation engaged in business as a, manufacturer. It is subjected -to
