of the order of January 19, 1925 [ante, p. 9], the receiver
is instructed to pay to such company $2.904.13 out of the
net proceeds derived from well 139-such payment to be

reason of the work done and expenses incurred by such

whose whereabouts are not known and who have not applied for them although warned to do so by due 'public
notice, it is ordered that so much of such proceeds as remain thus unclaimed on 'April 15, 1925, be paid over to
the State of Texas to the end that that State may take
such action concerning the same as may be appropriate
in respect of unclaimed property within the State. In
making this payment the receiver is instructed to specify
the well from which each fund was derived and otherwise
to identify it as nearly as may be practicable.
The receiver is instructed to pay over to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United
States, within ten days after the date of this order
$1,100,000.00 out of the remaining net impounded funds

additions to such funds.
The receiver is instructed to contin e the disbursement of the funds in his custody according to the instructions and orders heretofore given, and otherwise to prepare for closing up the receiversbip during the present
term of this court.
