MODERN WOODMEN OF AMERICA v. JENNIE V.
MIXER.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA.
No. 308. Submitted March 18, 1925.-Decided April 13, 1925.
1. Becoming a member of an incorporated beneficiary society is more
than a contract; it is entering into a complex and abiding relation;
and the rights of membership are to be governed by the. law of
P. 551.
the State of the society's incorporation.
2. Hence other States, irrespective of where the certificate of membership was issued, cannot attach to a membership rights against
the society which are refused by the law of the domicil. Id.
3. Where a by-law of such a corporation provided that absence of
any member unheard of should not give any right to recover on
any benefit certificate until the member's expectancy of life had
expired, and this was upheld by the Supreme Court of its domiciliary State even as against memberships antedating the by-law,
held that a decision of a court of another State denying it this
effect failed to give full faith and credit to the domiciliary charter.

CEaTioR.aI to a judgment of the Supreme Court of the
State of Nebraska which affirmed a judgment for the
plaintiff (here respondent) in an action on a benefit
certificate.

Mr. Nelson C. Pratt, with whom Messrs. Truman
Plantz, Frank M. McDavid, George G. Perrin, and
George H. Davis were on the briefs, for petitioner.
The question whether payment of assessments shall
cease at the expiration of seven years' unexplained absence of the member or shall eontinue to be paid for the
period of the expectancy of life of the member is one
which affects the financial interest of every member of
the society. Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S. 531;

Argument for Petitioner.

When the petitioner came into Nebraska it brought its
charter with it, and its power to do any given thing is
to be determined by that charter and the interpretation
of it by the courts of Illinois. The Nebraska courts
failed to give full faith and credit to the decision and
judgment of the court of Illinois in the case of Steen v.
Modern Woodmen, 296 Ill. 104.
Where either the application or the benefit certificate
contains an agreement on behalf of the member to be
bound by after-enacted by-laws, after-enacted by-laws
are valid and the member is bound thereby.
The application made by the member and the benefit
certificate provide that the laws, rules and usages of the
society then in force, or which might thereafter be enacted, are part of the contract between the member and
the society. The contract, therefore, provided that the
member should be bound by all the laws that were
legally enacted by the petitioner subsequent to the time
of the issuance of his benefit certificate. Hall v. Association, 69 Neb. 601; Funk v. Stevens, 102 Neb. 681;

The contract sued upon was delivered and first became
effective in the State 6f South Dakota. There is neither
pleading nor proof as to the laws of that. State. The law
of South Dakota is therefore presumed to be the same as

member thereof, and providedjin his application that no
right should accrue to him until he had been adopted
and made the payments required at adoption, and that
the certificate should only be delivered to him after
adoption, all in accordance with the by-laws of the society; and the endorsement upon the certificate shows,
that this is what was done, and that when he was adopted
into the local camp the certificate was delivered to him
and he accepted it and paid the dues and charges required. So that all of the acts which made the certificate
a contract took place in South Dakota, and not in the
State of Illinois. the appellant acting by and through its
local camp and the officers thereof as its agents, and the
insured acting for himself. It is therefore quite immaterial that the Constitution of the United States provides
that full faith and credit must be given to certain records
and acts of each State when they become important in
some other State.
The general rule is that the construction of a contract
of insurance and the rights and obligations of the parties
thereto must be determined by the -law of the place
where the contract is made. Equitable Life Assurance

Opinion of the Court.

267 U. S.

MR. JusTIcE HoLmES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit by the beneficiary of a certificate issued
by a fraternal beneficiary society incorporated in Illinois.
The member to whom the certificate was issued was the
plaintiff's husband and the ground of recovery is that the
husband had disappeared and had not been heard of for
ten years before this suit was brought. His 'expectancy
of life according to the tables had not expired and the defence is a by-law of the Corporation to the effect that
"long continued absence of any member unheard of shall
not . . . give any right to recover on any benefit
certificate . . . until the full term of the member's
expectancy of life, according to the National Fraternal
Congress Table of Mortality, has expired, . . . and
this law shall be in full force and effect any statute of any
state or country or rule of common law of any state or
country to the contrary notwithstanding."
'The only-facts thai need be mentioned are that the certificate seems to have been issued in South Dakota, although there was no allegation or proof concerning the
law of that State, and that it was issued in 1901, while
the by-law relied upon was not adopted until 1908. But
the by-law has been held valid and binding -upon the
members of the Corporation by the Supreme Court of
Illinois, although they had become members before the
change. Steen v. Modern Woodmen of America, 296 Ill.
104.. The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed a judgment for the plaintiff, seemingly, from the cases cited, on
the ground either *that the rule of evidence must be determined by the lex fori, or, more probably, that the bylaw was unreasonable. 197 N. W. 129. The result is
that if the validity of the by-law ought to be determined
by the laws of Illinois, the plaintiff is allowed to recover
upon a state'of facts which the contract expressly stipu-

Opinion of thc Court.

lates shall not give her that right. A writ of certiorari
was issued by this Court. 265 U. S. 576.
'The indivisible unity between the members of a corporation of this kind in respect of the fund from which
their rights are to be enforced and the consequence that
their rights must be determined by a single law, is elaborated in Supreme, Council of the Royal Arcanum v.
Green, 237 U. S. 531, 542. The ict of becoming a member is something more than a contract, it is entering into a
complex and abiding relation, and as marriage looks to
domicil, membership looks to and must be governed by
the law of the State granting the incorporation. We need
not consider what other States may refuse to do, but we
deem it established that they cannot attach to membership rights against the Company that are refused by the
law of the domicil. It does not matter that the member
joined in another State. In the abovecited case Green
became a member of a Massachusetts corporation in New
-York, and the State Court held on ordinary principles of
contract that his rights were governed by New York law.
Green v. Royal Arcanum, 206 N. Y. 591, 597. But the
decision was reversed and it was held a failure to give full
faith and credit to the Massachusetts charter as construed
by the Massachusetts Court that Green was relieved by
decree from paying assessments increased by the corporation after his contract was made. We are of opinion that
the decision in that case governs this, and that the judgment must be reversed.
Judgment reversed.
