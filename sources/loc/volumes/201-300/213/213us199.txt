Argued March 16, 17, 1909.-Decided April 5, 1909.

Where there is nothing in the record on which to base them this court
cannot indulge in preiumptions as to which of several possible forms
a transaction may have taken.
Where goods are exempt from the taxing power of the State under the
Constitution of the United States because.not within the State, the
protection of the Constitution extends to warehouse receipts for those
goods locally pretent within the State; and this rule applied to whiskey in a foreign country, warehouse receipts for which were held by
a person in Kentucky and sought to be taxed as personal property
at owner's domicil.
A tax upon warehouse receipts for goods amounts in substance and
effect to a tax upon the goods themselves. Fairbankv. United States,
181 U. S. 283.

The facts are stated in 'the opinion.
Mr. Alexander Pope Humphrey and Mr. John L. Dodd, with
whom Mr. Joseph C. Dodd was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The tax in question violates ยง 10, Art. I, of the C;1stitution
of the United States prohibiting a State from laying any tax
upon exports. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; The
