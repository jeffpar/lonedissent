DETROIT STEEL COOPERAGE COMPANY v. SISTERSVILLE BREWING COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO"THE CIRCUIT COURT. OF APPEALS FOR THE

FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No: 368.

Argued May 8, 1914.-Decided May 25, 1914.

The common law knows no objection to what is commonly called a
conditional sale.
Chattels, such. as tanks, furnished for a brewery under a contract of
conditional sale duly recorded, although indispensable as part of the
completed structure and attached to the real estate as between the
mortgagor and the mortgagee, are not so attached to the realty as
to become a part thereof and subject to the lien of a prior mortgage
as between the vendor of the tanks and the mortgagee, if, as in this
case, they can be removed without the physical disintegration of the
building. Holt v. Henley, 232 U. S. 637.
An owner of a chattel may lose title thereto without his consent by its
incorporation into a structure in such manner that its removal would
destroy the structure.
The mere knowledge that a chattel,. delivered under a contract of conditional sale, will be attached to the freehold, is of no importance,
except as against innocent purchasers for value before the sale is
recorded.

any circumstances, regardless of the question whether the
removal would injure the structure or not; and whether
they can be removed or not without injury to the building
is not determinative of the issues in this case. Lazear v.
Foundry Co., 65 W. Va. 105; Moore v. Patton, 16 W. Va.
428; McFadden v. Crawford, 36 W. Va. 671.
The tanks being necessary for the purposes for which
they were to be used, must be regarded as part of the
realty, and not liable to be levied upon as personalty and
not liable to be removed. In this case the said tanks were
actually placed in the building and the opening through
which they had been carried was fully walled up; and the
tanks installed as an integral part of the brewery, and
without which there could have been no brewery. Moore

Rep. 529.
The Massachusetts rule is prevalent and recognized as
the law, as has been before suggested, in the jurisdiction
from which this litigation arose. The courts in Massachusetts make a clear distinction between that which is
to remain in the form of goods and chattels, and that
which becomes a part of the real estate, without regard
to the fact of whether it is physically annexed or attached
to the real estate or whether it is held in place by gravity.
Iunt v, Iron Co., 97 Massachusetts, 279.
There is a plain and marked distinction made between
the Massachusetts line of decisions and the line of decisions
headed by the New York Court of Appeals, and see Porter

Having sold ard delivered the tanks to the Brewing
Company to be attached to the real estate on which the
trust mortgage given to secure the bonds was a first lien,
and having permitted the tanks to enter into and become
a material part of the brewery plant, the Steel Company is
estopped from asserting any right or priority on the property or the proceeds derived from the sale thereof to the
injury of the security of the bondholders, but must be regarded as having waived its rights, if any, as against defendants' prior lien. Phoenix Iron Works v. N. Y. Security
Co., 83 Fed. Rep. 757; Evans v. Kister, 92 Fed. Rep. 836.
The rights of the mortgagee cannot be affected by any
agreement, to which he is not a party, made between the
seller and the mortgagor in possession. The rights of the
mortgagee are superior to those of the seller of the fixtures
attempting to retain title. Tippett v. Barham, 180 Fed.
Rep. 76.
Under the "Massachusetts Rule," as distinct from the
"New York Rule," and which is the rule of the two Virginias, and of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the
rights of the mortgagee cannot be affected by an agreement to which he is not a party, and such rights are superior to those of the seller of the .fixtures retaining title.

or the reservation of a lien thereon is-held to be ineffectual
to preserve the rights of the seller. United States v. New

28 C. C. A. 76; Meagher v. Hayes, 152 Massachusetts, 228.
The mortgagees in obtaining the bonds contemplated
the future acquisition of tanks from some source. The
Cooperage Company, when it furnished the tanks, contemplated that they were putting into the plant something that, would make it a complete brewery, and an
integral part thereof. Tippett v. Barham, supra.

difficulty in removing the machinery involved in those
cases. See In re Williamsburg Knitting Mill, 190 Fed.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill in equity for an injunction against the sale
of certain tanks, fixtures and fittings supplied by the petitioner to the defendant Brewing Company, and for a return of the same. The bill was dismissed by the Circuit
Court and the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Appeals. 195 Fed. Rep. 447; ibid. 1023, where Pritchard, J., dissented from the refusal of a rehearing. 115 C.
C. A. 349; ibid. 669.
The contract under which the tanks were furnished
provided that the title should remain in the petitioner
until they were fully paid for, and that the petitioner
might remove them on default. It was made on August 8,
1908, and duly recorded on December 7 of the same year.
Before those dates the Brewing Company had made a
mortgage of its land, brewery, 'and all the buildings,
machinery and appliances thereon erected or to be erected'
and the mortgage had been recorded. There were subsequent mortgages, judgment liens, &c., but they do not
need special mention. A bill was brought to foreclose the
first mortgage, to which the petitioner was not made a
party. A receiver was appointed and a sale ordered and
advertised. The petitioner then brought this bill against
the various adverse claimants, joining the receiver by
leave of court. The statute of West Virginia makes a
reservation of title such as the petitioner's 'void as to
creditors of, and purchasers Without notice from, such
buyer' unless a notice of the reservation is recorded as
therein required. Code (1906), § 3101.
In Holt v. Henley, 232 U. S. 637, the court had to consider a similar question of priority in view of a Virginia
statute like that of West Virginia upon which the petitioner relies, and, although in that case the conditional
sale'had not been recorded, it was held that the vendor
was to be preferred. The main question nqw before us
is whether this case is to be decided differently on the
ground that the tanks were 'an essential indispensable
part of the completed structure contemplated by the mortgage,' a question left open in the former decision. 232
U. S. 641. The tanks were essential to the working of the
brewery, and after they were installed the opening into
the recess in which they stood was bricked up. It may

DETROIT STEEL CO. v. SISTERSVILLE BREW. CO. 717

Opinion of the Court.

be assumed that they became part of the realty as between
mortgagor and mortgagee, but that is immaterial in equity,
however it may have been at the old common law. The
question is not whether they were attached to the soil,
but we repeat, whether the fact that they were necessary
to the working of the brewery gives a preference to the
mortgagee. We see no sufficient ground for that result.
This class of need to use property belonging to another is
not yet recognized by the law as a sufficient ground for
authority to appropriate it. If the owner of the tanks had
lent them it would be an extraordinary proposition that it
lost title when they were bricked in. That it contemplated
the ultimate passing of title upon an event that did not
happen makes its case no worse except so far as by statute
recording is made necessary to save its 'ights. The common law knows no objection to what commonly is called
a conditional s£1e. William W. Bierce, Ltd. v. Hutchins,
205 U. S. 340, 347, 348.
The cases to which the possible exception left open in
Holt v. Henley applies are principally those in which the
property claimed has become so intimately connected
with or embodied in that which is subject to the mortgage
that to reclaim it would more or less physically disintegrate the property held by the mortgagee; e. g. Porter
v. Pitlsburg Bessemer Steel Co., 122 U. S. 267. A. man
sometines may lose title without his consent, and it has
been held that he loses it even to an innocent converter
who has added labor of a value far in excess of that of the
original chattel. Wetherbee v. Green, 22 Michigan, 311.
When the obvious destination of an article is to be incorporated into a structure in such a way that to remove it
would destroy the other work, like bricks or beams in a
building, there is still stronger ground for not giving to title
an absolute right of way. But unless we give a mystic
importance to bolts and screws, the mere knowledge that
the chattel will be attached to the freehold is of no im-

portance, except perhaps as against innocent purchasers
for value before the sale was recorded, which the mortgagees were not. Holt v. Henley, 232 U. S. 637, 640, 641.
The damage that will be done by removal in this case is
trifling and the petitioner offers to make it good.
The West Virginia decisions that had been rendered
before the petitioner's contract was made, like thQse of
Virginia, favored the petitioner's right. Hurxthal v. Hurxthal, 45 W. Va. 584. We do not understand Lazear v.
Ohio Valley Steel Foundry Co., 65 W. Va. 105, to lay down
a different doctrine. We take it rather as turning on the
special effect of a sale to receivers whose certificates it was
thought were backed by a promise of the court that they
should constitute a first lien. Therefore, we find it unnecessary to consider whether otherwise the doctrine of Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S. 20, coupled with our own opinion that the rule applied in the earlier decision is correct,
would require us to follow that rather than the later case.
Decree reversed.
