Mr. J. E. McDonald, with whom Mr. L. E. Jeffries and

Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act there is no
presumption of negligence entering into the obligation,
and it was the duty of the plaintiff, in an action brought
by the servant against the master, to show affirmatively
that improper appliances were used and that the defects
insisted upon caused the accident through the negligence
of the master. Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Barrett, 166 U. S.

In all actions by the servant against the master brought
in the Federal courts for injuries sustained through negligence on account of defective machinery, the plaintiff must
show affirmatively throughout the entire case that the
master was negligent. See cases supra.
The law having placed the positive duty upon the
master to furnish reasonably safe appliances, the presumption of law is that the master has discharged his duty, and
there is also another presumption, that if they were defective the master 'did not know of it. 4 Thompson on
Negligence, § 3864.
It is not sufficient merely to prove that the servant was
injured through defective machinery or appliances, but
it must be shown that the master knew of the defects, or
by reasonable care ought to have known of them. 1 Labatt on M. & S., §§ 119-21, 128-133, 832-8; 2 Thompson

It was error of law on the part of the Circuit Judge,
affirmed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, not to
grant a new trial or to reduce it to conform to, the true
measure of damages provided for by the act of Congress
upon the ground that the verdict was so excessive under
the undisputed facts, as well as the charge of the court,
that it deprived the plaintiffs in error of their rights under
the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

The true rule in measuring damages for pecuniary loss
in cases like the present, is to ascertain the present net
income by deducting the cost of living and expenditures
from the gross income, and no more should be allowed than
the present value of the accumulation arising from such
net income, based upon the expectancy of the life of the
d[eceased, or for such length of time as the beneficiaries
would have been entitled to receive support or benefits
from him. Alabama Miner6;l Ry. Co. v. Jones, 62 Am.

the time of his death is not admissible for the purpose of
increasing the measure of damages. Brown v. Chicago &c.
Ry. Co., 64 Iowa, 652.
This court will examine the entire evidence and the
action of the state trial court and of the state Supreme
Court and if it is manifest from such evidence that a
verdict should not be sustained, as not in conformity with
,the measure of damages laid down by this court as provided in such statute, such fa[ilure is error of law upon the
face of the record, and this court has jurisdiction.

MR. JUSTICE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is an action under the Employers' Liability Act
of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, for causing the death
of the plaintiff's intestate. The plaintiff got a verdict for
$25,000, on which the court ordered judgment upon the
plaintiffs remitting $5000. Exceptions were taken but
the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
State. 79 S. E. Rep. 710. The exceptions related to the
instructions of the court on the matter of liability and
to the entering of judgment upon a verdict alleged to be
excessive. As to rulings of the former class we have indicated that when the statute is made a ground for bringing up ordinary questions of negligence we shall deal with
them in a summary way and usually content ourselves
with stating results. Whether such questions are open
in a case coming from a state court we need not decide,
as, if open, they can be disposed of in a few words.
The defendant was killed by the falling of his engine
through a burning trestle bridge. There was evidence
tending to show that the trestle was more or less rotten,
that the fire was caused by the dropping of coals from an
earlier train and that the erLgine might have been stopped
had a proper lookout been kept. The first complaint
is against an instruction to the effect that, if a servant is
injured through defective instrumentalities, it is prima
facie evidence of the master's negligence and that the
master 'assumes the burdert' of showing that he exercised
due care in furnishing them. Of course the burden of

proving negligence in a strict sense is on the plaintiff
throughout, as was recognized and stated later in the
charge. The phrase picked out for criticism did not
controvert that proposition but merely expressed in an
untechnical way that if the death was due to a defective
instrumentality and no explanation was given, the plaintiff
had sustained the burden. The instruction is criticised
further as if the judge had said res ipsa loquitur-which
would have been right or wrong according to the res referred to. The Judge did not say that the fall of the
engine was enough, but that proof of a defect in appliances
which the Company was bound to use care to keep in order
and which usually would be in order if due care was taken,
was prima facie evidence of neglect. The instruction concerned conditions likely to have existed for some time
(defective ash pan or damper on the engine and rotten
wood likely to take fire), about which the company had
better means of information than the plaintiff, and concerning which it offered precise evidence, which, however,
did not satisfy the jury. We should not reverse the judgment on this ground, even if an objection was open to an
isolated phrase to which no attention was called at the time.
The supposed error most insisted upon is the entering
of judgment upon a verdict said to be manifestly excessive.
It is admitted that the judge charged the jury correctly,
according to principles established by Michigan Central
R. R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, but it is thought to be
apparent as matter of law that the jury found more than
the charge or the law allowed. The argument is this.
The deceased was making not more than $900 a year and
the only visible ground of increase was the possibility
that he might be promoted from fireman to engineer, with
what pay was not shown. He could not have given more
than $700 a year to his family. His expectation of life
was about thirty years by the tables of mortality. Therefore at the legal rate of interest the income from $10,000

for thirty years was all that the plaintiff was entitled to,
whereas she was given the principal of 920,000 out and
out. it may ,be admitted that if it were true that the
excess appeared as matter of law; that if, for instance, the
statute fixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it, a
question might arise for this court. But a case 'of mere
excess upon the evidence is a matter to be dealt with by the
trial court. It does not present a question for reexamination here upon a writ of error. Lincoln v. Power, 151 U. S.
436. Herencia v. Guzman, 219 U. S. 44, 45. The premises
of the argument for the plaintiff in error were not conclusive upon the jury, and although the verdict may seem
to us too large, no such error appears as to warrant our
imputing to judge and jury a connivance in escaping the
limits of the law.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

No. 89.

Argued March 3, 4, 1914.-Decided April 6, 1914.

Where the Supreme Court of a Territory has made a statement of
facts in the nature of a special verdict, this court must consider the
case when it comes here on appeal upon that finding.
In exercising appellate jurisdiction over the territorial courts in cases
involving construction of a statute by the Territory, this court will
not, in the absence of manifest error, reverse the action of the territorial court in regard to such construction; and so held as-to the construction placed by the Supreme Court of Arizona on the statutes of
that Territory defining the powers and duties of the Board of Equalization.
