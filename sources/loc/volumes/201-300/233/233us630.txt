As it thus appears that the decision of the Secretary of
the Interior was right in point of law, and as it was conclusive upon all questions of fact (Gertgens v. O'Connor,
supra), it follows that the state court erred in not sustaining Logan's title obtained under that decision.

SMITH v. STATE OF TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS.
No. 268. Argued March 12, 1914.-Decided May 11, 1914.
Life, liberty, property and equal protection of the laws as grouped to-,
gether in the Constitution are so related that the deprivation of any
one may lessen or extinguish the value of the others.
In so far as a man is deprived of the right to labor, his liberty is restricted, his capacity to earn wages and acquire property is lessened,
and he is denied the protection which the law affords those who are
permitted to work.
Liberty means more than freedom from servitude; and the constitutional guarantee is an assurance that the citizen shall be protected
in the right to use his powers of mind and body in any lawful calling.
A State may prescribe qualifications and require an examination to
test the fitness of any' person to engage, or remain, in the public
calling.
While the State may legislate in regard to the fitness of persons privately
employed in a business in which public health and safety are concerned, the tests and prohibitions must be enacted with reference to
such business, and not so as to unlawfully interfere with private business or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful
occupations. Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S.133.
Arbitrary tests by which competent persons are excluded from lawful
employment must be avoided in state regulations of employment in
private business affecting public health and safety. Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S.465.
The statute of Texas of 1909 prohibiting any person from acting as a
conductor on a railroad train without having for two years prior
thereto worked as a brakeman or conductor of a freight train and
prescribing no other qualifications, excludes the whole body of the

public from the right to secure employment as conductors and
amounts, as to persons competent to fill the position but who have
not the specified qualification, to a denial of the equal protection of
the law.
A'State cannot, in permitting certain competent persons to accept a
specified private employment, lay down a test which absolutely prohibits other competent persons from entering that employment.
Quere, whether such a statute is not also unconstitutional under the
Commerce Clause as applied to conductors employed on trains engaged in interstate commerce.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
statute of Texas of 1909 prescribing qualifications for conductors on railroad trains, are stated in the opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

County, 102 U. S. 691; N. Y., N. H. & H. Ry. Co. v.
New York, 165 U. S. 628.
MR. JUSTICE LAmAR delivered the opinion of the court.
W. W. Smith, the plaintiff in error, a man 47 years of
age, had spent 21 years in the railroad business. He had
never been a brakeman or a conductor, but for six years he
served as fireman, for three years ran as extra engineer on a
freight train, for eight years was engineer on a mixed
train, hauling freight and passengers, and for four years
had been engineer on a passenger train of the Texas &
Gulf Railway. On July 22, 1910, he acted as conductor of
a freight train running between two Texas towns on that
road. There is no claim in the brief for the State that he
was not competent to perform the duties of that position.
On the contrary it affirmatively and without contradiction
appeared that the plaintiff in error, like other locomotive
engineers, was familiar with the duties of that position and
was competent to discharge them with skill and efficiency.
He was, however, found guilty of the offense of violating
the Texas statute which makes it unlawful for any person
to actI as conductor of a freight train without having
SEC. 2. If any person shall act or engage to act as a conductor on
a railroad train in this State without having for two (2) years prior
thereto served or worked in the capacity of a brakeman or conductor
on a freight train on a line of railroad, he shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than twentyfive dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and each day he so engages shall constitute a separate offense.

SEC. 3. If any person shall knowingly engage, promote, require,
persuade, prevail upon or cause any person to do any act in violation
of the provisions of the two preceding sections of this act, he shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not
less than twenty-fiv'e dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and
each day he so engages shall constitute a separate offense. (Act of
March 11, 1909, c. 46, General Laws of Texas 1909, p. 92.)

previously served for two years as conductor or brakeman
on such trains. On that verdict he was sentenced to pay a
fine and the judgment having been affirmed the case is
here on a record in which he contends that the statute
under which he was convicted violated the provisions of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
1. Life, liberty, property and the equal protection of
the law, grouped together in the Constitution, are so
related that the deprivation of any one of those separate
and independent rights may lessen or extinguish the value
of the other three. In so far as a man is deprived of the
right to labor his liberty is restricted, his capacity to earn
wages and acquire property is lessened, and he is denied
the protection which the law affords those who are r mitted to work. Liberty means more than freedom from
servitude, and the constitutional guarantee is an assurance
that the citizen shall be protected in the right to use his
powers of mind and body in any lawful calling.
If the service is public the State may prescribe qualifications and require an examination to test the fitness of any
person to engage in or remain in the public calling. Ex
parte Lockwood, 154 U. S. 116; Hawker v. New York, 170
U. S. 189; Watson v. Maryland,218 U. S. 173. The private
employer may likewise fix standards and tests, but, if his
business is one in which the public health or safety is
concerned, the State may legislate so as to exclude from
work in such private calling those whose incompetence
might cause injury to the public. But as the public interest is the basis of such legislation, the tests and prohibition should be enacted with reference to that object
and so as not unduly to "interfere with private business,
or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon
lawful occupations." Lawton v. Steel, 152 U. S. 133, 137.
A discussion of legislation of this nature is found in
Nashville &c. Ry. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96, 98, where this
court sustained the validity of a statute which required

SMITH v. TEXAS.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

all locomotive engineers to submit to an examination for
color-blindness and then provided that those unable to
distinguish signals should not act as engineers on railroad
trains. That statute did not prevent any competent
person from being employed, but operated merely to
exclude those who, on examination were found to be
physically unfit for the discharge of a duty where defective
eyesight was almost certain to cause loss of life or limb.
Another case cited by the plaintiff in error is that of Dent
v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114. The act there under
review provided that no one except licensed physicians
should be allowed to practice medicine, and declared that
licenses should be issued by the State Board of Health
only to those (1) who were graduates of a reputable medical college; (2) to those who had practiced medicine
continuously for ten years; or (3) to those who after examination were found qualified to practice. Ten years' experience was accepted as proof of fitness, but such experience
was not made the sole test, since the privilege of practicing was attainable by all others who, by producing a diploma or by standing an examination, could show that
they were qualified for the performance of the duties of
the profession. In answer to the contention that the act
was void because it deprived the citizen of the liberty to
contract and the right to labor the court said no objection could be raised to the statutory requirements "because of their stringency or difficulty. It is only when
they have no relation to such calling" or profession, or are
unattainable by such reasonable study and application,
that they can operate to deprive one of his right to pursue a lawful vocation" (p. 122).
The necessity of avoiding the fixing of arbitrary tests
by which competent persons would be excluded from lawful employment is also recognized in Smith v. Alabama,
124 U. S. 465, 480. There the act provided that all engineers should secure a licease, and in sustaining the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

validity of the statute the court pointed out that the law
"requires that every locomotive engineer shall have a
license, but it does not limit the number of persons who
may be licensed nor prescribe any arbitrary conditions
to the grant." This and the other cases establish, beyond
controversy, that in the exercise of the police power the
State may prescribe tests and require a license from those
who wish to engage in or remain in a private calling affecting the public safety. The liberty of contract is, of course,
not unlimited; but there is no reason or authority for the
proposition that conditions may be imposed by statute
which will admit some who are competent and arbitrarily
exclude others who are equally competent to labor on
terms mutually satisfactory to employer and employ6.
None of the cases sustains the proposition that, under the
power to secure the public safety, a privileged class can
be created and be then given a monopoly of the right to
work in a special or favored position. Such a statute
would shut the door, without a hearing, upon many persons and classes of persons who were competent to serve
and would deprive them of the liberty to work in a calling
they were qualified to fill with safety to the public and
benefit to themselves.
2. The statute here under consideration permits those
who had been freight conductors for two years before the
law was passed, and those who for two years have been
freight conductors in other States, to act in the same
capacity in the State of Texas. But barring these exceptional cases, the act pdrmits brakemen on freight trains
to be promoted to the position of conductor on a freight
train, but excludes all other citizens of the United States
from the right to engage in such service. The statute
does not require the brakeman to prove his fitness, though
it does prevent all 'others from showing that they are competent. The act prescribes no other qualification, for
appointment as conductor, than that for two years the

SMITH v.
233 U. S.

TEXAS.

Opinion of the Court.

applicant should have been a brakeman on a freight train,
but affords no opportunity to any others to prove their
fitness. It thus absolutely excludes the whole body of
the public, including many railroad men, from the right
to secure employment as conductor on a freight train.
For it is to be noted that under this statute, not only
the general public, but also four classes of railroad men,
familiar with the movement and operation of trains and
having the same kind of experience as a brakeman, are
given no chance to show their competency but are arbitrarily denied the right to act as conductors. The statute
excludes firemen and engineers of all trains and all brakemen and conductors of passenger trains. But no reason
is suggested why a brakeman on a passenger train should
be denied the right to serve in a position. that the brakeman on a freight train is permitted to fill. Both have the
same class of work to do, both acquire the same familiarity
with rules, signals and methods of moving and distributing
cars, and if the training of one qualifies him to serve as conductor the like training of the other should not exclude
him from the right to earn his living in the same occupation.
It is argued in the brief for the State that in practice,
brakemen on freight trains are generally promoted to the
position of freight conductors and then to the position of
conductors on passenger trains. And yet, under this act
even passenger conductors, of the greatest experience and
highest capacity, would be punished if they acted as
freight conductors without having previously been brakemen.
The statute not only prevents experienced and competent men in the passenger service from acting as freight
conductors, but it excludes the engineer on a freight
train,-even though, under the rules of all railroads, the
freight engineer now acts as conductor in the event the
regular conductor is disabled en route. This general cus-

640

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

tom is a practical recognition of their qualification and is
founded on the fact that the engineer, by virtue of his
position, is familiar wit the rules and signals relating
to the train's movement and peculiarly qualified for the
performance of the duties of conductor. If we cannot
take judicial knowledge of these facts the record contains
affirmative proof on the subject. For, according to the
testimony I of the State's witness "acting as engineer on
understand the railroad business and know that a locomotive
engineer learns as much about how a freight train should be operated
by a conductor as a brakeman or conductor. Acting as engineer on' a
freight train will better acquaint one with a knowledge of how to operate a freight train than acting as brakeman. Under the rules of all
railroads, and of The Texas & Gulf Railway Company, the engineer
is held equally responsible with the conductor for the safe operation
of the train. All orders are given to the engineer as well as to the conductor. Every order sent to a conductor on a train is made in duplicate
and one copy of it is given to the conductor and the other to the engineer. It is a rule with railway companies that if anything should
happen to disable the conductor or in any way prevent his proceeding
with his train, the engineer is to immediately take charge of the train
and handle it into the terminal. The engineer is constantly with the
train and knows all of the signals, knows how the couplings are made,
knows how the cars are switched and distributed, and knows how they
are taken into the train and transported from one place to another.
An engineer is so constantly associated with all the work of a conductor
on a freight train that he should know as much about how a freight
train should be operated by a conductor as the conductor himself. All
actions of the conductor that pertain to the safe operation of the train
are being carried on in his presence and within his observation *allthe
time. The matter of handling the way bills and ascertaining the destinations of the cars in his train is easy and plain, and it does not take a
person that has had experience as a conductor to understand that part
of his service. The Way bills are plainly written and the destinations
plainly given, and booking the way bills and delivering them with the
cars is clerical, and can be done by any one that can read and write
and who has ordinary sense. Every act that is to be done by the conductor toward the safe handling of the train also has to be done by the
engineer, and all of the conductor's acts with reference to this are in the
view and observation of the engineer.
1I

SMITH v. TEXAS.

Opinion of the Court.

a freight train will better acquaint one with a knowledge
of how to operate a freight train than acting as brakeman."
And yet, though at least equally competent, the engineer
is denied the right to serve as conductor and the exclusive
right of appointment and prorotion to.that position is
conferred upon brakemen.
3. So that the case distinctly raises the question as to
whether a statute, in permitting certain competent men
to serve, can lay down a test which absolutely prohibits
other competent men from entering the same private
employment. It would seem that to ask the question is
to answer it-and the answer in no way denies the right
of the State to require examinations to test the fitness and
capacity of brakemen, firemen, engineers and conductors
to enter upon a service fraught with so much of risk to
themselves and to the public. But all men are entitled
to the equal protection of the law in their right to work
for the support of themselves and families. A statute
which permits the brakeman to act-because he is presumptively competent-and prohibits the employment of
engineers and all others who can affirmatively prove that
they are likewise competent, is not confined to securing
the public safety but denies to many the liberty of contract granted to brakemen and operates to establish rules
of promotion in a private employment.
If brakemen only are allowed the right of appointment
to the position of conductors, then a privilege is given to
them which is denied all other citizens of the United States.
If the statute can fix the class from which conductors on
freight trains shall be taken, another statute could limit
the class from which brakemen and conductors on passenger trains could be selected, and so, progressively, the
whole matter, as to who could enter the railroad service
and who could go from one position to another, would be
regulated by statute. In the nature of the case, promotion is a matter of private business management, and

should be left to the carrier company, which, bound to
serve the public, is held to- the exercise of diligence in
selecting competent men, and responsible in law for the
acts of those who fill any of these positions.
4. There was evidence that Smith safely and properly
operated the train which had in it cars containing freight
destined for points in Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma and
Kansas. But in view of what has been said it is iot necessary to consider whether the plaintiff, as engineer, was
in a position to raise the point that under the decision in
Adams Express Co. v. City of New York, 232 U. S. 14, the
statute interfered with interstate commerce.
The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the
Court of CriminalAppeals of the State of Texas for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

ERROR TO THE JUSTICE COURT, PRECINCT NO. 7,

COUNTY, TEXAS.
No. 522.

Submitted February 24, 1914.-Decided May 11, 1914.

Where a state statute has been held unconstitutional under the state
constitution by an inferior state court, and subsequently has been
upheld by the highest court of the State, this court, when the case is
properly here under § 237, Judicial Code, must regard the statute as
valid under the state constitution and consider only the question of

its validity under the Federal Constitution, although intermediately
this court has followed the decision of the lower state court.
The validity of a state statute under the commerce clause or the Act
to Regulate Commerce cannot be attacked in a suit which is not
based upon a claim arising out of interstate commerce.
A State may classify claims against persons or corporations where

there is no classification of debtors and where the claims are not
grouped together for the purpose of bearing against any class of
citLzns or corporations.
