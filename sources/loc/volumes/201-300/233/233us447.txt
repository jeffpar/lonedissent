ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
PORTO RICO.
No. 130. Submitted December 12, 1913; Restored to docket for reargu.
ment January 26, 1914; Reargued April 6, 7, 1914.-Decided April 20,
1914.
The Civil Code of Porto Rico of March 1, 1902, did not go into effect
until July 1, 1902, Ortega v. Lara, 202 U. S. 339, and prior thereto
the wife's assent to a conveyance by her husband was not necessary.
Decisions of this court and of the local courts as to the date when a
code of law making ,material changes in the prior existing law went
into effect may well become a rule of property which should not be
disturbed by subsequent conflicting decisions.
This court, as a general rule, is unwilling to overrule local tribunals
upon matters of purely local concern. SantaFe CentralRy. v. Friday,

dence; as to excluding admission of Sanjurjo; excluding
the statement as to property 'inherited by Altagracia
Nadal; in the admission of the statement as to the liquidation of community property; the last inquiry is not within
the issues nor is it material.
There was error in giving the peremptory charge. The
plaintiff had established a prima facie case and defendant
did not overcome it. There was error in overruling the
demurrer to the special defense and holding the same sufficient to warrant directing a verdict for defendant.
The allegations were not sufficient to constitute estoppel.

tion for itself as an independent legal proposition, but
was merely misled by the recital contained in the certificate
of the Secretary of Porto Rico prefixed to the official
printed volume of the Codes. See Morales v. Registrar,
16 P. R. Fed. Rep. 109, 114. See also ยง 41, Political Code,
that every statute, unless a different time is prescribed
therein, takes effect from its passage.
This section is but declaratory of the law as uniformly
settled in the absence of any express provision to the contrary. Matthews v. Zane, 7 Wheat. 164, 211; Memphis v.
United States, 97 U. S. 293, 296; Seven Hickory v. Ellery, 103

The Revised Civil Code was approved by the governor
of Porto Rico on March 1, 1902, and went into effect on
that day as a matter of law.
The validating act of February 24, 1903, was not effectual. It is clearly an attempt at retroactive legislation
which is invalid, if applied to the conveyance in question,
because it divests the settled rights of property. Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 661; Mitchell v. Campbell, 19 Oregon,

The meaning of paragraph seven of the will is not doubtful, nor is the doctrine of innocent purchaser applicable.
Division of community property is not necessarily a
matter of probate jurisdiction.

VOL. ccxxxiii-29

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

The new Civil Code did not go into effect until July 1,
1902, and the controlling conveyance of June 2, 1902,
under the then existing Spanish Civil Code was properly
made by the husband without the consent of the wife.
The will under which plaintiff claims conveys to him no
interest in "Carmen."
As a bona fide purchaser for value ("third person") the
People of Porto Rico could rely on the record title and
took a clear title, for no defect or cautionary notice appeared in the registry against "Carmen."
Plaintiff's claim involves a preceding liquidation of a
community between husband and wife. This is solely a
subject-matter for the local probate court and beyond
the jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States

for Porto Rico.
The exceptions to rulings on evidence are without merit.
In support of these contentions, see Amadeo v. Registrar, 3

MR. JUSTIcE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a suit by the plaintiff in error to establish his title
to one-half interest in a plantation called 'Carmen,' as
devisee of his aunt, Altagracia Nadal. It is alleged that
the plantation was bought with the Separate money of
Altagracia Nadal by her husband, after marriage; that
she became the owner of one undivided half, subject to

NADAL v. MAY.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the administration of her husband until the termination
of the conjugal partnership, and that this .half passed to
her devisee at her death. The complaint admits that after
the purchase the husband purported to convey the whole
plantation to a third person but alleges that the wife did
not consent to the conveyance and that therefore her rights
remained.
It appears that on May 1, 1901, Altagracia Nadal
brought a suit against her husband for an account of her
paraphernal property, alleging among other things, that
he had recorded in his favor the estate Carmen, acquired
by a deed of October 25, 1900, and praying judgment that
it was her private property because bought with her separate funds, and for a cautionary notice to be entered in the
registry. On November 10, 1901, a settlement was made
by which it was stated that the husband had received ten
thousand dollars as the product of the wife's paraphernal
property, had paid her five thousand dollars and given a
mortgage for the other five thousand, and in view thereof
she "renounces all the rights and interests which she might
have against her husband because of the facts stated in the
said complaint." The 5instrument was presented to the
court with a prayer that the court would hold that the
parties had desisted from continuing the action and that
the cautionary notice be cancelled, which was granted on
November 21. Therb had been conveyances of Carmen,
without consideration, it was testified; there was a reconveyance to the husband, and on June 2, 1902, he conveyed
it, without his wife's consent, to Elisa Sanjurjo, who on
August 29 of the same year conveyed it to the People of
Porto Rico, for valuable consideration, there being then no
cautionary notice on record. On April 10, 1906, the wife
assigned to the plaintiff the mortgage received by her on
the above settlement, and on April 27, 1906, made the will
under which the plaintiff claims.
By this will the testatrix left to the plaintiff a mortgage

described, with all its rights and actions (asicomotodos sus
derechos y acciones) and also the mortgage assigned on
April 10, in case the assignment should not have been
effective in favor of her said nephew 'Rafael Martinez y
Nadal, todos los derechos y acciones que puedan caberme en
los bienes mios que estgn 4 nombre de mi esposo Isidro Fernandez Sanjurjo, en virtud de la transacci6n celebrada con
mi dichoesposo.'
The plaintiff's claim is founded on these last words.
The official translation accepted by the court reads that
she leaves the mortgage "in case the assignment shall not
have become effective, all the rights and actions which
may pertain to me in my properties which are in the name
of my husband Isidro Fernandez Sanjurjo, by virtue of
the settlement made with my said husband." The plaintiff contends that the word 'and' should be read in before 'all the rights and actions' on the notion that a y
has dropped out or should be implied. He argues that the
estate Carmen was not embraced in the settlement, because community property in which the wife had and retained a community interest and that the last words devise it-en virtud de signifying more nearly in spite of the
settlement than by virtue of it.
On the other hand it is argued that the settlement renounced all claim by the wife to Carmen if any she had;
that the last words of the will have an import similar to
that of those used in connection with the previous mortgage; that en virtud de means by virtue of; that if the wife
had a claim it was outside the settlement and those words
would not. describe it, even if at the date of the will the
estate had still stood in the husband's name, where
notoriously and as she well knew it had not stood for
years. The government also claims as a bona fide purchaser without nQtice. It is obvious, we think, from this
summary that these arguments against the plaintiff's
claim are hard to meet, and they were not met. But it is

Opinion of the Court.

not necessary absolutely to decide on their validity as the
case is disposed of by a preliminary point.
Both sides agree that the wife's assent to a conveyance
by her husband was made necessary for the first time by
ยง 1328 of the Civil Code of March 1, 1902. Unless that
Code went into effect at its date it did not apply to the
conveyance of June 2. The plaintiff argues with much
force that it was in effect then and that the decisions to
the contrary are all based on a mistaken certificate of the
Secretary of Porto Rico, but we are of opinion that the
considerations on the other side mu~t prevail. On the
last day of its session the Legislature passed four codes
making material changes in the existing law-the Political
Code, the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and
the Civil Code, which although in form separate acts
were published in one volume and ,constituted a large part
of a system. Two of theise Codes fixed July 1, 1902, as the
time for their taking effect. It was the duty of the Secretary to promulgate the laws (Act of Congress of April 12,
1900, c. 191, ยง 19, 31 Stat. 77, 81), and he was directed
by an act of the same date as that of the Codes to revise
and arrange the provisions of the Codes for publication
along with the Joint Codes. Committee of the Legislature;
the arrangement to be completed as soon as practicable
after April 1, and publication being expected on or before
August 1. A resolution of the day before shows that they
had to be enacted before enrollment with manuscript corrections. Rev. Stats. & Codes of Porto Rico, 1902, p. 299.
The Secretary certified that they were in effect on and
after July 1, 1902. But the injustice of making the Civil
Code operative before its contents could be known and
before the revision contemplated by the law was so manifest that on February 24,. 1903, an act was passed purporting to validate all conveyances of real estate and in
general all acts that required certification by a notary
executed after March 1, 1902, and on or before January 1,

1903, if they would have been valid by the laws in force
on February 28,1902. This court assumed that the Civil
Code went into effect on July 1, in Ortega v. Lara, 202 U. S.
339, 343, and the Supreme Court of Porto Rico has decided the same point twice. Estate of Morales v. The Registrar of Property of Caguas, 16 P. R. Fed. Rep. 109, 114.
Bus6 v. BuS6, 18 P. R. Fed. Rep. 864, 867, 868. It is impossible to know how many or how important transactions
may have taken place on the faith of these repeated solemn
assurances, and apart from the general unwillingness of
this court to overrule the local tribunals upon matters of
purely local concern, Santa Fe Central Ry. Co. v. Friday,
232 U. S. 694, 700, it is not too much to say that the decisions have become a rule of property, even if we did not
think, as we do, that probably the Secretary's certificate
expressed the legislative will.
