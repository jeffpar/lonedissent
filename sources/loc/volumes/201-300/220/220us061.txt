LINDSLEY v. NATURAL CARBONIC GAS
COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 260. Argued January 3, 4, 1911.-Decided March 13, 1911.
Courts of the United States must accept the construction put upon a
state statute by the highest court of the State; and, in determining
the constitutionality of a, state statute, this court is not concerned
with provisions thereof which the highest court of the State has
declared invalid.
It is within the power of the State, consistently with due process of law,
to prohibit the owner of the surface by pumping on his own land,
water, gas and oil, to deplete the subterranean supply common to
him and.other owners to their: injury; and so held that the statute
of New York protecting mineral springs is not, as the same has been
construed by the Court of Appeals of that State, unconstitutional as
depriving owners of their property without due process of law.
Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, 177 U. S. 190.
This court cannot give effect to statements not supported by the
record and contrary to the situation as it appears to have been regarded by the highest court of the State, and which is not inconsistent with the allegations of the bill.
If the facts alleged by one contesting the constitutionality of a state
statute take him out of the operation of the statute, as construed by
the highest court of the State, he is not harmed by the statute and
cannot draw in question or test its validity.
The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment admits of
a wide exercise of discretion and only avoids a classification which is
purely arbitrary being without reasonable basis; nor does a classification having some reasonable basis offend because not made with
mathematical nicety or resulting in some inequality.
This court will assume the existence at the time the statute was enacted
of. any state of facts that can reasonably be conceived and which
will support a classification in a state statute attacked as denying
equal protection of the law.
The burden of showing that a classification in a state statute denies

equal protection of the law as not resting on a reasonable basis is on
the party assailing it.
A police statute may be confined to the occasion for its existence. If
there is a substantial difference in point of harmful results between
various methods of pumping gas and mineral water, that difference
justifies a classification, and the burden is on the attacking party to
prove the classification unreasonable; and so held that the classification in the New York Mineral Springs Act does not appear to be
arbitrary but.to rest on a reasonable basis.
Where it is not an arbitrary discrimination, and there is a rational
connection between two facts, a State may make'evidence of one of
such facts prima facie evidence of the other, so long as the right to
make a full defense is not cut ofl Mobile &c. R. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S.35; and so held that the New York Mineral Springs
Act is not rendered unconstitutional as denying equal protection of
the law by the ruling of the Court of Appeals, read into the statute,
that proof of certain designated facts amounts to prima facie proof
establishing a reasonable presumption, but one that can be overcome, that other acts of defendants fall within. the prohibition of
the statute.
170 Fed. Rep. 1023, affirmed.

Bya bill in equity exhibited in ,the Circuit Court the
appellant, as owner and holder of capital stock and bonds
of the Natural Carbonic .Gas Company, sought a decree
enjoining that. company from obeying, and the other defendants from enforcing, .a statute of the State of New
York, approved May 20, 1908, entitled "An act for the
protection of the natural mineral springs of the State
and to prevent waste and impairment of'its natural mineral waters," and containing, among others, this provision: "Pumping, or otherwise drawing by artificial appliance, from any well made by boring or drilling into
the rock, that class of mineral waters holding in solution
natural mineral salts and an excess of carbonic acid gas,
or pumping, or by any artificial contrivance whatsoever
in any manner producing an unnatural flow of carbonic
acid gas issuing from or contained in any well made by
boring or drilling into the rock, for the purpose of ex-

tracting, collecting, compressing, liquefying or vending
such gas- as a commodity otherwise than in connection
with the mineral water and the other mineral ingredients
with which it was associated, is hereby declared to be
unlawful." Laws 1908, vol. 2, 1221, ch. 429.
In addition to what properly may be passed without
special mention the bill alleges that the gas company
owns twenty-one acres of land in Saratoga Springs, New
York, which contain mineral waters of the class specified in the statute; that these waters are percolating
waters, iiof naturally flowing to or upon the surface, and
can be reached and lifted to the surface only by means
of pumps or other artificial appliances; that the gas company is engaged in collecting natural carbonic acid gas
from these waters and i4 compressing and selling the gas
as a separate commodity; that this business has come to
be both large and lucrative, and as a necessary incident
to its successful proseoution the gas company .has sunk
upon its land wells of great depth, made by boring or
drilling into. the underlying rock, and has fitted these
wells with tubing, seals and pumps, whereby it lifts the
waters and the gas contained therein to the surface; that
these pumps do not exercise any force of compulsion upon
waters in or under adjoining lands, but lift to the surface
only such waters as flow.by reason of the laws of nature
into the wells; that when the waters are lifted to the surface the excess of carbonic acid gas therein naturally escapes and is caught and compressed preparatory to its
sale, none thereof being wasted and no process being employed to increase the natural separation of the excess of
gas from the waters; and that many other land owners in
Saratoga Springs have like wells which are operated in a
like way with a like purpose.
It also is alleged that the gas company bottles and sells
for drinking purposes and for use by invalids and others
all of the mineral waters pumped from its wells "for

which there is any market or demand," but there is no
allegation of the extent of this market or demand, and
it was conceded in argument that a large proportion of
the waters pumped from the company's wells is not used,
but is suffered to run to waste.
In terms the bill predicates the right to the relief
sought* upon the claim that the state statute deprives
the appellant*and others of property without due process
of law and denies to them the equal protection of the
laws, and therefore is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
In the Circuit Court the defendants other than the gas
company demurred to the bill, the demurrers were sustained (170 Fed. Rep. 1023), and a decree dismissing the
bill was entered, whereupon this appeal was prayed and
allowed.
Mr. Guthrie B. Plante and Mr. Edgar T. Brackett, with
whom Mr. Robert C. Morris was on the brief, for appellant:
The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment in
that it deprives the gas company without due process of
law of liberty and property-meaning the profitable and
free use of property by its owner. Chicago Ry. Co. v.

At common law the owner of land has a property right
in all water and gases that percolate or flow through the
soil or rocks, that he is able to reduce to possession, and
to use the same for his own purposes at his free will and
pleasure. Chasemore v. Richards, 7 H. L. Cas. 349; Bradford v. Pickles, Law Reporter, 1895, App. Cas. 587; and

The owner of lands owns the percolating water in the
soil by the same title as that on which he holds the land.
He may make such use of the percolating water as
he chooses, and is not liable for the interception of percolating water, even though it cuts off the supply of
the adjoining owner, unless one owner uses his lands
solely to obtain water from adjoining premises for purposes of transportation and sale. The same rule has been
held to apply to petroleum, oil and natural gas. Brown v.

Although the statute in question does not take the
property of the defendant and appropriate it to a public use, it does effectually deprive it of the beneficial use
and enjoyment of the property, not only without due
process of law, but without any pretense of compensation. Property does not consist alone in something that
is tangible, but the right to use is as much property as
the land itself. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, 589;
Chicago &c. R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418, 458;
Muhlker v. R. R. Co., 197 U. S. 544; Wester'elt v. Gregg,
12 N. Y. 202, 209; Forter v. Scott, 136 N. Y. 577, 584.
The police power only begins where the Constitution
ends; and when its exercise encroaches upon vested constitutional rights, courts should not be concerned with
the probable purposes for which it is exercised, or the
evils which it was designed to correct. The legislation
defended under this power must be reasonable, must be
moderate, and have proportion in its means to the end
sought to be reached. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623,
661; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 137; Wright v. Hart,
182 N. Y. 330, 341; Fisher v. Woods, 187 N. Y. 90, 94;
Health Dept. v. Rector, 145 N. Y. 32, 39.
The business conducted by this defendant is purely
private and not affected by public interest. The purpose
of the act is a purely private, and selfish one, namely, to
deprive the owners of wells which. are bored or sunk into
the rock of their property, and create business for the
benefit of owners of wells which are not sunk or drilled
into the rock, and to legislate out of existence the natural
gas industry. People v. Gillson, 109 N. Y. 389, 399;
Wright v. Hart, 182 N. Y. 330, 344; Huber v. Merkel, 117

lice Power, p. -61; People v. Gas Co., 196 N. Y. 421,
440.
The burden in this case is not fanciful, but real and
substantial; the placing of 'this burden of proof upon
one and not upon his neighbor similarly situated is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. County of San
Mateo v. Southern Pacific Ry. Co., 13 Fed. Rep. 722, 733;
Wynehamer v. People, 13 N. Y. 378, 446; People v. Lyon,
27 Hun, 180; Railroad Co. v. Huisen, 95 U. S. 465.
Defendant alike in civil as in criminal actions is entitled to a presumption of innocence. Especially is this
so in civil actions where the judgment will establish the
commission of a penal offense. Grant v. Riley, 15 A.'D.
190; Pollock v. Pollock, 71 N. Y. 137, 142; Wilcox v. Wilcox, 46 Hun, 32, 40; N. Y. & B. F. Co. v. Moore, 18 Abb.
N. C. 106,119. The applicable rule is that plaintiffs having invoked the aid of a statute have the burden of showing that their case is within the provisions of the-statute.
Cohoes v. D. H. C. Co., 134 N. Y. 397; Miller v. Roessler, 4 E. D. Smith, 234.
The act denies the equal protection of the laws by
prohibiting pumping for the purpose of vending the gas,
while permitting the same for any other purpose or use,
and prohibiting pumping of wells that go into the rock and
permitting pumping of wells that do not go into the rock.
Before classification of this kind can be successfully
accomplished some difference must be shown bearing a
reasonable and just relation to the things as to which
the classification is established. To be constitutional,
the law must bear equally upon all engaged in a like
business. Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22; Reagan v.

Restricting the use of property or the taking or depriving of any right therein is a taking of property within
the meaning of the Constitution, and when such restriction or taking is primarily for the benefit of other individuals, or to aid the use by individuals of their property,
in which the public has no use but only an indirect benefit, if any, then the taking is of private property for private purposes and is prohibited by the constitutional enactments.
Mr. Charles C. Lester and Mr. Nash Rockwood, with
whom Mr. Edward R. O'Malley, Attorney General of the
State of New York, was on the brief, for appellees7
This court will accept and follow the interpretation of
the statute as given, by the state tribunals; and the judgment of the state courts construing the meaning and scope
of the act is conclusive here. The interpretation of this
act by the Court of Appeals is in precise accord with the
common-law rule of relative property rights which has long
been declared and •enforced in the State to which the statUte applies. The statute, as so construed, infringes no
property right, and transcends no constitutional limitation.

The courts of the several States have the right to construe their own statutes; this is a function to be exercised
exclusively by them, and their judgment upon such matters is conclusive upon all Federal tribunals. Palmer v.

The act is constitutional. - The doctrine enunciated by '
the Court of Appeals in the cases arising under the present statute is not a new doctrine, but has been stated in
successive decisions and recognized as the law of the
State of New York. See cases supra. Merrick Water Co.

The act does not deny equal protection of the laws.
it creates no class of persons deprived of the equal protection of the laws. All are alike forbidden to pump such
wells; all persons similarly situated are affected alike; it
does not unlawfully discriminate against any. State v.

A statute is not obnoxious to the constitutional provision in question because its effect may be confined to a
particular class of citizens, if the law be general in its
application to the class to which it applies and if the distinction be not arbitrary, but rests upon some reason of
public policy growing out of the condition of business of
such class. People v. Havnor, 149 N. Y. 195; Missouri v.

The legislature has the right of judging what it deems
harmful or what it deems should be safeguarded and need
not include all harmful acts or guard against everything
that apparently needs guarding. Musco v. United Surety

The act is a valid exercise of the police power. Its
purpose and effect are to prevent the waste and destruction of the natural resources of the State. Cooley on

With questions of expediency, wisdom, fairness and
cther like questions the courts have nothing to do, unless
the act exceeds all bounds of reason; the judgment of the
legislature is final. Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161,

The statute, against whose enforcement the suit is directed, contains several restrictive provisions more or less
directly connected with the purpose suggested by its title,
but we are concerned with only the one before set forth,
because the Court of Appeals of the State has pronounced

LINDSLEY v. NATURAL CARBONIC GAS CO.
220 U. S.

73

Opinion of the Court.

the others invalid and counsel have treated them as
thereby eliminated from the statute and from present
consideration.
Coming to the provision in question, it is necessary to
inquire what construction has been put upon it by the
highest court of the State, for that construction must be
accepted by the courts of the United States and be regarded by them as a part of the provision when they are
called-upon to determine whether it violates any right
secured by the Federal Constitution. Weightman v. Clark,
103 U. S. 256, 260; Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., 146
U. S. 162, 166; Olsen v. Smith, 195 U. S. 333, 342. The
Court of Appeals of the State had the statute before it in
Hathorn v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 194 N. Y. 326, and
again in People v. New York Carbonic Acid Gas Co., 196
N. Y. 421, and the elaborate opinions then rendered disclose that the court, having regard to the title of the act
and to the doctrine of correlative rights in percolating
waters which prevails in that State, as recognized in
Forbell v. City of New York, 164 N. Y. 522, construed this
provision, not as prohibiting the specified acts absolutely
or unqualifiedly, but only when the mineral waters are
drawn from a source of supply not confined to the lands
of the actor but extending into or through the lands of
others, and then only when the draft made upon that
source of supply is unreasonable or wasteful, considering
that there-is a coequal right in all the surface owners to
draw upon it. In other words, the court, by processes of
interpretation having its approval, read into the provision
an exception or qualification making it inapplicable where
the waters are not drawn from a common source of supply,
and also where, if they be drawn from such a source, no
injury is done thereby to others having a like right to
resort to it.
As so interpreted, the statute presupposes (1) the existence, in porous rock beneath the lands of several pro-

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

prietors, of a supply of mineral waters of the class specified; (2) a right in each proprietor to penetrate the
underlying rock or natural reservoir and to draw upon
the supply therein; and (3) a practice or tendency on the
part of proprietors who exercise this right in the manner
and for the purpose specified, that is, by boring or drilling
wells into the rock and pumping or artificially drawing
the waters for the purpose of collecting and vending the
gas as a separate commodity, to make excessive or wasteful drafts upon the common supply to the injury and
impairment of the rights of other proprietors. And what
is thus presupposed is treated in several decisions of the
courts of the State and in other public papers as having
actual existence and as being widely recognized. It is to
prevent or avoid the injury and waste suggested that the
statute was adopted. It is not the first of its type. One
in principle quite like it was considered by this court in
Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, 177 U. S. 190. There oil and gas
in a commingled form were contained in a stratum of
porous rock, underlying the lands of many owners, and
because these fluids were inclined to shift about in the
common reservoir in obedience to natural laws one surface
owner could not excessively or wastefully exercise his
right of tapping the reservoir and drawing from its contents without injuriously affecting the like righu of each
of the others. The oil and gas were both of value, but as
the greater value attached to the oil some' surface owners,
whose wells tapped the common reservoir and brought to
the surface both oil and gas, collected and used only the
oil and suffered the gas to disperse in the air. This and
kindred practices resulted in the adoption of a statute
declaring them unlawful, and the validity of the statute
was called in question. The objections urged against it
were much the same as those now pressed upon our attention, but upon full consideration all were -overruled. After
commenting upon the peculiar attributes of oil and gas

LINDSLEYv. NATURAL CARBONIC GAS CO.

75

Opinion of the Court.

which cause them be to excepted from the principles generally applied to minerals having a fixed situs, and also
upon :the prevailing rule that each surface owner in an oil
and gas area has the exclusive right on his own land to
seek the oil and gas in the reservoir beneath, but has no
fixed or certain ownership of them until he reduces them
to actual possession, this court said:
"They [meaning the surface owners] could not be absolutely deprived of this right which belongs to them without
a taking of private property. But there is a coequal right
in them all to take from a common source of supply the
two substances which, in the-nature of things, are united,
though separate. It follows, from the essence of their
right and from the situation of the things as to which it
can be exerted, that the use by one of his power to seek to
-convert a part of the common fund to actual possession
may -resultin an undue proportion being attributed to one
of the possessors of the right, to the detriment of the
others, or by waste by one or more, to the annihilation of
the rights of the remainder. Hence it is that the legislative power, from the peculiar nature of the right and the
objects upon which it -is
to be exerted, can be manifested
for the purpose of protecting all the collective owners by
securing a just distribution to arise from the enjoyment
by them of their privilege to reduce to possession and to
reach the like end by preventing waste. . . . Viewed,
then, as a statute to protect or to prevent the waste of the
common property of the surface owners, the law .
which is here attacked because it is asserted that it devested private property without due compensation, in
substance, is a statute protecting private property and
preventing it from being taken by one of the common
owners without regard to the enjoyment of the others."
And, taking up subordinate contentions advanced in
support of the principal one, the court also said:
"First. It is argued that as the gas, before being al-

lowed to disperse in the air, serves the purpose of forcing
up the oil, therefore it is not wasted, hence is-not subject
to regulation. Second. That the answer averred that the
defendant was so situated as not to be able to use or dispose of the gas which comes to the surface with the oil;
from which it follows that the gas must either be stored
or dispersed in the air. Now, the answer further asserted
that when the gas is stored and not used the back pressure,
on the best-known pump, would, if not arresting its
movement, at least greatly diminish its capacity. Hence
it is said the law, by making it unlawful to allow the gas
to escape, made it practically impossible to profitably extract the oil. That is, as the oil could not be taken at a
profit by one who made no use of the gas, therefore he
must be allowed to waste the gas into the atmosphere and"
thus destroy the interest of the other common owners in
the reservoir of gas. These contentions but state in a
different form the matters already disposed of. They
really go not to the power to make the regulations, but to
their wisdom. But with the lawful discretion of the legislature of the State we may not interfere."
If the statute there assailed did not work a deprivation
of property without due process of law, it is difficult to
perceive that there is any such deprivation in the present
case. The mineral waters and carbonic acid gas exist in a
commingled state in the underlying rock, and neither can
be drawn out without the other. They are of value in
their commingled form and also when separated, but the
greater demand is for the gas alone. Influenced by this
demand, some surface owners, having wells bored or
drilled into the rock, engage in extensive pumping operations for the purpose of collecting the gas and vending it
as a separate commodity. Usually where this is done an
undue proportion of the commingled waters and gas is
taken from the common supply and a large, if not the
larger, portion of the waters from which the gas is col-

Opinion of the Court.

lected is permitted to run to waste. Thus these pumping
operations generally result in an unreasonable and wasteful depletion of the common supply and in a corresponding
injury to others equally entitled to resort to it. It is to
correct this evil that the statute was adopted, and the
remedy which it applies is an enforced discontinuance of
the excessive and wasteful features of the pumping. It
does not take from any surface owner the right to tap the
underlying rock and to draw from the common supply,
but, consistently with the continued existence of that
right, so regulates its exercise as reasonably to conserve
the interests of all who possess it. That the State, consistently with due process of law, may do this is a necessary conclusion from the decision in the case cited.
But were the question an open one we still should solve it
in the same way.
We do not overlook the statement in appellant's brief
that the mineral waters reached by the gas company's
wells do not exist in any underground reservoir and do not
come from any common source, but we cannot give it any
effect. It is contrary to what the courts of the State apparently regard as the real situation at Saratoga Springs,
and is without support in the present record. While the
bill alleges that the waters are percolating waters, not
naturally flowing to or upon the surface, that description
of them is not inconsistent with their existence in a natural
reservoir of porous rock underlying the lands of several
owners. Besides, if we accepted it as true that they do
not constitute a common source of supply, that is, one to
which other surface owners have an equal right to resort,
it then would have to be held that the gas company's acts
are not within the prohibition of the statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals of the State, and therefore
that the appellant, as owner and holder of capital stock
and bonds of the company, is not harmed by the statute
and is not entitled to draw in question or test its validity.

Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114, 118; Tyler v. Judge,
179 U. g.'405; Turpin v. Lemon, 187 U. S. 51, 60; Hatch v.
Reardon; 204 U. S. 152, 160.
Neither do we overlook the allegation in the bill that the
gas company's pumps do not exert any force upon waters
in or.under adjoining lands, but lift to the surface only
such waters "as flow by reason of the laws of nature into
the wells;", but we regard it as of little importance, because if the wells reach a common source of supply excessive ,or wasteful pumping from them may affect injuriously the rights of other surface owners, although the
force exerted by the pumps does not reach their lands.
Because the statute is directed against pumping from
wells bored or drilled into the rock, but not against pumping from wells not penetrating the rock, and because it is
directed against pumping for the purpose of collecting
the gas and vending it apart from the waters, but not
against pumping for other purposes, the contention is
made that it is arbitrary in its classification, and consequently denies the 'equal protection of the laws to those
whom it affects.
The rules by which this contention must be tested, as
is shown by repeated decisions of this court, are these:
1. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the State the power to classify
in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise
of a wide scope of discretion in that regard, and avoids
what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis
and therefore is purely arbitrary. 2. A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that
clause merely because it is not made with mathematical
nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.
3. When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived
that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts
at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4. One

who assails the classification in such a law must carry the
burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary. Bachtel v. Wilson,
204 U. S. 36, 41; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Melton,
218 U. S. 36; Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Bank, 207
U. S. 251, 256; Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 132; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City, 173 U. S. 592, 615.
Unfortunately the allegations of the bill shed but little
light upon the classification in question. They do not
indicate that pumping from wells not penetrating the
rock appreciably affects the common supply therein, or
is calculated to result in injury tothe rights of others, and
neither do they indicate that such pumping as is done for
purposes other than collecting and vending the gas apart
from the waters is excessive or wasteful, or otherwise
operates to impair the rights of others. In other words, for
aught that appears in the bill, the classification may rest
upon some substantial difference between pumping from
wells penetrating the rock and pumping from those not
penetrating it, and between pumping for the purpose of
collecting and vending the gas apart from the waters and
pumping for other purposes, and this difference may afford a reasonable basis for the classification.
In thus criticising the bill, we do not mean that its allegations are alone to be considered, for due regard also must
be had for what is within the range of common knowledge
and what is otherwise plainly subject to judicial notice.
Brown v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37, 43; Brown v. Spilman, 155
U. S. 665, 670; McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co.,
203 U. S. 38, 51; McNichols v. Pease, 207 U. S. 100, 111.
But we rest our criticism upon the fact that the bill is
silent in respect of some matters which, although essential
to the success of the present contention, are neither within
the range of common knowledge nor otherwise plainly subject to judicial notice. So, applying the rule that one who
assails the classification in such a law must carry the

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

burden of showing that it is arbitrary, we properly might
dismiss the contention without saying more. But it may
be well to mention other considerations which make for
the same result.
From statements made in the briefs of counsel and in
oral argument we infer that wells not penetrating the rock
reach such waters only as escape naturally therefrom
through breaks or fissures, and .if this be so, it well may
be doubted that pumping from such wells has anything
like the same effect-if, indeed, it has any-upon the
common supply or upon the rights of others, as does
pumping from wells which take the waters from within
the rock where they exist under great hydrostatic pressure.
As respects the discrimination made between pumping
for the purpose of collecting and vending the gas apart
from the waters and pumping for other purlposes, this is
to be said: The greater demand for the gas alone and the
value which attaches to it in consequence of this demand
furnish a greater incentive for exercising the common
right excessively and wastefully when the pumping is for
the purpose proscribed than when it is for other purposes;
and this suggestion becomes stronger when it is reflected
that the proportion of gas in the commingled fluids as
they exist in the rock is so small that to obtain a given
quantity of gas involves the taking of an enormously
greater quantity of water and to satisfy appreciably the
demand for the gas alone involves a great waste of the
water from which it is collected. Thus, it well may be
that in actual practice the pumping is not excessive or
wasteful save when it is done for the purpose proscribed.
These considerations point with more or less persuasive
force to a substantial difference, in point of harmful results, between pumping from wells penetrating the rock
and pumping from those not penetrating it, and between
pumping for the purpose of collecting and vending the gas
apart from the waters and pumping for other purposes.

LINDSLEY v. NATURAL CARBONIC GAS CO. 81
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

If there be such a difference it justifies the classification,
for plainly a police law may be confined to the occasion
for its existence. As is said in Carrollv. Greenwich Insurance Co., 199 U. S. 401, 411: "If an evil is specially experienced in a particular branch of business, the Constitution embodies no prohibition of laws confined to the evil,
or doctrinaire requirementthat they should be couched
in all-embracing terms."
In conclusion upon this point, it suffices to say that the
case ds presented, instead of plainly disclosing that the
classification is arbitrary, tends to produce the belief that
it rests upon a reasonable basis.
Another objection urged against the statute arises out
of a ruling of the Court bf Appeals of the State, to the
effect that in proceedings for the enforcement of the
statute one who, for the purpose of collecting and vending the gas as a separate commodity, engages in pumping
such waters from wells bored or drilled into the rock, is
prima facie within the prohibition of the statute, and
must take the burden of showing that he comes within
the exception or qualification, before mentioned, whereby
the statute is made inapplicable where the waters are
not drawn from a common source of supply, and also
where, if they be drawn from such a source, no injury is
done thereby to others having a right to resort to it.
Because of this ruling, which is treated as if read into the
statute, it il insisted that the latter impinges upon the
guarantees of due process of law and equal protection of
the laws., But we think the insistence is untenable, and
for these reasons:
Each State possesses the general power to prescribe
the evidence which shall be received and the effect which
shall be given to it in her own courts, and may exert this
power by providing that proof of a particular fact, or of
several taken collectively, shall be prima facie evidence
of another fact. Many such exertions of this power are

shown in the legislation of the several States, and their
validity, as against the present objection, has been uniformly recognized save where they have been found to be
merely arbitrary mandates or to discriminate invidiously
between different persons in substantially the same situation. Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U. S. 218, 238; Board of
Commissioners v, Merchant, 103 N. Y. 143, 148. The
validity of such a statdte was brought in questiofi in the
recent case of Mobile &c. RailroadCo. v. Turnipseed, 219
U. S. 35, 43, and it was there said by this court:
"That a legislative presumption of one fact from evidence of another may not constitute a denial of due
process of law or a denial of the equal protection of the
law it is only essential that there shall be some rational
connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact
presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof
of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely
arbitrary mandate. So, also, it must not, under guise of
regulating the presentation of evidence, operate to preclude the party from the right to present his defense to
the main fact thus presumed. If a legislative provision,
not unreasonable in itself, prescribing a rule of evidence,
in either criminal or civil cases, does not shut out from
the party affected a reasonable opportunity to submit to
the jury in his defense all of the facts bearing upon the
issue, there is no ground for holding that due process of
law has been denied him."
The statute now before us, as affected by the ruling
mentioned, makes proof of certain designated facts prima
facie, but not conclusive, evidence of the common source
of the waters and of the injurious effect of the pumping,
that is to say, it establishes a rebuttable presumption
but neither prevents the presentation of other evidence
to overcome it nor cuts off the right to make a full defense. As respects the source of the waters, the presumption appropriately may be regarded as prompted by the

fact, now'well recognized, that the pervious rock in which
the waters exist usually is of such extent as to reach much
beyond the lands of a singl4 proprietor and to constitute
a common source of supply, and, as respects the effect of
the pumping, the presumption appropriately may be regarded as prompted by the fact, before stated, that
pumping from a common supply in the rock for the purpose of collecting and vending the gas as a separate commodity usually is carried on in a manner which is calculated to affect injuriously, and does so affect, the rights
of others to take from that supply. Regarding the presumption as prompted by these considerations, as we
think should be done, it cannot be said that there is not
a rational connection between the designated facts which
must be proved and the facts which are to be presumed
therefrom until the contrary is shown. What. we have
said upon the subject of classification sufficiently answers
the suggestion or claim that by reason of the presumption
the statute discriminates invidiously between different persons in substantially the same situation.
For these reasons none of the objections urged against
the statute can be sustained, and so the decree dismissing
the bill is
