UNITED STATES v. ATCHISON, T. & S. F. RY. CO. 37
220 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

UNITED STATES v.1 ATCHISON, TOPEKA AND
SANTA FE RAILWAY COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 504. Argued February 28, 1911.-Decided March 13, 1911.
In determining whether an office is one continuously operated, a
trifling interruption will not be considered; and quwre, whether a
railway station shut for two periods of three hours each day and
open the rest of the time is not a station continuously operated
night and day within the meaning of §§ 2 and 3 of the act of
.,March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415.
Under §§ 2 and 3 of the act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stab. 1415, a
telegraph operator employed for six hours and then, after an interval, for three hours, is not employed for a longer period than
nine consecutive hours.
The presence of a provision in one part of a statute and its absence in
another is an argument against reading it as implied where omitted;
and so held that the word " consecutive" is not to be implied in connection with limiting the number of hours during the twenty-four
that telegraph operators can be employed under the act of March 4,
1907.
177 Fed. Rep. 114, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the act
of March 4, 1907, regulating the hours of service of railway employ~s,are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Win. S. Kenyon, Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom The Attorney General and Mr. Philip J.
Doherty, Special Assistant United States Attorney, Were
on the brief, for the United States:

The telegraph office at Corwith was "continuously operated night and day" within the meaning of the statute.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Argument for the United States.

220 U. S.

United Railways Co., 91 Maryland, 347. Such was the
intent of Congress.
The distinction was between offices "operated only
during the daytime" on the one hand and those operated
"night and day" on the other hand. No distinction was
attempted or intended between offices operated without
interruption all day and all night, and such as were operated practically all day and all night, but not without
interruption for one or another reason. , Congress intended by the proviso to legislate concerning all offices,
towers, etc.
In using the language in question Congress was merely
classifying offices into two general classes and was not
attempting exact definitions of either class; too much significance should not be given to a single word, but the
general purpose of Congress should be carried out by construction.
The word "continuously" may be read in the sense of
"regularly" or "habitually" or "customarily." Hodge v.
U. S. Steel Corporations,64 N. J. Eq. 807.
There is nothing in the statute which says that the
operations must continue all day and all night.
As to the meaning of the expression "on duty for a
longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour
period," the purpose of the act is to secure rest for the
employ6 in order that he may be able better to do his
work with more safety to the public. Such rest should be
a continuous rest, not intermittent, as would be possible
under the construction contended for by defendants.
The Government contends that the term "on duty for
a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour
period" is plain, and that the word period must be given
some significance; that the period commences when the
operator goes to work and continues nine hours therefrom. The word "period" cannot be construed as an
unmeaning and useless word in this statute; it carries

UNITED STATES v. ATCHISON, T. & S. F. RY. CO. 39

Argument for the United States.

with it the idea of a cycle, a term. A man works for a
period of time. That may not mean that he works every
hour of the time; that he cannot stop for lunch or sleep;
but whether he stops or whether he works, the period goes
on. Sampson v. Peaslee, 20 How. 571; 22 Am. & Eng.
Ency. Law, 678; see definition in Webster and Standard
Dictionary and Crabb's English Synonyms, p. 799; People

288; Re Becker, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1115; Sutherland on Stat.
Const., 2d ed., § 369.
The railroad's practice of splitting tricks breaks into
the consecutive hours of rest which it was the intention
of Congress that operators should have. Even if this is
a penal statute, the forced and technical construction
contended for by respondent should not be given. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 357; United
States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76; United States v. Morris,
14 Pet. 464; People v. Bartow, 6 Cowan, 290.
The mischief sought to be remedied is the splitting of
tricks and the long hours of service. The remedy is continuous hours of rest. Hence, a period of nine hours of
duty and no more in any twenty-four hour period. See
Heyden's Case, 3 Coke, 7; Endlich on Interp. Stat., § 103;
Potter's Dwarris, Stat. Constr., 194.
The act is remedial. When statutes are primarily
remedial and the penal provisions are merely incidental
to its enforcement, they are to be construed, if not liberally, at least so as to accomplish the congressional purpose. Johnson v. So. Pac. R. R. Co., 196 U. S. 1, 17;

The law is a fair, reasonable and appropriate exercise of
the powers of Congress.
Mr. Robert Dunlap, with whom Mr. Gardiner Lathrop
was on the brief, for respondent:
The office in which the operators in question worked
was not one "continuously operated night and day"
within the purview of the statute and, therefore, such
operators were not confined to nine hours' work. Their
case fell rather under the general sixteen-hour provision.
. Supplying the words which are necessarily omitted for
the sake of brevity, the phrase would read, "offices, etc.,
which are continuously operated during the night and
daytime." See State v. Vanderbilt, 37 Ohio St. 598; Black
v. D. & H. Canal Co., 22 N. J. Eq. 402; Garrisonv. United

cases out of general provisions. United States v. Dickson,

But if the nine-hour provision were applicable yet defendant would not be liable, since it did not permit
operators at this office to be on duty longer than nine
hours in any twenty-four hour period and the law does
not forbid a splitting of the time or adjustment of the
hours of service.
The manifest purpose of the law was to fix the number
of hours of labor required and not the period within which
by agreement the given number of hours of labor should be
performed, beyond the limit prescribed of "any twentyfour hour period."
As to the word "period " in congressional legislation, see
chap. 3594, 34 Stat. 607; H. R. Rep. 7641, 59th Cong., 2d
Sess., on "Limiting the Hours of Service of Railroad
Employ6s."
For Congress to undertake to say that the hours of
work could only be consecutive and may not by agreement of the parties be distributed within the period of a
day, would exceed the limit of police power and seriously
impinge upon the liberty of contract. Lochner v. New

It is plain that Congress was considering the question
of the number of hours of labor which should be fixed and
was seeking to prohibit employs from working an excessive number of hours a day.
A sensible construction should be adopted and one not
leading to any unreasonable or absurd consequences.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action to recover penalties for violation of thb
'Act to promote the safety of employ6s and travellers
upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of employ6s thereon.' March 4, 1907, c. 2939, §§ 2, 3, 34 Stat.
1415, 1416. The Government had a verdict in the District Court, subject to exceptions, and the judgment was
reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 177 Fed. Rep.
114. 100 C. C. A. 534.
The case is this: By § 2 it is made unlawful for common
carriers subject to the act to permit any employ6 subject
to the act to be on duty 'for a longer period than sixteen
consecutive hours,' or after that period to go on duty
again until he has had at least ten consecutive hours off

UNITED STATES v. ATCHISON, T. & S. F. RY. CO. 43

Opinion of the Court.

duty, or eight hours after sixteen hours' work in the aggregate: Provided that no telegraph operator and the like
shall be permitted to be "on duty for a longer period than
nine hours in any twenty-four hour period in all towers,
offices, places and stations continuously operated night
and day, nor for a longer period than thirteen hours in all
towers, offices, places and stations operated only during
the day time," with immaterial exceptions. By § 3 there
is a penalty of not exceeding five hundred dollars for each
violation of § 2. The defendant was subject to the act.
It had a station and telegraph office at Corwith, in the
outer limits of Chicago, which was shut from twelve to
three by day and by night, but open the rest of the time.
The Government contends that this was a place "continuously operated night and day." At this station the
same telegraph operator was employed from half past
six o'clock in the morning until twelve and again from
three P. M. to half past six, or nine hours, in all, of actual
work. The Government contends that when nine hours
have passed from the moment of beginning work the
statute allows no more labor within twenty-four hours
from the same time, even though the nine hours have not
all of them been spent in work. According to the Government's argument the operator's nine hours expired at
half past three in the afternoon. These questions on the
construction of the statute are the only ones that we have
to decide.
We are of opinion that the Government's argument
cannot be sustained, even if it be conceded that Corwith
was a place continuously operated night and day, as there
are strong reasons for admitting. The antithesis is between places continuously operated night and day and
places operated only during the daytime. We think that
the Government is right in saying that the proviso is
meant to deal with all offices, and if so, we should go
farther than otherwise we might in holding offices not

operated only during the daytime as falling under the
other head. A trifling interruption would not be considered, and it is possible that even three hours by night and
three hours by day would not exclude the office from all
operation of the law, and to that extent defeat what we
believe was its intent.
But. if we concede the Government's first proposition
it is impossible to extract the requirement of fifteen hours'
continuous leisure from the words of the statute by
grammatical construction alone. The proviso does not
say nine 'consecutive' hours, as was said in the earlier
part of the section, and if it had said so, or even 'for a
longer period than a period of nine consecutive hours,'
still the defendant's conduct would not have contravened
the literal meaning of the words. A man employed for six
hours and then, after an interval, for three, in the same
twenty-four, is not employed for a longer period than nine
consecutive hours. Indeed, the word consecutive was
struck out, when the bill was under discussion, on the
suggestion that otherwise a man might be worked for a
second nine hours after an interval of half an hour. In
order to bring about the effect contended for it would have
been necessary to add, as the section does add in the earlier
part, a provision for the required number of consecutive
hours off duty. The presence of such a provision in the
one part and its absence in the other is an argument
against reading it as implied. The Government suggests
that if it is not implied a man might be set to work for two
hours on and two hours off alternately. This hardly is a
practical suggestion. We see no reason to suppose that
Congress meant more than it said. On the contrary, the
reason for striking out the word consecutive in the proviso
given, as we have mentioned, when the bill was under discussion, and the alternative reference in § 2 to 'sixteen
consecutive hours' and 'sixteen hours in the aggregate,'
show that the obvious possibility of two periods of service

in the same twenty-four hours was before the mind of
Congress, and that there was no oversight in the choice of
words.

ERROR TO AND APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 519.

Submitted January 5, 1911.-Decided March 13, 1911.

The object of the Pure Food and Drug Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3915,

34"Stat. 768, is to keep adulterated articles out of the channels of
interstate commerce, or if they enter such commerce to condemn
them while in transit, or in original or unbroken packages after
reaching destination; and the provisions of § 10 of the act apply
not only to articles for sale but also to articles to be used as raw
material in the manufacture of some other product.
In construing the Pure Food and Drug Act, all articles, compound or
single, not intended for consumption by the producer, are regarded
as designed for sale, and for that reason it is the concern of the law
to have them pure.
The remedies given by the statute in peronam and by condemnation
are not inconsistent and they are not dependent. The Three Friends,
166 U. S. 1.
By the Pure Food and Drug Act adulterated articles are, while in
interstate commerce, made culpable as well as their shipper; while
in original unbroken packages they can be seized and they carry
their own identification as contraband of law; they are subject to the
power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and they are
not beyond the jurisdiction of the National Government because
within the borders of a State. Quwcre, how far such articles can be
pursued beyond the original package.
