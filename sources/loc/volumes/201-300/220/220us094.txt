BALTIMORE AND OHIO SOUTHWESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF.APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT;
Nos. 7, 8. Argued March 4, 1910; restored to docket for reargument
April 4, 1910; reargued January 5, 6, 1911.-Decided March 20, 1911.
Eyery penal statutb has relation to time and place; and corporations,
whose operations are conducted over a large territory by - many
agents, may commit offenses at-the same time in different places, or
at the sam.e place at diffeient times.
The construction given to an identical former act prior to its reanactment by Congress, that 'penalties thereunder were not measured by
number of cattle'or number of cars, followed. United States v. Boston
& Albany R. R. Co., 15 Fed. Rep. 209; United States v. St. Louis
R.'R. Co., 107 Fed. Rep. 807.
The act of June 29, 1906, c. 3594, 34.Stat. 607, to prevent cruelty to
animals 'in transit, is general and applies to all shipments of cattle
as made. The statdte is not for the benefit of shippers but is restrictive of their rights, and violations are not to be measured by
the number of shippers,' but as to the time when the duty is to be
performed.
Under the act of June 29, 1906, to prevent cruelty to animals in transit,
offenses are separately punishable for every failure to comply with
its provisions by confining animals longer than the prescribed time;
and there Is a separate offense as to each lot of cattle shipped simultaneously as the period expires as to each lot, regardless of the number of shippers or of trains or cars.
Where cases are properly consolidated below, as these and others were,
the aggregate amount of, possible penalties in all the actions consolidated is the measure of the amount in controversy to give jurisdiction to this court.
159 Fed. Rep. 33, modified and affirmed.
"THE act to prevent cruelty to animals while in transit,"
approved June 29, 1906 (c. 3594, 34 Stat. 607), provides:

but the time during which the animals have been confined without such rest or food or water on connecting

prohibit their continuous confinement beyond the period
of 28 hours, except upon the contingencies hereinbefore
stated.

one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars. .
"SEc. 4. That the penalty created by the preceding
section shall be recovered by civil action in the name of
the United States.

Under this act eleven actions were instituted in the
Southern District of Ohio against the Baltimore and Ohio
Southwestern Railway Company.
The complaint in each case gave the name of the station in Illinois from which the animals were shipped to

Cincinnati, the marks of the cars in which they were
shipped, the hour on February 2, 1907, when they were
loaded, and the various periods of confinement, which
varied from 37 to 45 hours. The separate shipments
consisted of one, two, three, and four carload lots, aggregating twenty-one cars, containing several hundred cattle
and hogs. Most of the shipments were loaded at different
times; but because one (1872) was forwarded under the
36-hour rule, the time for its unloading was the same as
that of another shipment (1871), made eight hours later
under the 28-hour rule, froma different station. At another station there were three shipments of one carload
each of cattle, belonging, to different owners loaded at the
same time, but two (1869, 1873) of the cars were forwardedunder the 28-hour rule and the other (1874) under
the 36-hour rule.
The railroad company filed a separate plea in each.case,
admitting the allegations of. the complaint, but setting
up that -"the shipment therein was forwarded to Cincinnati on its train No. 98, on which there were also
loaded and forwarded other cattle, referred to in each of
the other suits, and in the said several causes the said
plaintiff is entitled to recover but one penalty, not to
exceed five hundred dollars, which it is ready and willing
to pay, and it pleads the said separate suits in bar to the
recovery of more than five hundred dollars for all of. the
same."
The district attorney's motions for separate judgments
on the admission in the several pleas were overruled.
The court sustained the company's motion to consolidate
the causes, entered judgment for a single penalty, and
ordered "that the within order-'in case 1866 shall apply
to, operate upon and be conclusive ot all the rights of the
plaintiff in each of the several causes, to wit, 1867-1874,
1880 and 1884." The Government sued out a writ of
error in case 1866 and, apparently out of abundant cau-

tion, another in 1867, later entering into a stipulation iln
the Circuit Court of Appeals that the result in these two
cases should control all the others.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
(159 Fed. Rep. 33), held that the order of consolidation
was proper, but reversed the judgment on the ground
that the United States were entitled to recover eleven penalties or one for each of the eleven shipments.
Mr. Edward Colston, with whom Mr. Judson Harmon,
Mr. A. F. Goldsmith and Mr. George Hoadly were on the
brief, for plaintiff in error:
At the expiration of the 28-hour and also of the 36hour period, all the carp constituted but a single train.
Under § 3, the penalty is for failure to comply with the
requirement that no live stock be confined in cars for a
longer period than 28 hours without unloading. The
number confined, whether estimated by the head, by the
number of shipments, or by the carloads, is unimportant.
Under the Government's claim, if -fifty horses, each belonging to a different shipper but shipped on .the same
train, were detained beyond the statutory time, there
should be fifty penalties, but if all the horses belonged
to the same person and were shipped to the same consignee by the same train, there would be but one penalty.
As to construction of the old statute, §§ 4386, 4388, Rev.
Stat., see United States v. Boston & Albany R. R. Co., 15
Fed. Rep. 209; United States v. St. Louis & S. F. R. R.
Co., 107 Fed. Rep. 870. As Congress knew how the law
had been interpreted in these two decisions and that the
penalty did not multiply by either the number of cattle
or by the number of cars, or by the number of shipments,
it may be considered that a like construction was intended, and was expected to be given to those words.

The practice of the railroads in running solid stock
trains was well known to Congress, and if the Congress
had intended this law should carry the multiple penalties
it would have said so. Whether $500 is not punishment
enough to deter the railroads from violating the statute is
a consideration of the sort that addressed itself to the legislature and not to the judiciary. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R.

Mr. Solicitor General Bowers for the United States on
the original argument; Mr. Assistant Attorney General

Four theories as to the unit of offense have been suggested from time to time. They are: The individual animal, the carload, the trainload, and the shipment. The
individual-animal theory was rejected in United States v.
Boston & Albany R. R. Co., 15 Fed. Rep. 209, as was the
carload theory in United States v. St. Louis'& San Francisco R. Co., 107 Fed. Rep. 870. The trainload theory has
had no substantial support in the lower courts. The
shipment theory has been upheld by all the courts in
which it has been involved excepting the District Court
below. United States v. Balt. & Ohio S. W. R. R. Co., 159

The unit of offense under the act is not a continuing
"confining cattle" in general, but it is the distinct "failure" to unload, feed, water, and rest whatever cattle
shall then and there have completed 28 hours of confinement. It is for "every such failure" that the statute
provides a penalty.

The failures to unload charged in nine of the eleven
cases all occurred at separate tinies and places.
In all of the eleven cases the failures to unload, etc.,
were separate offenses, because the statute intended that
the mistreatment. of cattle of different shipments should
be separate offenses.
An incidental policy of the act is to protect the interests of the owners of the cattle. United States v. Pere

Sess.
The alleged mechanical inconveniences of operating a
train under the shipment theory of this statute can be
and in practice have been surmounted, and in any event
they could not override the intention of Congress.
The natural and normal unit in which railroads deal
with freight is by shipments, and those provisions make
it clear that that point of view is the one taken by this
statute.
The trainload theory has no affirmative recognition
in the statute, and not even, practical railroad administration requires it. Furthermore, it would tend to make
the statute ineffective because the penalty which it
would provide is so small.
Under the stipulation in this case this court has not jurisdiction; only two cases, each involving $500, are appealed, and the total amount in controversy is only $1,000.
The amount in controversy in a case is not measured by
the full amount of plaintiff's claim when defendant ad-

mits or agrees to a part of it, but is measured by the excess of plaintiff's claim above what defendant admits or
acquiesces in. Jenness v. Citizens' Nat. Bank, 110 U. S.

And the matter in dispute is the amount involved on
the writ of error-not necessarily the same as was involved
below. Gordon v. Ogden, 3 Pet. 33. The amount in dispute
may, and must, be determined from the whole record.
Bowman v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., 115 U. S.611, 613.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion Qf the court.

The consolidated record of the eleven cases shows that
several hundred cattle and hogs of eleven different owners,
shipped in 21 cars, loaded at different stations at various
hours on February 2, 1907, were in one train at the time
of the expiration of the successive periods for the unloading required by the act of 1906, "to prevent cruelty to
animals in transit." The question is as to the number of
penalties for which, in such a case, the carrier is liable.
Under the nearly identical act of 1873, Rev. Stat. § 4386,
it was held that the penalties were not to be measured by
the number of cattle in the shipment, nor the number of
cars in which they were transported. United States v.
Boston & Albany R. R. Co., 15 Fed. Rep. 209; United
States v. St. Louis R. R. Cc., 107 Fed. Rep. 807. And the
company contends that as the cattle here were in -one
train the failure to unload was one offense, punishable
by one penalty. In support of its position it relies, among
others, on authorities which hold that in larceny, if the
goods stolen at one time belong to several persons the
offense is single; and that, on conviction for working on
Sunday, there is only one breach of the statute, the penalty for which cannot be multiplied by the number of
items of work done on the day of rest.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

But this does not mean, that if the thief should, at a
different time, steal property from the same place, he
could not be punished for the new transaction, nor that
because a man had been ' convicted for working on one
Sunday he could not be convicted and punished for subsequently working on a different Sunday. For every
penal statute must have relation to time and place, and
corporations whose operations are conducted over a large
territory, by many agents, may commit offenses at the
same time in different places, or at the same place at different times.
Here the 21 cars, loaded at different periods, had been
gathered into one train. As the period of lawful confinement of the cattle first loaded expired, there was a failure
to unload. For that failure the statute imposed a penalty.
But there was then no offense whatever as to the animals
in the other 20 cars of the same train, which, up to that
time, had not been confined for 28 hours.
When, however, later in the day, at the. same or a different place, the time for the lawful confinement of the
animals in the other 20 cars successively expired, there
were similar, but distinct and separate failures then and
there to unload. They were separately punishable, since
the provision that "for every such failure" the company
shall be liable to a penalty prevented a merger. If the
period of lawful confinement of several carloads of cattle
expires at the same time and place, and the company
fails to unload them as required by the statute, and if
these cattle all belong to one owner, it is conceded- that
there is only one offense. It is not different if the-same
cattle, at the same time and place, had belonged to various
owners, or had been shipped under different consignments.
Several expressions in the statute, and particularly the
provision that, in estimating the period of lawful confinement, "the time consumed in loading and unloading
shall not be considered," recognize that the proper load-

B..& 0. SOUTHWEST N R R. v. UNITED STATES. 105
220 U. S.

Opinion of

the Court.

ing or unloading of a number of animals may be treated
as a single act, and there is nothing to indicate that it is
to be treated as more than one act because the animals
happen to belong to different persons. The loading of
numerous cars might proceed concurrently; or if not discontinuous or unduly prolonged several cars of cattle of the
same consignor might be loaded at the same time within
the meaning of the act, in which event the period of their
lawful confinement, on the same train, would end at the
same time and place. There would in this latter case be
coincidence between the one shipment and the one offense.
But in determining whether the number of penalties is
always to be measured by the number of shipments on
the same train, even when the animals were loaded at
different times, it is to be remembered that the statute is
general. It applies to the transportation of a trainload
of cattle belonging to one owner; to the more usual case
where animals belonging to one or more owners are loaded
into different cars at different times, and als-o to those
instances where one or a few horses or other animals are
shipped and at a different time or farther on during the
journey other animals are loaded into the same car. These
differences in shipments, do not affect the duty of the
carrier to the animals, but only the time when the duty
to unload is to be performed. The number of consignors,
the consent of the owner or agent in charge of the particular shipment that the cattle might be confined for
36 hours, the number of bills of lading and the particulars
of the shipment are .immaterial, except as they serve to
fix the limit of lawful confinement.
To illustrate: It appears in this record that several
hundred animals belonging to one owner and consigned
to one dealer were loaded into four cars at the same time.
The 28 hourg of their lawful confinement necessarily expired at the same time. The simultaneous failure to unload these four cars was single, and punishable as a single

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

offense. But the duty and offense in this transaction
would not have been quadrupled if the company had
issued to the owner four bills of lading instead of one.
Nor would there have been any increase of duty if these
same cattle had been received from four consignors instead of one.
The statute was not primarily intended for the benefit
of the owners. Indeed, it is restrictive of their rights.
The penalty does not go to the consignor, but to the
United States for each failure to unload cattle, regardless
of who may own them; and even if the owner consented
to their confinement beyond a period of 36 hours. The
title of the act is" to prevent cruelty to animals in transit,"
its declared "intent being to prohibit their continuous
confinement beyond a period of 28 hours, except upon the
contingencies hereinbefore stated." Regardless of the
number of shipments, at any time and place where they are
willfully and knowingly confined beyond the lawful period
there is a violation of the statute as to the animal or animals then and there in custody for transit in interstate
commerce.
The point is made in the brief that this court has no
jurisdiction, because the amount involved in the cases
embraced in these writs of error was only $1,000. The
court, we think properly, consolidated all the cases (Rev.
Stat., § 921) and, as consolidated, the amount of the
possible penalties sued for in the eleven actions was fiftyfive hundred dollars. The company is liable for nine
penalties, because nine times it failed to unload as required by the statute. One penalty should be imposed
as to animals referred to in cases numbered 1871 and 1872,
and one as to those in 1869 and 1873, where the time for
the required unloading respectively coincided.
In other respects the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of the District Court is
affirmed.
