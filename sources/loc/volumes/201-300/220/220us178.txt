MAINE BAPTIST MISSIONARY CONVENTION v.
COTTING.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

Nos. 448, 496.

Argued January 19, 1911.-Decided March .13, 1911.

It was the intention of Congress to embrace within the corporation tax
provisions of the Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112,
only such corporations and joint stock associations as are organized
under some statute, or derive from that source some quality or
benefit not existing at the common law.
A trust formed in a State, where statutory joint stock companies are
unknown, for the purpose of purchasing, improving, holding and
selling land, and which does not have perpetual succession but ends
with lives in being and twenty years thereafter, is not within the
provisions of the Corporation Tax Law.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the Corporation Tax Law, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Moorfield Storey, with whom Mr. Richard W. Hale
and Mr. Frank W. Grinnell were on the brief, for appellant
in No. 448:
The respondent trustees are not-taxable under the act
as they are not "carrying on or doing business."
The ownership of real estate protected by the Constitution is a practical right. The property may be owned and
managed in the same way by oie individual, by partners,
by a testamentary trustee or trustees, or by a trustee or
trustees under a trust inter vivos, as in this case. In any
case the owner is "busy" about his ownership in the
colloquial sense, but in no ,legal sense is he "engaged in

business." Smith v. Anderson, L. R. 15,Ch. D. 247, 276.
A direct tax and an excise tax differ in their essence, and
this difference is not obliterated by misnaming either.
However broad a meaning may be given to the phrase
"excise tax" it does not include a direct tax. Thomas v.
United States, 192 U. S. 363, 370; Patten v. Brady, 184
U. S. 6i7, 618; Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 348; Galveston Ry.
Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217. The real estate trust in this
case is not a joint stock company nor is it a joint stock
association. Smith v. Anderson, L. R. 15 Ch. D. 247,
275.
By the act, it is not enough to create a liability to the
tax that the beneficial intere~t in the property is owned
in shares, but it is necessary that there be a joint stock
company or association with a capital stock represented
by shares.
The form of organization to be taxed is described in the
act. The trust was not "organized for profit."
The purpose of the trust under consideration is the
management of two parcels of land for the benefit of the
owners. A company organized for such purposes would
not be a company organized for profit. Reg. v. Whitmarsh, 15 Q. B. 600, 618;Boar v. Bromley, 18 Q. B. 271,
276, 277; Moore v. Rawlins, 6 C. B. (N. S.) 289, 315,
323; Smith v. Anderson, L. R. 15 Ch. Div. 247, 273 et seq.
The defendants have not "a capital stock represented
by shares" within the meaning of the act. Corey on Accounts (London, 1839), 90, 91. There is no capital stock
"represented by shares." See 28 Op. A. G. 194 (Feb. 14,
1910). Under Massachusetts law the respondents are
merely trustees. Mayo v. Moritz, 151 Massachusetts,
481, and see Howe v. Morse, 174 Massachusetts, 491, 502;
Phillips v. Blatchford, 137 Massachusetts, 510. Mere
transferability of shares under a private contract is an
immaterial fact. Gleason v. McKay, 134 Massachusetts,

(1908). The defendants are not an association organized
under the laws of any State or country. Swift v. Tyson,
16 Pet. 1, 18; B. & 0. R. R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U. S.369,
371.
The expression "'organized under the laws of" plainly
refers to an organization under some statute, law authorizing such organization. Taft v. Ward, 106 Massachusetts,
518, 522; Edwards v. Warren Gasoline Works, 168 Massachusetts, 564; Oliver v. Liverpool &c. Co., 100 Massachusetts, 531"; S. C. 10 Wall. 566; People v. Wemple, 117 N. Y.
136; Gregg v. Sanford et al., 05 Fed. Rep. 151.
A statute will not be construed so as to violate the
Constitution "unless its lafiguage imperatively demands
it." Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, 187
U. S. 197, 205; United States v. Del. & Hudson Co., 213
'U.S. 366, 407.
If the act is construed as imposing a tax on the income
of the respondents in this case it is unconstitutional, for
a tax on the income is a tax on the land, and therefore a
direct tax, which must be levied according to the rule of'
apportionment. Pollock v. Farmers' L. & T. Co., 157
U. S. 429; S. C., 158 U. S. 601; Knowlton v. Moore; 178

U. S. 82. This limitation on the power of Congress
cannot be evaded by the act under which this case
arises.
But even if the tax is treated as an excise tax it cannot
be sustained, for it lacks uniformity throughout the
United- States, United States v. Singer, 15 Wall. 111, 121,
which is of the very essence of constitutional law. Kitty

The tax

cannot be sustained as an excise tax without infringing
the restrictions of the Constitution.
The whole act is unconstitutional because it invades the
sovereignty of the States.
Mr. Charles H. Tyler, Mr. Owen D. Young, Mr. Burton
E. Eames and Mr. Clement F. Robinson for appellants in
No. 496:
The statute should be strictly limited to objects clearly

No tax is laid. upon these trusts in Massachusetts except the ordinary tax upon the property. This property
is taxed to the trustees like the property of: any other, trust.
The beneficiaries have a purely equitable interest in the
property and no tax is laid upon their interest. Hussey v.

100 Massachusetts, 531; S. C. 10 Wall. 566, distinguished.
The only reasonable interpretation of the act excludes
real .estate trusts. The appellant has no "capital stock
represented by shares." In Massachusetts the holder of
shares (so called) in a real estate trust has merely an
equitable interest in the property which is held by the
trustees. Hussey v. Arnold, Kinney v. Stevens, supra.
This trust is not "carrying on or doing business." Parker
Mills v. Tax Commissioners, 23 N. Y. 242; In re, Ala. &
Chait. R. R. Co., 9 Blatchf. 390.
There is real distinction between "business" on the one
hand and "investment" on the other; and the term
"business'" can no more include "investment" than the
term "activity" can include "inactivity." If interpreted
so as to include real estate trusts the act would be uncofistitutional.
There was no appearance or brief filed for appellee in
either case.
The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Henry E. Colton,
•Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on the
brief, for the United. States, by leave of the Court:
The corporation tax applies to joint stock companies
and associations organized under the common law of the
respective' States.
The act of Congress uses the word "laws," and not
statutes." Had it intended the lesser scope of the latter
word it is a fair presumption that it would have used that
word. The common law is just as much as the statutes a
part of the laws of a State, and the statutes are often
nothing more than declarations of the common law.

Besides, joint stock companies organized "under the
laws of any foreign country" are also made subject to the
tax. Congress did not intend to tax foreign joint stock
companies if organized under the statutory law of a
foreign country, but not to tax them if organized under
its customary laws.
The conclusion to be drawn from the use of the word
"every" and from the meaning of the words "joint stock
company," "organized," and "laws" is that the express
language of the section subjects joint stock companies,
though organized under the common law of a State or
Territory, to the tax.
The Cushing Real Estate Trust and the Department
Store Trust are common-law joint stock companies.

in the consideration of the corporation tax cases just decided. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., ante, p. 107.

In No. 448 the question is raised as to the right to lay
a tax under this statute upon a certain trust, formed for
the purpose of purchasing, improving, holding and selling
lands and buildings in Boston, known as The Cushing
Real Estate Trust. By the terms of the trust the property
was conveyed to certain trustees, who executed a trust
'agreement whereby the management of the property was
vested in- the trustees, who had absolute control and authority over the same, with right to sell for cash or credit,
at public -or private sale, and with full power to manage
the property as they deemed best for the interest of the
shareholders. The shareholders are to be paid dividends
from time to time from the net income or net proceeds of
the property, and twenty years after the termination of
lives in being the property to be sold and the proceeds of
the sale to be divided among the parties interested. The
trustees. were to issue 4,800 shares to the owners of the
property-at $100 each, the owners to receive a number of
shares equal to the value of the interest conveyed to the
trustees. The shares were transferable on the books of
the trustees, and on surrender of the certificate and the
'transfer thereof in writing'a new certificate is 'to issue to
the transferee. No shareholder had any legal title or interest in the property and no right to call for the partition
thereof during the continuance of the trust. The legal
representatives of a shareholder are to succeed to the interest of a shareholder, the interest passing by operation
of law. Provision is made for the termination of the trust
by an instrument or instruments in writing, signed by not
less than three-fourths of the. value of stock held.by shareholders. Meetings of the shareholders are held at their
discretion, or whenever requested in writing by five shareholders, or by shareholders owning not less than onetenth of the shares.in value.

ELIOT v. FREEMAN.
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The trust has a building, leasing it to a single tenant.
It also maintains and operates an office building with
elevator service, janitor service, etc.
Case No. 496 involves what is known as a Department
Store Trust. It was created by deed and formed for the
purpose of purchasing and holding certain parcels of land
in the city of Boston, and erecting a building thereon
suitable for a department store. The land and buildings
are leased to one tenant for a period of thirty years. The
trust had transferable certificates issued to shareholders
at the par value of $100 each. The trustees conduct the
affairs of the trust, manage the property, and pay dividends when declared. The shareholders meet annually,
and a majority of them have the power to elect and depose
trustees and to alter and amend the terms of the trust
agreement. This trust also continues for certain lives in
being and for twenty years thereafter. Each of the trusts
involved in these cases is in receipt of a net income exceeding $5,000.
Under the. terms of the Corporation Tax Law, corporations and joint, stock associations must be such as are
"•now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United
States or of any.State or Territory of the United States or
under the acts of Congress applicable to Alaska or the
District of Columbia."
The pertinent question in this connection is: Are these.
trusts organized under the laws of the State? As we have
construed the Corporation Tax Law in the previous cases,
Flint v. Stone Tiacy Cod,, ante, the tax is imposed upon
doing business in a corporate or. quasi-corporate capacity,
that s, with the facility: or advantage of :corporate organization.
It was' the purpose of the act to treat corporations and
-joint stock companies, similarly organized, in the same
way, and assess them upon the facility in doing business
which is substantially the same in both .forms of organiza-

tion. Joint stock organizations are not infrequently organized under the statute laws of a State, deriving therefrom, in a large: measure, the characteristics of a corporation:
The language of the act "
now or hereafter
organized under the laws of the United States," etc., imports an organization deriving power from 'statutory enactment. The statute does not say under the law of the
United States, or a State, or lawful in the United States or
in any State, but is made applicable t& such as are organized under the laws of the United States, etc. The description of the corporation or joint stock association as
one organized under the laws of a State at once suggests
that they are such as are the creation of statutory law,
from which they derive their powers and are qualified to
carry on their operations.
A trust of the character of those here involved can
hardly be said to be, organized, within the ordinary meaning of that term; it certainly is not organized under
.statutory laws as corporations are. The difference between joint stock associations at common law and those
organized under statutes is well recognized (Cook on
Corporations, § 505):
"There is an essential difference between a joint stock
company as it exists at common law and a joint stock
company 'having extensive statutory powers conferried
upon it by the State within which it is organized. The
latter kind of joint stock company is found in England
and in the State of New York. To such an extent have
these statutory powers' been conferred" on joint stock
companies that the only substantial difference, between
them and corporations is that the members are not
exempt from liability as partners for 'the debts of the
company."
The two cases now under consideration embrace trusts
which do not derive any benefit from. and are not or-

ganized under the statutory laws of Massachusetts.
Joint stock companies of the statutory character are not
known to the laws of that Commonwealth. Ricker v.
American L. & T. Co., 140 Massachusetts, 346. These
trusts do not have perpetual succession, but end with
lives in being and twenty years thereafter.
Entertaining the view that it was the intention of Congres to embrace within the corporation tax statute only
such corporations and joint stock associations as are
organized under some statute, or derive from that source
some quality or benefit not existing at the common law,
we are of opinion that the real estate trusts involved in
these two cases are not within the terms of the act. In
that view the decrees in both cases will be reversed and
the same remanded to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Massachusetts with directions
to overrule the demurrers and for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

and proceeds of disposition of the land, and which has disqualified
itself from doing any other business, is not a corporation doing busi'nss within the meaning of the corporation tax provisions of the
act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, and is not subject to the
tax.
